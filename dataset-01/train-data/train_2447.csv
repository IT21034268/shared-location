3,Reader beware..,"The book is about a male model who unwittingly trades his world of glamour for one of terror and terrorism...Two reviews:1: If you've read American Psycho: be warned that this is fundamentally more of the same, with the addition of more complex and confusing plotting.2: If you haven't. Be warned that the violence and sex can be so graphic as to be literally stomach churning, without the ameliorating sense of righteousness that you get in something like 'Saving Private Ryan'. Also be warned that the plot is very unclear and you will most likely feel confused at times. The symbolism is heavy-handed, as many here have commented.Redeeming features? Mainly the frenetically-paced and witty dialogue, the wonderfully imaginative prose. Love it or hate it, the book will certainly challenge you as a work of art if not as philosophy."
2,Beautiful People in a Really Bad Book,"The only thing vaguely interesting about this book is that it takes place around beautiful and famous people. The main character, Victor Ward, is a thoroughly dislikable semi-famous moron. There is no story for three hundred pages and then an idiotic one--supermodels as terrorists. I kept hoping it was a spoof.Ellis tries to pull some little tricks like fading in and out of a movie shoot and mixing up the chapter numbers and 'inserting' some lead-handed symbolism like cold and confetti all over the place. I was embarresed for him."
5,brilliant,"This is the best book I have ever read. It was so out of control and engrossing I couldn't stop reading it. The confusion, heathenism, specs and stench is all too much."
2,Maybe his worst,"I've read Mr. Ellis's Less Then Zero, Amer. Psycho and Rules of Attraction and enjoyed all three of them more then Glamorama.Glamorama takes similiar themes from Amer Psycho and makes them more outlandish but Patrick Bateman is a far more intriguing character then Victor Ward/Johnson.The book does get better after Victor leaves NYC and heads toward Europe (the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1)but I was at this point reading the book just to finish it as I was fairly bored by the non-stop celebrity babble.Lastly some of the characters were still in college in Rules of Attraction so if you've read Amer Psycho and are dying to read more by Ellis at least read Rules... first and then Glamorama but don't be surprised if Glamorama is a disappointment."
1,Horrible Drivel,"I can't help but leave a few words of contempt for Ellis' work. ""Glamorama"" was nothing but a wild conglomeration of mindless, obnoxious BS. The character introductions in the first chapter absolutely sickened me with so much hartred and disgust that I was unable to focus througout the rest of the novel. Sure, Ellis does have a knack for realistic and flowing dialogue, but with so many perephial characters who basically all revolved around each other's sick, sad, lives, towards the end of the book I felt like I would rather live as a deformed hermit for the rest of my existence than spend even an second with these [characters]. I understand that the purpose of the novel is to reveal the whole psychosis associated with 'glamour,'(yes, psychosis) as in American Psycho's corporate banking plot, yet the absence of any sympathetic characters made the book literally unbearable. Do not read this book,it will be a complete waste of your time."
1,first half - great! second half - totally out of control,"The first 100 pages were slick, self-mocking and very, very funny. The rest of the book descended into chaos and confusion and truly I didn't care what happened to any of them. Does anyone know what the ending means - I'd love to know!"
4,"it's fun, which is what counts","Bret Ellis' gift as an author is that he has an ear for the nuances of conversation, thought and interaction; nobody can fake this, and it really comes through in his books. This is why he can construct a shallow party-boy like Victor Ward, and then make the reader CARE about what becomes of him when he crashes into a world of terrorism, espionage and killer models. More than anything else, Ellis has a writing style that draws the reader in. His novels are witty enough and clever enough and written with a seeming ease that makes you WANT to keep reading them. 'Glamorama' is a wry and intelligent book, and it will keep you awake at night as you try to fit the pieces of the mystery together. For good writing, this is right up there with Ellis' best, 'Rules Of Attraction', and if you're a fan, 'Glamorama' is the kind of book that you will look forward to reading again and again."
1,Anagram: See L.A. Snob Litter,"More unintentional laughs from the Jackie Susann of my generation. As long as people never tire of reading about how tough the beautiful, rich and/or famous have it over the rest of us, writers like Ellis will always find a book contract; his tendency toward endless streams of ""ironic"" name-dropping and product-placement ensures that he will be taken seriously in publishing circles. Ellis novels are the kind of novels that characters in Ellis novels might read--or at least have displayed on their Phillipe Starck coffee tables; mere decoration, they remain untouched and unread."
1,Did we read the same book?????,"OMG, this book was awful. Can we give negative stars? I think Bret Ellis actually owes Amazon stars for selling this crap. The characters are completely unlikeable, irrelevent and vapid at best. The plot is completely, utterly ridiculous. The dialogue is confusing and nonsensical. Trees gave up their lives for these pages!!! They lived in vain if this is the result of their time on earth. I love love love stories about celebrities, Hollywood, models, etc....I love suspense and intrigue...I love to read...but this was a pile of mess. Read the dictionary. Read the comics in your local newspaper. Read the back of your cereal boxes. Read ANYTHING, but don't read this."
4,"Great first third, Ellis is a big talent.","The plot was banal, the juxtaposition of glamour and violence became tedious but the night club opening that ends act one is so well written that F.Scott Fitzgerald would have been jealous. Ellis is funny, sophisticated and he is above all, brave. The inside jokes and the names he chose to drop cracked me up. For anyone who has spent any time in the N.Y.,L.A. scene it was like thumbing through an old address book."
1,"weak, insipid","How is it that THE SIMPSONS manages, every week and for free, to do a smarter job of lancing America's boils than this ""novel,"" allegedly 8 years in the writing? Pass."
2,What a Mess,"Glamorama is a mess. Lacking logic and form, this novel races to its absurd finish without ever looking back and asking why. I did enjoy the first 150 pages or so...the fast and furious name dropping was amusing, and the dialogue was off-center and fun. I don't know what happened to Mr. Ellis after that. There are passages of disturbingly gratuitous violence and torture. I have a pretty strong stomach, but some of this was too much to take. And finally, as a twentysomething reader, I found little if anything to identify with in this book. Two stars."
3,The Star Report,"Combine Kenneth Starrs salacious (possibly 1998's most over used word)Starr Report, plus a Years worth of New York Magazine articles incessantly praising Cosmopolitans, (possibly the most cliched cocktail in Town)Prada (The most overhyped Label) and Balthazar (thankfully replaced by Lot 61 as the most overtalked about restaurant in New York) a healthy dose of Lost Highwayesque (David Lynch Film)wierdness and viola Glamorama! As a New Yorker I have only three words for Glamorama: passe, passe, passe."
1,You'll hate yourself in the morning...,"...or perhaps you'll just hate yourself. From the first page, I was exhausted. By page two I was angry. By page five, I had already gone through the Elizabeth Kubler-Ross stages of death - but instead of reaching ""acceptance"" I just called ATT and asked for Dr. Kevorkian's home number. I just wanted the pain to stop, you know? Yeah, I'm bitter.. who wouldn't be? He got 500,000 in US dollars for this elongated InStyle profile. Clearly, Random House has lost thier collective marbles, not to mention thier credibility. Those folks in New York should do less indoor smoking and more editing. (No offense to Disney, proud owners of the irrelevant island of Manhattan - the lengths a city will go to for a Pocahontas tie-in, huh?)File this one under CRAPORAMA."
1,If you like reading lists...,"This is the worst book I've ever read my entire life. It is merely a series of lists-- lists of celebrity names, restaurant names, fashion designer names... The story doesn't really seem to start until page 285, forcing the reader to hash through 285 pages of drivel."
1,What was the point?,"Ok i just got done reading this book and screamed Why did i just waste like 8 hours of my life reading it? This is the most worthless piece of literature i have ever read. From the beginning sequence about ""specks"" to the ultraviolent ending this is not a book i would recommend be even published again. what a waste of money and time. At least we know now who the real ""american psycho"" is."
1,only if you like Ellis,"Vapid prose, useless dialogue, faulty plot, hanging conclusion, what else? I am not a fan of Ellis', but attempted to read this book to see what he might come up with this time around. Disappointing at best - come to think of it, I am changing my rating to 1 star. Middle section is decent. Only worth reading if you have too much time on your hands."
1,Glamorama is a complete waste of time and paper.,"If you insist on reading this garbage, do as I did and borrow it from the library - that way, you won't feel guilty about wasting your money after quitting halfway through!"
3,Dazed and confused,"What is happening in this book? I've rarely been so infuriated by a novel, while finding myself unable to put it down. Some of the writing is out of this world and the first section in Manhattan is a satirical joy, peopled with totally objectional characters and describing an unbelievably shallow world of fashion models and jet-setters. However, when the action shifts to Europe and starts getting nasty, things start seeming all too contrived. Maybe the author is just much more at home in Manhattan. The violence is absolutely sickening at times in the latter sections and the plotting becomes incoherent and hard to follow. By the way, BEE should have hired someone to check on his Paris geography - most of it is spot on but a there are a few howlers in there. All in all, a dazing and confusing book with moments of perfection and others of total abjection."
1,Not a good buy,"I have owned several of these and they all broke in a very short time. I have limited mobility and the gripper is a great help to me, but I could not afford to keeping buying them over and over again. I have had at least 8. I finally found one that is durable and will last, it is made by Arcoa and they come in various lengths.Arcoa E-Z Reacher Pro: [...]"
5,"Beautiful, Well Executed, Relaxing Music","An American Mosiaic is a delight for both the sophistocated and unsophistocated ear. The music created by these professional musicians (harpist anf flutist) brings warmth, relaxation and joy into one's life. The variety in this ""mosaic"" or collection keeps one's interest. Also, the pieces have historical significance in the music world. How fortunate for us these talented women decided bring to into our lives beautiful music that would otherwise be overlooked."
4,Encyclopedic but readable,"The style is light, even glib, but still demanding. The prerequisites are not stated, but I would say undergraduate logic, graduate algebra, and a good deal of general mathematical experience. Motivation and context are very good and examples are frequent and clearly illustrative. What makes it challenging is that many details are glossed-over without the reader being warned about what knowledge is being assumed. His proofs also make many off-hand references rather than include every detail. Another thing I think it could use is more illustration of procedures; all of the examples seem to be of cases rather than methods. Still, explanations of specific points are often much clearer than in Marker."
5,Hodges' Model Theory,"Vast in scope, full of careful attention to detail; proofs are generally clear and well-turned. Style is generally more accessible than that of a typical graduate textbook. Contains generous bibliography. This properly a reference and not a textbook, but would serve well the interested novice."
2,"Too, too small","This camera fits in the palm of my hand. My fault: I didn't check the dimensions before ordering. This camera is way too small to even be seen. I pointed it out to my neighbor and he said ""Where? Where is it? I don't see it."" I was shocked at how small it is as the photos of it make it look like it's about 12"" long when it's really about 4 or 5 inches long. Disappointed!"
4,GOOD CAMERA,LOOKS SO REAL THAT IT WILL KEEP PEOPLE AWAY FROM YOUR PROPERTY. EASY TO INSTALL AND BATERY LIFE IS GOOD UP TO 2 YEARS. KEEPS MY BROTHER FROM USEING OUR HOT TUB... AS HE THINKS WE HAVE SECURITY.
4,"As Advertised, good product",Installed quickly and looks very real. The blinking LED could be a bit brighter but overall should be a good deterrent.
3,ITS OK BUT TOO SMALL!,"This is a very NICE camera,BUT it is way too SMALL it would be nice if they were bigger so you could see it better!"
4,"Great memories, no extras...","I purchased this series primarily to see formerly well-known actors past their prime in the 1970s. I remember watching many of these episodes on their first run, so the format is familiar, but the retro 70s flashback is great.The plots are pretty thin and telegraphed. The fun is in seeing the likes of Henry Gibson and Jane Powel acting out their fantasies under the watchful eye of Mr Roarke. There are also memorable episodes such as Bert Convey trying to escape from Devil's Island with the help of Robert Clarey (Sgt LeBeau).If any of this means something to you, then it is worth having a look. The packaging is fine, and the DVD copies are mostly clean (not HD, and with some picture 'noise'), but there are no extras. So, if you were hoping for an insider's look with Ricardo Montalban or a shmooze with Herve Villachez, look elsewhere."
5,Memories Galore!,"I loved this show when it was on Network TV. I love it just as much on the DVD. Fun to see all the stars that I haven't seen for awhile. ""Da Plane, Da Plane!"" Great entertainment."
5,i always dug me some Fantasy Island,"Mr. Roarke&Tattoo always welcomed guests for a Fantasy that could go in so many directions. the first season was something else. i dug all the episodes. back in the day I use to watch Fantasy Island&the Love Boat on ABC on Saturdays. Fantasy Island always was cool with the twists&turns that went down. all the first season episodes plus the film are all here. this was a cool show back in the day. The Plane Boss, The Plane Boss. smiles Everyone, Smiles Everyone."
3,Very average TV show,"I watched this show pretty regularly as a kid, but it is easier to impress a kid than an adult. It is a good example of 70's TV. It has it's good moments, but there are a LOT of bad moments. Tattoo, while he fulfills his purpose on the show, is not a good actor. Mr. Roarke, Ricardo Montalbon, does ok with what he had to work with, but this is far inferior to the quality he usually put out. If you like nostalgia, you do get to see a lot of A and B level actors from the 70's as they guest star on there respective episodes. I should have passed on this one."
4,Super Cheesy but fun!,This show is the cheesiest ever but so much fun to see all the big stars way back then. It was entertaining
4,Fantasy Island,Unable to rate quality of video as was given for gift and recipient had not used it yet; overall appearance of video and packaging was good and definitely at a good price.
5,Fantasy Island Has The Best Guest Stars !,"I always loved this show as much for the chance to see the guest stars as anything else. Ricardo Montalban brought class,and they brought sass ! Some particular favorites in the two pilot movies and the first season are Sandra Dee,Eleanor Parker,Dack Rambo,Carol Lynley,Edd Byrnes,Ken Berry,Vera Miles,George Chakiris,Sheree North,George Maharis,Dennis Cole,John Gavin and many more. You can always count on Fantasy Island to be entertaining."
5,the best tv show,I am totally loving this dvd set and can't wait until the other seasons are released. This is clean and wholesome fun for all. Quite inventive stories and with the trash currently on tv this is quite a refreshing show to watch
5,When TV was good...,My daughter purchased this DVD as a gift from my Wish List & I'm ecstatic! Trying to explain the feel of good tv to my children is impossible but Fantasy Island is a perfect example of my youthful tv experiences! I love it and would highly recommend purchasing this DVD! Best gift I've received from my kids in a long time! :)
4,Fantasy Island,I watched this serie many years ago. I'ts still a very good story. No one has made a copy. Thats good.
5,Deleriously Entertaining,"Ah, the 70's! Every week on Fantasy Island, a pack of has-beens, never-weres, and refugees from flop TV shows would parade through some of the most ridiculous plots this side of that other island - Gilligan's. All this was orchestrated by a Ricardo Montelban who was clearly enjoying himself, as well he might, since he never had it so good. The only unanswered question (aside from whether Montelban's Mr. Roarke was God or the Devil) is when we'll ever get more seasons of this deleriously entertaining show. If names like Bill Bixby, Karen Valentine, and Bert Convy simultaneously make you sigh and snicker, then come to Fantasy Island!"
3,fantasy island,"I have only watched the first two episodes so far, but have noticed that the sound and the picture is off,you see people talking and their lips moving, but don't hear what is said until afterwards, the second episode was better than the first, I'm hoping the other episodes and discs are okay."
4,The Pharaohs arn't so ainchent but there still cool.,I expected to like the radio hits that I've heard before and after listening to the whole disc I'd say that I liked all of the tracks on the disc.
5,the guardian is cool!!!,"this action figure is great! even though he doesn't have very much poseability, but that's ok because they all don't move too good just at the legs and arms. and the new turtle figures are kind of better than the old ones because the new raphael is better than the old raphael i have because his front is softer."
1,cartridge past expiration date,I ordered a pair of cartridges from this site because of $. The B&W cartridge expiration date was visable and due to expire 3 months after purchase. The color cartridge expiration date was covered by a heavy tape. I removed the tape to find that the cartridge expired 1 month ago. I emailed the vendor and did not get a response. Don't know if inkjet cartridges are good past expiration date (suspect they are) but I thought this was pretty deceptive - and didn't appreciate the lack of response
1,It never came in the Mail!,"I ordered this product to show up with my other purchase. It didn't come, I didn't hear anything. When I was about to call I get an e mail saying you will be refunded for this product. Wow I'm really glad I needed this to be here for a camping trip and no one told me it wasn't coming. Would have been really nice to have had time to go out and get a new one."
5,Good items,Arrived quickly and work great. These pouches work great on my beach vacations when I want to take my valuables with me!
5,Good for Six Flags,I wanted to travel light when I went to Six Flags Darien Lake; I bought this to carry my phone and some cash instead of carrying a purse. I took this to the wave pool and it worked wonders. No water reached my phone nor my cash. I would recommend this for anyone who doesn't want to leave their phone unattended during water rides.
4,It works!,"Vacationed in Hawaii and my guidebook suggested getting a waterproof fanny pack for valuables when you go into the water. Got this one instead because there ain't no way I'm gonna wear a fanny pack! Didn't use it for GPS or PDA, though (too scared, just in case it leaks). Instead used it for wallet and car keys. Stayed dry for several uses! I'm a fan."
2,hard closure,the closure on the samll dry pack is not that easy to maneuver..and haven't even performed in while wet..the size is good for a small cell phone but a little tight for a Blackberry or Iphone
1,22pc Countersink Drill Bit Sets W/case,Case arrived broken..all bits seemed melted to the foam pieces inside the case. It was a *bust* all around. Went to Menards and bought my son another set that I could give him as a Christmas gift withOUT shame.
1,Junk,Absolute junk!!!!! The setscrews that hold the collars for screw depth and countersink depth are very difficult to position and keep tight. If you try to get them tight then the heads strip out. And if by some lucky chance you get everything properly tight then you will find out that the countersinks quickly go dull.
2,Get what you pay for it.,"Kinda disappointed in the over all product. The plus side to this was it didnt cost full price ( thats why i gave it 2 stars instead of 1). Late arrival by 2 days, opened the package looked at the drill bits and was a bit scared of them very low quality lots of burrs in the fluting of the bits. The counter sink set up looks to be fair to great quality, the case to it is very cheap as well. My recommendation buy it for the counter sink set up and use your own bits, toss your case you get with it away find some thing new for it and use the bits that come with it to keep your counter sink set together."
2,Not as nice as pictured,"This picture was misleading. It makes it appear as if this comes with a nice carrying case, but actually it's just a raw wood box and the bits don't stay in the slots. They are just laying in cut out slots and fall out when you open the case. The case itself is poorly made and the screws in the latch aren't even attached straight. The screw is going in sideways and raised up. I chose this product because of the convenient case, but that was a mistake."
2,Very disappointed,I ordered this product as a Christmas gift for my brother. The packaging came open and damaged at the top and all of the bits were ill fitted and shifted in the box. I'm going to have to remove the packaging to wrap it because it looks so terrible. Very unhappy with the product. It looks much nicer in the picture.
2,You get what you pay for.,"Although presented in a nice box suitable for long-term storage, don't expect long-term use out of these. Screws will not remain tight and countersink cutter dulls after only limited use (on plywood in my case).They work, after a fashion, but not made for repeated use."
3,bits,"inexpensive set, but seem to go up in smoke in even soft wood. great as a second set for backup."
1,don't make the same mistake,I admit I was too optimistic given the price that this set would be anything but sub-standard. My fault. Don't make the same mistake I did. Man up and spend a little more for a decent product.
1,JUNK,"These bits are absolutely horrible. The only thing decent about them is the cute little box that they come in. The collars and countersinks are impossible to tighten. The supplied allen wrench ""sort of"" fits in some of the set screws, and if you are able to get the wrench in, getting it out is a nightmare. The drill bits themselves have a Very blunt point so positioning them accurately is a challenge and the taper is minimal. I can't remember the last time I encountered something so poorly made."
1,Stupid...useless design,"These are virtually useless. It is impossible to tighten the collars down tightly enough so they actually work. The design is basically flawed. Stick to the Vermont American style if you wish to get any work done, as with these, all you will be working on is these tools. They simply are not worth the aggravation. Trying these was a huge mistake. I suspect I will have to take what I have left, and epoxy the collars to the shafts, just to get them to work at all. No...I am sorry...but they do not even work on soft pine. These are just plain junk!"
1,Save your money and time.,"This ""tool"" was unusable, the hex locks that were supposed to tighten the countersink bit to the drill bit kept coming loose.It was a waste of time."
4,problem solved,I ordered Delta Force Land Warrior from CDROMUSA and received the wrong cd. I followed the steps of contacting the seller thru amazon's email system and the matter was taken care of within two days. They did not even ask that the wrong one be returned before they replaced it or afterwards. I was very pleased with the service and would not have any qualms about buying from them in the future.
3,No English subtitles,I did read your comments that said English subtitles but there is no Enlgish subtitles for deaf people. I know this movie is good but I have a hard time to understand what people said.
1,La Virgen de Guadalupe,Received but did not watch for couple weeks. Big mistake! There was no video on the disc. A blank movie so cannot review.
3,Not very pedagogical,"Typical Thai in its listmania, and unpedagogical approach. For anyone serious about learning Thai I'd recommend to go with a course from Linguaphone and then use this and other Paiboon publications as a supplement for extra vocabulary and example sentences.Plus side is that it is cheap and has a consistent transcription system.It has 10 chapters, each with a list of about 60 new words, 10-30 short example sentences and 3-4 short conversations. In addition there are long lists of names, pronouns, places, ministries, &c;."
3,Typically Thai,"The book starts with a section on Thai place names and has sections on Thai names and food. Why they are in here I do not know other than to practice your Thai reading. They take up valuale space.There is a little grammar follwed by excercises, but I could have done with more grammar. It's typically Thai - half done.This is a follow up book to ""Thai for Elementary Learners"", though how you go from elementary to intermediate in one step I don't know. You don't in learning English.That said it is one of the better books around. But I'd love a good one."
4,"Excellent price, great adapter!","I've tried several different connectors/adapters for connecting laptop computers and personal music players (MP3, etc.) to pro audio systems, and this one worked better than most, a lot cheaper! Thanks, and I'll probably be back for more (I use these everywhere I go!)."
3,Somewhat outdated,"Despite being a new edition, the book is somewhat outdated and many modern concepts or instrumentation descriptions are missing, particularly so for macromolecular crystallography. I bought it largely for completeness of my X-ray literature collection as it is a classic. For rapid overview about general crystallography, the IUCr monograph edited by C. Giacovazzo perhaps is more modern and suitable."
5,Works GREAT Install was a SNAP,My pontoon need a new steering cable. I have never had to replace a steering cable before. This was simple. The design makes it near fool-proof. Works like a charm. Can't wait until the weekend. looking to motor all around the lake.
4,Safe T Steering,"Better than the old Steering cable that it replaced, but design is still prone to lock-up and gearing is insufficient to overcome. I blame the boat designer rather than the steering cable designer for the difficulty of installation.Product was delivered promptly. No prblem with vendor."
4,nice,"The steering system went on a new build. It was pretty straight forward with templates to help cut out holes. Went in pretty quick, had it all done in about an hour. no feedback. thats nice."
5,Gut Bustingly Hilariousity!,"I don't read much, but after growing up in South Carolina and visiting Florida many times, I found this book to be quite hilarious. Unless you are a jackass, you will love this book. My wife is a teacher and this stuff happens to her all the time (except her students are even wilder-like from animal house or something-except in high school).High recommended!"
1,Potentially dangerous,"I am not reviewing the bee teether that vibrates, though it might have the same problem. Please be careful when allowing your baby to use this teether if they already have developed some teeth. My 10 month old has been using this teether a lot recently. She already has four upper and lower teeth, but her molars are now coming in. My husband noticed the other day that she had almost completely chewed through and off some of the bumps on the upper wing. She could have potentially choked or swallowed the pieces. I have an e-mail into Sassy and I'm waiting a response. Please use this teether with caution."
5,classic masterpiece,"I love this album. Great jazzy production that isn't too soft. Perfect flows to complement the beats. Very complete and well put-together with highlights including ""Mixtapes"" (and its remix), ""On The Road"" and ""Bus Stops"""
5,WEST COAST MASTERPIECE,CLASSICLYRICS --------- 9/10PRODUCTION COURTESY OF THE NONCE ---------- 10/10THEME --------- 10/10ALBUM COVER ---------- 8/10CONCEPT ---------- 10/10STANDOUT TRACKS ---------- ALL TRACKSOVERALL ----------- PURE HIP HOP NON STOP.
4,World Ultimate,"It was a beautiful time in hip-hop and The Nonce did their part in encapsulating some of the West Coast's varied perspectives at that time. Some of the most beautiful, fun and thumping beats that many hip-hop students will tell you are purely classic are on this album. The summer jam ""Bus Stops"" got non-stop burn as it's ode to the wandering honeys. They played around alot with old school rhythms and things, but there was an infusion of that California-based Blowdian feel to the whole project which made it unique and brought you into the world of The Nonce. 'J to th I' is by far one of my favorite joints of all time, and 'Mix Tapes' had every head that came across it nodding without choice. For those of you who want a really in-depth look into West Coast Underground without being boxed into The Pharcyde and Freestyle Fellowship, definetely check out these guys. It's good music and respectable MC'ing going on. RIP Yusef Afloat!!-SumKid, The Vinyl Junkie Clique"
3,Dishing the Dictionary,"Easy to read, but definitions are very brief, and many words are excluded.Claudiacougar, Texas <USA"
3,Improperly listed,"PLEASE CHANGE THE LISTING - these are NOT narrow crown staples - they're T50 standard width. Narrow crown are approximately 1/4"" wide, these are not..."
4,Good introduction to Pastoral Care,"This book is an excellent introduction for those embarking on Clinical Pastoral Education. It is written from a Christian perspective, but is sufficiently ecumenical to be useful to those of other religions."
5,Excellent for Church pastoral care as well as CPE students,This is a one of a kind pastoral care book which is focused on what someone needs to know beginning their practice as well as for those who need to review. I have used it with Clinical Pastoral Education students who give it high marks as well as with a Church lay pastoral group. Worth considering for a personal library and professional review.
3,Informative & spirit driven,Guide book for new pastors with information on representing God through actions and speech. By using examples and descriptions the author shares his wisdom.
4,"Safely Home, a Fiction novel","I downloaded this book because it was on the top selling free books. It was a good book. At times it was a bit slow, but other times is was so intense I teared up a bit. After finishing this book, I decided to look at the reviews. I noticed that people took this book as reality whereas it is truly a work of fiction. I am not religious but I understand people need to put their faith in something. As a fiction book, it was good. For those who were complaining that it wasn't realistic and that China is not like that, chill out. It states right on the page that the book is fiction. Overall I would recommend this, it's a great story with great insight."
5,Wow,"I love Randy Alcorns books, but this one was different, but just as good. It really opened my eyes to some things that I guess a lot of try not to think about. Amazing!It's an eye opening book that I could not put down."
5,A powerful book on many levels.,"There are very few authors that I would send the extra money on for a hardback. Randy Alcorn is one of them. Ever since reading his book ""Deadline"", I have been hooked. Randy weaves tales that draw you in and involve you. This is book you won't want to rush through -- take the time to savor each page.""Safely Home"" is a powerful book on many levels. At times it will make you very uncomfortable. At times it will bring tears to your eyes. At times you will laugh at Ben Fielding then realized that you are him. It really made me stop and re-evaluate where I am at in my walk and what I am doing to feed and pray for others. Needless to say, I know what my family and friends are getting for Christmas this year."
5,Amazing book to show the power of the martyr,"This book was reccommended to me by a friend and I decided to try it. Little did I know how much it would affect me. It takes actual accounts from missionaries around the world, combines them with accounts from the early church of Acts, and creates a fictional story with very real situations. Despite being fictional characters, the testimonies are powerful and I couldn't help but be moved by the way Christians in other parts of the world are sacrificing so much for the cause of Christ. I highly reccommend this book to anyone who wants an exciting read that at times may move you to tears."
1,Why bother?,"""Christian"" fiction is a hoot! If you enjoy this tripe go for it. Otherwise it is like getting bored to death by a bunch of missionairies."
1,Preachy!,"Wow. I downloaded this because it was the highest-reviewed free book available, but it was preachy, mediocre, and homophobic. I guess I got what I paid for."
1,Safely Home,"My wife is the Church Librarian and this purchase was for the library. It has not yet been checked out by any of our church members at this time. Therefore, it is not possiboe to review Safely Home at this date. As usual though, I am always pleased with the service we get when ordering from Amazon."
2,Ummmmmmmmmm,"Everyone who has read this book completly raves about it. But I see differently. The way the author writes this book makes it look like all God cares about is those who suffer and are Martrys. I don't mean to sound selfish, but it was pretty lame."
5,A Beautiful Story,"This book moved me so incredibly the first time I read it, that I immediately re-read it - which is something I don't remember ever having done before. The reverence and love that the characters have for the Word (Shengjing) and the faith they showed in adversity and hardship amazed me. I want to worship like that. I want to read God's Word and treasure every verse. The book really made me consider what beauty and truth that I have in my life, always right at my fingertips, yet I very often (usually) take it for granted. A beautifully, written story."
5,My Favorite Book Other Than the Bible!,"I say this with all sincerity--this is my favorite fictional work (though undeniably based on many true events which have transpired in recent decades, in persecuted nations) of all time! I loved it so much that I even named my son after one of its characters (the angel Jadorel). Safely Home is right up there with Pilgrim's Progress, and a ""must read"" for all committed Christians who are living for another homeland (Heaven). It's also great for lukewarm believers who need an exhortative kick in the pants (like me at the time that I read it). Well done, Randy."
5,The Best Book I've read in a Long Time!!,"This book is the greatest book I have read! It really makes you think about your life and what you take as an advantage! There were many times when I was brought to tears because of how great Li Quan's (the main character) faith was, it was incredible! I can guarantee that after you read this book, the next time you're rushing to get ready for church on Sunday, you will think about the Chinese and the way they go to church, and when you toss your Bible on the kitchen counter, you'll think of the Chinese who don't have any Bibles! Overall, it reminds you how great the Lord is, how faithful He is, and how great your reward will be when you enter into His house!James 1:12: Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him."
5,10 stars,Oh my goodness! This is the only book I have wanted to read twice. I must have 10 friends reading it right now. It provoked in me (a non-emotional type) to cry several times and moved me to evaluate my own life. This author MUST be brilliant and inspired to have written such a piece. I plan to have a book discussion in the manor of their secret meetings in China and PRAY for persecuted Christians. The ONLY bad thing about this book is that after it - all others books pale.
4,A Story to Make You Think,This was an interesting read. The book follows Ben and Quan former roommates who have taken different paths in life. Ben has put his faith off to the side while Quan's faith life has been active in China. When the two meet Ben slowly begins to consider what's really important.I think that this book does a good job of describing what types of persecution Christians in other parts of the world go through. The plot of the book is interesting and I think fairly believable. I enjoyed reading it.
4,It was very inlightning. A good thing to know.,"I did not finish, as my Chinese friend wanted to read it on their trip, so i'll finish it later."
5,Captivating,"Safely home is a captivating book. It makes one face the reality that Christian are persecuted for their faith all over the world. Within the context of this novel we are presented with the choices we must make every day concerning our beleifs as well as challenging the reader to consider what they would give up to defend there values.This story made me laugh, cry, and above all remember that I too, must be willing to sacrifice for what I believe in. This is a novel sure to keep you on edge until the end."
5,Safely Home,"THIS BOOK IS TRULY REMARKABLE. IT LITERALLY TOOK ME TO MY KNEES FRESH AT THE CROSS. IT IS HARD FOR WESTERNER'S TO PERCEIVE HOW PRECIOUS THE WORD OF GOD IS TO THESE PEOPLE AND HOW THEY WILL GO TO ANY EXTREME TO GET EVEN ONE PAGE OF IT.THIS SHOULD TRULY BE READ WITH ""THE HEAVENLY MAN"" IT WILL OPEN YOUR EYES TO MANY THINGS WE ARE NOT AWARE OF HERE IN THE U.S. IT DOES HELP TO HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE BIBLE, BUT I LOVE THE SLANT THAT RANDY HAS WRITTEN IT FROM. A ""MUST READ"" BOOK FOR ANY BELIEVER IN GOD."
5,I read it 4 times,"BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!! I've read Safely Home four times in the last 3 months. I would finish it and put it away but after a few days pick it up and start over. Every time I read this book, I find new insight and renew growth in my faith. Mr. Alcorn has woven a stirring story that highlights the difference between a country with free religion and one with very limited freedoms."
3,fair,It was worn more than I expected and I purchased for a friend to read.It will serve the purpose.
5,This book helped me when I didn't know that I would need it,"My mother recommended this book to me. At first, I thought that it was going to be boring. Far from it. After looking at the inside jacket of the book and seeing the picture, it all made sense. We are all trying to get safely home to our FATHER! This book prepared me for my grandmother's transition from here to her real home. Thank you Randy Alcorn for writing this book. It also showed me how I take some things for granted. I have quite a few bibles and there are people who are not allowed to have one. Gives you something to think about."
4,"Love the story and messages, but, Kindle formatting off.","I have read ""Safely Home"" twice. I liked it the first time. I loved it the second time. Truly a glimpse into the persecution of Christians in China. Makes you thankful to be able to freely choose to go to church in the USA and even to own a Bible. I learned about the Chinese house church and the Chinese culture. I appreciated reading about Chinese history and culture, persecution based on religion, human rights, suffering for your faith. I enjoyed seeing how God brought two people together, took them separate ways, and brought them back together for His glory.I gave the book 4 stars ONLY because the Kindle formatting was off so much it distracted me from the book. Punctuation missing, crazy spacing, etc. Could use some proofreading.The story deserves 5-stars! Worth reading no matter how you get it!"
5,Heart-wrenching,"To me, this book wasn't as eye-opening, since I've read memoirs about persecuted Chinese Christians, but because I did so, I can confirm this book is very accurate. To others, however, it may be very eye-opening, and I hope you read it, if you have not already. This is a book any and every Christian ought to read. Even non-believers may find it breaking down their arguments and feeling pity. It is a story of two worlds. America and China, and also Heaven and Earth. (I am not indicating similarities between them) Because of this book, my heart goes out to China."
5,Life Changing,"I read this book on Kindle and did the preview thing, so I knew what I wasbuying. Even so, this book packed a punch. I am a Christian but for many reasons had stopped church going. I read this book, I will be looking for a church home now and thanking God for the freedom to do so.I read praying it was just a story, unfortunately it is based on fact. Christians are persecuted in many parts of the world. There are many additions to my prayer lists now.The story, writing, main characters a pacing are top notch too. I also love the glimpses of Heaven. Of course no one can really know what it will be like, but I think the author has great insight into what will probably be there.I think anyone who wants to know more than the Olympic sanitized version of China would learn from and enjoy this book. It is comforting to think that Capitalism brings freedom, but there is no proof for this supposition."
1,I could not read to the end,"A family with cell phone and an Internet connected computer making hand written copies of the Bible does not sound real, does it? The book is a patchwork of facts (not so new) and fiction, mixed with pentecostal ideas. Not the kind of reading I enjoy, even being a Christian. It seems the author tries to insert a 70's and 80's persecution picture in today's scenario. Being a Brazilian I can tell a foreigner author usually misses the point when he tries to explain a different culture environment (old American movies always pictured Brazilians wearing those large Mexican hats you would never find anywhere in Brazil). It seems the book describes what most Christians would like to read about China. Put together persecution, angels and spirits and you have a bestseller for those who enjoy this kind of books."
3,"Good for its message, not that well-written","This novel didn't make me want to never put it down, but I did appreciate the message behind it. There were a couple of really good, powerful scenes. Overall I thought it was worth reading, but maybe check it out from the library."
1,Not satisfactory,"While the message of ""Safely Home"" is important, the book largely failed to resonate with me. The writing is just plain poor, with flat, stereotypical characters; a plodding, cliched, predictable plot; and long passages of dull sermonizing as the author preaches to the choir. (Mild spoilers?...) The frequent shift to the POV of characters watching the events from heaven was hugely ham-fisted, irritating, and (especially towards the end) a bit blasphemous as the author takes it upon himself to think God's thoughts for him. I think it's a shame we let ourselves be content with poor writing such as this simply because it's ""Christian"". I continue to be underwhelmed by modern Christian fiction."
2,Safely Home,This fascinating story appears to be poorly bound: two books split! Mine split the first time I opened the book.
5,Relevant to our American lives!,I truly enjoyed this book. It made me realize how I take our access to the Bible and freedoms for granted.Do yourself a favor and read this one!
5,Safely Home,you will not be able to put this book down without an argument with yourself! everyone should read this book.
1,I did not receive this item.,I was looking forward to receiving this item. The thought of being able to protect my screen was comforting so you can understand how I felt when it failed to arrive. That is the ONLY reason I rated it so low.
1,lacking instructions,"Good 'idea book' for a beginner. Projects are simple and basic...low quality miniatures done well. If you are an intermediately skilled or experienced miniaturist, this book is not for you. The projects are easy enough, most are made with paper, buttons and beads. Over half the projects are made with polymer clay, which is fine, but the instructions for all clay projects are poor, i.e. ""make from polymer clay"". Projects are all for decorative accessories, if you're looking for furniture instructions, look elsewhere."
1,Not worth it,This video made me laugh. Pilates is not Yoga. This 20 min workout did not make me sweat. (that to me is a good workout). It seemed to me 2 ladies set up a video camera in the living room and over dubbed the vocals. I was very disappointed.
5,One of the Best Books I have ever read.,"It shows how the Hork-Bajir were created,the people that created them and how they were transformed into controllers."
5,Way cool!,"There's a Hork Bajir who's really nice. He meets an andalite princess, daughter of the infamous Seerow. They work together. Then they meet a yeerk who wants to take over the world!"
5,I can't wait to read it!,"I think that this should be a great book because all of K.A.'s other books have been. I wonder if they show a full picture of a Hork Bajir? And a female Andalite, that's odd.My biggest question is: how do the Yeerks advance when the Hork Bajir bodies are so fierce? I mean, when they put them into the Yeerk pool, they're going to put up quite a fight. Who's going to do it, a Gedd? I don't think so. I would recommend this book to anyone because they're all so good."
4,Very Interesting,"Dak Hamee, born into the Hork-Bajir tribe, is something special from the start. ""Strange,"" says his mother. ""A seer,"" says the Old One, Tila Fashat. ""A seer is one who is born to show a new way. Many, many seasons pass, then our father, the Deep, and our mother, the Sky, say, 'Send a seer to the people. The people have need.' And so one is born who is different."" When strange and different Dak meets Aldrea, the clever Andalite daughter of Prince Seerow, they learn together of the dangerous plot of the Yeerks, and of Esplin 9466, who will stop at nothing to build his empire. Learn more about Prince Seerow's Kindness, find out how Andalites kiss, and plumb the mysteries of the Deep in this suspense-filled story of good, evil, and interspecies love. (Ages 9 to 12)"
4,Aliens are Coming,"This is a really great book called The Hork-Bajir Chronicles.If you like Animorphs you'll like this book. It is the story of Dak Hamee (a Hork-Bajir),Aldrea(an andilite), Esplin 9466(a Yeerk who later becomes Visser Three).lThis book switches around between the characters.The story is about Dak and Aldrea on a mission to save the Hork-Bajir home world from the Yeerks.During this story they discover many secrets and perils,like when they discover the Arn.If you want to know the begining, before the animorphs read this book..."
5,AWSOME!!!!!!,"I thought this book was increadible!!! It is the best book in the world! Aldrea looked more real on the cover of the book, than the andalites on the show.I can't wait till the next book comes out.It looked realeay real.I wish i could see the inside of the Animorphs calender!!!!!"
4,The book was great!,"This was a great Animorph book. It was full of discription and it had action, romance etc. It was not very long though. If it was longer it would be a whole lot better."
4,Interesting Book,"The great part about this book is hhow Miss Applegate creates three main characters and one by one shows each of their points of view. One from an Andilite, who is visiting with her partents to the planet. Another a Hork-Bajir seer, named Dak Hamee, who will one day lead his people to something he has yet to find out. And the last, a Yeerk named Esplin 9466, who is trying to invade the Hork-Bajir homeworld. I would recomend this book to young to teen readers who enjoy Sci-fi-ish books and who won't mind the switch of different main characters. I myself happen to like the Chronical books, I think they are more interesting than the short Animorphs chapter books. It would be nice if K.A. Applegate made the book a bit longer, just to see what happened after the Yeerks made the invasion."
4,Good but it stoped in the Middie,I loved the Animorphs. The Hork Bajar Chronicles was the story or how the hork bajar became slaves of the yeerks. It also tells how the yeerk empire and morphing technology got started. Action sadness and suspense. Ok I didn't understand how the Jubba Jubba got defeated and I hated the ending. It stoped in the middle. It had no ending. What a scam. Endings like that should be against the law.
4,"Stiller's Incisive, Insidious Satire on Hollywood Naricissism","This is not merely a celebratory satire of 70's and 80's Vietnam films but probably the most subversive, scathing and joyous indictment of Hollywood celebrity narcissism and the exploitation of racial and disability issues. The allusions to ""Missing In Action"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are brilliant."
2,Downey Only Saving Grace in Failed Satire,"Oscar-nominated Robert Downey Jr. adds new meaning to ""method actor"" with his brilliant turn in ""Tropic Thunder."" Unfortunately, Downey's inspired performance remains the sole redeeming feature of this disastrous Hollywood satire. Despite a promising start with its faux trailers, ""Tropic Thunder"" goes downhill quickly. There's nothing wrong with over-the-top humor, but director Ben Stiller draws few chuckles from his ""Three Stooges Meet Apocalypse Now"" premise. As film comedians, Stiller and Jack Black are painfully unfunny - easily trumped by Tom Cruise's amusing cameo appearance. Even ""Apocalypse Now"" has more intentional laughs than this big-budget misfire."
1,Poor voice recorder,"I bought this mainly to record lectures, but the recording is hardly audible even though I was only ten feet away from the lecturer. Also, the manual is written in such horrible english that I couldn't even figure out how to get back to the main menu. It seems to work well as a cheap 1gb flash drive though."
3,Acceptable replacement,"I bought the rotary steering as a replacement for an old Teleflex rack and pinion system that went bad. The rotary system has more resistance in the cable and drum and is called ""no feedback"" because of this increased resistance. You will not feel the motor twisting against your hand like the rack and pinion system did ... the down side is ... it is stiffer to turn and ... there is no feedback from the motor. With the rotary NFB system, you will no longer be able to grab the motor and turn it and the steering system if you want to adjust or straighten the motor while it is sitting on the trailer at home.The standard steering wheel for this system is 13"" instead of the 14"" size Teleflex used on the rack and pinion set ups. With the increased resistance, I wish I had looked around for a 14"" instead of using the standard 13"" wheel. You will probably pay more, but it will be easier to use."
1,No custormer service,"Package was damaged upon delivery, no communication with the vendor on how to send back and get a new product. Disputed with credit card company. I will not pay for a damaged product! Bummer."
5,One of the best TOS Pocket novels,"This is the first Pocket novel I read as a kid, and when I saw it available on Kindle it was a must-download.I'm pleased to say that the book is as good as I remember it. The other reviews sum it up well... the most I can say is that, more so than any other Trek novel, I can easily visualize this as an episode of TOS, with only a few fancy starship moves holding it back from realistically being filmed.The story is a classic morality play, and the author understands the characters enough such that everyone gets a spotlight.As one who read the original printing, the Kindle edition does have a few formatting problems, but they are not enough to deprive you of a fine Trek adventure that deserves a spot right up there with Spock's World, Imzadi and the other classics."
4,Binoculars,I don't know anything about how strong to order binoculars and these could have been a little bit stronger but they are really nice - good quality and we're happy with them.......just wish we could see farther away. That's my fault though.
1,Thought She Was The Vocalist,"I purchased this CD thinking that Valerie Krystal was the lead singer of this group. It does use the word ""Featuring"" on the cover. As I started to listen, I thought this was a Village People CD with the wrong cover art. If Valerie was not going to sing, it should have said Featuring Valerie Krystal on drums, keyboards, bells or something. If someone has this CD and Valerie DID sing I am wrong. However, if she did sing I sure couldn't tell her from one of the boys."
5,A Fathers Grieves,I found 400 Hours to be an extremely poignant and gut wrenching story.The authors pain was horrific.I came away feeling that I knew the entire family and had somehow gone through the entire grieving process with them.It's all there.The author made it easy to read by weaving in and out of the various family members and how they each came to grips with the loss of Hollie.I highly recommend this book.
2,You get what you pay for,"These aren't the best cheap speakers on the market. The sound tinny and far away even when are you at your computer. If you need a cheap set of throwaway speakers, these are for you, otherwise Logitech makes some speakers that cost a bit more ~$25, but sound fantastic. I upgraded to those and gave these to goodwill."
2,Definetly Different,"The author takes a psychological approach to explaining secret societies. However, he does this in a very rambling, disjointed and highly unconventional way. Don't get me wrong, convention is not always good, but by the time I was 1/4 the way through this book I was longing for some convention. It's not hard to see why the author has self-published. The book needs an editor for many reasons, only one of which is the highly disjointed fashion in which the author takes on the purported subject.When I listen to John Rappaport on the radio I listen with great interest and I always leave the show fealing better informed. However, I cannot say I was better informed by reading his book. There are many, many better books on this subject to choose from and unless money flows into your bank account try another author."
5,Refreshingly original approach to liberation,"Many of us tend to seek solace in someone else's inventions, ready-made systems that money can buy. But to Rappoport, liberation lies in the very act of creating. The individual's intent and action to imagine and create on one's own is the best antidote to any system conjured up by any secret societies, be them medical, energy or media cartel.To me, that message was something I had never heard before. Very refreshing and inspiring stuff, to say the least."
4,painting your way out of a narrow canvas...,"If the so-called ""elite"" had ""power animals"" I'm sure the predominate one would be the female mosquito...or like one of the ""big-boys"" quoted in the book says, ""a deadly virus."" Hey...come to think of it...maybe these guys ARE power animals...they are certainly predatory...Anyway, if you've made it here, you probably have read some of the other books talking about the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, the boy's pirate club (322), etc. Are you depressed yet? If you are...and if your head is spinning with stories of major ebony magics...this book might be the thing for you! Why? Well...despite how bad things seem...Rappoport reminds us that it is just really really bad performance art (effective...but BAD), and we can change the performance via GOOD ART!!Yeah...sure the book wanders around a bit...but it's all there to give you some in the head images concerning the way things could be..."
4,re the wild and wyked world of brian jones,i enjoyed the romance part of it and hope it is true. but not sure if the real Brian could fall for one girl. but it was very romantic and then of course saddebbi
4,Cute but way too overpriced!!! (...),"I really want to buy this tub for my B.B doll but it is so expensive!!! I mean for what it does that's pretty good but I think you guys should permanently keep the price (...). The bath itself looks amazing and does cool things like the shower actually showers and it looks like the faucet pours water too. This is guaranteed to make any plastic bodied doll you have happy and clean!! I bet it'd be great for a Waterbaby too. If you have the money and don't have the doll, buy this and Baby Born!! You'll be very glad you did."
5,BEST TOY EVER,Santa got this for my little girl on Christmas and she also got the limited edition baby born. We have yet to make her cry but she absolutely loves giving her a bath in her baby born bath tub with a real working shower! It is so much fun for her. This was definately a hit!
3,Name of the song during the endtitles...,"...the very cool song playing during the endtitles of ""Darkness Falls"" is called ""Gunboat"" by the group Vixtrola. You can hear an audio stream of it on their website (www.vixtrola.com); I found this info on the Internet Movie Database (www.imdb.com). Hope this helps! :)"
4,Brian who?,"Having purchased the soundtrack to Darkness Falls simply to make amends for my missing the movie in theaters, I was hoping at least for a mediocre selection that would satisfy my appetite until the DVD was released... there had to be something in 26 tracks... surprise surprise...I've never heard of Tyler, but now that I have this CD, I'll be paying attention when he pops up in more films. The first track on this CD was enough for me to listen carefully, and the rest is just a thrilling treat for the ears. The variety is just outstanding, with rushes of adrenaline-charged cues flaring up between more thoughtful, somber pieces. There are even playful elements which tickle the fancy for a brief moment before hell breaks loose again...The composer skirts the edges of Horner and Goldsmith, almost colliding with the main title of Hollow Man, but in all this is one CD that's worth a listen..."
2,Darkness Falls Sountrack,"Vixtola's Gunboat is intoxicating, but where to find it? Evidently their album is indefinitely on hold for whatever reason. However...http://www.geocities.com/simunovici/rock.htm"
4,Great product....,"We are not using this product for anything other than a pollen product, and after several uses it has done pretty well. It does what it says it will do, and is a little ""bit"" of an expensive solution for a small problem, and wish it would last in the pool a little longer. But once again, we didn't use this for anything but pollen, so it's affect on algae or other pollens that aren't as rapid as ours may last. As with most Natural Chemistry products, the conditioning is fantastic, and really give the water a great silky feel. if you haven't used this or pool perfect, you should give it a shot!"
5,"So far, so good....","I wasted a lot of money on other products trying to clear my pool since it was opened back in May. So far, this is the only product that is clearing the pool to the point where we can see the bottom now! We were thinking about draining most of the water out and starting fresh but we don't have to do that now."
5,Great,"A can of tiki oil fell into my pool and someone recommended this product to remove it. I poured it in the pool and a few hours later, there was NO sign of any oil ever spilling in the pool, and the water had a very crispy clear look, they way it looks when the pool cleaner guy comes out!"
5,"Best product ever for clean, clear water!","This product is fantastic for almost over night clean up for cloudy water. It also leaves an almost ""silky"" feel to the water. It is well worth the money!"
4,My daycare children love this book,I was so happy to find a book that teaches how to do different string games. I never knew there were so many! It made it so much easier to have this book come with its own string. The children that have used this book vary in ages from 5 to 11. It was great to see the older children reading to the younger children and practicing it together. I have to admit I enjoyed doing this with my class.
5,Epic,"This is the kind of story that i would expect from hollywood thrilling, daring, dangerous, terrible odds, the evil enemy and success but unlike hollywood its true. A story about freedom fighters captured, imprisoned and the epic rescue they were part of. This is the kind of story that inspires."
1,Confusing,"I purchased this book, because it was recommended as a Family Read Aloud for the Ancient History Program that I am using this year with my daughters. We are also reading Genesis right now. It was confusing to them and to me to try to explain to them what parts of the book are true, and what parts are the authors imagination. I did not like how Biblical Truth about God was mixed in with interpretation and complete myths. If you are looking for a good read aloud I would not recommend this book. We read the first 8 chapters, because I keep saying maybe it will get better, but it didn't. I am now using this book as an example to my girls that it is okay to stop reading something that isn't true and is confusing you about the real Truth the Bible!"
3,Good read second time,I was a little to quick to review this book the first time. After reading a few more historical fiction and biblical fiction books. I enjoyed this one more the second time around. My kids are understanding it better after reading the creation account through to the tower of babel in the bible first.
1,God's Word Twisted,"God punished the children of Israel when they mixed pagan religion with true worship of God. I know this book is not a translation of the Bible, but it takes God's word and adds so much ""data"" that is outside of the Bible that God's word is twisted to fit the author's own imagination. Deuteronomy 4:2 says, ""Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you."" This book is NOT good reading for anyone, let alone children who are still being taught in school. The world is full of false beliefs concerning what the Bible teaches. We don't need any more."
1,Not a history book,"The main problem with this book is that it purports to be a history book, but it is not. It is a work of fiction. Children interested in ancient history can learn absolutely nothing form this book. It is claimed that author has used sources such as linguistics, archeology, astronomy and other sciences to write the book. In the appendix some sources are listed, most of them about 100 years old. She even quotes an astronomy book by Immanuel Velikovsky!! This is called pseudo-science. And what about this: ""Dragons never stopped growing, and occasionally one reached monstrous size and terrorized a whole town. "" And this is supposed to be history? Parents should be warned against giving their children this book."
1,Christian mythology,"There is just not reconciling christian mythology with actual history and more than there is with any other mythology. Sure you could chart a rudimentary map of Dionysus's travels through Persia, but that doesn't make it historical fact. Its all based on fantasy. Just like christian mythology."
1,I do NOT recommend this book for Bible-believing Christians.,"After hearing all the rave reviews when this book first came out, I purchased it and began reading it to my children. There were inaccuracies pretty early on in the book that continued. I found myself (often) telling my children, ""We don't don't believe this,"" or ""The Bible actually says..."" After a few chapters I thought, ""Why in the world am I reading this to my children if we don't believe much of what's being said?""So, I got rid of the book! If you choose to purchase it, please pre-read it and compare the stories with the Bible account. Then you can make an informed decision."
1,TV in a box,"I thought the series would detail the National Parks listed. It seems like the series is a collection of past National Geographic television episodes slapped together. The ""Hidden Yosemite"" highlighted a climb up El Capitain-hardly a hidden feature of the park. The Hawaii episode was even lamer. I had purchased it as a gift and was very disappointed. Photography remains good."
1,Not very hidden message,"This set is not what you think it's going to be. You'd think it was going to show each of the highlighted parks and show what makes each park unique; flora, fauna, natural formations, beautiful scenery. Instead this series hits relentlessly up side the head with dire predictions about global warming and the horrible consequences of civilization. Not once, but many times. In the Death Valley disc, they mention global warming 12 times in one hour.The message even flies in the face of science. They talk about how parks have changed with it's habitat being constantly threatened by the hand of man and state quite clearly that the natural denizens will be unable to adapt to the changes when species adaptation is a well-founded scientific principle.So if you're looking for wonderful travelogues showcasing our national parks, keep looking.This was a great disappointment at many levels."
2,Don't Expect Much,"As a previous reviewer of this DVD set noted, these five ""National Parks"" programs were produced for television. As such, they're skewed toward sensationalism and lots of ""gloom-and-doom."" It's the gloom-and-doom that's tedious to watch, albeit there is some truth in it. Actually, the rock climber's three-day ascent of El Capitan on the Yosemite disc is quite impressive. The Yellowstone and Death Valley discs have their moments, whilst the Everglades and Hawaii programs put me to sleep. I've watched a half dozen DVD productions on America's national parks (including Ken Burns). The two best in my opinion are ""Treasures of America's National Parks"" (Questar Entertainment), and ""Great Lodges of the National Parks"" ([...])."
2,Very poor representation of the Parks,I have visited these parks several times over the last 40 years and was very disapointed in these dvd's. I returned them for credit.
4,Great gift for parents,This is a great series and a nice peek into our Naitonal parks. Great for my aging parents who will likely not be able to visit them all.
4,Great scenes,"Not on par with BBC series, but well done and definitely worth the time to watch. Greatly enjoyed the series."
1,Nat Geographic Fails,"This set of 7 DVD's IS a Very Disappointing Collection.A very ODDBALL Media player for Windows XP SP3 Operating System Keeps trying to install; That fails & gives a vague error message about a 'Direct-X' ""problem"" .The web site for the FLAWED cd/media reader help is DOWN___Surprise Surprise !!!!!!!Only the Map feature will play correctly.I HAVE the CURRENT Microsoft Software & updates!The Nat Geo Store has cancelled production of the 7 dvd set & now offers a 10 dvd set for National Parks.The Nat Geo CHOICE of OUTSOURCE Software in this case is a TOTAL FAILURE !!!!!"
3,Aceyalone + RJD2,"Aceyalone has let me down a lot recently in terms of releases. He hasn't had a consistently good album for quite awhile.I loved him about ten years ago, but he's slowly slipped since. Given that, I only picked ""Magnificent City"" because it was produced by RJD2. RJD2's beats are pretty good throughout this album, as you would expect.Aceyalone seems to have aged a bit and isn't quite as on-point as he used to be. There are some really stellar songs on here, but then there are some so-so songs. It's about 50-50 in terms of good vs. average.For example, the album starts out really strong with the first two songs, but then drops at the next two songs. So I found it inconsistent.""Magnificent City"" could have easily been a 5-star classic, but it came up a little short. 3.5 stars."
4,standard release by hip hop greats.....,"I think that this album is great in some ways, and yet falls short in others. Ace and RJ are amazing artists in their own rights, and together on an album they shine bright. But what falls short is sometimes songs get repetitive. Mostly the lyrics and sometimes the beats. The hooks range from somewhat tight to just plain annoying. This is a sort of solid release that everyone should check out because it is tight, but don't expect anything groundbreaking. Most of the songs have a commercial feel to them, as I am not an Ace fan I do not have a grasp of what his other albums sound like. I am a huge fan of RJ and these beats on this album are tight, but don't really compare to his solo stuff or Soul Position."
4,The Essential but without references.,"Is great to have all essentials in one volume that covers almost all the basics you need to know in that respect. But the cons are that it doesn't appear any reference at all. No authors, no text, no nothing. So if you need more information in a more deep level, you do not know where the information you are reading come from, from wich articles or investigation. So it doesnt work well as a study guide."
1,Not Helpful,"This study guide is really a mini-textbook without an index. It's small enough to omit lots of info you may need, and without an index you can't easily pick out what might be useful. So it's not very helpful.Rather than buy it, get a copy of Gormly & Brodzinsky's LIFESPAN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. It's a textbook that is clearly written. My copy is from 1989, so it is dated. But I find it helpful when my lecture notes are cryptic, or when the assigned text starts sagging from the weight of its academic verbiage."
3,As advertised,"Items arrived within the specified delivery time. Items were as advertised. Used the pliers to attach a few nock stops with no problem. If you want to spend a little more, a one-piece square would be worth it. (If the ruler doesn't have a joint, there is no chance that it will be out-of-square when you unfold it.)"
3,"Not bad for the price, but not great","The folding square tool for setting nock height worked just fine, i didn't run into any issues because of the hinge. The nocks themselves are fine and the pliers feel well constructed. The problem i found was that, when crimping the nock on the string, the pliers cut very sharp grooves in the metal band. The nocks are soft metal, and during the crimping process, the interior shape of the pliers causes the nock to be pinched where it meets the hinged portion of the pliers. This creates a vertical ""cut"" in the metal that's quite sharp. I suppose it could have been user error, but I feel fairly competent to use a set of pliers. I can imagine shooting this with bare fingers could be painful depending on how the nock - and corresponding edge - is aligned to your grip. If you really need to nock your own string this kit will work, but take extra care when using the pliers to help minimize the groove you'll cut into the nock."
4,Bow-stuff,The bow tuning kit was easy to use and all the tools and parts were of good quality. I was very well pleased with my purchase.
1,Sorry to Offend Anybody,"I apologize if, by writing this customer review, I am insulting anyone who played a role in creating this series or anyone who enjoys it. As a fan of ""Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius,"" the series from which this cartoon was spun off, I figured I would enjoy ""Planet Sheen,"" too, since I always thought that Sheen was one of the funniest characters. However, things just are not the same. The main protagonist is oblivious to the obvious, and the humor can grow annoying. It can become irritating."
1,motherboard,The motherboard arrived defective and I am still waiting for response from the seller regarding a replacement. The seller is not responsive at all.
4,Too Bad for Hell...Too Much Fun,"My daughter got this DVD for a Christmas present and it has been heavily played by every member of our family since. If you even remotely like the Rejects you are going to want to check out the DVD.It has songs from their first CD. Nothing from the CD Move Along will be on this DVD. There are videos on it, there is concert footage, and there is footage of the guys hanging around their hometown of Stillwater, OK.It is a DVD I let my 8 year old watch so, for the most part, it is an all ages DVD. Minor use of swear words."
5,Read this book!,"I am not the typical book reader you usually see in this site. I seldom read, because I get easily distracted and bored. Yet this book was great. Now I want to read more books on Western Colorado hoping to find other stories as interesting as this was."
5,What a Woman!,All women everywhere should read this book about a truly amazing & courageous woman. Ida is a lady that all women can admire & appreciate. I didn't want this book to end. You won't be disappointed in this beautiful book.
4,Oak Baby,"Reynolds pits good against evil in a manner that keeps the reader guessing. Mayport has long had its share of dark secrets, the author is to be complimented for utilizing his vivid imagination to illustrate life in this violent and mysterious community. Each character came alive with every page."
4,very nice album,"song # 3 is the one that made me listen to the rest of them. The singer was a little hard to get used to, and the album didnt stick with me the first couple listenings, but after the 3-4 times of spining it, Id say I like it alot. Its dark, gothic, sounds evil, my only beef is still the singer, He could be better. If you like hardcore death, gothic, blackmetal, this ones for you. I listen to it all the time. If you like a little bit of this type of music, you may not like them at all. You will either love it or hate it."
1,"If you like the smell of pot, maybe...","I'm really not sure what I expected with these ""herbal"" cigarettes, but whatever it was, it certainly wasn't what I ended up getting. I did expect them to be different from a normal cigarette, yes, but I didn't foresee them smelling like weed. The taste was (to me) also horrible. Not to mention, after a couple puffs I ended up with a major headache. I love the idea of something like this and I really did want to like them. However, given my experience with these, I'd much rather just keep smoking until I muster up the willpower to quit on my own."
1,Seductive smoking? Yeah right!,"I've never smoker before, so i felt the need to try it. I didn't really want to smoke a cigarette that contained tar or nicotine. Anywho long story short..i stumbled among these ecstacy herbal cigarettes. I tried smoking them, i really did, but boy did they taste horrible. I only took 3 puffs and when I walked into my lecture i stank the whole place. Woo hoo for me. So, I don't advise you to get these. But then again i'm not a smoker and this is my first time smoking so i'm no expert. But seriouly, don't get them;p"
3,The Power of Browder,"I watched this movie solely because Ben Browder was in the cast. I was delighted to find Kirstie Alley, as well.I found myself fast forwarding after the first few minutes, checked out Browder's performances, then went back and watched the whole thing to try to give it a chance.After reading other reviews, I guess I was bored because, although I am a fan of strong and independent women, I am in no way a feminist. I can only assume that's what colored my opinion, because none of these characters made me care about them, but they deserve at least 3 stars for making me want to throw things at the TV.Mr. Browder, however, does NOT fail to entertain! Although I may question his taste in scripts, he always turns in an energetic performance. I guess I'd even pay to see him watch paint dry. Slow drying enamel paint."
3,Nevada was OK,I did enjoy Nevada. I thought the acting was very good. I just dont understand the storyline. I agree with the statement from the customer who said what family hasnt had promblems. the women in the movie i found to be very selfish. What kind of mother leaves her children behind just because shes tired of cleaning the house and making a meatloaf just because she wants to find her spirit. im tired of these feamle movies making women feel they should get up leave to find there interchild.
1,What are you people? On dope?,"As a straight-to-video release (especially one whose credits suggest it was a vanity production), I didn't expect much from this except a showcase for Amy Brenneman's pretty face and supernaturally fabulous hair. (If there was an Academy Award for hair, she'd get it. And why shouldn't there be one? More people care about hair than Sound Effects Editing.) But a plausible story would have been nice. And some narrative momentum to keep the eyelids open couldn't have hurt. But what made ""Nevada"" such a memorable stinker was Kirstie Alley in you-can-tell-I'm-a-serious-actress-because-I'm-willing-to-appear-so-unglamorous mode as the rootin'-tootin' lesbian sheriff. (Not that there's anything wrong with that!)"
2,Expected the movie to live up to the Movieline hype,"I read about Nevada a couple of years before it was made. The script made Movieline's top ten yet-to-be-produced list in Hollywood. I remember wondering what the script was all about. Well, after seeing the film, I wonder what all the talk was about.My biggest problem with the story was the pacing. It seemed misguided and melodramatic at times. There seemed to be no punch. I never felt like any of the characters were real. They all seemed to be demonstrations of people rather than revelations of real human beings. The only scene that came across real was the food ordering scene with Amos McPhadden and his children... the rest were attempts.Finally, the ending was plain awful. I hated how the climax was shot, executed and written.Overall, I applaud the effort. It's definitely original to some degree but when a director is blessed with such a great cast and makes such a poor film, I can't be generous with my criticism... YOU SHOULD'VE DONE BETTER!"
3,There is only one redeeming performance in this dog,and his name is Angus MacFadyen. these other actors and actresses REALLY need to find other work besides acting or get lessons!
3,Nevada,"Enjoyed the music mostly. I want to know who sang Danny Boy at the end of the movie. The credits show Paula Frazer. Never heard of her, but enjoyed her voice. Also they credit someone called Shea. Maybe Shea was the singer of Danny Boy. Anybody know?"
5,why they do it,"Stark, high intensity, in your face workings of the female mind, a must see for all confused males left wondering why a good thing suddenly evaporates into hell. Amy Brennan leads, assisted by Gabrielle Anwar and Kirsty Alley in this harsh portrayal of modern family problems played out in a hard land. Well worth a watch, and you might get an education."
2,"Great collection, horrible audio quality","I bought this as a CD, not as a download, so there should have been excellent audio quality. A lot of old recording artists are getting the remastering treatment, where all the pops and hisses of acetate master recordings are digitally ""cleaned up"" and clarity of sound is improved. None of that was apparently done for this release. The sound quality varies from horrible to so-so, which is a shame because as the set list goes, it's a great collection. I've played the CD maybe once or twice, but just can't bear to listen to the horrible audio. I guess I'll wait until someone has the sense to do Lead Belly right and remaster his recordings properly.I'd give this CD just 1 star because the quality is so bad, but the songs collected here are just so good that if you can live with poor audio quality, you might want it, though I would NOT recommend it. Please sample the tunes first, either here or at iTunes, to see what I mean about the audio quality."
2,A Mistake,"I guess I should have read the reviews of this video more closely. I am a 9th grade English teacher who teaches a brief unit on the history of English. Looking for new material (I currently use the PBS program, The Story of English) , I ordered Professor Elliot's video. After approximately fifteen minutes, I turned the video off and boxed it for return. The video is indeed a video of the professor at a lectern, talking. Nothing else, just a man talking. He talks very fast, too fast for high schoolers. One reviewer found his voice pleasing; I cannot agree. If you enjoyed lectures in college, you'll enjoy this one, but I would not recommend it for high school students."
4,A pleasant surprise,"Very well made, uplifting film. Nice to see a ""Depression"" era film that is simply about people trying to do good. With some great performances by very familiar faces and some not so familiar, this is a movie with a simple message... the thing that allows you to hold your head high is YOU... not material things."
2,Not well edited,"The director of this film was clearly able to elicit good performances from the actors...the problem comes from the storytelling, whether that be through the script or the editing, Kings of the Evening is disappointing because of the lack of fluidity. The music works. The performances are spot on. But this film is missing something. It's like they shot a bunch of amazing scenes that had nothing to do with each other. Tyson gives a good performance, but you'd think he was performancing in a series of scenes for his acting class. Man, I wanted to like this movie, but it just wasn't complete enough."
2,Kings of the Evening,"This was a pretty good movie, however not what I expected. It can be quite depressing as it reminds you of what we here in the U.S. maybe ready to go through again. It was a descent film though."
5,Fantastic Collection!,"This is just pounding stuff, man! check this out. I have a 10gb iPod and even though i have thousands of songs, this is the album that I keep coming back to every time. Awesome stuff.Check out the Vol.6 as well."
3,Good idea not engaging though,"I like the message of the book. I read this book with my 3rd and 4th grade literature group. We struggled to get through the book. THey were just not interested in it. So although the message is good, the book is not really interesting."
3,great but hard to be cleaned,"this is great for backing and storing food, the only problem about it is that when the food stick ""like tomato sauce""on the sides , and it really hard to be cleaned , i finally realized that i have to use aluminum spongeotherwise its great.I thought all glass wear are the same but i bought one from ikea which is much cheaper and never do this thing ."
2,Misleading,I thought the book was beautiful. But I was looking for a book on decorating my home the ranch style look. So although the pictures were great if I was looking for that kind of thing. It was not exactly the book I needed. Wonderful pictures!!
1,Beware! Used Book!,"Bought new, got used! This book was supposed to be a gift. I'm returning it because it was an old Dearborn Library book. Returns at Amazon are a pain in the...If it was new I'd give the book a very high rating, great for a coffee table book."
1,Gateway laptop did not recognize,I found this product to be a waste of money. My computer could not recognize the cord. I tried a few tricks and it still did nothing. Glad it was cheap because I would of been more frustrated if it wasn't ....
4,One of the best in the series,What keeps me form giving it five stars are the lack of proficiencies (see the complete book of dwarves) and there are to few kits for priests. Otherwise a great book!
5,The author was a elf,"That was what i and a fellow DM/player thought. Many things suggested really tip the balance in the favor of the elves.From the basic meditation sleep, to the incredible elven archer. The author also suggests removing the level cap for elves(!) and doubling the xp needed.Now as we all know, elven archers have mastery, dex, strength, magic arrow, magic bow and elven bonuses. This comes up to +4 to +19. The penalties to hit suggested by the book to balance the increased number of attacks are pretty useless in light of this. With a haste spell (1 year to an elf, so?). Attacks go up to 8. Try with an Articus Melee Manager. Contrast with a human fighter in terms of damage.The bladesinger is another poor balanced class. Less so than the elven archer but...All in all, you can get this book for information about elven lives(long and winding discourse) but think long and hard about any of the special abilities suggested."
5,This Book truly covers every detail of elven life,"I have Most of the ""complete"" books, and out of all of therace books I fell that this is the best put together.It includes time lines and specific references of how the elvesdiffer frow world to world. I also goes into detial on howelven daily life is, including marrage, myths, customs, holydaysfamily life. It also has many unique skills, spells, kits andother equipment. This book truly opens the gateway to elvenlife!!!"
4,"To be an elf, make them real","The player options books have some great options in them. The book of elves is no exception.In this book a player or DM will be able to play or represent elves with great vivid details. New classes, skills, and explanation of elven life will add depth and believability to any Campaign world.Even great as a tool for fantasy writers, this book will be the aha! that comes when you aren't really familiar with what it means to be an elf."
3,"Archer TO WEAK, Blademaster too strong","The book as ok i guess. Im really not into all of the elaborate rituals and things like that. I just wana play the game and roleplay to the best of my ability, this helps alittle i wll give it that. The archer i thought was too weak. It when standing still co uld attack at 3/1 but it NEVER IMPROVED, archers need to be able to fire more arrows as they advance. The blademaster is supposed to be a Fighter/Mage. They don't describe the mage part ATALL. Also the fighter is VERY strong. It is like a BUFFED UP fighter and a normal mage together in 1 class! (cheap if u ask me). Also it dosent give what hd u should roll or what experience table they use. I guess it was ok but lacked details like these"
3,Should not advertise as HX Hot Bite,Agree with previous poster. Purchased these in hopes of having better luck but knowing either way it was still a pretty good deal. Don't think they should be advertised as HX Hot Bite when almost half (16 out of 36) were HX bite. Believe this is deceptive.
2,more then have of them were not as decribed,I ordered 36 pack of HX HOT BITE and received MORE THEN OF HX BITE WHICH IS A DIFFERANT BALL. I REORDERED AND THE NEXT ORDER HAD 22 OUT OF 36 WRONG BALLS.
2,Item description is wrong,"The description for the item shows ""Binney Smith Crayola(R) Washable Markers, Broad Line, Assorted Classic Colors, Box Of 12"". However, if you look at the pictures, these are in fact NOT washable. Please fix this so that people do not accidently purchase non-washable markers for use by younger children."
3,Not what I expected,"I read reviews and even heard rave reviews from a friend of mine about what a great detective writer Lawrence Block so I tried this book. In all fairness he is an excellent writer in terms of his character development and writing style, but in terms of it being a detective novel I was disappointed. I thought his main character seemed hard to believe being that he was a kind of bar bum that had quit his job as a cop and spent his days and night drinking heavily. People seek him out at the bar, he doesn't seem really interested in taking their cases, doesn't care about getting paid and even the ways he solves the cases seemed weak. A lot of people seem to really like his work, but I wanted to let others know that I read this book because of all the great reviews and for me it did not stand up to all the hype."
3,I finished the book,"This book just OK. It took for ever to get from point A to point Bto point C. The writing is good, but the story, is slloowwww. Thebest way I can describe this book is if you can enjoy watching a nicelooking paint dry, then go ahead and give it a read."
4,Incredible atmosphere,"While not the best of the Scudder series, the atmosphere ofNew York bars can be tasted throughout this unsettling novel,and it tastes like wood soaked in beer. The poem to whichthe title refers is pretty darn intense. Block is tough. Heis a genius."
3,Not my type of hero - sorry,Well written and interesting book worth the read if you are a Marlow fan. Just not my style. Too much drinking and smoking and not enough detecting.
5,Loved it!!,"This was my first read by Lawrence Block. I had seen it on multiple mystery/detective lists so I decided to give it a try.I really liked the protagonist, who's having his mid life crisis - living in a hotel room and drinking quite heavily. Scudder isn't the Bosch type, rather he goes around looking for small jobs that will enable him to pay his utilities and child support.He agrees to take a case of a small robbery and then stuff happens. A very good detective books, highly recommend it - if you're into that type of books.Enjoy."
4,Nice casters,"Spokes of casters appear to have been sand-cast and are a bit rough to the the touch, but they are simple and functional. Bearing cover has a grease fitting. Mounting plates are slotted for mounting bolts (for up to maybe 3/8"" dia. bolts--I used 5/16"")."
2,Not Made of Leather,"These new Protec valve guards are not made of real leather, but synthetic leather. The older guards were made of real leather. Normally this is not a concern unless you are in a situation where your left hand sweats when you are playing - then this valve guard can get quite slippery. And since the new guards are synthetic, they do not mold to your horn like the original real leather guards."
2,Sucks battery juice,Sound is tinny but I expected that. My biggest complaint is that it sucks battery juice.
4,It Works,"It fills the need that i had for it, sound isn't bad and has decent projection. Would buy again if i needed to."
4,Great little speaker for the price,"I wasn't expecting a lot for this low price, but after I saw the good reviews, I decided to give it a whirl. I bought this so that I could play music for my baby with an iPad shuffle. It doesn't get very loud, but it got a lot louder than I expected for its diminutive size, and definitely loud enough for his new ears. Perfect for setting next to changing table or putting next to car seat. I would use it for my own music if it got a little louder, which is why I gave it 4 stars, but for what I bought it for, it works well."
4,This is the standard and essential endodontic textbook!,"This book is a classic in endodontics. A must for every dental student- you probably dont need any other books! Very thorough. A bit too much on infection control and diagnosis, and a bit too little on more modern technological ""gizmos"" is common use. Color photos would be good, but the contributors consist of the most notable endodontists."
2,More Appropriate for post-doc students,"We read this text from cover to cover for our pre-doc endo course at NSU. To say the least, the text was wordy and often got distracted with details that are insignificant to the general practitioner and unnecessary for the pre-doc student. The faculty at nova have promised to review other texts in preparation for next year's class. Trust me, this book will force you to wade through a sea of useless information to find the clinically pertinant information. Don't waste your time unless you are obsessed with details. I hope this was helpful."
4,"More early Picard, and a weak story","The evil, indomitable aliens are cutting a swath through Federation space! Picard can solve it, and without bloodshed! But only because . . . something. It was sort of not clear why he ignored the orders to attack the enemy, which wasn't supposed to happen until he had finished negotiations so perhaps was done for dramatic effect. Also why did the aliens decide to stop the big attack, and bring their spy back, but let everyone know about their intent? Anyway it's an okay story and fits into the series of Picard establishing himself as a life-long Federation officer."
2,short,i was bummed. thought i was going to see an entire episode but i was just pre views. might pay next time.
5,Great Series,"Love the Characters and the story line. I started watching because Marc Blucas was in it, but soon got caught up in the story."
5,Great show,I really really like this show & especially Callie Thorn ~ she is a very sexy lady & I hope the show continues for a long long time.
5,Wonderful,This series is wonderful and every episode is well executed. I love the relationship between Dani and Matt. Dani (Callie Thorne) is a very complex character and I think they chose the right actress for the job. I especially love her laugh.
2,DO NOT BUY,when i first bought this i was excited because i was going to use it to polish a model i brought. it did not polish my model at all. all it did was stay the same. i don't know if you guys have different results but this was not what i expected it to be like.
5,my new favorite movie,"I had never heard of this movie, but I rented it because of Morgan Freeman acting in it. This movie made me laugh, cry, and was a great treat. This is my new favorite movie. I love how the lives intertwine and the healing winds through everyones life in a touching and believable way. It was charming, and even when it took predictable turns they were unpredictable and clever. I would definitely watch it again."
5,a great way to spend some time with the family,finally a movie that points out the more important issues in life and that we all need each other...well done ron....now i need a james bond movie as i feel like i am a old man :)
5,Magical!,"Watching this movie left me spellbound from beginning to end. A lovely movie, with well-defined characters you wish you could live next door to. Perfectly cast, beautifully acted, sweet, funny, poignant, and yes--magical. Loved it!!"
4,Heartwarming . . .,". . . but slow-moving. The message this movie confirms that if you listen and show respect, have patience, love and care for the people near to you, as well as the willingness to see things from a different perspective, they will grow and bloom. Nice movie for a snowy, wintery night at home."
4,Magic of Belle Isle Thumbs Up,"Excellent! Perfect for person purchased for. Enjoyed the movie and of course Morgan Freeman would recommend to others, particullary those who enjoy Hallmark-type movies."
5,Morgan Freeman,This is one of the best films I have seen.It is a shame the general public does not appreciate a good film.
3,Magic of Belle Isle,"It was a nice movie. Sweet but a girlie move so I don't think it would be great for a man. I just happen to like Morgan Freeman. If you want a ""touchie feelie"" movie you will probably enjoy this one."
3,Just ok,I love Morgan Freeman but I could tell that everyone else was acting. I wanted to like it but it was just too apparent.
5,It will stay with me,This is a charming story and it will stay with me...It's a Hollywood tale with the magic of....oh i don't want to soil it for others so I'll leave it at that and say it was most enjoyable!
5,A very enjoyable feel good movie!,"Good plot, wonderful acting by the entire cast but especially Morgan Freeman. Some great human insights in this movie, it will make you feel good."
5,Magic of Belle Isle,This is an absolutely awesome movie. Excellent writing. Morgan Freeman at his best. A super family movie. It is now one of my all time classic favorites.
3,It was okay,"not as good as I had hoped, but still entertaining. Just my opinion, my son thought it was really a good movie"
5,great family movie,another very enjoyable film with Morgan Freeman that is suitable for the whole family but not too sappy or sad
2,I saw it twice by accdent-Morgan is way under utilized in ths film. His sense of humor isnt allowed to shine!,"This movie you need to watch twice, you may have dozed off the frst time. Good for famly if your trying to explan death to younger children and some adults who never really get it. Morgan as usual imparts some very good life lessons courtesy of Reiner. I jwouldve enjoyed the lake if you ever really got to see it. You dont have enough of a back drop to make good on the lagging storyline. Its an ""eh"" for me. really wanted to like it due to Morgan and Reiner teaming up. Not meaty enough the story, couldnt figure out what the magic was either with a drunken old man in a wheelchar railing against everything including air! I mean ar was making hm mad. /My own dumb jokes were funnier to me. Sorry guys, love you both, but PU. Cant win em all."
2,Don't be fooled by the positive reviews - FLAT and UNBELIEVABLE,"Maybe I saw all the good reviews and got my hopes up, but this movie had so much potential to be great but falls incredibly short. Morgan Freeman is the only bright spot. Seriously. All the other actors are terrible in comparison, and the whole movie feels stiff and fake. The dialogue is flat and in no way believable, except for Morgan Freeman (the lone reason this review manages 2 stars). I am surprised to be writing this negative review because I am definitely not a harsh movie critic, but I was very disappointed by this movie. It should be a great feel-good movie, but all I am feeling right now is that I wasted almost two hours of my life that I will never get back."
3,Not a very believable romance,"I thought this would be great- I mean how can you go wrong with the cast and director? I was disappointed. It was a good enough story, I suppose but the chemistry between Morgan Freeman's character and Virginia Madsen's character just was not there or believable. There was not a real good spark there, to my estimation. I would have believed how a friendship could have changed their lives but not a romance. There was just something missing."
2,The Magic of Belle Isle Review Fantasy,To glamorize an alcoholic in a family relationship is just plain wrong. They don't recover just because somebody loved them. In reality he would have ruined that family. Didn't go for this at all. Unrealistic... typical Hollywood make believe. When he bought the house next door the family was in big trouble...
2,predictable and not engaging,"I was really disappointed in this film and expected more. It is very predictable and the acting is also. I skipped through it. I love Morgan Freeman but this was not the best role for him and the supporting actors lacked a lot as well. It wasn't majic for me but everyone has their own opinion. It's not the worst film I have seen but it failed to keep me interested. I can see why it was put out early, not sure it will make it at the box office."
3,Lacks Magic,"We love Morgan Freeman and we were intrigued by the trailer enough to watch it.It wasn't great. It felt like the script was trying to do too much character development instead of just telling the story. There were some very well done, nuanced exhibitions of storytelling. But overall this film fell flat."
3,I enjoy anything with Morgan Freeman -,"Wasn't the usual Morgan Freeman role. He is such a great actor and didnt show his depth - more fluff but cute, nonltheless."
4,My review,A nice movie to sit back and relax toHas a good storyline and a message of never giving up
1,Weak acting and story...blah,"Given a good story and script, Morgan Freeman can reveal the excellent actor that he is. On the flipside, given a weak story and mediocre fellow actors, even Morgan can bore his audience as he does in this movie. Contrived and stilted acting make this tough to watch. Skip it."
1,Not Closed Captioned,"I rented this dvd because I love all of Morgan Freeman's movies. Even though the format shows it is available in closed caption, it is not. I was very surprised and disappointed. I thought all new movies were being made to have closed caption. It is subtitled in Spanish but that did not help me any."
4,Good movie,We were not expecting much and this film was very enjoyable. It has a good story and it made for a nice evening
5,Feel Good Movie for entire family,This movie was very moving for the entire family. We all enjoyed it as it left us all walking away feeling good at the end.The ending was the greatest ending that we have seen in a movie for a long time.Really worth watching !!!
3,Not Morgans best movie.,"It was just okay. I thought it was kind of predictable and more just of an average movie.Not Morgans best movie, although he did a fine job and so did the other actors. The plot was dull."
5,It's Morgan Freeman,"I'm not a movie critic and don't have anything to add that hasn't already been said, but I'm usually not into these type of movies but I am a Morgan Freeman fan. He makes the movie. I'm not sure that I've ever seen a movie with him that I don't like. Good job dear sir."
3,Freeman the Great,"Can't go too far off with Freeman the center of the show. All the characters were believable for this viewer accept Madsen, who seemed to hold back rather than fully commit to her character. Freeman is captivating as usual, and the children likewise are surprisingly believable. The story is engaging and uplifting without being too sugary. Combination screenplay and good acting, make for plenty of laugh-out-loud moments :) Highly recommend."
2,Sappy,"I am very surprised that this movie has received such good ratings. It's very contrived and predictably unrealistic. I love just listening to Morgan Freeman talk, Emma Fuhrmann is a great little actress as his protege Finn, but overall it was a poor movie."
2,Sappy Sweet,"Not a bad movie--good time pass. Almost too sweet though, a la Hallmark channel or Lifetime movie. Nice story overall."
2,Did not resonate,Flat. Implausible. So not Rob Reiner. Strange transitions. Just plain did not work. I am suprised at the number of very positive reviews of this film.
3,Cute for kids,I chose the movie because I like Morgan Freeman. My 14 year old daughter thought the movie was cute and had a few chuckles throughout. Nice family movie without violence and profanity.
4,Magic of Belle Isle,Magic of Belle Isle is an excellent feel good family movie. Morgan Freeman as a crusty old writer is at his best. Romantic relationship between Freeman and much younger female lead character is somewhat hard to believe .
5,Great Movie with Favorite Actors,"This movie was a simple, uncomplicated story of a man down on his luck (mostly self-induced) who is rescued by the beautiful princess. I loved the way the community came together around its members. I needed to watch something that was not overwrought with conflict and/or bloodshed, and this film was just a simple feel-good flick about life working out allright."
3,They forgot the magic!,This movie kinda fell flat. Improbable ending and no chemistry between the actors. Hard to believe this is a Rob Rhiner movie.
2,garbble dvd,i couldnt watch the last 45 minutes of movie dvd was messed up and pic kept stopping and slowing down and skipping to point where it just froze.. i hope the next copy i get is better
5,Endearing and great acting,Watched this movie for the first time and fell in love with it. Already a fan of Morgan Freeman this movie was true to his character as an actor. Very endearing and heartfelt. Freeman a writer is down on himself and he comes to a house to stay for the summer where he again finds himself plus more.
2,"Sweet, but boring.","Safe to watch with kids, except for some unnecessary language. It played out like a Hallmark Channel movie, not a feature film. The story was sweet, but boring and predictable. Really enjoyed Morgan Freeman."
4,Morgan Freeman -- Oh Yeah!,"Enjoyed the feel-good film. Sadly, most of these films don't include subtitles. For folks who suffer a hearing impairment, Amazon is not the best place to rent films. Maybe subtitles are available but don't know how to get them. ???"
5,"""A STUNNING PERFORMANCE OF MORGAN FREEMAN!""","I have Enjoyed Morgan Freeman in almost every movie he was in, and this one is no exception! He is Stunning as he plays the role as an author who lost his muse, due to his excessive drinking problem, until he meets a single mom who inspires him to return to his writing. The story is engaging as it grabs your attention, is dramatic and has funny scenes. Overall, Delightful And Entertaining. I would watch it again. Highly Recommended!"
5,Kudos,Epic movie had all the elements of a timeless masterpiece.This one is worth owning and watching again. Great story and amazing acting.
5,A feel good movie!,"Clean story line about people and their lives the way they should treat each other. Color, age makes no difference. Just respect one another, even the dog was genuine. Life and its trials overcome by decent good people....I LOVED IT."
5,Morgan freeman is awesome in this,"Watched this moviie on the plane to Hawaii, another one of those movies that I was un familiar with, but turned out to be really good"
3,The Magic of Belle Isle,"It was a very sweet film. Anything Morgan Freeman is in, is a worthwhile watch. He's a fabulous and wonderful actor."
4,Really nice.,"I just adored this film. It has such a wholesome ring to it, and kids and pets, and life like we wish it were instead of like it is. Acting is good, but directing is the best. It seems to always be like that with Rob Rhyner? Gosh he's such a great director, and it shows in this film that I think you'll love, unless your looking for rap artist that can't act at all, or war, drugs and violence, then this ""ISN'T"" the film for you. I loved it."
2,Disappointment,Unrealistic coincidences and overly sentimental storyline mar a good performance by Morgan Freeman. The shorter length of the film kept it tolerable.
3,Good Family Movie from Amazon.com,I always like the movies that Morgan Freeman does. He has that voice that just tells a story. This is a good family movie and would recommend it to others. Also great prices for purchasing through Amazon online downloading.
3,"Great acting, highly implausible storyline","Monte Wildhorn (Morgan Freeman) is a wheelchair bound geriatric man in the twilight of his years who chooses to get away for city life in hopes that it'll cure his writers' block. While there he meets much younger divorcée, Charlotte (Virginia Madsen) who along with her three daughters, warms his jaded, bitter heart.The fact that this movie is well-acted doesn't really make up for the fact that the two leads have little to no chemistry with each other which given what the film is about is pretty counterproductive to its intent. As such this turns into less of a 'feel good' film with romantic leanings and more of a 'feel perplexed' one. Also the obstacles the two need to overcome (for there always has to be obstacles in these kind of films) seemed to be solved way to easily."
4,Magic of Belle Isle,"The plot was good, but the age of the individuals that are attracted to each other is a little much."
4,"Belle Isle is a nice, feel good movie...",The Magic of Belle Isle is a movie to be watched when one needs a reminder of the need to keep on - keeping on. Morgan Freeman plays a character with hardships that affect his physical nature. The character also has personal hardships that affect his emotional well being. Belle Isle is the story of a writer that finds his way back to living life. I thought it was a decent movie. I only gave this movie 4 stars as the romantic connection between Freeman and Madsen just doesn't work. I would recommend this movie to others.
3,Good story,It needed more storyline. It hinted at the possible relationship between the major characters but it left it up to the public to decide. The Director and writers didn't use Freedman and Madsen to make an impactful movie.
3,Ok movie,"This movie was just ok. It was pleasant to watch, and had some good moments, but it was very predictable and honestly a little unbelievable. Morgan Freeman, as usual, was brilliant but even he seemed bored. If you like sappy, feel-good movies you will like this. But if you like more intelligent movies you should probably look elsewhere."
4,Very heartwarming.,Morgan Freeman was outstanding. This is a very heart warming movie. It may bring tears to your eyes. Watch it.
4,Well worth watching.,"Morgan Freeman is as you would expect fantastic in this movie. Good story line and as my wife puts it, ""cute movie""."
2,Disappointed,"This is one of those films where you keep waiting for something to happen, and along the way there's a lot of bad acting. I'm a fan of Nicole Conn, and I know this is one of her earlier works, but it was pretty, for a better choice of words, lame. I am looking forward to her next film, ""A Perfect Ending,"" however."
3,It was better when it first came out.,This was a great movie twenty years ago. It lost some of it's flair and excitement as more and better movies of this genre have been released.
2,Overblown,Wayyy to angsty for me. The sort of thing you might watch if you were an angsty art house person.
4,Organic farming for the open minded,"This was a great movie. The Soundtrack and scenery were mesmerizing. It's a very good introduction to Bio-Dynamic gardening. The movie doesn't preach any of the practices shown here. It shows the practice in use, without explaining much of what's behind it. So If your already inclined to organic gardening and planting with phases of the moon, then this practice could be for you. The movie was inspiring, thought provoking, and should set a new standard for the way (gardening/ organic gardening/ farming) how to videos should be done. I've since purchased several books on the subject as a result of viewing this movie."
3,Okay Film about Biodynamic Farming and it's Applications,"This last summer I spent working on a biodynamic farm, while I was there I watched this video. It has a very basic (and good if not a little big long) introduction to biodynamic agriculture (the way of farming invented by Rudolf Steiner - a mystic/occultist who lived in the 1800s) especially as applied in India."
5,An awakening experience,"If a picture is worth a thousand words - then this video is worth millions. Humanity will take a great stride in guaranteeing its survival if we apply the biodynamic principles expressed in the film, 'How to Save the World'. In an artistic and engaging fashion - we learn about the application of biodynamic farming in India, and how successful and economical it is when compared to expensive and destructive chemical-dependent farming. If you are into farming on a minor or major scale, or know someone who has a small garden in their backyard - the gift of this eye-opening film will be something they will forever thank you for."
5,"Yes, It Starts Here","I love this film! I am a researcher in the area of sustainable agriculture and applaud the filmmakers on a superb job of pertraying the problems with agriculture and solutions. The principles outlined can be put into practice around the world, not just in India. There are ways to go even beyond organics (Beyond Organix, meaning organic PLUS testing for needed nutrients, adding minerals and beneficial bacteria to balance the soil so that it can produce bumper crops of pest-free produce that tastes great and has a long shelf-life. Best of all it is extremely health-promoting while being good for the environment.)"
4,Nice but...,"This is a very pretty light but there are a couple of things to be aware of. One, it's huge. I looked at the dimensions prior to buying it but I obviously didn't look close enough otherwise I would have bought the smaller cheaper one. It throws tons of light so I'm sure the smaller one's wattage would have been fine.Two, I climb some stairs to get to the door where I use this light and I can see the hardware that is used to hold the panels in when climbing up. If you don't approach from below you won't have this issue."
5,Hubby likes!,"We were just about spend a bundle on light fixtures from another company when I though I'd check Amazon to see what they had available. The photo looked very similar to the ones we were about to purchase, but the price was MUCH less. So, I decided to buy a few and see how they were.Pleasantly surprised! My husband not only loves the way they look, but is also happy that they are energy efficient and have a setting for automatic off/on based on the amount of outdoor natural light available. And we saved a ton with Free Supersaver Shipping!We've had them up for over a month now and they are doing fine in our every changing inclimate Feb/Mar weather (intense sun, heavy rain and high winds) in Hawaii. Great Deal!"
3,Give it 3 1/2 stars,"This effort by James is hit or miss for me. While I'm impressed with some of the huge arrangements I'm less impressed with the way they are presented. All too often the banjo or harmonica is too front and center in the mix, overwhelming the rest of what is going on. And some of these songs have tuba, banjo, mandolin and a couple guitars all at once. That said there is some real jumpin' (jug style?) music here as well as some simple acoustic pieces. The real stand out is Downbound Train, worth the price of the CD, in my opinion. The song is barreling toward Hell and taking you with it, a rip-roaring version that I play over and over. Also notable are Ooze it to me Mama, Blues Widow with it's meandering piano lines, Viola Lee Blues and Libery. A notable guest on several songs is Bob Brozman, no slouch at playing slide guitar."
3,Interesting,"The movies were a bit strange but I liked that the native americans were the heros in the films and not the white man who spent so much effort trying to destroy the indigenious peoples of the Americas both in history and on film.We need more up to date fims like this showing our Native Americans in positive light and giving them the respect and honor that they deserve. Even though these films were originally used as propaganda against the United states, I find that they are now useful to provide positive image of our real americans."
1,Revie for Chistorra Sausage Quijote Brand,"Warning: This is not Authentic Chistorra!I bought this product because there I have not been able to find chistorra near my town. I have had authentic chistorra from Mexico and Spain and I can tell it is not as good as the original ones. This one also contains more fat than lean pork meat. Secondly, this chistorra contains dairy, whereas the original does not. Thirdly, it is slightly expensive so I would not buy this if you can find chistorra locally. For some reason Mexican and Spanish products made in the USA (like Quijote) are not very good; I will never buy chistorra brand products again!"
4,Great for a lightweight wheel,"I have used this wheel for engineering field inspection work. It's great for a backup wheel that stays in the vehicle as it folds in half and doesn't catch on things. No stand to get in the way. I like it for measuring high quantities of pavement. Lightweight for carrying between areas and easy to maneuver. Every wheel we've used of this model has, without exception, ended up with a loose set screw. (The screw that keeps the plastic folding joint set on the handle). Put epoxy on it to stop it from loosening up. There is a warranty, but it will loosen up over time. Every one we've had in the past 10 years has done so. This was just ordered this as a replacement for one that got run over. The screw started to loosen on the second day. Great wheel for the price. Just accept the epoxy fix."
2,A must-read for fans but...,"After reading Rudy Rucker's Software, Wetware et al, this book is a must have/must read. But I found it a bit of a letdown compared to the others. I kinda had the feeling that Rudy was trying too hard to ""be a better *writer*"", like maybe he took a writing course and it ruined him <grin>. The ideas stop coming around 1/2 way through the book, and the rest gets to be ""she went here, he did this, she did that, blah-blah..."". His previous books left me with a lot of ideas and images that I can never forget... ice-cream trucks that steal and freeze your head, cosmic rays that encode alien personalities... but from this one, mostly I remember being unpleasantly stuck in bubble.I loved the others in the series but this one fell flat for me. Still, if you've read the others you have to read this one too."
2,"Rudy Rucker's NICE book - Beaver Cleaver, Clean & Sober","Nice, yeah, like warm milk and chocolate chip cookies. (Rudy, what were attempting? did you get what you wanted? what your editors wanted?) This book doesn't have the insane edge, like his earlier three books of the same series (Software, Wetware, Freeware), as well as, Hacker & the Ants. I've read all these other books at least 3 times each and own numerous copies of them. I think they are great reads and have given copies out to friends for years to turn them onto Rucker. But this latest? It ends with a wonderful double wedding and everyone lives happily every after. Yucch! Too Wholesome. I get the impression that Rucker was trying for a ""Caledcott"" award winner. Vapid & insipid, as accused above? Yes, I'd have to agree. I'm still a Rucker fan. But this one tastes like baby pablum."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Realware is nowhere near as much fun as the other three books in thewhole Ware series. The theme and tone have changed considerably.You get a feelgood romance thrown in there for no real apparentreason. The Realware of the title is the technology to be able to makewhatever you want, basically. Chuck in some aliens and other dimensions."
1,Maybe it's paranoia but...,"I loved Rudy Rucker's other books - all of them - to the point of obsession. This ""clean and sober"" [stuff] in this one finally cinches it for me: I'm now CERTAIN the ONDCP's antidrug campaign is targeting book publishers as well as TV, radio and movie producers. Essentially, the media is being paid by the government to pump out antidrug propaganda, and make it come from the very mouths of the drug culture heroes and top minds. Two weeks ago I just heard Neil Young praising the Patriot Act and giving a speech saying ""we all need to give up our freedoms for a while so we can keep them for the long term"". Now it seems they've got Rudy, too. How do they do this? Pay them off, or threaten to off them? Who knows? All I know is this left me with tears in my eyes and believe me they were NOT tears of joy."
3,It's no so essential!,"Good music but not essential and too commercial. Nice song of Andy Caldwell beautiful of the Weekender, the rest a little anonimus. In any case professional voices (most female) are present in this CD. Each track it's so similar to the previus one. Frankly speaking the product it's not a chilly it's not a soul-funky-jazz ...it's a dance floor cd to far from the downtempo compilations that i like."
1,Is this a joke?,I listened to a few of the samples and they sound like they're played by a beginning student on an out of tune guitar. Plus the recording quality is terrible - it sounds like a home recording. The titles make no sense - is this some kind of joke?
4,"A dark, moody score","""Daredevil,"" the original motion picture score by Graeme Revell, is an interesting addition to one of my favorite musical genres: the superhero film score. Overall, this is a dark and somber score. There is good use of a choir and also some interesting multilayered percussion. Although much of the score struck me as subdued, the track entitled ""The Kingpin"" is noteworthy for its frenzied energy. The tender ""Elektra"" is an interesting counterpoint to other parts of the score. Although not my favorite superhero score, ""Daredevil"" is definitely worth listening to."
4,Dark but ultimately triumphant film score,"I admit I'm not a big fan of Graeme Revell. I have perhaps 4 of his scores in my collection of 350. I collect super-hero scores and Daredevil was no different except that it was pretty good. It captured the essence of Daredevil in a dark score that ultimately triumphs. Revell's main theme is enjoyable, but actually, the Murdock theme that plays in the quiet moments is what really gets to the heart of a super hero. I rate Daredevil higher than many other scores because it is interesting and different from many other score."
2,Not so good...,"I am a big fan of some of Revell's other work, and I usually enjoy the comic/superhero scores, so I paid close attention to the music while watching the movie. Alongside the film, I thought the score provided a pretty good complement for several key scenes, but unfortunately, I didn't find this score very entertaining after listening to it by itself. Most of the tracks seem uninspired and a little slow, and the overall score seems to be so overwhelmed with dark, brooding, mysterious qualities that it never really identifies the essence of the Daredevil character or a good movie theme. I was disappointed."
1,Not my style,"I don't even remember what prompted me to purchase this item. Mostly noise, but then that genre is low on my list of music."
4,Funky Florida Disco,"The Florida band Foxy's second album Get Off from 1978 provides the rawer, funkier side of the 1970s disco sound. Male vocals have a prominent role in the arrangements and there are strong Latin influences. The percussive & uptempo track You with its appealing instrumental variation is a highlight, as is Get Off, a mid-tempo track with charming female backing vocals by The Wildflowers. Goin' Back To You is a slow, romantic ballad and It's Happening is a catchy track with pop appeal. Other enjoyable numbers include Mademoiselle with its cool clavinet sounds and the rhythmic Tena's Song with ebullient arrangement and festive feel."
5,Bought for son's criminal law class,I haven't read this yet. I bought for my son's criminal law serial killer class. He did say that it was an interesting book to read.
4,From Gutter to Gold,"Brian's life before his incarceration was described in such vivid detail at the beginning of his book that I felt like I was there. His life-style led him to prison, and then he found God. Today he's a success and role-model for others. As co-author of the upcoming book, ""Chicken Soup for the Prisoner's Soul,"" I found Brian's story fascinating. Yet, I think he has another book and story still to tell us...the details of who, what, and how his miraculous change took place. I look forward to reading his next book."
5,This CD is banging,"this cd is off the hook. the beats just keep getting better and better. of course it doesn't hurt that one of my tracks is featured on it, ""Por Volverte a Ver"", but I honestly think I would've still liked the compilation anyway. Kid Heartbreak is talented and knows what works and how to collaborate tight beats with artististic abilities- the boy got skills... Way to go Kid!-Yvette aka ""Dolly Leon"""
4,Indeed a party,"I love jam sessions where artists have a chance to roll on with their talents in prolonged sections. I guess that's what expected and was a bit disappointed. Many of the songs are 3-4 minute versions. It was indeed a party atmosphere and the frequent ""noises"" of encouragement and enjoyment from the crowd got in the way for me. The sound was less than optimal. Great talent, just not quiet what I had hoped for."
5,Traveling baby / stay at home dad,How can you review a stuffed monkey or a pair of them? They're cute. I carry baby monkey when I travel and send pictures back to my daughter. I did that long before the phone commercial that does the same thing. I've started buying sets of these so that I can give a mommy monkey / baby monkey or daddy monkey / baby monkey pair to my friends who travel as baby gifts when they have their first kid.
4,I have enjoyed this game,"I knew this product was Black Isle, so I was hoping it was on the same level as the Fallout series. I was not disappointed.This game is not a straight dungeon crawl. There are a multitude of quests to go on, and a lot of them involve running back and forth to places you have already been. (I personally hate that!)I think this may be more combat oriented than Fallout, and there isn't that dreaded timeline you have to beat. You simply get a quest, and accomplish it.Also, unlike Fallout, this game doesn't appear to have a turned based mode. It is live, which is fine, because that enforces more tactics, while still allowing you to function easily.I'm almost done with it, and I am looking forward to loading it on the wife's computer, so we can try multiplayer. A solid game."
1,Odiferous,"This game is just foul. It seems like Interplay and Reflexive were trying to create a game like Diablo but with more RPG elements, and failed disastrously. The ""alternate history"" theme is very interesting, but poorly executed. An on top of it all, the game is extremely short. I really wish I hadn't wasted $50 on this garbage."
1,Do not buy this game unless...,I repeat do not buy this game unless you are completely desperate for a crpg (i.e. you have played all others in existence). I played the demo and the full release is just as bad.
2,Maybe they should have Beta tested it.,"Don't buy this thing until you see a patch. I bought this around 8/28/03. Constant crashes to desktop.I went to their website to see what the problem was, and I am NOT the only one experiencing this problem. Don't hand them [the money] until they fix it.Game is worth playing but it's much more efficient when it WORKS."
3,"Play the first chapter, then quit","As the title says, the first chapter of this game is very intruiging. You get to choose which factions to follow, how to develop your character and have an interesting world at your fingertips. Unfortunately, after that, the rest of the game is a major letdown. The plotline is obvious and very linear (your beginning choices no longer matter) and it quickly becomes boring and painful to play. If you can find this game cheap and used, go for it, play the first chapter and then stop. You'll be left with happy memories of a fun game."
2,Great quarter-game,"This game was really fun at first. Barcelona is fun like the city of Amn in Baulder's gate...but that's all that there is to this game.The people that join you just follow you around. You can't interact with them or control and develope them like Ice Wind Dale or baulder's gate. If you want a hack and slash, get Dungeon Seige...if you want a real rpg with a plot, get BGII."
2,disappointment,"When I first read about this game I thought it would be one that I could enjoy. I am an RPG addict. This game, however, was not the RPG it promises to be. Very boring, mini map has no waypoints to help you along, and some of the quests appear to be broken. This game no longer spins in my disc tray."
3,Diablo II revisited,"If you liked Diablo II, you will most likely enjoy Lionheart.- Yes, the storyline and quests are rather shallow. But they are just complex enough to keep you interested in finding out what the next zone holds.- I really enjoy how quests are organized by active, completed and failed. With semi-completed portions of quests being greyed out, it is very easy to track what you need to do.- Learn lockpick and detect secret early on. You'll need them.- 800x600 video? C'mon, this is 2003. You'll be using F2 alot to minizime the control bar. I enjoy ranged attacks, and 800x600 does not offer alot of reaction time.- Someone else mentioned this, but its worth reiterating: there should be a chart allowing users to know how a skill strengthens based on the points pumped into it. For example, I keep pumping up heal, yet I don't seem to heal any faster everytime I use it. Very frustrating.- Amazon just dropped their price on the game. At $30 its worth the cost."
2,Yawn!,"Dull, dull, dull... This game is really not up to the standard we have come to expect from Black Isle and Interplay. Primary Headaches: Inability to pause and target enemies during combat. (Makes archers and magic users just about useless), Boring quests - the kind we expected in the early days of roleplaying. Games is not the most stable I have seen either. All in all, you are better off going back and paying an earlier Black Isle game."
1,DONT Bother with this game!,"Bought this game and had hoped it would be an RPG worth playing. The first half of the game plays well, it is balanced and fun to play. The second half on this game after the Crypt of the Lance and Nostradamus quest (English Invasion of Spain) is THE WORST thought out combat system of any RPG! From here the games is no longer an RPG, it becomes a hack and slash with the games combat engine favoring enemy character which you CANNOT go one on one melee without allied help or more healing items than the games merchants allow you to buy.Overall, I give this game one star. Dont waste your time with this game!"
2,dull house music,"This is where house music gets its reputation as boring and repetitive. The tracks all follow the same format - continuous four on the floor beats with few changes in energy level or presentation. House music needs to be more dynamic to keep my attention. Add some more percussion and the jazzy rhythms would come to life. Unless you're a DJ and you plan to mix this CD, don't bother."
5,A great start to a great band,"I cannot say enough about Swell. They are a wildly underrated band, sort of an indie-pop Helmet, if you will. This is, as far as I know, their very first album first released on vinyl in the late 80s and then again on cassette tape shortly afterward. Poppy upbeat songs alternate with shoe gazing, and sometimes even menacingly dark tracks. 'Sick side of a church' is an electric organ peice with a sample of a man on a street corner preaching his twisted views to an uncaring world. Wooden Hippie Nice [wouldn't it be nice] is about as happy as I have ever heard this band, almost dreamily euphoric. A very fun album from a band destined to do great things."
1,Save your money,"Last fall I used this book to study for the PSAT. I found it to be of minimal value. There were loads of mistakes and the practice tests did not accurately reflect the actual exam in level of difficulty. Friends of mine who have the same grades that I do used other books and did much better than I did. I can't totally blame the book, but I did work hard and don't feel that this book helped much at all. I would definitely recommend that you try something else"
1,errata,We found a mistake in the first section of the diagnostic test. For number 7 the question is stated incorrectly as you can see when you look at the explanation. Books like this are worthless if you can't trust that they are written correctly. This mistake was found on page 18 of a 582 page book. Who knows how many more there were but I returned it to the store as soon as we saw the first one.
3,"A nice book for the beginner, but not complete","Allmen's book is a nice reference, but not an absolute essential. It has some valuable information in the beginning, such as how to determine the age of a card and so on, but her examples aren't as plentiful as one would wish. As well, her prices aren't current, and having been published in 1990, cannot possibly reflect the kind of resurgance in interest in postcards that places like Ebay and Amazon auctions are generating. But if you're a dealer or a serious collector it's a nice book to add to your shelf."
4,Unique but with flaws,"This product is clever and unique, but has its flaws. I also purchased a Fisher Price doctor set to go with this one and with good reason. The concept and uniqueness of this product is great, but within the first hour of using the stethoscope it was broken-- not by hard use, but because the stethoscope is made very poorly. Also the crayons, even though reinforced with tape by me, are not made well. ln my opinion, the manufacturer should replace both the stethoscope and the crayons with better quality items, thus making this a much better product."
5,Pefect for 2,"The perfect pot for small meals for 1 or 2. A pot of stew, beans, soup, etc. Easy clean up and easy storage. Highly recommended!!!"
3,A Little Ripped Off,"To be honest as a UK citizen I feel a little bit cheated here as the single version of 'So Far Away' doesn't have the exclusive track Novocain that the American version does it just has a live version of Mudshovel. Also it has a somewhat pointless 'Radio Edit'of 'So Far Away' which is only around 20 seconds shorter than the original. I don't know what purpose the edit was for as I never heard it played on UK radio once and to the best of my knowledge the track failed to make the UK top 75 singles. The additional homegrown footage is quite nice though, carrying on from where the footage on 14 Shades of Grey's bonus DVD left off. This single was released on two formats in the UK. Available seperately is a DVD which has the video plus an acoustic version of Zoe Jane recorded for KROQ and is better value for money than this."
4,Great game,"I bought this set mainly for the Aggravation game. I love it and you can't even find the board game in stores anymore. From what I can see, it is pretty much like the board game. The only thing is that you don't have your family in the room with you playing. You know, FAMILY TIME. You can play against your family by networking your home computers, which we have done and chat with them through the game. Its fun, but not as fun as a good game together in the same room. Overall, this is still a great game. I still recommend the buy!!!"
1,BAD BOOK,This is an awful book with terrible examples and poorly worded concepts. The homework has only a tenuous relationship to the text at best. Stay away from this book if at all possible.
1,My first review while buying for years at amazon,"Signals, Systems, and Transforms (4th Edition)I was suppose to get this book in the picture but instead i received from the seller an international edition that was not mention to me in the beginning for not saying never. I received an international edition that i di not ask for and was charge way more to the one i originally thougth i would received. The answer manual that was given with is hard to access and whfinally get though does not correspond to the book i received.I was deceived about the transaction but i will recognized that he will send you the book anyways."
1,Terrible text,"Signals & Systems is a very complex topic - it needs to be presented in a very clear and consise manner with plenty of examples and explanation. This text has none of those qualities. I supplemented this text with the Shaums's Outline for Signals & Systems; I still could barely follow the class. A much better text on the topic is ""Signals and Systems"" by Simon Haykin and Barry Van Veen. It accomplished in one edition what ""Signals, Systems, and Transforms"" has not accomplished in three."
1,think twice before getting,"unless you have an awesome professor that teaches in detail your going to need additional books/resources to help you learn the subject. all the information in the book is vague, it goes into very little detail, and doesnt help you complete the problems at the end of the chapters"
1,Can't learn anything from this,"Honestly this book is terrible. The chapters explanations are not broken up well, which makes finding information for solving problems very hard. I frequently found myself reading a chapter 2-3 times just to get a vague understanding of what they mean. And to top it off, the useful equations were often sandwiched between the steps of a derivation without any distinction.Only buy this book if your class requires it, and then only use it for the required homework problems. Buy another book to learn from."
1,More of the Same from Ed Decker,"When Ed Decker offers to inform you about the Mormons, run -- don't walk -- the other direction. This man simply can't, or won't, tell the truth. His writing is sensationalistic, uninformed, and malicious. There are good books on Mormonism. Many of them. There are even some (relatively) respectable anti-Mormon books. Nothing touched by Ed Decker qualifies as respectable."
1,Decker -- Spoken Like a Fool,"Decker is one of those people that are guilty of something. Can one really look at what he does and really think, ""Oh, what a great service he is doing."" Poor Ed Decker. Regardless of what he thinks and of his theories and opinions, if it is the Lord's work, surely the Lord's work will be done. And if Mr. Decker is a Christian and if he claims to be doing people a service, wouldn't he then be called of God since ""God does nothing save he calls prophets and apostles.""? Someone ask Decker who gave him the authority to lead God's church. What a funny coincidence, only the Mormons and Catholics have a substantial claim to authority. Hmmm. . . . I wonder which one is true."
5,One of my go-to albums,"The in-your-face, stripped down style of the songs on this album make it one of my faves. In the car, in the headphones, on the computer. It's hard to know what to say is the best track on the album. I think John Bates may be my favorite for the sheer brilliance of the lyrics.An excellent album - and they're fantastic live. I saw them in a tiny club in Dallas and bought the CD directly from the band. If you can, definitely go see them."
2,Not as thorough as I'd hoped,"As an evangelical, I had reason to read this book. I was hoping for a compelling history of our fundamentalist origins along with insights into what we've discarded from our heritage and what we've adapted to become what we are.Instead, the book was mostly personal ramblings.Since I was wanting thoughtful history rather than mere memory, I have to say I was disappointed."
5,"""THE BEST """,thank you for a very timely response you are the greatest and i will be backblessing and happy new yearMrs. Abrams
4,"Very Fine effort by Dave Irving, who will be speaking","in Southern California on June 14th,hawking his books, too I am told. Ijust got back from Mark Weber's groupsmeetting and it was great! Best wishesto all on June 14th. Oh, the review ofthis video; get the VHS while you can.They are going quickly. It is a very fineeffoert to correct some of the myths aboutWWII that have clouded our society since.WWII myths, still alive in the 21st Century?You bet!"
5,Amazing glue,"2-P10 is fast and strong! If you use the activator with the glue, the bond is instantaneous-no time for positioning. I found that for gluing joints in baseboards it was better not to use the activator, as I needed a few seconds to align the pieces. The strength is amazing, with or without the activator. After miters were glued together, the material broke before the glue joint (yes, I tried it!) The fine tips included with this kit work well with the thin glue for wicking into cracks. Works very well with plastics. This is definitely not your typical weak cheapo instant glue. Highly recommended. Now if Amazon sold it directly...."
5,Music for Flying Saucers and Peace,"Bernard Herrmann, the famous coposer of so many classics of the cinema, has never written a boring film score, and in this science fiction classic,he sets the standard high again for great film music. This film is one of the classic science fiction movies of all time and this film score matches its subject with great force, music of the heavens and space and great music for Gort the robot. Highly recommended. This music fills you with awe and great harmonies. Herrmann was one of our greatest film composers and anything he wrote is worth listening to again and again."
5,"Not the original, but well worth hearing","This is not the original, but a fairly faithfull re-recording of the score. Purists may be put off by this and wish to seek out the original, but I think most will find this a beautifully recorded album. There are only minor changes to be found here, most have to do with the difference in recording techniques. The sound is fuller and richer that the one used for the film. I have to admit I purchased this thinking it was the original, but any bad feelings I had about that fact quickly went away."
2,Don't compare this to a literal recording of the score in gravitas,"I have seen the original Day The Earth Stood Still (1951) more times than I can count; I am also a pretty fair classical pianist.To be fair, this CD was not represented as a soundtrack in any fashion; nevertheless, given the cover illustration and the name Bernard Herrmann plastered all over the insert, I had hoped for a stereo version which was an enrichment, an expansion of the score with the technology of 2011.The problem isn't lack of good will or effort--instead this recording fails in attention to detail and an inability to not only mix the music well, but to master the Theramin.Verdict: thanks for the effort, sorry you didn't capture the spirit or musicianship of the 20th Century Fox orchestra!Alfred Newman, where are you?!"
5,"Yes, it IS the original soundtrack--and then some!","In spite of all the confusion caused by other reviewers here, yes, this IS the original soundtrack recording. It is not in stereo. It sounds the way many soundtrack recordings sounded in the early 1950s (1951, to be specific). It's identical to the 20th Century Fox recording released in 1993 and found here:The Day The Earth Stood Still: 20th Century Fox Film Scores - The Classic SeriesEXCEPT for two extra tracks that are very exciting to Herrmannophiles such as me--Alternate Theremin Mixes and Studio Rehearsals and Outtakes.Well worth the money! The only soundtrack you will ever hear with an orchestra made up of two theremins, an electric violin, electric bass, four pianos, four harps, and 30-odd brass instruments!"
5,"I Stood Still, Too!","When I first saw the movie, on a Saturday afternoon ""Creature Feature"", with some family members, I bragged that the music was done John Williams ...because that same music was featured in ""Lost in Space"" over and over alot. Little did I realize, after looking at the credits, that it was Bernard Herrmann...in fact the 'recycled music' used in the LIS series was from this movie: ..DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL; and Bernard was never listed in the credits on the LIS TV show --not even as 'additional music by'--to avoid paying him any royalties; & that was WRONG. That just goes to show how GOOD the music is..a real treasure."
2,This is NOT the original soundtrack!,"This is a brand new stereo recording of the soundtrack made in 2002 at Abbey Road Studios. The original soundtrack was recorded in mono in Los Angeles in 1951. I really don't see the point of this project. It seems like few audiophiles would even be interested in this type of music while listeners wanting the original vintage - mono - ambiance would feel cheated (like ME). Also, the ""modernized"" cover art SUCKS."
2,Disappointing,"After trying practically every sippy/straw cup in the market, I have come to the conclusion that there is no truly leak-proof cup. Some just leak less than others. I had high hopes for this cup. I love the concept of the removable snack cup on the bottom. This cup not only leaks, but sprays liquid out every time you press the button on the lid and the contents continuously pour out of the straw. It's a horrible mess-definitely impractical for being on-the-go. Too bad. It is such a cute cup."
2,Love the look hate the leaks.....,I love the fact that the cup has 2 purposes and it's really cute but it leaks.
3,Regular Product,"My son is a fan of Thomas and his friends, is very happy with Thomas The Tank Snack N' Sip Canteen, the only problem is that to suck the liquid to do some strength because the liquid doesn't comes easily and is a bit annoying in the throat due to the strength you need to do when you suck any liquid.If your child has a throat problem is not advisable to buy the product because when drinking liquid in these products can complicate your health problem because of the strength you need to do when you suck."
3,Bad sound mix hurts great live band,"The band is great. The Music is great. The live Shows are fantastic. The Sound mix on this disc is far from great. This is one of the greatest live bands ever, and this recording does not do them justice. The Amazing Royal Crowns are still Royal to the Loyal, But this recording is anything but royal or loyal to the band's otherwise great sound. If you like Rockabilly then you'll love the Amazing Royal Crowns. Even though the band would HATE to admit it, Swing fans will enjoy this disc too. In my opinion, it is great rock and roll in the tradition of Elvis. I hope this disc gets remastered when the Crowns become famous, which isn't that far off from now. Jump on the band wagon now."
5,excellent,I received this product earlier than expeced(I live in australia)and was very happy with the qualityof this product.Since purchasing this CD I have brought a few more items and received them on time too.Thanks
4,Rockabilly Comeback,"I was very pleased to hear that the Crowns had re-released most of their songs. This remastered version is a far cry from the original demo and is a hoppin' good time to listen to. Yes, the singer is a little more punk than say, Brian Setzer (of the Stray Cats) but the use of an enormous stand up bass and the Colonel's occaisional psycho-billy riffs makes this album a must for sick boys, rockers and inde music fans."
4,still royal to the loyal,"This is the same as the self-titled, it was just re-released and the song order is different. Definitely keep an eye out for their live recordings, they are much better, but this is still a great cd. It is just completely different from how they now sound live! They put on a great live show, so if you liked this be sure to check them out."
4,The Loch,This book is cool cause I like the way everything is put together. The scene is like dark and people are gone.Most everything is silent and then the writer that says that there is something in the darkness moving. The whole book is like that and thats what I like about it. It just keeps you wondering about what will happen next. In this book thecharacters dont talk on and on about nothing. They have a point most of the time. The ending was alright thats why i gave it a rating of 4 cause it wasn't to good. Other than that the rest of the story is the best part and this was probably the best book I read so far.
5,loch,"a 17 year old boy nicknamed loch after a frightining encounter with nessie. finds himself caught up in a accident waiting to happen. his father dr. sam works for a selfish man by the name of cavenger. cavengers job is to find and capture ( dead or alive) leagends.(nessie, big foot, exc.) but every thing changes when a family of plesaureses gets trapped in a lake off of lake champlaine. loch must get cavengers daughter sarah ( his girlfriend), zaidee(his sister and dr. sam to help him rescue the family of plesaureses."
5,all i can say is this is the best book ever!!,I started to read this book and just chouldn't put it down its gets real good when the find the monsters and the rest is THIS BOOK RULES
4,Loch is an awesome thriller!,"Loch was an awesome book that had a quick pace, blood-curdling events, and cool characters. I absolutely loved this book. I read it for a book report, not really wanting to read it. I thought it would be good. Boy was i wrong. It was a great book that horror and adventure book fans will certainly enjoy."
4,Review For Loch,"LochPaul ZindellIF you like blood, gore, and violence all in the same book then check out this book by Paul Zindell. Dinosaurs are in the book aswell. Small ones and BIG ONES! This is about a scientist (Dr. Sam) who is led by a mean, order barking person named Cavenger. Loch and Zaidee are Dr. Sam's kids while Sarah is Cavenger's child. Loch and Sarah will get caught in the cutting room. Dr. Sam stops taking orders from Cavenger. The book called Loch is such a good book I guarantee you won't be able to put it down!"
4,"monsters,humans, and water oh my!","I think that this book blends some horror with a kids book of good vs. evil. They think Loch is crazy when he speaks of a monster but now its back and they can't stop it. Loch and his sister have to find a way to save the beasts before Cavenger kills them all. No one other than the people that live on the lake community and thats not many,so there on there own. Paul Zindel is a masterful author with alot going for him."
2,My review on Loch,"I read the book Loch for my 7th grade library project. It was a pretty good book for people who are like science fiction, but I like to read more books on things that could really happen. The basic plot for this book was that a boy and his family and friends are trying to solve the mystery of the Loch Ness Monster. I think a good age group for this book would be 3rd grade and up."
4,Good,"This is antoher one of those tight New orleans cds. It has tight beats to get the party started.His came There are a few songs i dont like but most of the cd is good. The best tracks to me are ward bangin and all for it. This record label put out some good music in the late 90's such as 211,ms.tee-hot girl,fila phil and charlie hanseen. I dont know what happened to the label but get anything you can because its good!"
4,Pretty Tight,"When I first heard Gs n Soldias, I was like PIMP! Then I got my hands on his commercial release, and it pops out New Orleans' beats like crazy. While there was some filler, a lot of songs on this cd was just crazy tight. Camoflauged down, Ward Bangin, Roll it up, All bout that drama, and Lil Niggas Thuggin are examples of great songs that will beat in my car for a while."
3,Mis-teeq are mis-sing something....,"Mis-Teeq are probably the 3rd best girl band I know around (2nd being TLC and 1st being Destiny's Child) and All I Want (the second single , and this time , minus the forth member) is their best so far , what being mixed by Ceri 'Sunship' Evans , but frankly the remixes are bad .The Sunship Radio Edit is by far the best track on the single , with it's garage club beat and bouncy vocals from Sabrina and Alysha , I only wish they could have made it longer.The Ignorants remix is slow and has an annoying keyboard in the backround.Shame about the Blacksmith Remix , which would be good (at the slow pace it is) without that irritating shouting rapper with no talent in the backround. Nothing against Mis-Teeq , but you need to choose the people who remix you better."
5,Breeding African Greys made easy!,"Ms Conzalez' book, Breeding Exotic Birds, is an absolute must for anyone keen on breeding these wonderful creatures. She is most knowledgeable on the subject and although concise, this book provides sufficient information to the beginner, not only to breed successfully, but also to control various common diseases, hand rearing babies, etc. Thanks to Ms Conzalez (and the African climate), we have never lost any babies - her book has become our ""practice manual"". I would highly recommend this book to anyone, even if only for a casual read."
5,Excellent must read,Mrs. Gonzalez' book has helpd me immensely when I started breeding my Cockatoos.The information in this book is worth thousand$ of dollars.She's right on point in every aspect of the book.Whever is considering or IS breeding parrots MUST have a copy of this book in their library...AAAA+++++!
4,"simple and complete information,a must have book","excellent book,written very simply and well organized."
4,Not quite as expected.,"These are very pretty, colorful, and have the butterfly's names on the back of each bookmark, but they are short- only 5 3/4"" long. I plan on having them laminated so hopefully will make them a little longer. They come in a book with 4 to a page, so they are perforated too, so I plan on using my paper cutter on them to eliminate the perforated sides. But these are well worth the price."
2,Not the best bookmarks,Brought these to hold my place in a book but would not purchase them again. They are flimsy and not as pretty as pictured. They are also tear-along-the-edges which makes them difficult to pull precisely. Save your money.
4,Twelve Butterfly Bookmarks,"I was a little disappointed because I thought these bookmarks were longer, instead of being very short in length, which is good if you are reading a short paperback. Otherwise, they would get lost in a larger book. However artistically, these bookmarks are detailed, beautiful, and very colorful. And if you do not mind that they are short, you will be very pleased with this purchase."
5,Love Pains,Just when you think Christy and Todd are officially together Gunn throws a wrench in the story by ending their relationship. I can't wait to read the last book in series to see how everything comes together for Christy as well as the next series that continues Christy's and Todd's story. Gunn does a wonderful job in describing in detail the happenings of a young girl's heart.
5,How did this guy not become hugely famous?,This is one of the best CDs I've heard in a long time. Buy this disc! You won't be disappointed if you like swampy blues.
1,Incomplete set! - warning,"Incomplete on both counts: Blue Note AND Verve!While this product claims to be the complete Blue Note and Verve recordings by Bud Powell, it only contains 45 of the 75 tracks that another boxed set contains. The set you're looking for is called Bud Powell, The Complete Blue Note and Roost Recordings, item number CDP 7243 8 30083 2 2. It was published in 1994 under the Blue Note label by Capitol Records. It's four discs in total, 4.6hrs of music. Very clear personnel listings.I just bought the set I'm describing, and I'm very happy with it.Also note there is a separate Bud Powell Complete Verve with over 100 tracks. It is sold by Amazon and comes up immediately when you search via it's ASIN: B0000046TK."
5,Getting Some Tango in Your Blood,"Alison Young, a flute recitalist of great poise and technical security, dazzling precision and virtuosic flare and the Principle Flute of the Houston Ballet Orchestra, demonstrates her considerable talents in ALISON YOUNG ... A LITTLE TANGO IN HER BLOOD. This work on the Albany Records label takes full advantage of Alison Young's experiences in Argentina as a musician artist-in-residence in 1998, performing and teaching in the regions of Patagonia, La Plata, Buenos Aires and Corrientes. Alison Young recreates the atmosphere of the native music of Argentina in a way that will transport you to South America. Composers highlighted in this work include Astor Piazzolla, Carlos Guastavino, Alberto Ginastera, Angel Lasala, Hector Gallac and Horacio Salgan. A newspaper in Argentina (Rio Negro) reported on ""...Alison Young, with a little tango in her blood"" and this wonderful collection of flute pieces will surely put a little tango in your blood as well."
1,"Live Ig,Dead Sound",It's impossible to tell if the band was any good the night this live recording was made...because it sounds like it was recorded on a cheap cassette deck hidden under someone's jacket in the middle of the crowd.I'm a die-hard fan but this is sonic garbage.
3,Iggy Pop - 'Live In L.A. '73' (Original Masters),"'Live In...' is apparently the same/exact show that was recorded at LA's famed Whiskey A Go Go on Sept.16,1973 that was also released under the title 'Live At The Whiskey A Go Go' on the French import label,Revenge.Although it's always nice to hear the Stooge classic foot-stompers like ""Raw Power"",""I Need Somebody"" and ""Gimme Danger"",I cannot really say there's much special about this CD,except for MAYBE the cool hand-drawn cover.Just another CD title for us Iggy die-hards."
2,Some Rare Recordings Need Not Be Released,"The audio quality sounds like an old soundboard cassette recording with lots of tape hiss and chewed tape or something to account for the occasional chop. . That said it is the only recording of this performance so for Iggy completists you need this. Others steer clear and pick another from the library of music from Iggy & The Stooges. While i'll admit to some extent that I got a kick out of it, Did this really need to be released? Probably not, since nobody wanted to in 1973 when it was recorded."
2,The writing is dull,"This book needed a good editor who knew the different between an active and passive voice. The writing is much too flowery for my taste. I spend too much time thinking ""huh?"" and rereading passages. I didn't finish it. Let me, instead, recommend Wolfgang Schivelbusch's A Taste of Paradise."
1,Bad Writing and Worse Editing Spoiled the Story,"The writing in this book was excruciating. The coherence of the story was utterly lost in a lead-footed presentation style that completely disregarded narrative. That's too bad, because one would think the subject would be a fascinating one."
4,The Scents Of Eden,"Great history. Too many errors. On page xxi,Corn writes ""rose in value one hundred percent each time they changed hands-----they changed hands hundreds of times"". Impossible! He probably means,'increased in value hundreds of times'.Even if you start with one penny per pound and increased it 100% just 30 times,you would have ONE BILLION PENNIES! Also 3 different dates relating to same incident. Page 134,line 11,states 1608 Page 135,line1 ,states 1609 Page 137,4th line from bottom,states 1509. This should not be multiple choice. Corn writes about building a fort ""on the other side of the river"",what river? These and other shortcomings interrupted the normal flow of reading. Otherwise,quite informative and exciting story."
5,Turn off the BOOB tube and turn on the BOOBS,"Annie Sprinkles very personal heart felt Spectacular Sex Guide inspires us into our sexual potential giving us the tools for sexual transformation. Even if we already have a satisfying sex life there are many interesting exercises here to try. I can relate to Annie's libraries of sexual experience even though I have not taken as many adventures as her. Really folks if some of us turned off our TVs and used that time to further our sexual awareness there would be a great possibility for personal sexual freedom. My favorite quote would be ""Don't worry; be horny."" Now that this wonderful book has been put on sale there couldn't be a better time to buy it."
3,Fun.,"Annie Sprinkle, Dr. Sprinkle's Spectacular Sex: Make Over Your Love Life with One of the World's Great Sex Experts (Tarcher, 2005)You know you've come to the end of your reviewing rope when you can't think of anything to say about a sex manual. But, well, here I am.It's an enjoyable book, don't get me wrong-- a romp with Annie Sprinkle is always fun. Annie Sprinkle has a perspective on sex that most of us will never achieve (no matter how much we'd like to), and her insights are most welcome. But the book never grabbed me, never slapped me around and said ""you must read me now,"" ending up taking me almost eleven weeks to finish.There's a good deal to like here. The subject, obviously, is sexual self-help for those whose love lives have taken a turn for the boring, and as long as you're willing to buy into some of the more new age-y techniques recommended, there are all sorts of interesting things here to try. Be prepared for a slow read, however. ***"
5,Sexual Superstar or sexually shut down -- this book is for you!,"If you are a sexual superstar you can still learn something from Dr. Annie Sprinkle and if you are sexually shut down this book is also for you. Annie is a sexual genius and a super star ground breaker especially with her performance art as sex education and political awareness.My favorite suggestion involves ""breathing excersizes"" which one can use as a shamanic journey for healing the heart or for strengthing your sexual self. She tells the most hilarous story about dealing with a very noisy neighbor and it is ""O"" ,let us say ,unforgettable and will make you laugh! She encourages ""self loving"" which is good for multi-reasons and one involves sense of smell in a good way! You may cry, you will laugh, most definetely blush a little and raise your IQ, your sexual IQ!"
1,Puritanical Dribble,"The experiential side of the Christian life is left to those who do not share in the Old Calvinists ideals of the Puritan fathers. Of course, we are wrong headed and completely responsible for the lack of morals and the modern landscape of irrelavence in Christianity. Modern thought and any theology this side of the first Great Awakening are anathema that must be thoroughly purged from the pulpits of America so that we can return to the utopian ideals of Wenham and their cloistered Congregationalists babble. I sincerely hope Professor Wells is not as arrogant about the heresies of other less-puritan views of the church's role in our society when he lectures in class. At least he has done me the service of eliminating a possible sight for more research."
3,Slight disappointment,"Tame 1 should have been matched with beats that better meshed with his style, as the J-Zone selections crash on impact, and ""when rappers attack"" seems to redundant for anyone to want to rhyme to. Tame 1 is a dope rapper indeed, and none of the beats ""suck"" per se, but it just isn't notable or outstanding in any way, not fitting for tame's professional delivery."
4,Oil Depot,"I bought this for a friends little boy who loves it, and it makes a nice addition to his collection of Thomes building type things."
1,Quit working the first day!,We bought this because it was only about $35 at Walmart. We wanted something for warming and defrosting. The first day we warmed some frozen vegetables and it shut off. We checked the power and circuit and everything should be working. It finally came back to life late that night or the next day. Its done it two times since so we're taking it back. Save your money!!!!
1,No Henry Ian Cusick,"If you're buying this DVD to see Henry Ian Cusick, as I did... you will be disappointed as this is NOT the show he was in.His was a different ""Dinosaur Hunter"" which was a TV show made and shown only in the UK. That show has been impossible to find."
1,No Henry Ian Cusick in the special,I came to say the same thing. This is NOT the TV movie that stars Henry Ian Cusick. I've let Amazon and IMDb know and they just aren't listening.
2,Blank Generation ripoff only valuable for performance footage.,"The Punk Rock Movie (Don Letts, 1978)As a document of the British punk scene at roughly the same time as Kral and Poe's The Blank Generation, Don Letts' The Punk Rock Movie does have some value. As a movie, it looks a lot like Letts got his hands on a copy of The Blank Generation and decided to copy it as closely as possible. You've seen one, you've seen 'em all, I guess. The only difference here is the bands, and the sound is synced better (which, if you've read my review of The Blank Generation, you'll understand is not meant as a compliment). Not bad for what it is, and the concert footage is, of course, wonderful to see after all these years, but still derivative. **"
3,Still Not Finished ...,"I bought this book almost 7 years ago, at that time I was finishing books of that size in a week tops. However, because the book is so poorly written, has a very slow speed to it, and is very difficult to 'get into' in general, it is still unfinished!Seeing the book as mandatory reading for those interested in Black empowerment, I tried over and over to stomach it, but to no avail, regardless of reading location, time of day, or any other self-directed motivator.Looking at all of the other posts, I'm glad others enjoyed it. I purchased the book to support the cause, and to reward the author for his most powerful works as a Black panther. Please rewrite the book, I'd really like to finish it."
5,An awesome new adventure series for everybody!,"This is a wonderful new book for pre-teens, teens, and adults alike. While written on a middle-school level, the content is mature and edgy enough for adults too. A 12-year-old boy travels the world with his parents investigating spiritual mysteries. Imagine ""The X Files"" and ""Unsolved Mysteries"", but for a younger reader. This book deals with human cloning, but presents it in an exciting and thought-provoking way. Pick up this book and you won't put it down until you're finished! The cute dog named Speagle is a definite bonus!"
4,A good tool to get kids thinking about different issues,I hope it becomes a series. It would be a great way to introduce kids to current ethical issues as well as faith in general.
2,Fine at first,"About 6 months after I bought this thing it crapped out. I loved it at first. The slim size fit into the space that I had, the player worked well with my TV and other equipment, it played every disc I put in it. I was thrilled to have found something this nice... then it died. I was also the stupid fool who didn't send in her warranty card so now I'm looking at a cheaper player, clearly buying the name brands don't help! Why don't they make things to last???"
1,"hate it - terrible sound, disfunctional zoom","This is an extremely poor quality unit. Not worth your money. After a very short time (but too long to return it) the sound got very hissy, taking a *lot* of joy out of watching. The other issues (zoom that doesn't use the whole screen, etc.) pale in comparison."
5,One of my favorite books,"I read this book back in the early 90's and again a couple of years ago and even after many book's before,after and in between,it still remains as one of my favorite's along with and right up there with The Godfather,Jaw's,Gore Vidal's Burr,Sharpe's Rifles,Vince Flynn's earlier books,Alex Berenson's The Faithful Spy and GMF's incomparable Flashman.If you'd like a great historical adventure story that will keep you on the edge of your seat,or a great story about Czarist Russia during the Revolution,this is your book."
4,Let's Rock to the '60s!,"I know what you may be thinking,a 13 year old girl writing a review on a '60s band.It seems my music should probably be about the groups of my music,like the Backstreet Boys and 'Nsync (just to name a few),but ever since my mom and dad saw '60s Invasion two years ago in Hampton Beach,New Hampshire I started to really like ""their""music even more.Last week my parents went back to Hampton Beach and saw '60s Invasion was playing there.My parents immediately bought their c.d.I immediately listened to it.I really loved it!I really loved it because I play in a school band,and to hear that a school band was performing on a c.d. really thrilled me!I also really liked some of the songs that were popular before(like Do Wah Diddy and Wild Thing)redone because I have grown up on those songs.I really appreciate speaking my opinon about a c.d. like this.One day I look forward to actually seeing '60s Invasion live,not just on a c.d. Sincerely, Amanda DiRusso"
4,Feuding Hearts,"Hello, My name is Yvonne Simpson.I am proud of the book that I have written.This is my first and I think that it is a very good romance.Please look for my next books Distant Love, and Distand Conquest,you will love them.thank you, Yvonne Simpsonfor information on upcomming book sighning contact me at:bonji18@concast.net."
4,Perfect for job,This MM-12 Rolatape Measurer was the right tool for the job I had to do. (Measure stake to stake of my property.)The ONLY drawback for me was it is totally made from plastic...By storing properly & using sensibly it should last years though. I would buy it again--just because of its accuracy.
5,Good Product,Great product. Use for appraising and holds up for years. I would reccomend for anyone who needs this tool. Great
3,Great Product - 3 years later (but now 2.5x the price?),"I bought this product 3 years ago and it's still working great. It lives in my car and i use it to measure houses. It goes on wet grass and gets a tad bit muddy on occasion.One thing that's great about it is that in the winter, unlike the larger measuring wheels, I can use it along the side of a house and it doesn't leave a mark (as long as it's clean).On occasion I have needed to reset it, where the numbers stick, but as I said, it gets wet, muddy and it lives in my car with all my home inspection gear. I just reset it and it works just fine.Only thing... I paid 35.50 for it. It's a deal at that price, not at $80+ bucks. That's crazy man. It makes me feel like I'm in back to the future and somebody wants $50 for a coke in the year 2015. ~ A bit exaggerated"
1,DId not last 2 weeks!,"I am a real estate appraiser and I am quite disappointed with this product. Read all the reviews and decided to purchase this brand, but it stopped working after less than 2 weeks! I will not buy this brand again."
5,Outstanding!,"This is a quality product. Don't buy the cheap ones, this is the best we have ever used andfeel it will last. We use them daily and will buy nothing else from now on."
5,Great for gymnastics,These Tuli's really help my daughters heals in gymnastics. If you need heal cushion and cant always wear shoes - then Tuli's are perfect. Plus they also come with a separate heal cushion you can place inside your shoe. Very happy with product!
4,200 Pounds of Fun!,"For Candye Kane fans, I think this is the must have CD. This great Disk, with many styles of music and moods on it are only bettered by seeing her great live act. I have seen her many times in the Seattle WA area and she always impresses....not only with her fabulous body and ""attributes"" but with her wicked talent and singing style!"
5,Great hitch!!!!,"This is a class II receiver and was installed on a Subaru Forester. After a 2-hour installation, you can barely see it. We had my dad's car on ramps and the hitch weighed about 40 lbs. You need 2 people to install it to get the bolts in with ease. My dad loves it and has been buying accessories just so he can use it. The towing capacity is up to 3500 lbs. My truck weight over 6000 lbs and he pulled it with ease in the driveway. The hitch also benefits in rear end collisions as it acts as extra protection for the rear passengers.Great product. It's worth the money."
5,Great Product!,"I have recently installed Curt Hitches on my 2010 Prius and my 2005 Subaru Forester. I did both of the installations myself. Very easy to do, if you have the right tools. They fit perfectly and work great!"
4,easy install hitch,"The hitch arrived very quickly but in a ragged cardboard box. Thankfully, the hardware was well packaged and taped to the main, heavy part of the hitch assembly. From the simple instruction sheet and from looking at the underside of the auto, the installation was fairly straight forward. There were a few issues that caused me to have to trial fit some brackets. Overall, the install only took a couple of hours. Hitch fits well and is not bad looking. Also, the included receiver insert is a bonus, since these usually cost $15 to 20."
4,"Well made, instal it with a friend","The Curt 12038 is a great hitch. It is finished very well and fits discreetly under my 07 Forester. So far it has performed well. I have only used it to carry bikes.I installed it by myself without raising the car. It was a bit of a struggle to hold the weight and bolt it on. A second pair of hands would have made the job a breeze. It took me about 70min. If you are not familiar with the process or the anatomy of your car, make sure you watch a couple of online videos on how to install it. They made the process straight forward. The instructions that come with it are limited and for experienced mechanics."
5,"A solid, well made product --perfect fit.","I installed hitch on my 2004 Subaru Forrester. Biggest problem was a few stubborn, rusted bolts that had to be removed from car frame. If you have an older car -- most likely the bolts are a bit rusty. So, it helped to spray the night before installation with liquid wrench. I did the installation by myself at a very comfortable pace of 2 hrs---absolutely no major problems. I am very pleased with the quality of the product and especially the perfect fit."
3,Not so great Jack,"Bought a set of these and under a load much less than the max recommended the handle broke and the company and Amazon did nothing for me. Product was under warranty but neither answered my request for a RA number. The remaining one works pretty well but I am reluctant to put a load over a few pounds on it. It's a good idea but needs either a better design, higher quality materials, or a more forthright warranty."
3,Great System,"I really like this system, especially for blocking off areas of a finished room to work in and prevent dust from getting everywhere. Very quick and easy to set up and take down and seems well-built. A bit pricey compared to the competition but if you do a lot of construction work, I think it's worth the price."
5,Great for flooring,"I bought a pair to install 500 sq/ft of 5/8 pre-finished bamboo flooring. Like another reviewer said, I have to commend Amazon.com for their service. One arrived damaged, and Amazon.com overnighted a replacement. Kudos to them.The quick clamp feature was good when I had to do a 180 degree turn to square up and install custom tongues, and the jack feature is invaluable for racking the planks when I'm so close to the wall that I can't even use my T&G; pneumatic nailer. They paid for themselves on the first use. A definite must have if you plan to do any serious wood floor installs."
3,"Handle could be stronger, but great service from the manufacturer","I used the JACK to put in some tongue and groove flooring, and it worked great until the last course. I was squeezing the handle (with only one hand) to tighten up the joint when the handle snapped in two.After emailing the manufacturer, they sent out a replacement which I received in about a week.5 stars for customer service, but a product shouldn't break when you're using for something it's designed to do."
4,Pleased with performance,"These jacks work well both to clamp and spread. The way they are designed, allows one to insert the spreading jaws into as little as a 1/4"" of space and then lift or spread them apart. I jack up sagging doors so I can more easily tighten the hinge screws. They are made in China and so the so quality of construction is not superb, I had to send one set back for replacement as the attachment screw for one of the jaws was missing and I couldn't put in a new one as the hole had no threads. I have to commend Amazon.com though because they had a new set shipped out to me in days, even before I sent the old ones back! I tried to jack up my car with one of them, but the plastic handle broke because I put too much force on it, but they replaced that one too, so now I know what their limitations are."
1,Fast Cap Jack,product broke the first time i used it with just hand presure the handles broke on both of them rendering them usless great cocept but not very good quality
3,not what I expected,"the units are a little light duty, less than I expected, however they do everything that they are advertized to do."
3,Good movie,"Chhalia"" is Manmohan Desai's first film, with telltale signs of the emerging showman's narration skills. The story is set around the Partition era when Kewal (Rehman) leaves behind his newly wedded wife Shanti (Nutan) in Lahore, for reasons not divulged to the viewer. Shanti makes it to India a few years later with her little son, in the hope of being reunited with her husband.Kewal is overjoyed to meet his wife and son, but everything goes wrong when the boy introduces himself as ""Anwar"". As for his father's name, he replies ""Abdul Rehman"". Kewal abandons his wife and son. After leaving the boy in an orphanage, Shanti tries to kill herself but is rescued by Chhalia (Raj Kapoor), who shelters her. Chhalia falls in love with Shanti only to learn of her previous marriage and her son."
3,question,"Funny movie. But i 'd like to know what's the title of the song when Queen Latifah (as Charlene) arrives at the golf club dressed in red with a big hat and is about to be presented as ""the nanny"". This song is an oldie but that's all i know about it. If someone knows the title or the band please tell me. Thanks."
5,Great soundtrack!!,I just saw the movie and bought the album. It was off the hook!! Great dance music and it will make you want to bounce!
5,Great movie/Great Soundtrack,I saw the movie this weekend I thought it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I loved the music in the movie and love the soundtrack
2,Plastic Visible Man,"I got this product for my 6-year old grandson. I believe it will be useful for him to understand anatomy. However, you will need glue and several colors of paint to complete the contruction of this item. The plastic parts will need some cleaning of thin strip of plastic overflow in the molds. They parts, thus, do not seem high quality. The body does not go together well, especially the chest plate. Useful product, but definitely not high quality. Some assembly is definitely required."
1,Trash,"I completely agree with other reviewers, this is absolutely unusable. Parts don't fit together, no paint or glue included, and instructions don't make sense. At the end, I couldn't figure out how to assemble it, so it is still in a box sitting on my shelf. Good thing I bought this at a yard sale for $1.Total trash!"
1,Worst. Purchase. Ever.,"Absolutely horrid. One of the worst purchases I've ever made. I bought this piece of garbage (literally, as I've just thrown it out) at the Body Worlds exhibit and it is HORRIBLE. The pieces are poorly made and do not fit together. The instructions are terrible. The quality of the plastic is cheap, and the pieces all have to be sanded in order to take off LOTS of extra plastic. The pieces, once again DO NOT FIT TOGETHER. What a terrible, tedious, unusable piece of garbage. Worthless. DO NOT BUY."
2,"Educational, but not worth the frustration","I got this for my 13 yr old son who is really into anatomy. It has been one load of frustration. It says it's for 10 and up, but neither him, my 15 yr old or I have had much luck putting it together. The parts don't fit well where they're supposed to snap together and the holes where ""pins"" are put in are so large the pins fall through. The directions for the skeleton were OK, but when it came to putting the organs inside the directions weren't as clear as they should be. We finally scrapped the whole thing, although the book about anatomy that came with it is interesting. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who's not extremely patient putting things together."
1,Falsely Advertised as all regions,This will not work in region 1. You must order the DVD version to watch in region 1. I had to return this.
1,unable to play this DVD,I PURCHASED THIS BLUE RAY FOR MY NEPHEW WHO LOVES DINOSAURS AND FOUND OUT AFTER PURCHASE THAT IT IS UNABLE TO BE PLAYED ON US FORMATTED DVD PLAYERS. THE DESCRIPTION DID NOT SPECIFY THIS ACCURATELY. UNFORTUNATELY SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON A DVD THAT CAN'T BE VIEWED AND DEALT WITH A DISAPPOINTED NEPHEW.
1,not for north america,"The discs are for region B(blu-ray) and 2(DVD), none can be played by player for North America region. The descriptions should be clear about it."
1,planet dinosaur,this item was purchased on 12/9/2011 as a christmas gift the day after christmas we went to watch it and it will not play it is telling us that the encryption code is not formatted for our blu ray player i have tried it in others with the same result. very disappointed spent a lot of money for dvd we can not use
5,"Product does not work on USA players despite being ""all regions""","The product was purchased by me on april 28th and it seemed to be fine, until I put in my PS3.Honestly im a little ticked the disc was said to be an ""ALL REGION"" format ,but when I received the product it said it was only ""REGIONS 2&4"".Now being in a REGION 1 area you can see where a REGION 2 and REGION 4 blu-ray can be a problem for me."
5,Wonderful Christian perspective on OCD!,This book gives an insightful Christian perspective on OCD. It shows how biblical truths can help OCD sufferers overcome their struggles by helping them to trust the Lord and rest in His care. It is very encouraging and gives real hope!
1,too many errors and misconceptions,I am very displeased with this book. Many errors in figures and equations. Section 4.2.2 is fundamentally in error.
5,This book is a good value.,"As an undergraduate student in Electronic Engineering, I am fortunate to study Radio Frequency theory using this book.""RF Circuit Design"" is clearly structured as an undergraduate text, but should also serve as a professional reference. It explains RF theory in detail. You get exactly what you need to know and a lot of other topics that are hi-tech, all of them with practical examples.This book is a good value. Not only it is well written, but it also includes a CD with software support for the material covered in the book."
3,Not a stand-alone text,"Ok text, but not the best. Plenty of good examples are provided, but there isn't enough theory or explanation associated with them. It's not good to try and mimic a worked problem without a proper understanding of the technique used or the principles behind it. I find myself constantly referencing other texts to make sense of this one (undergrad/grad course). I'm not sure what the options are, but there's got to be something a bit better than this. Pozar's text on microwave engineering was of significantly better quality (although it cannot be used to replace this one)."
3,Another Caution for E-10 users.,"There isn't a lot of information on this. Olympus advises caution on the type of Power Supply you use on the Camedia E-10. This PS is designed to use with all Olympus cameras, but when you get the package, it explaines that it's for all Olympus cameras that use 2AA type batteries. And even that is an afterthought. The original blister pack has 4AA batteries, but it's been taped over with the 2AA label. I'm sure it's a good unit, but not for the E-10. That's the only reason for the 3 stars."
3,"Although this is fine, There is a better option.","This does the job fine, exactly what it should do. but it only saves you a minute of juice while you download your images. If this is important to you, you can get a very good card reader for only $15 that will not only read your cards but any future cards you might have if you get another camera or have a second camera with different media. As of now you can get the San Disk 8 in 1 reader for $15 or the 12 in one for $25, They hook to your USB. 8in 1 should be suffficient for every common card type."
1,Does not work,I ordeer the Adapter and it worked for maybe 24 hours and then it died. i was wondering if the company I ordered it from can send me a replacement and a return box so i can send them this one as it should have some sort of warranty on it.
4,Sweet book!,"This is one of those books that makes you cry; not because it's sad, but because it's so sweet. It's the first of a four book series. I'm thankful that I did not stumble upon this author, or series, until all the books were released. I enjoy going straight to the next book without having to wait months in between books. Well worth the read."
4,Happy Light Read,"I liked it and read it in one day. It's a Christian romance about family and hospitality. Three siblings whose mother died after moving to California from Hawaii and whose father went back to mission work in Hawaii but left kids in the states with the intent to join them later have to make it on their own with the help of Christian friends. This I thought was strange. Katie, the oldest, gets a teaching job and takes care of her teen brother Sean and little sister, Marcail."
2,"Same story, different town","I first read the Yellow Rose Trilogy which I loved!!! That is why I bought the California series. I am giving this 2 stars not because it isn't a good book. It would have been a good book if I hadn't read the Yellow Rose Trilogy first. This is more of the same. Boy meets girl. Won't admit their love. Share a common faith. Finally admit they love each other. The only thing different is the names and the town!! Lori Wick is an excellent author and I share her faith in Christ. I just feel this is ""more of the same""."
2,decent,Iceberg slim books pimp and mama black widow are among the greatest pieces of literature I have ever read.This however is ok and only because I respect the story telling of this man.Broadway sam is the best on this album the rest are average.Unless you love the work of slim don't waste your money.
1,"Chintzy, poorly engineered","I wish I had read the reviews on this before purchase. I have purchased nearly every appliance in the kitchen from Kitchen Aid (including the oven and stove). This was foolish to go by the product based on brand name with little research. It is somewhat obvious to me that this product went through zero testing before they went production with it.I concur with the other reviews with the issues, primarily it does not toast correctly; it 'dries' bread rather than toasts it. The tray within the unit is a major safety issue, if you pull it out any more than say 55% it falls out, and that includes whatever load you may have on it.I didn't purchase this product from [...] but it sucks so bad I actually decided to log in and write this review. I'm not stretching the truth by saying that the standard $[...] black and decker will get you through many years with much less aggravation."
1,Large Disappointment,"I used it about three times before I had to return it to the store. The entire over would get hot, including the glass of the front door. The oven rank would slide on its own and fall on the open glass door, spilling all my food...d'oh! The heat was also very weak; it took ten minutes to cook what it takes three minutes on the stove. I was so disappointed because it looked sturdy and I have good luck with their other products."
5,Red KitchenAid Toaster Oven,"I had looked everywhere for a red toaster oven, and did not have very many to pick from. After reading several reviews on each one, I decided to buy the KitchenAid. I am very pleased with my decision. It is slightly larger than the previous toaster oven, but it really love it. It is great. Easy to use, and I like the large handle to open the door."
4,"Great, but doesn't fit all cribs","I live in Korea and have a standard size crib. I purchased this online in the states and brought it back to Korea. We were using regular crib bumpers on our ""standard"" size crib. Unfortunately, the cribshield doesn't exactly fit. We ended up leaving the longer crib bumpers on and putting the crib shields over those. Because the crib shields on the shorter sides were falling down, we've just removed them. Despite that, it works really well. My daughter doesn't get her legs stuck in the crib rails (a previous problem without bumpers) and she still has some ""protection"" from the crib bumper without the risk of her climbing out of the crib because the crib shield blocks any support. It works for us!"
3,Good for book collectors,"I purchased Collie Concept as it was a recommendation from the Collie Club of America. In reading other reviews for this book I took someone's advice and ordered the hard covered version for more colorful pictures. I did not find the pictures so much more brillant most likely being an older published book. It's a good collectors item for your book shelve or someone who is interested in breeding this breed. It reviews so very much of the Collie Standards, showing and breeding info. I myself was simply looking for information about this breeds character and temperment and in the area of what to expect from your new dog/Collie; not breeding info. For the amount of money I paid for this book and it not be a reference book for me was kind of wasteful. I really haven't seen anything in it that will be of use to me and my dog. I had to order a ""used"" book as out of publication I believe; it came in the excellent condition as stated it was in."
4,Interesting Twist on History,Read this author's other books and ended up reading this one. She again takes a place I know about today and brings out the past that I just did not think of. The story is set in a WWII though in the US. It starts with the fact that NAZI subs were patrolling our coast and threatened our boats and ships. Then it twists into making us think that wars between nations may not really need to be wars between people.
4,Mid 60's George Jones,"In the mid-60's George Jones recorded a tribute album to Bob Wills and Hank Williams. This was his 2nd tribute to Hank in that decade. This CD condenses those 2 albums. You get 7 songs from each. Liner notes are good as is the sound. And Jones' voice is in prime shape. The worst I can say for this CD is that it could've been paced better. It ends with 5 straight Wills songs. The compilers should've mixed things up better. But if you're a Jones fan, then this is a good bargain."
3,"Good, but not very complete","This was good for a quick overview of duck care (which I needed), but after I was done I found myself needing more information."
5,"Read the intro and epilogue, then decide","The negative reviewers did not read page 13 of the intro? ""We wrote this book to help fans..discover how the rich fabric of Tolkien's fantasy ENHANCES a Christian understanding of our real world...It is not..a covert allegory of the gospel."" This book is a series of reflections on how the story parallels other timeless real and fictional stories and how we might apply the points. It is encouraging to someone who has not delved into the bible but can can get their mind around Tolkien. It might pique curiosity enough to get them to crack a bible open. On the other hand, I can also say it is very encouraging to someone who is not a reader of fantasy at all. It has opened the world of that genre which I have ignored. I've noticed that some people are afraid of the ""darkness"" in that genre for themselves or kids. This book will help help them understand the point and be more comfortable with that."
1,find god in tolkien???,the idea of finding god in tolkiens works is absolutely ridiculous. if tolkien knew such a work of literary garbage existed using the title of his books he would roll over in his grave. don't waste your money.
2,Maybe for nervous parents?,"I rate this book with two stars only because, as an apologetic directed to Christian parents who may be nervous about content in LOTR that mentions ""magic"" and occult-like situations, I think ""Finding God"" succeeds in providing insight into the actual ethical and even godly applications of Tolkien's themes.David Zampino's review stated: ""There were also the odd factual error (which only a Tolkien trivia buff like myself would notice) which should have been caught by the authors or the editors.""I think Mr. Zampino underestimated other Tolkien fans. I was so disappointed in the number of factual errors that for me the authors' credibility was compromised. I often found myself doubting whether the authors had really read LOTR in-depth or just skimmed it to pick up enough background to set the scenes for their own material."
2,A Mere Scratch on the Surface,"This is an incredibly disappointing ""work."" Any true reader of Tolkien will marvel at the shallowness of this critique of his trilogy. I wonder if the authors did any more than peruse the book or, at best, speed-read through it to write this drivel. God is indeed present in Tolkien's work but this book is no road map to finding Him there. Far superior is ""The Gospel Acording to Tolkien"" by Ralph C. Wood. I would also suggest that serious readers pick up the Tolkien's ""Silmarillion"" in which God's act of creation literally leaps off the first page. Bruner and Ware would also do well to read this to deepen their own knowledge."
3,Decent Commentary,"If you're looking for an explaination of how Tolkien's Christian beliefs are shown in his work this isn't really what you want. I enjoyed the book, but it didn't need the Lord of the Rings slant in order to be written. The author captures basic beliefs of Christianity and connects them to scenes found within the books. It was a nice book that didn't take long to read and just made me reflect upon my Christian beliefs."
2,Inconvenient Catholicism,"Additional comment for reviewer of Jan. 31, 2004, from Tolkien's own words:""The Lord of the Rings is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work."" (Tolkien, in a letter to Robert Murray)And in response to this book's publication: For a book to call itself ""Finding God in LotR"", and then to blatently ignore the inconvenient fact that Tolkien was an unabashed Catholic in a time & place where it was professionally and socially unpopular to be so, removes this book from making any claims to factual or critical authenticity, and slides it into propaganda-land."
2,Ho Hum,"Well, I dunno. This is a nicely written but ultimately deeply flawed attempt to find religious meaning in a morally deep but ultimately unreligious book. Brunner and Ware dont get too trapped in dogma but dont dig up any illuminating truths either. Tolkien was a Christian and the trilogy is about responsibility and morality - It doesnt take a rocket scientist to pull out the comparisons to born-again, american-evangelist Christianity.In the end it all comes down to typical religious circular reasoning. If you belive in an omnipresent God or Gods, youll find him/her/it/them in LOTR and/or reflections on his/her/its/their teachings in the text.Worth reading but not worth believing in"
2,Disappointment,"""Finding God in Lord of the Rings"" should be retitled ""Reading Things into Lord of the Rings.""The entire book, although generally well-written, is filled mostly with assumptions and badly-supported interpretations.I don't recommend this book."
1,Spoiler alert,"This book just stole your money. Lord of the rings is a fantastic classic story loved by millions and it has many deep rooted meanings, but your god isn't one of them sorry."
2,"Not a Literary Study, but a Devotional Book","I was very disappointed with this tiny book. I had expected a literary study of Christian themes, the relation between myth and truth, Christ imagery, how prayer works in the books, etc. Instead, what I found was a series of brief chapters in which the authors spend a couple pages rehashing some aspect of the story, then a couple more offering a devotional application to our own lives. This might be suitable for family worship if everyone in the family has seen the movie, but it's of no use to me. To others interested in this Christian themes, I recommend ""Tolkien: Author of the Century"" and another little book on ""Virtues"" in ""Lord of the Rings,"" the exact title of which escapes me."
3,Silver Apples - 'Decatur' (Whirly Bird),"'Decatur' is totally different from any other Silver Apples release.One track,JUST one track that clocks in at 42:10.All instrumental.Some decent oscillator sounds combined with nice drum work and coronal keyboard drone is to be experienced here.Line-up:Simeon-keyboards&oscillators,Xian Hawkins-keyboards and Michael Lerner-drums.Personally,I liked their 'Silver Apples/Contact' 2-lp's-on one disc and 'Beacon' efforts better.See my reviews of both."
3,Functional with a tweak or two,"I was looking for something on which to hang my Les Paul, and this works well with a couple of tweaks.- The item comes with two screws and drywall anchors, but on the mount itself the screw holes do not go all the way through to the back. I had to drill the holes through.- This is a nit, but the holes are too widely spaced for both to fit onto a wall stud. Not a big deal since the kit comes with drywall anchors, but I still mounted one half of the mount onto the center of a wall stud.- The third is kind of my fault..I wasn't confident with the thickness of the screws provided to support my guitar, and since I was drilling one into a stud anyway I used a slightly larger screw. When I drilled the screw through the hole the entire mount snapped in half. I fixed it with some epoxy and the wood finish is such that it looks new.The mount serves its purpose well though and it looks good in my den."
5,Chino is the best,"I bought this CD 3 days ago, and it hasn't been off since then. It's on in the car, when I wake up, and when I go to sleep at night. And all the times between. My favorite tracks are 9 and 14, which is a collaboration with a Sex Styled Kool Keith. 14 might actually be the most fun to listen to, since Keith is so entertaining in his perversions. But the album is great. My biggest question is: WHERE IS THIS GUY NOW? This album came out in 96. Before that was the Art of Origins stuff, and I have no idea what that is or where to find it, but after that.... nothing. Is there anyone out there who knows if Chino's still in the rap game? I hope so. He's ingenius."
5,the best,"Easily the most under-rated hip hop artist of all time. People are saying how ill of a lyricist that he is, but you guys don't even know. You think you discover what some of his metaphors mean but they most likely have deeper meanings than what you thought. His beats are perfect. This was 1996, and the beats sound really good, with a dark sound that fits his voice perfectly. His new release ""I told you so"" is a lot better, but only because of much better production and its 4 years later, but for the time, this cd is definetely a classic, and its worth anyone buying. Buy it now"
1,Saying Chino XL is average is an overstatement,"Chino XL has no right to even say Tupac's name in his music. He is nowhere near Tupac's league. If you are a fan of Tupac then you will not support Chino XL one bit. I know i never will. I wont even download his music for free, it would be a waste of space on my computer."
1,THIS IS [bad] AND DON'T! BELIEVE ALL THESE OTHER PEOPLE,Y'all wat up people listen up this is [bad] this S.U.C.K.S. big time i just bought it because of 2pac cause they were dissing each other so i figured why don't i get this see what the fuss is about but i heard it and then i thought it was only about 5 words about 2pac and this WHOLE ALBUM REALLY IS A WASTE OF MONEY..DO NOT BUY IT!!
5,STOP ACTING ON SHOWS LIKE RENO 911 and JUST BE AN EMCEE!!,"I ain't mad at Chino for gettin' his paper, but you are one of the most talented mc's breathing, and this solo debut proves it. Please bless us again with a third classic cd, mr. Barbosa!"
5,WHERE ARE IS CHINO XL? WHO IS CHINO XL?,THIS MOST BE THE MUST KEEP SECRET IN THE RAP GAME I HEARD CHINO BACK IN 96 AND TO SAY THAT HE NEVER GOT NO LOVE ON THE RADIO AND IN VIDEOS IS F**K UP I NEVER HEARD NO ONE LIKE HIM OR EVEN COME CLOSE TO HIM NO WONDER PAC WAS JEALOUS.
4,Underrated!,"This album was tight, no doubt about that. The beats were tight, no doubt about that. He is wayyyy to slept on. What ticks me off is when people talk mess about him just because 2pac did. If people were to actually give him a spin, he's a great MC. The only thing that I don't like about him is that he uses the word ""LIKE"" a little too much. He's great otherwise."
5,Best rap album of all time,"I have had this CD for about 3 years now and aint played it out yet. Simply put, this is the best album of all time. I cant wait for Chino to bless us one more time this fall when he drops ""Chi"" on Warner Bros."
4,It is what it is,"This is the 30th Anniversary of Dungeons and Dragons collector set of dice. It contains 1d4(black), 4d6(red), 1d8(blue), 1d10(green), 1d12(yellow), 1d20(orange), and one percentile(purple). I prefer my dice to be put into sets of one color or style, so that I can easily and quickly hand out a complete set to each player. However, they are good quality dice, and will work well for any player. This set also comes with a dice bag. The bag is black with red trim and has the D&D logo embroidered in red on it. The bag is small, won't fit more in it than the dice it comes with. If you're a player who needs his/her own set, or a dm who would like an extra set to hand out to a player at your next game, this works. However, you can probably get just as good of a set for cheaper at your local gaming store."
1,An excellent waste of $9.99 plus shipping,"Sure, you need a set of polyhedral dice to play D&D. But these are the most bland-looking dice I've ever seen -- and the vinyl dice bag is ugly to boot. Both the Basic D&D set and the Player's Kit contain a set of dice, and they're better bargains as well. (The Basic Set contains a set of these bland dice. The Player's Kit contains a set of premium dice. Neither contain a dice bag.) And, of course, you can go to your local hobby shop and select your own dice for less than ten dollars."
3,DIce to a great game,The Dice are ok for me. I would recomend that you go to a magazine store or a wizard cost game shop and purchase your dice there. but if your like me here in Iraq is understandable to go this route.
4,Seemed okay,"I bought these as a gift. They came quickly in a little pouch. They seemed of good quality..the packaging could have been better, but on the whole they looked decent.."
4,Essentials,Dice are an essential for Dungeons and Dragons. My son and his friends couldn't find the specialized dice in local stores so they made their own out of paper. I do not think I need to mention how poorly these dice worked (though it was a great lesson in geometric solids). We found these dice on Amazon and they have changed the reliability of the randomness of the boys' games in a good way.The dice are sturdy and come with a short explanatory pamphlet to guide use of the dice in gaming.
1,Too expensive,For what you get this item is too expensive. You can get the same number of dice plus an additional percentile dice for $2-3 less in most places. This is not worth the price with all the options for getting your dice from another source.
1,Dead on Arrival,"This cable was very inexpensive. I should have known that it would not work. The cabe itself is a very cheap made in China product, with very thin (small gauge)cord. Even if the cable did work, I doubt that it would have been able to work properly over 15 ft given the limitations on data transmission created by the very thin wire gauge."
1,Not good,I was expecting something easy to use.Manul doesn't help at all.Picture is small on tv and not clearFit to tv doesn't work.Please let me know how can I return this item.
2,"OK case, but it's really brown, not tan. (Updated)","This case is OK -- I didn't have any problems with the strength of the magnetic closure. The main problem with it is that the case is not really tan in color, as pictured. The case that I received was more brown in color -- in my opinion, quite ugly. The quality of the leather & stitching is fine & the clip is sturdy. Based on the color discrepancy, I gave it 2 stars.UPDATE -- It appears that the picture for the product has been updated, and the one showing now is accurate of the product that I received. A good reflection on the seller, just wish it would have been done before I spent my money! I would have chosen a different product. With an accurate picture, I would give it 4 out of 5 stars."
5,premium tan leather pouch for RAZR V3 cell phone,"I am very pleased with the product. It was in perfect condition when it arrived. It looked exactly like it did in the picture and my husband was very pleased with this gift. i got this order very quickly, infact it came sooner than I had expected. I will do further business with this company."
3,"Great Case, but Not for Samsung T809","I purchased this case for my T809, and though it's a well-constructed, sharp-looking case (I love the magnetic closure), it really isn't made for this Samsung phone. If all you plan to do is carry the phone in this case, it's okay, but if you plan to use the MP3 player's headphones, or wish to charge the phone without removing the case, this product won't work for you."
3,Not what i expected,After reading the description and looking at the outside of the box the contents looked nothing like the photo on the box.
2,visible woman,"opened it and realized it's like a model car. it has to be assembled, glued, and painted. didnt use it."
1,Not Worth the Aggravation,"I wanted a straightforward slide scanner to scan my 6000 slide collection, and from the reviews, this appeared to be a slam dunk. Perhaps I was pre-disposed to this being a great product. But after several hours of trying to get the software set up and multiple crashes of my standard Windows XP system, I'm giving up. This is going back to the dealer. The software is not at all intuitive, and is very clunky. My one last effort of scanning a slide resulted in a ""post-processing error"" and terminated the slide scan.Maybe if you're a professional and/or have all day to tinker, this it can be made to work. But I have a day job, am very computer literate, but can't devote 30 or 40 hours to getting this up and running without crashing my system (assuming that it would eventually run properly)."
1,Ms. Nita M.,"I am very disappointed in the quality of the scan with scanner.It continues to have straight line scratch through my film and very dirty. My old scan was slow but clean and never do I have scratched film. Did Nikon go wrong with this one or did I get a lemon. Also, time is soooooo much longer than advertised."
4,Great Scanner,"On July 19, I gave this scanner one star and wrote:""Film strip adapter was DOA right out of the box. The scanner goes back to the store tomorrow, and if the new one works I'll change my rating.""I returned the non-working scanner for another one, which works perfectly. Set up was easy, and I didn't have to refer to the manual too often to use the Nikon Scan software. Scans are stunning! I feel like I got a great deal considering this is Nikon's cheapest scanner."
1,INCOMPATIBLE WITH NEW MAC'S!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have been a Nikon Super CoolScan 4000 user for years and those years have been filled with anxiety and pain.The reason? I choose to use Mac computers. I hear the same from Mac Users who have made the mistake of buying the CoolScan V. Take my informed advice Nikon could not care less for us. They have never had a driver for the Mac that works well.SUMMARY: NIKON HAS NO COMPATIBLE DRIVER FOR NEW MAC COMPUTERS (as of 8/2007). AND ANY PAST DRIVERS WERE ONLY PARTIALLY COMPATIBLE WITH NON-INTEL MAC.CONCLUSION: DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE MAC COMPUTERS.
5,Excellent Scanner to Convert Your Collection,"I purchased this scanner to digitize my color negatives with the intention of selling it when finished. Set up was easy. Results are good to excellent depending on negative condition. I leave ICE and scan image enhancer on all the time and the result is pretty good. Scan time is about 10 minutes per 4 pic negative with setting at medium. Average file size for jpeg is about 3.5MB. It wont work miracles, but it does a pretty good job on negatives that are were in storage for years. If I can resell it while retaining 75% of what I paid for it, then it will be well worth the effort. It's a slow slow process.. If you have thousands of slides or negatives I would suggest a faster unit. If you have a few thousand or less, then this is ideal... I give it a 5 star because it does exactly what it was designed to do with good to excellent results.. On occasion with ICE on you will get a miracle out of it.. turning a very damaged negative into a pretty nice image."
3,Scanner,"Works ok, labor intensive. Kinda clunky the way it works. Not an easy process, very time consuming. this is a winter project when you have a bunch of time to make the copies. Not the best quality of images but for the very old slide I am converting this is not an issue."
4,Good Choice for scanning Negatives,"It works rather well, and its not too slow. I do not like the Nikon Software it came with, as it was a little limited. I opted to use Vuescan instead, for its added features. Otherwise If you have any 35mm single frame negatives - best get the extra adapter, as it will not take them otherwise. Good quality scans. Happy customer."
4,A good way to change slides to digital,I am pleased with the Nikon Coolscan. It is a good way to turn my slides to digital and it also gives me the opportunity to adjust any colors that have been lost over the years. Good job.
1,old operating system,We sent it back because it runs on an old operating system. Not what we were looking for and they charge you to send it back a restocking fee stay away from this company
4,Nikon Film Scanner - Great Product,"Love It! While not a easy as people will make you believe, it is a great product to turn old Slides and Film Strips into digital images. Beware it is time consuming...can take 1 to 5 minutes to make a slide into an image, but it is great to share with family when done. A little pricy, but if you have old slides/film, it is recommonded for the software that corrects a lot of problems."
1,Beware!,"You may have trouble if you have an intel Mac. The Nikon Scan 4 software is old. I really mean it, it's years old. Nikon obviously have no interest in this product. Boththe scanner and it's software."
5,I'll never use a flat-bed scanner again,"Until now I've been scanning with a flat-bed. I cannot believe how much better the images look coming out of the Coolscan. Someday I may upgrade to a Coolscan 9000, but I will never bother with a flatbed again. And Digital GEM is excellent at removing grain.My only real gripe is that there is no way to scan an entire roll at a time."
4,"I love it, but...","I have a collection of slides and negatives that I want digitized so I can enjoy them. I am computer literate and with the purchase of this scanner I now have 3 scanners (flatbed, dedicated document scanner and a negative/slide scanner).There are 2 drawbacks to this scanner:a) it's very slow. I recommend multitasking while scanning. (I'm on the internet surfing, but I have 2 Gig of ram on the PC.)b) if you are going to scan large format negs or want multiple strips, better go look at what Epson has got. I found out later there's a model that has a way of putting in 4-6 strips to scan AND it'll go scan directly into Photoshop.Would I change? I don't know. I'm satisfied with what I got. It's doing the job and personally I don't want to tweak every negative or slide in Photoshop. I would rather be selective because I'd never get anything done if I didn't. It's a very time intensive process as it is."
4,Still available elsewhere at MSRP,"The coolscan V ED has been discontinued with no evident replacement in sight. As such, they are getting hard to find and the price seems to be going up (ie Adorama). You can still get them from Bestbuy for MSRP, plus tax and $6.00 shipping. Not such a bad deal. I may still opt for the 5000 and return my V that is en route. Any thoughts?? Actual review to follow.UPDATE: Returned this scanner and got the 5000 with the F-210 batch scanner. So far, so good. Tracking resale prices on E-bay makes spending more to get the 16 bit scanner seem worth the price differential. The scans of some of my older slides are just simply breathtaking. Hope this helps."
4,Good results,"It takes a lot of time to scan each slide and then improve the old dark ones in PhotoShop Elements (much better than the picture editing software that comes with the scanner) but the results are worth it. I get some reading done while doing the scanning, then run all the images through Photoshop. It's great that I can set the scanner to output in almost any format--.tiff, .jpg, etc. The ""ICE"" works great at removing the dust and age marks. I'm digitizing a huge collection of family photos, some more than 50 years old. The digital images look better than the originals and will print better, too.I had a little trouble at the beginning, but starting over and re-installing the scanner software solved the problem--must have been an error on my part. Unfortunately, you do have to install the Nikon photo-editing software as well as the scanner software even if you use only the latter, but today's computers have so much memory that it's not a problem."
4,Good equipment,"The scanner is a great product. Only thing I regret is that it doesn't have the multiple pass scanning like the Nikon CoolScan 5000 has. But other than that feature, the two scanners are pretty much on par with the 5000 only being a few seconds faster. The V ED is great, though, good quality scans and quick. Well worth the money."
5,Wonderful book about this movie!,"This is a great book for lovers of the original Willy Wonka movie with Gene Wilder. For me and my family, there's no substitute! (We don't even want to watch the Johnny Depp version, even though we like him as an actor). Good condition and shipped promptly."
4,"Simple, but covers all the hard to find things","I use this dictionary to clear up with students in my class the hard to find words to do with measurements that they can't seem to grasp. This dictionary covers it all. Things like ""net tonnage"" and ""gross tonnage"" are explained in short and simple terms like nowhere else. Recommend having it available to anyone who doesn't know all the confusing math, but wants to know what the various thousands of words to do with measurement mean."
5,Arithmetic 5 work Text Teacher Edition,"Great teaching book, would be more helpful if all the problems solution explanations. Sometime had problems with explaining problems in detail, but overall was able to accomplish the task."
4,I liked it! ^_^,with the original sound effects (at least in my version) it has a very nice storyline and the art is very nice! elegable for thke whole family to watch and read ^_^
4,Review of Targus TLT007 15.4 Elegant Leather Tote - Black,"Great looking, very professional but a little heavier since it's leather. My last bag was a Samosonite with similar design but it was nylon and that was very comfortable and light but didn't look as great as this Targus. Also the handles are leather and in a round shape instead of flat so not as comfortable if you've loaded the bag up. Overall this is a great bag and I love using it."
2,Poor quality,"It is sad because a week ago, I would have given this bag 4 stars. I have only used it for about three weeks, partially filling it will light snacks to take to work and carrying it from the car to the building and back. That is all the wear it took for one of the handles to tear--yes, that is right--TEAR. You can see the material beneath the ""leather"" now. The handles are rounded, but as I don't fill the bag with anything heavy, it hardly bothers my shoulder. The tear on the other hand is a deal breaker for me. Why pay more money for leather if it is just going to tear so easily anyway? I'm ordering a replacement bag today--but not a Targus one! Other than those issues, it is an attractive tote bag, but mine does not stand well on its little metal feet and constantly falls over. Maybe I just got a dud. Good luck!"
1,Not impressed,there aren't many options for CSET science study books out there. This one was overpriced and had a ton of errors/inaccuracies!
3,Challenging,"This is a record that I bought because I was intrigued by the cover. I had no idea what I was getting. I'm a big fan of the jazz singers and standards.Her voice is tremendous.The songs are where the challenge lies. You've almost got to concentrate to hear what makes this music special. It doesn't just grab you, like for instance Frank singing ""Fly Me to the Moon""."
3,"Slow, Out-of-Date, Great Size/Weight","At the time we purchased, this was about the only reasonably priced small, lightweight external hard drive available.It works as promissed, but the driver extensions weren't bundled with it and we had a hard time getting them from the manufacturer.If you're looking to buy now (2007), look for something that uses the newer USB 2.0 as this one is quite slow with USB 1.0."
1,trophy hunter who?,"The arrows were incomplete when I got them and only half of them stayed together. The rest just fell apart. I'll never buy these again, or from the people I bought them from."
1,not too bad..,"i take back what i said, my uncle bought these arrows a long time ago and said they were good. mine however broke, BUT, the sportsman guide offered to refund me 12 brand new ones and pay for shipping if i would simply send them my broken ones. i was pleased with the sincerity of the employees who i spoke too. these arrows dont come with field points but fly extremely straight and hit like bricks. like i said again, sketchy arrows, BUT THE SPORTSMAN GUIDE MADE MY EXPIERENCE WITH THEM 1000 TIMES BETTER! THANKS GUYS!"
5,Best book in the world next to the Holy Bible,I read this book for the first time over 25 years ago. I was convinced in my heart of its truth and have found these truths repeatedly confirmed year after year. I have also found that many of the basic truths found in this wonderful book have been taught throughout Christian history but have been called heresy by the orthodox or mainstream. The truths are here. Read this book and ask God to guide you about whether this book was written by His direction.
1,"great band, horrible comeback","This bands first two albums and ""third"" album the Garden are must haves for any psychedelic/weird/electronic/drone music fan. Absolutely genius. I am a huge fan of this band and have done some silly things to prove it but I have to admit this is a travesty. If you're new to Silver Apples, hell-even if you're their biggest fan ever-I would never ever suggest this album. I don't know what Simeon was thinking or even if he was but this is just a terrible LP. The best thing about this record is the album cover and that is prettywful too. However you cannot go wrong with S/T, Contact, or the Garden."
4,Wonderful contemporary-fantasy quest,"This is the 2nd best Blaylock I've read (best: The Last Coin) and has all the classic Blaylock plot elements: an assortment of quirky characters in a northern California backwater, and a mystic treasure with its aging guardians pitted against the bizarre machinations of a grotesque, eccentric villian. Nothing like fast-paced action but a marvellous unfolding of plots and characters."
1,junk,"The first edition was released through the Science Fiction Book Club. It is a boring, tearse, dreary read. Imagine if Edgar Allen Poe and H.P. Lovecraft were working together with (assistance from P.K. Dick for scenery) to produce a novel to put people to sleep. Every once in a while, something mildly interesting might show up to be a plot point, but then the book completely ignores it until much later. I gave up on the book, and didn't bother to finish it, something I almost never do. Save your time and money."
4,Take Me to My Friend,"I remember reading this book when I was in the 8th grade. I remember really enjoying it. I recently found a copy at a second hand store and am reading it again. I forgot alot about it, but I find I still like the book. Would recommend it for any teen who loves to read. A nice light read for an adult between heavier volumes."
4,Musical magic,The Little Belle and Price dolls are high quality and durable for little kids. The costumes are made very well and can last through hours of play. The only thing I wish they could of done differently is to have Belle and the Beast sing a song from the Disney movie instead of the song they sing together. Although it's cute - my little girl wanted to hear Belle sing like she did in the show. Overall though a great product!
5,One of the best Noir ever,"One of the best mystery novels ever written, The Far Cry maintains a uniquely low-key, realistic tone, with the dead woman acquiring an increasingly haunting presence in the main character's solitary existence. Fredric Brown was a classic mystery writer, but I don't think he was ever more subtle and fascinating than in this book. A traditional reprint would be wonderful. I would also love to see a Kindle edition."
1,Waste of Time,"I know this is only $30 but the level of quality is so poor. They really should have hired a professional to make this DVD. The spend too much time on the DVD actually detailing the car and they don't explain what they're doing. You can quickly show me how to vacuum, but I don't need to watch you doing it for 20 minutes.I would not buy this DVD"
5,The perfect case for my little notebook.,"It is not easy finding a case small enough for Sony's smallest notebook computers. So, I wasn't surprised that Sony made small protective cases. I purchased the case for my Sony T250 notebook computer and it fits perfectly. My computer is well-cushioned and safe."
3,"Beautiful, Tragic, woefully disappointing","To second the opinion of one reviewer, those who enjoyed ""White Teeth"", Zadie Smith's first novel, will be very unhappy with this. While the book attains eloquence and frequently beauty it leaves us with a hunger for...more. More character development (a la WT) more characters, a flowing and wild plot that seems to be heading somewhere while retaining a sense of its place in reality. Anything really resembling White Teeth is lacking. While this book is quite interesting and great it is not White Teeth. It is subdued and borderline boring. If you've yet to read ""White Teeth"" and are considering this instead I implore you, buy White Teeth and wait until Ms. Smith releases something else, her talent will prevail it's just in a difficult stage."
3,Not quite plagiarism,"Smith takes ideas from Roland Barthes (re Casablanca), Kingsley Amis (re special faces for every situation) and Will Self (re the dedicated banality of travel on a Virgin flight from London to NY) amongst others. She doesn't always do anything much with these ideas except to present them without acknowledgment. it's not really plagiarism but it's not really very interesting the second time around, either.Has the best joke in the world though."
1,What a disappointment!,"Unfortunately I have to agree with those who have given a 1 star rating to Zadie Smith's sophomore product. I thought it might be my fault I didn't seem to enjoy this ""genuinely funny and entertaining"" book...alas! it's not me who is ""guilty"" here. I just fail to understand why promising authors as Zadie Smith and Monica Ali are such a flop in their second effort! I loved Smith's On Beauty, it must be the best of all three, and decided to fill the gaps by buying The Autograph Man, but it's indeed a torture to read as another reader has commented... I don't think I'll ever be able to get past p.77... What a waste of time!"
3,"Very Intriguing, Not Insightful","Zadie Smith is by all accounts a good writer well worth reading. She has a knack with words, and the feeling and situations they convey, that many authors older and more experienced do not have. However, the book is rambling and directionless. One would think that Alex-Li would learn something/grow up/evolve like we expect all great characters to do (i.e Holden Caulfield, Alex of Clockwork Orange). Maybe I missed the Ah-Ha moment, but there seemed to be many places within the pages that begged for one. Smith writes like there is a grand purpose to where she has lead her characters, but then seems to lose focus. It almost seems that she is attempting to show the reader that life is not like a novel, and her novel is more like life. The only problem with that is: I picked up a novel."
1,Interesting book if you want to fall asleep suddenly!,"In the first part of her novel, Zadie Smith manages to create a strong aversion against the drug-addicted protagonist Alex-Li Tandem. The fact, that there was nearly no plot makes it difficult for the reader to concentrate in staying interested in the book.Alex-Li is very creative when it comes to drug-consuming, e.g. when he drinks the alphabet, but most of the time he is just annoying and unable to have a normal relationship with his girlfriend Esther. He is not interested in Esther's illness at all because all that counts for him is Kitty Alexander, an ancient film diva he is the greatest fan of.All the other characters in the book aren't interesting, either.The ordinary reader can't understand all the allusions to the jewish religion, to Buddhism and to movies nobody knows.The end isn't a real end, it's more disappointing than the rest of the novel."
4,A Very Off-Beat Offering..,"But if it's Zadie Smith,off-beat is her territory. This time the action centers around Alex-Li Tandem,a Chinese-Jewish Autograph Dealer from London. In the first chapter his father dies(at a wrestling match of all places) and things get weirder from there. In pursuit of his idol's signature,a reclusive retired movie star named Kitty Alexander,Alex encounters all types of odd people,friends who doubt his sanity and his other obsession-a ""Jewish vs. Goyish"" tome he's been writing for years. Uneven,but often very funny,once again Ms. Smith shows her knack for creating memorable charactors and situtations. Not as good as ""White Teeth"" but still holds it's own..."
2,Too many repititions...,"I am halfway through this book and I am already so annoyed by the references of ""international gesture""...the first two three times it was somehow funny...I am now on page 164 ..and she still keeps on using it..that is quite a turn off...repeting stuff over and over again...also, why does she has to refer to the singers always as ""the popular singer John Lennnon"", ""the popular singer Leonard Cohen""....small details like this made me quite annoyed while reading the book...and most of the jokes are not really that funny...I think it is still readable...but I must say that I have to put some effort to finish it...."
3,Her weakest novel.,"I'll read anything Zadie Smith writes. Really liked 'On Beauty' and 'White Teeth' and looking forward to NW. Smith can do dialogue just about as well as anyone and this one has a lot of exposition about the memorabilia trade which just was not that interesting. Also, the father-son dynamic just did not work for me."
4,"Orange Award Book, and you can see why.","Not the same caliber as White Teeth, but by no means dull. Zadie Smith writes in a creative way and is able to put to words thoughts that readers don't realize they ever have until they've read the words for themselves.The plot was interesting, but split in several places. This isn't necessarily a good thing, but in the end it left a few ends not quite finished. I found that I wasn't at all pleased with the ending relating the main character and the movie star he idolizes throughout the book. I felt there should have been more of a conclusion there than what exists.I highly enjoyed the book and its descriptive nature, even with the small disappointments that popped in occasionally. It is easy to see why the book made the Orange Shortlist."
1,Not Smith's Best,"Other than the first few pages, this book is a huge disappointment. Having read ""White Teeth"" and ""On Beauty,"" I found this to be lacking in emotional engagement (why should a reader really care about Alex-Li Tandem?) and poorly written."
1,Am I supposed to follow this?,"I picked up this book not only for Smith's reputation, but b/c it seemed odd enough to fall in love with. It was odd. And although I can appreciate the lack of energy/motivation the main character possesses as a general stereotype on the new English generation, this book fell extremely short of readable. I haven't read White Teeth, but I did see the short series that came out and if anyone is wanting to read Zadie Smith, stick with that and steer clear of this book."
1,It has all been said,"I have little to add to the previous reviews of this boring book. It never gripped me and never made me care about the characters.I do recommend this book as a study aid for students: read this book, and your textbooks will suddenly seem fascinating and full of life in comparison."
2,Would not Recommend,"I really enjoyed all of the characters in Smith's debut novel called ""White Teeth"". Autograph Man really never took off in my opinion and I wouldn't suggest adding it to your list of must-reads for 2004."
2,NOT Well Written,"I was very disappointed in this book. I often read historical romance, and although I tire of page after page of descriptions, I would like some! This book is VERY simply written, no flowery language or heated dialoge. A description of the hero's house reads like a kids book report, ""It had a fireplace...It had good windows...It had four bedrooms..."" The characters are undeveloped, and halfway in they've spoken less than a page of dialoge to anyone. I'm the type that can't put a book down whether it's good or bad, I just have to finish it, and yet this time, I have no interest in what happens to these people. Although the author seems to be able to come up with a wonderful plot idea, her telling of the story seems stilted and unemotional, her writing unorganized and uninspired."
2,Very Disapointed,I had high hopes for this book and very rarely write reveiws but just had to warn everyone that this book starts off pretty good but starts getting bad about halfway through. It feels like she hurried through the last part of the book... The characters seem fake and their conversations are dumb. I really think she should have taken more time with this book because the plot was good but the book wasn't at all what I expected.
1,What Happened?,"I have always loved Norah Hess' books, but I was really disappointed after reading this one. I was bored after the first few pages. The characters were flat, and the plot was weak. It was a long time between books before this one came out, and it wasn't worth the wait."
2,Dylan,thank you for this wonderful gift. This will make a great and wonderful gift family/ friend enjoyed and will enjoy reading not for me
2,C Needham,"This is the first Norah Hess book I've read, and it might be the last. I found her characters lacking depth, and the story suffered for it. I'm sure Ms. Hess can tell a story, but this book falls short in my opinion."
3,"Wasn't the BEST, but was good.","I have always loved Norah Hess' books, I have read just about every one she has written. I thought the book was pretty good. I read the book pretty quick, the only thing I didn't like about the book was that the ending seemed quick, it was like there was alot missing. Other wise a pretty good book."

4,Great JC&M Filler,"Sure, this is not what one would define as a proper album, but it does have some great singles on it, starting with I Hate Rock N Roll and Snakedriver. It meanders for a bit, and feels more like demos than finished songs. I do love Thirty Three and a Third (an homage to the Ramones song 53rd and 3rd, or just the speed of an lp?). Anyway, if you're a hardcore fan, or are maybe just curious to see what this band is all about, this might be a nice little primer. I would hardly rate this up with the band's best efforts -- see Psychocandy, Darklands and Munki. But this is a fun little slice of rock n roll from a band that has had its share of ups and downs in the industry."
5,A very hilarious cartoon,"There was one problem with this film: Lawrence Talbot. His personality and transformation are way off from the universal classic. Talbot did NOT inherit the curse from his granddad, he was bitten. He is NOT a grouch, he is a sympethetic man. His clothes do NOT get torn when he transforms, and his nose and ears do NOT turn the way they did here. Aside from that, this was great. Alvin, Simon, and Theodore (Ross Badgasarian)are working on a school play directed by a worried director (Rob Paulson). Their friends the chippets (Janice Karman) and the boys walk home. They are scared, and the boys trample the the flower garden of their neighbor Larry Talbot (Maurice Lamanchie). Alvin thinks he is a werewolf. Theodore ias bitten by Talbot and becomes a werewolf. Very hilarious film, a must see!(The sign of the wolf is a pentagram, NOT a pawprint I hope they make ""Alvin and the Chipmunks meet Dracula"""
4,"If You Love The Chipmunks, Don't Miss This One!","For those of us who grew up inundated with animated programs in the 1980s, Alvin & The Chipmunks is the most enduring and most magical. This latest installment is a welcome relief for those of us who yearn for animated programming which serves to achieve more than move merchandise. Light-hearted, charming, and always tons of fun, this latest Chipmunk adventure will surely delight all who stil think of the Chipmunks with great fondness. Here's looking forward to the next Chipmunk video from Bagdasarain productions! (Hint: We've seen enough scary stuff- howsabout something truly frightening- like Dave getting married! Of course, it would have to end in naught, but it would be awesome fun seeing how our furry trio put an end to Dave's wedded bliss!)"
5,Great Movie,My son loves this movie. Quality is great & it keeps him occupied. I recommend this movie to all the parents.
5,AWESOME!,"Everytime I watch this movie I like it more and more! It has both the Chipmunks and the Chipettes in it! Cool huh? It also has awesome songs in it too! Munks on a mission, The Monster is in you (I think that is what this one is called) and Everything is going to be alright. Everything is going to be alright is my personal favorite. The Chipmunks and Chipettes sing this one at a dance. I've played this song again and again. The only disapointment I had was there was only three songs. The Chipmunk Adventure had 8! But besides that this movie is AWESOME! I suggust buying it, if you love the Chipmunks and Chipettes! =)"
4,ABOVE & BEYOND AVERAGE,"FUNNY, EXCITING & ABOVE ALL ENTERTAINING!! THE CHIPMUNKS ARE GREAT!! THIS IS A PERFECT TREAT FOR HALLOWEEN!! YOUR KIDS WILL LIKE IT MORE THAN THEIR CANDY. ALVIN IS UNEASY ABOUT THEIR NEW NEIGHBOR. COULD HE BE A WEREWOLF? OR IS THAT JUST A DOG HOWLING AT NIGHT? OR MAYBE ALVIN JUST WATCHES TO MANY HORROR MOVIES. IT BECOMES A SCOOBY DOO LIKE MYSTERY FOR THE CHIPMUNKS TO SOLVE. IT'S A FUN MOVIE FOR ALL. AND YOU'D NEVER GUESS THIS WAS STRAIGHT TO VIDEO. IT'S BETTER THAN ALOT OF THEATRICAL RELEASES."
4,"If you love the Chipmunks, this one's for you!","Ross Bagdasarian and Janice Karman are back with an all-new, fun, and exciting adventure featuring the chipper trio of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore. Like the last feature video (Frankenstein) this latest video revolves around the spooky misadventures of David Seville's creatively overstimulated sons, with the Chippetts tagging along this time for good measure. Admittedly, the video lacks the thrill and excitement of The Chipmunk Adventure (it's not made with quite the ambition or reverence) but still won't disappoint those of us who grew up with the Chipmunks (especially those of us who grew up with the 80s version of the show). In an age where daily animated programs have all the charm of the average protozoa, this latest installment of The Chipmunks is welcome relief."
3,Did not capture the spirit of the movie,"My 2-year-old loves read-along stories and adores Pooh. This one, unfortunately, does not capture the spirit of the feature film. No songs, none of the cute little background stories/flashbacks that were present in the movie. So, this read-along is a little thin. Boring, actually."
3,Good Pop Compilation,"Fairly good batch of '90's hits, if you need one. All hits, different music styles ranging from rock, R&B, adult contemporary. The songs included are: 1. ""I'll Make Love To You""-Boyz II Men, 2. ""The Power of Love""-Celine Dion, 3. ""Fields of Gray""-Bruce Hornsby, 4. ""Weak""-SWV, 5. ""Breathe Again""-Toni Braxton, 6. ""Rock & Roll Dreams Come Through""-Meat Loaf, 7. ""Now and Forever""-Richard Marx, 8. ""If You Go""-Jon Secada, 9. ""Sentimental""-Kenny G, 10. ""I Don't Wanna Fight""-Tina Turner, 11. ""Wildflowers""-Tom Petty and 12. ""Reason To Believe""-Rod Stewart."
1,bought this for Samsung T809...don't!,"I bought this for my Samsung T809 as amazon said it would fit my phone. It doesn't! I can't close the top properly since my phone is just a bit too big for the case. What is the point of a phone case but to hold the phone? Since it won't close, it won't hold my phone properly! I returned it and I will keep searching for a phone holder that actually HOLDS my phone."
1,HAZARD if I could take AWAY stars I would.,"This is only my 2nd Amazon review, EVER, and I shop enough to get the Prime. But with this product I HAD to review it.... I struggled with the ANNOYING childproof lock that makes it virtually impossible to take it apart and it hurts to open it. I have to soak it EVERY time to get the food out so I can open it, but I would deal with it. But that is NOT why I am writing. I just discovered that this product will fit perfectly over his mouth and nose, like a match made in heaven. Which is pretty bad because it could easily suffocate him. These lids are going in the trash. I will continue to use them WITHOUT the lids (lest someone else let him play with them. However, given the hassle that it is to open it I think we may just go with the Munchkin ones. Very upset about this."
2,messy and difficult to use,"This product is a good concept but poorly designed. You need a steady supply of replacement nets - it gets really nasty especially after eating foods that turn brown like bananas or avocados. Tried boiling them and scrubbing them, but they're stained a nasty brown.The other problem with this is that after your baby eats, this thing is pretty much slimed. The system they use to lock the net in place becomes really difficult to unlock once it's all slimey."
4,Cuts Down on Mess!,"Good tool for that time when kids are transitioning to solid foods but don't quite have the motor skills necessary to pick them up or eat them properly. Cuts down on the mess produced too, the option to fling small pieces of food everywhere isn't present making it easier for parents. Replacement nets are available though may not be necessary depending on how fast your child transitions to eating whole foods."
2,Too big for baby's mouth,"I got it for my then 5-months-old baby. The mash net was too big, so it makes it really hard for my baby to use it. I only tried it twice and had stopped using it."
5,Great for teething.,"I prefer this mesh feeder to the Munchkin brand. This one is larger and easier to clean. I don't really like to put food in it. I freeze unsweetened applesauce in a ice cube tray, then pop one into the mesh. My son loves them, especially when he is teething."
1,Potential Hazard to your baby's health - Do not buy!,"I initially loved this product until I found green chipped paint from the feeder. It probably came off from my son's gnawing. I didn't even realize that there is paint on the feeder until it chipped off. If you look closely a the rim, every other square is painted green. I was so upset to know that paint was used on a product given to babies. The paint serves no such purpose an is barely noticeable. I am appalled to think that my son may have eaten some of the chipped paint for no reason. I will not buy any more product from a company with no regard for children's safety."
3,loved it until...,"At first I thought this was a wonderful item. My daughter enjoyed so many different fruits with gusto using this. Until I noticed food particles under the chiller part that I couldn't get out. I scrubbed, soaked, poked, and tried everything to get the bits out but couldn't. So now she doesn't use it anymore. If the chiller piece came completely out for cleaning it would be wonderful."
4,Well working its purpose and no problem so far,"I got this feeder for my son when he was 6 months old. Over several weeks since then, he had tried watermelons, nectarine, cantaloupes, pears and apples. As a feeder, not-to-hard-and-juicier food has had better result since baby can chew with his gum and get some taste out of mesh bag. As a teether, cold and hard food are preferred by my baby. The reason I gave 4 stars instead 5 is finishing work in mesh. The stitching should be more careful so the end part of mesh bag stays better. The other brands has more of this problem according to reviews, but this one is not completely free from it. Keep your eyes on the mesh bag, so your baby doesn't eat any of the nylon particles. Besides that issue, it is really smart and well designed product."
3,Poor design,"I like this feeder for the most part, it certainly gives me peace of mind when my baby eats solid foods. He chokes fairly easily and we just don't feel comfortable yet giving him finger foods but with this it's really nice and he enjoys it very much. The reason I gave this product only 3 stars is the design of it. The feeder has a plastic ""bladder"" that is supposed to keep food chilled in the feeder but food smashes against it as your baby eats. Tiny bits of food gets smashed between the bladder and the feeder making it difficult to clean. It really leaves me wondering how clean it is. The idea of the chilling feature is nice but not practical."
2,Not so good,"I was very excited to get this product but then was thoroughly disappointed. I thought maybe i was using it wrong, but any fruit i put in it barely made it out of the little teeny holes...it just mashed up and stayed inside mostly. I think my son got some food...but i did not like it. Plus it did not clean that easily. After a couple tries i never used it again. don't bother with it. Just give your kid a piece of banana and watch how much fun they have :)"
2,Not a Fan!!!!,"This thing is HUGE.....My daughter has a hard time with it. I gave it to her a few times, and gave up....Went to donation....What a waste of money. One thing its also heavy with the litte cold pack that is built into the handle. Another thing that kind of ticked me off is the picture has 2 of them on it, but you onlu get one....I know it's my fault for not paying attention, but still a little deceiving if you ask me....."
2,Works too well - can't taste the food!,"The product works well, in theory. Locked the food in place with no problem. Easy to grip. But the mesh is super thick and large. My little girl, who loves food and puts everything in her mouth, didn't want to put this in her mouth. She tried it, made an awful face and refused to put it near her face again. I introduced at 6 months, and then every few weeks after that. I've since given up.I don't blame her. I tried to eat an apple slice through it. I got hardly any juice and the feel of the mesh in my mouth was gross. Very unappetizing.Maybe if they had a thinner mesh??"
1,IMPOSSIBLE to open !,it's IMPOSSIBLE to open. I tried to get it openI would go with the Munchkin brand of this feeder bc it is much easier to open
4,this is the best invention for babies!,"This has been the best baby toy ever! I have tried a couple different brands, but this one is my favorite because when it has replacement bags for like $2.99, so when you've washed one several times and it starts to look dingy, you can just toss it- this one also comes completely apart for better cleaning, but it isn't white, so it doesn't look dingy after the first round of carrots :) It is a little hard to open (especially with banana-covered fingers) because you have to push the tabs and unscrew, but better safe than sorry."
3,Safe way for babies to start eating new foods,"We bought this a few months ago, but our daughter was a bit young for it. She plays with it, but still doesn't quite understand that it is food. I like that you can put the base in the freezer so you can keep the food fresh longer. It's a pain to wash, but the net does come out of the neck easily. I like that it locks closed, but it's really hard to get it unlocked. All in all, it's a great idea, but a bit of a pain. I don't give it to my daughter very often because of what a pain it is. It might be more worth it to me if she understood it better, but that will probably not be for a month or two. She's 6 months old now, and doesn't have any teeth yet.I also misunderstood that only one came in the box. I thought because of the picture it would have two in the package. My mistake, but I thought I'd let others know before they also made the mistake."
1,waste of money,buying this cd was a total waste of money. most tracks sound the same. there is no variety of sound in the tracks. i hate this cd. this cd gets quite repetative and annoying. i reccomend saving your money and spending it on something else but this garbage(unless you are a diehard fan or dave ralph).
2,Confusing and poorly organized.,"This book is a classic example of how [at least some] techies can't express themselves very well to non-techies. The examples don't work the way the author says they should (I've confirmed one example of this with Microsoft Press, whose rep couldn't figure it out, either), and worse, the author slides sideways into very technical discussions about concepts that haven't yet been defined. The accompanying CD comes with so little explanation that it only makes an already confusing situation worse. If you're trying to learn XML on your own, there has got to be a better choice than this."
4,Great for XSL,One of the few books with good concrete examples on XSL. Hard to find anything online that compares with this book.
2,OUTDATED AND LIMITED,"Decent book, but it's already outdated and the code samples are limited. The background information is still informative, but there isn't enough coverage of the API. The DOM API documentation is out-of-date and few useful examples are given. There is no coverage of the SAX API (which is supposed to be easier to use) whatsoever. None of the examples work with a webserver and only work if you open the file locally! I found myself using the MSDN Online website instead of referring to the book."
2,Is this a text on learning XML?,"Chapter 1 -3 are interesting. However, few examples are provided, and the content is real weak on syntax. I feel gipped, but hey, you will get plenty of screen clips containing the IE browser! The CD lacks useful examples as well and is poorly documented as to its use or content. If you are looking for a book on using XML outside the web, you will not find it here."
1,No mention of the Microsoft XML Extensions?,"Short, context-less and pointless examples. There seems to be no mention of MS's (important and controversial) extensions. Much of the text repeats the obvious without wisdom. For example, the author tells us that to declare an element with free form content we use the declaration <!ELEMENT test ANY>. He doesn't tell us, as other authors do, that, except for prototyping, this is a bad idea! In the theory and for IE 5 coverage Paul Spencer is much better. This book will especially disappoint database modelers."
2,No practical use,"A great book for those who want to know in very general terms what XML is all about, but who don't actually want to do anything with it."
5,XML in real life,"That's the strength of this title. It focuses on how xml can and should and is being used in the real world. Too many books documented xml in abstract and in theory and while that's a good place to begin the learning process, it's just not enough.This was the first xml book I read and it immediately helped me understand 'how' xml should be used as opposed just 'what' xml was. That understanding helped me apply the language to real systems and real business requirements.Be sure to check out the CD-ROM which contains code examples and supplemental documentation.Having said all this, I would still recommend you get a purely theory-based book to supplement with this guide because its coverage of the syntax is not completely comprehensive.Either way, it's higly recommended, especially now when xml has found itself into every corder of the IT world."
4,"It's good book, but... yes it's only overview","If you are interesting in XML and you need to confirm your concept on XML in short time, this book is good solution.Other , like XML Bible , XML Application has too much contents and nothing compared with this book.After read this book, you had better reference XML section in MSDN for real programming and more."
2,"Very poorly written, uses cryptic and difficult explanations","The author seems to have trouble expresses how to structure and write XML in this book. As a veteran techie, I was able to understand most concepts....after I had read the chapter 2 or 3 times over. XML could be expresses much easier...and this book really only touches some of the amazing abilities of this truly powerful language."
2,"A must NOT! read. 20% XML, 30% Java Scripts, 50% ??","I did not like this book. It was a waste of money as far as I am concerned. There is not enough of an overview at the beginning, and the author quickly buries you with DTDs and JavaScript examples without very clear explanations. XLinks are one of the most important features of XML and they are not even mentioned until Chapter 7. There was very little in this book that I did not find on the web at w3c or xml.org. There is another book ""Just XML"", by John Simpson that I have only glanced through, but it appears to be much better organized and focused than this book. Sorry William."
1,VERY POOR SOUND QUALITY on this MP3 album,"The sound quality on this MP3 album is horrible. The volume is extremely low, and when you raise the volume to a reasonable level, there's a LOT of hiss present. It sounds as if this was mastered from a poor quality cassette."
1,IT HAS TWO SONGS THAT ARE THE SAME....,"I was about to buy this product, However I did notice the that this cd has two tracks of the same song. You can play it for yourself and hear it. ""Chains Of Love"" is being heard twice instead of ""Please Don't Change""."
2,For the balletomane only,"La Bayadère might be Minkus' most famous ballet, but Don Quixote contains some charming music (in particular the character dances). Still, I cannot imagine anyone but the most hardcore ballet buff being able to sit through the complete recording. The worthwhile movements could easily be collected into a 20 minute suite. As it is, there is just too much of the same and too many long stretches of uninspired note-spinning to sustain interest.I have a few objections to the Sofia National Opera Orchestra's playing as well - they play everything charmingly, but I do think the score would have benefited from somewhat quicker tempi and a little more swagger. The recorded sound is fine, but as a whole this one is of interest only to specialists."
3,Modern Irish writing?,"Choppy reading, but original. It may take two readings. The lack of quotation marks, and the difficulty in following the author's thought pattern made this a struggle."
1,Disappointed by Structure,"I found this book boring. Somehow the structure of the work excacerbates it's ""boringness"". It was recommended to me by a friend. I read it. My friend and I no longer speak."
1,Expired product,"I have been using this product for years and love it. However, when I recieved this product it was a compelety different color and smell. Instead of the soft pink it was an orange color. I do NOT recommend buying from this seller."
2,S-factor seriuos conditioner,"i was not impressed with this conditioner, with matrix conditioners i can feel the difference instantly (Shinier and smoother)"
5,Best conditioner on the planet!,"This conditioner has real SILK in it - and believe me, you'll be able to feel it. It smells great and makes your hair as soft as ever. I would recommend this product to anyone!"
1,Different product in container,"When I received my conditioner the container was not sealed and the conditioner I purchased was not ""Serious"" by TIGI S Factor. They vendor filled the container with another product. Very disappointed, will not buy hair products from Amazon again. Amazon is great for other items but hair products would be off limits for me now."
4,Ahhh Peter Kreeft: Read Everything he's written,"A very good book written in Q&A format about angels (most of the book) and demons (one chapter). The book was enlightening in many respects. The book would have benefited greatly by starting with a short treatise on ""what is a spirit"" in a short form of Frank Sheed's ""Theology for Beginners"". This is a must read because so much angel information is happy / goofy stuff from Hollywood / Hallmark etc.. This book provides the ""true"" information about pure spirits and why God created them. Enjoy. It even explains what ""ghosts"" are, something that I have always wondered about."
4,Interesting Book,"This book was my introduction to Peter Kreeft's writing. I had heard of him but had not read any of his works until I tried this book. I enjoyed this book and found it interesting and informative. Perhaps his writing style can sometimes be a bit tough to get through and his ""jokes"" can be somewhat silly. Apart from these minor gripes I recommend this book to anyone interested in the existence of angels and demons and how we have reached an understanding of these bodiless beings. Although the book is packed with pertinent information I do wish the book could have been longer."
3,easy reading,I found this book to be very light reading. It could probably be summed up in a pamplet. Not very informative.
1,Save your money,"The entire book is a fraud. The author expects the reader to accept his statements and answers to questions without providing any reason or evidence. Reading it is an absolute bore. Using the author's reasoning, one can state with absolute certainty that there are invisible pink elephants floating around the universe. Save your money and buy other works of fiction."
1,ya,this writer talks about angels and demons and contradicts him self threw out the book my opinion save your money
4,Not bad!,I have been using this for about a month a find it reliable and of acceptable quality for business calls. The display could use some enhancements such as higher resolution and/or increase in size. But my callers can't tell any difference between the Linksys Skype Phone or a conventional land phone.
1,Good but not dependable,"I ordered the phone earlier this month. The set up was easy and it worked beautifully.However the phone stopped working after 3 days, a short of some kind according to their techs.But dealing with Linksys / Cisco was a nightmare. The customer service was unbelievably consumer unfriendly. All they wanted to do was sluff off their problems. I will not buy another product from them.Its too bad because the phone is good when it works. So if it works, it is a ""4""; otherwise it is a ""0"".Verinder"
1,Did not work properly,"The CIT200 Cordless Interned Telephony Kit for Skype did not work, is not supported by Linksys, and in my opinion, should not be sold. Zero stars!I should have paid more attention to all the negative reviews out there but thought that with my excellent technical knowledge, I could get the product to work."
2,When it works its great....BUT,"When the phone works it works very well. Clear sound on both ends. However, the big question is if it will work today. Furthermore, I wonder if Linksys has abandoned this product because the drivers need a lot of work and they are quite old."
2,Would love to try this phone out but won't install,"I've heard such great things about this phone and was really looking forward to trying it out. Unfortunately the phone won't work with my computer and its frustrating that the Linksys wasn't clear about this. It works only with 32bit versions of windows--urgggg! I've got XP x64 and it craps out on the install. Various message boards are saying there are ways but it requires a bit of hacking to make it happen.I'm sure its a great phone, but beware that if you have a 64bit operating system you may have woes!"
3,"Skype thinks globally, Cisco clearly does not.","The charger this phone comes with only works on 110 volts. I bought this phone for travel abroad since I have unlimited local and long distance at home and don't mind sitting in front of my computer when I talk on Skype. All cell phone chargers work at all voltages, as do camera chargers, iPod chargers etc. On the other hand this charger will only work in countries which operate on US voltage, unless you travel with an additional adaptor. I am surprised that Skype didn't catch this since they are an international company, and the majority of their users are outside the USA. Is Cisco parochial or are they merely cheap?"
3,Could do better,Although I found the phone easy to use I have had issues with the included PC software. In order for the software to run without a glitch I have to start it manually otherwise it will not initialize correctly and fails to locate the Skype client. Given that many other users have also experienced this problem Linksys should have updated the packaged software.Other than the software issue overall I am pleased with the phone. The connection quality is good and the range appears to be more than adequate.
2,ok.,"I got this phone cheap, as it has been discontinued. The phone is nice, durable, easy to use, and convenient. However, installing the phone will 'hijack' your audio capabilities, meaning that you can't listen to music or watch the news after install. Even if you adjust the Skype default audio settings, it is still buggy. One work-around is to create a separate log-in user profile and DONT install the phone on the other profile. depending on whether i want to use the phone OR listen to shows/music, I just switch between profiles."
2,stay way from this phone,"This phone is to expensive for what it does, I am very disappointed with it. it loses connection often shows unavailable and I have to unplug it from the USB port and plug it back again to work, I am glad I am a computer tech I even found out by myself that I have to remove the battery out to reset it and make it to work again which it does not say in the owner's manual.I use an older version of skype 2.5.0.113 because this phone does not work with a new version of skype. I updated skip and I had to downgrade to make it work. I called the customer support and someone told me that it does not work with the new version of skype. I am alerting people to stay away from it or buy at your own risk , if this 2.5.0.113 version stop working which is already outdated this phone will be completely useless"
4,CIT200,"Instead of using a headseat, just pick up the phone like any normal person! Works great in hotels and and home. This is the second one I've purchased and both are doing exactly what they are supposed to do. Mine are set up to autoanswer so all I do is pick up the phone and talk. It can be set to use a button to answer, but then it's more like a cell phone. The wireless connection hub for the computer sits out of sight and behind a desk. The handset cradle rests easily anywhere as the footprint is very small. Sound quality is very good and being able to wander around the room on a Skype call makes a big difference in your mobility. The speaker phone works well and volume is more than sufficient for most normal sized rooms. It works well and so far (two years on the first one) it lasts a long time."
2,does not work with vista,"it was great, i've owned for a year and 4 stars would have been a fair rating.till i've tried to match it with my new laptop suited with vista. no way jose, (and i was planning to get rid of my old laptop, for now would have to keep it to use my CIT200 till i find an updated product: recomendation that keeps poping out on a window on my screen on my new laptop w vista everytime i turn it on).anybody out there recommending a product of the kind that works well with vista?"
4,pretty good overall,"I bought this because we are soon to be living in Canada, and it will be easier and cheaper to call people over skype than on a regular land line. The phone works ok, has a bit of a limited range in this house, but so do our cell phones, that might be just this house. This phone has a horrible battery though. I took it off the charger and put it next to the bed when I went to sleep, 10 hours later the battery was dead."
1,Bad product and worse product support,"I bought this to use with Skype on my PC. From the beginning there were problems with the unit recognizing the Skype, although it worked every now and then. Then it stoped to work. I called the customer support and they walked me through re-installing the Linksys software as well as Skype, none of which worked. They promised a replacement unit and an e-mail was supposed to be sent to me with instructions on how the replacement will proceed. Nothing came after a week and I called them again. To make it short, they have passed me from 1 unit to other, troubleshooting 3 times, asking for information, confirming my case. And I still do not even have the form to be filled for the replacement. This was certainly my last product from Linksys!"
4,Great Device,"This is one of the early products designed for Skype. I am sure with the popularity Skype gets, more products will be available. Anyway, this product works well and the sound quality is great. Installation is very easy and straight forward. I don't spend a lot of time on the phone so can't say how battery lasts. It serves the purpose and integrates well with your computer. However, the only short coming is the product feels and looks cheap and screen is not clear and too small. With the limited products available today, this is really not a bad product."
1,"Very Inconsistant, bad software","When it works, works fine, however many times people call and it rings, then i here no voice on the other end, at other times it does not work at att. Frequently resets itself with no warning.If is use skype on the computer call quality is good, with the CIt, qualtity is all over the place.I would give this - stars if i could. A lot of this is a poor software within the phone (as a professional software developer, i have a good hunch about these things).I have 750 kb.sec upload 512 kb sec download, and use a condition to give priority of voip communications over internet line."
1,Nice idea but...,"Unfortunately I was unable to get the telephone to reliably connect to the computer. It would connect for approximately 5 minutes and the disconnect. At this point I noticed the battery drain observed in other posts...the battery on the unit appeared to drain even when placed in the charging stand.I am not sure if this was a compatibility issue with my computer and the telephone or if this was a defective unit. In any event, I did not have the patience to troubleshoot a system that was supposed to be a trouble-free system for integrating a wireless telephone with Skype. The system ships back tomorrow..."
1,This product stops all other audio players volume etc.,"Once you connect this telephony kit to your computer's USB, other audio players such as Windows Media player, your computer speakers etc. stop working.You have to unplug the telephony kit from the computer in order for the audio devices to work.In other words, a separate computer is required in order to use this telephony kit.I returned the product eventually and amazon returned only 75% of the money. I lost the shipping fee as well.Not satisfied!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Great, short battery life",Range is short and battery life is short. Don't buy. Not worth your money.
1,Phone will not find base unit after 3 months,"I was happy when i purchased this unit. After a couple months the rechargable batteries were only holding a charge for 1 call, so i purchased new rechargable batteries, and they were not charging. SO I BOUGHT AN EXTERNAL CHARGER, and the phone was just discharging batteries so fast. 1 or 2 calls and it was done.FINALLY THE UNIT WOULD NOT CONNECT WITH THE BASE. SEARCHING AND SEARCHING...EVEN IF IT IS CONNECTED WITH THE BASE/CHARGER/RECEIVER it did not work. What a waiste! being that i am a resident living outside the USA i was really pissed off. Cant return stuff outside the USA, and it was conveniently out of the 90 day warranty!SO MUCH FOR CISCO QUALITY. THEY MAKE GOOD ROUTERS BUT CRAPY SKYPE PHONES!!BIG DISAPPOINTMET"
2,If you buy this product be prepared to buy another...,"This product is not very well thought out. The battery lasts less then 24 hours not on the charger. Its range is about 30 feet in doors. It requires you to dial ""+"" ""country code"" ""city code"" ""number"" for every number. The sound quality is terrible.It would be forgivable if the product was priced below $20. But its retailing as much as $100 and so its not forgivable."
1,Too much distortion ...,"I bought this telephone for my wife so she wouldn't have to sit in front of the PC while calling friends and parents in France. She has given up on using it because of complaints about the poor quality of what they could hear. The sound is too uneven, distorted to the point it becomes difficult for the persons at the other end to understand what is said. Moving around doesn't change much unless I reach the transmission distance limit where it becomes inaudible. The sound coming from the set is clear but weak even at its highest volume setting. When using the microphone set by the computer, there is no problem, so I deduct that the microphone or the set it self is not of the quality we were hoping for. Just a waste of money."
2,Battery life short,"First of all after charging the battery, it lost life quickly. I was only able to use it for less than an hour.Secondly, it completely upsets my volume. I cannot receive sounds from my speakers when I connect the phone. I was disappointed."
1,i HATE this phone,"This phone is a piece of junk. The battery longevity is horrible meaning after a few months, it holds a charge for about half a day and then you have to charge it up again.The controls and features are worthless.The phone takes over your sound device so that if you're on your computer and you want to play back your messages from the PC or make a call out from a headset.. you have to switch your sound devices from Linksys to your PC sound drivers. The Linksys phone automatically switches Skype to it's own sound device even though it's not necessary for the phone to function.I've had this piece of garbage for a year now and I'm going to buy something else"
4,Decent value for price,I bought this at Frys a week back for $35. The configuration was easy although it took some time to figure out that having base station attached would mute your PC sound and to reactivate it you have to stop and start CIT program. Over all it works well. Make sure you charge it for 14 hours for first time. I had minor issues with batter but it corrected itself.
5,Brilliant!,"This product gets 5 stars in design and implementation. The buttons are where they should be, it feels like a phone, it ""talks"" like a phone. Definitley a must for every Skype fan. It also works with SkypeIn and SkypeOut so you can send and receive calls to this handset. Crystal clear voice quality. Absolutley brilliant. If I had, for the life of me, find a glitch in this device, I would say it takes a split second more than it should to scroll down on the list of skype names."
4,Response to Paddy,"This is in response to Padmanabh Srinivas ""Paddy"" review. The reveiw is completly wrong. Had he read the instructions he would have known how with a simple click of the mouse how to setup CIT200 to not take over the mike and loud speakers.I have been using the CIT200 since June 06 and it works as well as Linksys claims. However I suggest people who are considering a skype phone to check out CIT300 or CIT400. The CIT400 connects directly to the ethernet port of your modem/router so the computer does not need to be on for you to use skype"
4,Overall a good product,"I have this phone for over 1 month, so far it has not given me any problem. It's easy to use and reliable.Only set back is the charger is 110v, so if you are travelling to countries that have 220v you will need to have a 220v adapter to keep the phone charged."
1,Dropped calls. More dropped calls. Return.,"Linksys tried, you have to hand it to them. They even made the phone look like a regular phone.Skype, however, does NOT support wireless phones. Every single wireless phone I've tried for Skype has dropped the calls. EVERY single one of them! Every call, you're mid-sentence, and can't go further. The wireless function is simply not supported by Skype, and Linksys won't be able to support you for that very reason.Verdict: get a USB phone for Skype, like the FRee1 from IPEVO. They are the #1 in Certified Skype phones for a good reason... mac compatible, great echo cancelation, you can travel with it (reliable and sturdy), and they have great customer service (which Skype won't give you, so you have to make sure the manufacturer does)"
1,"It was nice, when it worked","I went through two phones, returned both to Amazon. The first phone did not charge fully. One 10 minute call and the battery would be dead. The second phone worked well for a week and then the sound quality took a nose dive and the microphone stopped working for outgoing calls.When they worked, I really liked this phone; maybe I just received two bad apples? In any case, I will wait a while for Linksys to fix the bugs or wait for another reputable manufacturer to release a cordless SKYPE phone."
1,Great device horrible support,"This device has served me very well over last few years, but now that I have upgraded to a new PC with Windows 7, I found out that CIT200 will not work. No new drivers are available and there is no normal way to contact Linksys tech support for the solution.My suggestion in 2010 - do not buy."
3,system issues unable to fix (with Windows),"The product was very simple to install and use, however, after restarting my computer once the program would no longer work correctly. Kept telling me that I needed to ""update my system"", even though it worked perfectly before hand. Tried reinstalling: showed it was connected however it would no longer read Skype as being on. Tried restarting system again and got same problem as before.Very disappointed with this product."
4,Pretty good bang for the buck,"I was skeptical at first, however after using this with my crappy DSL it's consistently performed, even in calls overseas. I can wander around my 2-story house without concern over dropping a call, and really like the fact these are rechargeable batteries! All in all - good deal. Yay for free calls!"
1,There's a much better product available now:,"Try the UTStarcomm F1000. It's $150 and much, much better. Don't need to have your computer on, since it's a WiFi phone. You can take it to any WiFi location, not just your own home, and use it with your account."
1,Ehh,"I got this for Christmas, right? I'm an avid skype user. The install went fine, the base station worked, but the display doesn't on mine. Hopefully, it'll work with a new one."
1,BEWARE,"Skype has a nasy habit of taking it's customer's money. There's no customer service at all, and immediately after you pay for Skype IN/OUT there is a high probablity that your account will be *blocked* with no explanation, and no recourse. Before you buy this product, I advise you to Google ""Skype Customer Service"" to see the HUNDREDS of people Skype has done this to.This is no reflection on the hardware, but if you buy a product that can only be used on Skype, you're asking for trouble."
5,Excellent phone,I tried numerous cordless Internet phones. This one is simply the very best. Excellent range and high clarity and reliability.
3,"Excellent for communicating with Skype, but...","It was up to my expectations for an easy and phone-feel communication with Skype, but it takes control of all the sound output of my notebook. I couldn't figure out yet how can I listen to my notebook (music, alarms, etc) without disconecting the wireless skype phone."
3,Great Idea but Some Design Flaws,"The phone works as advertised and installs fairly easily, but my biggest complaint is battery life - namely, when your computer, and hence the base station, is turned off. In such a case, the battery will discharge by at least half over a 12-hour period (unless it's resting in its cradle) even though it isn't being used. If your computer is on and the base station plugged in (phone in cradle or not), the battery life is good - comparable to a regular cordless phone. Yes, the phone has a power off button (similar to mobile phones), but evidently it doesn't fully power down and is silently looking for the ""missing"" base station.My only other gripes are that the cradle is flimsy and the power brick doesn't accept both 110 and 220 volts (this is the case for CIT200s bought in the US or Europe). I guess this could have something to do with different approved transmission frequencies on different continents, regardless, it's a pain when traveling."
1,Buggy,"I purchased this phone about 6 months ago and it had all sorts of bugs and never quite worked right. I then got a new computer and had lost the installation CD so I downloaded the driver from their website and it never worked again, the driver from their website was buggy and crashed my system over and over again. Very frustrating as I wasted hours trying to get it to work. I finally gave in and purchased a different phone today."
3,Linksys Skype Phone,"The phone itself is only as good as the Skype service. The quality of the line leaves much to be desired sometimes. The other problem is that you can only setup new phone numbers on the computer and not on the phone directly. Otherwise, the product is as advertised."
2,Cool Idea - Needs Improvement,"Cool Idea, Software works well with windows,wish it worked with apple or linux.When using this phone, user on the other end complains of bad echo.While Skype works fine with regular computer microphone.Had to buy a telephone headset to eliminate the echo.Come on people.Other than that the phone adds a low static hum to the conversation, its not devastating but definitely annoying.I'd recommend upgrading to the more expensive CIT or a going with a different vendor."
2,CIT 200 Problem,"Bought this unit for use with Skype. A problem began within a few weeks when the unit's power began to drain even when in the 'off' position. Linksys customer service was poor. They sent a silly initial response to my detailed description of the problem wherein they told me not to get the unit wet, etc., etc. So, I bought replacement batteries (two triple A nickel metal hydride) and will see if that fixes the problem. I would look for an alternate handset to use with Skpye."
4,Love this Movie,"I don't care what other people say. I Reallly love this movie and all of the other Nora Robert movies, the only thing that I wish they were is a bit longer so more of the story could be put into the movie like the book, esp. the ones like Monata Sky, Northern Lights, and Angels Fall, but really all of the movies. They do a pretty job of staying with the book for the most part which I really do like. Because I relly hate movies that are based off of books and then are so far off the book it makes you not want to finish watching it. So for the others that gave this movie such a bad review to each is own that is their right, but you don't have to listen to them. And I had forgetten that this was Brittany Murphy's last movie before she died. She will be missed. She did a very good job on it."
1,Great seller...BAD movie,Great Seller...The movie was terrible. Bad acting by all. Nothing more I can say about it except...Save your money.
5,Good movie..,"I would recommend this movie for anyone who loves to read Nora Roberts. This is one of the few stories turned into a movie that stayed on point. It's definitely one of my favorite books, and now, favorite movie!!"
2,"Loved the Book, Did not like the movie","I really loved the book, but the characters in the movie were nothing like the characters I imagined in my mind while reading the book. The Heroine in the book was a very strong person. It the movie the make her appear very weak and reliant on a man to do something. I normally like the Nora Roberts movies, but this is the worst one I have seen to date."
5,"Love, mystery and murder","Made for TV, Nora Roberts combines love, mystery and murder into a a wonderful 90 minute pastime. After watching the movie you'll be left with a profound sadness that the star of the movie has died a such an early age. Britteny Murphy will be missed."
3,Murder in the Antarctic,"A claustrophobic novel about a turn of the century Antarctic expedition which turns into a murder investigation when one of it's members is found dead on the ice. The bulk of the novel involves discovering the victim's past and how it interconnected with the lives of the other team members. An interesting, light-weight novel with a twist at the end. Read it on a snowy weekend."
3,Jack is no historian or pharmacologist.,"Jack does make some outrageous claims about marijuana in the history of this planet but I would have to say he has more knowledge about industrial hemp than any other person on the planet. I wouldn't really rely on anything the man says about history or pharmacology but he has some really good things to say about the possibility's of industrial hemp, one of the best parts of this book is the massive appendix of primary source material, I recommend this book to everyone just make sure you take his history lessons with a shaker of salt.Someone claiming to be a historian made a big error mentioning receptors, THC does not bind with any opiate receptors. It binds to the anandamide receptor. At the time Herer wrote this book, the receptor had been discovered but anandamide had not... so his speculation about why the receptor existed wasn't completely ridiculous at the time (at least it wouldn't have been ridiculous for a non-pharmacologist like him)."
3,What was everybody talking about,"I wish that the world could get it together, and start being more responsible. If this book is true then it sounds like hemp is the way to do that. It can be used for so many different things, an alternitive source of fuel, for clothing, for paper products. If you listen to what the author says, then there are more uses, but with the oil companies and every other big money making market that could be replased by cheaper, better, envirenmentaly safe hemp products in control, we will never see that. The auther also prases the effects of marijuana. Another product of hemp, almost saying that it has no effect on you and that it is good for you. This (I know from experence is not true.) I heard it put so well by someone, I don't remember who (Pot makes you feel fine with doing nothing). And when you are doing nothing your life can start to fall apart."
5,THE EMPEROR WEARS NO CLOTHES IS AMAZING!,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BOOK! IT IS VERY RESOURCEFUL AND KNOWLEDGABLE IN THE HISTORY OF CANNABIS/ MARIJUANA AND PROVIDES LOADS AND LOADS OF COOL FUN FACTS ABOUT THE WONDERFUL PLANT AND ITS AWESOME QUALITIES AND USES! I RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO READ THIS BOOK! WE MUST SHARE THIS INFORMATION AMONGST THE MASSES! CANNABIS CAN SAVE THE WORLD! THE WORLD ONCE DEPENDED ON CANNABIS FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING IN OUR DAY TO DAY LIVES!
5,save the planet,This book is a must read for every citizen of the United States. The United States is driving people to drink and cannabis would be a much better and safer alternative to alcohol. Jack Herer's book is highly entertaining and very informative and presented in an extremely interesting format. Read this book and pass it on. Spread the word. This book should be on the number one best seller list.
5,This book changed my life and can change the planet.,"Jack Herer's compendium shocks the reader into activism by showing how the greatest plant the world has ever known is being demonized for corporate profits. Since reading this book, I have been preaching the benefits of the hemp plant and utilizing it myself by eating hemp products and buying hemp clothes for myself and as gifts. Read the book, spread the word, and save the world."
5,"It's wonderul, I have seen it about 10 times and I still cry","When a saw this movie I was 15 years old, in that time I didn't want to see it, because the tittle didn't say me anything but my mother told me that Forever Friends was a good movie and she convinced me, I couldn't stop to cry. Now, I am 19 and I love that movie, because is the perfect relation, I think that everybody dream with that kind of friendship, in my case I do it."
4,Taylor's Still Got It,"Mick was sitting in with another band when this was recorded, and there's some good stuff. Some different versions of songs like ""Sweet Home Chicago,"" but it's when Mick hits the stage that things really heat up.""I Wonder Why"" has been in Mick's repertoire and live shows for years, and he smokes yet again on this and some other cuts.There's another CD of European live dates that's even better."
1,Another Alchemy Records Ripoff,"Buy it. Open it Up. Read the liner notes (and I quote), referring to the music on the CD: ""whilst not being a Mick Taylor solo concert per se . . . Mick . . . realy get[s] down to some excellent playing."" I beg to disagree. There is no audible evidence of this. Perhaps Mick just dropped by the bar where this generic boogie band was grinding out their beer commercial blues for a quick drink and then got the hell out. You can't blame him."
4,"As far as toaster ovens go, this appears to be the best","Have not have good experiences with toaster ovens -- they seem to be made cheaply. Reviewed a large number of models in stores and there was no doubt that this was the best quality model (in the non-digitals). All the others seemed a much lower quality and had quirks like the crumb tray being pulled out from the back.All the knobs and the way it operates is just what I wanted. I hated the LOUD beeping on the digital DeLonghi.Cooking wise, it seems to do an OK job. This is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. There are a lot of toaster ovens in the $100 range and this one is definitely worth $30 more than those."
2,Only if you have the time to wait for it to warm up....,"Very disappointed with this oven. I thought that I could work in the time that it takes for it to warm up into my breakfast routine, but it took about 7 minutes for it to get to temperature. Putting bread in any earlier makes warm bread, not toast. Once warm it works very well and if I were using it solely as an oven, I wouldn't have any complaints, but when I was looking to make a purchase, I searched for ""toaster oven"" and this came up. I made the purchase, even thought I read the reviews warning about this product mainly because the handle and finish matches perfectly my Kenmore elite appliances.I am also disappointed because for $130 I would expect a little engineering to go into the slideout tray, either in the form of a hook that pulls the tray out when the door opens, or some kind of catch that keeps it from falling on the door when it is pulled out."
1,Extremely Poor,"This has to be the worst oven of its kind on the market! Don't buy it! The oven has an inner coating of teflon, that flakes and peals off when subjected to high heat. Becareful the flaked teflon may fall in on what you are cooking, broiling or toasting!"
4,slow in toast mode,"takes longer to toast items than any previously owned toaster/oven Dark setting produces essntially hot dry bread or what ever item you are toasting, increasing time to nearly ten minutes will finally provide the appearance of the item being toasted"
2,Somewhat disappointing,"This model is larger than I would have liked but I bought it because of the Kitchenaid reputation. The price is too high for what it offers and I really dislike the timing feature-WAY too annoying as it shuts off after 30 minutes max. It takes a LONG time to toast a few slices of bread, so I recommend using a toaster instead. The other way to improve this toaster is to avoid the black paint on the sides and top and replace it with the brushed stainless- as it is on the front. The paint wears off and scratches easily."
1,Please...SAVE YOUR MONEY,"What a disappointment. I am a huge Kitchenaid fan and I can't believe the poor quality of this toaster oven. As others have said, the finish is poor...the paint is not smooth and is chipping off around the oven door straight out of the box. The stainless steel trim is rough and cheap looking; it seems poorly machined. As for the performance, toasting is totally aggravating since the top element gets MUCH hotter than the bottom. The timer is cheap and the ""ticking"" is annoying. When the timer ends, the bell is out of synch. There is no on/off switch; just the timer to control the oven. I expected MUCH more from a toaster oven in this price range. I was happier with my old Toastmaster that cost about $40 and lasted for years. You can do much better than this for considerably less money."
2,I expected better from KitchenAid,"I expected a lot more from this oven, bought to replace a flimsy B&D large capacity that lasted nearly 2 years. The paint was chipped where it met the chrome in my case too. I can live with that. The timer works for only 30 minutes, a definate minus. One hour should be minimum. I made a potato casserole and the top burned. Likewise, garlic breadsticks that were in for only 2 minutes, not the 4 called for. Toast is beautiful...on top only. A Barber Chicken Kiev was dry. I bought this because of the brand name as KitchenAid always meant the top of the line to me. I have a chicken I want to try roasting in it...but the timer will have to be reset. The handles are not necessary and stick out too far. You must keep this 4"" away from all walls, backsplashes etc. A real downer. Some insulation would be welcome. It seems sturdy, but performance is lacking. They should have given this one a little more thought."
1,NOT Worth the price!,"I am VERY disappointed in this Kitchen Aid Oven. I wanted to get rid of my huge four slice toaster and try this beautiful six slice toaster oven, plus my husband sometimes eats a little later than the rest of the family the days he hits traffic coming home so I thought this would be GREAT to keep his food warm in without putting on my oven. Well, I gave up after 10 minutes trying to toast a bagel,it just dried out and NEVER toasted! The timer which is only 30 minutes drove me CRAZY with the constant ticking sound and the plate I tried to put in the oven did not fit! It was just a regular size dinner plate. I always read reviews on items before I buy. This time the item was on sale, it looked nice and it had a reputable name. I guess none of that matters because now I have to lug it back to the store!"
3,Good design; poor assembly,"I like the other reviewer was highly anticipating this oven. My guess is that Kitchenaid has had issues with it as I believe they postponed the initial release by about 3 months.My unit arrived without any damage to the unit but it also had the paint chipping off where the stainless steel facing meets the painted frame. I called Kitchenaid and I guess was one of the fortunate ones to get another unit shipped to me which; although not perfect, was much better. I too have been less than pleased with the overall quality control.As for the operation of the unit, no problems! I am still satisifed with my purchase but certainly feel that Kitchenaid has a few assembly issues that need to be resolved."
2,Poor quality dials,"This product has worked ok for me except for the cheap dials. The lettering wears off within 4 to 6 months--especially if you dare to clean them. I've called Kitchen Aid and they have replaced them 3 times already. Of course I have to tell them each time that the unit is only about a year old, otherwise they would not replace them. I will not pay for new dials because they literally are unreadable after 4-6 months anyway.Save yourself the hassle and buy something else."
2,Lousy Toast,"Bought this toaster oven about 5 years ago. I like the look and size, the crumb tray pulls out and cleans easily. I like the 30 minute timer and that the oven shuts off when the time is up. I use this for heating and warming, good for muffins and warming frozen soft pretzels, I don't have high expectations from a toaster oven, except one. I use this every single day for toast, and it does a really poor job. I'm looking forward to replacing it, wish I did so 5 years ago!"
2,Pretty but made cheap,I bought this item to get a quality oven. It was fairly expensive compared to several other items but looked well made. After minimal use the knob broke. Parts are difficult to find except at Sears. The knob is very cheaply made and cost about $15. Now I really don't want to use it because of the fear it will break again. I do not recommend this product. I would go for the cheap ones and replace ever few years.
1,YIKES!,"Please make sure you wake up an extra fifteen minutes early if you want toast!It takes an unbelievable 10 - 12 minutes to toast bread, and even then, some pieces have burnt edges, and some are merely dried out.We reluctantly gave up our ancient Black & Decker toaster oven for this - what a mistake."
1,BAD DO NOT BUY,This stupid thing went on fire 5 times it made my house smell really badthe timer gets stuck and then bread gets on fire
2,kitchen aid fan but......,"I am such a huge fan but the counter top oven is terrible,I have had mine since christmas 2006 and it is not used very much however the lower elements are not working,I contacted kitchen aid and they say they have had no problems with any of these ovens,and unfortunately mine was manufactured in 2006 so I am out of luck but they will give me a discount if I want a new one.They went on to say they couldnt help me further because it would be unfair to other consumers.Having seen all these reviews it seems there are some problems and I will be contacting them again"
1,Burnt Toast Anyone?,"This is by Far the worst appliance I have ever owned. My wife and I registered for this toaster oven as part our wedding registry from Fortunoff's and unfortunately someone bought it for us and we were unable to return it. Let's start with the amount of time it takes to pre heat, if you live a leisure life and have plenty of time to wait for a toaster oven to heat up, this is the oven for you. Next the amazing ability to burn toast. For the past 6 months, I don't believe I have had evenly toasted bread, it seems like they designed this oven to burn toast unevenly. And what I love most about this oven is the extremely hot handle when you are done cooking with it. Be prepared to burn your hand just like your toast. I am very disappointed that Kitchen Aid would badge their name on such a product as I have thought they produced quality products. I would never purchase another Kitchen Aid product. Fool me once, only once!"
2,doesn't toast bread!,"I bought this item[...] and toasted bread as a trial. Only the top burners turned on, and the bread was toasted one-sided. And it took forever! Why would a company make a toaster that doesn't do it's main job- to toast bread?! Needless to say, I returned this item back[...]. I'm very disappointed in Kitchen Aid. I have other products from them and they are excellent, but this one fell short of even the lowest of expectations."
1,noisy timer during operation,"In order to use the over, you *have* to set the timer. The timer ticks down like a ticking time bomb. As I find this highly annoying, I am returning the oven."
2,Doesn't Last Long,"It worked fine for what we needed it for. We had this little oven for a year and then one day it just stopped heating up and now it is just broken. I'm a KitchenAid fan too, but if seeing all the negatives on this product and how they treat customers requests for assistance I'm not sure I'll remain a fan.A~"
1,glass shattered!!,"Have used the oven for almost a year but do not recommend it for toasting bread...takes too long and toasts unevenly. Plus, after ten minutes of using the broiler last night the oven glass door shattered into hundreds of little pieces."
2,Well..........,"it heats things but has the features of a 1929 toaster oven. Racks fall out. Door does not pull on rack for easy access like cheaper models do........thin on user-friendliness. Buy another brand. Oh, it looks good!"
3,good but not great!!!,"Recently i had the need for a new convection replacment due to my old one having a cracked bottom element, so I did alot of reasearch & decided too buy a KAide, it's OK but the wire shelf falls out every time you slide it just alittle foward and on occasion with a casserlole dish it drops & crashes down on the bottom elements? the sides of the rack are too short The toasting capability is OK but this oven burns things up very quickly , it has uneven browning You really need to read the manual about moving the rack where it need too be for certain items good luck I really miss my Delongi convectin oven I would have bought another But I went through 2 in 2 years"
2,Seems like a quality oven until you start using it,"Like other reviewers, I am very disappointed in my purchase of this toaster oven. I find that when making toast, it either leaves the toast crispy but white, or toasts very unevenly, or burns it completely. When toasting two slices, one comes out much darker than another. The heating elements take a long time to come on, and when they do, the top one is much hotter than the bottom. I have to keep turning the toast manually to get an even toasting. Plus the ticking timer is annoying, and it runs on after the timer shuts off. I haven't tried baking anything yet -- I'm an excellent cook but I suspect the oven will pretty much ruin everything I try in it. This oven looks attractive on the shelf, and it seems to be very well made in comparison to others. But its performance is very poor. If you are considering it, shop around some more. I wish I had."
1,Unfortunate Choice,"Unfortunate choice and me a kitchenAid loyalist! The thing that bothers me the most is the interminable wait for this oven to heat up! I may as well use the regular oven. I had an old cheapy Black&Decker (I think it was) that would heat up in a couple of minutes, this oven can take a good twenty minutes which defeats the purpose and convenience for me of having a toaster oven. In addition it does not heat evenly and so I have to rotate the food. I am beginning to shift my loyalties to Breville and although this oven is fairly new I think it is going in the Goodwill box."
1,Kitchen Aid Toasteroven Needs Help!,"Don't buy this toaster oven! Absolutely the worst oven ever! Takes FOREVER to heat up, burns everything unless you stand and watch it, takes up a lot of room and when it does toast, does it so unevenly. If you have more than 1 piece of bread toasting, all outside edges of the bread burns before the centers are toasted. I am so lucky that mine just caught on fire and burned so I can get a new different model that reviews better! Only thing good about it is that it looks like a quality piece. Like a museum piece...totally unuseable!"
2,give me back my old Krups!,"It's as hot outside the oven as inside. The heat comes out not only through the glass but through the seams at all the edges. It's SLOW< SLOW, SLOW. Takes 10 minutes to warm up--for toast. It may look fancy but what good is that when it doesn't work efficiently."
3,OMG! This completely quit working,"I rarely come on here and take the time to write a review. To be fair, this unit lasted almost 5 years, but with very light use. It was taken care of, kept clean, etc. It will NOT heat up at all. The timer works but the oven stopped heating. I came to Amazon to check out the reviews and I couldn't believe all of the bad reviews I saw so I had to ad mine! I realize that most people only write a review if they are UNHAPPY with a product, those who are happy don't write a review (usually) so we need to realize that when reading online reviews, but this shouldn't have broken this soon. That said, I didn't think the build quality looked cheap. That part seemed fine to me."
2,Hot to Handle,I paid $36.00 for this oven on clearance at Macey's. The right side of the handle gets too hot to handle without a hot pad. It really is not made well. I certainly would buy a better model next time. Who knew you couldn't trust the Kitchen Aid brand?
1,Don't do it!,"Bought one as a refurbished unit; thought I was getting a good deal. It takes 8 miniutes to produce toast that is dark brown at edges and un-toasted in middle. The maximun time you can bake for is 30 minutes. If you want a longer time you have to re-set the timer. The baking tray is small compared to the size of the oven. The handle stays relatively cool, but you can burn your finger if not careful on the oven front. It cost more than half of the price I paid to return it. Very disappointed."
2,Broken after two years and light use,"We received this as a wedding gift and it seemed Ok at first, but now here we are shopping for a new one after only two years. So disappointing!"
1,stuck with it,"I received this as a Christmas gift and couldn't take it back. It is the worst. I have to babysit toast to keep it from burning and it takes forever. Both my son and I have been burned trying to get waffles off the back portion of the rack when the wire rack suddenly tilted forward and into our bare wrists. I tried to give it to my daughter for her college apartment but she wouldn't take it (that should tell you something right there!). I miss my old 4 slice toaster and can't wait for this thing to break so I can get something else. This just goes to show that spending more for something doesn't necessarily mean you are getting a better product. Also, looks can be deceiving as it looks very nice sitting on the counter but it isn't worth the space it takes up. Please don't waste you money on this item as you will regret it."
3,i'll cut your hair,"wow first of all let me say what this album is NOT. it is not bad, it is not a joke, and it is CERTAINLY not rap-rock in any shape or form. what it IS is a jovial romp through underground pop-dom, this is a great cd as long as you use it for maybe a house party rather than an all-night drive, check these guys out, you won't be dissappointed"
5,Great album!,A fantastic mixture of indie pop and lo-fi. The album brings the listener through a story- loving life and wanting to hold onto it dearly and lastly being able to accept the idea of death. The album is absolutely brilliant and I just can't stop listening.
5,Quirky fun,"Bottom line: if you enjoy quirky pop music that has a heartbeat and a strange sense of humor, you will adore this album. The Unicorns are more than happy to come across as trigger-happy nerds who love to toy with their own songs to make them completely unpredictable and remarkable. Strange music, stranger lyrics, cheeky/cute line trade-offs (""I hate your music/No you don't/Yes I do!"") and a fun obsession with ghosts and death. Trust me, you haven't heard anything yet until you hear Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone. What a trip."
3,correction,"i'm pretty sure THE UNICORNS are not OF MONTREAL, infact i am pretty sure they don't even share members - thank you"
2,Funny... but great music?,"O.K. so the other reviews are very good. Drop by the Britney Spears page and see how wonderful she is according to her fans. The lyrics are funny. Not too funny, but funny. You will get over them and fast (God help you if you dont). The music is cheese from front to back. This albumn almost feels like a joke on the listener. I wonder if the Unicorns look at their bank statements and think who in the world would by this crap, we made it as a joke one night while very, very high. That being said, if they sobered up and actually tried to produce a decent record, they just might be able to do something novel."
2,Hodgepodge,"Boy, it doesn't take much for Canadian bands to get ""next best thing"" status, does it? Montreal-via-British Columbia's The Unicorns are heroes in both Canadian and U.S. alternative press on the basis on their sophomore effort Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone? To say it's a hodgepodge isn't really to do justice to the disjointed forces at work here. Nick (Neil) Diamonds and Alden Ginger are not of the ""everything but the kitchen sink"" school of songwriting - they start with the kitchen sink and progress (or devolve, depending on your POV) from there. They're as abrasive as you'd expect. Lots of fun, too. One tune even has a nifty Irish pennywhistle motif. Still, as interesting as much of this is, the songs that truly work (meaning make a gut-level impact) are the simplest ones - the rocking ""The Clap"", the rocking ""Les Os"", and the very rocking ""I Was Born (A Unicorn)"". So much for experimentalism."
2,Undercooked Indie Pop,"2 1/2 starsAn album that basically states ""we're here, we're unique, we have some talent"", rather then accomplish anything on it's own musically-sadly this indulgent but perceptive band left this as little proof of even existing and hopefully are articulating some of this unfocused talent into more memorable projects. The over indulgences with 4/4 sound manipulation, casio beats, overtly quirky vocals distract from their talent at deconstructing and undermining a catchy pop song with respectable guitarkid-chops to boot. This is an interesting footnote if you have time and energy invested in the independent scene, or if you just really loved warped, but playful lo-fi druggery."
4,Good supplement,"This is an excellent learning tool. There is a mini-book for every of the 100 words. However, you have to copy each page separately to make each book. You cannot pull out pages because there is another word book on the next page. If you have more than one child, it makes sense to copy the book to save it. Otherwise, you spend more money on paper and ink."
3,Great Reinforcer,Easy to do homework. Great reinforcers. I make a copy on colored paper then laminate and put them in the writing and library centers.
4,Missing Parts,"This is a fun project. My horse only came with half a heart (parts missing), so that was annoying."
4,Visible Horse,"I will never assemble this model, because the smell of model cement is gruesome. But it makes a very good fine art supply, to learn how to draw skeletons, and looks fantastic as ""dead horse bones"" in a desert diorama."
2,Not well made,"I have to say I was really dissapointed in this model. Nothing snaps together well. The pieces kind of fit together but due to poor craftsmanship, the joints don't fit where they are supposed to. It is very annoying. I have been working on this for over a week and most of the time has been waiting for the cement to dry. I don't know what cement others are using, but the one i have just doesn't work for the joints.Also, the directions STINK. You need another anatomy book to really understand how everything goes together.Unless you REALLY want to learn basic equine anatomy (and it will be from another source while you try to make this thing) don't get it."
2,Invisible Horse,"Extremely difficult to assemble!!! Parts do NOT snap together that are meant to, so there is no way to take it apart and reassemble as the instructions claim..."
5,Cool Product,"I haven't had a chance to put it together yet. When I owned it when I was little it came already together. I am not good at putting models together, but when I do I know I will enjoy it very much."
1,Save your Money,"My 11 year old daughter bought this from a museum gift shop. She loves horses and science and thought this would be fun.We have spent hours assembling this thing. Whatever you do, don't follow the instructions. They are backwards. If you do the skeleton first, there is no way to insert the organs. The pieces are supposed to be able to be snapped together. They don't. Glue doesn't hold them either. At one point the instructions told us to use cement - it was not included. The box shows the organs different colors, they aren't.We finally rearranged the picture instructions (there are very few words) and used clear packing tape to hold it together. It now vaguely resembles the front photo. The organs are all the color of Silly Putty and the leg bones are held in place by hope, prayer, and the clear outer case."
5,Eh? Is for...A Very Good Read!,"This is a lovely book - romantic, charming and funny - about the author's travels through Spain along with his artist girlfriend, an ancient tent and hardly any money. He is a poet, with hippy leanings and a quest to escape the mundanity of life in the heat and koleidoscopic skies of Spain (not forgetting the ants). As his girlfriend paints pictures in watercolours, he paints them in words, and creates a canvas of wonderfully astute (and sometimes seeringly honest) observations amidst poetic visions.I would recommend anyone to read this book who has ever wondered what it would be like to journey into the unknown and back again."
5,Your Body Is Your Subconscious Mind,"This audio collection is a must. I would recommend to EVERYone and ANYone: listen over and over. Take notes. Dr. Candace Pert will open your eyes .......and your mind....... to more than you ever could have imagined, when it comes to the mind/body connection and so much more. Want to understand how your FEELINGS effect and create your physical health? Listen to this information."
4,We are our body,"This recording basically goes over the ground in Pert's wonderful, important book ""Molecules of Emotion"" in which she sets out the notion that our mind is not in charge of anything. The whole body is in charge and it percolates its changes into the mind, exactly in reverse to our conventional way of thinking (that mind and matter are disjunctive or separate things). She says we are not meat, the view of the old anatomists who dissected corpses, but living flames changing with every moment, elusive, adaptable, mysterious. I think we need to review her findings and insights over and over until her ideas which are empowering overcome our old view of being helplessly at the mercy of whatever out there strikes us."
3,Less than I expected,"This was recommended to me. I didn't get much out of it personally. But that doesn't mean it is without value. I learned a thing or two, but I was expecting more enlightenment. I will say that I love the title of this audio book. That alone was enlightening enough for me to purchase it and see what else the author had to say."
5,These Three Kings Rule!,"This recording is a wonderful addition to any Christmas collection. It has power, charm and just enough reverence! Anthony Kearn's ""Lord's Prayer"" is magnificent! Finbar Wright's ""How Great Thou Art"" is awe-inspiring! After four years with the ""Irish Tenors"" poor Mr. Wright still must endure the ignorance of a few ""fans"", being constantly compared to John McDermott. Finbar took the ""Irish Tenors"" to a new level, as acknowledged by both Kearns and Tynan. I wonder how long ""Ringo"" had to endure being compared to Peter Best? Get over it people!"
1,3 Tenors Christmas,"This was VERY disappointing - too noisy & just the wrong type of music for these guys. I played it once & will try to get someone to take it off my hands - I love listening the them, usually, but this album is just a dud."
5,New Christmas Music,I added this to my Christmas music collection this last year. It is great to hear the old standards with these beautifully trained voices.
4,happy happy joy joy,my mother loved it she listened to all through the holidays.she was very pleased.bla bla bla bla bla bla there.
3,Not The Same without McDermot,"The tenors remain very good, but some of the presentations in this CD did not impress me - but that may be an idiosyncrocy on my part."
4,Well done!,"Fans of early Celtic Frost should flock to this one. DTTOE features soild production with old-school black metal songwriting. Not the fastest, nor most technical BM release, but Carpathian Forest's strength lies in the simplicity of the songwriting. These are grooves that can be appreciated from the first listen. Highly recommended."
2,100 miles per hour screaming,"100 miles per hour screaming just about sums this one up, its basically a dumbed down death metal album which isnt saying much, their earlier stuff has a lot more too it. It not totally bad though, I liked the last 3 songs on the album, and Cold Murderous Music has a very sweet sound. My suggestiong would be to buy one of their older CDs, unless you like death metal, and hope that they will spend a few years making a good black metal album next."
3,"fun, just dont pay attention to the game.","what happens when you mash together shoot-dodging, headshots, unlimited ammo, and sprinkle in plot? a stupidly fun shooter for the psp! the headshots and cool moves like jumping out of moving trucks and juggling chickens with gunfire do a remarkable job of masking this games flawed point system, and lame storyline. but who need points when you still level up pretty much automatically? and who needs a good story when you've got guns (just look at A.L.I.A.S. ie ""Jennifer Garner with plot"")In the end, its fun, really fun actually. but remember... this is more smokin aces than bourne identity. if you care about that you'll be better off with metal gear solid, socom, or ghost recon"
1,Don't do anal sex!,"After reading this, I went to various other websites and determined it can rip the anus muscles, needing surgery. Nope...not for me"
5,i love this book,"i ordered this book seeking a way to add zest to my love life. it was not only a great book to read, but was very informative. after putting the info. to the test i must say this book gave me a wonderful experience, and banished my fears and misconceptions. thanks for writting this book. (-:"
3,Not well-received,"Be careful and think long and hard before you give this book to your wife or girlfriend as a gift. As I learnt to my cost, if she looks at it in horror you won't be able to tell her that you are a little drunk and just slipped."
1,Fine acting; despicable characters' storyline.,"I know it's a film, and not reality, but I was completely shocked by the crooks' abuse of kindness.The biggest and final heist occurs at Harry Winston jewelers, and it is only possible because the store manager is kind-hearted. After the crooks sink to this despicable ruse, I would have cheered if they had been been shot dead, for what is more loathesome than turning goodness against someone to one's own advantage?Warren Lane wrote the screenplay. I wonder if the original Claude LeLouche story, 'La Bonne Annee,' took this turn or if Lane was unable to, or too lazy to devise a way for the crooks to get into Winstons that did not require wounding another character's spirit permanently."
2,"Heartfelt, but lacks diversity","Lori Gonzalez has a heart for the homeless, but, alas, the book contains too many similar stories, and a shorter book would have helped it. I was thirsty for more diversified stories, and as my reading continued I found myself looking at the page numbers far too often. Also, editor(s) did not catch all the grammatical errors."
5,"Great Music, Great Re-Mastering, Questionable Bonus Tracks","Theres not much to say about this album. Its a very good record and a favorite of mine. Amazon dosen't list the bonus tracks, which are in this order; Part of You, Find Out, Peekaboo! (Dance Velocity), Peekaboo! (Devo Dub, Here to Go (Go Mix Version), and Here to Go (Here to Dub Version.) All good tracks, except why are these two remixes of Here to Go on Oh No! It's Devo? These should be on the Infinite Zero reissue of Shout, where the Here to Go song came from. Very weird. It would of balanced out the bonus tracks better. Other wise this CD is excellent. I highly recommend it. I wish Infinite Zero re-issued all of Devo's WB catalog like this and shame on Rhino for not remastering all of the albums!"
3,A fun album from a fun band,"Devo enjoyed what they did as musical visual artists...their videos were cutting edge and pushed the boundaries of the early MTV age, the tunes here are fun."
3,be warned,"These devo reissues are bland , no inner artwork to speak of and missing all the bonus tracks that the infinate zero issues had . Please Mr. Henry Rollins bring back the goods . Infinate zero did a great job and these just dont live up ."
4,DEVO did it again... but,"First and foremost: I LOVE THIS ALBUM... although is not as good as ""New Traditionalist"". DEVO went straight into mainstream pop without even notice it. This album is filled with very good songs like ""Time Out for Fun"", ""Out of Sinc"" and ""Patterns"", but one must wonder what went on their heads when they created such blunders like ""Speed Racer"" or ""Explosions"". However, this is an album for, well... TIME OUT FOR FUN, so don't waste your time analizing it. Buy this album ASAP if you like 80s pop."
5,It works flawlessly,"I was a little skeptical when buying this, but it works perfectly, like it wasnt even there. I did read reviews about hissing and interference, but I have not experienced any of that."
2,Mixed bag....,"I have mixed feelings about this item. When it works, it seems to do its job. The problem is however that every time I turn on the system this is connected to, I get no audio whatsoever out of the converter. I then have to disconnect the converter from the power outlet and reconnect and only then do I get audio. This happens about 75% of the time. While it does its job, it is a major annoyance every time it is used.And for the record, this is the third one of these I've owned with the same problem.If your budget is limited, this is a good low cost alternative. Keep in mind it will not work flawlessly."
2,"When it works, it works well","I, like another reviewer have difficulty getting this to work. I've only tested it with a single device (an XBOX), so I can't say for sure if it is this unit or the XBOX causing the problem. The XBOX worked fine when connecting to my stereo (Yamaha RXV-2400) directly, but my stereo is now in a media closet and I needed to send the signal there from the XBOX.It is being sent over high quality quad shielded RG6 cable with RCA adapters on each end, perhaps something in the length of the cable? But I don't know why it would work sometimes, and not others.Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. After disconnecting and reconnecting, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. More often then not it seems, that this does not work."
3,okay,"This book is okay. It's more of a ""comfort"" book that a pracitcal guide. If you need inspiration to actually start freelancing from home this book is for you. If you've been freelancing for a while and want solid advice you can safely skip this one."
4,"Stylish, roomy bag","After carrying this bag for several years, I've gotten numerous compliments on it (and even had friends go out and purchase the bag themselves!). The color and shape of the bag make it attractive, although the material it is made of (cloth on the outside) means it will start to fray after extended use. The plus side to the bag is that it has a roomy interior and can fit not just a laptop, but also more than your fair share of papers, folders, and even a large portfolio. The top is much narrower than the bottom of the bag, so if you have irregularly-shaped items, try to place them at the bottom. Overall, a great bag that can fit more than your laptop!"
1,Don't BUY !!,THERE IS NO WAY A 15.4 LAPTOP WILL FIT INSIDE 'THE SPECIAL PADDED CASE'.......I think I destroyed mine trying to get it to fit in for a trip. I would NOT recommend this product.
5,I like it.,"Im guuna keep this simple. Good album, great listen, has good depth and substance compared with a lot of other CDs out at the moment. A rewarding listen. Buy It. :)"
3,"It's not Crowded House, but It's Closer","If you loved Crowded House, you'll live this. Much better than their solo stuff, but not quite up to the old days.... Sigh."
3,So-so,"I really wanted to like this album, and I keep thinking that this is going to be one of those albums that takes a while and then suddenly hits you. Unfortunately, this is just a CD of mediocre songs. They try to salvage it with clever arrangements, but it just doesn't work. No hooks, no great vocals, pedestrian lyrics. Don't believe those that say this is anything other than a CD that will end up in the budget bin--and still won't be worth the money. I should have know better, the Crowded House albums only had one of two good songs on them. This one doesn't have any.Too bad, I really wanted to like this album."
4,It's always great to hear these guys,"I've been a Finns fan since their Split Enz days a quarter-century ago, and have enjoyed their music all through the various permutations and combinations. So I snapped up this new disc as soon as it appeared. My initial impression was, ""great musicianship, same infectious passion as before, but with some mediocre tunes."" But then I gave it another couple of spins (as I urge any other doubters to do), and am currently high on the CD. There are some real strong winners, from the catchy opener, ""Won't Give In,"" to the sweet and tender closing track, ""Gentle Hum,"" and many points in between. Most of the songs are melodic, Beatle-esque rock, but there are a few surprises, especially the crunch and energy of ""All God's Children."" In the end, though, the most enjoyable aspect of Everyone Is Here is the singing of Neil & Tim Finn, both in harmony and individually."
4,Wonderful if somewhat sentimental,"I've been a huge Finn fan since the 80's, but I've always felt much more connected to Neil's more obscure and poetic style of songwriting. Here we see the straightforward influence of Tim, I can't help thinking that the lack of mystery in the lyrics takes away from the magic I've so long associated Crowded House and Neil in particular. There are some real winners here (All God's Children, Edible Flowers, Gentle Hum-my favorite by far), but it is no Woodface by far. There nothing here that comes close to ""Four Seasons in One Day"", ""Weather With You"", or""It's Only Natural"". However, if both Neil and Tim had left the biz after Woodface, they would still have left an indelible mark on the world...and I so glad they are still going. Anyone who has a chance to see them live should take it, they are wonderful on stage."
4,perfect little case,this case makes me feel like my ridiculously expensive and tiny computer is completely secure. it is also astheticly pleasing. the only drawback is that there is really not much room to store the power cord or any accessories. but all is well. i love it.
5,Chilton Manual for 2001 Dodge Durango,"You can't go wrong with Chilton. I've bought one for every car I've owned over the last several decades. I know they have saved me quite a lot of money by learning how to fix my own car instead of paying the 'shop' prices. I bought this one for my daughter's recent purchase of a 2001 Dodge Durango. She got a really good deal on a really good car. The best she's owned to date! So I hope she will use this to keep it running good before something gets too far out of whack. Now if I can just get her to read the 'scheduled maintenance' section first.... While we were not in a hurry to receive this book I was a little dismayed that it didn't even ship until 6 days after the purchase on Amazon. Did not receive the book until about two weeks after purchase. I realize the seller saves a few pennies by sending it USPS Book Rate, But would like a faster shipping period than two weeks!"
5,Another quality train set!,"Thomas wooden trains are fantastic. They are well made, sturdy, and stand up to lots of use from kids. I also appreciate that Thomas engines and cars have faces on the front of them. These faces on the toys help my young train user identify the correct way to face the trains and get them to connect. He knows that the face is at the front of the car, and that's where it connects. While for engines like Bill and Ben this isn't a huge deal, this is a huge deal with the boxcars. We will buy more Thomas trains soon. Watch for cheap deals from Amazon Sellers, don't pay full price!"
4,See veggies in a new light,"The typical Vegetarian book takes one of two paths: (1) tofu and granola or (2) vegetable as art. This book, however, takes a different road and rethinks cooking with vegetables from the ground up. The recipes are of medium difficulty and there are no pictures, so some cooking experience is desirable. If you can appreciate the full variety of vegetables and think of them as building blocks for creating meals, you will enjoy."
1,Something Fishy About This Book,"Part of the reason that I and others buy vegetarian cookbooks (or ones labeled as such) is because we don't eat our fellow creatures, nor do we want to see them as a menu item.This book has bonito flakes, shrimp paste, anchovies, and fish sauce listed as ingredients and is, therefore, not even close to plant-based cuisine. We can only hope that the author, while still alive, did not serve unsuspecting people animal parts and secretions, marine life or otherwise."
5,Light Force 140 lights,"They have only been on our vehicle for a short time and have not been out at night, but we are very pleased with what we've seen so far. P Pratt"
2,Lock-Schmock,"I bought these things for one purpose: not losing my socket when it is extended way into the engine somewhere. The locking extensions will lock with one another, but will not lock any socket to the end -- they pull off just as easily. Spent a good chunk of money on extensions that do not really lock."
3,Not exactly as described,"I purchased this set along with the 3/8 set since I already had a 1/2 inch drive set. The picture is not what you get for the 1/4 inch drive. The locking mechanism is not a small button like it shows in the pic it is a larger ring that goes around the entire extension. My 3/8 set locks my sockets on great and yes they all have detents to lock my sockets on the extension, but you can pull the socket off by just pulling it away from the extension on the 3/8 set you cant do that. So if you really need a locking 1/4 inch set you may look elsewhere or be disappointed. On the other hand I do believe the 3/8 drive set was a good investment."
4,Meets Expectations,"These are typical Gear Wrench quality - a good value for locking extensions. Reviewing because of a comment about these not locking - it should be noted that many, but not all, sockets are made with the internal notch required for the locking mechanism to work."
1,"wrong, wrong, wrong","Vendor sent completely wrong cable in the wrong color, made no attempt to fix, got return authorized, had to mail at my own expense, then they cancelled the order....... so my net loss. Would not deal with these people."
1,Open package,It arrived in open package so I don't know had I paid new item price for a used item. Cable works.
5,The cable I needed at a great price.,"I bought a business card scanner that needed this male to male USB cable.It has worked flawlessly for a year now. If you need this configuration, I recommend this cable. Great price too."
5,"USB cable type A male/type A male, 2.0 version, 6 ft",Cable was exactly what we needed to connect a computer to a nearbyprinter. Well packaged and delivered quickly. I would recommendthis product and vendor to anyone
4,textbook for my Qualitative research 2 class,"This book was interesting to read. I found that I could sit and read and enjoy this book. The examples in it are specific, and although I am doing research in a field different from the examples, I find that they are interesting and thought provoking. I know that my interviewing skills are getting better from having read this book."
3,"Kind of odd, but not too bad","This is certainly an odd movie. It is a romance/thriller - not particularly scary, but maybe not a date movie either. Much of the plot is driven by historical events and pseudo reincarnation. Despite that, the movie is somewhat entertaining. The plot takes a few interesting twists and turns. The acting is passable, if not great. Obviously, the whole ordeal requires you to suspend disbelief (spirits, love at first sight, etc.), but if you do this movie turns out to be not so bad."
5,Great movie,"This is my favorite Nora Roberts movie! It is wondefully done and is not to be missed. Whether or not you believe in haunted southern mansions or not, when you watch this movie, you have to consider the possiblity. What a beautiful southern mansion. The main charactors, have great actresses and actors behaind them. Bravo for the screen play!"
1,"If you liked the book, you will hate the movie.",I love most Nora Roberts' books and have thought several of the movie adaptations were ok. But this one seemed really to left field of the book what with active ghosts and fortune tellers. I could have handled that if there had been some believable sparks between the main characters. I most likely won't be buying more of her movies.
4,Shadowrun is good.,"This game has to be my most favored game i have ever bought. I've been playing it for 2 years stright, now, and i have never gotten tired of it. Just make sure you have an Xbox Live account."
2,A disappointing game for the franchise,"Being a keen cyberpunk enthusiast, gamer and RPG player I had high hopes that this game would be an interesting game. Sadly, aside from the 6 training missions, there is no real solo game; the multiplayer game doesn't allow you to choose your server, rather allocating you to one that matches your skills. This proves particularly problematic when you pick up a version late in the release cycle as most other players are miles ahead of you and it takes ages to get onto a live game, at which time you get smashed. There don't appear to be clear leaderboards and there's not a lot of additional features to keep you playing it for long.Great license - disappointing execution. No RPG aspects, and really a poor cousin of a game like Quake. What a flop."
2,Shadow run = Shadow nap,"This is one of those games that fell far short of its potential. To start with its combination of magic/weapons is poorly implemented. Each of which has beed done far better in previous games....can anyone say Star Wars with force powers. This game feels clumsy. Damage modeling is horrible, I'm sure they prefer the longevity of players is preferred by some, but as for myself, I can't stand to pump round after round into a player and do little damage. Some of the effects are cool, like waking thru walls, but shouldnt be enuff to levitate this game from the bargin bin."
3,Windows Vista Stranglehold,"So here is a game that is called ""Shadowrun"" an old RPG that was great--yet it really doesnt resemble the classic RPG at all...seems to be a ""common"" game that uses a new technology of mixing Xbox360 players and PC players together--good idea--bad marketing scheme by making it require windows vista...Any games that require me to purchase an entire new Operating System will not be getting my money for anything. Macintosh isnt looking too bad now if this is the future selling tactics for Microsoft.Microsoft, check your mailbox, this game is being sent back to you."
2,What a disappointment,"Wow, I was excited when first saw Shadowrun was going to be released. I played the original RPG and the Nintendo version. All I can say is what a disappointment. Other than the name and some content, this game is nothing more than a first person shooter. I am a bit upset that I had to sign up with Microsoft Windows Live in order to even play the game. I have a very robust AMD 64-bit multiprocessor dual core system with 4GB ram, 5 terabytes of hard drive space, and a 1024mb video card. Performance under Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit edition was mediocre at best. I am very unhappy with this product and will be selling it on e-bay."
4,An Excellent Game!,"Definitely a good choice in gaming, especially for the multi-player enthusiast. Be forewarned: it only runs on vista. I dropped the overall rating for this a star because of it, but that should not be counted against the game itself. For anyone who already has vista (who bought a new computer recently or what have you), its a good purchase. Alternatively, if you own an XBoX 360, you might go with it there instead, as the online game play is equal and combined with pc users."
5,More than a spud,"I had a friend who had one of these years ago and I thought it was the coolest thing I had ever seen! It is nice to know that such a silly product has lasted through the evolution of electronic toys. Kids are wild about these clocks you will find them interested in science while not even realizing that they are. These spud clocks are safe, fun and kids love them!"
4,Works well and tastes great,I am very pleased with taste and quality of this product. I am sure you will enjoy the saving of lower price too. Shipped quickly!
1,Don't Buy this.,"This is the worst cover for this phone. Firstly does not fit, If forced, It keeps activating voice control. Keys do not work.I purchased and am returning this product..."
1,Sorry... worthless,"I liked the idea, but it wasn't designed properly. The buttons don't work through the plastic. Perhaps as someone else mentioned, it's because the Smart key is held down when the top piece is slid into place."
3,Worked but stopped,"This case was good when I first got it. But after a while of use I took it off then put it back on, only to find out it would no longer fit. It kept activating the voice command, so I had to throw it away."
3,Not premium,"Disappointment. The case had to be cut to open slots for the side buttons on the phone. It is a generic, not specifically for a Razr V3."
3,50%-50% Chance,"Bought two of these and in all fairness the one that I kept for me was awesome from day one. It fit like a glove, nice leather, and all features of the phone work very well. Unfortunately the one that I bought for a friend with the same exact phone as me did not work as well. The top part did not fit well, so bottom line, this product is a toss up, it may or may not work for you!! I was lucky and happy with my purchase!!"
3,so so..,It is an okay product. But dont ever buy the motorola razr phone. It is the worst phone I ever used.
1,Top cover disables RAZR,"I was very excited about the case; it fits very well. But the top cover does not have proper opennings for the Smart Buttons. As soon as I turn on the phone, the tight-fit top cover presses on the ""voice record"" smart key, and disables the entire keypad. I have to power off the phone altogther to exit the ""voice record"" mode.After my initial disappointment (I rated it with one star), I used a hair dryer to heat stretch the top cover. Problem solved. The case fits well, and the phone works. I change my rating to four stars."
2,Waste of money,"I thought it would be a good idea to buy this after reading the product description. It was a disappointment the moment I opened the package and started to fit my phone into the case. It is too small (especially the upper part) for the phone. If you try and force the upper part into place, you would end up pressing one of the ""smart keys"" permanently and the number pad wont work. Also, once you fit this thing in, the phone wont close perfectly and looks too bulky. If you bought the phone 'cos it is RAZR thin, then this case is not for you. It'll make the phone as bulky as any other. So, don't waste your money on this."
1,Worthless,Don't waist your money ... when I bought this item there were no reviews. Hope you would pay attention.
5,Perfect Fit! Good looks and Solid protectoin!,"Got this today in the mail. Nice tight fit. The Swivel Belt clip is a little large, but it works as advertised. I'd prefer if there was no ""knob"" on the back, where the clip connects, to make it more pocketable, but all in all this will keep the phone safe (already dropped it once) while looking good.Sure, others mentioned it adds some bulk, but it also adds protection and that's the reason I recommend this.5 stars!"
3,missing parts,"My grandson loves the lab. It, however, came missing one chemical needed to do some of the experiments. I sent an e-mail regarding this problem to ToySoup. To date have not received an answer. Chem Lab seems to be great fun but when getting ready to do an experiment you find you don't have the needed and promised chemical can be disappointing. Rating would be higher if it weren't for the missing chemical."
4,Another change of direction for Britain's greatest pop star,"Cliff Richard may be banned from all three of the nation's pop music radio stations for not being poppy enough, but this single, and arrangement of Somewhere Over The Rainbow taken out of context from the Meet Joe Black soundtrack shows that he has his finger on the pulse.If he had chosen to simply copy the traditional arrangements of this song (and Louis Armstrong's Wonderful World this would not have worked, since those songs are indelibly associated with Judy Garland and Louis Armstrong respectively. Instead, a new, light reggae with a relaxed vocal brings something fresh to the mix and makes this very different from the dozens of identikit Abba and Bee Gees cover versions now populating our charts.My dearest wish is that this recording will at last endear him to Americans, who are missing out on an awful lot!"
3,Marred by inclusivism,"The idea of this book comes from a scene from the 1979 film Hardcore (which I have not seen) in which a Dutch Reformed elder from Grand Rapids attempts to explain the five points of Calvinism to a prostitute at Las Vegas airport. Which raises a whole lot of questions, that this book attempts to explore: How does TULIP relate to everyday Christianity? Is Calvinism more that just the five points? Do we refer to the ""Reformed distinctives"" when we explain the gospel to non-Christians? I really enjoyed this book up to chapter 8, when Mouw's inclusivism bubbled to the surface."
3,A little slow,This is not what I expected. It is mainly a discussion of the TULIP principles. If that's what you're looking for then this is for you. I expected more of a story.
1,What? He claims to be a calvinist!!!,I have to admit that while the book was a little slow going early on I could go on. I could go on until the author decided to go rouge and move salvation by grace to salvation by works just because he his friends with a rabbi that's not a christian.
3,Intriguing but inclusivist,"This is an intriguing book about the relevance of the five points of Calvinism. It's great for the first seven chapters, and then Mouw's inclusivism bubbles to the surface."
2,not the basics,"I just started swimming and was expecting some "" how to swim better"" tips. This book is more about the next level, which is not bad, just not what I expected. It focuses on swimming's effect on the body, which is informative, but is mostly focused on comeptition etc. Not useful for a novice."
4,Wow; what a mix!,"I got the Laurel Canyon Soundtrack and sort of put it aside and never listened to it, just being content having a part of the movie that I adore. Recently, however, I took it out of its case, brought it out to my little car, put it in the CD player, and listened to it on my way to work.Boy, I was glad that I did.The weather here has just turned to summer. With my windows rolled down, I turned up the music, and it really felt like summer. I'm not saying that if you buy this CD, you will embody the spirit of summer. Rather, it's a great CD to play during the season (and out of, too).The music reminds me of, namely, Laurel Canyon the movie - a place that is eternally steamily warm and beautiful. Moreover, you can definitely tell that the music is from an arthouse, independent film, ranging from pop, to psychadelic, to fictitous, to French, to mellow. Definitely an original mix. You will be surprised by each and every song on the disc.I definitely recommend if you enjoyed the film."
5,Delivers through to the end!,"This is the first CD I have bought in a long time that was actually devoid of ""filler material"".Granted, you really need to see the movie to get the whole experience, but this CD would work well enough on its own.I challenge anyone to listen to Mercury Rev's ""In a funny way"" and not be singing it to themselves for days.From this spellbing beginning, through the Butthole's ""the Shame of life"", right on through the final track, this CD sets a mood, or should I say tone (or both). It just goes to show that quality music exists within a myriad of genres.Buy it, live it, love it."
3,"Yeah, where's ""Bonnie and Clyde""?","I agree with a previous reviewer who said that Serge Gainsbourg's ""Bonnie and Clyde"" (with Brigitte Bardot) ought to definitely be on this CD.I don't recall Eartha Kitt's track being in the movie.Great soundtrack, but I won't get it.(I just watched the movie -- I was really taken by that Gainsbourg thing.)"
2,title is misleading,"I was disappointed in this book. A few of the stories are interesting but I would not call camping in the backyard for an hour during childhood or kayaking the Hudson for an hour ""wild"" adventures. I also am turned off by some of the contributor's attmept at writing, trying too hard to be clever, and failing."
4,metal evolution rocks,"This documentary of the some of the 26 sub genre chart of metal. They show 11 genres, all 11 are amazing. My favorite episodes are: Early metal in the U.S, early metal in the U.K, glam, thrash, grunge,nu metal and progressive rock. Sam Dunn does a nice job interviewing music experts and metal legends. The Alice Cooper interview is one of the best interviews. Interviews with Ace Freely and Paul Criss from Kiss are awesome and funny. This show is an amazing, I recommend anyone who love metal, interested in metal or just a music fan watch this show, you are going to have fun and rock out at the same time."
1,Will wait for a proper release,"When this series was on TV a few months ago, I went out of my way to watch as little as possible, preferring to instead wait for the ""inevitable"" blu-ray release. What little I did see was quite good, so I was really looking forward to it. (I was a big fan of Sam's Headbanger's Journey doc a few years ago and this seems to be of the same caliber.)I'm pretty disappointed to find that not only was this only given a DVD release rather than blu-ray, they had to add insult to injury and make it a DVD-R of even lower quality than usual. Well, VH1 Corp, or MTV Networks, or Viacom or whoever the hell owns the show, I'm not biting. If you want my money, then give me a proper release.Good thing I read the reviews first, often I don't bother when it's something I already know I want. Thanks you guys.EDIT Feb 26, 2013: Just noticed that they actually did go ahead with a blu-ray release a couple of months ago; good on 'em. Ordered. Will update again after watching."
2,Good series -- poor quality discs,"I bought this DVD set hoping to finally see this series, which I missed on TV. But the first copy I bought had scratches, so I returned them. The replacement set has MORE scratches. I'm not sure if this is due to the fact that it's on DVD-R, but at any rate, I'm tired of spending money and shipping copies of this DVD back to Amazon."
1,Unbelievable... is all I can say about this dvd-r release...,"I was going to purchase this when I noticed that it is NOT a real 3 disc set. I SERIOUSLY can't believe this is a 3 disc dvd-r release for over $20.00, and supposedly full of glitches! I have paid around $25 for a REAL 3 disc set release. What is the deal with this crap? They are doing this with cd's now also!!! Stop this crap now!!!"
1,"There's no audio! I was sold a music documentary with no audio, not acceptable","I purchased this as a gift, and unfortunately it was more than 30 days before Christmas, so guess what? Amazon's return policy expired before he even opened it. The first opportunity to watch this was two days after Christmas, he popped it in the DVD player, and... no audio, at all. On all three discs, there is no sound whatsoever. This is unacceptable and I just lost the trust I had with making purchases from Amazon."
1,Death Metal? Grindcore? Hello????,Death & Grindcore Metal have been going 10 years longer than nu metal & grunge and you don't even cover these genres!!!!What a crock of shit!The most complex metal drummers plays in these genres (and some would say more complex than Jazz). Ya think it might be worth a mention?
2,Dissapointing to say the least,"Swedish television has just showned this serie, and after seeing all episodes I feel that the people behind it needs to learn much more about metal/ hardrock. Here's some examples whyIn the episode with 70's hardrock they not once mentioned some of the bigger bands of that era, such as Thin Lizzy, Uriah Heep, Ufo just to mention 3.And when they talked about heavy metal albums from 1980 not a word was said about Ace Of Spades, and apart from some smaller interwievs nut much has been said about Motorhead.And spending a whole program trying to find a connection between grunge and metal? Hadn't it been enough with just 5 minutes?And including Nickelback in another episode who is as much metal as Justin Bieber makes you wonder if these guys know wwhat metal is.So I would'n recommend anyone buying this DVD. Spend your money on something better such as the Thin Lizzy box or some other great bands records."
2,A burn? Give me a break - bought it - full of glitches,"Content wise this 3 DVD set is great, but because it's a burn and not the real deal there are all sorts of glitches with it - sound and picture wise.There's no reason this couldn't have been a bluray release with killer picture and sound.I am watching it now and there are some sound glitches as well as picture glitches.Not cool."
1,I WOULD buy if on standard DVD medium...,"This series was outstanding as my wife and I watched and enjoyed each episode on VH1 Classic, so this review would have been a 5 star if based upon content. I would have been MORE than willing to shell out a reasonable $25 or so for this series on standard DVD, but I refuse to even purchase it on DVD-R! Thank you to all who wrote reviews warning of this fact. I am very disappointed in all of the powers that have collaborated to allow such a good show/series to be produced on such an unacceptable and unprofessional medium of distribution to a paying public!Shame on you VH1 and Amazon... two names that I usually hold in high regard and have much respect for!"
1,DVD-R.... Seriously???,You have got to be kidding me... This gets a DVD-R release.... Pathetic!!! How about releasing this on Blu-Ray with tons of footage that didn't make the broadcast episodes???
2,Not Happy,I was going to buy this until I read the reviews. A DVD-R release ? I won't buy this. This was a great documentary and deserves a better quality release.
2,"Star Trek Fix, But...",The music on this CD does not seem to be the same music I've heard in the movies. It's on the flat and tinny side and missing that big screen sound: crisp highs and stomach-rumbling lows. The quality is more like what you would hear on a mediocre AM radio station instead of a good FM station.The case is beautiful though: really well done artwork and layout.Star Trek is great but I wish I had purchased a different CD for the music.
5,The Best of Five Films,"Of all the CD's I own, this is easily among my favorites. They got just about all the best themes from the first five Trek films on one album. Originally published as ""Star Trek: The Astral Symphony"", I first bought the cassette (under the original title) about four years ago and just recently upgraded to this CD.Definately worth purchasing for anyone who enjoyed the soundtracks from the first five movies."
5,great star trek music peformance,"I'm an original trekkie from the tv series, but I preferred the first five movies more, with the original cast. I always thought the music was inspiring and beautiful. This cd has terrific versions of those first five movies. I don't enjoy the later movies as much, so I was pleased to find this cd which concentrates on my favorite Star Trek films."
2,I didn't like it...,"Sold it awhile back.... kept ""The Buried Life."" Get it instead if you want an album from this band with some tunes that are bound to please...a lot."
1,Boring & Most Unimaginative books in the world!,"I grew up with these most boring and flat books in the world. How could a nation be subjected to this author if you can name this an author or teacher for this matter. Perhaps in Iowa these books could work but living on the Lower East Side in the 1950's and unable to relate to the characters, their parents and pets I had nothing in common with or their life style. Are you kidding me? This is a form of child abuse and propaganda to even suggest this superficial life or its uninteresting and colorless characters. I was subjected and forced to read and repeat over and over the same words that was uninspiring. How could young minds be subjected to this horror world of fiction?!![ Just their names alone, who knew a Dick or even a Jane? I knew Jose & Juanita. [ASIN:0448434113 Fun with Dick and Jane]]"
4,Even if you aren't familiar with Yiddish . . .,"Even if you aren't familiar with Yiddish this satire is good fun (and there is a glossary but it makes for slower reading and comprehension). I always HATED all of the Dick and Jane books in the early 1950's when I had to read them, and I thought it would be enjoyable to see some fun made of them. Unfortunately, the basic ""Dick and Jane past"" part of the book has been updated to ""now"", and ""now"" is not a kinder, gentler time. Dick and Jane's parents are no longer the perfect examples of how adults should be or behave! Never-the-less, it was a fun read. I hope it encourages more satire of the Dick and Jane books which were one of the worst ""slices of mediocrity"" ever used to assault the brains of innocent children."
4,Oy vey!! How could they leave out some very important words,"This is a cute book - very funny and creative. Even the definitions in the back are a hoot. But alas - they left out some very important and basic words, such as Schmuck, schvitz and the very un-pc but often used schvartze. Maybe they just had problems in the ""S"" section."
3,Funny for Yiddish Speakers,"Dick and Jane are back in another parody. Now they are adults and speaking Yiddish.There are plenty of simple Yiddish jokes here but they are far more effective if you already know the Yiddish terms. The dialogue is similar to the originals but not really true to form. Unlike the original Dick and Jane tales the definitions are not readily obvious. There is a glossary at the back but once you get back and forth, the joke may not be so funny.Loaded with more adult terms and situations this is not a book for children (as we found out when my five-year-old received a copy).If you already have a handle on some common Yiddish, you might get a chuckle out of this one."
4,Caught in two worlds,"This is a must read for anyone who struggles with homosexuality; living a double life and feeling alone. The author allows you to journey with him as he deals with guilt,anguish,frustration,shame,isolation and fear. This man juggled two lives, completely opposite poles apart, paid the consequences and is transparent about his struggle.Counseling with people that deal with like issues, it has offered me a front row view of personal suffering."
4,a good resource,I found this book after losing my father a few weeks ago. I have found it to be a helpful resource and a comfort. The author uses simple language and short sections. The sections are divided so that a person can easily find the topic most needed without reading the enitre book. Highly recommended.
2,Not worth the read,"This book is just not worth reading in my opinion. It pretty much states what anyone would know, about how one may feel after a loss"
5,fast service,"As I have not read the book yet, I can't give it a fair review. But I will say, I have had positive communication with the author who suggested I read the book.Because I was taken to task about a review in which I said I had not read the book, I don't feel it fair that I comment further."
1,Not like their previous album or EP!,"This review is for everyone who got into Sea Of Green because of their ""Northern Lights"" EP or ""Time To Fly"" album. You probably like/love Sea Of Green because you are fans of bands like Kyuss and/or Queens of the Stone Age, and if so, read this review.I immediately bought Sea Of Green's ""Chemical Vacation"" thinking that it would be as good as ""Time to Fly,"" but I was completely fooled and wrong.This album is absolutely terrible. They have changed their sound completely: the riffs are alright, but nothing CLOSE to their previous works, and the vocals are horrendous. I guess the singer decided to take the most cliche path that most commercial bands take and try and sound like William DuVall [Alice In Chains]. Unfortunately, unlike DuVall, Sea Of Green sounds like an amateur band made up of 14 year-olds. And the lyrics... what the hell happened?! How did it get so bad?!I would strongly suggest listening to this album before buying it."
5,Nike Juice,"I love this ball. To bad Nike stopped making them just when I discovered the Juice 312.It put 20 yds on my shots. They putt just as well as Titleist. When I run out of the onesI have, my second best is Titleist Velocity's."
5,Great Spark Plugs,It may increase mileage but I can't verify this but it seems like it does increase horse power. I must add that my old spark plugs were overdue to be replaced and had twice the gap that it is supposed to have due to them being being so used. I do recommend these NGK laser Platinum Spark Plugs. They seem to be doing well for me and they say they will last a very long time. I am happy with them.
4,Best Spark Plug i ever bought,"This is the best Spark Plug i ever bought. The car performanse of my car has increase considerabilty, it runs faster and it`s giving me more mileage per galon of fuel. i recommend this product for the honda civic 2002."
5,Like reading a mystery story,"If you keep in mind Sherlock Holmes testing his hypotheses to unraveling a mystery, you will get through this well written and provocative book with less sturm and drang. And if you're a fan of Egyptian pharoahs, here's a different way of thinking about Joseph, Moses and Jesus. Laidler takes us through ancient exiles to druidic Ireland, Robert the Bruce's Scotland, Dagobert's France, and Solomon's Jerusalem, among the primary settings of this mystery, in search of the Holy Grail. Using a lengthy bibliography and many footnotes, as well as over 2 dozen photographs and pictures, it's up to you to decide if he's proved his case. An open mind helps."
2,Leaked,"Water got into the unit, then leaked back out while using it. Then it would not hold a charge. Returned for refund."
4,Interesting book on Algerian extremists in France,"Interesting book, mostly on Algerian Islamicist extremism overseas and its links with extremists from other national groups. Sifaoui is an anti-Islamicist journalist from North Africa. The book is less about al-Qa'ida per se than about the Algerian Islamicist networks, but given the informality of 'al-Qa'ida', it is the more meaningful for it.A book that goes well with this book is Abd Samad Moussaoui's ""Zacarias Moussaoui, mon frère"" (translated as ""Zacarias Moussaoui: the twentieth man?"" in the USA and as ""Zacarias Moussaoui: The making of a terrorist"" in the UK). Moussaoui, the brother of a French-Moroccan arrested immediately after 9/11, tries to explain why he thinks his brother became a terrorist. Thought-provoking."
5,Use them all the time with Thule rack -- these are longer than Thule pads,"I use with Thule rack on 1999 Acura Integra GSR. Have a wide windsurf board, these crossbar pads are a few inches longer than Thule. Use them all the time."
3,He hasn't grown.,"Well, it looks like Eagle Eye Cherry is not planning on releasing his newest album in the US. Fortunately, if you go to www.eagle-eye-cherry.com, you can listen to real audio files of the new album. But, before you run off, don't expect much. Where ""Desireless"" gave us the jazz, fusion, pop melodies of Eagle Eye Cherry, his last two efforts have been relatively flat. Just like on ""Present Future"", there are some catchy tunes, but nothing groundbreaking. And it looks as if ""Desireless"" was a big hoax. An unrequited promise of what might have been. We at least have to wait another album to see, but with this latest release, it does not look like he may ever get there."
3,Not easy to clean,I hate that the cups don't just rinse off. I was told not to put them in the dishwasher so cleaning can be a pain. I still use them though.
2,"Non-stick, my butt!","These are awfully cute, but picking mini-cupcakes out of them is a torture; they stick like crazy, and they DO NOT rinse easily: you have to wipe the stuck sweet batter from all the ridges by hand, as the dishwasher won't get it out. You need a small round brush to make it easier, and even then, consider how much time you want to spend cleaning them. (The dishwasher will also scatter them all over, because they're too small to stay in one place.) If you try to get the cupcakes out while they're still hot, a cup might tear. They might be useful for making tiny appetizers - omelets, crabcakes - but for baking, I'm getting a 100-pack of disposable paper cups."
2,not non-stick at all,I used these supposedly non-stick cupcake cups exactly once. My cupcakes didn't release at all (the recipe has worked fine with paper cupcake cups since then). They were also such pain to clean that I ended up saying 'why bother' and chucked them. Don't waste your money on these things.
5,Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry is simply the best one.,The Lehninger Princicples of Biochemistry is the best book in biochemistry that has been written. I have use it in my biochemistry course in my first year in school medicine and thanks to this book I pass my class with one of the best notes in the group. Any other book exposes the biochemistry principles with clarity and coherence like the Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry. I can't wait for the 4th edition.
5,The BEST Introductory Textbook In Biochemistry...,"This text in Biochemistry is a great introduction. I was quite familiar with Lubert Stryer's masterpiece but I must confess this textbook goes one step further. The slant is towards the med student and the notes on medical aspects are just plain fantastic. It took me almost a year to finish the book but the effort was well worth it. Besides I have been out of touch with Biochem since my college days. Aspects of RNA metabolism are plain fantastic!! What is more the layout and sequence of topics is just right. I found that using this text in conjunction with ""Basic Medical Biochemistry"" by Marks, Marks, and Smith will give you the best mix. Don't pass on this gem. It truly is worth your time and perusal. The cost is steep but textbooks usually are. Grab it!!"
2,nor for serious biochemists,"This book is nicely illustrated, but you will be frustrated if you try to prepare for your examination based on this book. reaction mechanisms are not there, the details are scarce, and important points are too often omitted. only suitable for those who will only do one biochemistry course."
5,Turtle loves'em,"I got these to feed my bearded dragon, sadly if the food isn't either a leafy green vegetable or a moving insect, he won't eat it.I then looked at my two turtles, a 2 year old red bellied cooter and a 1 year old razorback musk. I figured what the heck, and tossed some in. They wound up eating the whole can. I've never seen them eat anything as greedily."
2,"Overpriced, starts to sag","I owned this model for about two years. It's cheap and plasticky. The weight of the cord tends to drag it off the table.After the first year, the joint where the microphone connects to the base wore out and it no longer stayed in the position it was placed in, meaning it always drooped.Audio performance was okay, but nothing to write home about, especially if you're using it for gaming or something where fidelity isn't a huge issue. And for just $20 or $30 more you can get much higher-quality mics with steel bodies, etc. If this was $10 or $15, it would be a great buy, but at $40 (the price I currently see it at) it's a rip-off."
4,Great mic for the price,"Great mic, great sound quality. I use it for online gaming. Only down side is that since it's a desk mic it seems to pick up a lot of keyboard noise while you're talking/playing.Mic sound quality is better, though, than the last two headset mics I have purchased. My voice comes through clear."
3,Volume gain controls within various programs.,"The microphone was easy to install, and worked straight out of the packaging. However, when used with various voice chat systems in conjunction with assorted videogames, the output volume changes significantly with each game. This has been a hassle, and I believe to be caused by the use of the USB connection. This problem was not experienced with my prior microphones connected to a sound card.If you have a sound card or on-board sound I would recommend using those in conjunction with a non-USB microphone. This microphone should only be used by users that are forced to use a USB connection."
2,Flaky in Win7,"Plugged it into my Win7 computer, did not install and Windows stopped the device. Tried it again and it crashed the computer. Tried plugging it into the motherboard USB and same problems. Uninstalled it, rebooted, plugged it into one of the front USB ports and it installed and worked - just like it was supposed to - fantastic I thought. Unplugged it and plugged it into the motherboard USB and same problems above. Gave up on the Win7 computer for now.Plugged it into the laptop running XP, it installed and worked perfectly, unplugged it, plugged it back in - perfect.Logitech forums are no help, there are no drivers to be found, and from the looks of you either get lucky with Win7 and it works or it keeps crashing. I plan to try again with the Win7 machine but once it works, I won't unplug it. For now though, I'm a little disappointed that it is not as easy as some of the other Logitech devices I've used in the past."
1,Terrible,"I needed this for my class, After Effects to record a narrated movie I made. Unfortunately the only way to save this was a WMA file. Adobe After Effects CS3 does not accept this file format. There is no way to save in Real Time or Quick Time or even mp3. It was a total waste of money. I am completely unsatisfied.Linda"
4,so far good,plug in and play download itselfi believe the price should $7.65 very light easy to usethe cable long enough to talk from somewhere
3,Average mic,"Honestly, I expected something a little better from Logitech. I have purchased other products from them, and they are all fantastic. Alas, I guess this is what you get for $20. Provided, it works, and is good for Skype calls and the such. However, it isn't good for using on a project. Just my thoughts, buy it if you wish."
2,just ok,"i don't think this product values this price. I buy it for internet calling, but i don't think there are any change after i use it."
1,Does not work,I bought this because I trust Logitech products. It worked a couple of times but completely stopped working after that. Not sure if I received a defective product. Wanted to return it but I already chucked the package. What a waste of money!
1,Useless,"We bought this mike largely on the basis of the good reviews it got -- just plug it in and it works, they said. Nope. Maybe our one was made last thing on a Friday, because after calls to Logitech's help line and a visit from a local computer specialist the darned thing still wouldn't work. At least Amazon took it back without a quibble. OK, statistically (going by the reviews) it's a good mike, but of course statistics don't apply to the individual item, and I guess we just got a bad one."
1,Only worked for 5 minutes,"I was able to install and configure this mic just fine. However, after about 5 minutes the quality degraded and eventually became un-usable. I could unplug the USB cable and re-plug and it began to work just fine. Yet, as before, after 5 minutes the quality degraded, began to sound "" ""staticy"" and eventually the audio faded away into complete static.I bought this through Circuit City. I was disappointed to see their terms of return as they asked that manufacturer be contacted to get their authorization to return it. I find these terms to be rather onerous and wrote them to let them know. I have yet to hear back from them. If I get a response, I will post the results here.UPDATE: I contacted Circuit City via Amazon Marketplace. They issued me a return authorization number. For that I am thankful. Thanks Circuit City!Still, I am surprised by Logitech's quality in this case. I always thought they made good products."
2,Flimsy,"My dog knocked it over one time and it never worked right again. It didn't hit the floor hard at all, but it never worked right again.My friends said I sounded muffled on Skype and Dragon had no idea what I was saying."
1,Does not work with Windows 7 64bit,"This will install on your Windows 7 64bit computer but the volume will be so low it's worthless, even at volume 100. There is no mic boost option available either so there is nothing you can do about it. You have to basically be a few inches away from the mic for others to hear you."
1,WIN 7 - TRY YOUR LUCK,"A lot of people saying it works on WIN 7, and a lot of people say it doesn't work. Here is my experience. FYI, I have been a IT for years and I know my hardware and software. I plugged it, it automatically detected USB connection and installed the driver. Turned on Skype and tested it. It works but the other person will not be able to hear anything you say unless you talk directly into microphone. Even then it's so faint it gets very frustrating. Tried to look for work around solution on the internet and drivers. Nothing.Their official website does not offer WIN 7 Drivers.Try your luck. Some say it works some say it doesn't.It did not work for me."
1,The plastic stick is broken on arrival,"The plastic stick is broken on arrival. Have to use duck tape to fix it. It still works, not worth the trouble to return it, but I am not happy with it."
4,Microphone for MAC,"I've only been using it for about a month now and my wife and I love it for it's ease of installation, ease of use and good sound quality.We both have Macs and use them from different rooms in our house. We use SKYPE and turn off the video, just using the audio. Works great forstaying in communication. I would recommend them to anyone needing a microphone that can be muted easily, needs to be away from the mainlaptop and has very good quality."
3,"Good, but not great","I have been using this microphone for the past two weeks for webchats on my G5 iMac. I was persuaded to purchase this item because of all of the positive reviews, and the fan on my iMac created background noise on the built-in microphone.Although I like the design, the sound quality is not as good as I would have expected, and there is quite a bit of ambient sound picked up in recordings. Even when placed within 12 or so inches of my mouth, I would say that the sound quality is only marginally better than that of the built-in microphone on my iMac.Although more convenient than a headset, my headset produces much better results."
2,Overrated,"After reading the reviews for this item I was excited to try it and was in need of a low-end microphone. I have one of headset ones and it has the same quality with LOTS of noise and poor recording. I compared it to the integrated one on my laptop and that one is better! It may be that I don't know how to mix things properly for sound recording. But I thought that based on all the comments that this would be a great, out of the box item that I could just plug in and use with any Windows program, Audacity, or other audio program. Terrible background noise no matter how far I am from it and what I do. It sounds like the person talking through the static on the TV in Poltergeist! I tried it on two computers to determine if the sound card made any difference. It did not.Glad it was on sale, but not that I got it."
4,Great for the Price,"It's nothing fancy, but it does what I need it to do, reliably and with decent sound quality. If you're looking for a basic microphone to use for online chat, voice recordings, and the like, this is a great choice."
3,"More or less good, not that good...","I bought this microphone two days ago and I began using it right away , while it is a good microphone for voice I dont recommend it to record music. Most of the frecuency range is ok for voice...hey dont expect miracles here, you will get a good level to use for voice recognition , but when you use the sound recorder the volume is sadly low.I have to admit this one is one of the best mics you can find in this price range , it is far better than those cheap and crappy gooseneck mics the ones you have actually to shout and place them inside your mouth!!!,but I think with technological era we are living in , there must be better mics in this cost/benefit range....."
5,"Great USB Mic, great price",Length:: 0:52 MinsThis video will demonstrate the audio quality of this mic. It will also show that it works in Vista.
3,Needs more distance range,"All the great reviews had me hopeful about this inexpensive microphone. I had planned on using it for Skype calls. It installs very easily within seconds.The problem is that it has very little distance range. I found that even after experimenting with all the settings in Skype and Windows control panel (with the volume all the way up), I still have to place the mic no more than 2 feet away. Farther than that it is too quiet, weak, soft.It is interesting that my laptop's cheap, built-in mic had perfectly adequate range from 3 or 4 feet away before it failed."
3,Noisy Mute Button,"If you jiggle the mute button while the light is on, a loud audible noise is heard, and is incorporated into the digital output stream. This is a very bad thing for someone who frequently uses the mute button. I'm surprised so many people haven't noticed this, but it is a serious design flaw for the analog section to be picking up this noise.Other than that, the audio qualities are excellent for a $20 desktop mic. Almost no hiss, good directionality, and good fidelity."
4,"Decent Microphone, Not Amazing","I use Dragon Naturally Speaking to dictate my old handwritten journals into text files (to ultimately be printed and bound.) I was having trouble with the microphone that came with the program and an even worse time with the second ""headset"" microphone I bought.I decided to get this, a simple, easy tabletop microphone to use instead. It has been amazing so far. After only doing one accuracy training (instead of several) I found that Dragon Naturally Speaking was swiftly and accurately typing what I spoke. There are a few errors here and there and sometimes the microphone seems to be picking up background noise a little too loudly.If you are looking for an easy, affordable microphone to use, go for this one!"
5,Logitech mic,Great product that was shipped in a very safe box. Happy with everything it arrived in a reasonable amount of time and the price was right.
2,Clean Audio Quality but Poor Gain,"I was wanted to improve on my computer's call quality in Lync by switching from the Logitech Orbit Webcam's built-in microphone to this one. But while the audio quality was good, the volume was way less than that of the Orbit. I went back to using the Orbit."
5,makes us sound good,"Although I have not heard what we sound like on this device, I'm told this usb microphone sounds great.We put in the middle of the conference room table and use it for group Microsoft meetings.Easy to use (plug it into the usb) and is cost effective."
2,Lousy Mic,"I like this mic, tried it out while playing games the other day and people said it was clear. The mute button is pretty cool, and the button lights up green so you know when you are on. Seemed to pick up pretty well during a pretty chaotic game. No complaints other than my playback from skype seemed a bit more bandwidth limited than i would have liked, but that was probably skype deign it for transmission speed reasons.EDIT: I now think this mic is horrible. I have bought a webcam to replace it, and realize that this picks up very little, and is hard to use. you basically have to have your mouth right on the diaphragm for it to pick up anything useable. Would not recommend."
4,Nice mic,"Works great!!! I use it to record machinima and this mic is great. Youre not ganna get a better mic unless you Plan on spending hundreds of dollars for a super mic or something. The ONLY downside is that I've seen some really cool looking mice before, and this isnt 1."
4,Good little mic,"I just made my first skype call and used this microphone. It met my limited needs and basic functionality. It has a useful button to be sure the mic is off which is good for me and also I just have to plug it in to use it with minimal effort and no discs. I did notice that my Vista Home 64-Bit PC I built has a little trouble confirming proper sound when I speak into the mic. What I mean by that is when I go to test the mic in windows ""Set Up A Microphone"" it wasn't easy to get it to register the sound, but in actual use I didn't get any complaints from my skype call friend.My only real complaint is that it isn't easy to find a place for in on my desk when I'm talking on it I have to move my keyboard which is annoying.."
5,Great Mic for a Great Price,"I am new to voice recording, and this specific microphone was recommended to me by voice over talent agent Jeffrey Umberger. I had to rush and complete my first audition for a voice over gig, and setup and installation were both easy. My mic is set up in the living room area, where background noise is easily heard. Despite this, the mic did not pick up any outside noise, only my voice."
5,Good Mic,This is a really good mic. I just had to plug it in and it installed itself. It works wonderfully.
4,Microphone,"I ordered this item for my mother so we can continue to keep in touch while i'm deplyed. She can set it up, anyone can."
1,Mute button does NOT work,"I've been using this microphone happily for many months but just discovered something very surprising: The mute button DOES NOT WORK. Sounds are diminished, but not silenced when on mute. I discovered this by accident when talking to someone on my computer - he told me that he could hear me having a side conversation with someone else when I thought I was on mute. This is very disturbing for any telephony use. Be careful."
2,microphone,"This product is exactly what it is. While a nice addition to use, in my estimation to sensative to the slightest sound.keybord stokes,my touching even the desk it sat on tranmitted that sound.also even adjusting the stand it sits on was noisy.If you want just something to talk with or have fun,this product is ok.If you want more serious voice transmision,I'd pass on this one!"
3,"Not great, not bad","I am using this on a Mac Pro, and the only issue I have with this is the volume. I really need to be close to the mic in order to record in a reasonable volume, and even then its still low. Otherwise, it was great to just plug it in and start using it.I would only use this mic for voice recording (screencasts, youtube, etc.). I would not recommend this for any kind of music or music vocal recording."
1,HEED windows 7 64 warnings.,"I'm easy going. If something is a bit not right, I'll make do. This just flat out failed. Even Logitech's web site offers NO solution.Apparently this mic is for older software like Windows XP.Don't waste your time."
1,CRAP! With a capital C!,"I am so mad it didn't work, when I plugged it in to my computer and hit the button to turn it on the light came on for like 5 seconds and the it was off, I read the booklet front and back to make sure I wasn't doing anything wrong, it acted as if a battery was dead but it doesn't work off batteries. So I don't recommend this product, I'm shipping it back ASAP! It sucks!"
4,The mike works well,"The microphone is convenient (hands free and you are not wired to your desk) and the sound quality is good according to the people I talk to.One problem I have and I don't know if it is the mike or my Mac: sometimes the light stops working. If I reboot or unplug/replug the USB cable it starts working again. Even if the light isn't on, the mike still works when the button has been pressed. It is just harder to tell that it is depressed."
4,logitech usb desktop microphone,I love it. It seem to work much better than the four others I have used; and it cost the much less.
1,Another disappointed Windows 7 user,"I read a lot of amazon reviews before purchasing this microphone, but I should have paid more attention to the troubles specific to Windows 7 64-bit. When I plugged it in it was recognized immediately, but when I try recording on sound recorder I get such a faint sound on playback you can hardly tell it's supposed to be a voice recording. I also tried using it with Snap 5 screenshot recording with video, and the sound playback is still barely audible. If I speak loudly and hold the microphone very close to my mouth, the playback is still very muffled and you mostly hear puffs of breath. That's the best I could get it with the troubleshooting I was able to do. Logitech's support site has no help at all for Windows 7; it stops at Vista. I'm very disappointed."
5,A GREAT Product,I've purchased MANY mics in the past only to be disappointed ... this item is EXCELLENT with super sound qualities ... the USB connection really makes it nice not having to plug into the back of the sound card etc ... the only thing I have experienced that is not handy is that some programs do not recognize USB for narration on the fly ... however ... overall this is a 10 +++
3,Wears Out For Full Time Telecommuter,"I'm a full time telecommuter and we are on voice chat all day. I've gone through two of these in 1 year. What happens is the mute button circuitry seems to get flaky and worn out and voice tends to bleed through then.Bottom line, when it's in this state you can't trust that you are totally muted using the lighted switch."
5,Good quality and easy to use.,"This is a very great mic for the price. When I bought it, the shipping was very quick, and I was happy to get my hands on a new mic. This mic, however, was very hard to get to work on my Windows XP SP3, but eventually got it working. However, this does not contradict the fact that this is a very good mic with very good quality for a very good price. I would recommend this to people, and I have found out my friends have already been using this."
1,Volume Problems,"The microphone works, barely.If I bend over, and put my face right next to the microphone, then it will record at low volume. If I am more than 1 inch away, it's very quiet. And if I sit up, with the microphone pointing directly at me (the normal setup for a microphone like this), you can barely make out that someone is talking. Understanding the words is impossible.And this is with the input volume for this device turned up to maximum. (and I tried it on two different types of computers. Same on both).I've searched for work-arounds and fixes, but it appears that it's just poor quality control. Some of them just don't work, and mine is one of them.I guess this is what I get for buying a cheap microphone. Maybe I'll tryBlue Microphones Yeti USB Microphone. A little higher end, might actually work."
1,Why are these so awful for me?,"I bought two of these so far. One a few months ago, and one just recently for my brother. The first one was so sensitive it would pick up sounds outside the house. It would pick up every single non human sound and didn't cancel any of that out. I could scratch my head and it'd come through the microphone really loud and clear.This next one I got, it's not sensitive at all. I can be speaking two feet from it and it sounds like I'm from across the room.Two times I've been screwed on these damn things. Why such a huge difference in quality? Why can't I find a happy medium?"
5,Works Great windows 7 64,This microphone is excellent. I am running windows 7 64 and am using it to make Google voice calls. Great buy.
4,Good for the price.,Much better than headphones. Works well. Good product for the price. zz zz zz zz zz zz zz z .
5,Easy to install-sould quailty is excellent! Great USB Microphone!,"This LOGITECH USB Microphone is well made and easy to install. Just plug into a USB port and go! The mike has a light that comes on when the mike is active and ready to use. It has great sound quality and I am very happy with my purchase. In addition, I have used this microphone in PowerPoint and also in other programs where I need to narrate and the sound quality is excellent. The best this is the ON and OFF switch at the base of the microphone which is a feature found on the more expensive microphones. So I 100% recommend this microphone."
1,Vista a no-go,Not sure how many people who have vista got this thing to work; but count one more who didn't. Pretty annoying such a simple piece of hardware can't work on a widely popular OS.
1,Poor sound quality,Very poor sound quality. I have a cheap drugstore non-USB microphone that sounds much better. Dissatisfied with product and have returned for refund.
1,Useless garbage,"Does not work at all with Dragon NaturallySpeaking 11. I am in an environment with low background noise, but Dragon could not understand anything I said into the microphone, whether I held it at 2 feet away, 1 foot away, an inch away, or literally in my mouth. Created a new user profile; this changed nothing. Other reviewers have mentioned the need to disable all other microphones first, but this step does not help -- if you do disable your other microphones and enable this one, then Dragon thinks there are no microphones on your machine at all.Will be returning immediately.Lesson learned. You get what you pay for, unless you buy this lousy product, in which case you don't even get that.I'm on Vista-32."
3,Works just fine,This product did what I needed. My sister can hear me now when we do live chats. No problems so far. Works great.
1,Logitech mic,"Great packaging, but lets face it, if it arrives ok, who cares about the box size.. Plug it in, done. except....i had to yell to get any recognition from it. went through all the pc settings i can find to make changes if applicable but still, have to yell to be heard using this mic...bad purchase...Also, in the user manual, it says using a windows operating system of Win 98, ME, and XP, so this must be old old since i have windows 7. I re-read the info on this from Amazon, didnt say anything about operating systems so it may be no good for my pc...nice to know after the fact..."
3,Good mic - but only records in MONO,"This is a decent microphone. It sounds good and looks good. It can record good from a distance and cracks and pops are virtually nonexistent.However, it only records in mono. This means it records only in a single channel as opposed to stereo which records in dual channels. So the quality isn't great.This mic is good for chatting online perhaps, but if you want to record audio for a documentary, commercial, etc, or anything professional, I recommend you try another product."
1,Does Not Work W/ Vista... Beware...Blue Screen of Death!,"We got a new Dell Desktop 6 days ago, after having it for only 6 days I got the blue screen of death, so because I was within my 14 days refund/exchange period w/ the store I was told by the Geek Squad to just bring it in for a refund or an exchange, so I took it in thinking I had a lemon PC, and I got a Gateway instead as I was worried about getting another Dell, well I got the Gateway home today 6/18/09, and set it up installed all my personal stuff then later in the day plugged this microphone in and guess what...the blue screen of death popped up again, then I realized it wasn't the PC at all it was this stupid microphone that was messing up my PC, So I didn't have a lemon w/ Dell. Oh well now I know and I will have to see if I have to restore this new Gateway to the factory settings if it did any damage. DO NOT GET THIS!!!!!"
1,Drivers missing,"Do not purchase this microphone unless you want a hassle installing it. As yet, I have not been able to get it to install with Windows XP including Service Pack II. I finally located the number of the microphone and see that installation problems date back a few years. A CD with the appropriate driver should come with this microphone. It did not. Look elsewhere.LHerr"
2,Not worth the Money,This was not worth the money that we spent on it. My youngest used it about 4 times before it broke. We finally bought another computer and it has a built in speaker so we don't need to replace it.
3,"Ok for the money, but probably better ones around","This was very easy to set up and use. I am not familiar with microphones, but here are two things I found which I considered negatives.1. Certain letters were muffled upon playback. I understand this can be a problem with microphones, but if I had done additional research and found another which didn't have this problem (and did not cost an arm and a leg), I would have purchased that instead. I read online that if you stretch a stocking and hold it away and in front of your mouth that this solves the problem...and it did!2. I was trying to read a script from my computer. I found the height of the device was too low. It would have been nice if it extended so that I could have made it taller.The voice quality was quite good."
3,"Ok, But Broke Pretty Fast","For all the praise this gets, it broke within 4 months. The sound is average, very easy to setup and use. But its lack of reliability caused me to miss several podcasts. I will not buy this product again. 3 stars, nothing more. For [...] bucks it should last a bit longer."
2,worked great until it broke,"Worked great until it broke. Had it for about 3 months, always handled it very carefully, but then it just stopped working right... The audio it was picking was extremely faded/distorted/weird, and ultimately unusable. :("
2,Just OK,"I really should have done more homework before I purchased this product. What I really needed was a mic to record meetings around a conference table. But what stuck me later was that this unit's boom-type mic didn't provide better quality over an integrated mic-headset unit. If I have to stay close to a mic, why limit my mobility with a table-top unit?"
1,"No noise cancellation, W7?","I bought this thinking that it would improve noise cancellation over my headset. I was a streamer at the time, and viewers complained sometimes about being able to hear me breathing, my keyboard typing, or sirens outside.This microphone was even worse, plus added awkwardness in setting up because it needed to be on a surface. I looked for solutions to quantify my purchase, but it seems the noise cancellation doesn't work for W7. I just said screw it eventually and gave it to my roommate and continued using my headset."
3,"For simple recording, it's ok","I got this for simple recoding and it does what I expect. Truthfully, I wasn't expecting much. However...#1:I can't seem to position it to avoid breaths and pops. #2:I wish it had come with software for recording/simple editing. If I knew then what I knew now, I would have gone with a better mic."
5,very good,the product i bought arrived in perfect conditions. working perfectly well. the product arrived on time. after comparing the price with other stores i found out that the price was very good as well
4,It's not bad.,"There's nothing bad that I can say about this microphone. I took off one star because sometimes it'll just turn off, or it refuses to turn on, even though it's plugged into my netbook. If I unplug it and plug it again that usually fixes the problem. That's the only annoyance about it.For some reason the recordings came out with SUPER low volume. I was worried that I was stuck with almost-mute recordings until I found out that the microphone volume was at 10% in the settings. So weird. I bumped it up to 65%.I can speak into the mic at a reasonable distance (like 6 inches or so) and I sound very clear with no background noise at all. I am very satisfied."
4,you get what you pay for,"The microphone does what it's supposed to do. I use it for computer gaming with my friends so we can chat while we play. Most of them complain about how quiet the microphone is but luckily most mediums of communication have ways to increase the volume.It is also much larger than i thought it would be, around 8-9 inches high and the base is about 2.5 square inches. Despite this it isn't that difficult to set it up on my desk.In conclusion i would recommend this microphone to anyone else with only about 20 dollars to spend on a microphone for recreational use. It's cheap and does its job but if you have the money i'd do some more research and get something a little better in regards to the output sound quality."
5,Excelente Cámara!,"La cámara resultó ser mejor de lo que pensé; un poco pequeña y cable no muy largo, pero tiene excelente calidad y velocidad de respuesta. Nice!"
4,Clear sound for a low cost,"We bought this to use for Skype calls to our families overseas. It handled the cross-world trip in a suitcase well and an earthquake as well.The sound quality is very good and the device is easy to use. No instillation software needed. The mic can be folded up, which makes it useful for storage and for travel.I'm sure there are other way more expensive devices out there that work better, but for the low price, this is a good value. I would recommend this to anyone needing a mic for Skype calls overseas."
4,Decent Mic,"It's a pretty good mic. I have an AC in my room and the mic doesn't do much to suppress it, but it works well for the price paid."
3,Works... kind of.,"After reading some of the reviews I decided to buy this microphone it looked like the perfect solution for me. Yes it is easy to use and it doesn't need any extra software, basically plug and play. However the main and most important feature: ""noise canceling"" DOES NOT WORK!. I'm really disappointed.I don't know if I got a defective product or what, I tried both my macbook and a pc, and the noise background still happens. You can still hear the noise in the background. Notice however using this microphone is better than using the built-in one.Anyway, I will continue looking for a cheap and decent microphone. Wish me luck."
3,"Poor material quality, but decent microphone","Pros: It works, and has a decent microphone.Cons: As I used it, it slowly lost the ability to hold the position your would rotate it too. Eventually, the neck broke entirely."
3,Not Noise-Canceling,"I've read a number of reviews on different sites - and it seems like some people say this mic is great at filtering out background noise, and some people say that it isn't. I can tell you from my experience that this mic will pick up almost any sound in the room. Granted your voice WILL be audible and clear, but you will also be able to hear fans, people talking, mouse clicks, etc. in the background. If you need complete silence then this mic is NOT for you."
4,Good microphone,"I purchased this product mainly to record lectures. So far, it has performed well in a lab setting. The sound is clean, with little inteference from background noise. Not sure how it will do in an actual classroom environment though."
4,Great for the Price,"While not perfect I use this microphone to create screen casts, webinars and podcasts. It does a great job of isolating my voice. My wife is typically watching TV in the background and I have not heard the TV (only her yelling at it...lol).Not sure why anyone would assume a $20 or even most $50 mics would be good for recording a band, singing or use as a DJ. When the time comes I will upgrade to the Audio-Technica AT2020 or a Samson C03U but for my purposes right now this mic does a great job.As for those saying it doesn't work with their OS, I use this on Windows XP, Vista and 7 without installing any additional drivers. I use the built in audio controls for my sound card to adjust settings without any problems."
3,"Decent mic, but low default volume and no mic boost for win 7","I bought this microphone primarily to use for gaming as well as youtube commentaries, and it worked great. The problem occurred when I made the change from windows vista to windows 7. There are no drivers whatsoever for this device, and no microphone boost. If you were buying this to use with a program with built in voice amplifier such as Skype, then it should work just fine. Other than that, you may find that the volume is a bit too low with it's default settings."
4,works well for my needs,i use this as my mic for gaming online. i have the older version that my ex-gf liked so much she has it now. i liked the style on the old one though. it picks ups well. no complaints.
2,Buy A Better Mic!,This product is amazing as soon as you get it but it will break within 1 year. - Keith Clark
4,Produces Great Sound For A Cheap Price,"We bought this microphone as an add-on to our MacBook Pro laptop. It served its purpose of recording book trailers to post on our website. The sound is clear and crisp. You can adjust the loudness easily. If you need to re-record, that's easy, too, and then save your work. I don't think it would meet professional sound-recording standards if you are cutting your own music CD's, DVD's, and MP3's. But it's all you need for simple voice recording. I would advise you to be careful, though. You have to mimick the same sound-recording conditions to get the same quality every time. If you liked the recording and your door was open next to your desk, you'd better keep your door open the next time, too. And don't shuffle papers in the background as you read your script. The microphone is sensitive enough to pick that up, too."
3,Sound reproduction is only accurate at less than an inch of mouth/sound output to microphone,Pros1) Sleek design2) Blowout sound through back to avoid popping sound which works.3) Mute button works well.Cons1) Sound reproduction is only accurate at less than an inch of mouth/sound output to microphone.
5,"Great mic, excellent sound quality, awesome price.","If you want a no frills mic to record youtube videos on or chat VOIP, this is perfect for both. It is directional enough to sound clear, but not so much as to lock you into a single position. The on-off button on the base is very handy as well.Avoid recording a mushy, noisy, hiss filled voice-over, use this mic!"
5,Plug and Play with Vista. Works perfectly with Rosetta Stone,No problems with this microphone. Works as expected. Worth the price of $20.Picks up my voice from 2 feet away. Enough for Rosetta Stone to determine if my pronunciation was accurate.
1,It's not worth it,I think it's not good as you'd think. It picks up a lot of noise. Very poor performance mic. I am using it for Rosetta stone it's been working fine for my rosetta stone but other than that it sucks. You can't really record your voice for commenting for video or anything like that.
1,WARNING: it picks up sound even if it's turned OFF,"I had this microphone for a long time and I loved it.Until I was on Skype and my friend told me to get closer to my microphone, because he can't hear me well. Then I realized that my microphone was not even turned on! Once I turned it on, the volume was of course normal.But this incident showed me that you can't trust this microphone. If you turn it off, the volume will lower, that's all.I confirmed the problem with the Sound Recorder app.It's unbelievable, but true! Please try it yourself and then help to spread the word!"
2,Can't get past the flaws,"It's cheap, all right, but first, it records in only 60 second snippets. What good is that? Totally useless. Then, I can't change the saved files' properties to give them an author or other information than name."
2,Doesn't work with Windows 7,"I was/am looking for a microphone for my laptop and this one received excellent reviews; however, I couldn't get it to work with my computer and I believe that it is because my laptop uses Windows 7 (not Vista or 2000, etc.). The paperwork with this microphone did not mention capatibility with Windows 7 and I wasn't able to get it to work; therefore, I assume that it won't work with Windows 7 operating systems."
1,Another vista vs. mic loss.,"Well, I guess I jumped the gun when ordering this mic, as it does not work at all with my Vista Laptop. I'm sure it works fine when plugged into the proper computer, per the many other positive comments mentioned.I wish that it would be written on the main page that it DOESN'T WORK WITH WINDOWS VISTA!!!! It would have saved me $20."
2,Buy a different mircophone,This works great and is very easy to install. The problem is that it is very delicate and the wand design breaks very readily. The base on the wand broke on the third use after I'd only had it a day or two. It still works but the functionality is limited. This one was more expensive than most and I'm going to have to buy another one.
4,Works great for Skype,"I bought this to use on my PC for Skype. Plug and play, simply insert USB and off you go. Like the boom so I can point to where I am (or others).I can recommend."
2,I am not impressed,I brought this in order to do jobs over the internet so recording quality was very important. The only way this records is if I have the microphone right up to my mouth. If I set it a inch away it will not record.
5,Good service; Quick review,"Lets get straight to the point.Delivery was quick.Packaging benefited what was desired.And the Product has worked perfectly since I got it -- even after a few falls and bangs.Clear. Crisp. Simple.What more do you want?EDIT: 2 YEARS LATER.EDIT: 2 YEARS LATER.2 Years later and I still use this mic.Let me emphasize one thing though. This mic is EXTREMELY sensitive.It can pick up every sound in my room, even if I'm whispering from the opposite wall.You will need to turn it down on your computer.That being said, it's a great mic. I've put it through a tonof use on skype, vent, teamspeak, and mumble.I agree with my original 5 star rating."
2,Need to speak directly into mic,"The product was very easy to set up (just plug it in!) but I was not that impressed with the sound quality. It's maybe ok for doing Skype conversations, but not anything used for professional purposes. I had read that it picks up audio well, but actually you need to speak directly into the mic for it to sound clear and crisp, otherwise you get the gargly, wavy sounds. The price is fair, but overall I was slightly disappointed."
5,Works great for recording conversations,"I use this mic to record my business conversations, and it does exactly that. I can place the mic several feet (5') away from where I am actually conversing, and it consistently picks up my voice and the voice of whomever I am talking to.As long as it is pointed in the general direction of our conversation everything works fine, and the recording is always understandable.In comparison to the previous mics I used in conjunction with my voice activated software, this is the only mic which is usable. And with the handy mute button placed on the unit, I can always quickly mute things when necessary.Otherwise the design of the mic seems solid. The joint the mic is actually mounted on seems strong enough to hold the mic in place (even when mounted vertically). And the base of the unit has some weight which prevents the unit from flying around too easily.For the purposes I use this mic for, I can't recommend it enough, especially when I consider the price."
3,Decent sound with a delicate design.,"I bought six of these for a middle school computer lab. The recording levels are good and keep room noise low. The design is delicate with the boom breaking near the base on two of the mics. I know students can be rough with them, so be careful when adjusting the boom."
2,"Okay quality, Very quiet","The quality was not what I expected out of a $50 microphone, not to mention that even with my mouth practically engulfing the mic, it was still quite quiet. Even though it was very quiet, it was still able to pick up on the soft buzz my computer in the background.I tried normalizing the sound levels in Audacity, but the quality was still below my expectations."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"WARNING THIS MICROPHONE DOES NOT WORK. I have been fighting with it for weeks trying to get my Windows Vista to install it, and after several weeks and several tech support emails and several google searches later it still does not work. WORST PRODUCT EVER. IT SHOULD RECEIVE 0 Stars, however, that is not an option."
4,Logitech USB mic,"I opened the microphone, plugged it in the USB slot, and in about 2 minutes it was working perfectly. You may have to manually go in to programs like skype and tell it the microphone is USB, I had to do that on my computer. It captures your voice really well, I had a fan running in the background and in some tests I did the notice was negligible. You can turn the mic on and off with the button on the stand, it lights up green when on. The only real qualm I have about this mic is that whenever you turn the mic on or off while in a chat, it makes a very audible noise. I was hoping that turning it on or off would be silent but it isn't, that is my only real knock on this fine microphone."
1,Bad Quality For Singing Not Recomended If You Will Use It For Singing,this not good for recording voice you go 1 feet or further it barely picks up voice get 6 inches or closer picks up alot of pops and hisses not recomended if you are a singer or using it for podcasting i recomend the Samson CO1U
1,"Windows 7, 64-bit users: STAY AWAY. STAY FAR AWAY","OKay, well don't believe those who say they've made it work. This thing works when it WANTS TO. I've tried to discover the great mystery behind this piece of hardware that's suppose to be SIMPLE.THERE IS NO GREAT MYSTERY. This thing just works when it wants to, AND doesn't when it doesn't want to. I swear to you that this is the truth. I've tried every possible solution that the peeps in here suggested. NOTHING WORKED. Zero. Nada. Zinch.DO yourself a favor and buy a different mic. The economy is performing too terrible for me to try to solve the great mystery behind Logitech's mic. Eff that.Peace."
3,"great microphone, but HORRIBLE CLAMSHELL PACKAGING","Others have reviewed the microphone, and done a better job then I could. Yes, it's not a Sennheiser, but for the price, it does a great job.My complaint is about the packaging. You know those frustrating plastic clamshell packages that you need a plasma torch to cut through? This item is packaged in a frickin' DOUBLE CLAMSHELL. There are TWO distinct thick plastic layers to hack through.I almost sent it back after the first one.Manufacturers should be held to account for this.Apparently there's a special Amazon frustration-free-packaging version of this product. I recommend that you investigate it.Grrrrrr!"
1,Broken on Arrival,This thing was broken when it came out of the box. Loose connection so far as I can tell. Wires had not been soldered! Worthless piece of junk.
3,"You May Like it, but Your Vista May Not","It's a decent microphone. I thought that getting a USP-microphone would be a better choice than the standard audio jack variety; but as is true with so many things that seem simple enough, trying to get it to work with Vista is an unnecessary difficulty. Installation for Vista is absent from the simple instructions in the booklet, leading me to believe that this microphone pre-dates it. Nonetheless, I forced my computer to accept the device by deactivating its own, inferior, built-in microphone. It works now; but I use it primarily with language-learning software so I have very little comment on the quality of its recordings. For the purpose of the language software, it is a great improvement over the built-in microphone."
3,Okay Purchase,"This Mic was an okay, it picked up no surrounding sound and was very clear. The one thing is that it was very quiet when I played it back, so I always head to talk very loudly into it. There are better mics out there for a better price."
4,A winner,"We bought two of these microphones mostly to use with Skype. They were very easy to set up, the computers recognized them and they were working immediately. We have had no problems. Occasionally the person at the other end of the phone would complain of a strong echo but I am not sure if this due to Skype or the microphone picking up sounds from the computer speakers."
5,Great Microphone For The Price,I have used a few different microphones of different types from desktop mics to headset mics and this one sounded the best for the price range I really think this is a great microphone its great for skype and other voip services but this is NOT meant for recording voice or instruments it would not be acceptable for such a task but it was not meant for that anyway. If you want something that sounds a lot better then this then the Blue Snowball mic would probably suit you better.
5,Great Product,"Exactly what I needed and at a great price. Installed very easy...just plugged it into a USB port and that was it. Have had no problems whatsoever and we have had it about a month. We only use it for Skype, but it is definitely worth the price."
4,Review of Logitech microphone,This item was recommended by a coworker. Works well for novice screencasters. Will let others borrow it in our group.
5,Great product,"I needed a microphone to complement my built-in monitor webcam so that I could use video chat on my home computer. I received this product quickly, set it up in less than a minute, turned it on and was ready to video chat. I have used it for 3 chats already and the people on the other end had no complaints about my voice clarity. This product completely satisfied my needs."
5,Works like a charm,This mic works great. It's stylish yet unobstrusive. It takes up little desk space. I plugged it in and it came up on the list of mic inputs on the computer. Just select the mic as your choice and you're up and running. I'm using it for SKYPE.
2,Not for recording meetings,I bought this to experiment with recording meetings using my laptop. This microphone didn't seem any better than the built in laptop mic.
2,Doesn't work at all for gaming,"I wanted a microphone for use with gaming while using speakers instead of a headset/mic combo because I don't like the feel of headsets. I picked up two of these microphones due to favorable reviews but the mic just doesn't work very well for gaming. My voice doesn't get picked up unless I have the microphone practically in my mouth, and my voice comes out choppy (with a few seconds of silent time stutter) and it's overly loud with a large amount of air/puffiness noise. I've been adjusting and readjusting this mic (moving it away from speakers, trying it with earphones so no feedback, varying push to talk vs. manual on/off, etc) as well as adjusting my voice software for over a year now and just had to go back to headsets because this mic is so crappy and I can't speak for longer than 5 seconds at a time without transmit problems. A $25 Logitech headset that plugs directly into my soundcard worked fabulously.No more USB mics for me"
2,No Windows 7 drivers,This item is useless on Windows 7. There are no drivers now. Have not yet tried it yet on a XP. Current Computer did not even recognize this.
4,Nice USB microphone for the price,"I ordered these microphones to use with a children's computer camp using Scratch (scratch.mit.edu) so that the children could record their voices for use in their animated stories.They worked really well. These microphones aren't (and don't claim to be) broadcast quality microphones, but very nice for the price and did exactly what we wanted."
5,It's noiseless!,"My gosh! This was amazing! I moved from having a crappy laptop built-in microphone to this! There is a clear difference! You can hear yourself the way you hear yourself with your own ears! Unlike a built-in which makes you sound either deeper and gross.The quality is amazing! If you record yourself in a room, a nice quite room, there will be no noise. I recorded myself and I was amazed!If you record your self in a room with a fan on, you can hear the fan as noise, but you'll still hear yourself! (tested!)People talking outside my door, I shut the door, and it sounded like those people weren't there in the first place.I completely recommend this item to people who are exchanging from older microphones. Not sure if it's something you would use professionally, but this product is more than what it cost right now!"
5,great mic for skype,"this is a great little mic. it was very easy to install- plug and play no cd or download required. the usb cord is pretty long which can be good or bad depending on ur situation. i didnt need a cord this long so i just rolled it up and stuck a rubber band on it.the clarity is great from what ive seen. i use the mic for skype and havnt had any problem. the only drawback is that if its anywhere near the speakers itl pick the sound up and make a realy annoying echo. another small flaw is that itl pick up the sound of my overhead fan and make a whistling noise, which my skype friends dont like too much. both of these problems are easily managable ( move the mic and turn off the fan lol)other than that no prroblems. its not too big not too little. great product overall."
2,Do not buy if you have a cheapo sound card,"I have a standard issue Dell desktop, with the default AMD sound. Nothing fancy, but 3.5mm analog headset mics have always worked great for me. This mic, however, cannot produce an acceptable level of volume. I tried multiple applications, but I always sounded like I was talking from the other side of the room.And here's why you shouldn't buy this if you have a cheap sound card: I could not change the settings enough to compensate. I set my mic level to 100 (max), but because I have a cheap sound card, there was no ""microphone boost"" option like I've always seen for the analog mics.This mic possibly works great if your sound card can support it. Me, I went withCyber AcousticsStereo Headset/Microphone, Ambidextrous design AC-201because it's analog, and it sounds just fine."
5,Logitech Slender Microphone,"We are very pleased with the performance, quality and good look of our new Logitech USB Desktop Microphone. I like that it can fold down to be out of the way, when not in use or to keep from interfering with the viewing area. And, of course, Amazon delivered on time and in packaging adequately protecting the product from any damage. We know that we can count on Logitech for quality products."
5,Best entry line microphone,They work very well. It's plug-n-play.I use them under Windows 7 64-bits and Teamspeak.I love the minimalism packaging.
5,Great product,"I want to thank ""Mark Twin Chen"" who noted his helpful comment below. I bought this at the store and at first I was frustrated because I coulf barely hear the sound when played back on my voice recorder on my laptop. Then I remembered reading what Mark said in his comments about going to ""Start/control panel/ sounds & audio devices,manage audio devices"". then clcik the recording tab. You'll see two microphone images. Select the one that says ""USB audio device. Double clcik to open. Adjust volume way up to ""86"". Select ""OK"". Afterwards,the microphone recorded my voice loud and beautiful. On playback, there was no need to maximize the volume on my laptop. Also, the instructions hint at the same thing. Thanks a million! This is a good buy, especially for the person who wants to create a pod cast but does bot want an expensive microphone. Well worth the money."
4,Very good mic for the money.,"This microphone has lasted me about 2-3 years, and it is very, very good.PROS+Sound quality is excellent+Good price+The light flashes green when its on, or when its not it doesnt flash. Can easily be turned off/on by pushing the button.+Its adjustableCONS-If it falls, it breaks fast. More my fault, but just saying.-Background noise cancellation isnt the best, It picked me up talking in the kitchen.Overall a very good mic, Im replacing mine now because it broke but it did the job."
3,good value,"I found the microphone functions with good fidelity and no noise, but I had to speak closer to it than I had anticipated. I plugged the USB cord directly into my Mac Mini and it works fine. I like to use the free audio recording & editing program ""Audacity"" with it."
4,"Perfect, as long as you do something first","Like many others, when I first used this microphone, I noticed everything I recorded was barely audible. Then I realized I could change the input level of the microphone under the sound setting in the control panel. Once I did that, I found the microphone to work very well. It will be more than enough for my simple youtube aspirations."
3,"Basic mic, works fine with some disclaimers","Overall, this is a good basic USB mic. Pretty much just plug it in and go. The only downside I've had is that I've needed to boost the mic volume all the way and keep the mic much closer to me than I expected for it to pick up my voice at a decent volume for Ventrilo. I don't speak very loudly to begin with and my voice is a bit on the low end of the frequency range, so this mic isn't the most ideal for me. A headset, where the mic is closer to my mouth works much better in my case.On the up side, the mic does filter out a lot of noise, like fans from your computer, etc. So it produces a clean sound."
4,Easy to set up and use,Plug it in and it works! This has to be the easiest microphone to use I have ever seen. The lighted on - off switch is placed on the base and is easy to see and use. I prefer the voice activated settings instead of using a hot key or the switch on the microphone to talk. Because it sits on the desktop it can pickup vibrations from the equipment when its in the always on mode. I put a simple soft pad under it and the noise stopped. I would recommend this product to anyone needing a PC microphone.
5,THIS ALBUM IS HOT,THIS ALBUM IS HOT I LOVE IT ITS AMAZING WORK OF ART SONG AFTER SONG IAM AMAZED AND RECOMMEND FOR YOU TO BUY IT !!! FINALLY SOME GOOD MUSIC
3,"Mostly good device, but not as advertised","The website said that the brush could be kept in the mouthpiece to protect the end of it, as in the picture, but it was to long for the rubber to protect the end of my mouthpiece. I tried to force it in, but the metal bent. I still use the brush though, although it is not enough to get the buildup out of my neglected mouthpiece. You get what you pay for."
1,Awful,"It is hard to take this book seriously, as you plow through the author's pathetic 'poetry'. What is even harder to take is the ridiculous personal, dissident spin the author puts on each sacrament. This is certainly not Catholic teaching, but rather the opinions of what one person wants the sacraments to be...put down in a silly poetic structure.Of course, the title itself is a huge red flag for anyone who believes what the Church actually teaches (I found this on the bookshelf of a dissident parish and checked to see if it was as bad as the title makes it sound -- its worse)"
3,Nice shoes for ocasional walking...,"I buy a pair of this shoes to my wife for ocasional walking, like other reeboks for walking are very soft and comfortable, but not long-lasting, have it on mind."
5,Beautiful centerpiece for modern home,"The is a beautifully crafted bowl, very nice stainless steel. It has a good, heavy feel to it, and in person it has a great luster."
4,low voltage lights,"As promised, on time and work(so far) as promised. Not too hot, bright enough but not blinding!"
3,an unusual love story,Ellen Burstyn is a talented actress and does not disappoint in this film...but Walter Matthau is less than ideal. Overall a sweet love story...
3,"different, but usable","I couldn't find the Elmer's wood putty I'd had before. This has a different texture, but I can use it. Just takes a little getting-used-to. Basically, Elmer's is good for patching sheetrock and even oversized holes drilled in tile, as well as wood. They could call it Spack-All if they wanted to. It'll hold a screw in any material."
4,Great product -horrible package,"I really like this product. Sands smooth and takes stain like wood. Easy to work with and dries very hard. I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the horrible package. Lid keeps popping open no matter how careful I close it. So, putty dries out fast. Had to transfer to a Tupperware container. You would think a company as ,good as Elmer's would have designed a better container .... or ..... Is it on purpose to get more sales? I hope not."
4,Dries unlike most wood fillers.,"Plastic wood has a short working time, will dry quickly, and is hard to sand off. Wood filler usually remains soft and is added after finishing but this product is pleasantly different. This wood filler has a long working time, will dry slowly, is easy to sand, and is added before finishing (takes the finish). I like this stuff. I'd like it better if the first container had arrived closed. The top has popped off - Amazon sent a new one overnight. I hope Amazon maintains their great service forever."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I just finished reading The Purple Cloud and decided to see what others had written about it. What did I miss, if anything, in my reading.I missed nothing. What little merit the book brings (the discussion of two opposing forces - white and black - in the universe) is so buried in pointless, overdrawn, repetitive, monotonous, utterly boring writing that I am amazed that this remains in print much less on any serious horror or SF reader's ""must read"" list.I cannot recommend reading The Purple Cloud for anyone unless they have a VERY good reason to slog through the pages. A reason like a PhD thesis or maybe a bet. It would have to be a serious bet before I would waste my reading time with it again.I think H.P. Lovecraft was being nice when he wrote The Purple Cloud as ""falling little short of actual majesty"" and ""a distinct letdown"".It must have been the little mention and use of poet Machen in the book which made Lovecraft be so kind."
1,Une Barque (NOT Baroque),".... A tacky photo-copy of the original, not newly edited nor anything else. You can get the entire Miroirs(not MIRROIRS as in this dreadful presentation) as well as ""Gaspard"" and others in the DOVER Masterpieces of RAVEL for $...Special Order. ... In no case should you ever buy this.This is the worst ..."
4,The Jamestown Adventure,"It is interesting to read the actual events of the time. It is a great History lesson for anyone. If you like history, it is a must read."
2,Not all that it could be,"I was disappointed with this system once getting it home.Pros: Nice looking system, speaker phone and mute buttons on each handset, volume buttons on the side of the phone versus the face, ability to select different wallpapers and ringers for each handset, and of course the expandability.Cons: Conversations kept cutting out, the resolution of the color LCD was not as high as I had expected, unable to name each handset, and limited ring tones and wallpapers.Overall, this system wasn't all that it could be for the price I paid and will be returning it today. I am now looking at purchasing the Uniden CLX485 and hope that it will better suit my... wants."
5,TINY BOOK PACKED WITH DELIGHT!,"I thought this book was wonderful. Although I have read many holiday books and wasn't expecting anything new, I was pleased to find lots of surprises. The book has a Christian theme and would make a great gift for someone special, along with a hot beverage and a comfy chair."
4,"Spare, tense, and dark","This might be Vega's most minimal, impressionistic album to date. Washes of sound, electronic loops and drum machines, make the songs sound sketchy and unfinished but the effect is cumulative. Vega's repetitive phrases -- ""Sneaker Gun Fire,"" ""Bad Scene,"" ""Jab Gee"" -- become descriptions of things imagined in the dark, or heard down an alley. The album's also filled with Vega's usual concerns: ""Wacko Warrior"" is an extended set-piece in a mode that stretches all the way back to ""Frankie Teardop"" on the first Suicide LP. Not a very accessible album (""Saturn Strip"" and ""Just a Million Dreams"" are Alan's most pop-oriented efforts) but an effective one."
5,"Unique read, not to be repeated","I loved the book and am mystified that more of the participants didn't also write their experiences. I have sent two copies to other carnuts like me. Jealous of the adventure, and even as a ""senior"" would love to do same. I am greatly saddened by the authors passing and makes me appreciate her writtings, wish she had written more of her experiences in other ""road trips""."
4,Down in the Valley,"""Golden State"" takes a fast, furious glide through 30 years in the life of Andrew Kelbow, a bright but unfocused guy from a broken L.A. home. The novel really glides along, and the prose is precise and clever. You get a real sense of what it was like to grow up in L.A. But this is light fare, lighter certainly than the duck recipe that does one character in. These lives don't have great meaning; like the city they inhabit, they're mainly surface. But for debut fiction, it's assured and clever. I enjoyed spending time with these people, particularly Fanny, the matriarch who seems to surf through her life. BTW, I was amused by the first page, in which I find out Andrew was born a mere five days after I was."
5,A Truly Mighty Mouse,"I cannot lay enough accolades on this product. Its truly portable, insert two ULTRA-LIFE 9-volt batteries and this thing will work everytime without the hassle of a wall wort for well over six months of hard use. The signal is very clean for what it does. With a gain control for each channel there's no need to be a sound engineer to make adjustments during a gig, just reach over and adjust. It's size is wonderful, fits anywhere. I've owned this product for several years and it has never failed me, I'm sold on ART products."
5,Thin and Lightly lubricated,These condoms are thin and lightly lubricated. They have a tiny latex smell but not enough to turn me off. First time condom user and highly enjoyed.
5,yup,these work and the that's what I wanted to do haven't had kids send recommend beast anybody jewelers latexlol lol
3,Mon's review,"We bought this for our 8 year old son last Christmas. It was fun to build, but not a toy to play with. It falls apart easily and is not easy to put back together. Some of the parts attach to parts inside, and if they come apart, you would need to take it apart to put it back together, very frustrating for such an expensive toy. Okay for collectors though."
2,"Nice looking toy, but difficult to play with.","My son wanted this for a long time, and he finally got it for Christmas. Once it was assembled, the frustration began. The construction is not very sturdy and my son had to keep putting wheels or panels back on. Other Lego sets have been much more durable. This set appears to be made for display, and not for play."
5,Still Available - Desa Specialty Staples,Happy to find these - Our local Ace Hardware said they could no longer order these staples so I was VERY happy I could still find them for our Desa Powerfast cable stapler 31000. These come in super handy to hold a print in a new (used) frame without the expense of a frame shop. Seller shipped in a very timely fashion. THANKS!
4,Note: This is a mini-TOSLINK plug,"This didn't work out for me. When I bought it, I only looked at the main description (""Toslink Digital Optical Right Angle Audio Adapter""), and although the picture looked a little funny, I figured it might fit my receiver anyway. It turns out that this is a TOSLINK-to-mini-TOSLINK adapter -- the male part fits a mini optical jack and won't work with a standard TOSLINK optical port.It was my fault; the detailed description actually does contain the word ""mini"", I just glossed over it because I didn't know such a thing existed at the time. For pictures and descriptions of the two types of plugs, see this link: [...].The seller was great and refunded my money, including shipping. I'm rating it 4 stars because it probably works fine, I just bought the wrong part."
3,"I thought is was pretty good, but!","This is pretty good CD and worth the price. As far as musicians on it, Tom picked a great bunch of LA guys to perform on a few songs. I am not one for drum machines and a lot of keyboards, but the tracks with real musicians kick and Tom sure can play that Sax. I have seen Tom play around in San Diego a few times over the past year and he is a good player, If you get a chance go seem him and you'll get a better vibe from his live playing then that on the CD. If you are into new artists I would think about getting this CD. If you want it for the fact that he has some of LA's top musicians on it, then get it now! Can't wait for the next CD, I wonder if it will have some life that this one is missing."

4,Rabitos truffles,"The chocolates are great! I've become addicted to them. The only problem I have experienced with the last two shipments was that the cooling pack was not sufficient to keep them cool enough, so they arrrived half melted. Even though the taste was not changed, the appearance was less inviting and they were stuck to the packaging.I will probably not order any until the weather gets cooler."
5,"Oh man, these things are so good.","I got these for my mom last Mother's Day and they were amazingly tasty. If you like figs even a little bit you will love these things.Truly there is nothing I could compare the taste to becuase the flavor is so unique.They are expensive, but seeing as how you can't get anything else like this anywhere and they are so delicious, they are worth every penny."
4,"The movie wasnt great, but...","The actors were some of the best wrestlers the world has ever seen, you have to be a true fan to understand this movie...and its a true story!"
2,One More Shot That Missed,"The wrestlers in One More Shot are truly great. As wrestlers, but as actors, they leave a lot to be desired. Danny Hodeges dialogue is strained and he sounds as if he is reading from cue cards. The scenes that are supposed to be the Olympic trials which pass for a climax are totally unrealistic. They were obviously filmed in a tiny high school gym with only a few extras to represent the crowd. The story could be a good one but the film is a near disaster. If you want to see a wrestling movie check out Vision Quest, the slightly comedic Takedown or even Disney's Spooner. As a member of a wrestling family and a wrestling coach, I bought this video with high expectations but was greatly dissapointed. Your money would be much better spent on attending a local high school match and a couple of hot dogs. The hot dogs will bear a marked resemblence to the acting in the film and the action on the mats will be much better."
1,Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen.,"Really, who wrestles a bear anyway. Especially after running through the park and pounding a beer. Why did Buccaroo not talk for so long, then his first words were, ""I never coached before."" What the hell was that? Then at the end the main character loses to John Smith after it was his lifelong goal."
2,"Bad Hard Drive, Bad Service","I purchased the PCGTR3A in May of 2004. Less than 3 months later, my hard drive died -- Sony replaced. Now, November 2005, my hard drive died again. This time it was not covered, and all of the estimates to replace are $260+. My sister has the exact same model, and her hard drive also died after less than 1 1/2 years.Also, Sony's support is useless. It is very difficult to get a person on the phone without paying a tech support service fee. When I finally got them on the phone, they suggested I buy a better hard drive next time. Are they admitting that this one is not good?!?Although the laptop is light and sleek, these physical characteristics are overshadowed by its unreliable hard drive and Sony's unhelpful customer service."
1,sony vaio pcg-tr3a laptop with bad LCD Screen and bad keyboard,User lie about item... the laptop was drop very hard because it was crack. I received the item on time. I really love the itembut lcd screen is going bad and keyboard is bad.
1,Failed in a week; customer support is dire,Caveat emptor. A beautiful piece of design and technology but is it reliable? Mine broke within a week of purchase. The customer support is useless.
1,Poor customer service,"Never trust Sony laptops, you lose functionality if you ever make the mistake of upgrading and the laptop is pretty much useless."
3,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly","The Good: it's *very* sexy, light, compact and fast.The Bad: Month 4 of use -- hard drive dies but Sony replaces.Month 11 of use -- no power -- totally dead. Sony fixes.The Ugly: at month 12, my warranty is expired; the system runs hot ALL THE TIME. It's a simple matter of time before something blows again.Net-Net: Owning this laptop is like owning a Lambo -- you don't know if it's going to start when you turn the key -- but when it's working -- you're the coolest kid in town. Better have a regular computer; keep this as your 'toy'."
1,Looks 10 reliability 0,"I have had this expensive machine for a little over two years and have not gone six months without major problems. This includes two trips to the service center in San Diego. I love the size, its features and it's eye catching looks. However it's lack of an internal fan leads to overheating which I am sure is contributing to the poor performance--including the need to replace the hard drive after less than 6 months of light home use by my wife. I noticed that Sony produced an early micro similar for the Japenese market which was pulled due to over heating problems and have wondered if the TR3A is a relative. I have anorther VAIO desktop that runs Media Center XP and it is outstanding. I also believe Sony's technical support is one of the best---I just wish I wasn't on a first name basis with them. I would strongly recommend against anyone purchasing this machine."
5,I love it more than my girl friend !!!!,"Simply speaking.. this is the most coolest and sexiest thing I have ever had.. And it really make me feel good about my decision of buying tr3a when people just can't stop eyeing this babe..PROS: Small size, Light weight, Best features including bright display, inbuilt cd-dvd drive, inbuilt webcam and mic, all possible slots including usb, flash card reader, magicdrive, wi-fi ready, better battery life. Keyboard is awesome, noiseless and soft like anything.CONS: Gets hot (You have to handle it so that base gets exposed to a little air), Screen gets tinted with finger marks if touched (my friend has a compaq and he wipes it with bare fingers w/o problem), Screen is brighter when you are viewing right from front, not from side (unlike powerbook), speakers are really crappy and irritating. On top of all, its pricey.I don't anymore need a girl friend now..:-)"
2,Sreen is a big problem,"I loved the whole idea of this light weight notebook and camera,but the screen is so vulnerable to even a slight touch that it is an anxiety producing nightmare. I accidentally touched the corner of the screen while adjusting the cover. My thumb print cost $724.00 to fix and Sony seems not to care. I have had the machine 2 months. There is no warning label on or around the screen and the margin of error is small. Unless you have money to spare I would not buy this computer. I am now afraid to use it. Sony is aware of the problem but is not supporting the consumer. Caveat Emptor!"
3,Battery didn't last that long as claimed,"Like everyone else. I read the reviews, user's comments, checkout the stats, etc. about this laptop. Then finally put out the big $$$ to get it. There are alot of things to like about this computer like other owners have described. My only complain is about the battery. Sony's site and most folks in this column said that they can get 6 hours with a fully charge with the battery that comes with this laptop. But I only get about 3 - 3.5 hours max including using the ""Maximum Battery Life"" profile. I have put up some more $$$ to get the larger battery, still what I got is about 7 hrs or less. So where is the 8+ hours that other people have said ? I have been looking up and down in Sony's technical support site and Goolge but find nothing said if this long lasting battery claim is true. Does anyone have an actually experience with this battery claim ?"
5,A BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE!,"Yasujiro Ozu's ""Early Summer"" is a fine film full of passionate performances and emotional storytelling about one family, and how one decision changes their lives forever. The beautiful Setsuko Hara gives a fine performance as Noriko. Her performance is breathtaking, and she is given a strong supporting cast to work with. The film's dazzling cinematography captures both the striking interiors and the dazzling beauty of the Japanese landscape. While it isn't the greatest film experience of all time, it is a beautifully realized motion picture that every person should view at least once. Movie/DVD Grade: A-"
5,Functional fashion,Why can't your dog be fashionable with this stunning collar? Beautifully made of quality materials and the colors are so vibrant. Brightens my day just looking at it.
4,arrived damaged,"Like other reviewers, mine arrived damaged due to inadequate packaging. The Sportsman's Guide took care of it, though and their price can't be beat. The bench is very stable and well-made, but buy locally if you need it fast."
4,"Trashed in delivery, you bet!","Look at the review by L. Smith, and you will know how my box looked. Fortunately, the damage is minor with a scratch completely across both the table top and the seat, and chips of paint missing. I tell you, I believe this item had been returned a couple of times and still sold as new by Amazon LLC. My box was open and obviously had been re-taped several times, but it was open all the way around when I found it on my drive way (carport). Just as Amazon hoped, I will keep it anyway, but beware.."
4,A great sociological book,This is a great sociological book. It looks at current issues in a sociological perspective. I found it to be informative and enjoyable as sociology student. However this book would be great for the general public. I have only read some of the articles but I found it to be very balanced by providing the pros and cons of every argument. The only reason I don't give this book five stars is because I haven't read all the articles yet. A sure buy.
5,Experiencing God through Christy!,"I cannot tell you how much the Christy Miller series has made me get closer to God!! This is a great book and I recommend the whole series. Robin created some really Godly people that are an encouragement to me. Youth ministers, give it to your girls! Mothers, give it to your daughters! This is a must read for all teenage girls!!"
5,I loved these books,"Christy miller goes on a trip to europe with her bestfriends.Her 2 best friends get in a fight, She has some troubles withher boyfriend doug, and Christy figures out her heart is still in love with Todd!She tried 2 forget him in the beginning of the book.her missions trip has WAY more adventures than she would ever have thought. LAST CHAPTER IS SOOOOOOOO ROMANTIC!"
1,SUCKS,This piece of garbage doesnt work. Was very dis-satisfied with the performance. Completely disappointed. Will NOT buy from them again.
5,Does Not Work on the Smaller Snes units,"This is a really cool device to gain an advantage for a bunch of old but awesome snes games. Unfortunately Nintendo put a lockout chip in the last version of the Snes they released ( the smaller one with a push button reset switch )( It works on just about all of the older units with two large purple slider barswitches )[web page] has a bunch of codes for just about any game you can think of, it also loads quick and has very little advertising.Enjoy beating the **** out of all the games that used to be soo tough. There's even a code to beat all the Bosses in Chrono Trigger with one hit!!"
1,Reminds me of a cleaning product,"I LOVE White Moss by Acca Kappa, and foolishly assumed that Calycanthus would have the same very fresh scent. To me, however, Calycanthus is reminiscent of a cleaning product used perhaps in bathrooms. The scent is not cloyingly sweet, but has the type of overtone that catches in your throat, threatening to make you cough. I feel asthmatic when inhaling Calycanthus. As you might guess from this review, I definitely wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. The quality is that of any of the colognes that you might find in the drug store. It certainly isn't worth the $59 price. Very ordinary scent!Acca Kappa Calycanthus Eau De Toilette From Italy"
5,This one is by far the best....,"I already own one Cuisipro, which I have had for several years. I came on-line to order a second one after making the decision to toss the OXO Good Grips wire cheese slicer, purchased at about the same time, that we had in our trailer. While the Cuisipro wire has remained tight for years, the OXO Good Grips wire cheese slicer has really never been acceptable, since the wire is so loose. We have attempted to tighten the wire to no avail! The Cuisipro costs twice as much, but it is worth every penny!"
2,Cuisipro Cheese Slicer,"This product has a very durable handle...but...the wire ends that are supposed to secure into the head, came loose and failed to hold the wire taut after only the second time. Perhaps the plastic ends shrunk in the dishwasher but it said dishwasher safe. It simply failed on the second usage! That's an expensive cheese slicer! I would NOT recommend!"
1,Wire broke on first slice?,"Everyone else gave this great ratings, but mine literally broke the first time I used it. I'm going to try and get a replacement wire from the company.UPDATE: They quickly sent me a replacement wire. I've had no problems since."
1,Heavy duty?,I bought this cracked the back within 5 minutes next day got into my car for work and it hooked on something broke in 3 pieces save your money.
1,"slow navi, bogus Live Traffic","I wrote a very good review for this device 2 weeks after I used it. Now I regreted like hell. This device is too slow in finding satellite (like 2 mins sometimes). Also, the device will tell you the address you entered is to a unreachable destination when I entered to go back my home!! The deadliest, the whole purpose that i bought this one was due to the Live Traffic Update service, after 3 mo of trial period, you will find out that the company don't have contract with TMC (live traffic provider) to let you subscribe. it's B8ll Sh8t."
1,"Useless incorrect maps, TMC non functional","The map for Dallas TX has huge errors, like not knowing the correct addresses or cross streets for Central Expressway, the oldest, and most central highway through the middle of town.The TMC does not tell you anything about traffic or construction.Neither of the service desks are interested in helping at all- they say they regret that the info is not accurate."
1,nostalgic 4 pong,Not all the games worked. I was especially disappointed that Pong didn't work properly.
1,Not what we expected at all,"My husband and I ordered this game thinking it would have the games we grew up with on it. I should have done some research before ordering because it didn't have a single game we expected. We both had the Atari when we were kids and enjoyed games such as Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Mario Brothers and many more, but not one of these games or others from that time frame were included. Just be sure to see a list of included games before you order so you're not disappointed. We returned ours because we were totally unhappy with it."
1,Don't waster your money,"What a waste of time and money. The graphics are terrible, the joy sticks don't work and this was just an overall disappointemnt. I was really looking forward to playing the OLD atari games, but I guess you get what you pay for. Really, don't waste your money on this!!!"
3,Some good games. Some duds.,"Some great classic games on here. Unfortunately some of them (Caverns of Mars) are glitchy and almost unplayable. For casual players, this is a better option than buying a used Atari and searching for games."
2,Mini Atari does Not compare to actual Atari,"Product is very cheap, hard to navigate between games.Looks like an Atari, does not play like a real Atari.Only good thing is you get a bunch of games to choose from without switch cartridge."
3,Not bad,"First off, this console is vastly superior to the Atari Flashback 1 console. The FB1 was actually a NES on a chip, with emulated games. You can tell it's not 100% the real deal when you warp somewhere on Solaris.The FB2 however, is the real deal. You can even hack it with some work to use Atari 2600 cartridges. The joysticks are authentic(not 100%) and are about as comfy as the originals. The game selection is decent. My favorite is the easter egg that allows you to play a few paddle games. Up for 4 player Warlords? This has it.The only downside is you can't tell what difficulty level you are at with the switches, a few games are buggy on newer TVs, and they could have put so much more on it. The revised Flashback 2 has a few different games, but not worth persuing.It makes a great conversation piece on your entertainment system either way."
2,Some Games Simply Don't Function,"I'm a bit confused by the reviews with 4+ stars. Many of the games are not playable as key elements do not appear on screen. Most notably for me, some missiles in Missile Command destroy your cities site unseen and in both versions of Asteroids, your ship does not appear (try dodging an asteroid if you don't know where you are or where you are pointed). I'm not sure what QA was done before shipping, but the version of Flashback 2 with Pitfall appears to be a hit or miss, frustrating affair. Might this be an issue with television technology? For example, does a flat panel TV only exhibit these issues? For me that is still a QA issue that should have been resolved before shipping a product."
2,No Pac Man??,"Ok first of all I will say that to me I don't think this is very much worth owning... too many classics are missing to make it worth your while. Maybe it was a liscensing problem who kmows... But quintessential Atari games are not present. There is no Pac Man, Mrs. Pac Man, Chopper Command, Berzerk, Donkey Kong, Enduro, Grand Prix, Breakout, Phoenix, Pole Position, oh the list can go on. I will stick to my original 6 switcher and hope it never dies on me. The games on this unit are mildy amusing but like I said, you will keep scrolling down the list searching for the classics and they just aren't here in my opinion!"
4,"ITS LIKE PAC-MAN FEVER, without the PAC-MAN!","a GREAT way to relive the 80's without all that hairgel. The scaled-down look of the ATARI 2600, the godfather of the home play systems, is reproduced without all the dusty cartridges. The Flashback includes 40 classic Atari games (and others from Activision) with gameplay on the original joystick design and the original game variations and difficulty settings. Games like Battle zone, Combat, Outlaw, Adventure, Pitfall, River raid, Lunar lander, Missile command, Yar's Revenge and Return. I was pleased with the Flashback on most points,having lost my original 2600 in Katrina, but was disappointed by the absence of a few favorites of mine like: Night Driver and Warlords. I also would have liked a paddle variation for the set. Speaking of paddles, Flashback II. included Pong, but ours didn't work right.Warning: Do not to confuse this system with Atari FlashBack (no Roman numeral) which has the 2nd gen. controlers and less games (it retails for under $20.)"
3,older graphics but still fun,this is not as up to date as the rest but still fun great for the price
4,Great throw back!,I bought this for my husband who is a huge gamer and wanted an original system. he played it as soon as he could Christmas morning. Our only real complaint is where is Frogger and Pole Position?! But over all great fun and I got a great price on it before Christmas. It shipped directly from amazon in great time and was excellent quality. Would definitely order from them again!
5,Very Nice,"Atari was part of my life as a child. This version includes the Activision's megahits Pitfall and River Raid is far the best sold. Vendel really made a good job on it. The joysticks are hard, just like the original ones.Unfortunatelly, this version is not produced any longer, the Activision's games were deleted. The new version, Atari Flashback 2+, has a section called Sports, which is nice too. But I do prefer River Raid and Pitfall.Another thing is there's no cartridge port, so to play any other game some solder points have to be activated.But, for those who love videogames and for those who want to remember the old times in front of the TV set, is an excellent choice."
3,"Just like the old days, but no pac man?","I think the game is pretty true to the original, its amazing how much we take for granted these days looking back on these old games. I only have the complaint that some of the most popular titles are sorely missing. For a unit such as this they could have easily added a few more to make this a truly nostalgic experience. Maybe they were wasted on the original flashback unit? I have no idea..."
3,Not like the original,"This Atari is smaller than the original and is very convenient to store and hook up. The games are all programmed in which saves the hassle of changing game cartridges. The games themselves don't seem to be the quality of the original, and several will not load. Maybe it's because I'm older now but they don't seem as fun as they used to. It's certainly worth the money, especially if you have little kids to share them with."
3,Very few clasics,"Very few clasics, I love dodge em, pitfall, asteroids and missile command, may be yars revenge but thas all, lots of good games missing, no pac man, invaders, bomber, uow I remember playing a lot of good games that is really a surprise that so few reach this console, its a shame."
2,Atari Flashback,"Not so great....quite a few games didn't work. Nice to see the ""old school"" games again, but most of them were hard to figure out. Pong didn't work for us, which ,in my opinion, there is no excuse for.Had I bought it at a brick and mortar store, I would've returned it. Daughter took it to college with her anyway.Happy that it cost so little, but now I see why."
1,disappointed,The console did not work. I could not get an image on the TV. I read that this is a common problem with newer TVs but mine is over 10 years old. I sent it back for a refund.
1,Fun idea that didn't turn out so great.,"I got this as a Christmas present for a friend. He was really excited about it, so as soon as it was out of the box we plugged it in to play. The graphics wouldn't work at all on the TV screen, they were constantly lopsided and flickering. Sometimes when we tried to get the console to work, the graphics would be only halfway visible, leaving half of the screen blank. The buttons on the console itself would stick and weren't functional at all. Only one of the controllers worked, which wasn't useful in itself considering the state of the graphics. I wasn't expecting anything flashy, just fun and the Atari Flashback 2 ended up being a pretty big disappointment."
2,Could not find favs,"Advertised my favorite game and although I went through all the games I can't find it, i believe the name is Snake Pit. Did not come with directions and I can't figure out how to end a game without resetting. More difficult to operate than the original."
2,Activision where?,"Another reviewer said ""River Raid"" and ""Pitfall"" are in this system, but I can't find them on the game, or listed in the manual. I'm quite disappointed."
3,Fun at first,"I was really excited to get the chance to play many of the old Atari games having enjoyed my Atari as a teenager. I especially enjoyed playing Adventure which was a favorite game of mine many years ago. I also liked the variety of games on the machine and the small, compact size of the game console. However, the lack of instructions for the games (without having to download from the Internet) and the short connection cable were frustrating. You cannot be very far from the tv to play. Also the fact that you have to turn the console off to switch games is rather frustrating. Despite this I enjoyed playing the games off and on for about two weeks of relatively light playing until one of the joysticks broke in half in my hands. I hope the other joystick will last longer than the first."
2,Was Disappointed!!!,"I had this bookmarked to buy and my brother suprised me with it as a gift for Christmas. We were both excited to plug it in and see all the games we played as kids but only about FIVE GAMES would load and play correctly! :( Huge disappointment except that the one game I really wanted to play was ""Pit Fall"" and that one loads up fine. Not sure if it's suppose to work better on one type of television verses another but my new flat screen wouldn't play it at all so I used the older television in my bedroom and that's when we got ""Asteroid"" ""Millipede"" ""Pit Fall"" and about 3 others to load...but since it boasts having so many games to play it really sucks that is all that I can get to work because I was looking forward to playing most of them. Seems most of the units got decent reviews, just not sure why my unit isn't working properly!!??"
5,Back to the 80's,"Looking for a Get Well gift for my husband, after a bad accident I came across this Atari Game system. My intentions were to spend the money over the Holiday season on a new game system worth 300+. But my husband did not want to hear of it. He loves this game, plays it daily, and couldn't be happier. He loves everything about it. Everyone who walks in our home "" just has to try it out"" and remember our youth.Thanks ATARI!"
