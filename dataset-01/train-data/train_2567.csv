4,"Hurry up, Cole, we're waiting for the next one.","Who cares if the characters are archetypes (P with H of G etc)? Who cares if we learn more about oil well drilling that we asked for? This book is wildly original, great fun, and full of suspense. I hope Thompson hasn't used up all his material, because I'm already looking for his next."
4,"A rollicking, fun read","Chocolate Lizards is as much fun as I think bringing up a gusher would be. I'm not a big fan of dialogue heavy with dialect, but it works here. So does the wonderfully lyric quality of the descriptions of the west Texas scenery. It's good work, and I hope there will be more."
4,A realistic and humorous look in to West Texas Oil Life.,"Fun to read, you wonder just what the heck is going to happen next.The charactors remind you of someone you know or know of you, even though hesterical, you realize that someone probably actually pulled off these stunts.Easy to read and completely entertaining."
1,"Great idea, but foul, foul, foul","Filled with another F, F, F word. Someone needs to write a book about the oil 'bidness' that doesn't make you feel like you've been dragged through the gutter. Read at your own risk."
1,Disappointed,"When i ordered this product i was very excited and i did receive it very fast. It fits perfectly but it is made from chenille, it did not mention that in the description if it had i would never had bought it especially at this price. Chenille is a dust magnet!!! and very hard to keep clean. Overall i would not recommend this product in this material."
5,Fabulous!,This book is the nourishment my soul has been hungering for. A must read for anyone longing to be touched by the healing power of God's love.
1,Nearly a total waste,"Do you know how to tell if an anatomy book is REALLY bad? When nearly HALF of the book is nothing but TEXT...That being said once you get past 1/2 of the book being utterly useless you move onto the actual ART of the book. All the diagrams are non-photo, pencil sketches. The sketches are fairly decent themselves but this book falls flat from introducing any special poses that an artist will be expected to handle (jumping) (crouching) (stretching) etc...I would give this book ZERO stars if I could, avoid this book and look elsewhere. I know that price tag looks mighty convincing but you get what you pay for (not much)."
3,"Excellent resource, but may not be what you're looking for.","I was very disappointed with this book initially, as I was needing a visual reference while learning figure drawing. It's mostly text (which is a lot for an over-sized book) and the plates feel somewhat tacked on. It would definitely benefit from being re-edited.There is an enormous wealth of information here though, and has proven to be a valuable addition to my drawing library as I've begun a more in-depth study of the human form.Eliot Goldfinger'sHuman Anatomy for Artists: The Elements of Formis by far my favorite anatomy book."
3,If you want to learn how to draw men this is a superb book.,"I have read many anatomy books, this book had good illustrations, but never the less it did no help me much on learning how to draw the female body, the book did not to deem it as important as the male body."
4,Artistic Anatomy,"This is a textbook format on muscle names, form and function with simple and diagrammatic drawings. It's a textbook format not a picture book. So if your looking for detailed info this is for you. Otherwise the anatomy coloring book is a better choice."
4,great material flawed layout,This is a classic anatomical text. The drawings in this book are scientifically accurate and elegantly interpreted. As opposed to Peck's Atlas of anatomy where the plates are quite clunky.The only qualm I have with this book is the fact that the text portion is difficult to use in conjunction with the illustrations. One needs to constantly flip back and forth from the plates to the text. One way to get around this is to photo copy the text portion and have it as a seperate pamphlet to refer to. One thing the Peck book has that would have been useful in this would have been a table of muscle origin and insertion points but since Dr.Richer is long since passed on I dont think that will happen.For the serious student of Anatomy this is required reading...and dont forget to draw all of the plates either.
5,Beautiful Journey,"Sufism is a complex spiritual path that asks the traveller to fulfil their potential as a human being. In this book, the author takes us through the journey of a true seeker, exploring the beautiful complexity and metaphysical wonders of the Sufi path. Moreover, the book is written with a strong academic foundation, appealing to the mystic and the scholar. A must have to truly understand Sufism."
4,i can tell that you are almost in love with me i can see it,"The first thing that strikes you about this album is the variety of songs.From the punk thrash of kung-fu to the slow and passionate melodrama of lost in you this is an exceptional album. Back when this album was released in 1996 ASH were a cocky 3 piece from a small town with big dreams and ambitions. This album established them in the industry and worked as a corner stone for there two more recent releases. The hit singles girl from mars,oh yeah and goldfinger are perfect catchy pop songs. loose control (which features on Gran turismo)trundles along at a frightening pace with guitar solos to die for.the (...) riffage on i'd give you anything acts is a punch to the gut of the critics. This album can be listined to before you go out, when you go out and the next morning . All in all i have been a fan of this record for many years and there is a song for every occasion i believe it has earned a place in every modern music fans collection."
4,A great summer album,"Ash have been hailed as ""the new Green Day"" without having made an album as annoying as Green Day. ""1977"" is a great album from start to finish, with some fancy guitar work and nicely produced musical textures. Next to ""Nevermind"", this is my favourite ""Alternative"" record. The highlight is the hidden track, which appears about 7 minutes after ""Darkside Lightside"" ends on the same track, it is 4 minutes of the bass player, very drunk, vomiting on the bathroom floor with the band cheering him on (the sound is very clear, so you can hear the rumbling and gurgling). Worth it just for that little gross out effect."
5,There Finest Moment,"What can you say about Ash that no one has ever said before. They are one of the best rock groups around. Tim Wheeler has an excellent voice and is able to combine great music with catchy lyrics. Featuring the singles Angel Interceptor, Girl From Mars, Kung Fu and Oh Yeah it proves that this album for anyone who appreciates good music. (check out Nu-clear sounds as well)"
4,"Some Great songs, Some Boring ones","Number 4 and 5 aren't listenable for me, Some of the songs on here go on too long without a sound from Tim, This happens in about 3 songs so basically You just have to click ""next song"" It is a good album though otherwise I wouldn't of gave it 4 stars. ""Girl from mars"" is a must have single with a great punky sound. ""Goldfinger"" is another brilliant song with good chorus. Lose Control isn't that good either, It was on Gran Turismo 1 and Don't think much of it. All the rest is listenable and Good though with the fast ""Kung Fu"" and the very catchy ""Oh Yeah"", ""Angel Interceptor"", ""Let It Flow"", ""Lost in you"" and ""Darkside Lightside"" are also great songs. 4 worst songs = ""Lose Control"", ""i'd Give you anything"", ""Gone the dream"" & ""Innocent Smile"" 4 best songs = ""Oh Yeah"", ""Girl From Mars"", ""Goldfinger"" & ""Kung Fu"" - All Their Releases. Can I say that the releases from ""Free all angles"" are also the best choices. They make the best choices for releases."
3,Something is lacking!,To say the thruth I enjoyed this cd. I bought it after listening to some songs from a jukebox. Some songs such as 'Let it Flow' and 'Kung Fu' are really cheery and chatchy. My favourite has to be 'Lost in You' which harks back in a way to a Beatles song. Some songs are really average though with long and boring guitar riffs which go on repeating forever (such as Dark and Lightside) My main grudge must be pointed towards the lyrics which mostly talk about love and girls and all this tripe (really uninspiring stuff). My advice is to listen to some songs before buying this.Just don't expect a classic which will grant you repeated listening. Eventually this will gather a lot of dust on your shelf.
2,This might be good if you're just getting into Rock music.,"I bought this when I was 15. I'm 18 now. I didn't particularly like it when I bought it - now it seems like faeces. Lose Control is okay, the rest are boring and generic beyond belief. If you like it - fine, hopefully it gets you into to rock music and then you eventually discover greater things. However, if you bought this, say, 3 years ago and still like/love it then your tastes haven't progessed - maybe you're fine with that and hey - Ignorance is bliss."
4,Great album! The songs have great hooks!,I just recently borrowed 1977 from my sister and I can't stop listening to it in my car! It's such a good album. The songs are all well thought out and contain catchy guitar playing as well as good vocal hooks. A good buy if you like listening to music that will get you going!
5,Give Ash the Godly status that they deserve,"This is officially the best C.D that I have ever heard in my life. Tim Wheeler's abilities for lyric and song writing are unbeatable. The progression from the sometimes repetitive songs on 'Trailer' to the magic of songs such as 'Goldfinger','Lost in you' and 'Loose control' is remarkable. I am sometimes amazed at the number of people who can't see that this band could be the greatest and why this album isn't at the front of their collection is a mystery. This album inspired me to buy their other albums and I will be an ardent fan forever. On hearing this album you should feel the same way."
5,BATMAN THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS PART 1,"I HAVENT EVEN SEEN THIS CARTOON AND I GAVE IT A 5, WHY BECAUSE I ALREADY KNOW IT WILL BE BETTER THAN THAT PIECE A CRAP BATMAN MOVIE I SAW THIS SUMMER. WHATA WASTE OF MY TIME. AS A LONG TIME BATMAN FAN THAT MOVIE SUCKED. WHERE WAS BATMAN. WHAT DID THEY DO TO BANE. WHERE WAS THE DARKNESS OF THE MOVIE. THE WHOLE STORY WAS A JOKE. THE ONLY GOOD PART OF THIS TRILOGY WAS THE FIRST MOVIE. OHYEAH LETS TALK ABOUT HOW THE AVENGERS AND SPIDERMAN KICKED THE CRAP OUT OF THIS MOVIE TO. A VERY DISAPOINTED FAN."
1,Animated,completely disappointed...need to state animated somewhere in the title. I would have never purchased had I known it was this type of movie.
1,what ?I am anidiot,"wow how dumb am I...great... an animated movie..at 60 yrs old I guess I cannot read anymore to know that this is a cartoon, og forbid, I mean a graphic novel...wasted time and money"
3,The story but no pow.,"Ok so this is the plot and story line of TDKR, but it does not have the power of the graphic novel. I recall reading TDKR in the 80s and it redefined Batman, telling a story that is both political and fantastical. By talking away the inner monologue, we do not get inside the old man that Bruce has become, nor do we feel the menacing on coming storm that the mutants are.Miller pushed the Batman myth and it was almost as if Batman pushed back, not wanting to become the character Miller was creating and between this push we got to read a remarkable story.And here is where the animated version falls flat, we must not push beyond what DC/Warner are doing with Batman now. So we get a watered down version of TDKR. I cannot wait to see how the SM moment of Cat Women dress as Wonder Women bound up by the Joker plays out."
2,Wasen't what I thought.,"I didn't know this was a cartoon. Made me sorry I even got it. Not to worry though, I can find a kid that might want it."
3,Rented it,Can;t really say much about this movie. I forgot to see it and now lost my chance. gotta rent it again.
1,DK returns part 1,Love the movie but just rate it here so low cause amazon sent it twice to me with missing items so I ended up getting at the wb store online but def a must buy for us dc animated fans animation in this Sucks hate it would prefer more of what they did in under the red hood n superman batman apocalypse
2,less than expected,Was expecting something else. Not expecting a cartoon. My mistake; I will be a little morecareful in the future.
2,Cyberpunk Batman,"Think: retiree Batman. But with mutants wearing visors, mohawks, and using...jive turkey slang? Don't get me wrong - Gordon, and Bruce are portrayed incredibly. Their old man dates with scotch, and war stories are extremely engaging character moments. But Peter Pan Robin, and the Cyberpunk thing is so cliché, and cheesy -- it takes me out of it. I haven't read the graphic, nor do I intend to after seeing this."
4,Deep and Dark,"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 takes almost an allegorical look at the topic of a society out of control, and the aspect of personal responsibility and empowerment. Definitely too heavy for the younger kids, but perhaps a bit thought provoking for the older crowd.Or, just Batman as he ought to be - tough and stubborn and unwilling to back down in the face of a vicious opponent."
5,Great Movie,Great edition to the Batman saga. Very enjoyable worth watching and was a great purchase. My family enjoyed watching the continuing saga of the Dark Knight.
5,"OMG I WAS TRICKED BY THIS MOVIES TITLE, MISLEADING!!!!!!","OMG. I am SOOOOO UBER MAD. THIS TITLE IS SOOOOO MISLEADING. I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS GONNA BE KNIGHT RIDER, WHERE THE HELL IS KITT AND THE HOFF?Seriously, Awesome movie. Kinda annoying that people who won't read the title and description throw one star reviews at it, complaining that it is animated. Geez..."
3,"not bad, but not great","Enjoyed the movie, and bought it the second it became available, but it pales in comparison to the source material, Frank Miller's original work. I read it when it first came out and it helped to elevate what comics could be. IMHO, this one the top 5 comics of all time and is responsible for Batman's revival as relevant Character.The animation was OK, but not great. The voice acting was good.I hope this is made into a live action movie at some point. Nolan could do it justice.This is THE seminal Batman story that all others since owe a great debt. Any true Batman fan should read the comic/graphic novel.I enjoyed the extras and am looking forward to the next installment."
4,Excited to see part II,"Very good & generally true to original story line, animated version of Frank Miller's classic. Recommended for any Batman or Frank Miller fan."
3,Fairly straightforward,"A pretty bland interpretation of the source material sans the inner monologue that really MADE Batman a character. Alot of the staging was flat and coincidentally so were the majority of vocal performances. I feel like Peter Weller went in to the booth and they just used his first take on every line.In a cartoon you expect things to be amped up just a little bit, this felt more like a storyboard with how little things actually moved and how flat every composition was. I think the ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" episode of Batman: TAS did a much better job of interpreting the source material.That said, if you've never read the comic, this is probably going to be at least mildly enjoyable. I'm glad I rented and didn't buy. I'd suggest you do the same. Enjoy!"
4,Near Perfect First -Half Adaptation of the Graphic Novel that Changed Everything,"Part One of this adaptation is spot-on. Because the illustration is so crucial to this story, it could only be animated, not live action. The voices are great, as well. Unfortunately for part two, the voice of the Joker was chosen very, very poorly, all but destroying the character from the book (TDKR's Joker should be voiced by Tim Curry, not Beavis). I intend to skip all the Joker parts of part two (they REALLY screwed this up!), but Part One is terrific. My only criticism of part one is that much of the terrific narration from Batman/Bruce Wayne was omitted, lines that helped create the tone of the book. However, the Mutants seem to have retained the cool language of the graphic novel, and for that I am grateful. Oh, and you hear the Joker at the end, which left me eager to skip part two."
4,Extra-ordinary,"The movie is good,I can't get enough of batman. It's was a good idea to finally cast him as the old man he is, but it's time to totally update. Like the movie, it's time for Bruce Wayne to retire, let a new guy come in, drop the cape, and develop that prototype suite with the awesome capabilities. But before that, make a last mission with the old Batman, and the aging Nightwing. That Nightwing in the story of the Redhood was totally WRONG"""
4,Faithful adaptation,"It has been many years since I read The Dark Knight Returns, but from what I remember this is a faithful adaption of Miller's work."
4,a good movie overall,"This movie was good however I have read the comic and because of that I was always comparing it to the comic and therefore this movie fell a bit short of my expectation, the comic was freaking amazing and the movie even though being good in it own right, doesn't come close to having the psychological effect on its audience like the comic does. But once again, a good movie never the less."
5,A wonderful adaption,"First things first, every single one star review for this is people who are complaining that they were ""duped"" or ""scammed"" because they thought it was the Christopher Nolan movie The Dark Knight Rises. You weren't scammed or duped or bait and switched in any way because A: It's a different name B: had an entirely different cast C: Has a different plot. If you order something without reading the title or description then any mistakes are your own fault.As for an actual review I should preface it by saying The Dark Knight Rises is one of my favorite comics of all time. I was hesitant that it wouldn't be a faithful adaption but it really does do a tremendous job. It captures the tone and feel of the comics exactly. Just because it's animated doesn't mean its for kids. It's pretty bloody and there's lots of violent themes and imagery. But yeah, I love this and can't wait for part 2 to be released."
3,It's Bat Man not Robocop,I prefer Conroy's voice over Weller's but it was OK. I did have to watch it twice as I nodded off during the first viewing.
2,dark knight falls short,"its a shame. not a BAD animated movie by any means.. just Far from great and im sorry but PeterWeller as batman did NOT WORK. he sounded the same thru the entire thing!!monotone , no emotion.. it took me right out of it"
3,"The Batman, is he too old?","I thought the dark night was protrayed to be to old and slow, I know we all age with time, but a super hero does not age like normal people. He should have been protrayed to be wiser but not that old."
4,Good start to the greatest Batman story of all time,The book is the essential Batman book.If not for this book you would not have had the Tim Burton Batman or the Chris Nolan Batman.This book re-invented Batman and is responsible for what he is today.That being said I always found the first half to be weaker than the second half.But this is a great start!After seeing Part 1 I couldn't wait to see Part 2!
4,Timeless story of Justice!,"I love the story line because it shows that even heros age too! More often than not, stories have a way of making heros timeless and people who stay frozen in a moment never aging, never dying."
4,must have for batman fans,"Good film, pretty good adaptation of the graphic novel. The dark knight returns is one of the best story of batman. The animation was great but the only down side is that this is only part one."
4,Down & Dirty,"This was a great dark Dark Knight tale. I especially like seeing Bruce Wayne as an old man since the majority of Batman lore has him young and in his prime. It's nice to see how an aging Bats fares against younger opposition. If you are a Batfan, I highly recommend checking it out, esp. in anticipation of Part 2."
3,ok,Batman is old and out of shape... but somehow comes back after 10 years and is the same ole crime fighter? Not buying it. Storyline is nothing original.
4,Batmaaaaan,"Sure, it's a cartoon..... but it gives you a look at a fairly grizzled, battle torn, and aged Bruce Wayne. With all the moves, gadgets, and dry whit you would expect from Bruce Wayne and company, this is a solid film that is worth checking out."
4,WOW! AWESOME!,"I enjoyed this a great deal, epic! I enjoyed how the new Robin found Batman, and how he accepted her. I am looking forward to part 2."
4,This is a good animated version.,"You can read over 200 other opinions on this story. All i want to say is that this is a good ""animated"" version of the comic. You want the comic version? GET THE GRAPHIC NOVEL!!! C'mon people, why the heck would we want an exact copy of the graphic novel? If you have not read the graphic novel, watch this animated version first. Of course by watching the animation, you can expect the graphic novel to be much better. Therefore a double treat of the same story.Stop crying and enjoy a story for what it is: a story."
5,Terrific!,"In the 80's, I was reintroduced to comics by reading the Dark Knight Returns and the Killing Joke books. I was instantly hooked on the Batman again. The darker tone captivated me, as the writing was not kiddie stuff, but good enough for grownups to read and contemplate.This movie follows the graphic novel faithfully; very minor deviations.I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the Dark Knight Return books years ago, and to anyone who likes the current Dark Knight movies. I hope the follow up is as good as the first.Hey DC, how about a Killing Joke movie? Guess that might have to be rated ""R"", huh?"
5,Great movie in Blu Ray,"I very much enjoyed watching this movie, and would reommend it to other for the enjoyment of all the action."
4,Good adaptation of the classic Graphic Novel,"This is a good adaptation as stated above. Took a while to get into the voice acting not because I dislike Peter Weller's acting, but because I'm such a fan of the work done previously by Kevin Conroy multiple times in this animated role. It started out a bit slow, but eventually it picked up speed. I found this first part to have a decent balance of ""talking"" scenes as well as action scenes that were in the story to serve a purpose. Some previous DTV DC animated movies are all action and become redundant and almost senseless in spots, but here the action and fight scenes have more weight to them and the storytelling of the framed moving art is beautiful to watch – never confusing. I can't want to view the second part soon!"
1,Not Good,I didn't know the movie was a cartoon. I was ready to watch the latest Batman movie and got a cartoon. I didn't watch the movie.
1,Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1,"This movie is animated, it was definitely not what we were ordering. Looking at the featured ad, what you can't see because it is unreadable is that this choice is the ANIMATED version, this is in very small print on top the the word BATMAN. When we ordered this we thought it was the original movie version."
1,this is an animated feature,"I thought this was the movie being shown and talked about on the radio and TV, that is just now out on DVD. Seems to have the same title. I don't get it. THIS IS A CARTOON - ANIMATED MOVIE - I do not know where the real movie is??? Can't find it on Amazon... Just a couple of days ago they showed the actor on ET and a scene from the movie where he said something like ""Gotham needs me again""... They also said the DVD contained a bonus on the different Bat Mobiles. I tried to watch the 1st 10 minutes and could not, too much like a comic book.I guess I have to spend some time in Google to find the actual movie..."
1,SCAMMED,"I should have read the reviews...then I would have known that this video is NOT the real version but a cartoon. BUYER BEWARE!!! Amazon, you need to start giving refunds for this bait and switch routine."
5,Awesome!!!,The best animated DC film to date. I can't wait for part two. A must have for any batman fan.
3,It's ok,"Mistaken this one for the full movie, but the kids watched it anyway, they thought it was cool enough but adults didn't enjoy it."
3,Wrong Movie,Only purchased this because we thought that it was the new batman movie but it turned out to be an animated film. Should have read better before i lost 4 dollars to it.
3,Great movie but its should not be a two parter!,"This a great movie, but its should a whole story instead of a two parter, I read the book version, so I already know how this going to end!"
2,Not,"I didn't like this at all. I guess I should have read more , I was disappointed that this movie was an adult cartoon ."
4,Batman movies are always great,I'm a big fan of Adma West's version of batman but the gritty... dark batman is wonderful. All of them- and seeing bruce get old and how he still feels like he wants to brawl is how you expect batman to end up
4,Good movie,This isn't exactly the live action type of Batman but it was good. The artwork was great. The story is classic Batman.
5,YES YES AND MORE YES,"This movie was just great! For all batman/superhero fans you will undoubtedly enjoy this. I cannot believe I had no idea that they came out with this. I accidentally found it by searching for the Dark Knight Rises Blue Ray, and I am so glad I came across this. I will wait & check everyday for part 2. If you haven't seen this already, watch the trailer and see it immediately...you won't be disappointed."
4,Batman cartoon movie,"The kids like it. I didn't really appreciate it, but I'm not the target audience. The CG is strictly at comic-book quality, flat images, and wide-jawed heros. I couldn't sit through it, but the kids seem to love it, so I gave it four stars. If it was for adults, it'd be, at most, one star."
3,Peter Weller???,"I must say that I am a huge fan of the all the DC Animation movies so far and was really looking forward to this but I have to say Peter Weller as Bruce Wayne / Batman ruined it for me. There was no inflection in his voice during the entire movie. It was the same mono-toned, grave and slow speech regardless of when he was speaking with Gordon or speaking with the Mutant leader. Why not re-cast Micheal Ironside who did a great job when they visited The Dark Knight Returns on the animated series.Other than Weller, I think they stayed as true to the source material as their budget allowed and is definitively worth a watch."
4,Almost perfect,I loved the comic and this in my opinon the best they could do and to people giving this bad review because its animated stop and think why would the release nolans third movie in parts and just because its animated means that its for kids and cant be entertaing
4,Great First Part!,"DC animation has nailed it again! If you are a batman fan, you will love this. If you just like a good story and know a little about Batman, you will also really enjoy this.Quick overview:Set in the future, an aging Batman comes out of retirement. He's still built like a linebacker and hits like a truck, but his body (and mind) constantly remind him that he's no longer in his prime. This is a dark and angry Batman. He's almost unbalanced mentally. He is still sharp, don't get me wrong, but... well you just need to watch it :)."
5,Awesome,I just loved it.. Shows a new dimension to the Dark Knight never though of.. Awesome that he will be training a new Robin who is female. Awesome!!!
5,The Legend Ends,This is a very faithful adaptation of Frank Millers graphic novel. I can only hope the 2nd half lives up to this first half of it. I really love the sound track to this movie and will buy it on I tunes if available
2,Dark knight returns,"I have not seen this movie, nor will I. Consumers should be aware. This is NOT ""DARK KNIGHT RISES"" with Christian Bale. It is a play on titles."
2,boo,"Didn't like this movie, didn't realize it was animated; guess I will read movie description more carefully next time I rent a movie."
2,"When they said it was an ""all new original movie"" I didn't expect to get some old rehash. of","When they said it was an ""all new original movie"" I didn't expect to get some old rehash of Frank Miller's original work."
2,I am so sick of UV Digital Copy. Give me my iTunes Digital Copy,"The movie is great, and I am sure most fans of the DC animated shows/movies will love it. But I am so tired of all of these films coming with UV instead of iTunes Digital copies."
3,"Thought it was rises, poor packaging and advertisisng","OK so I am stupid. Make that too busy, and not enough time to run to the movies. I depended on the advertisemnet of this that it was The Dark Knight Rises. Its not. Its animated and its not even the same name. Shame on me for buying, shame on Amazon for poor advertising. It did not clearly say ""ANIMATED."" I wont even open it, and may try and resell. I'll definetely read more carefully in the future."
2,animated?,I did not know this was an animated movie. There is nothing in the title description that mentions this being an animated version of the movie!
2,It's a cartoon,"Just to let you folks who are renting & not buying know, this is a cartoon and you should be aware it is poorly illustrated in my opinion."
5,Solid Movie,This is a great movie for the Batman fan in your life. It arrived safe and sound and made the person I got it for very happy!
3,Batman: The Dark Night returns,Animated. New twist to the Batman story. It reflects on Commisioner Gordan and Bruce Waynes beginning. Developing into their relationship as crime fighting.
4,True to the comic,"This movie was true to both the plot and and the art of the original comic. If you're looking to purchase this because you enjoyed Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"" you will not be disappointed.A warning to the wise consumer: They have divided four issue comic series into two movies. This movie ends at the same point as ""The Dark Knight Triumphant."" Therefore you may wish to wait until Part 2 or a combo set is available."
1,overpriced animation,"This was NOT worth the rental fee. maybe at $1 it would be, but I was not pleased. my fault for not better screening it."
1,No comics please.,It should make it clear that this is a comic. I was expecting a standard movie. Not bad for a comic film if one is into taht kind of thing. but in that case animation is lacking luster.
1,A Mistake,"Once I realized that this movie was a ridiculous animation I immediately stopped watching it. I would rather lose 3.99 than waste my time. The movie should have been clearly labelled ""animated""; instead they lure viewers in by obscuring this fact. As the saying goes, ""Let the buyer beware""."
1,Thought it was the movie version,"What a rip off. Amazon should look into better describing some of there items. The price was ridiculously high. I watched it since I paid for it, very disappointing and a waste of money and time."
1,Mislead,I rented this movie on accident thinking it was the new Batman. This is a CARTOON if anyone else gets mislead as well. Very disappointed.
1,"An ""Animated"" Dark Knight Returns","I must have missed the ""Animated"" portion of the description for this movie before I ordered it. My wife and I were quite disappointed that it was a cartoon. On the positive side, Amazon refunded my money for the purchase and I plan thoroughly review the description next time before I even put a movie on my Watchlist."
1,Sucked in,I thought I was ordering Batman Returns. Did not notice it was a cartoon. Will read the blurb more closely next time but I still feel that I was deceived.
3,Takes me back,"I liked the graphic novel decades ago, and this captures some of the feel...perhaps not quite as darkly brilliant as I remember the source material. It was good enough that I'll at least watch part 2, but may try to rent it."
4,Batman Never Dies,"This is one movie in a long line of thoughtful and entertaining animated features of Batman. This older Batman shows that he still has the spirit, if not the physical talents he had in his prime, to fight for Gotham. Batman is my favorite superhero; he kicks tail with nothing but determination. This movie exemplifies that."
5,The Dark knight,This is based on the Dark Knight Returns and wow they did a great job. An older meaner and more violent Batman..
2,Not so much Dark Knight,Production quality of this film was so so and it didn't hold up at all to the classic graphic novel in any way. Warner Brothers dropped the ball when it came to this title and ruined it's legacy.
4,Faithful Interpretation,"I enjoyed The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 very much. It was faithful to the original and I thought Peter Weller did a nice job as the aging Batman. The film did leave me wanting for Part 2, which I guess could be both good or bad for some viewers. However, it still felt like a complete movie. I would recommend if you are a fan of Frank Miller's original, but not for kids."
5,Awesome movie!,"I really love the whole movie and all the twists it has, there's also a few things that I was not expecting. The animation is well made and voice acting was superb. Batman is super dark in this one and I really love it."
4,Solid,"This was a good movie, but you'll have to keep an open mind. It is certainly worth the rental if you're a fan of the animated DC movies."
4,Very well done,pros: -Voice acting is good this batman sounds like a weathered old war veteran which in a sense is all too true a-animation is a unique smooth style that looks good-action sequences blend realistic/gritty urban terrorist situations with DC/comic book action to bring a unique spin on the usually predictable superhero genre-pacing is good enough so that you crave watching part II ASAP!cons: news commentary seem very lifeless and drawn outsome plot threads seem introduced then cast off in secondssome inner monologue missing from batman as we'd like to see what he thinks from time to time of whats going on around himAll in all i'd say an 8.5/10 very well done and action packed for 1/2 a movie
3,nice batman,"I really enjoyed the movie, it is by no means no ""red hood"" but it is cool. The story line could have been developed a little more but it stands ok on it own."
4,Batman fans will love this,It really felt like the graphic novel had come to life. Wonderful story and artwork! This was bought for my boyfriend who is the ultimate Batman fan and he loved it.
1,Not worth the money,"Reading the reviews I almost feel like we are talking about 2 totally different items.Yes, the mask is well molded but the paint...the paint is atrocious.One of the other reviewers mentions a wash over the silver, mine doesn't have that, it is bright silver with streaks were the red undercoat shows through. Indeed, it looks like it was stuffed in the bag / box while still wet.The inside is comfy but I too have the red goo inside.I think this may be a case of a production change mid run. I'd love to know what % of these are returned.Long story short, I'm sending it back."
1,LAST WARNING,"This is a terrible product for 40$ (i had to pay 70 because of shipping) I thought it was supposed to be made out of metal...its not its plastic...I thought it was supposed to be silver like in the movie...like its advertized in front of the box cover...its not..its bronze... I am udderly ashasmed to have bought this product, dont waste your time here. NECA has failed."
4,Not as bad as they say it is.,"I actually think this mask is worth the money, its really sturdy, the paint on mine is flawless, and there is no red melting stuff on my face since there is a black cloth inside thing along with three nice face pads, my paint is perfect, its got color variations like the masks in the movies and the ridges are accented well with a darkened metal finish, its really not that bad. you people are being to critical, painting chrome on metal is really hard."
4,Glad I got to see this one!,"My daughter told me to go see this movie while it was in the theater, and I was lucky to catch it during its brief run. As someone who works in the field of education, I was struck by this film's ability to handle such a multi-faceted issue with an amazing amount of clarity and specificity. I think US/Cuba relations are incredibly complicated and it is often hard to understand the intricacies of these countries' relationship. I remember thinking, ""I can't understand how this event could have happened."" In just an hour and a half, I walked away with a lot of history and a lot of insight, something that is hard to do with such big issues and big questions. I recommend this movie to anyone, especially those who work in education. It is a great resource for beginning the conversation on the topic of international relations."
2,Not great,It was ok. I strongly dislike the character that has an empathy for machines. Just ridiculous. And he was one of the cruxes of the story! Brian Lumley's other works (Fruiting Bodies) is far superior.
3,Nice guide,"Small and compact, this pocket-sized book provides a good introduction to prehistoric life, how organisms fossilize, and how man then discovers, extracts and analyzes these fossils. The book is written both as an educational guide and a field guide; something that can be used in the classroom or out in the field when actually looking at or for fossils. The text is simple enough for highschoolers to understand, but contains a lot of information. Good addition to the libraries of those who like fossils, or just glossing over nice color illustrations of ancient organisms such as dinosaurs."
3,haven't gotten it,well i ordered these books over a month ago and still have not gotten this one. Its amazing to me. Maybe someday it will show up at the house.
4,Good pan for the money spent,I love this pan it is perfect for making pancakes or a few grilled cheeses.
5,A beautiful book,"Stitches, the baseball, was not perfect but he had his own dreams. His journey to the realization of his dreams is one which will hold a child's attention. The journey is filled with setbacks and difficulties; but in the end it is worth the trip.Kevin does not reveal the journey's end along the way. He keeps that secret and thereby keeps us reading.There is a lesson to learn from Stitches, one that all of us need to learn in order to make the most of our lives: Dreams come true in ways we least expect.This 32 page book is beautifully illustrated in full color and enhances the story.The younger child will enjoy listening as the story is read to him/her and the older child will find the language easy to comprehend without being too simple. This will make a great gift that will be read over and over."
5,This Book is Really Worth It!,"This book has enabled my child to be very organized for school. His teachers are really impressed with his improvement in homework skills and now he can find everything he needs. I'm thoroughly pleased with the tips, and the authors did a wonderful job making this handbook an easy read for busy parents! Thanks so much for the information!"
1,Who the hell are these CrackPots?,"First off, the guitaring, [was bad] right up the nose.The guy's vocals weren't in the right key.The bass lines were all wrong...horrible.It [made me mad] when I heard the vulgarity of this band's tribute.Forwarn, DO NOT BUY THIS LAME EXCUSE FOR A TRIBUTE.Thank you."
1,IT SUX,This tribut sux. its just a bunch of people making poor sounding copies of some of Sum 41 's songs. Now im a HUGE Sum 41 fan and let me tell you the songs sound nothing like Sum 41. So if you dont wanna waste like 12 bucks DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!!! it really sucks
1,pointless,"I love Sum41, ... I don't know who would bother making a tribute CD to Sum I mean they have only been around for a few years and they aren't even dead yet. I think that the covers are not just bad quality, but bad well... everything. I am also surprised to find this CD on this site considering I can't always find good and legitimate bands here. I think that you should definitely listen to the samples before you buy this because it is nowhere near the quality of sum41's real CDs."
2,"Yeah, right.","The songs speak for them selves. If you plan on, or are thinking about buying to this CD, listen to the tracks on the tribute, and actual Cds first. The tribute CD is entertaining, but not nearly as god as the real thing. It lacks the attitude of Sum. If you don't believe me, listen to the tracks!"
1,Not a real CD,"If your considering buying this CD, you might want to know that Sum 41 did not issue permission for this CD. Sum 41's management did not put out this CD nor do they know who did."
1,A disgrace to any Sum41 fan,If you are a sum41 fan dont buy this album. The songs sound horrible and if this is their only tribute album then they will be remembered for the worst tribute album in history. Trust me on this and dont waste your money. You could hear better versions of the sum songs from the band The Footlongs and John.
1,what a waste of time,just warning any people who actually considering to buy this CD to think again.. i laugh at the fact that they even took time to register to put this CD on the website.. this is no tribute to sum 41 they dont even sing some of the songs in tune.
1,a disgrace to SUM 41,"Sum 41 is a great band. I have both their albums and love every song on them. This tribute is an insult to them. And as much as I love Sum 41 it is way to soon to have a tribute album. To anyone who is considering buying this CD please, I am begging you to re-consider. If you are into Sum 41 then buy Half Hour of Power or All Killer No Filler. And if you do not want to buy both then I suggest thier first album Half Hour of Power. All I can say is please don't waste your money on this. Buy the real thing because both CDs are really great and this tribute is just a substitute!"
1,BUTCHERD,Talentless vocals...listen to the whining sample of handle this and you'll see... embarrasment...thanks to the others that prevented me from buying this!
1,Say it ain't so!!!,This is a joke. This CD is an insult to Sum 41 and any honest fan should not buy it. It really slaughtered the song 'Fat Lip' because the singer was stumbling and fumbling through the lyrics. I was almost convinced that it was recorded while someone was singing in the shower... What kind of a tribute is that?
2,What a waste,I bought this product to spice up my love life with my husband and to be completely honest with you it doesn't work. there was no difference at all really. so please please please save your money and don't even bother buying this product. something like this you know is too good to be true and it ends up being a waste of time and money.
1,not effective,"This cologne evaporates very fast, smell is not too bad but my husband doesn't even notice it on me as he notice every other parfume I ware!Waste of money! But thanks for shipping it in a timely manor!"
3,ILOVE IT BUT,YOU HAVE TO CARRY IT WITH YOU SMELL DONT LAST EXCEPT WHEN YOU SWEAT I PUT A LIL BIT ON MY BOXERS IN THE AM AND IN THE PM YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS LOL
3,Not sure this works,"I gave this product as a gift and when I talked to the recipient, she says she can't tell any difference at all when she's wearing it. Evidently it hasn't attracted members of the opposite sex. (Oh well... I tried!) I smelled it and it smells nice and fruity, so even if the pheromones aren't working, at least you have a nice smelling cologne. Overall I think it's worth a shot because it's not that expensive and maybe it works differently on different people."
5,Amazing,This stuff really works. It boosted my confidence and made me feel more relaxed. It smells kind of fruity....and it is very mild. It compliments any fragrance that I wear with it. Very affordable as well. I am a satisfied customer.
3,It's alright,"I really like this scent. It's sweet and clean. However, it doesn't last very long. When I put it on my skin I can smell it for a few minutes and then nothing. If you smell it straight from the bottle it kinda smells like starburst, but when you add it to your skin the scent changes. For me it's a sweet flowery smell, I want to say almost gardenia-like."
2,"Too sweet, too strong","I was hoping this would be a nice smell, but it gave me awful headache within minutes after putting it on. Way too sweet and too powdery smell. Do not like it and do not see any changes in my man's reaction to me. Doing fine without it."
3,ugh,"It smells really good. I wore it the gym and a couple of bars and not one number or attention! It's weird because it worked for my mom, she got a $500 bonus check. I guess It depends on your luck"
1,It was broken when recieved...,"I know this is a late review because it was months ago, when I recieved it it was broken... It smelled nice and yet disappointed with the cheap packaging, bought from Jelique. I will order again soon, please fix it... I forgot to contact the seller..."
1,Stink,"I could not believe I purchased this Cologne, the exact stinky scent that I have smelled from another co worker...DId not want to throw it in the trash! Left it in a public restroom for anyone to try...GROSS!!! A complete WASTE of $$$"
1,THIS IS A KNOCK OFF - GO TO PASSION PARTY.COM,"I bought the original at a passion party for $22 dollars and it was worth every penny it lasted months with daily usage I only applied it once in the morning and the scent lasted all day. Then when I finally ran out I came across it here for less than half what I originally paid, so I decided to give it a try. I was very disappointed because while it smells similar the scent goes away after just 1 hour at the most.I went through a bottle in less than a month.Needless to say I went to the Passion Party website and purchased the original at regular price.If you like this I strongly reccommend you try the original - you will not be sorry you did!!!"
3,"Nice smell, not sure it works...","I'm an exotic dancer and I've been wearing this stuff to work for a while now just to see if it works. So far I haven't seen much of a difference in men's reactions to me when I wear it vs when I leave it off. It smells nice by itself, like cucumber-melon body spray, but it wears off after about 1-2 hours and I need to reapply. Don't think I'm going to invest in any more once this bottle wears out since I was looking for working pheromones primarily, but at least it smells yummy on its own."
2,Not quite worth it,"It doesn't work at all, but it smells good. The only problem is that the scent doesn't last for very long. It's not really worth it to buy in my opinion"
1,?????!!?????,i dont think it does what it says. was skeptical newys but read decent reviews on its scent. so was hoping to use as good scent at least.. smells weird tho... n half was gone when i opened envelope. it leaked. bottled poorly.
1,Awful,"It smells like perfume not cologne. Not for men. Do not be confused by the advertised ""cologne"". I threw it in the trash."
3,smells ok but doesnt last long,has a nice smell but it doesn't last long.when you put it on your skin be careful it does cause a minor skin irritation.
4,This is the best bang for your buck!,"This stuff smells good and works pretty well, I have used some other products that don't compare to this! It's very cheap and it works...much better than spending $70 on some other products!!"
2,Pure instinct pheromone cologne,Pure instinct pheromone cologne. This oil has a light scent. Not sure if the pheromones work so I can't comment on that. Shipping was fast. Not sure if I would recommend or buy again.
3,its an ok product!,"Well I like the scent but not love it. When I first put it on I felt a warming sensation. As far as noticing guys ""hitting on me"" more than usual, not really. The only compliment I got was from my work partner who said I smelled heavenly after ofcourse I realized I didn't close the bottle right and it leaked all over my pocket. That's why I gave it 3 stars."
4,"Not sure that it does what it says, but my boyfriend likes it.","I use this stuff mostly for the scent. It has a very pleasant, soft scent that enhances my regular perfume. My boyfriend really likes it, but I think it's mainly for the scent, not because of some attractant power. I don't get hit on more or anything.I've read that Pherlure and Athena both really do work if you are looking for something effective. They are both more pricey, but I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Best Cologne Ever,This cologne is wonderful. It doesn't take much and it is unique to each person. you put a couple drops wherever you want to and the fragrance is based on you skin and temperature and I'm sure other things too but I smell like fruit a friend of mine smells like flowers and I'm sure there are many different fragrances it becomes depending on the person. The pheremone part works pretty well too.
5,smells delicious,"absolutely am in love with this!!! the smell is just amazing. I have been using pheramones for about a year now and this one smells great and last about 4-6 hours. I have learned that not all men respond to the same perfume, cologne, lotion etc... so I have many and mainly use them around my husband. now if this came in edible glitter I do believe this product would receive a 10!!! enjoy so far so amazing :)"
5,SEXY FEELING,mixed this with avon's diamond body spray works really good got more kisses from my bf ...guys stopped to ask me directions on the street...I dont know to me the effect seemed positive. would buy again
2,A clunker from a great band,"I love Los Lobos! I have six of their albums and have had the good fortune to have seen them several times. However, this album is uninspired and horrid compared to other great Los Lobos albums like ""Kiko"" or ""How Will Wolf Survive."" Perhaps it is the greater expectations that I have for this band that cause me to take a less than flattering view of this album, perhaps. But I don't think so. I am shocked by all of the five star ratings in here. This is a very short album with hastily put together blues jams that lack much innovation or creativity. Did these people actually listen to this CD or are they just so loyal to the band that they will not speak the truth? I love them and can say without a doubt that this is their worst album."
2,Disappointing Follow-Up!,"I could hardly believe my ears when In first listened to this album. I know I may have had too high expectations to this follow-up album to their masterpiece ""Kiko"". I gave it many chances, hoping to discover great moments that I might have overheard the first times; but somehow they never seemed to appear.As usual the playing is impeccable, but the great problem with this album in general is the lack of good songs. The first track ""Revolution"" is not a bad track, but not up to Los Lobos` normal high standards; but still one of the best efforts on this album.Next track to really capture my attension is ""Manny`s Bones""; among the previous 6 tracks there have been some solid blues-based efforts; but none of them particularly memorable. The same can be said about tha last three tracks. If I were to compile a Los Lobos compilation, I think I would only consider the 2 before mentioned tracks.On second thoughts, Im pretty sure I would include ""Revolution""."
4,On the Road With Agatha,"When last we saw her, Agatha had just managed to escape from Castle Wulfenbach with the failed King of Cats Krosp. But no sooner does their escape begin than they crash into the wastelands. There they meet a lost boy and join up with a traveling Heterodyne show. But in typical Girl Genius fashion, things just keep happening to complicate things.Destructive devices, a visit from the Baron, the return of Othar, demonic beasts, and mysterious travelers all manage to complicate matters. Amongst the jokes and action we also get a little more history about the Herterodynes and their impact on the world. We also learn a little more about what it takes to be a spark.This volume collects the last four issues of the Girl Genius comic (issues 10-13) as well as the continuing story from the Girl Genius online comic. Like in earlier volumes this collection also contains a stand-alone adventure at the end. All in all 127 pages of comic and comedic genius."
5,Errata,Note that this (excellent) book is shown with the wrong cover. See Kaja Foglio's livejournal for the correction.
4,Most Consistent Girl Genius Volume So Far,"""Circus of Dreams"" is the fourth ""Girl Genius"" collection (10-13 of the comic series, and the start of the web version), starting after Agatha and the talking cat Krosp have escaped into the (highly dangerous) wilderness. It lacks some of the great frantic feel of the latter part of ""Monster Engine"" but still has some excellent passages.The art is slowly improving - the exaggerated expressions still don't work sometimes (mostly on distant characters where there's not enough room) but there's less of a problem with characters looking like posed dolls. Most of the action revolves around Agatha and the traveling circus she runs into; like a the comic in general, the circus is a creative bit of fun, and the Foglios use it well.The setting change requires only a slight break in stride - this is the most consistent of the Girl Genius volumes so far, and the most entertaining. ****1/2"
2,"Ok, but could be better.","This book covers a lot of the basics of what HLA is but contains holes. After reading this book three times I am still left with questions as to how to implement HLA in an application. I [...] still have unanswered questions as to how to implement the HLA. The examples in the book are implemented in Java [...] however I would have been happier if the examples were implemented in C++ as well. This is a good starting point, in the absence of alternatives, but could be better."
1,No context,"This provides a decent overview of HLA, but like the other reviewer, I found the book hard to read -- it just didn't put any of the HLA into context with other simulation systems.For building these systems, I found the Singhal/Zyda book more useful in covering the ""nuts and bolts."" This book make alot more sense afterward."
3,"OK, but not great","HLA has been around now for a long time and I think it's telling that this is the only real book on the topic. If you are working with HLA, this is a good reference, but you will still need some serious time with the documentation for whatever RTI you end up using. I suspect that some day HLA will be replaced with something better, but it doesn't seem to be coming soon."
1,Disappointed,"This book is loaded with pompous ""computer science speak"". The real information could likely be condensed to 10 pages. The dearth of books available in this field left me at the mercy of this book. It was obviously written for people who already understand the subject (like the authors). I think I'll return it to them as it is something only its mother could love."
2,spoilt adapter,when i got the moniter i said it was cool and alright but whe i plugged it in it did nat work and i was angry.i tried again but it did not work so i tried to send it back but it was to much of a hassle.i decided t see what was the problem and send it to a electronics store and the told me the the ic was bad.the only thing i could have done is to buy a new adapter.so i paid 800 trinidadian dollars to get it to work.i was furious.
3,Nice Monitor,"I got this monitor at work. My model # is AL1913 b. Mine is not a wide-screen. The one thing that I quickly noticed was that it is a very light monitor compared to the one at my home 2005FPW. The things that I miss in this is a DVI adaptor. Can connect to only one PC, that is, doesn't have two monitor ports. Otherwise, I like this panel."
5,Great monitor,"This monitor is excellent. It is model AL 1913 b. Clarity, sharpness and contrast are top of the line. No dead pixels either. Amazon's shipping - had it at my door in two days. Fantastic as always.To the reviewer who gave 3 stars....read description, this monitor is Analog monitor. Pay more and you will have both, analog and digital input. Don't give three stars for something you anticipated and did not pay attention in product description."
2,Nice but not good for every day use,"I bought this stroller because it looked nice and sturdy. I liked the stroller with air-filled wheels and other features such as brake and wheel-locks. However, this stroller is so cumbersome if you have a compact car. Even with my Acura, I still have to take apart the front wheel to fit the stroller in the trunk. Imagine you have your kid and have to assembly your stroller in a before your walk. It's inconvenient and takes up lots of space in your car's trunk. I was mislead by Amazon description of the stroller that it would fit in trunk of any car. Yes it would fit but you have to take apart the front wheel to make it fit in."
2,Boring Non-Christmas Sounding Tracks,Pretty dull - lots of noddling non-descript chill that is certain not Christmas Chill ... most tracks sound great- solid chill - but then the vocals start and it rapidly descends into muzak. There are a handful tracks worthwhile but not even what you would call a great chill track - hopefully this will be offered as a digital mp3 album and you can ust pick out the tracks you want.
3,Not ferret-proof,"This litter pan is a great size, easy for ferrets to get in and out of, and no 'over shooting' thanks to the high sides. However, we bought it because of the locking mechanism, maybe it works to hold it in place against a guinea pig attack, but against determined ferrets it was useless. It took my rottens about 10 minutes to bust the lock off, and now we're back to pushing the litter pan around the cage and knocking it over when they're throwing a fit."
5,It's big!,"I have two ferrets and they refuse to use the corner box if there is more then a few poos in it. With two corners to back into, they seem to be content with using it for a longer period.I currently have the common ""My First Home Deluxe 2x2 Multi-Level"" from SuperPet. This box won't fit into the cage so until my ferret nation cage arrives it is an outside of the litter box cage. The like it but unless the opening is large on your ferrets cage it probably wont fit into the cage."
5,awesome for ferret,"My ferret had a nasty habit of pulling his litter box out of the corner and going on the cage floor. this lock on cage fixed that problem very very well.attaching it to the cage is easy and the lock is sturdy enough though if my ferret was more determined to move it he could probably break the lock (not easily, but after some time)this is the BEST ferret litter box i have ever owned, i've tried 3 kinds before this.if you have ferrets who like to pull out their litter boxes i HIGHLY suggest buying this!!! (though they might get mad at first and dig at the litter for a while >.<"" )"
4,Good for small or medium rabbits,"The litter pan is exactly what I expected, so I have no official complaint; however, my large rabbit hops all the way in and pees over the edge. My problem is not cured as I had dreamt. On the other hand, I use high-back pans for four smaller rabbits, and this style has cured a world of headaches for me."
3,Our ferrets don't like it that much,Our ferrets don't really like to go in this since they can't back into a corner and get their whole body in the pan. You're better off going with a smaller corner pan or a small cat pan. It's also very large and tall. Not worth the money when you can go out to walmart and get a cat litter pan for really cheap that takes up about the same amount of space.
2,remote alarm?????,I bought this item for two of my best friends and when they opened it I was embarrased....The Remote does absolutly NOTHING.....<br />THE ALARM IS SO QUIET IT WOULD PUT YOU TO SLEEP NOT WAKE YOU...<br />VERY DISAPOINTED
4,Reply to other poster,"The reason you might need this is because the Gmini 400 does not come with the remote. The 400 is a great unit, but I will refrain from covering here since this is about the remote.The remote is great, but severely lacking in one feature: you can not turn the unit on with the remote. You can turn it off, but not on. This flaw keeps me from giving it the 5 stars it otherwise deserves. I hate having to fish my 400 out of my pocket just to power it up when the remote is handy.Other than that, the display is great, and the various knobs perform multiple functions, giving you a ton of control. I also like the layout and the varying feel of the different functions, which allows me to DJ without looking at the unit.It works for several Archos models and there is a manual for the remote downloadable from Archos' website. It is a great read if you are on the fence about purchasing this accessory."
3,Its OK . . .,"I think its still worth buying, but there's only one line. The thing shows only one line. The song name doesn't scroll, there's not timing information on the current playing media, and the controls can be difficult. Its still worth the convenience of leaving the player in your bag. And the lighted buttons are cool."
3,Nice addition to the Archos AV400,"It's a nice addition that you may use some of the time. I bought this a few years back after buying my AV420 that did not come with it. The remote works pretty well, once you get used to the non-straightforward control scheme. If you already have the AV400 and use it regularly, this might be a good buy. I give it three stars based on the controls and ease of use."
2,Not What I expected.,For some reason I thought this book was a history of the Silk Road.Written like in aa history book. Much of it involves informationfor tourists; where to stay and eat along the route. Each page isdevoted to a seperate city or kingdom. Almost impossible to followif you wanted a history of the Silk Road. There are other books aboutthe Road I am sure that are much better.
3,More than a bit contrived and overdone,"The best part of the book is its basic plot: a group of ""outed"" gay ML baseball players become a winning team, under the direction of a crusty, bigoted ""old school"" owner-manager. The normal development from that could not help but make for an entertaining and enjoyable book.But the author goes too far ... including distracting side stories about a down-on-his-luck sports writer, religious leaders' takes on homosexuality, and a cheesey local cable TV operator who makes his daughter the team's TV commentator in order to keep her busy. I wasn't expecting (nor did I desire) any ""PC"" approach to gays, but the author ran with the classic stereotypes to the point where many of the non-gay characters are laughably clueless ... A lot less would have been a lot more, in my opinion."
1,mediocre denouement,"While the premise of this very high-concept debut novel is indeed clever, the payoff is lacking. The baseball background lacks depth and believabilty, and the preciousness of the writing begins to wear on the reader, as one approachs the mediocre denouement."
2,Not feeling this one,"I'm quite disappointed by this Popol Vuh release. Now, I should admit that they are not one of my favorite Krautrock bands, as too much of their output sounds like wishy-washy New Age music to me.And yes, to my ears, this is more of the same. A lot of reviewers have called this one of Popol Vuh's ""harder"" albums, but that's a bit of an overstatement. Maybe it's got more of a rock beat throughout, but it's far from being hard. Too much of this album sounds like soft, half-baked, 1970's, hippy-dippy noodling to me.Musically unchallenging and unadventurous, it almost sounds like it should be the soundtrack to a 1970's California soft-porn movie...Or maybe it should be accompanying a reading of some Rod McKuen poems?I say avoid this one, unless you're a completist or actually like New Age music."

3,Puppy Doesn't Like It,Kong makes a great product. My puppy just does not like the Kong. This is the second dog I've had that is not into it. Puppy ignores Kong for the most part even when there are treats inside.
3,Comment my purchase,"The service was very good, the product does not arrive with the requested color.The product was excellent, and was sent on the date specified, and their arrival was equally efficient."
2,A nice set but not recommended,"It is nice for the very cheap price. But some pieces could arrive broken.It has poor protection. I bought 2 sets and received 1 with 5 broken pieces.is it an accident? May be, but definitly I hope a replacement from the seller. (july 7 )But now many weeks later I have not received a replacement for broken pieces.definitly I cannot recomend this purchase. ( july 29 )"
3,quality isn't up to par,"its the top of the game and the whole box that I don't like. cheap quality, may need to be redone in future. doesn't close/snap together, so pieces will likely fall out when opening it or moving it. The pieces are neat though.The shopping experience was fast."
3,Unoriginal and overrated CD,"When I purchased this CD, I was looking forward to original music and original content in the enhanced portion. I ended up being sorely disappointed. This CD features only four tracks: the album version of Shoebox, the radio edit of Shoebox, a new version of If I Had $1000000, and Trust Me. ""Trust Me"" is the gem of this CD, and without it, this CD would get two fewer stars. Both versions of ""Shoebox"" can be found elsewhere - the album version on ""Born on a Pirate Ship"" and the radio edit on the ""Friends"" soundtrack. .... As to the enhanced portion of the CD - it is exactly the same as the enhanced portion on ""Born on a Pirate Ship."" I would not recommend this to anyone who isn't a diehard BNL fan...."
2,WARNING - WARNING - WARNING!,"Please do not allow yourself to be deceived! Johannes Greber and his wife consulted the spirit world (a/k/a Satan's demons) for help with understanding and rewording the HOLY scriptures. NEVER should we consult mediums who divine spirits as warned in the Bible. (Leviticus 20:27 and 1 Timothy 4:1 - KJV)The Holy Spirit is the only spirit who can teach us the truths within the Bible. (John 14:26 - KJV)Readers, BEWARE the contents of this book!"
5,Great country album and artist,"This album is wonderful. Paul Brandt has a winner with this, his debut album. Not only does he have a great voice, but he also wrote or co-wrote 6 of the songs on this album. Paul used to be a nurse in Calgary Alberta, so what a change in careers for him this is. But with the talent displayed on this album, I think he has found his niche. ""I Do"" which he wrote for his wife is one of the most romantic songs ever. Perfect for a wedding, as other reviewers have stated. Recommended!"
4,Surprisingly Good Album,"This album wasn't as popular as it could have been. With good ballads and a little twang as well, it had enough balance to climb higher in the charts. But, if you're looking for an album that has some mellow tracks to sip a beer to, while adding a little change of pace with the more ""twangy"" tracks... this might be one you stick into your CD player. ""I Do"" is a nice romantic ballad, as is ""On The Inside"", and ""I Meant To Do That"" is a mellow track with a bit of a sad twist. ""My Heart Has A History"" is a catchy tune as well, hitting the charts back then."
3,coffee warmer,It works and is fine but there are others out there that shut off when the item is lifted off for a few minuets. I often leave it on and worry about it.
4,Biology Book,Book was received in the order presented. Could not find this book anywhere. Thank you so much. I am sure my son will be happy with it.
5,We deserve an explanation!!!!!,"Why have you, Amazon.com, not printed an explanation as to the doubled pricing of this book? Your silence pertaining to this previously asked question, makes many, with good reason, wonder exactly what type of ""business"" you run. You owe us all, your paying customers, a response for this blatant price gauge!"
5,No Problems,"This is one of three external enclosures (all different brands) that I have had for over a year and it is still working fine. It is used mainly for backup so it does not run for more than a few hours at a time so I can't testify that heat would not be problem (there is no fan). The enclosure does have an power button and led light. Somehow I managed to break the plastic stand and had to repair it. But overall, the unit has performed as advertised and I would buy another one if needed for an IDE drive."
2,Blah.,"Lost in translation. I have read some challenging books in my time but I think this one takes the cake. I found it lacking in just about every area. The book started out very slow and I had high hopes that it would get better quickly because of the size of the book. Unfortunately it never got there for me. I want to attribute it to the fact that it is set in another country very far from here (America) and because the culture gap is so vast, I just couldn't understand where the author wanted this story to go.Supposedly Oyone and Sosuke were very much in love with each other. I never felt it. The story was all over the place and the ended didn't make any sense to me at all. It felt like another book all together. I never felt like the book even had a resolve at the end. It just - ended."
1,A Huge Disappointment!!,"I was very disappointed in this book. I've read a few other of Soseki's novels and absolutely LOVED them, but just couldn't get into this one at all and didn't appreciate the story line either. I will leave you with the synposis from the back of the book.""A central masterpiece of twentieth-century Japanese literature, THE GATE describes the world of the humble clerk Sosuke and his wife Oyone, living in quiet obscurity in a house at the bottom of a cliff. Childless, the couple find themselves having to takeresponsibility for Sosuke's younger brother. Oyone's health begins to fail, and news that Oyone's ex-husband will be visiting near by promotes a sense of crisis in Sosuke and forces him to abandon his life of quiet domesticity."
1,Sony under cabinet is worst radio cd player ever,"My old Sony desktop sound system died and I replaced it with this under counter Sony. What a mistake!!! The radio sound is terrible and wavers. CDs sound terrible and beautiful sounding music is so distorted that listening is painful. I called Sony and they told me, Tough. I have a new opinion of Sony,,,,nevermore!!!!!!!"
3,Decent Value,"Pluses - mounts easily, three-CD changer, functions well, includes a remote, has decent sound for a small, inexpensive unit. Cons - poor AM and FM radio reception in an area behind a hill from distant transmitters."
3,SOUND STATIC REVIEW,"RETURNED ITEM. THERE WAS STATIC AT DIFERENT LEVELS WHEREVER I PLACED IT. IN ORDER TO AVOID STATIC, DIRECTIONS SAID TO ROTATE RADIO. BUT THEN I COULD NOT PROPERLY PLACE IT UNDER THE CABINET."
4,"So far, so good","We've had this CD player for over a month now. Installation took about 30 minutes. Sound is good, everything you'd expect from a Sony."
5,Excellent purchase,"We had previously purchased an under-the-cabinet radio/cd player but the first week the cd door wouldn't open. I thought I had broken it, but after reading other reviews of the same model, I found out that it was a defect and I didn't break it. I researched other brands, and found better reviews of this model. It has been a good purchase. We get many more channels on the radio and the cd player has not had any problems opening. The sound is excellent and we are very happy with it."
4,Solid product,"I bought this player for my wife for Christmas 2009. Everything has worked perfectly so far, but I have been sure to save my receipt and box because of previous reviews. Sound quality is better than expected, and mounting was a breeze. One tip: Instead of using the paper drilling template included, I put an ink pad on each mounting post. Then I pressed the unit into place. The posts left nice little ink circles showing me exactly where to drill the holes.Overall, this is a great unit. I was wary about the reception since the antenna is in the power cord only, but I was pleased to find that it picks up every station in our area 100% clear. AND it's mounted in an interior room in the house."
3,Thank you santa,"Unfortunately, this case does not fit under my kitchen cabinets. Works fine, sounds fine, but For some reason (I can only guess because my house is old) the depth of the machine is more than the depth of my cabints. So, it actually ADDs to counter clutter. Oh well. at least I got tunes to cook and clean by.."
5,Sony Undercabinet Clock Radio/CD/MP3 Player,"This was a gift and it was very well received by the recipient as well as the rest of the family. This was a pleasant addition to our kitchen. Our kitchen is the heart of the house and we spend lots of time together cooking, creating, etc. To have Holiday Music and various other music in our kitchen is wonderful and we cannot understand why we waited so long to get one of these. Some family members had been asking for one of these for many years. There has not been one day that has gone by where we have not had the Radio/CD/MP3 player going while we create. We are very pleased."
4,Love it....but....,"I received this radio/cd player from my husband for Christmas. I absolutely love it except for one thing. There is NO battery backup. So, every time the power goes out (even for a few seconds), I lose the clock setting and all of my presets. I'm not sure why Sony didn't add a battery backup to alleviate this problem. Resetting all my presets every time is a little irritating.Other than that, I love it. The sound quality is great. It's nice having a cd player that holds 3 CDs as well as being able to connect an mp3 player. I also use the timer all of the time while I am cooking....very convenient!"
2,cd changer,the cd track changer don't work you can't go from one track to another with the remote or manualey
3,Sony Under Cabinet CD Changer,The quality of the radio is a little tinny which is the nature of the beast. In any case I am enjoying my player and I like the idea that I can listen to CDs/morning news while I am in the kitchen. It was very easy to install as well.
2,"OK, but wouldn't buy it again","Pros: 3CD changer, Aux Input for MP3Cons: no input for external antenna, no battery backupI use this radio mostly in the morning or in the evening when I'm in the kitchen, mainly to listen to the news. When reception is good, I really like this radio. On days when reception is bad, I hate this radio with a passion. If I could do it over again, I'd get a different radio that has external antenna input for both AM and FM, as well as battery backup for power outages so I don't have to reprogram everything again and again and again. (and yet again...)I rarely use the CD player or MP3 input because the speakers on this unit aren't really built for serious music listening. But I'm glad to have those options because when the radio reception gets bad (which it often does) I have some music to distract me from being utterly annoyed by the product designer."
4,Another great Sony product!!!,"I did a lot of research and finally decided on this unit. The installation was really easy, the three disc changer works flawlessly. I love the aux input. I play my ipod on it or connect it to my laptop and play either my itunes or stream from the internet.Great sound quality for such a small unit. I love the remote with strong magnet for the fridge. I like being able to shuffle songs b/t all three discs.The only downfall is the Aux cable. It is about 6 inches long so I had to go out and spend $25 for a longer one. If you plan on just using a small mp3 player then the 6 inch one is perfect.I would definitely purchase again."
4,under the counter cd player,"Great CD Player, easy to install. Has great sound and the fact that it is a 3CD changer is a bonus. It also players you IPOD which is awesome. I love it"
4,No tone control,"I've had this for less than a year, but use it daily. It's a great solution for sounds in the kitchen. The CD player works great, the tuner is great, the sound...I'd give it five stars but for the fact that there's no way to adjust the tone. Add treble control and it's a five star device."
3,Everything worked but.......................,"I gave this as a gift and when they put it up and plugged it in, the CD door would not open. They contacted Sony and arranged for a replacement after trying everything the help desk suggested. Lets hope the replacement works, cause they really liked everything else about the radio."
2,"CD player broken, rest worked fine but so what.","CD's won't play. Tried troubleshooting tips and got one to play, once. Unit just keeps cycling through the cd's and never plays them. I have brand new cd's in the unit. Radio is great. Sound is good for a unit like this. Installation was easy. Looks very nice. I am returning it and may give it another try because I like the idea of the ipod attachment and the sound was good."
1,Nice Unit...Lasted 6 Months Though,Searched reviews on this unit before I bought it. Mounted it under our cupboard and fit perfectly. Very happy with the unit for 6 months until it gave up the ghost on us. Unit was used maybe twice a week for the radio primarily at breakfast time. Power is on at the unit but can't use any functions. Radio and CD are inop and clock won't appear. Now that I have the holes drilled for this unit I'd love to not have to drill more for a different unit but I'm more than a bit leary. Maybe I got the bad one.
1,Christmas dissapointment,I purchased this unit for my wife for Christmas. Drilled the holes in my cabinet and installed the unit. The cd player did not function. I called Sony and spent an hour on the phone. After trying several CD's and powering the unit off. They said to wait an hour with the tray open to see if there was any condensation. I did with the same result. I was glad we opened this gift on 12/24. If we had waited till the 25th it would have been outside the 30 day replacement warranty. Another Chinese product.... quality is not a goal in their products.
1,Junk,This unit is junk. The CD player quit working after the second day. It's especially bad since this was a Christmas present. This is my second Sony product to have a malfunctioning CD player. What happened to Sony's quality???
3,Ok item - sound leaves a little to be desired,"Saw some good reviews of thes product on Amazon. Bought this item as space is at a premium in our house. The under the counter installation is neat. Requires holes to go thru the cabinet. Make sure that the cabinet is large enough to get a drill in.Even at max, the sound is not loud. you will listen to the radio when in the kitchen and maybe when you get to the family room. When you walk 2 rooms away, no such luck.All in all, an OK purchase. Nothing great."
1,Sony Clock Radio is junk,I have purchased a FM/AM 3 CD Kitchen Clock Radio in September 2007 for my wife. After a few months the CD player stopped functioning properly. It skips the tracks and plays intermittently. As well the sound quality is not good at all in comparison with even a CD player that was made 10 years ago.There has not been a provision from Sony to place couple of batteries to save the settings when power goes out in the house. You loose all the radio settings as soon as you loose power.This is very disappointing since we have paid almost $159 plus tax for it. Please avoid purchasing this product by all means.
2,Poor radio reception,"I returned this item after I found out that the radio part is not as good as I wished. Now, it could be where my house is located. I have also noticed that the sound from the radio was not crisp."
2,Cool in AZ,"Use the Sony Under the Cabinet Kitchen Clock Radio on a daily basis.The fact that it came with a 3 slot CD changer at a reasonable costwas the reason we purchased it. However, we found that the sound is notgreat and would only give this product a 2 out of 5. (5 being the best)."
5,Very Pleased,Bought this for my work out space over garage. It has worked well. I like that it has a 3 disc CD changer and input for MP3 player. The purchase was easy and came quickly packaged well.
4,Title,I'm pleased with this product. It was an easy install and looks good. The only thing is that it doesn't get all the radio stations that we listen to.
3,good AM signal in small town with huge AM station that overpowers the others.,"good?AM strengthTimer function for bakingSturdy after its installedBass Booster is OKbad?install instructions a bit vague as to radio placement under counter, had to re-drill holee.clunky pre-sets, not that easy to set or use.sound quality not as good as I expected, tinny? even with the bass booster.no battery back-up if it comes unplugged."
5,sony radio,We are enjoying the Sony radio. Good quality at a fair price. Nice sound and very practical. Has an MP3 jack and remote control. Very satisfied with this product.
5,"Great Product, and Great Price! Refurbished was the way to go!","This under-cabinet CD/Radio/iPod player is fabulous! I bought the refurbished unit, and it arrived in perfect condition... not to mention cost half the price! Installation was a snap with the provided paper template. The handy remote uses a magnet to stick to the fridge, and the unit comes with axillary input cable. The radio gets great reception, and the bass boost is nice, but makes the sound slightly garbled at high volumes. Without bass boost the sound is crystal clear. The display clock is easy to set, and buttons are user friendly. I would recommend this product to anyone, especially refurbished. Why not save the extra money?!"
3,Sony Radio,The instilation was simple. I enjoy the sound. This radio should have a battery back up. We louse our power quite often and re progaming is a bother.
1,CD Player Frequently Freezes Up!,The CD player freezes up and skips to song 2 when I attempt to play the cd.
4,Handy in the kitchen BUTTTT!!!!,"Nice look...easy install...great sound....overall a nice unit.... only two (2) flaws...1. The A.M. radio reception is terrible. Suggestion - add a remote antenna to the unit as an option.. 2. The radio needs a battery back up to retain the memory settings when the power goes out 20 presets for an almost elderly person (over 50) tkes a portion of my precious time and the wife needs me at the stove not the radio ..Oh well in America today NOT Much (if any) is a 100% anymore and guess what....... THERE WERE ""GOOD OLD DAYS"" sorry to say that young people today have nothing to reference REAL quality products to anymore Sony don;t throw in the towel yet another 50 years and maybe just maybe"
2,Too Nerdy,"I give one star to the author for his anecdotes about Rose Maddox's colorful mother and another star for his descriptions of the hootenannys where the Maddox family performed. But the rest of the book is too gossipy. And the prose style is too nerdy. Is this book about country & western music or ain't it ?Who cares if Johnny Cash made a pass at Rose when they were both young and obscure ? We've heard so many times on Larry King Live about Mr. Cash's pharmaceutical drug problem and we've seen the poster in which he gives the finger to music industry executives. But we never hear about him lusting after another woman besides June Carter, daughter of Maybelle Carter. Let's keep it that way. If the author wants to smear people, why isn't he straightforward about it ? He could start a new version of the National Enquirer based in Nashville."
1,A poor choice among volumes of this type.,"A labor of love such as this ordinarily should be cause of rejoicing. However, those wishing to explore the fine world of classical music can find many other titles better-written, with deeper perspective and wisdom. The writing is often clumsy, and contradictory. The performance choices--the book's heart--are poorly thought out, and reflect personal considerations which will not serve the purchaser of either the book or the recommended music. The lifetime listening program appended to the end of the book contains puzzling omissions, even given the limitations of space. Also, more surprising since the book has two authors, are the occasional garbled syntax and vague, pointless phrases. There are too many competitive titles in print to justify time spent with this volume"
4,My sons want this one all the time!,"This Liberian story immediatly became one of the top 5 favourites of my sons (ages 3 and 5). Though short, it is a very funny, warm-hearted story about how the main body parts - head, body, legs and arms - met and decided to join together as one body.The story is of course a metaphor for the benefits of working together, and unity.The only drawback is that it is short - I would rather have bought a book with three stories like this. This is often the case with children's books - you get only one short story per book, which makes little sense, other than to maximize profit for the publisher and the authors."
2,Not as bad as the prior makes ot seem.,"This tribute was not the best tribute I've ever heard. It was not completely horrible, excluding the vocals. The vocals were done completely and utterly wrong. They sounded like Bug Funny Foundation gone wrong. It was, however, interesting to hear a electronic interpretation of Disturbed. But, if they made a tribte for Believe I wouldn't waste my time. If you want tributes, look for ""Electro-Industrial tribute to Korn, Tribute to SOAD, The Third Eye String tribute to Tool, ect."" same genre of music, just much better tributes."
1,Bunch of BS,this is jus like the trib to Linkin Park... same guys tryin to karioke to it. theyre probly in their parents basement or somethinits so utterly stupid and does not deserve their name on itavoid Big Eye Records!
1,Bathroom Concert,"What is this??? You can hear the echo of the shower in the background. Man! This was recorded in a bathroom, not a studio....hell, not even in a garage. What were these guys thinking? This is the biggest disappointment that the music industry has ever witnessed. These guys should really get another job because they really can't sing!!!! I love Disturbed and this music is just a huge disgrace to them ALL!!!"
4,I like these tights!,"I've been really happy with the durability of these tights. I've worn them at least 20 times and they haven't snagged or run at all. They've also been through the washer and dryer several times and look ""good as new."" They make your bottom look great in tight pants, even pants made of thin material, and they destroy panty lines. However, I wish they were a bit less expensive."
3,Completely Overpriced,"I have tried numerous control garments,shapers, etc.. so I was very interested to see what all the hoopla was about.I am quite disappointed..Dont get me wrong, its a decent product, but nothing about it justifies the price. We're talking about a nice quality brand of control top hosiery here folks.. nothing more. Keep in mind that I'm not commenting on any other Spanx products, just utility of paying so much for this particular style (long ones in the picture) which look and feel no different to wearing control top panythose under my pants or long skirt."
4,WoW,"Thank you for your spanx tights. I wasn't sure about the size and I didn't try them on yet. Your service was fast.Thanx For the Spanx,Brenny"
4,We like Ollie,"My 2-year-old son seems to really like owls, and it was one of his first words so I bought this for him for Christmas. It's a nice size for a small child and very soft. I liked the leather feat and beak since it seemed maybe more realistic. He fell asleep just today cuddling him. I would definitely recommend this toy.P.S. My mom accidentally bought him a second owl from Build-A-Bear Workshop. I think I like this one better since my son is still so small, and also this one looks more real. That one is nice too though and it washed really nicely when he had a ""bath""."
1,horrlible all around,first of all the product didnt get to me for almost a month...after i had replied twice to the sender with no feed back..and than the item that i recieved wasnt anything like what was advertised in the picture...if your gonna show something...i thing you should atleast give what you show...horrlble service on this item...
4,Very Beautiful Piece,"I bought this beautiful teapot to match my other Royal Albert tea sets. Too bad it did not come with its own box. I am very disappointed when it arrived in broken pieces. Yes, there is bubble wrap around the teapot but the lid was inside the teapot without any bubble wrap. The shipping box did not has ""Handle with Care"" label on it. I had called the customer service to get a replacement. Hope this time it will arrive safely."
3,It would be better if the All-American chauvinism was cut off,"It is a cross between Star Trek, The West Wing and Commander in Chief. Very interesting, light story. As long as you ignore its annoying faults: The presidential staff never loses a battle, which is highly improbable. (They also seem to be permanently on the verge of a nervous breakdown.) Also, I would advise the author to travel abroad, in order to loose her All-American crap: It is amazing senior staff members of the Federation Council living in Paris have never ever heard about Germany (!), but they know about some obscure 20th. Century baseball player. It is also pathetic that the President regards a stupid baseball match as more important than the lives of the Federation citizens, considering that even now this sport is simply ignored outside the USA. This is boring. Fortunately, the good parts of the book are really good."
5,beanie,"a good product,it keeps my head and ears warm,and i like the camo pattern ,the guys i work with , are asking me where i got it,if i take it off,and put it down ,i will never find it again ,it arrived just before the cold snap hit us here,and so was well received,i can reccomend,this product."
2,Beanie,This thing is very tight on your head and they send you a plain camoflauge beanie rather than the color you are shown.
2,The cats fell off,These earings are very pretty but the cats break off very easily and mine are already broken
2,not enjoyable,"Before I even got this book, I had already read several of his novels and enjoyed each one immensely. However, I found this book difficult to read...There were not many places where I could stop and while reading I was wondering what the purpose was and my mind kept wandering..Finally, when I reached the end of the book I was disappointed that it ended that way. If this was the first novel I had read by John Farris, I might have shunned his other novels(glad I hadn't)I got rid of it after I finished reading it."
2,Far from his best material,"Rodney hasnt released a great album here. His first bunch of albums are his funniest, but he has slipped from a comical genious with creative comebacks and insults to his hecklers, to just spitting out a few dull ""mom"" jokes. Not much of this album I found real funny, unlike his earlier albums that had me rolling around on the floor trying to catch my breath. But with this one, I shouldnt have held my breath waiting for it. It's a pretty disapointing album, probably the worst one he has released so far."
5,"nice bag for 12"" powerbook","This bag fits the 12"" powerbook just right. My powerbook is a bit slippery and the MacCase is quite handy for carrying it around work and to work when you don't have much else to carry. There is room for the power adapter, cell phone, etc..."
5,love love love,"used to own the cassette. have been searching for cd at stores, could not find, even my daughter has been looking, she loved this cassette at the age of 8. we now own the cd, totally recommend, mr. sample is fabulous in concert, obviously recorded music of his is a hit."
5,Excellent music from beginning to end!,"This album could have been titled ""Old Places, Old Faces,Suite"" It is the most cohesive collection of compositionsI have heard from a recording artist in a long time.Read the liner note descriptions of each tune, it is Joe'sinspiration for every selection, and a diary of the mostsignificant impressions in his life. His reflections makeeach piece even more meaningful and interesting. The tracksare tight and his signature style is in top form! A must have!!"
1,Not at all 'fantastic',"We have purchased and enjoyed many products by Alex. This one was a real disappointment. The box basically comes with flour and salt and a little contraption to mix it and make playdough. The handle is not so easy to turn and the 'ball of clay' it makes is so tiny even my 2 yr old said, ""I need more!"" And it was messier than just putting flour and salt with water in a bowl and making a large quantity of playdough, which we ended up doing. My boys found that much more enjoyable. There are some small plastic tools and a small wooden rolling pin, but if you have any playdough toys already, a mixing bowl, flour and salt, you really don't need this box."
3,game control,"I bought this for my 9 year old grandson and he loves it all except this game was listed as new and it had no cover on the back to cover the batteries and it was to screw on but we made a back and the game plays fine but I was alittle mad about the write up as it said new and new is to have everything,no missing parts."
2,China goofed on this product,"This product is very poorly made.One chime quit working after several test rings;one wire had a cold solder joint and popped off. The bracket for the 12volt battery will barely hold it in place.C.E Steele Columbia, SC"
3,Good For a Short time,"Gave as a gift, worked great for a few months, and thanwould not work.Installed new batteries, still did not work????"
2,1 out of 2,"At first use this was a great buy. After a few months, one of the chimes would not operate anymore.I changed the batteries and got it to work by the test button, but the remote would not trigger the second one any longer. I did not return it. I thought as long as one still working, why go through the hassle of paying postage for the other one."
1,false advertised,"I recently purchased this wireless doorbell mainly because the ad stated it had a range of 450ft.and 2 chimes. The shipping packaging was taped to the product packaging so, removal was impossible without damaging the original wrapper. I had a very troublesometime getting the system to work. Come to find out through trial and error, one of the chimes only has a range of about 3-4ft. and the other chime's range is only about 75ft.(not even close to the 450ft. that was advertised). when I made an effort to return this Item,I come to find out that between the original S&H charges,the cost to insure and ship back to the seller, will end up costing me more than I paid for the unit itself.I now am the owner of a doorbell that is totally worthless to me!!!"
1,free shipping makes it good - UPDATED,"for $19.95 & free shipping it's a good door bell. I have had this door for about 3 mos., it's load & has a nice light show when rang. BUT IT'S FROM CHINA & IT'S CHEAPLY MADE! If you could find it in a store, i think it would cost about $9.99+ tax. If you pay more than $20 for this door bell you are paying to much. it's a nice cheap door bell. At $20 i would have given it a 4 or maybe a 5, but at almost $30 with shipping i call it a rip off!here is something i have just found out, this doorbell & others made by the some company, that do the same thing sells for as little as $10 with shipping on ebay!i found about 6 or 7 diffent ones highest one was $16 with shipping. look under ""wireless doorbell 1 remote 2 chimes"" on ebay & i thought $20 was a good price! i got 2 more of them from ebay for my friends & they work just like this one. talk about a rip off! ARE TIMES THAT HARD?"
3,Not quite ready for prime-time,"Well, there's good news and bad news. First the bad news - they didn't find their groove on these sessions - they're kinda stiff. The good news - they didn't stop practicing. There's still hope for all of us frustrated musicians. The first Santana album (with the lion cover) is almost the same line-up, some of the same songs, and from the same time period, but what a difference. For early work, I prefer ""Live at the Fillmore 1968 [LIVE]""; a year earlier, a few different musicians, but performing live seems to have loosened them up. BTW, what ever happened to Dave Brown (bass)? He laid a great foundation."

1,THIS POS IS SPAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,First you have to install the spam portion of Mcafee PORTION that is nothing BUT SPAM ITSELF.....Then after your machine rewrites Eudora a couple of dozend times. Five reinstalls so that you can finally un-install this garbage.Hopefull you won't lose as much e-mail and time as I didAVOID THIS PRODUCT..MCAFFEE YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED...YOUR PRODUCT THREE YEARS AGO WAS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS TANKI probably will never get a refund after a 20 min long distance call I hung up!!!!
1,Does not work with Outlook,"Terrible product. The manual is confusing. Integration with Outlook is non-existing. For the life of me, I can't get this product to work as advertized. Do not buy this!"
1,AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!!!,"(Zero star rating if possible)If you have Outlook 2000, skip this product. It requires you have a MAPI e-mail account and not a POP3 account as most home computer users have. It seems to have a big history of crashes and unexplainable behavior. If you take the time to read the McAfee support board, you will see all the problems this product has.Avoid! Run away from this one! Burning your money would provide more value for you."
2,very secure but too bulky,"The quality of the wallet is fine, but I find it too bulky for my pockets. Zipper barely encloses the wallet, seems like the zipper might break first."
3,"Good, but a bit smaller","It's good in terms of quality, but the size could be a bit bigger to accomodate 5/6 Cards, Bills, Coins etc."
1,"Worked once, maybe twice","I got this tooth brush in a gift bag from a party i went to, and when i tried it out, It didn't work! It would play the music for about 10 seconds, then it would die, and i couldn't turn it back on! It went through the whole song maybe once or twice. The music is also terrible quality. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
2,Biblical and today's standards of living,"In my opinion: A book that tries to stand between being an academic one and a preaching. In fact it is much closer to the second. It has some traces of exegesis, but only to use them as a basis to proclaim the way we have to live as we wait for the second coming. A good book for someone who would like to compare the biblical principles and the today standards. Finally, the relevant town is called Thessaloniki until today, and not Salonica (p.13)."
2,The worst of the trilogy,"This is by far the worst of three ""The Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal"" books. Even so, it's good to get a great list of albums from the seventies.This is the worst, in my opinion, simply because Popoff's writing is at its most obnoxious ever. Incredible how the guy improved with the years. Almost each review here is a pain to read, the phrase construction is annoying, the words used so full of rubbish that readin a single entry is a real pain.Get it only for completist reasons. I bought it hoping it was as good as the ohter two, but I was terribly wrong."
2,Half of it is old stock footage,"I bought this for my daughter's first birthday, and I am deeply disappointed with it. Each episode is only 30 minutes rather than an hour, and there is barely 5 minutes of muppets. The rest is just cartoon shorts of the alefbet and old stock footage, including scenes from some random bar mitzvah. Not worth the price. Get your muppet fix from PBS, and rely on yourself and your community to teach your child Jewish values."
3,Our puppy loved this toy,I've never had a dog before and when we met with a trainer she suggested getting a Kong for her. I got this thinking that with the rope - it would be the perfect toy. Our puppy loved it. Thought it was great. But she really only liked the rope part of it. I tried putting different soft foods (peanut butter really) in the crevices -- but that never really took. It was a pain to clean out the dried peanut butter. But she kept on playing with the rope. It was a fun toy to take outside in the yard with her.I would recommend the classic Kong if you're looking for something to hide treats in for your dog. This is great if you're looking for a great chew / rope toy.
2,Rope not so durable,"If you have a heavy chewer, this is not the toy to get. Unfortunately, within a day, my 45lb. aussie had the rope completely chewed through!"
3,rope chewed off in no time,WE have several Kong toys for our dog. He chewed the rope off this one right away. He still plays with the rubber part a year later. Just okay as dog toys go.
1,In shreds within minutes!,"Dental Kong with rope is certainly not for strong chewers. The rope was in shreds and parts of it were even ingested by my 15-lb terrier in a matter of minutes. The middle rubber piece is strong and can hold up to the most avid chewers, but I definitely would not recommend the rope. In my opinion, it's better just to buy the regular kong."
2,Not that great,"This toy bought for my 17 month old ""chew through everything"" English Springer Spaniel. She liked chewing on the rope until I had strings all over my carpet - which by the way are hard to see and get wound around the vacuum wheels. Within about 2 days one rope was chewed through and then she lost interest. I eventually cut away both ropes but she still had no interest in the rubber KONG section - totally wasted money on my dog. Maybe other dogs will like these but they smell like rubber and that could be the ""put-off"" for my dog. I do not recommend."
2,"""Toy"" fell off almost immediately",This product did not hold up within one day of play with my new puppy. The red rubber toy came off almost immediately and is now missing somewhere in the house.
4,Great Tug Toy,"This is a great tug toy, my dog gets very excited every time I pull this one out of the closet. She doesn't like to grab the Kong as much as the rope itself but either way she had great time with it. The only drawback is the clean up, the rope breaks during tug game so it is hard to clean up if you play it on carpet like we do... I have to vacuum almost every time we play tug with this. But overall good toy, dogs love it."
2,not worth it,"I don't understand the point of this toy. It doesn't seem to clean my dog's teeth at all. I even tried to put dog toothpaste on the rope or inside the kong part, but it ends up getting kind of moldy and gross. It's fine as a general pull toy but that's not how it was advertised. You're better off just getting a strong pull toy and some enzymatic dog toothpaste or bones. My dog usually loves Kong toys but he ignores this one and it's too much work for me to keep clean to use as advertised. Maybe puppies would like to chew on it?"
3,Read With Caution,"Supernature comes up with some amazing observations and facts. However, although Watson is clearly trying to be objective and uses a variety of sources, some (and only some) of his sources are extremely questionable. For example, the most amazing claims on the subject of ESP, telepathy etc can all be traced to a book ""Psychic Experiments behind the Iron Curtain"". This is a fascinating book and a good read on top of it, but do check out the footnotes before converting."
1,DO NOT BUY ! ! !,"I have had Bissell cleaners for years and when I read about the Pro Heat2 with an on-board heater I thought that was a great feature...Well I bought one last October and that very 1st day I got 1/2 of the family room done and it stopped working. I called the store in which I bought it and of course they said I could return it - so I did and just got another one. I have used it approx 4 times over this year and it has stopped completely. If I really think back I think I had issues each time I used it with either how much water was dispensed or how little water it picked back up... When I called Bissell they gave a repair shop to call as it is still under warranty - - the repair shop told me they had 12 sitting in their shop right now for repair - - that was not a good thing to hear.. I have always had a steam cleaner since I have been married and consider it a must have appliance, especially if you have kids and animals...Save youself alot of head-aches and do not buy this cleaner..."
1,cyber threat ncis:la,"out of the two episodes I bought of NCIS:LA this one would not play correctly. I have had that happen only once before (Machine Gun Minister), and it was blamed on my internet connect. Unfortunately, that is not what I have come to find out. For I have watched many of the programs that I have bought back to back and out of all of them this and another were the only two I encountered problems with. So no I could not rate this a success because of the reloading and reloading I have encountered all three times I tried to watch it. I have bought two seasons all have worked fine, then two episodes and only one works fine. Two movies and only one worked fine too. So I am not happy with those two instances. I have tried to play the NCIS:LA Episode three times each time with the same results. So in some instances I think the streaming is very erratic. I do not have this problem when watching Netflix."
2,Why so violent,There is just a lot of shooting of guns and killing for no apparent reason. This series is too violent with little or no story.
1,Damaged.. Just like all the DVDs I order from Amazon,This is at least the 11th or 12th DVD I've ordered that has arrived with a scratch or embedded damage. The contents are awesome; just wish the physical media was up to parr. Note to self... Hit and miss at a real store is a lot better than Amazon.
3,"It's okay,","It's okay nothing special. I am not really a fan of this show, to be honest I mainly ordered this episode to watch the end of the two part Hawaii five O cross over. It was imo the weaker half. I wanted to like it - I really did. I like LL Cool J I enjoy most of his acting work. (I give him mad love for Toys) but this show is boring and the character just don't have the charisma that the original series has."
5,NCIS: Los Angeles is so good with a great ending episode for the third season.,"The third season is another winner. Daniela Rua really shines as Kensi in this season especially in the two-part episode K Blye. The truth surrounding the death of Kensi's father comes out in these two episodes and it was refreshing to see Marty Deeks serious for once in trying to help Kensi cope. I see a faint stirring of romance between these two and I'm wondering how many seasons it will take for Kensi and Deeks to acknowledge what they feel for one another.I believe my favorite episode is Neighborhood Watch, where Marty and Kensi go undercover as a newlywed couple in a neighborhood, trying to discover a hidden spy cell. Funny and yet serious. I highly recommend this third season for all NCIS fans.Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J are great as well. These actors on this show are the best, especially Linda Hunt at Hetty."
3,I only got it for the Hawaii Five-0,"I'm a HUGE NCIS fan, but just cannot buy in to NCIS: LA. Not sure if its the acting or the ""missions"", it just doesn't seem fitting. I purchased the episoide when Hawaii Five-0 comes to the main land to catch a criminal. Great episode, just still can't get into the NCIS LA series"
2,NCIS: LA,Several of the DVD's won't play on our machines. They stall and won't continue no matter what we do. We know they are mass produced but quality should be better.
4,"""Very entertaining""","This show have a lot of action and the story line is great, and since i'm retired from the Military it is very entertaining."
5,great series,At the end of each season I await for the dvd to be released to rewatch any episode I have missed. Its great on cold days to watch
5,Great crossover,"I watch Hawaii 5-0, but did enjoy the crossover with the NCIS guys. I've always like LL & Chris in most of their shows."
4,entertaining series,"I like this show. The characters are interesting and there is a good dose of humor in their interactions. While the plots are often fairly far-fetched and the body count often absurdly high, it's just a fantasy with a somewhat lower eye-roll quotient than a lot of series TV. It's not Masterpiece Theater, it's an old fashioned shoot em up, car chase, good guys always shoot straight type of show. Like its ""parent"" show, NCIS, there is character development and the characters, themselves, have their flaws and quirks and strong relationships. My only complaint about the product is that the picture quality is not very good on the dvds."
2,DVD,"It was good, except the first DVD was cracked around the center hole. It still works, we just have to be careful when we take it out of the package."
3,Just don't sweat....,"Unfortunately, this is a white hat and living in AZ sweating is an absolute. So, a white hat gets sweat stains no matter what you do. And when a sports hat is DRY CLEAN ONLY!!! Whoever thought that was a good idea should be FIRED!"
3,People aren't just being picky!,"Overall, very pleased with these speakers. Great price, great looks.I was taken by suprise by the sound quality. I had read a number of reviews, many discussing how flat the mid-range is on these speakers. I assumed that there were some folks with very good ears who were being picky about this lower cost set of speakers. I am nothing close to an audiophile, but within the first few seconds, I knew exactly what everyone meant. The mid-range on these speakers is amazingly flat/absent. The sound quality from my cheaper, 10 year old Altec Lansings was far better. Even with a lot of equalizer tuning, it still doesn't sounds quite right.Take all the reviews seriously...the mid-range on these speakers is truly awful. If you're picky about your music, look elsewhere. If you want some good looking computer speakers, these'll work just fine."
3,"Very average product, and not all that loud","But I really only bought it for the sub, as I already have two near-field studio monitors.As a system, the output is pretty weak. As the other reviewer mentioned, there is a real lack of midrange. This is probably fine if all you listen to is hip-hop, but with any other style of music, it really suffers.Should also work fine for gamers, but it's not a surround system, so why bother?"
1,Not Good Quality,Just out of the box and the right speaker had distortion noises on certain notes/pitches of music.
4,great speakers,"the speakers work great. i love that the subwoofer isn't over powering. i just bought this one for my brother but i've had mine for about 3 yrs and i have had no problems with them at all. they still have a great sound and work perfectly fine. i hook up my computer, my xbox 360 and mp3 player to them all the time and works perfect."
4,Boom Boom goes the room,"I hooked this speaker set up quickly and easily. The computer accepted the new speakers without a problem as well. I have since tried this set up with music, movies, and general computer sounds, with each test the speakers continue to impress me. I have the settings low because its such a great sounding system. I turned it up initially and felt the floor rattle a little. So keep that in mind when buying this system, it has power. Enjoy it, because I am."
2,Not Dependable,I have had three of these sets now. The first set was defective right out of the box. I plugged it in and one of the speakers did not work. I was unable to get a refund so I exchanged it for another and I found that one of the speakers (for me it was the left) was significantly underpowered compared to the other so I had to modify my settings in Windows XP to where the left volume was higher than the right. Then the subwoofer went out after less than 2 days (and I only used them once for about an hour during that time) and had to go back and exchange it to get a third set. This last set I had lasted 3 months before the volume knob shorted out and the right speaker went out. Extremely disappointed in this product. It has been nothing but a problem for me and they actually sounded pretty good when they worked properly. It seems that others have faired better with their speakers but I say buy at your own risk and keep that receipt handy.
5,love these!,i love these speakers. wired remote control + bass knob on the remote control = perfect. it's a shame these were discontinued and replaced with a system w/o these killer features.
5,Amazing! Great sound!,"This sound system is a really good deal! Only 75 bucks and a heck of a lot of sound. Great for apartment, will make your parties boom."
4,"Overall, a pretty good deal.","I like the speakers, over all. Of course you can buy better, but the sound quality from these can certainly be called decent. Decent as in not the best, but if you can't afford the best, these will do. They don't sound bad, that's for sure. And paying $70 for them beats the living crap out of paying the $130 that Best Buy wanted. So the moral of the story is, buy online. And never buy from best buy."
4,good value,"I was shopping for something to plug my ipod into under $100. Nothing compares sound wise, nothing...I looked at everything out there. This is room filling sound with deep bass. Sure there are systems with better mid-range, but they ain't $70."
4,Worth the money,The Z4 speakers from Logitech are very much worth the price paid and work well for a variety of music. I really appreciate the volume and bass control paddle which has made it easier to dial in my preferred settings depending on the music and situation. There are still some songs that sound a little hollow but I've not had many where these speakers underperfromed.Overall a great value and am happy with the product.
4,Very Good PC Speakers,"After listening to these speakers for a couple of weeks, I can say I would purchase them again and recommend them to anyone who is looking to have adequate sound from their PC. These are not for very loud play. You are going to have to go over the 100 dollar range for that."
5,Great for the price,"Like others have said, what are people expecting for under a 100.00? Considering the cost, and size of the speakers, the sound was great. A very respectable bass sound, warm and musical, without being too boomy. (unless you get crazy with the bass control). I did hear a small hole in the crossover frequencies between the sub woofer and mid-range drivers, but it was not objectionable, in my opinion. If these were 200.00 or more, I would probably be bothered. Also, the bass/volume control remote is a handy feature. Especially the headphone output on it. The design is attractive, and the build quality was excellent for the price range. It is compact enough to fit nicely on (and under) my computer desk. I am very happy with the purchase, and recommend it to anyone who needs speakers for their computer, and even for listening to music (as a secondary music source.)"
2,Poor quality,Mine lasted about 6 months.First the rigth speaker stopped working. It seems the wiring inside the speaker got disconnected; I had to replace the speakers with another pair of altec lansing speakers.Just now about 1 yr after purchase the subwoffer gave up on the left channel. Time to throw this out...
4,Nice system but did come with a few tiny scratches..,"If you're looking for a legitimate and affordable speaker system, I highly recommend this product.However, my first order came with a couple hairline scratches. I got an exchange (amazon was very fast in delivering a replacement), but the new speakers also had a couple scratches. The scratches are tiny, barely visible, but I'm just the type of person to be bothered by this."
3,Cute boxes,"After reading the reviews I decided to go for it anyway. Most of the boxes came fine, but about two of them were not glued together well and at least another two had visible globs of glue I successfully removed off the exterior of the boxes. The inside looks kinda cheap, but to be hinest, it got the job done. I had bought some pearl earrings as gifts for the kid cousins and just needed a box to put them in. WOuld have preferred something nice, but again, it got the job done."
5,Hot,"Item came as described and on time. Like someone once said, the picture tells the story and, Oh, great design too!"
5,Like!,The Henna lasted longer than I thought and I like the designs. It was cost effective too when you don't want to pay high dollar for a quick look.
1,Horrible,It is an absolutely horrible book. Do not buy it. It has thirteen Henna tatooes. Do NOT BUY!
1,Not What I Expected,"I ordered this book thinking it would be an actual book containing henna tattoo designs, but this is more like 13 temporary tattoos that you can get from a quarter machine. I would consider spending a $1.50 for this at the store just for fun for a kids gift, but absolutely isn't worth spending the $1.99 sourcing fee and shipping and handling. If you are looking for some temporary tattoos you apply with water (which is what these are) you can find the same style of tattoos for much much cheaper at a dollar store or any retail store."
2,"Chemicals, NOT real henna","These fake tats are pretty, and I'd like to keep them, HOWEVER...they are misrepresented. I bought ""henna tattoos"", because I wanted something natural, made with henna. These are made of a long line of chemicals including PVA (Polyvinyl Acetate), Modified Varnish, Deodorized Petroleum and more yummies. I don't put crap like that on my body, so I'm returning them. I find it annoying that Amazon doesn't bother to list the ingredients and passes them off as ""henna"", something that people perceive as ""natural and safe""."
2,they suck,"they suck, they don't stay on. i have applied several temporary tattoos before but these are very low quality, they just don't adhere to skin as well as others. decent designs for only $1.50, but pointless to even buy in my opinion."
2,Attention grabbing title ..,"but I didn't get much out of this book. It seems to stray too often from the subject title. Also the book seems to be lacking in anything that might be considered a breakthrough in intellectual thinking and debate on the matter. It also seems a bit jumbled. For general reading on the subject I am not sure if I would recommend it, however if you are a researcher of academic type looking for information that you can quote you may just gleen something useful out of it."
1,Blackness without ethnicity,"This is my first experience with kindle books, however I have much difficulties accessing the material on my android tablet. Although, I was able to download it onto my laptop. Hopefully, I will find something good in my reading since this book is for a course that I am currently enrolled in. I have reported the issue to amazon, I would like at some point in time to access it from my reader after all the corrections have been made."
5,Best CF card around,"The review I read stated that you can only use the USB cable with the Lexar card. Well of course you can only use it with the Lexar card! It was never designed to be a general purpose card reader! I had one of the first 8X 80 meg cards that Lexar put up for sale. After about a year I got another 32 meg 8X card from Lexar. It was at that point that I discovered that my 80 meg card was really pretty slow. I wrote Lexar about my little problem. Lexar gave me a brand new 80 meg 8X USB enabled card for free! That is what I call great service. I now have four seperate Lexar cards. The only problem I have ever had was quickly resolved by Lexar. If one wants a general purpose card reader, they only cost about $40. In my opinion, Lexar cards are the best in the business."
2,very small stones,This set of earrings are very very small. not even worth the 30$ i spent on them. I gave them to a ten yr old. Not for an adult at all.
5,"The Tejhano choice of Camp Dwyer, Afghanistan",A very good choice for listening while out in the middle of Afgahnistan. I have yet to have heard any other sounds worth listning.
4,very special,"It is a very special music, one way is very simple other way fully melodic and romantic"
2,Not a beginner's book on Scotland,"This is not a beginner's book on Scotland. A reader must already be versed in the history of Scotland otherwise there are just a bunch of names and places being thrown around. And what would have really helped is a map...or several maps...If I grew up in Scotland and knew Scottish history, this would be a great book...but for me, someone trying to learn more about Scotland, not so much."
3,A Non-Historian tells the Story of Scotland,"I am addicted to history! The author admits that he is not a qualified historian and theirin lies my problem.I do believe that he sucessfull makes 'history'not so dull. My only complaint is that too often in his writings some of the more important connections and data are missing, and a novice could not connect the dots, and would miss a great deal! From all his previous efforts, and retoration of Scottish homes and other interests I still find his works to be a good read....and truly miss the fact that his writings have ceased."
5,It's good.,"I like it. It allows me to always have a nice little blade on me for whatever I might need it for (I'm always finding a good excuse to use it). The blade comes plenty sharp for the size of the knife. Don't expect to cut down any trees with this knife, but it'll get the small jobs done no problem."
5,Swiss Army Money Clip,This knife/money clip was exactly what I was looking for. I am still very satisfied with my purchase
5,money clip knife,Great knife and money clip. Had one previously but lost it. Missed it a lot and had to replace it.
2,NOT WORTH THE $$$!!!,"I got this game expecting it to be a good learning game but it is NOT! I wouldn't suggest this game because it really has no story line, is very, very confusing when racing, and if you choose to see the race, you have to be the jockey. There is no instruction manual to tell you how to be the jockey. You can also choose to sim the game, which I don't really get... Overall, this game is very confusing if you don't know how to do it or get bored very easily.I would suggest Saddle Club games, Let's Ride, and Pippa Funnell games. They have a good story line, some mysteries, and can keep you occupied for hours."
4,This Game was pretty good...,it kind of gets boring if you play it every day but it is fun if you take your laptop and play it on the plane i suggest Equestriad 2001
1,This is not a CD by THE DARKNESS,"If you are considering buying this and think that it is a single by The Darkness of ""Permission to Land"" fame, you are incorrect. Don't be fooled. This is Garbage. I hope this review is useful."
1,Too high a price for the quality,"While this is an interesting show, it's too expensive for the quality of the footage and the overall content."
5,music cd,"I'm very pleased with the product and with the delivery time. This item i have been looking for, for a long time, and was thrilled to find it at amazon. Good product, good service, good price. Another satisfied cutomer."
3,Just a man.,This Cd is made up of all cover songs that were recorded by Men. With Cher's low register it was a wise choice. The remix to One by one was a major club hit and gave her the idea to record a complete dance record. Believe.
3,The Gunman,"For those of you who enjoyed Cher's rendition of ""The Gunman"", you may want to check out Prefab Sprout's latest release ""The Gunman and Other Stories"". Paddy McAloon, the songwriter behind Prefab Sprout, wrote the song and offers a full 8-minute epic version on his album. This was apparently how Cher's version was originally supposed to sound but she claimed it was the ""weirdest ****ing song she'd ever heard"" and they pared it down considerably! Anyway, just a suggestion...""The Gunman and Other Stories"" has not been released in the States yet but it is available on www.amazon.co.uk."
4,Paradise is certainly here,"This isn't a ""standard"" rocky kind of album like we have had from Cher in the past but it is a magnifficent album all the same. Crammed full of sumptuouse soul songs as well as more poppy songs. Beautiful songs (the sun ain't gonna shine anymore, what about the moonlight) and evan more beatiful lyrics (we'l stumble together untill we learn to dance)This is an album no home should be without, you can never be board of playing it and can't help but sing along or dance to the ballads. BUY THIS ALBUM NOW. I GUARANTEE YOUR LIFE WILL BE BETTER!"
4,Maybe the best album she ever recoreded,"Knowing how poppy and trashy Cher could be, this album come as surprise - this is a work of a mature artist and if the lady herself wasn't excatly in the mood for singing (she DOES sound dissinterested sometimes) the producers work is really something to hear! Cher sounds very good, specially on the ballads (""I'm blowin' away"" and ""The Gunman"" are really great!) and I love her version of ""The Sun ain't gonna shine anymore"" for which she probably sang background vocals on original recording! The only song she really didnt work on was wonderful ""The Paradise is here"" and its a shame because it is a beautiful song.This is Cher on her most serious and I love it!"
5,A must for any Cher fan,"I thought that ""Believe"" was Chers' best album, then I listened to this. The music is diverse, ranging from the upbeat ""One By One"" to the slower and beautiful ""Angels Running."" Chers wonderful voice matches the excellent choice of songs perfectly."
3,The First Half Good; the Rest Not so Good,"The first five songs are uptempo to midtempo soul cuts where Cher shows us that she can not only sing soulful, R&B songs but sing them in a nice voice. She does sound nice esp after one gets over being surprised that she'd actually sing something like this. ONE BY ONE, NOT ENOUGH LOVE IN THE WORLD, PARADISE IS HERE, ANGELS RUNNING, and WHAT ABOUT THE MOONLIGHT all have nice vocals and good backgrounds as well. The rest of the songs are slow, boring ballads that I really do not feel at all. SOme may like them but I don't. THe first half is worth buying the CD alone."
2,Not her best,"I was disappointed by this CD. I bought it for ""Walking in Memphis"" and ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine"", which are great songs. Unfortunately, I don't feel the rest of the album is very strong. While Cher has a beautiful voice, most of the ballads are bland and slow - I found myself falling asleep by the time I got to ""Paradise is Here"" - the 5th track. I would only recommend this if you want soft background music at work; there's no dance hits or upbeat, toe-tapping pop songs. I have nothing against ballads and soft music, but this CD was almost boring at times. Again, the best word I can use to describe most of the songs is ""bland""."
5,"Just as elegant, beautiful and wild as Cher!","Being an huge Cher Fan, I consider this one of her finest albums.Totally underated! ""One By One"" cowritten by Cher herself is simply beautiful! As are so many cuts from this sadly underrated selection of music. Please note ""Angels Running,""""Walking In Memphis,"" ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore"" which has been covered by so many artists including Neil Diamond. Cher does it justice and reminds you of the original from the 1960's and though ironic due to the title of the song, ""a happier time!"" My favorite other than ""One by One"" which I consider a great song to dedicate to the ""One You Love,"" is""Love Is A Gunman"" which seems autobiographical of Cher's own personal love life. The song makes you feel and feel as if you were hit by feelings of longing or desire. As intense as a bullet. Listen and hope you enjoy. If not just for nostalgia, for some fine cover versions of other well known songs."
1,U.K. CHER MASTERPIECE RE-MIXED & DESECRATED,"Cher went to England and recorded ""It's A Man's World"" which stands as one of the greatest albums of the DIVA'S brilliant career that should have become the International comeback that ""Believe"" ultimately became but a weird and unnecessary remix of the U.K. classic is believed to be the reason this project didn't create a much deserved comeback...many feel that for some strange reason Cher's brilliant moment was sabotaged and anyone who listens to the original U.K. release which is soulful and brilliant then puts on this bizarre one tone ""U.S. Edition"" will come to the same conclusion. All the guts is removed along with the great rhythm tracks which make the U.K. release a complete soul stirring masterpiece so get the U.K version and enjoy Cher in her finest hour at her absolute peak!!! Please release the ORIGINAL~Cher doesn't deserve having one of her finest recorded masterpieces desecrated!!!!!"
4,"If you like Cher's It's A Man's World, check out The X-Files.","Yes, you read it correctly. The season 5 episode titled ""The Post-Modern Prometheus"" has a character with a Cher fixation. Cher's music is played throughout the episode, including her wonderful version of ""Walking in Memphis"" and the Spector-ish, if I might, ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore."" Older material is also used as well as a Cher-prise at the end. It's one of The X-Files most poignant episodes and well worth your time...especially if you are a Cher fan."
5,Book,"This book arrived in excellent condition. However, the information inside is very, very boring...but it was a requirement for this class so I'll have to live though it...ugh!"
4,Pleased,"I was pleased with my purchase of this textbook. The book was in good shape and it came in a timely fashion. I was suprised by the packaging--it wasn't bubble-wrapped or in a box, just brown paper."
3,Great Read,This book was a good read. We didn't utilize it much for my class but it was a lot of great infomation listed. The information is a great tool for managers and individual contributors alike.
4,This is a very useful book with first-rate information about change,I found the book very useful with excellent information about change. It presents a fine synopsis of different change theories with good samples.
1,works great....sometimes....,"Initially I believed this worked reasonably well. That is if you put up with the capture freezing periodically. However, after owning it for two months (and therefore stuck with it), I find that it will capture off my DVD player perfectly, but it will not capture at all from my VCR. There simply is no video in the preview box and it does not capture. Pinnacle's ""support"" is poor. Forget speaking to a person. I am currently waiting to hear a response from email, however I suspect that it won't be helpful. If it was not for the expense I would simply throw it away. It is beginning to take up so much time. All for wanting to transfer tapes to DVD. I did end up buying a Panasonic DVD recorder with a hard drive for that purpose. It works well, the only draw back being the inability to edit beyond creating scences.( which is great to edit out commercials)"
5,Good service,"I placed the order and received the product in 10 days, the product was as described and was of the quality I expected. There were no surprises and no excuses."
2,This video is not about Bullet Trains!,"If you are a Bullet Train enthusiast, you will be dissapointed to see that there are no footage of any modern high speed trains (japanese or french). The picture shown above can be deceiving. This video is only about history of high speed trains developed in Americas."
5,Nice toy,"I bought this for my daughter. When I saw this toy, I cannot remove the memory when she sang with this toy and dance on it. Thank you so much for giving me that kind of nice memory in my life."
4,Love this toy!,"I bought this toy for my 7 month old for Easter, and he absolutely loves it. For $40, this is a great purchase as it grows with your child through 3 different stages -- just learning to sit to master at sitting up and to standing and walking."
4,Its a dancing toy......,"I bought this for my niece when she was a yr old and she seemed to like it. So this christmas I bought it for my 11 month old....she seems to like it. Doesnt keep her interest that long, but then again..what does?? It seems durable as she yanks and plays with that dancing bear that spins around. The songs arent overly annoying but we did joke around that it seems the same lady talks for all the talking toys. The price has jumped a bit since we bought it, but its a pretty good toy."
5,My 1 year old son loves this!,My 1 year old son is always singing and dancing with this thing. The microphone leads for hours of laughter for the entire family.
3,Minolta ACT-100 Telephoto Lens,I chose to return my ACT-100 due to the fact that it provided only marginal enlargement of the image and weighed as much as the A2 camera itself.
3,Big lense!,"Clarity is good. It is the size of the Minolta A2 camera. 86mm outside (for your filters) verses 49mm normal. You extend the camera to maximum zoom, lock it in place with macro slide, go into menu mode (function-menu), tab 5 and select telephoto lense.The magnification is 1.5 times what the A2 already gives you. 3rd parties provide 2 times and 3 times lenses for half this price (grumble).I'll have fun learning how to use it with the camera!"
2,out-of-body experience- Good; toll house theory- heretical.,"Fr. Seraphim Rose's disclaimer regarding true, versus demon-inspired after-death experiences is sound and worth reading. This portion of the book, however, is followed by an exposition of the ancient theory of aerial toll houses where demons attempt to prevent the departed soul from attaining heaven. This is a distressing addition which is not mainstream Orthodox teaching; it has caused much controversy. See ""The Toll House Myth; the Neo-Gnosticism of Fr.Seraphim Rose"" by Rev.Dr.Michael Azkoul- Synaxis Press, ISBN 919-672,40-X"
1,This book is VERY strange,"I found this book to be very strange, disturbing, and disheartening. It drove me to read the Bible more and to seek solace in scripture and in the Roman Catholic church."
1,Voo-Doo Orthodoxy,"Intellectually dishonest, superstitious, manipulative in both it's sources and intent ; where does one start? This ultimately hateful paranoid tract has appealed to thousands and is what has given the late Fr. Rose such a following especially in Russia; go figure! Some people will believe anything but the truth."
1,Cheap lamp,"Kenroy Home 30437BRZ Spyglass 2 - Light Table Lamp - 100W (M) - 30437,Bronze - the description says ""2 - Light Table Lamp"" , but there was only 1 lamp that came with many pieces that you have to put together. Who wants to pay so much money for a lamp that you have to put together. And, besides I got a set of 2 Stiffel lamps from Costco for less than $100, and they were nice lamps."
4,Simple and Elegant lamp,"I recently purchased this lamp for my living room, as a wedding present to my husband and myself. The first shipment was missing parts, and as always, Amazon had a new one out to me in two days.The lamp is simple yet elegant. The shade looks beautiful with the lamp on or off and the bronze color, which is what we picked, is a deep dark bronze with hints of copper. We absolutely love this lamp."
4,A must - truly craptastic,"Let's face it, the writing, acting, direction, and special effects in Dante's Cove are all, shall we say, less than optimum. Still I relish how the actors bite into the storylines and give it their all no matter what. This is a guilty pleasure for my partner and me, and we usually watch it for laughs. This set is essential if only for Thea Gill's performance at the end of the season arc."
4,Excellent Season,"The gang are back for another season of mayhem. As with a lot of series television, they don't come into thier own until the third season and Dante's Cove is no different. Our main characters, Toby, Kevin, Adam Ambrosious, Diana, Grace and Brook are all comfortable with their roles. I am really pleased that Charlie David has lost his woodeness. I always found his acting to be stilted and not really believable, but in this season he is great. I was also pleasantly surprised that Reichen Lehmkuhl can act as well as being just drop dead gorgeous. The new cast additions are as always intriguing. But for me it is our main five characters that I love. I hope they will do another season and even a crossover storyline for Dante's Cove and The Lair where witches do battle with Vampires, and may the best set of pecs win. what a hoot! Congrats to all"
4,Cutting Edge,"Sexy, interesting and makes you want to come back for more. Do I hear a Season 4 in the making?"
3,Fair,"This season was a little surprising in how it followed last season. It was as if the powers that be did not expect to film Season III. It was also sad that some characters didn't return and others were gotten rid of pretty early in the season. I understand that there is to be a season IV. I hope more thought goes into this. Perhaps the writer's strike impacted this season's production. Nevertheless, it was entertaining."
2,i wont by from this seller,"this was the slowest shipping process that i have ever dealth with my entire internet shopping experience. never will I ever order though this seller again, yet product was received."
1,Bad show,"Ok, so the previews look good but this was one of the worst ‘gay’ shows that I have ever seen. It was just bad all-around. I would not waste your money on this show."
3,Gay Soap Opera at it's scariest,"I bought this DVD (and Seasons 1 & 2) as we are not fortunate enough to have gay networks available to screen this type of show in Australia.Season Three is significantly different to the first two seasons, with new characters, some missing old characters (eg Van) and a number of surprise plot twists that kept me guessing to the end.Good to see some S-E-R-I-O-U-S actors in the cast as a few of the leads appear to have learnt their craft from watching ""Days of Our Lives""!!!Any fans of Here! TV will not be disappointed."
4,liked this show,I liked this show and was sorry it had? to end. I thought it was going to be an evolving soap type of show. Sorry meant to say daytime drama. I like to listen to the commentaries that most dvd's include. sometimes it can be quite inane but the comments with this one was pretty good.
2,Disappointed,"We being a big fan of season one and surprised but pleased with season 2 I bought season 3 as soon as i was done with 2, kind of wish i had saved my money all-though the ending was unexpected but not in a good way this season left me frustrated and almost mad if they came out with a season 4 I would see it just hoping they fixed things, but for all you major Kevin and Toby fans I would stop at season 2 yes it leaves you wondering what will happen but wondering is sometimes better than the outcome...."
2,Just ok,Is just ok because again everybody have to be pretty young and cute and not all gay people is like that
3,Beautiful Trash,"All the men are beauties, all of the women are hot, the plot lines suck big time, but is that not the point? This show is just fun , fun , fun. But, sexy, I do not think so, it is just too vanilla and safe. And, the leads never turn around when the cloths come off- how hokie is that."
1,"Nice bodies, but sophomoric storyline and bad acting","I cannot believe that this show has a life. While the bodies are great, the acting is really bad and the plot is too simplistic (even for a fantasy piece). I guess it was low budget and they got the actors they could afford."
5,Just what I wanted,"Exactly what I wanted - Nice material, holds a ton load of chains, so far the snaps seem sturdy and well made"
5,A Truly Novel Approach to Literature,"Don't let the fact that Madame Bovary's Ovaries is a fun read fool you; the ideas contained within will forever change the way that you read fiction. Barash and Barash have managed to cogently describe their clever new way to analyze literature. It makes so much sense, you'll ask yourself ""why didn't I think of that"". In fact, you'll wonder why generation upon generation of English Lit. professors failed to pick up where Darwin left off.I think it's safe to say that just about any lover of literature will enjoy a fresh perspective of their old favorites after reading Madame Bovary's Ovaries."
3,More Science than Literature,"To keep this short, i will just state it: I was disappointed by this book. Not that its not well written, the authors have a firm grasp on language, but i was hoping for more literature dissertation than scientific jargon."
2,How do you get this thing to work?,"Fault #1: It comes with a remote. For some things you have to use the remote, for others you need to use the buttons on top of the frame.Fault #2: It has 4MB of internal memory. If you save photos at low resolution (and these screens have low resolution to begin with) you should be able to squeeze a bunch of photos onto the internal memory. Yet the specs only allow you to store 5(!) photos on the internal memory.Fault #3: It plays music, both WMAs and MP3s. Yet if you want to run a slideshow and play music at the same time you can only do that with MP3s, not WMAs.Fault #4: The biggest problem is figuring out how to get photos to fill up the whole screen and not look distorted. I haven't figured this out yet. I've tried cropping my photos 16:9 and 4:3 and saving them at different resolutions but I can't get them to fill up the whole screen without stretching them."
2,Spend a bit more and get something decent,"I bought this mandolin because it was middle of the road as far as price goes (not $75 and not $10). It's fairly sturdy (the only reason for the 2 stars), and the guard slides well. However, the blades are not nearly sharp enough. First try was an onion, and it would not even make decent slices at 1/4 inch. It mangled the layers of the onions and did not cut all the way through even once before ripping that layer off. Did not matter which way I placed the onion on the guard. Forget harder veggies like carrots or celery. Every slice was broken off at the back edge rather than cleanly cut through.I recommend going with something a little higher quality even if it costs a bit more. I bought this at Target and it will be going back tomorrow."
1,Dangerous!,"The Oneida slicer I received had a serious design or manufacturing problem. When the rear support was swung into place it put the slicer at an angle that prevented the front rubber feet from contacting the counter top. This allowed the slicer to slip and slide and made it very dangerous to use. I returned this item and bought the Swissmar Borner V-Slicer Plus, which works great."
3,mandolin,"the mandolin is a handy tool, however it was not as easy to use as it looked, It took several tries to get a decent slice and the end of each slice tend to break off rather than slice off."
2,Engineering Degree Anyone?,"I have always wanted a Mandolin Slicer and now that I bought this one from Oneida, I don't know why. The blades don't slide in easily and there is a lot of waste. It slices ok once I struggled with the blades, but it will only slice so far and then leaves big pieces unsliced. There are adjustment screws on the back, which are time consuming and annoying to get it right. To add insult to injury, Oneida sent out a flyer announcing it was ""on sale"" for $29, marked down from $50, when it's $29 anyway on Amazon. I hate that. And then I ended up having to hand slice the big chunks it wouldn't slice, as the safety gadget on top requires that the vegetables be presliced because it doesn't handle large pieces. I thought it would save me the trouble of dragging out my food processor. Trust me, a food processor is faster and more efficient. I don't know whether Mandolins are a waste of money, or this one is just not very good."
1,waste of money,"very poor instructions, even for China made junk, holder does not hold good, extra blades dont cut well, all because of poor instructions,"
1,Oneida Black Mandolin,"I had been looking for a good, sharp, reasonable priced mandolin.I purchased the Oneida.When slicing cucumbers and onions, it was very dull cutting.The onions were not uniform. The cucumbers were ""chewed"" slices.I returned it for a refund and still looking for a mandolin that cuts smoother and easier."
1,Not Good,I am currently looking for a new slicer after waisting my money on this one. My advice is that you spend a couple of more dollars and get yourself a better quality one. If you still want this one you can have mines for free out of my wasted money drawer!
1,I won't buy this again,"I bought this without reading reviews and because it was Oneida. Major disappointment, especially because I am very selective with the number of gadgets that I have in the kitchen. The plastic portions are not well made, very cheap and not even. The removable 3 smaller blades are almost impossible to slide into perfect position. The grip guard slides so badly that you will need all your energy to use this product. Frankly, a sharp knife is a better buy than this. And it is not because I did not read instructions or did not practice - I am quite an expert at kitchen gadgets. My biggest regret is throwing out the box before inspecting the product carefully and not being able to return it. This is comparable to any unbranded cheap mandolines found in the market."
1,Design Problem,"I agree with the other poor reviews of this product. I found that when slicing zucchini which was about 1 1/2-2"" diameter (yes, I forgot to pick it one day and it was that big the next, go figure), it was getting stopped by the screw on the underneath side and would jam and just get stuck, or break off when it reached the screw. The pictures on the box showed nice, big, round slices of things, but I don't know how they did it. I plan to return it today."
1,paul1168,"Crinkle cut blade DULL, food breaks off rather than cuts. Food falls off the holder. Definitely not worth $40.00. Don't waste your money."
1,Flimsy,This broke the third time I used it. I was slicing zucchini--hardly heavy use. Save your money. This is a piece of crap.
3,Hope you know German,"Nice device, instructions are in German, I did figure it out though. The top slider pins are not long enough to fit into the food item otherwise it is a nice investment for what I paid."
4,Good & Practical Book on Balanced Scorecard,"I've read most of the literature on the Balanced Scorecard and the previous books by Norton & Kaplan and Paul Niven himself. Being a Management Consultant of 15 years, I worked with numerous for-profit and not-for-profit organizations and have the usual skepticism towards theory books. This latest book on Balanced Scorecard was easy-to-read with numerous examples from Balanced Scorecard implementations in public sector. I found the step-by-step approach to be practical and quite down-to-earth with numerous take aways for a reader interested in BSC or a performance management practitioner, like myself. The book rightly touches upon the challenges in the scorecard implementations, and offers valuable advice. If you haven't read any previous books on this subject, you can read this book alone for a good idea on what the Balanced Scorecard is all about, and how you go about its implementation."
4,The bridge of strategic planning with operations,"I have been an enthusiastic user of strategic planning and proyect management since 1973.Fortunately in 1990, the gap between the strategic objetives and the day to day activities measure in resources was filled by a set of indicators and a methodology to integrate them paying attention to costumers, internal processes, development of human resources and financial aspects in a logical and orderly matter through balance scored card."
4,A very practical guide to balanced scorecard implementation,A step to step guide to implementing a balanced scorecard in government and nonprofit agencies from the master of one of the earliest scorecards in North America.
3,Review 2,I didn't find the book helpfull as a guidline book.... it will never help you if you don't have the practical experience
1,Cheap ... Get what you pay for,"This is a neat little slicer/peeler that worked once. I washed it and then the cheap stamped parts stripped their threads out so i could not re use it. I have machine and casting knowledge and can tell you that this is as cheap as it gets. Castings are porus and weak. Paint is thin and cheap. Stamped parts are barely threaded, maybe 2 turns holding, and fitted with sloppy fitting bolts. You might be able to peel a bag of potatoes or apples if your lucky. Can be fixed with parts that i found at a hardware store and a little effort. Average consumer will probably just throw it away. I can't remember if it said dishwasher safe or not but it rusted badly when i tried it."
4,Very fine speaker set. - Most important - makes me happy.,Just what I needed - 5.1 channel speaker system with the freedom to take the two additional rear-satellites and put them in a separate room to enjoy stereo sound transmission here and there. After that - easy enough to put them back to return to the full 5.1 DD or DXT listening configuration in the screening room.- IR remote slow response rate- the headphone jack could work all-the-time - just the main speaker-power could be switched ON/OFF via remote (or a button on the control box or both).
3,Good sound.... but wireless rear speakers suck,This system has great sound... I am pleased with that but the rear wireless speakers have no range and don't work half the time.... you have to have them like 10 feet from the transmitter in order for them to even pick up a sugnal. And don't plan on using a chordless phone around them.... Great sound but this system is worth.... 150-175 tops...
4,Finally wireless REARS and no wires,in Few wordsGreat crisp clear sound using my creative X-Fi Extreme Card (not using creative software plus they have not released for Vista as yet anyway).Not So Good: You really need to bump up rear volume to to get a good feel of rears in 5.1 surround sound mode which is non Dolby/DTS 5.1The control console/display unit heats up a little which initially concerned me but so far it has been working like a charm.I definitely recommend it.All the best!!
2,"Good speaker system, but wireless destroys 802.11b WiFi networks","These speakers work well, they produce good sound, and the controls and optical inputs work great too. However, if you or your neighbors have a WiFi (IEEE 802.11b or 802.11g) 2.4GHz wireless ethernet network, the wireless rear surround speakers in this speaker system will step all over the 802.11 WiFi network. I used a spectrum analyzer to see what was going on, and this speaker system appears to use frequency-hopping spread spectrum indiscriminately.Wireless speakers are a great idea, particularly for situations when running the wires would be impractical or ugly, but this particular implementation is incompatible with 802.11b/g WiFi networks. If this is not a concern to you (you *and* your neighbors are not using other 2.4GHz wireless products), then this speaker system may work well for you."
2,"Great sound, Major problems","One of the wireless speakers has a HUM, very loud, that persists even if I move it to a different electrical circuit, reset it, move it to a different part of the room. Therefore I don't use it - I leave it unplugged. Also, the volume control on the remote - which is sort of indispensable - does not work properly. The button sticks. I have never seen this before on a remote, except maybe 20 years ago with clunky TV remotes. I am waiting to see if Logitech will send replacements. A search of the web found many other people with similar problems, discussing it on tech bulletin boards.Still, the sound is great. I would have ordered another unit, for a different room of the house, but they clearly have quality control problems. If they fix this, I will post again."
3,"Great Sound, Great Wireless, Great Problems","Fantastic speakers when they work. My Brother and i both have a pair, but they frequently drop out, powering off entirely. They also cause a lot of wireless interference if you have a wireless network around. It's a shame, because it's a marvelous sound for such a compact and affordable unit. Thought it might have been a lemon, but both sets have the exact same problems."
4,True Wireless HiFi,"This is an excellent speaker system for the small living room along with your computer. The sound is distortion free to very high volumes, and it reproduced movie sound with excellent fidelity. Listening to music on this system is good except for some complex classical or ambient works."
5,great buy,"i love the surround sound system, it sounds great. i especially love the fact that the rear speakers are wireless. what i was disappointed with is that it is advertised as being able to work with both your desktop computer and entertainment center... and while this is true, if you plan on hooking it up to a gaming system, television, dvd player, etc you will need to buy converters (i bought mine at radioshack) to hook the rca cables for audio into the system. the only inputs for the system are for like the sound cables usually used for computers.either way, i eventually figured it out and i really love the sound system."
2,Failure to please,"The z-5450 has good points, reasonable cost, ease of use and ease of setup. It has a major fault in a buzzing noise made when the unit is turned on. Give this item a pass, wait for the next generation and a guarantee that this problem has been corrected."
2,Some Problems,"Some of the most annoying speakers I have used as of yet. I loved my [,,,] logitechs but needed more bass etc. I bought these last week and have had nothing but problems with them. The wireless speakers are crap they go in and out and if you have wireless internet forget about it. Id rather have them wired like the z-5500s. I would not recommend, get the z-5300es much better"
3,Beware- Misleading description,These speakers can only be hooked up to a computer. I ordered them and not until I received them did I realize that they did not connect to a receiver/ampifier. These are not speakers you would buy for your home theater system.
2,Poor Customer/Tech Support by Logitech,"After owning this system for two years, the wireless rear speaker stopped connecting to the receiver. The solution in the product manual doesn't work and logitech support can't provide a solution. If you're willing to mail in your receiver they will offer to give you up to 50% off the z-5500. Because of their inflated prices, it would actually be cheaper to just buy the z-5500 from amazon. Logitech's prices are too high for a poor product quality and incompetent tech support."
4,"Great sound, little annoyances, then died in 11 months","I purchased a refurbished unit, and the subwoofer was dead. I sent it back for an exchange, and included the control unit just in case. They replaced the control unit as well, and the new one could not be paired with the wireless speakers. Logitech customer support said that the wireless speakers and the control unit are paired at the factory, so if you have to request an exchange, be sure to request the whole set.After a month of shipping back and forth various parts, I finally have a working system, and the sound quality has not disappointed me.The system died about 11 months after purchase, and I returned it for a full refund from Logitech, as an exchange was not available."
5,Great for Small Home Theater,"I wanted this for the wireless (no speaker cable required) for the rear speakers. The power I had on all walls and was not a problem for my situation.The subwoofer is pretty big and I was not overwhelmed by the amplitude capability, but it is more than enough for what I need.I have to say, without the Harmony 550 remote control, I might be a little less satisfied. Many of the universal remotes seem to know nothing about Logitech as a Stereo supplier.In any case, for me and in this application, this is one great unit. I don't care if Logitech ""knows"" what components I have and if the neighbors can ""intercept"" the wireless transmissions they should check my Internet activity. Far more interesting than my TV habits I am sure.I would buy another one if I needed it."
4,Great system and sound (and I have a wireless network in my home)!,"This is a great system. I don't know about the other reviews and there problems, but mine works just as promised. I have one of the wireless speakers plugged into the same power strip as my Netgear wireless router and have never had a problem. At my old address, there were several people that had home Wi-fi and it worked fine there to.The only grip is that the rear speakers output is not adjustable. I would like a little more out of them, but ,even in retrospect, I would still buy this system."
5,Yes you can hook this up to a Home Theatre,"Ever heard of optical cables. Thats what you use and its the best way to connect your audio components. The description isn't misleading. Great for xbox, dvd players, receivers and some TVs. If you are willing to invest in some optical cables its well worth the money. The system is cheap for a great sounding 5.1 system."
4,"Compact, sleek, sounds great!","I've been using this system as my primary entertainment center (HDTV, DVD, XBox360, iTunes playback) and have been really happy so far.Hooking it up was a piece of cake. Sure, the rear speakers have power cords coming off the back, so they are not 100% wireless, but at least I didn't have to snake speaker cable underneath my carpet!The receiver is tiny and fits nicely on my shelf. The remote IS a bit dinky, which is my biggest complaint. The bass is VERY strong - most times I turn the sub woofer down because it's TOO strong at times. I'd recommend this system for anyone that wants compact, great sounding surround without the need to snake wires along the wall or under the carpet :)"
3,Why So Expensive?,"I bought this system for my computer and home theater about four years ago. It has been a great system for the price even though the rear speakers are not actually wireless. Each rear speaker has a big ugly black power cord that is more intrusive than a small wire that would go to the receiver (in this case, the back of the subwoofer). This means you also have to have one or two appropriately located power outlets. That being said, in many situations, finding appropriate power for the rear speakers is still less messy than running long wires from your rear surrounds to the receiver. What I don't understand is why this model is selling for so much new. I bought mine four years ago from Amazon and only paid $250 plus $25 shipping to Hawaii. Why would the price go up on an older system?"
2,Not Funny,"I like many of Stephen Chow's movies but this wan't one of them.I didn't find this movie funny and I didn't really like Stephen's character in this movie.I didn't care for the plot either.I thought this movie was stupid.I recommend that you see When Fortune Smiles,Fight Back To School 1-3 and King Of Beggars instead."
5,What a jump start!,"Dr. Muchnick's book is wonderful! It has a very positive voice and with the specific stories and ""Coach's Corner"" a place to review what you just read, geting on track and staying there is not only possible, but clear and simple. I am starting my own small company, and while I read this book for personal use I can see how it is easily applicable in business and corporate settings. It's a great book and I highly recommend it!"
2,meh,"the picture looks like it's one of the pillow packs, i received the cup ones, I don't know if that's better or not, but the taste is definitely different. I like these little packs more than the cup ones i got. misleading."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"This product has no number to call for the thousands (literally) of people who have experienced problems just capturing from their VCR to their computer. If you want to convert your old VHS movies into DVD, DO NOT BUY THIS. I am not the only person who thinks this; there are forums for this product on the Pinnacle website full of very angry people who have many problems, the most common of which is the audio and video being way out of sync. Hard to believe Pinnacle didn't test it for that problem before they sold it (and even worse if they did and sold it anyway). There's a very high probability that you will not be able to do what the product claims it can do."
1,Please Do Not Buy Pinnacle products,"First time I tried to buy a device to edit my home videos was a Pinnacle, it did not work called support they give me a discount to upgrade the software and still did not work!, called back then they told me to upgrade my computer, second time I tried with a Dazzle, again get into some trouble and guess what Pinnacle buyed Dazzle, again they offer a new software to fix the problem I said no thanks.My Brother in Law just buy this product Moviebox USB, does not work on Vista or Windows 7 even with the new drivers and guess what I just send email to the support and they just say:""We are sorry, but there is no support by phone, chat or email support for these products.Avid Customer Success""So do no buy this product stay away from Pinnacle."
4,Action sequel beats the original.,This sequel easily got 4 stars. In the beginning Tag the main character travels through timefrom 1250 to a lot of different times. All through that time he protected the canyon he lived in with his best friend from grave robbers. In the end he finds his dad and the canyon is protected. I thought that the author characterizied Tag and the people he met well. It is very suspenseful and made me read on. This is a very good book to read if you like the Indian culture or action books.
3,Useful but be advised...,"Overall the bag seemed just fine for what it is designed to do and the material is of adequate quality but be advised, I bought this for a 850gph pump and the bag is too narrow for it. You may want to check in advance that it will fit your pump before ordering."
1,from the Mission field...,"This is just a reply to the earlier review of ""josa"". Please don't give me the argument that all Christians are Christians because they grew up in a Christian family. I know plenty of people who are Christians who were never exposed to it while growing up...myself included! Not to mention the millions of other people around the world who came to Christ (by the grace of God alone) and were never raised in a Church background, many of them from countries where Christianity is outlawed."
4,"aka. ""What Every Pastor Should Read""","This book ""tears the curtain from the bottom up"" in the temple of Christianity. It is not just a Bible debunker classic; it also peeks at the machinations of Church systems and polotics. The book is a patch quilt of selected pieces edited nicely by Tim Leedom. A buffet of styles and lots of ""pull quotes"" renders it ""never boring."" Another page turner... -The Jackal."
2,About as polemical as the beleifs it rebuts,"Personally, I do beleive in God, although I have no use for the fundamentalist school of Christianity. That said, on with the review.Essentially, this book's essays are to show the fallacy of fundamentalism. At least that's what you get at first. But then the book makes the leap, with heavy sarcasm, into a diatribe against the very idea of any sort of theism, completely ignoring what good religion has accomplished in society (Ghandi, Martin Luther King, etc.).There are indeed better books that handle this subject in a more informative fashion. Primarily, this is only for those who feel that ALL beleif in God consists of ignoramuses who are being suckered by con men. I would agree that this is true in a lot of cases, but not in all."
1,Of the same caliber as some popular Christian books.,"This is one of the worst critiques of religion available. There are many very good books on the market that make good critiques, but this is not one of them. If I belonged to a church, I would hope that my opponents would read this book instead of any others, since it is the least competent, and the least likely to raise any serious challenges."
1,Defensive?,"It's funny how the reviewers here will note that Christians who read the book will be defensive. Seems like they themselves are the ones spending alot of energy defending their non-Christian stance.Read all you want about how Christ is just a fairy tale, but if you really believe that, let's hope you are right beyond a shadow of a doubt. Eternity is a long, long time to be wrong!"
1,"The least stars, the better the book","The success of a book challenging mainstream religious view is judged by the least stars given to it by the reveiwers who, understanbly, belong to the majority. Thus, my humble contribution.I noticed that books of this kind attract the most vitriolic, scathing and utterly unfounded nagative reviews. The more successful the book, the more negative the reviews."
3,A moderately helpful anthology,"As a popular anthology it contains articles of varying quality and interest. The editor has tried hard to make the book a scandal in the hope of achieving popular success. (Consider the title.) Since so little material of this type makes it to press and we are drowning in a sea of ""inspirational"" books with a strong Christian perspective, it is useful to have some dissent. The cheap graphics don't help at all."
2,I Can See Why Your Church Doesn't Like It,"I can see why any church would shy away from this book. It is atheistic in viewpoint and droll in content. It is not so much a book as a compilation of excerpts. It takes on a wide variety of Christian subjects, but doesn't plow much new ground. I bought this book because people who read ""The Christ Conspiracy"" were buying it. It was not nearly as good however. That book went deep into the mythic and astrological roots of the Christian church. This book tries to take on everything. It does it angrily and crudely. It almost reads like a college kid's scrapbook."
1,. . . because it's a waste of time.,"This is a rather poorly executed mixture of vitriolic anti-Christian sketches and essays with very little intellectual merit. No one should accuse the editor of originality because all of these arguments have been advanced a number of times elsewhere in almost identical formats. The some of the essayists are unable to avoid the usual religion-is-the-root-of-all-evil theory. Glaring errors in facts, logic and typography are abundant. For example, they placed Solzhenitsyn on their list of ""free-thinkers"" even though he is, in fact, Russian Orthodox.Beleivers need not be concerned about this title because it isn't anything that hasn't been encountered elsewhere. If you're skeptic, there is little in this book that you haven't already heard or isn't available in a better format. All in all this is a wretched book competing in the already crowded field of atheist agitprop."
3,"Good materials, poor production values","The book contains an excellent assortment of contemporary and historical freethought writings organized into broad categories, including Fundamentalism, Church & Society, and even Dead Sea Scrolls. The book's impact suffers, however, from the poor copy-editing and composition. In particular, I stumbled over a profusion of typo's, poorly reproduced and sometimes crude illustrations, and occasionally slap-dash page design. The editors should better identify the author of each piece and the date it was written, and the source and date of each quotation. The threat to the United States from religious fundamentalism has grown and metastasized since this book appeared in 1993, so perhaps a revised and expanded edition is in order."
3,Expect some surprises,"The book is fast moving and informative. It slows down and become rather boring from page 280 to 341. This portion ought to have been abridged. The rest of the book was not that informative, as the news media has covered much of it extensively. It did leave with the desire to read more of the 'freethinker's. The list of 'freethinkers' gives one a place to start."
2,Flawed Logic,"This book is am interestingly and amusingly blend of fact, myth and anecdote. But ultimately, when closely examined, the authors' arguments rest on the same logic as the arguments they are attempting to portray as illogical.If this book shakes yout faith in your religion, you probably did not have any real faith when you pick it up.Nevertheless, it is a fun little read."
3,Note about 'CaptainReflection' and his supposed 'review',"'CaptainReflection' is certainly NOT a qualified book reviewer, but rather a bombastic purveyor of smiteful diatribe against Christianity. While he elucidates certain salient points in the history of Christianity, he in no regard reviews the book! (which he was supposed to be doing) He, instead, 'reviews' Christianity. Read the book and think for yourself. CaptainReflection has fallen into the very trap which he tries to warn YOU of! I apologize for not writing a review, either, but I could not let his 'review' go unanswered."
1,"Unfortunately, an anti-religion diatribe","For a student of religion, there was not enough meat on the bones in Leedom's collection of anti-religion material. Hints of astrology and pre-Christian Essenes, brief comparisons of pre-Christ figures etc. But not enough of anything to satisfy one's curiosity."
1,Somewhat disappointing.,I felt the notebook was just a repeat of other books the author had written. Much of it was out-of-date. Nothing really new.
1,NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY,i clicked thinking it was a smoken deal and found out it was not. it is a cover band they are ok but its just a little off. i would not wast my money.
4,Great Speakers for Travel,"I was really suprised by the strength of these speakers and how they can fill a room with sound. For speakers of their size, these slim speakers have fairly good bass and excellent mid and high. I do get some slight vibration in the base (stand) of the speakers if I play a song with strong bass at a high volume, but only at the highest volume levels. Also, the only other issue I have is that there is no volume control on the speakers, it uses your device as the volume control. Other than those two things I would say that the product is perfect. Also, you get better bass and little higher volume if you use the AC adapter instead of batteries, but even with batteries the performance is only slightly less. I would rank it 8.5 out of 10."
5,logitech speakers,I love my new speakers. they are the perfect size for what I am using them for. Very compact and portable.
4,Logitech speakers very cool,"Looks nice enough to leave out on my desk. Great portability and protection. Sound quality is very good, but then I don't crank them or expect much low range. But why is the cord so short? I realize there was a consideration for the cord storage, but even an extra 6"" would have been great. The speakers literally have to be rubbing up against whatever you connect them to. I like to keep my iPod close to me on the desk so I can skip through songs, adjust volume, etc. but I don't want the speakers right next to me. I bought a cheap cord extension and that has solved the problem. Otherwise, I'm very pleased."
2,"Sound great, but beware of the auto shut-off feature ..","I got these to upgrade my laptop speakers while in its docking station. The good news is they sound great. The bad news is they were designed with an auto power-down feature to prolong battery life. Even though mine are plugged into the AC power adapter 100% of the time, they shut down without a music signal running thru them. I sometimes play classical music in the office and even have had them shut down in quiet passages of some pieces, or even between songs. This is not documented anywhere in Logitech's instructions or packaging, but can be verified thru their tech support.They are probably perfect for their intended use as a battery powered portable speaker system, but under AC power with a permenent install, they have been a disappointment."
2,Annoying Auto-Shut Off Feature,"The sound quality of the speakers is decent considering the portable size, but I must say I have one major complaint that I think anyone purchasing this product should realize: it has an annoying auto-shut off feature that does not allow one to listen to the speakers at a low volume. If you want to use these speakers to listen to music quietly while you study or work, look elsewhere. I am trying to listen to music at a low (but clearly audible) level, and the speakers keep turning off. The problem is the speakers think I'm not playing anything, so they power off. And if I turn my iPod up any more to keep it from happening, the music is too loud to concentrate.Please be aware that the volume threshold for the auto-shut off feature is way too high!"
3,Okay for the price,"They're cute and pack up nice and flat. That's the best aspect of this portable speaker. On the negative side, as others have said, the bass is weak - listening to old 80s New Wave on these speakers is quite a disappointment. :-) Also, the audio connector cable is quite short, you'll need an extension cord if you're using your laptop while listening to music, or the speakers will be stuck off to one side, and that's another thing to pack!"
4,Great Portable Speakers,"As portable Speakers, these are fantastic. Its a speaker you can just through into a bag or in the car. Long battery life, compact design, speaker is protected when closed up. The sound is very acceptable as a portable speaker. Sound isnt great at high volumes, and it lacks a volume control. So if you are hooking up a Home Theater system, these probibly arnt for you, but if you want something to take out and about, these are the go.Ive had these speakers running off batteries for over 40 hours now and they are still going strong."
4,very good and affordable,Bought these for the wifes laptop and iPod... this thing has great sound quality and its very portable. The stand is actually the case that covers and protects the front... which is very handy. Can use it plugged in or cordless on AA batteries. Got it a couple years ago and its still going strong. Worth the 20 bucks I spent.
3,Nice speaker for my XM Receiver.,"I wanted a portable speaker for my XM Roady receiver and this seemed to fit the bill. It functioned well right away with easy connection and no problems. It is a low end speaker, but cheap and right for this application."
4,Love it,"Love this thing. The cord that connects to the player is too short and if it isn't positioned properly, you can get a rattle, but otherwise it's wonderful. I think I'll buy another one."
5,Portable Speakers,"I purchased this set of speakers to use with my DVD player. The player did not have enough volume to be able to hear over an air conditioning unit in a hotel room. With these speakers that was not a problem! We could all hear the movie without having to crowd around the player. The fact that they were plug and play was wonderful,no difficult instructions or connections."
4,good portable speakers,"The sound is pretty good, especially if you can get it for under $20. The battery life is amazing.The only downside is the cord is too short and you need an extension (otherwise I would have given it 5 stars)"
4,A Steal!,"These speakers are worth the price (I paid under $25, shipping not incl.). Sound quality is great, volume is sufficient under most circumstances, and the batteries last a long time (takes 4AA's). I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because when I put the batteries in, I couldn't get the farthest 3(the 1st 3 batteries which I put in) back out. The brand of NiMH batteries which I use do not slide as well as some disposable alkalines which I also tried out. The NiMH's were stuck in there! But I modified the speaker's case really easily. All I did was drill 14, 1/8"" diameter holes all along the case where the farthest 3 batteries were on the inside (about 3/16"" apart). The holes are there to allow you to use a small ""poker"", to push the batteries out. But if you use AA's which slide better than the ones I have, you won't have to modify the case at all."
1,Very Bad Product,"I bought a new Logitech mm28 portable speakers and since the first time I connected to my Zen Vision M, it turn off by itself 3 or 4 minutes later, without any reason. It's more expensive to take it back to claim my guarranty because shipping & handling. So I'll lose my product. Directly to the garbage basket. Never More!!!!!!"
3,"Was fun for a while, but had to get real speakers eventually","I used this speaker for a little while as I got a massive discount on them. I travel a lot. It's good for amplifying the sound a bit, but it's not truly powerful. It is how ever very easy to travel with, relative to other speakers. Also, it does break easily. I think mine lasted about 3 months. Very disappointing. However, I still give it 3 stars, b/c relative to the other really crappy speakers I've used, that is about where this sits.If you really need speakers, get real speakers. Travel ones are rarely going to put out the kind of real sound that a person will expect."
3,"Good sound,",It is a little bigger than I hoped.. should have looked at size more closely but sounds good. My laptop speakers are low so this is nice when I catch up on my shows online.
4,Good personal speakers,"I just bought these speakers based a review I saw on another website. They sound great when you're listening to soft music or hard music at a lower level, but the bass is extremely distorted at higher levels (which is a problem for me as I'm a HUGE Red Hot Chili Peppers fan). Also, they don't get extremely loud, but thats ok for me as I don't plan on using these in loud places anyway. I love the size and look of it.For the price, these things sound pretty damn good. Despite the problems I listed, I'm happy with my purchase. As always you get what you pay for."
2,hard on the ears!,"As long as you don't raise the volume this is fine...however for use with audiences during presentations, it is extrememly hard on the ears...the lack of sound clarity doesn't help either"
3,Decent sound for the price,For the price and for what it is this speaker is a solid purchase.I got it for $15 and would not pay any more than $20 for it. It is actually larger than I pictured and a bit thicker than I though it would be judging by the picture but it does put off pretty good sound and decent bass.Has a nice look and doesn't feel cheap. A good travel speaker to have and you won't be too worried about it getting broken or lost since it's only $20.
5,Excellent buy!,I was amazed at the quality of the sound that comes out of this speaker. I would highly recommend!
1,Auto shut off,"Pros: cheap, nice design, light weight.Cons: shuts off either when volume is too low, or when the music is too silent.I do not see why Logitech should decide at what volumes I am to listen to my music. I like listening to music at low volumes when I'm doing my homeworks, but it only gets irritating when having to switch the speaker back on every 5-10 minutes or so.Logitech should not have had this auto shut off feature, or at least informed about it.I would not recommend this to anyone, unless you are looking for a portable speaker to bring to the beach or something, listen to loud music, and then throw away afterwards. For other, more varied purposes I find this speaker to be worthless."
3,"Good sound, a few minor mechanical design flaws","The speakers sound pretty great when hooked to the computer or to an MP3 player. The bass is full yet the mid and high ranges are well covered.The mechanical design is less impressive. The audio cord is far too short to connect to any computer, obviously designed only for MP3 playback use. The idea of opening the speaker cover as a support stand would be great if there were more angles at which the support were stable. Instead, if opened to angle the speakers even slightly upward, the unit falls over backwards.The unit turns itself off if no input is detected for a while. I haven't yet decided if this is a great feature (keeps from wasting the batteries) or really bad (missed audio cues for incoming email when connected to the computer)."
3,"Not Great, But Certainly Beautiful.","Okay, so the 3rd album from singer/songwriter Iris DeMent doesn't quite match the heartfelt emotions and simple brilliance of her first two efforts. But My God! Her voice, quite wonderful to begin with, has gotten better and stronger and is simply beautiful. The production on this cd is a little too ""Nashville"" for my taste, but hearing Iris sing her songs is still a pleasure, especially on the tunes where she plays piano, which she does beautifully. The two gems here are the opening ballad, ""When My Morning Comes Around"", and ""This Kind of Happy"", co-written with her idol Merle Haddard and featuring her most accomplished vocals yet. These two tracks are the highlights and alone are worth getting this disc for."
3,I liked her prior stuff a lot better.,"As a recent discoverer of this super folk talent, I really enjoyed her Infamous Angel album. But on this newer release, ""The Way I Should"", her pure, simple voice is somehow shoved into more mainstream C+W with electric guitars and drums, missing the point. Luckily, her voice and lyrics are still in there someplace."
5,"literally a ""life changing"" album","Ok, so call me a cornball, but this album, which is now a couple years old , has made more difference than most anything I've ever heard or read. "" I alone will know, when I've climbed the great big mountain"" thanks, Iris, as someone who is always seeking approval from someone else, this lyric and others in the song "" WHEN MY MORNING COMES AROUND"" gave me perspective. since buying this album,a lot of changes have taken place in the way I look at the world and my place in it. By the way, it sounds good too!ok, so maybe this album isn't as ""pure"" as the others and may alienate folks in many ways (parts of it even irritate me) but it's thought provoking and isn't that one purpose for music, especially folk music? Iris, keep telling us what you're thinking!"
2,Who is this person and what did she do with our Iris?,"Taken by itself, this album isn't all that bad. Looking at the country genre as a whole, it's better than a lot out there. But compared with Iris's debut it's heartbreaking to see her downslide into what my grandmother would call Nashville Trash.The pure-hearted simplicity I fell in love with has been replaced by overblown arrangements and a deep, dogmatic cynicism. ""When My Morning Comes Around"" and ""This Kind of Happy"" are the better tracks on this CD, but they pale to pretty much all of Infamous Angel. ""Trouble"" and ""Letter to Mom"" are just plain embarassing.Iris, where did you go wrong?"
2,"Preaching to the Choir, Unfortunately","Iris DeMent has done in this CD what so many successful artisans have done. She has taken her considerable talents and used them to promote her political agenda. In doing so, she has risked offending a large part of her audience. For some artists (Woody Guthrie and Joan Baez, for example) this has been a successful strategy. And it may work for Iris. But she may only have succeeded in alienating many of her fans by loading this CD with uninformed blather (Wasteland of the Free), uninspired sympathy (Letter to Mom), and tedious monotony (over 5 minutes of There's a Wall in Washington). Iris is a unique vocal talent, as evidenced by her earlier CDs, who is capable of more entertaining and inspired work. She is brilliant in her duets on John Prine's CD (In Spite of Ourselves). Let's hope she will choose future work that will attract a more diverse audience. She has too much talent to be preaching to the choir."
2,Confusing and Hard to Read,"I had four months to visit 18 countries in Europe and go castle hunting. I thought this atlas would be a great guide. I did find where I was going, but with little help from this atlas. 1) There is a 1"" gap between the pages because of the spiral binding, and this also cuts names of cities and the roads in half. 2) The roads and motorways are not labeled very well. 3) The roads' colours are very similar and hard to differentiate. 4) The cover states ""The fastest routes around major cities"" Where is this information? I have still yet to find it in this atlas. 5) Why are the countries split up so much. I had to view pages 22-23, then 36-37 and then 50-51 just to see where I was going? American Atlas has the rest of the state on the following page, not 10 pages away. I was extremely disappointed in this atlas."
2,Hard to Use,"I have taken several road trips across Europe and I have always used Rand McNally's European Road Atlas. Unfortunately they seem not to produce it anymore. Instead, I bought Frommer's Europe Road Atlas for a trip we are planning next year. After examining it thoroughly I have decide to return it. The main reason why is the approximate one-inch gap in the middle of all the pages due to the spiral binding. Also, all of the road colors are very similar so it is very difficult to tell whether you are looking at a highway, a toll way or a four lane road. In addition, there are very few city maps and the ones that are there have almost no detail. I would not recommend this map."
5,Best Book out on Outpatient Surgery,I had Dr. James Macho as my surgeon 15 years ago for ruptured Appendix. He is a great doctor and a great gentle man who explains everything. His wife is a nurse and she had some input in this book. My husband went out and bought the book for me and Dr. Macho signed it. Even if he had not told us about it I would have purchased it after looking through it in a bookstore with illustrations and detailed information. It answers so many questions and you are more comfortable with the procedures. No one is going to get my copy of this book as it covers 18 different surgeries and anesthia information. I really recommend this book. You never know when you are going to need it.
1,I paid $6 for 364 words. Amazon took advantage of me.,"I bought a book about housing for schizophrenic people.It cost $6 and is 364 words long! Is that reasonable?Plus the date as you can see below was 2005 on the listing, but 2001 on the actual 364 words.I feel taken advantage of.Housing a Clinical Issue In Schizophrenia Care.(supportive housing combining independent living with needed services)(Brief Article): An article from: Clinical Psychiatry News - Digital - HTML (June 1, 2005) by Lynne ChristensenBuy: $5.95"
2,A little useful information,"First of all, Mr. Pendarvis tells us about how he spent years of his life working at starting a ""small business"" ultimately to fail miserably.After his life's failures, he finally builds a company that succeeds and the remainder of the book is a glorified advertisement for that company and how you should use his company to find your small business.At one point in the book, he talks about going to church and how he has to start off every day with prayer, etc. Not long before that I was reading about how to cheat the government out of taxes. Officially, he says that he will not say that it is ""right or wrong"", but then spends several paragraphs justifying it.There are a few useful bits of information in this book, but overall, I think there must be something better out there on this subject."
1,Not worth it,"Much of this book is dedicated to Ed's business ventures - namely his current brokerage. It is, in my opinion, a long advertisement to use his company to buy a business. There is very little discussed about finding a business, buying a business, and what steps to take to get to the point of buying a business. There are 2-3 chapters that have some decent information, but little in the way of detail. You would be better off saving your money."
4,Good book to read. Could have been much shorter.,"I just finished reading this book. This book has educated me a bit about buying a business. However the book could have been much much shorter (probably one fifth if not less). Seller financing is always expected. I've seen zero down payment deals but Ed never mentioned about that. I guess as a business broker (he's a business broker), no down sounds like no commission? Good book to read."
2,Reconsider,I would suggest another book. Just a lot of words and not much substance. The author has some good points but I could paraphrase this book book in less than a page (216 otherwise).
4,Buying a small business,"This book is good overview for understanding small businesses, how they operate and how they are valued. If you are seeking a new career or want to be your own boss this book is a great starting point in finding the business that is right for you."
4,Great program,"Braceface is definitely a family program. My eight year old daughter loves to watch it. Some of the episodes that we have seen are geared towards kids in the pre-teen years, but most are very family oriented. I wish that the program still came on tv here in the states, but unfortunately it doesn't."
5,A master of short fiction!,"Mort Castle is a master of the short story. This gem of a collection visits other worlds and times and explores darker corners of the human heart with wit, flair and daring. Dark fantasy is seldom this literate, and I love pulp as much as the next guy, but Castle is the kind of author who can make you re-read a sentence just because it dazzled. Well worth your time."
5,My #1 tennis book,"This is the best of instructional books out there. The author does not give you a glam rock romp of who he has instructed on the tour, but instead he gives YOU the ""I want to be better than average club player"" guy some solid advice on more than just tennis stroke production which you probably already have in place in your game. You actually remember the advice in a match, you use it to improve your game that is in place already and you are given tools to complete your game on and off the court. This is the book that took me pushed me beyond a 4.5."
4,"Very Good, Complete Tennis Analysis","I bought this book as I have mentally been struggling with nerves in match play. There were a couple of chapters on the psycology of tennis and how to deal with nerves and pressure. I found those helpful. The famous sports psychologist, Jim Loehr was quoted in there quite a bit.While I did not buy the book for stroke production that is the substantial part of the book and they covered every shot imaginable with emphasis on their ""Smart"" approach. This is a large book that I could see in any Tennis Pro's office as it is great reference material and you could hand out to students who wanted to read more on a problem. Also, there were quite a few references to drills to preform on different shots.Overall a very good, informative book."
3,Pretty Good,Its a pretty good book overall. I would have liked more technique instruction. But overall it was good. I would recommend this book.
5,Excellent Read-I'd be lost without it,"What can I say, VERY nicely done. Mr. Trento takes into consideration EVERY theory (of the time) that existed and puts it to the test. From ""root cellars"" to Celtic structures, from ""glacial movement gouging"" to Phonecian writing! Thoroughly documented, mapped and written.A RARE find for today. Showing how narrow minded most archaeologists can be when it comes to how history was written. Trento sets the trend for the future. If you are interested in America (B.C.) and want the facts to come to your own conclusions, be sure you venture all the avenues. And take this book with you! (Thanks for writing back to me Mr. Trento)."
2,"i'm assuming the previous reviews are a joke, right?","what are you guys thinking? 5 stars? you've obviously never heard paul at his prime when he fronted the mighty 'Mats. his solo career has been a major letdown, and this album is the worst of the bunch. do yourself a favor: go out and get Tim or Pleased to Meet Me and find out what 5 stars really sounds like...."
3,"There's a lot worse music than this, but a lot better too","I was first motivated to write this review because I couldn't believe *none* of the previous reviewers mentioned the excellent stand-out track ""Ain't Got Me."" I love both the hooks and his message to the recording industry. ""Love Untold"" is a beautiful song too. I'm lukewarm to most of the rest of the album; hence the 3 stars.To those who say ""It's not the Mats, but it's better than anything on the charts today,"" my answer is: True, but there's so much out there in the 90s that *doesn't* make the charts that's better than this album. Do yourself a favor and listen to some Elliott Smith or Wilco or Belle & Sebastian or the Dutch group Johan, to name a few. This scene may not match up to the Mats/REM/Huskers peak of the 80s, but it's more interesting than just listening to those guys' 90s efforts."
1,Where's the Proof Louise? A gender bias perspective!,"This feminst author does more to harm than good to protectthe best interests of America's children. She does not havea degree in psychology or medicine. She continues to claimthat father/daughter incest is rampant throughout America.Yet, she backs it up with no data whatsover. She refusesto accept that the the reality is that some women will falsy accusetheir child's dad of abuse solely to get custody. Shebelieves women should be believed without qualificationsoley based on their gender. This book is a DO NOT READ orRECOMMEND and is more propoganda to eliminate fathersand dads then anything else."
3,Celti Knotwork Explained?,"Acknowledging the complexities of this book's approach to Celtic Knotwork, Iain Bain, George Bain's son, has published a much more approachable introduction in his Celtic Knotwork, Constable, London 1986. It was reprinted last in 1992 but is unfortunately out of print. Used copies are available and I would stongly recommend Iain Bain's book as a most helpful place to begin. The senior Bain's book is however an informative reference, a far cry above the usual ""picture book for colouring"" approach."
1,"Poor ergonomics, missing important hex wrench sizes.","The Roadie Rench contains a medium Phillips screw driver; a medium slotted screw driver; a wire cutter; and the following hex (Allen) wrenches: 1.5mm, 2.5mm, 3mm, 0.050"", 5/64"", 3/32"", 5/32"".It does not include a 5/16"" nutdriver, the tool needed to adjust Gibson necks. It does not include 1/8"", 3/16"" hex (Allen) wrenches, the most popular sizes to adjust Fender necks.The string cutter will not cut bass strings.The large handle on this tool makes using the screwdrivers very awkward in tight places. It is impossible to adjust a tune-o-matic bridge with such a large handled screwdriver.It is more practical, and less expensive, to carry the correct size wrenches and screwdriver in your guitar case."
1,Insipid and Lousy,"Beyond the first few pages (after the table of contents) the book takes a drastic spiral down into some awkward realm of writing akin to the Western mythology of Zen and centering your chi. There are numerous instances of pages containing one sentence, signifying some graphic designer was having happy time with Swiss design. Furthermore, the content on those blank pages is not strong enough to support the white space.What the Author sorely overlooks is that the goal of a good artist statement is in the content - describing some of the why and the what - and distilling it into its essence through brevity. A good artist statement is not about breathing exercises and finding a quiet place wherein to perform the act of writing an artist statement (which a sizable chunk of the latter half of the book seems to dwell on).For those considering purchasing the book, your time, money, and energy are better spent trying to pound a nail in the floor with your forehead."
1,Disappointed,"Too little content that is useful. This book is mostly about giving the writer a pep talk to actually write the artist statement. The first few pages are the best part, the rest could be cut."
2,gets by in a pinch,I've used this item to provide a video feed from a professional HD camera system to an onboard monitor in a production environment. The cable is priced very reasonably and would work fine in an installation setting but when used with a camera on a crane the connections frequently shorts when the camera is moved or the connectors are touched. I would recommend this cable for broadcast or consumer installations only but NOT FOR USE in critical moving camera or monitor applications. The connections will short at the most critical moment. Avoid this cable for professional on camera use.
2,OK quality,I purchased the cable about several months ago and it is already shot. It worked find for awhile now I need to get a new one. For the price it is not a bad deal though.Shipping was great the product was in my hand in 2 days with regular ground shipping.I would recommend this for anyone needing a quick fix.
5,Incredible training guide,"Uncertified Public Safety Bomb Technician, member IABTIThis book is a MUST-HAVE for any person or units' pub/reference library. Contrary to another review, it IS an instruction guide, and assists the reader who is tasked with IED / EOD responsibilities. While it is no substitute for training under a qualified staff, it's a damn close second."
4,A Good Refrence,"This book is a great reference for all emergency personal and should be read. It is not an instruction manual, and by no means will make one an expert. But it will give the person a concise and clear overview and guidelines of what to do in an emergency situation."
4,An interesting paradox.,"The Miracle Strain seems to open a whole can of worms upon its reading. The book brings about a strong ethical question; is it all right to search for the body of Jesus? This question is answered by many people in many ways throughout the book. The main character, a doctor, believes it to be the only way to cure some of today's worst diseases, i.e. by finding the only perfect human being. His arch nemisis answers the question quite simply, ""Why else would a mortal search for the genes of God? If not to become God himself?"" The book is a very creative journey, and an excellent first novel. Although some parts of the plot could be considered a little far fetched other pieces make up for it. The Miracle Strain is a good book, well worth the money."
1,"Miraculous pain from ""The Miracle Strain!""","All I can say after reading this abomination is that I have never read anything like it. The plotter is utter compost, and I would have enjoyed watching grass grow more that reading this mind-numbing plot. And beyong the sleep-inducing storyline of this ""story,"" the depth of the characters, or lack there of, left me yearning for a more intelligent and in-depth book, say, ""Run, Spot, Run?"" Read this book only if you are extremely depressed, you may well get a good laugh out of it!"
3,great story but poorly written,"I read this book after it was highly recommended by a friend who works in a bookstore - the concept, the story, the twists were all fabulous, I loved the blending of ultra modern science with religion and secret brotherhoods. I'd say that the story kept me hooked, but I couldn't help feeling dissatisfied with the writing style, and the characters were a bit too cardboard-like for my taste. But worth reading anyhow because the story is so intriguing. I hear the film rights have been sold, so perhaps this might be a case where the film will be better than the book."
4,Good book with original plot,This is a good book with detailed explanation of how DNA works. Easy to read and a very original plot. Very interesting characters used with ample description.
3,"Improbable, but readable!","It seems that as soon as you read this book you will be drawn into the main characters depressing life, after losing his wife, and then finding out his daughter has brain cancer you wonder why he is bothering to live himself, but the book not only focuses on his struggle to deal with what life has tossed his way but also his race against time to find a cure for his daughter! Compelling reading, and a very good plot!"
3,"Not excellent, but not THAT bad","No, I didn't think the writing was stellar, and it could have definitely been polished in some places, but the story was good. The twist of the way the genes work was inspired. Perhaps it's not a terrific, excellent, or even great or very good, novel, but it is decent, and more readable than some of the others I've read lately (avoid Gemini Man, One of Us, to name just two, like the plague)"
3,Wait for the movie.,Buy the paperback for a long journey - this book can be read in one sitting. The idea is interesting enough to carry you through the rather linear and predictable plot. An average book that that will obviously make a very entertaining film.
2,A book in which I had to strain my eyes from closing.,The thing that I liked about this book was how well-described the characters were. All of the main characters were described with such detail so that you can get a mental picture of what they may look like in real life. The things that I did not like about the book was that it was very boring and slow. This book did not interest me in any such way and there was not enough detail in the events which occured. There was so much jumping around from place to place which made it slightly confusing. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone because it was boring and didn't keep me wanting to read on.
1,"Great idea, abominable writing","Cardboard characters, cardboard writing, cardboard plot. A great idea spoiled by a complete lack of atmosphere. This is a badly-disguised pitch to the barons of Hollywood, not a real book. Skip it"
2,"Intriguing idea, shame about the execution","Yes, it's High Concept; what if gene technology could help emulate the healing powers of Christ?Sadly, the writing is flat, the plot is pedestrian, the characters clichéd.Michael Cordy was in marketing for 10 years prior to writing this, his debut, and it shows. He tries his best to push all the right buttons, but he just does so too clumsily. I wanted this book to be exciting, and I really stuck with it, but ultimately, beyond the basic premise it was just too flawed and uninspired.Looking to read easily digested suspense that toys with novel ideas on science? Try something like ""Lightning"" or ""Phantoms"" by Dean Koontz."
5,A thrilling tale of intruige,"An excellent book, especially for a first work. I would highly recommend this book to everyone. At times a little difficult to believe, Cordy still manages to draw you in and not make you care whether a premise is believable or not. Cordy definitely has the makings of a Robin Cook. If you're going to read it, make sure you have lots of time available because you won't be able to put it down."
1,Buy Something Else,"My family has been using sound machines for years, we bought this 2 1/2 year ago for our daughter. After a year and a half of it working *perfectly*, it started making this noise that I can only describe as a digital speed bump at the end of the cycle of noise. We loved the machine up until then, so we bought a second one. Only after 10 months, this time, I woke up one night to my daughter crying. She was woke up by this terrible noise and couldn't put herself back to sleep. The noise is very annoying and you can't help buy lay awake and wait till it makes the noise again. We are throwing this away and spending a little more money on something that, hopefully, won't make a digital speedbump noise."
1,"Great sounds, but rather large, light-weight, and way too bright!","As other reviewers wrote, this rather large alarm clock is extremely light in weight, and I too knocked it off the dresser often. The worst feature of this alarm clock is how bright the projection is. The clock face (the green numbers) has two settings (high or low), but there is no method of adjusting the brightness level of the projection. I usually like having a night light in the room, but it's difficult to sleep with this incredibly bright blue light (it's brighter than having my 32"" TV on). I can't sleep with the projection on at all! I currently have it in the living room, where we can see the projection on the ceiling with the curtains open at noon! As other reviewers stated, it does have lots of great features (all the different sounds, adjustable volume, focus adjustment on the projection) but overall, it's just too bright!"
2,Time keeps changing itself,"This is great as a noise machine but that's it. I've had this clock for about a month now and I have it plugged into the wall, but it still randomly resets the time. For example, last night when I went to bed the time was correct, but when I woke up this morning at 10 the clock said it was 5:45. This isn't the first time his has happened. It has been rendered useless as an alarm clock and as a normal clock. It's really too bad because the projection is great and the sounds are relaxing!"
2,Cute and Compact,"I bought this clock because I just wanted a projection clock and the sounds seemed like an extra. Its well made but I'm not completely happy with it. First the projection light beams a bright blue light onto the ceiling which is way to bright at night. I tried to dim the light with tape, but now its only blurred. The projection arm stops at a 90 degree angle facing forward...so to get the arm to lower you have to turn the clock away from you to adjust the tilt of projection...annoying. The sounds are OK, if you listen closely thought you can hear the repetition in the sounds playing over and over again. It irritates me more than relaxes me. One more thing...I placed in on the dresser and kept hearing a buzzing sound, when I took it off the dresser and placed it on the bed, the noise disseapered, it took a minute to figure out it was too close to my cordless phone. Now I have to keep my phone on the floor when the clock is playing noise...annoying."
2,It's like sleeping under the light of a full moon,"We just got this clock yesterday, and like many of the other reviewers says, the projection light is very bright. I had no issues sleeping, but I can see how someone who may be light sensitive would have trouble sleeping. It really felt like we were sleeping with the full moon shining on us. I also think the projection focus feature is a little limited. The sounds are okay, the summer night sounds a little like a car alarm in the distance, but the rain sound is nice. I think we're going to keep looking for a projection clock."
1,good idea bad execution,"I received this item as a Christmas gift. It is now March 25, and the item no longer functions. The sound feature will not turn on. I have never been able to get good reception on the radio. The lit dial is very bright, even when you put it on the dim setting. This was money wasted on this product."
4,Great clock.,"I bought this clock about 6 years ago from a Target store. I never was worried about it being wrong or anything. The sounds the clock made were actually pretty relaxing. I used the projector light every once and a while, but it actually broke for some reason a few months after I bought it. That's okay because I cant see far without my glasses anyway. I'd love to see an updated version of this clock, maybe with an automatic time setter, and maybe an iPod dock."
2,Too bright!!,I got this as a gift from work. I hate it!! The soothing sounds are okay but I'm not able to fall asleep because the display light is soooo bright it keeps me awake! I've had it for about four months and I still have to cover the display to go to sleep. Kinda defets the purpose of a clock when it's covered up. The display is so bright I can read by it!
1,The Crazy Alarm Clock!,"This used to work perfectly when we first got it, but now it has a mind of it's own. I cannot get the sounds to turn off. The clock display will only show part of the numbers, or no numbers at all. You push the off button and nothing happens. I can't even set the alarm anymore. LOVE the sounds, just need it to work. Looking for new replacement."
5,Beautiful Sounds from Clock Radio,"Great Sound Machine. Will make you sleep deeper, dream more, and put you to sleep faster. Clock projection is clear and bright. Can light up the room with moonlight effect. Don't drop it. It might malfunction. We dropped it and stop working for a while. We hit it again and it came back to life."
3,Evil in a box,"When on vacation, we realized we had forgotten our daughters white noise machine, we went to a nearby walgreens and this was the only white noise machine choice.The recorded sounds are extremly poor quality. The green numbers in front and the projection are too bright. The lights completely filled the room, it seemed there was no way to escape the surface-of-the-sun-bright lights. We ended up having to throw a big bath towel over it, which dimmed the lights but also drowned the sounds."
1,BOTH completely failed to work!,"I bought one of these (in a store) and once I got it home saw that it would not project the time propertly - only a blue dot on the ceiling. I took it back to exchange it for another one. This time the buttons only worked intermittently, but I finally got it to work... for about 3 hours. Then the front display screen went completely blank, and the projector would only show ""88:88."" This has to be the shoddiest product I've run across in years!"
4,HoMedics SS 4000 Sound Spa Projection Alarm Clock,"I like this clock, works fine,the lighted numbers are a very nice blue shade on the cieling. The lighted numbers on the ceiling are very bright----I would prefer them to be less bright in the bedroom. I do not use the sound spa part of this clock."
5,A SUPERB WAY TO WAKE UP........,"THIS IS ONE DYNAMITE LITTLE CLOCK, ETC. ETC. TO DATE I HAVE PURCHASED 2 OF THEM. ONE FOR EACH OF MY KIDS FOR CHRISTMAS.. THEY BOTH LOVE THEM AND THEY LIKE THAT THE TIME PROJECTS ON THE WALL OR THE CEILING.. THE SOUNDS PUT THEM TO SLEEP AND THEY CAN WAKE UP TO WHATEVER SOUND THEY WANT.. THIS HOMEDICS IS A GREAT LITTLE PRODUCT AND I RECOMMENTHIS ONE FOR ANYONE.."
4,Relaxing way to go to sleep,"I like almost everyting about this clock radio-especially the projected time on the ceiling. I like the choice of sounds and the ease of use.My only complaint is the reception i get on the radio -especially AM.It may be my area, but other radios I've had did better. It would be nice for the next generation to include a CD player."
5,Superb product!,This product has excellent quality for a great price. The sounds are soothing and the wall/ceiling display is great! I would recommend this product to anyone.
4,Helped me sleep well...,"I purchased this clock to help block out road noise on our street. It did the trick. In fact, I slept so well, that I also didn't wake up to my husband's snoring! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the radio reception isn't too good. But I bought it for the nature sounds, so I can live with that issue."
2,Disappointed,"The sound effects are fine as long as the volume is not too high. I hoped the projected time would be something I could see without my glasses while laying in bed, but it was not."
1,Alarm projection time is ALWAYS on.,"Bought this hoping to wake to see time on ceiling, only after alarm went off. However, the projection is not linked to the alarm - it is always on or off. Too bright to sleep with projector on."
2,"Piece of crap, not worth it.","Brought this about 5 days back, just printed a return shipping label.Cons.1> Projection too bad, focus does not help a lot. If you want to project it on wall or ceiling please don't buy it.2> Very hard to tune to a radio station.Pros.1> Variety of sounds or Radio to wake up.Hope the review helped."
1,Horrid,"While the alarm clock works wonderfully, if you are looking for white noise or any noise to drowned out the sound of anything, then this is not the product for you."
2,Disappointed,I bought this clock in March for the projection feature so my husband wouldn't have to sit up to see the clock which is on my side. It worked great in the beginning. Soon I noticed the PM wasn't displaying in the projection then the 1st number stopped displaying so 11:00 displayed as 1:00. Now the second number is out also so the feature I bought it for is useless. I contacted the company and they are willing to replace it but I have to pay to return the broken clock. Don't know if it will be worth it based on other reviews. I wish I had read them first before buying this clock.
1,failed within two weeks!,"Within two weeks the projector lights failed, what is supposed to be a 5:00 looks like 1:73 (three of the led legs failed) It's impossible to actually locate a radio station, there is no LED and the dial is vague at best. The ""ocean"" sounds don't seem to want to play at all! Sadly, it's not worth sending in for repair or replacement... I would have to pay shipping costs and I've already spent too much on something that is not worth anything:("
3,sound machine,"I like having a choice of 6 different sounds to sleep with, but the sounds turn off when the alarm sounds and you use the snooze button. Also there is no way to adjust the brightness of the clock light on the ceiling and it's quite bright."
3,Great all in one product,"Only problem... the projection reads: 88:88 obviosly broken. it was an interesting feature, not enough to go through hastle of returning."
4,Inexpensive solution,"We have sheep that live next to us and when the moms are moved to another field the lambs cry and cry and cry. Now we can listen to a summer rain, or a thunderstorm, or an ocean instead of the cries of the little lambs. Plus when my husband's snoring gets too noisy... This clock was easy to program and the sounds are pleasant and fairly authentic, given it didn't cost a million bucks."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought the product to have something new to sleep by. What a bore...the sound effects are irritating rather than relaxing, especially the beach...the seagulls sound like nails on a chalkboard. I do like the rain, but haven't been able to fall asleep the whole night yet. I went back to a fan. Clock is OK, but I'm used to a double alarm, so that's a little inconvenient. The blue display is annoying - very bright. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,HoMedics SS-4000,"First off, I will start I like the features this device has , the sound affects help with going to sleep as I have constant ringing in my ear. Now the down side is that this is mysecond one, the first one failed out of the box. The projected time did not work correctly half of the lights were out - The company happily exchnaged it. The second one I have has now failed as well, first, half of the lights went out, then a day later, teh whole thing. Something must be wrong with this model. Would not recommend to anyone."
2,good idea but not good enough,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas '06 because she wanted a projection clock with nature sounds. As several other folks have mentioned, the sound clips were way too short and weren't really natural sounding. The waterfall was just white noise. The sounds don't slowly come up to volume either, they are either on or off with the alarm. The part of the clock she liked the best was the ceiling display. Unfortunatly, the clock would gain 5 minutes in the span of two weeks so I returned it to the store Feb 2 07. I'm still curently searching for a suitable replacement that has a projection clock, a cd (to play my own content of waves, birds, etc. from other cd's) and gradually increases the volume."
5,"Fantastic, and not only an alarm clock","It's not just an alarm. We use ours for the nature sounds. You can set it to your favorite nature sound, and leave it on all the time. Or just all night. Another useful feature is the ceiling-projected time. If you wake up in the middle of the night and want to see what time it is all you need do is look at the ceiling.I got mine 2 years ago, and used it for awhile, then my cat knocked it off the nightstand and I found it again a few days ago.I bought it to mask the barking dog next door. It didn't help for that, but finally that neighbor moved.I set it up with the overhead clock projector on, and the STORM sound on. I turned it on and left it on."
2,unusable after six months,"I bought this product about six months ago. It worked okay at first, though I thought it was way too bright. Now, however, it will only play at a very high volume which, of course, isn't soothing at all! I'm going to have to get a new one, but I won't be getting a HoMedics product this time."
1,Projector does not work,"I have owned two of these units, bought from 2 different stores. The first one I purchased lasted only two weeks before the projector broke. It wasn't even as bright as I had hoped for, but it was still passable in this regard until the time when it broke. Thinking that I had just gotten a bad apple, I saw the same unit on sale at a different store a few weeks later and purchased it again. Within 2 weeks, the projector light broke again. Never again will I buy one of these items."
2,Display keeps going out!,"We've owned two of these clocks and purchased one for my father as well. All 3 of the time displays have gone out (not the projection, the actual clock). The noise machines work great, but we have separate alarm clocks since the time display on these goes out after 2-3 weeks. This is a problem HoMedics needs to fix. Don't buy unless you're only planning to use the noise maker."
4,does the job,"This clock works well. I wish the dimmer for the numbers could go lower than the 2 settings it provides, but if a little light doesn't bother you then this is a good alarm clock. The reflection on the ceiling is a cool feature my kids like -- I don't use it much, but it is fun."
1,doing many things badly,"I bought three of these because we liked a previous generation homedics sound machine. Perhaps I had bad luck with faulty returns re-sold, but the clocks didn't keep good time, the sound machine noises added squawking birds to most of the noises and sounds tinny, the overhead display was broken on 2 of 3 out of the box, it is far too easy to accidentally change the time (just 1 button to change hour or minute always active)."
3,"Nice sounds, easy to use, eaasy to change time accidentally","Pros: Nice clock, nice projection, easy to set clock and alarms, decent soundsCons: WAY too easy to accidentally change the time by hitting the wrong button on top."
3,"Okay, but not the best","For the price, this is a pretty cool little machine. I don't really use it radio or alarm, just the sound when traveling. But I have found one problem. It seems to pick up radio reception or maybe it's from my cell phone. Just that occasional screech or buzzing like when you have a cell phone on and you are near a speaker phone. It's loud enough to wake me up. So that's a little counter productive to covering noise. If anyone can tell me how to fix this (other than turn off my cell phone), I'm open to suggestions. Maybe it's the radio that is picking this up."
2,Had to return in,The recording had some annoying ticks in the background on the few sounds I could use to help fall asleep (rain & waterfall). I returned it a few days later.
4,It does what's expected...,"but also has an annoying tendency to amplify some kind of electric signal whenever my cell phone is next to it, and receiving a call, voicemail, text, etc. I have NO IDEA what causes it, but it's enough to jolt you awake when trying to fall asleep (not strong enough to actually wake me from REM sleep though). Anyway, the sounds are great (very peaceful background noises with little/no discernible ""looping"") and very easy to turn on (just press a button and adjust the volume), the laser projects the time clearly on the wall or ceiling, and the alarm is easy to use. As long as you keep it reasonably far from cellular signals, it's a 5 star product."
2,Projector doesn't work,"I was very excited about this product. I do enjoy waking up to the sounds instead of a jangly alarm. The projector worked fine when I first received but before 2 weeks were up, the projector is now stuck on some odd time. The instructions do not provide troubleshooting help. I am very disappointed."
1,Don't bother with this product,"Ordered to use as a clock radio - the nature sounds were a plus. Delivered on a Saturday. Everything worked. Warning - there is no way to tell which radio station you are set on. No visual indicator and the control knob doesn't even tell if you are going up or down the station dial. You just have to listen for each station's call sign. Fell to sleep using the nature sounds. Sunday morning, nothing worked except the clock. No info in user manual; none online at company website. Monday morning - shipped the whole thing back for a full refund."
4,Not bad at all...,"Excellent as far as sound machines go, especially when the price is considered. Projecting blue light time stamp is a little hoaky, but the sounds are good, it works very well, and cost half as much as another we had purchased previously. Overall a good buy."
1,No clear sounds!,"I grew up in Tucson, so I went thru the monsoon season every year so I know EXACTLY what thunder and/or thunderstorms sound like. This product puts what I think is one recorded thunderboom, repeats it over and over in the background while you can hear some kind of static perfectly in the foreground just fine! Even the ocean sounds, good Lord! They have waves coming in and out so fast, you can only think there's a disaster coming, not what I am sure they tried to do, which is a nice sounding pleasant wave coming in,slowly moves out, then another peaceful wave, etc. etc. Do not waste your time on this folks, not even the projected time on your ceiling is very realistic or smart at all. I'm sending mine back today. And so goes the search for a REALISTIC sounding machine that can help me sleep! Hope I helped someone. Cheers. Pamela."
2,I'm just as sleepy as before,"Well, I wish this would've helped me wake up slowly with vim and vigor with all the choices I have but I generally just use the radio like I was doing before with my old alarm clock. I do like how light it is and the shape of the clock but the numbers are a bit bright and I usually just turn it away from me so it won't blare in my face at night. I once slept through the rainforest noises and I think if you're tired enough you'll hit something other than the snooze button so it turns the the whole thing off!"
3,Works well for 4-5 months,"I first bought this product just over a year ago. I really liked it and used it nightly to help me sleep since I'm such a light sleeper. The rain setting was consistent and blocked out other noises. After a number of months, it started to randomly emit a crackle noise that would wake me up. I returned it for another one but after a few months the same thing started happening. Call me crazy, but I decided to give it one more shot (hoping it had just been a bad batch) and it started happening again. Today I returned my third sound spa. I'm disappointed because, though I can use a fan for the noise, this was great for traveling."
3,Time projection light too bright,"Great Clockbut the time projection light is too bright,It is a bright Blue. Needs to have a dimmer switch on it for the projection part."
1,Check a local store first to see if you like it,"I bought this today and am taking it back tomorrow. First of all, there is no way to tell what radio station you are on. There is a dial to change the frequency, but no display showing the station, digital or standard.I could live with the radio part, but the nature sounds were the deal breaker for me. I like the ocean sounds, but I noticed a repeating pattern almost right away. I got out my stop watch and timed it. It's 10 seconds before it starts over."
5,clock,It was a Christmas gift for my wife and she loves it. The sounds are great to go to sleep to!!
4,"time, alarm, sound & more","The Sound Machine was for my daughter who missed the hum of the air conditioner this fall. For the price of a plain ol' clock radio, this had the choice of sounds plus the option to display the time on the ceiling at night. She likes the ""summer sounds,"" but I would not be comfortable with crickets in my bedroom. She can't understand why anyone would choose to listen to thunder. I guess there's something for everyone!"
2,Unhappy with display,"The sounds are nice and the clock is still in my son's room, but the ceiling display went out about six months after we got the clock."
4,Pleased with this!,This is a very nice product. The sounds are very clear and real sounding. The alarm buzzer is awesome... Not obnoxious at all! We love that you can go to sleep using sounds but wake up to something different. My only sad face goes to the fact that we can't use the projected time. The project goes only in two directions - above and back... we would need to point our time forward.
2,Howmedic SS4000,"The device would not work on battery back-up at time of purchase. In the middle of the night it will squell and wake a person up from sleep - kind a the opposite effect your looking for! I called Howmedic and they told me the problem was with interference from an outside source; I guess that explains the battery back-up failure! Customer service at Howmedic was actually a bit confrontational and asked me why I chose to call them and not Amazon; bottom line, they told me to send it back if I was not satisfied. The first good advice they offered!"
2,Meh.,"I got this for Christmas for whatever reason along with my other stuff because I needed an alarm clock for school. ( The uber cheap one I had for 2 weeks literally died. )Pros:Looks pretty nice.Great projection blue light.Adjustable light.Nice bright clear backlight for time.Cons:Never know what radio station you're on.The radio never comes in clear.Super annoying alarm with a continious beep.The sounds don't help you get to sleep.Overall, it's only good if you always look at a clock. Why not get a wrist watch or a cheaper clock? This is thirty dollars down the drain, basically."
4,Great buy!,"Love this product, only one complaint--the display is a bright green/yellow, pretty blaring in a dark room. Other than that, very, very happy!"
3,being honest,"Well, i recently recived this clock. Its relly light weight but it dosent look and feel like somthing worth over 2o dollars. The projection is ok, but i had to go all over my room to find a position that will show the projection in a good angle. The sound quality is nice for the size. The element sounds are not bad, but its not great either, dont expect to feel like your actually next to a waterfall. The machine is very easy to configure so theres no problems there. So overall, i think the clock is ok, but should have been sold for fifteen dollars."
2,No big thing,"Regardless of the fact that the projection button was broken and I had to return it anyway, I wasn't impressed with this clock at all. I found it cheaply made and unsubstantial. I ended up with the Timex clock that although the sounds aren't fabulous, I'm delighted with all the other features."
2,Not all that great,You have the options of 6 relaxation sounds. The reflective time on the wall or ceiling is difficult to really see & position so you can actually read it without turning yourself upside down. The buttons along the front of the clock are super sensitive & you can accedently change the time really easy.
4,Great sounds!,"I bought this product because I was looking for a relatively inexpensive sound machine to block neighborhood noise. I am very pleased with the sounds - especially the rain. It is soothing and really blocks the noise. It has made a world of difference - I am finally able to sleep through the night!I do agree with other reviewers who have commented on the bright blue light. However, I use another alarm clock for waking and put this one on the other side of the room so it doesn't bother me."
1,"Terrible, Terrible","I am returning the Sound Spa because it seems to pick upCB and cell phone signals. Instead of hearing ""Ocean waves"" youhear beeps.This is the first time I have had a disappointing experience with Amazon.I would not recommend purchasing this item."
5,Pleasant,"This product is great! It is easy to set up to the selections that work best for you. I personally don't want to view the time on my ceiling so I turned that projection to off. I set my alarm to wake up to a rain forest with beautiful bird sounds. Now my mornings start in a pleasant, peaceful way."
1,Disappointing - Display stopped working in less than a month,"The sounds are all a lot of fun - waterfall, rainforest, beach etc. The beach seagull calls repeat too quickly. The sound loop is a little short.The radio sound is not very clear.The overhead projection is a little too bright for sleeping, upside down on the ceiling and a little fuzzy. I worry about having to change the bulb in it.The really bad part was that the display stopped working correctly in less than a month - the last digit is now permanently displaying a number 8. So it's impossible to tell if the time is 12:00, 12:01 or 12:09. You can be off by 9, almost 10 minutes.Very light-weight and flimsy construction. Does not feel solid."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed by this alarm clock. I will say that I liked the projection feature very much. The natural sounds were ok except the thunderstorm. That was the sound I wanted to hear the most, but the thunder rumbled constantly and seemed very unnatural. It seems like the sound clips are very short in duration and I was able to memorize the sound of the rain within a couple of minutes. Also, the alarm clock was not userfriendly in my opinion. Buttons were too close and I ended up changing the actual time more than once. I will be returning it today."
2,Sound Spa Clock/Radio,When I first received the machine I loved it. It was easy to set and understand how to use. After the 1st couple of months the sound machine part would make this awful loud noise when it was playing. I would be in a dead sleep and this loud noise would wake me up. It was horrible. I don't know if it was interference from something else or what-it was the middle of the night. I don't recommend this product if you are getting it strictly for the sound spa.
3,It's ok,"So far, I have yet to see one of these projection clocks that projects with great clarity, this one is no exception. It does the job but, the projection is only so so. All I want is projection clarity - the rest of the clock doesn't even matter to me so for my purposes, I use it but, if it wasn't such a hassle I would send it back for a refund..."
3,Excellent for sound therapy- but alarm stopped working for no reason,"I love the sounds on this clock- I tried another brand after this one, but this one really has the most soothing sounds. The ergonomics of the product were great.However, about a year after I bought it, the alarm function suddenly and myseriously stoped working.So, although I love the sounds, I will not buy another clock like this...."
1,Improperly Shielded,"If you have any wireless devices in the home (802.11b/g network, baby monitor, even a microwave) the clock will make an awful interference noise.As this was for baby's room, this was clearly unacceptable."
2,Not Reliable,"Had it for about three weeks and then, projection light kaput! To have repaired under warranty the consumer must ship it back (at your expense) to Homedics and include a check for $5.00 to cover shipping and handling. That amounts to almost half the purchase price! When it worked, I liked it. But the lousy customer/warranty service (still waiting for it back after a month) I would not buy a another product from Homedics."
2,HoMedics ss-4000 Spa Deluxe Clock-Junk!!,Let's see where to begin..... The time projection feature lasted just 24 hours. Now it displays on the wall very fragmented so you cannot make out the time at all. This was the cool feature we thought the boys would just love!!My boys are older & share a room so they are careful w/ electronics. The alarm/radio is just like any other.Don't buy this clock for the projection feature..save your money!HoMedics Sound SPA Premier Sound Machine Clock Radio with Atomic & Indoor/Outdoor Temperature
1,Piece of junk!,"I really don't like wasting money and that's what happened when I purchased this. It's for my baby's room and the thing stopped working. It stops in the middle of the night at first and now it only goes for about 2 hours and then turns itself off. It's not supposed to do this. There is a timer you can set or just leave it a at a constant on. Doesn't work anymore. Plus, sometimes the lights come on, sometimes they don't. It didn't pay to go 'cheap'. Sometimes you get what you pay for. :-("
3,Not A Bad Clock,This product is good but it is very limited on the amount of different sounds it can produce. The blue light that projects onto the ceiling is a little freaky but cool.
3,Great for white noise,"Overall, it's an OK alarm clock. If you're buying it for the projection feature, don't. It doesn't last long. We have two of them, and while our original one lasted longer, the projection started to fade after time, and now you can barely see it on the ceiling. The second one pretty much broke within a few months. Otherwise, I will agree with the others that it is bright, so I wasn't too disappointed to turn it off anyway. It was nifty at first.The nature sounds are decent and my husband has his set to his alarm. I like it because it's soft enough (provided he doesn't turn the volume up in a half sleep) that it doesn't wake me, but is still able to get him up.It's not the best quality, but it works for what we use it for. However, you can get other clock radios with white noise sounds for less."
4,Better than I expected,"This product has more features than I was looking for, but I really like them all and have found it to be an easy to use, helpful tool. My son liked it too, so we bought another one. Alarm sounds can be soft or loud enough to wake a teenager. Snooze button is easy to use and the alarm is easy to set. I also appreciate not having to re-set it every night unless I want to change the wake up time. Projection of time on ceiling is very helpful in the middle of the night. If that is too bright for you, it can be turned off."
2,"Uhh, great clock...if it kept time","My wife and I received this clock off our wedding registry. The projection on the ceiling works great and the soothing sounds are exactly what we wanted...except it doesn't keep time. It is SLOW. We tried unplugging it and resetting it numerous times and there is NO hope. Perhaps it is just this particular one, but it's a worthless clock without the ability to keep time."
3,It works...,I have owned this for a couple of years and its fine. I am actually not too fond of its alarm set up but it works well and the sounds can be soothing. I bought this as a gift and the recipient seems to like it. Nothing will ever truly replace the rain music CD I used to own though - that was the best for sleeping!
4,Cool clock,"Cool clock.I enjoy it and use it all the time.The Pro's:The shape, size, display, being able to put the clock display up on the cieling...all that.The Con's:The Thunder sound clip doesnt really sound good, and in general all the clips are really short before they repeat themselves...but..ehhh,for the price...wadda ya gonna do."
2,Could be improved,Cons:LED lights are too bright. I bought this because I have trouble getting to sleep and I had to put electric tape over the LEDs because they kept me up.The wave noise is too fast and the sea bid sound is too frequent.The thunder sound is also too fast. I don't find these relaxing.The waterfall sounds like nothing at all. A babbling brook would have been better.The buttons to change the time are a poor design. I keep messing up the time by accident. You should have to hold down two buttons to change the time.Pros:Inexpensive and multi-functionalI thought 3 of the six sounds were good at any rate.
1,bzzzzzzz,"Going to sleep hearing the sound of a waterfall is great, waking up to a buzzing noise two hours later is not. After having this clock for two weeks it stopped working through the night."
3,OK while it lasted,"This is a good entry-level sound machine, but don't expect amazing quality. The projection time was great, but only lasted about 3 or 4 months and then stopped functioning. It just forecasts 88:88.The sounds are OK, but fairly repetitive / ""low budget"". If you are interested in a sound machine, I'd recommend checking out the Brookstone line. I just upgraded to the Brookstone travel alarm tranquil moments sound machine. The sound quality is much improved. There is no projection on that clock, but then again, there isn't on my version of this product anymore, either.The other product is easier to travel with. I will take when staying in a hotel to avoid hearing lots of outside noises."
2,it might have been a nice unit,"I originally bought this as a gift thinking it would be great to have a small LCD TV for my husband's desk and a portable DVD player for traveling. Problem is they no longer make the ""optional battery pack"" as advertized so it really isn't portable. You could get a better quality LCD TV for a lot less then this unit which doesn't do as Toshiba claims"
4,I love Aaron Carter,"I love Aaron Carter and I still do, Um I gave this a 4. I would give him a 5 if he didn't sound like a girl in this song. I love the song Crush on you. But his voice is kind of weird, but people buy this cd it is good. Crush on you is a good song. I love Aaron eventhough he is kind of getting old now, but who cares. He is still singing."
1,What???,"What kid sings about girls at 10yrs?? All them girls givin' awesome reviews probily think his music stinks, but just wast money cause hes cute or they dont want to hurt his feelings. This kid has the voice of a girl!! I herd this song on the radio. At first I thought it was some girl trying to be Britney Spears,but at the end the told you it was Aaron Carter. My friend started telling me to be nice and that is music is awesome, but we all know the truth!! I guess we'll just have to wait for his new album?"
2,A Truley ethical hunter from the word go.,Richard Smith is a true hunter with excellent ethics. His book is great for the beginning hunter. However its is full of endorsements from the beginning.I gave this book to a friend to read before I would even hunt with him for the first time. Hats off to you Richard for allowing so many deer to pass you by and let them become future trophies. I only wish others people would enjoy the outdoors as much and not think of the sport as a chance to shoot at the first deer that comes by. I would be honored if I ever got the chance to hunt with you
2,To elementary for most hunters,This book is by far the simplest book I've ever read for a deer hunting book. It lacks sophisticated detail and has a flavor for the bare basics. I strongly encourage hunters to steer clear of this book if they have any exprience at all. I give it 2 stars (instead of 1) for the beginner who actually may find this somewhat useful. Otherwise don't waste any time reading this.
2,I've seen better,"This book to me did not explain certain things so well and I would have to ask others how to do them. I did not like the books approach at all. But the book definitely told you how to open the programs up. Ex:Go to start and click all programs, then click word.If you don't know how to do that, you are in big trouble because this book in depth detail in all the different office applications."
3,Not what I expected,"It is not the seller's fault, but I failed to read all the fine print. The quotes are sorted by author and I wanted them sorted by topic."
1,This is NOT the show described!!,"This is NOT the production described above. The one that is described was an excellent dramatic account of the history of the Borgias with Adolfo Celi, Oliver Cotton and Anne-Louise Lambert, directed by Brian Farnham. The mini-series was shown on A&E years ago and I have been searching for it on video or DVD ever since. I was very excited to find it here and I immediately ordered it. After waiting and waiting and waiting, with many notices that it was delayed, I FINALLY received it. I put it in the VCR last night and imagine my dissappointment to find out that I had spent $37 (plus tax) for a 50 minute ""In Search of History"" episode. No Adolfo, no Oliver and no Anne-Louise, just a bunch of ""experts"" talking about the life of the Borgias and then a bunch of pictures of portraits while the narrator fills us in on the history. I'm not only dissappointed but I feel duped -- and I STILL want to find a copy of that mini-series!"
1,Do not buy this item - it is not the BBC series,I also bought this and it is not what is described above.Do not buy this - you will not get the BBC series!
5,Outstanding advanced collection of modeling ideas,"This is still my favorite book on mathematical modeling. The material is well-suited to a mature graduate audience in applied mathematics, but some of the ideas can be fed into an undergraduate class as well. What I really like about this book is the variety of novel models of real-world systems which I don't see elsewhere. Traffic modeling is discussed here with more realism than I've seen in other texts. This book is not an easy read, but very rewarding to those who persevere."
5,Essential for young people,"I studied abroad in Paris before I bought this book and must say that I felt a little clueless on where all the cool bars and clubs were. I wish I would have had this book from the beginning. It gives great advice on where to stay and meet people, which is not always easy to figure out in a big city. This book will help you get beyond the boring touristy stuff and help you get the most out of your european vacation."
3,A very good book - although a bit outdated,"For anyone involved in advertising of MarCom this book gives very practical advice. Overall very impressive and a good read for anyone involved in sales, advertising or marketing functions. Somehow contents required update and technologies have impacted this so much. Another book I highly recommended is 60-Minute Brand Strategist by Idris Mootee. This book is LOADED with solid, meaty real world branding insights and techniques that can are being kept as trade secrets. You will probably find this book a real eye opener. If you're looking for a more balanced marketing book, suggest going for David Aaker's books, some Kotler's books."
3,Online resource hobbled ...,"This hard cover text book is an excellent resource for the practicing pathologist. The online text was great until January, 2011, when Lippincott took down what was an excellent, fast and efficient, online resource and replaced it with a miserably restricted version, which seems like a limited version of Amazon's ""Click to Look Inside"" function. The online reference text now displays just page by page. It can no longer be scrolled or printed. It can be searched, but its rudimentary search function merely returns a list (10 entries at a time) of every page on which the word appears, along with a 5-6 word sentence fragment for context (no chapter or section title). From that minimal information, I cannot figure out which is the pertinent entry for my query. It's faster for me to get up, get the printed text book off the library shelf, and look it up there."
5,Excellent,"It was a fast delivery, and the book arrived in excellent condition. Its an excellent book for all the benign and malignant lymph node pathologies. One don't need any other book for review. Its a complete review with good pictures."
1,Preventing and treating colic in your horse,"Pervention and treatment of Colic in your horse(EC) is a real rip off, I expected a book, not a $1. reprint from an extension office. This joker sold this for 5.00 and charged 3.99, it came with a .42 stamp. I paid $9.00 for what? I thought Amazon.com put you in touch with real book dealers, not rip off artists."
3,Adequate but Not for the Advanced Student,"While this book does indeed contain pages of vocabulary words, expressions and verbs presented in a thematic format the words offered are elementary, not advanced or specific enough for a speaker who wants more nuanced vocabulary for more detailed conversations or writing.For the beginning French student, I would think that this book could be a god-send, once your writing or conversational topic is decided upon, all you need on a basic level is included---no need to constantly refer back and forth to a dictionary.Recommended to beginning French language enthusiasts only."
4,Straight-forward and concise but lacking a couple features,"This book is great for learning new vocabulary however I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I think it could be improved with a couple features currently missing. It could use a directory in English as well as French rather than just in French and I think tests at the end of each section would be useful in learning. Otherwise, great book, I love it."
4,handy access to important words and phrases,I found this book very useful because it covered the most common french words and phrase by related catagories. A good way to inter-relate concepts.
3,Love the shelf but....,"The packaging was great, nothing was damaged and the box wasn't torn in any way. The shelf was a pain to put together. The instructions are just a couple pictures-which is fine, I had no problem figuring it out after I studied it for awhile. I had to screw each screw into every hole on every piece of the shelf before I could put it together because the holes were to small and the screws kept going in sideway. I was also short 3 covers that hide the screw. After I finally got it together, I was very happy with the way it looked in my livingroom and I really enjoy it so it was worth the hassle."
3,good deal,"much better than reviews, everything lined up fine and no messy asembly issuesvery good for little odds and ends"
4,Frame,It was very easy to put together. It works very well and can put a lot of things on it. Love that the shelves are at different widths so I can store a variety of objects on it.
2,split wood,This bookshelf was easy to assemble but one of the shelves had a knot in the wood where the screw goes and split the wood. I hate returning large items that can't go back into the box so a little Gorilla glue and some left over dark stain and filling it with stuff and you can't see it. I won't buy another one.
1,Bookcase,The first order went missing during transit. I had to request a replacement order. I should have just cancelled the order. The quality of this product is terrible. The wood stain has streaks and areas where it is not smooth. Very poor workmanship. The screws are too big for the holes. I was unable to assemble this myself because I was not strong enough to make them fit into the existing holes. I usually am able to do all my own assembly of products that I purchase. It is highly unlikely that I would buy another product from this manufacturer.
3,Not too good,Well I liked the piece cause it fits perfectly where I wanted to put it but one of the shelves had a big scratch and it took for ever to get to my house
4,great shelf,"We had a two foot wide section of a wall that we needed to fill in our baby's room and this worked great for us! The construction was fairly simple. The wood felt sturdy and strong. We purchased it on amazon at 45% off, so definitely for the price it's hard to beat."
3,A bit too small,"I had in mind a bigger shelving unit that would take up more space. Instead it covered about 1/2 of the space I wanted it to and it didn't go up as high as I thought it would. I know the dimensions were stated but its one of those things you don't know until you put it in the space. The shelves are not very deep, if you looking for something with deep shelves and that leans against the wall this is not the unit you are looking for. For the money, I would say it's a good buy. This product was easy to put together and is quite sturdy. I kept the product and it holds all of my movies and PS3 games and console. For that I gave it 3 stars."
1,Poor quality finish & flimsy,"Not good....I have bought several 'flat pack' items, many of far east country origin, this shelf unit is bar far the worst. Shipping boxes thin and will likely have damage on receipt (both of mine had severed taping and torn cardboard, which led to chipping of contents. But worst was very poor finishing of wood prior to stain being applied ,appears as though nothing was sanded or cleaned before finish was applied....rough to the touch and inconsistant color, would have been better just going to B*g L**s. Had to saw a piece in each box to fit (the strengthener under the bottom shelf). If boxes were intact enough I would return product. I would not put much weight on it as shelves only thin."
1,Winsome A-frame shelf,"Too bad! Nice product for the money if you don't mind doing the job for the company you paid to deliver. The manufacturer seems not to have quality control. One of the shelves had no holes whatsoever. Four drilled holes in each shelf are essential in the assembly of this product. It was either take the time and expense to return the product, drill the holes myself, or use the faulty shelf and take a chance on the shelf eventually falling. My time is too valuable to do the job for a company I've paid for their product. In business as in life, you have one chance to make a first impression. My advice to the buyer, be prepared for frustration - Winsome doesn't check components before shipping and leaves the quality control to the customer. Too bad for the customer!"
1,"Cheap materials, lopsided","Very cheaply made. Wood has multiple scratches. The wooden pegs require a hammer to insert, and even then the edges easily crack when you are hammering in the wooden peg. The wooden pegs don't even fit snugly. I've built several items, from ikea sets to office desks. And this ended up coming out tilted. Horribly designed.I would return the item, but now I can't even take it apart. Complete waste of $59. Deserves 0 stars."
4,We like it,"After debating a long time about this unit due to the 1 star reviews, I went ahead and ordered it because it seemed to be just the right size for our bedroom. Most of the ladder/leaning type shelves are very tall, and we wanted to set a 20-inch TV on it and not be craning our necks to watch it. This bookshelf was super easy and quick to assemble. The quality is reflective of the price but it does look nice. There was only one tiny nick on a shelf that we were able to face down so it doesn't show. The finish is quite dark but I disagree with those who say it looks black. You can definitely see that it is brown. The height works well and the lower shelves will look great with some baskets to store DVDs, etc. FYI, the top shelf is narrow but we were still able to place the TV on it because it is a lightweight LCD that is very thin. You could never put something heavy on these shelves, at least not on the upper two. Bottom line, I'm glad I ordered this."
1,Jury Still Out,"The front shocks work great. The rear shocks act like solid steel. I might change my review if I learn how to resolve this problem. My car jumps like a bucking bronco over every significant bump or dip. I am trying to find if there is some adjustment that I failed to do but so far getting info is like getting teeth pulled. I still hold out hope that it is some adjustment and not just a very poor product. Also, if Gabriel sold this as an all-in-one product like they do for most other cars, I probably would not be having this terrible problem. Does anyone know more about this? Contact me over at larrymuse.com if you have suggestions. Thanks, Larry"
5,Great teething and reward toy,My mini poodle puppy loves this toy. It can be filled with all sorts of things which increases the longevity for the toy as you can change it up when he gets a bit bored. It is great for teething and comfort.
5,Amazing Toy,I love my dog's Kong. It keeps them occupied for hours. Put some peanut butter in it before i leave and i know the dogs whill be occupied for a while.
1,Decomposing,After just two days of use the rubber started to break down and get sticky. Not very well made I only wish I could give it zero stars.
2,"Kongs are overrated, says puppy...","Frankly I don't understand the hype about these toys. I get that they're practically indestructible & you can put stuff inside them. But my puppy has shown no interest in this thing at all even though he loves chewing on practically everything. We tried putting stuff inside, and he successfully licked it out in about 5 minutes, but no chewing occurred. This & the nylabone seem like things humans want their dogs to like more than things dogs actually DO like. oh well.FYI: this puppy version is significantly softer than the adult version so probably better to stick with this for a puppy. (still seems pretty indestructible)"
4,Good toy,"Our lab hated his when he was a puppy. Was a waste of money. However, our mini Aussie loves it! We put treats in it and it keeps him busy."
5,This was a gift,A friend collects & uses these every year on her Christmas tree. She didn't have this one & was real excited.
3,too much cross reference needed in use,"While this map itself is full of detail, it's not as user friendly as we had hoped. The maps are not broken down by individual towns, but rather by regions. The street listing is in the back of the book and, again, not broken down by town (ie, many multiple street listings). Also, there is not a good ""overview"" map that allows you to see towns in relation to one another without the street detail. The atlas serves its purpose, but is not one you can use for quick and easy reference (say while driving). I would recommend the same product by Arrow or Hagstrom for much easier use."
4,worn book but invaluable,"the item i received was a book currently out of print so, used is the only option. mine had water damage and prety serious yellowing but still an invaluable book for looking up Hawaiian words, names and phrases. you have the option to start with the english word or the hawaiian one so it is soooo easy to use. some words not found since it is such an old print. don't look for the word 'computer' for instance( ha ha!). Great for travelers or to use as a code word book. Aloha Kakahiaka!"
5,Story of the Heart,"There is a certain comfort and connection which results from sharing our joys, sorrows, and struggles, and this book was like finding a light in the darkness. In the complexity of our busy lives and scattered minds, we forget the power of simple attention. Attention and sensitivity allowed the author to hear what it is her mother wanted and needed. I would like to think I'll be a more attentive daughter having read ""do i know you?"""
5,EVERYTHING YOU COULD WANT IN A BOOK,"THIS A TRULY WONDERFUL BOOK, ABOUT AN AMAZING WOMAN.THE AUTHOR DELIVERS A GREAT STORY.THIS IS ONE YOU SHOULD NOT MISS. WELL WRITTEN AND TOUCHES THE HEART.DON'T MISS THIS ONE!!"
3,Are you sure this is Official?,"I was genuinely surprised to open this relatively inexpensive title to find beautiful full color shots with thick, glossy pages. But I was more so disappointed when if found the first 30 pages a rehash of the instructions and online help that comes with the game, and to see that the meat of the book was just maps and virtually no strategy. I feel that the main reason for such a guide is to provide the best battle stratgies on dealing with enemies, not just simply list what enemies there are to be found and the recommended characters to use. The greatest features of this guide, though, are the comprehensive lists of jobs, enemies, and useful and equippable items. I like the fact that this book, despite its pre-game release, covered in full the American version of Final Fantasy Tactics, but it turned out to be more of an FAQ than anything."
5,Great,I got the stratagy guide almost the earliest day possible. I hope to do business with this person in the future.
5,Final Fantasy Tactics,"Tactics is one of my favorite games, not at all like the other Final Fantasy RPG setup, it's Tactics so theres a square map and your team takes turns attacking random maps and boss maps. This is awesome. Great story line."
3,Missing sections,The guide covered most of the game but several sections were missing. The game had many secrets and most are revealed in the guide.
4,Finding rare items,"The book is great if you are an easy reader but the book is not that accurate on the move-find item movement ability it just gives you a set of coordinates and then you have to find the spot yourself, they could have included a graph of the map with grids that have been labeled with the coordinates."
5,Great Poetical mindz think alike,"Love Pending is a must have poetry book. I have been reading Amberly's poetry for years and what can I say except, if you haven't copped this..you must be sleeping.Keep the pen moving Amber.."
4,Good album from Daz,"Daz' first full album in almost 2 years is not his best but still a good album. All the production was done by Daz and Mike Dean of Rap-A-Lot so you know right there it's going to have good production. Has 1 classic a few great songs and 2 or 3 that I skip. Track 12 has 2 very good bonus tracks after it so keep listening. It features a few others on here as well. A must have album for his fans to have.#2 - 7.5#3 - 8 (good beat -- f/ PFN)#4 - 8 (f/ Too $hort -- dirty song)#5 - 8.5 (good beat)#6 - 6.5 (slower song)#7 - 10 (classic w/ a great beat -- f/ Tanya Herron -- original version is Kurupt's w/ the same beat)#8 - 7#9 - 7.5 (uses same verses he has on the classic ""Crippin'"" off C-Bo's ""Enemy of the State"")#10 - 4.5 (has a rock beat)#11 - 6#12 (1st bouns song) -- 9 (upbeat song f/ Kurupt & Roscoe)#12 (2nd bonus song) -- 9.5 (deep song f/ Kurupt)Delmar Arnaud -- b. 5/25/73 -- Long Beach, CAcheck all my reviews"
5,Wish I had bought 2 of these!,"'Santa' brought this for our 5 year old last year...the only problem is - I wish we had 2 of these! Our 3 year old can now ride it easily with training wheels so they fight over it quite a bit. Over the summer our 5 year old was able to take the training wheels off and ride 2-wheeled. So this must definitely be a great training bike! We are often taking the training wheels off and then back on again between who's riding it, and it's holding up very well after a year of 2 rough boys riding on it. Highly recommend this to any little Transformer fans out there that need a training bike."
3,A bike your kid will like but limited quality for the price,"My 5 year old son likes his new bike because it is a Transformer bike. However, he does get frustrated by it's weight sometimes, especially trying to go up an incline. And I get frustrated because his seat is constantly crooked, and I can't seem to tighten it enough to make that stop happening. All in all, I would say buy this bike if your kid is really into Transformers, but otherwise you are probably better off with something a bit better built."
3,"Nice looking bike, but abit heavy","The kids like this bike but the training wheels are not made that good and wore out very quickly. The bike is also very heavy for a 16"" bike and my son had to use his older brothers old 16"" while learning how to ride it without the training wheels. A lighter bike is just easier to handle from him.I wish they made bikes more practical little kids these days....."
2,Not as good as advertised,I bought the Bore Sighter to sight my .22 rifle. The laser works fine but the caliber adaptors don't hold the sighter firmly in the barrel. The result is that the laser moves and makes it extremely difficult to sight the gun.
4,This book is still in print in the U.K.,"This book, and many others by this author are available from Pallas Armata in the U.K. Email Gareth_Simon@Londonelec.co.uk for details."
4,Absolutely great product,"I found the Dark Tournament saga, was a great way to continue from Spirit Detective boxset, where Urameshi and friends get forced in to battles against other teams. The only reason I gave this 4 out of 5 is because the Special Features don't change much, apart from the details about the characters in each disk."
2,Lame,Its very boring and unrealistic. You baciscally got to be tripin balls to get the point. its wird that the grim reeper would be a perky up beat girl that rides a padle. The hero is a greasy street punk with wird hair. Basically the only reason i gave in two stars is because sometimes they say funny things. If your a little kid you might like it but if your older you might want to expand your horizons.
4,Swinging,"This guy knows how to swing. The album as a whole has a nice feel to it, although there is quite a bit of r&b rather than straight-ahead jazz happening here. Nonetheless, Mr. Mahogany sounds great. His phrasing is tasty, his scat hard-swinging. And check out Peter Bernstein on guitar...whoa- his solos to this observer dominate the set. Highly recommended for those not-yet-familiar with Kevin Mahogany."
4,Terrific blend of R&B and Blues,"This album show Mahogany's great vocal style. He covers some classic tunes and makes it clear that he really can swing. Mahogany is also particulary adept at ballads; his cover of ""When October goes"" is outstanding.The supporting musicians are also excellent. The sax and drummer are particularly good."
1,"Selective, typical Liberal analysis","Includes the claim that noone knows how many communists there were in the government and then goes on to say that the number was exaggerated! But oh how awful it was to go through the depression. . . as though that justified being a communist, joining the government and turning over secrets to them! We don't know the exact number but McCarthy was RIGHT about there probably being hundreds, including the famed Alger Hiss, who were anti-Americans helping the enemy. I wonder if anything has changed since then and the liberal, anti-Americans of today?Johnsons shows the typical leftist emotional intelligence (no logic needed) of today's elite media who find no need to tell truth!One wanting to know the truth about the Communist infiltration with FDR administration, one could much more profitably readSam Tanenhaus' WHITAKER CHAMBERS."
1,The Occult Anatomy of Man,"I am not sure how many people do not realize that this author was a freemason whose goal was a one world government and so,, his teachings are SATANIC... the Occult is Satanism.. And in case you do not know this, hell is not a good place.. and btw God WINS. Do NOT believe the SAME lies satan told Eve in the Garden of Eden,, men CANNOT be gods and they cannot live forever.. except through Jesus Christ, not the antichrist.Satan LIES"
4,Rexroth's Favorite Poet,"After having difficulty understanding many of these poems I turned to the literary criticism and read a long article by Kenneth Rexroth praising Durrell as the great poet of the twentieth century. Durrell who was a first- rate writer of travel books, and his most known today for the great series of novels 'The Alexandria Quartet' began his career as a poet. In the course of his wanderings as a British Civil Servant, a soldier a writer who knew and wrote of many places. In these poems he writes of Greece and Rhodes and Paris and Egypt and Venice and the Paris and Avignon and Britain. He is a poet of the Mediterranean and of Greek mythology. And his poems are written in a complex difficult vocabulary. They are hard intellectual work though Rexroth feels they have an especially beautiful music. I had difficulty reading them and feeling them deeply."
5,Jensen P10R's are awesome! Definitely recommended.,"These speakers are installed stock in my Laney Lionheart L20T-410. It's taken about 1 week of playing semi-loudly to get them to break in, but now that they are I can see why Laney chose these over all the other available brands. The cleans are crisp and sweet, mids cut through really nicely and have that 'woody' tone, and there's just enough low end to give the overall tone some balls.I read a few different bad reviews about these, and honestly, I don't know what the hell the people that give these a bad rap are playing through or what kind of tone they've 'dialed in'. These speakers are 10"" monsters of great classic '70's, dirty guitar tone.BTW: I play standard 440E tuned Sabbath/clutch/Kyuss style 'stoner rock', and these speakers really work well for that classic '70's dirty tone. I couldn't be happier. :-)"
4,Guitar Wolf - 'Missle Me!' (Matador) 4 1/2 stars,"Wow! The minute I was listening to the third track here, I simply KNEW it was for me. Couldn't get enough of the title cut ""Missle Me!"", ""Hurricane Rock"", the brutal ""Can Nana Fever"", the awesome rocker ""Racing Rock"" and the S-L-A-M-M-I-N-G ""Venus Drive"", Now, is it JUST me or is 'Missle Me!' have Guitar Wolf trying to resemble the MC5? This title might be tough to find - unless you're willing to throw out some serious ca$h. Highly recommended."
2,Not too cool,"Bought this wrap in order to nurse a sore knee with a sub-surgical tear. Frankly, the item is rather bulky and ill fits in the freezer. at first I thought it took way too long to get cold enough, then I realized that it just does not get that cold, no matter how long it stays in the freezer. For the money and the results, you are better off putting up with the mess and wetness of wrapping ice in a towel, or any of the gel bags that are in the market. I gave it two stars because the item has a handy way of tying it to the body, but, nothing else works for me about it."
1,Agree with everyone else,I have this chair for over 2 years and i admit that it's been in my bedroom just for decoration after the very 1st week of use. I agree with everyone else who said it more vibrates than massages...
2,Never use Super Saver Shipping again,"I placed the order in Dec 30, 2004 using Super Saver Shipping for my wife's pain on the back. The price for this item is $52.67 with a $20 gift card. I have not received the item yet(Jan 27) and I found the delivery date was postponed from January to April. Then I still have to use other shipping options with almost one month delay."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I had purchased several larger full matt size ten motor HoMedic massagers in the past and they were fine for a short while, however after several months their vibrator motors gave out one by one. I see that particular model is no longer available through Amazon. Even though that previous larger model is no longer available, most likely because of the above mentioned reliablity issues, it was so much better than this one in every way. This unit is a piece of junk right out of the box. The vibration is very weak and two of the motors make such a loud buzzing sound that you can hardly hear the TV over the racket. Also the hard vibrators are very uncomfortable on your back."
2,....,"there are a few bad points to this massager: its pretty loud, sounds like someone is playing really loud bass right outside your window....the motors are in the perfect spot to press directly on your spine, they should have put them off to the side a little....the straps dont reach around a recliner, i guess you're supposed to sit at a dining room chair to use it(havent tried it in the car yet)....the heat doesnt get very hot.....besides all those points its good."
1,terrible,"purchased this for my son for Christmas. I am returning it. It does not massage at all, all it does is vibrate. My son said all the vibrating made him sick.A waste of time and money."
1,BOO!!,"I got this for my wife. Very disappointed, just vibrates it is not a massager. She also complains that it makes her sick to her stomache, and she gets a headache if she uses it for more then 5 minutes at a time."
2,not worth the money,This product is just like any other chair massager. NOTHING SPECIAL about it. It does the same sh.. as any other competitor. I would not even pay $40 for this item. HoMedics is not all that. I ordered this item because of the promotional certificate.
2,Not what I expected.,"The item is more a vibrator than a massager. The heat is not adjustable and is less than satisfactory (too low).I use it just because my husband feels better when I do.I would not buy it again, given the opportunity."
3,Not impressed.,I have had this for about a year and already one of the cords has had to be replaced/rewired because the control came off. The cords are also short so you can't move more than a couple of feet away from the plug-in.
3,"Love the action, Hate the quality","I purchased this Rod knowing that Ugly stik is a great action Rod, I was right! unfortunately after a couple of months of use in salt water the (Chrome) guides started to rust. They rusted so badly that the guides just started to fall apart. such a shame. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Moog ES2374 Steering Center Link Tie Rod End,I have buy this Tie rod end for my dad toyota pick-up 1996 and it's fit smooth and working excellent so I recommend this product
1,no album notes,"came without album linear notes... just the jewel case , cd, and back case art. Wasnt noted in description that this was missing"
4,Another decent collection.,"This is pretty much an update of his ""Greatest Hits"", which for some reason is now out of print. It's roughly what that was, but adds a few more covers, and removes his duet with ""Michael Bolton"", among others. The big addition here for some may be his cover of Celine Dions ""My Heart Will Go On"". I actually think I like the ""Greatest Hits"" more though, and I'll say if you have that, you don't really need this. But again, both are similar, and both have his own most popular songs. Hopefully people can start spending less time on categorizing him, and more time enjoying the music."
1,Jazz for the Musically Impaired,"In 1999 I went to a wedding and the best man forgot to bring his CD collection. My cousin had a Kenny G CD in his car, so this is what played for 3 hours during the reception. After that incident 5 years ago I learned how obnoxious an instrumental album could be. The sound of this little bleating sax sounds like an electic kazoo. Whats even more irritating is that it sounds as though this guy (I think its a guy) never takes a breath! I think he uses an air compressor in the studio to play this thing. We hear a series of notes that NEVER lets up! This is jazz? This is a CD to cringe to. Musically sterile, totally uncreative and irritating to listen to. Kenny G is all hype and promotion with little more talent than a high school band player."
4,"Not his ultimate, but okay.","People who may know jazz better than I do might hate me for this, but I think Kenny G is a terrific instrumentalist. He may not be the purist jazz musician out there, but what he does with his instrument is just amazing. He can reach high notes with such accuracy and speed. Overall, as an instrumentalist, not a jazz musician, he deserves 5 stars. I mean this guy is a grammy award winner, he deserves at least some respect for that.Enough with that, now I am going to discuss this album. My favorite song in this album is Everlasting, which made me feel warm inside and I also enjoyed Brazil and his rendition of My Heart Will Go On and We've Saved the Best for Last. Of course you can't forget his Grammy Winner Forever in Love and his #1 hit, Songbird."
5,Great way to start a day!,I love his work. And this CD is no different. It's one CD I would recommend to everyone who like listening to Jazz while driving. It never fails to sooth the nerve on a long drive.
1,Miles Davis is Rolling over in his grave,"To even put this sissy in the same sentence as mile davis yet alone other real jazz artists is and insult to jazz and i am sorry. He does not even play like a real sax he plays that one that looks like a flute. Frank Sintra was right though calling him the chick with a flute. Also, if you want double tourture for your money check out his duet with Michael Bolton."
1,Spit! Rinse! Spit! Rinse!,"Shame on the following individuals:1) Kenny G.2) Kenny G. fans3) People who ""play"" saxophone like Kenny G.4) People who look like Kenny G.5) Dentists who play his music6) Artists who collaborate with Kenny G.7) Those who supply Kenny G. with his mouthpieces and reeds8) Kenny G.9) Kenny G.10) Kenny G.Hey, trendies! Just because others like something doesn't mean it's good! Come on, you insipid sheep! Get minds of your own!"
1,I made a poop from which this album emerged,why would anyone want to buy this??this is not jazz or smooth jazz or even easy listning !!! kenny g is a horrible saxophonist every song on this album and (every other of his albums) sound the same and have no musical form or structure -- his tone is horrible !!! --- do not waste your time !!!!
1,Kenny G What Were You Thinking,"First of all this music didn't have any saxoflute. For all of you who don't know what a saxoflute is, I heard it was this new thing that is 10 times smoother than a regular low-tech saxophone. If you are reading this Big Bertha you might be kicking yourself that you didn't take that 10% profit for the saxoflute but its not too late when the teacher checks your homework and you give him the stare, the 10% is yours."
2,More widow than widower,"This one off tale from nineteen ninety two about the the black widow (sexy female, ex russian spy.) ( B W ) taking on a rouge miltary out fit , with the, vigilante punisher throwen in for good measure, is not such a bad one its just if your a punisher fan there is not much of the pun man in it ! yes its mostly about B W, the punisher put in too boost sales prehaps, cause just about any one could have filled his part in it!!! But with saying that B W is still a great character and its great to see her get her own story,and the art work is good and her and the punisher do make a suitably cool pair,just a bit more inter action with the two and this could have been a classic!!!! Anyway one just for the collection !"
5,A Unique Masterpiece!,"""Author Glenn Haertlein wrote Secret of the Circle as if he had delicately painted the pages. The intriguing plot and detailed scenery are so vivid that they project themselves into the mind of the reader without much imagination being necessary. I especially like how author Haertlein opens the chapter with memories of the main character, Jim Schortz's, grandfather during the Nazi's reign; and his parents, who stepped foot on American soil. I fell in love with the Schortz family. They filled me with sadness, joy and laughter...I felt Jim's stirring emotions as he sought for answers in his life and faith, and of course, the 'Circle'. Secret of the Circle is a unique masterpiece intricately woven with drama, adventure, mystery and page-turning suspense."""
1,Piece of Garbage,"This thing is a piece of trash. I bought one -- for $200 through the manufacturer's web site. I also wasted $75 on the Imperia motor. The result?It broke on the second use. The piece of the machine that feeds pasta out of the back fell off -- now the pasta spins around the interior endlessly. I have contacted the company about 10 times attempting to get it fixed, or attempting to get a refund. They have the WORST customer service known to mankind. They essentially just don't respond. Moreover, there are *zero-point-zero* instructions on connecting the motor to the machine at the Belpasta web site. (They claim it can be hooked up, but the motor is not designed for the machine, so it would somehow have to be jerry-rigged).This thing is junk. Save your money. Maybe just by an Imperia or an Atlas machine and a motor instead. A huge disappointment...."
4,"Simple to use, even for one!","After doing allot of research on pasta makers I settled on this one for it's ease of use, wider profile, ease of cleaning, and looks. With this pasta maker one person is able to turn out perfect pasta without feeling like a pretzel afterwords. I gave it less then four stars do there being no motor specifically made of it. With that said you really do not need one, it's that simple to use"
2,Overnight Moisturizing Socks,These socks werent much different then regular socks and when I put lotion on my feet it soaked through the thin sock and I used them for a week every night and they did nat make a difference with my feet. So I wont be buying any more pairs.
4,sit back and relax,"I liked the book, thought it was very good. I paid a sizable amount of money to trained with a large training company. This book took me further but I still want to go futher yet.I also learned a few more concepts than I did when I trained live. Overall I'm glad I got it and I recommend it."
1,An ad for the authors other products,This book is really just an advertisement for the author's live seminars and other products.A bit of a waste of time and money.
2,Interesting But Disappointing,"This could have been an interesting read, unfortunately the author has decided to use this book as an advertisement for his training seminars. On numerous occasions a concept was introduced and the reader was directed to visit a weekend training seminar for more information. I am sorry that I paid for an advertisement for the author's seminar."
5,To the point and simple to understand.,"To the point and simple to understand. That's what this book is all about. For those who are getting their feet wet into this magnificent profession and are not quite versed on terms and lost in the myths about hypnosis, you got a wonderful resource here, and because you are interested in reading this means you would want more, this book is also a resource for you to find the perfect trainings and further reading materials to enhance your learning and support you on your new path."
3,Not so good after the first 30 minutes,"I got this movie because I love Disco Dancer and it's by the same director. The first 30 minutes are hilarious but the rest doesn't keep up. The songs are kind of boring, aside from the title song which is ""Love, Love, Love"" to the tune of Pet Shop Boys ""It's a Sin"", and a couple are basically the same as two in Disco Dancer with different words."
2,Very small,"My head is not that big, and this hat was still a bit too small for me. It was very tight and I just did not care for it."
2,way too small,"This item while it looks nice, is not large enough for a man's head. It would be appropriate for a child or if you wanted it to be really snug to wear UNDER another hat it would work. Since it was so inexpensive and the shipping was more than the product I will not return it but I would otherwise."
1,Not what i wanted,Yes I had ordered 1 of these 2x about a mouth apart and they were different. I clicked on same like but what I was shipped was not the same and to be honest crappy. It was to stretchy and loose and looked like a balloon on my head.But the 1st one I ordered I loved it. It was perfect.
4,Cool cap,This is a good product and was delivered on time the price was right and looks great. Made a good gift and he said it was very warm.
4,Nice,Keeps your head worm and fits great. This is great for the winter in area's like Michigan where the winter get's pretty cold.ThanksGreg
3,hat,good hat. totally worth 2$ that I paid. could have been a little bit softer but u get what u pay for. I totally recommend it. BUY THIS! NOW!!!!!!!
5,nice hat,I got this hat for my hubby thinking he would like the visor part because he wares glasses. . . well he did like it and was waring it until my stepson found it and fell in love with it! Maybe I should have ordered 2?
2,Square hat on a round head?,"This hat is square. The stitching on the sides come up to points, which make it look square on my head. Maybe a better fit on someone with a really large scull?!"
5,Great cap for winter weather,"I use this in winter weather for outdoor work and golf. It fits my large head well, keeps me warm, the mini visor helps to block out the low sun, and the ear coverings stay in place. Wonderful.One negative - it looks pretty ugly when on, not shaped well like the product photo. This is of no importance to me, but it may to you if you value form over function."
3,Okay in a pinch,"It's a winter hat. It covers your head when it's cold out. The brim is very small, giving it an unbalanced look if you're a grown man, but it does cover your ears well. I'll wear it for snow shoveling and other outdoor tasks around the house, but probably wouldn't wear it around town. It does not look quite as good in person as it does in the pictures on Amazon."
5,Great products,Great product but much prefer the Zaini hats at [...] - they are much more baggy and original. But if this floats your boat them buy it. Very comfy and reasonable.
2,Cheap but Suitable,"Very cheaply made. However, it served its purpose in keeping my head warm at the slopes this year. The bill is super short... almost defeats the purpose. But that's ""fashion"" for ya. Haha!"
3,"Ok,","Hat is ok, good price. The only problem i have with it is that on top where the seems come together. When I put it on it isn't completely round on top. There are two ""bumps"" that make it almost look like I have Mickey Mouse ears on my head. Even if I pull it tight down on my head as far as possible the ""bumps"" still show up. I'm not going to wear it because of how it looks."
2,Don't like the visor,"I bought this hat because I thought it would look cool. Maybe it's just not for me, but I wear baseball hats all the time, but this just didn't look right. The hat is a typical winter hat, and works just fine...just style-wise, not awesome."
4,Nice and simple,"Very cheap and gets the job done. I didn't really know what the size of this was but, if I were to give it one, I'd say it's a medium. It's snug. I used it when I went snowboarding and it kept me warm and dry at windy and snowy conditions."
2,Knit Beanie visor hat,"Totally not for an adult, fits more like a 6-7 year old. Wouldn't recommend purchasing this hat unless it's for a child."
1,Save your money.,"I decided on taking s chance with this items and I was thoroughly disappointed. The material is thin and uncomfortable with no insulation properties, as the wind and cold just pierce through to leave you with a brain freeze. Pay 5 bucks more and buy the Carhartt brand, you won't be sorry."
2,"looks good, feels good but kinda small, and i think it's used.","like i said looks good , feels good but it might be used not new. It didn't even have a tag on it, it was not package in a plastic cover, plus it looked dirty i found a piece of hair inside the beanie."
1,paper thin,there is a reason this hat is cheap. it is paper thin and one size fits SMALL. and i am pretty sure the brim is made of cardboard.
1,thin small hat,"this hat is very small, would only fit a small child. and it is also very thin, doesnt do much to keep the cold out. the only good thing was the price. i would return it if it was worth it"
1,Too small even for regular size adult heads...,"I ordered 2 of this thinking it's a good hat for adults. It turned out these are meant for small children, not adults.Do not buy if you're an adult and plan to use these yourself. Good if you are buying these for your little ones ages 10 and younger."
2,Not as pictured / VERY small / Refunded,"Beanie was not as pictured. I wish it was cuz it looks nice, but the fold of material over the visor appears in photo to be about 2"" wide. In reality it was maybe 1/2"". One size fits all? Maybe if you have a child sized head. Requested refund. Refund received."
1,Smells like creosote!,"Tried this on my son for about 2 minutes. Hours later at bedtime I can't understand why his hair smells like tar. Then I smell the hat and realize it smells like creosote! I ordered two and they are both disgustlingly stinky. I washed them today and they still stink. My husband came in from outside while the hats were in the dryer and asked, ""what is that chemical smell?"" Unless you like chemicals on your head, I would suggest you not purchase this hat. Cheap."
1,Garbage,"This product is garbage.As one other reviewer noted, the cuff is only about 1/4"" high above the visor, and looks ridiculous. Not at all as pictured. Further, the hat is EXTREMELY tight (and I have a small head) from the forehead around back. This puts a lot of pressure on your head and mats your hair down unlike any other hat I've ever worn. Beyond that, ironically, it's loose and baggy on the top near the crown of the head, and looks like a sock (all folded over and saggy).I understand it only costs a few bucks delivered, but is absolutely worthless. I simply cannot fathom the other reviews which say this is a good product. Mine went straight in the garbage."
1,was not what i expected...,was waaaaay too small. ended up giving it away to my younger brother. Its not a bad hat if you have a small head I guess
1,just not the hat in the pic,"It came nicely packaged. It was just not the hat in the picture.It looks old and dirty. And it is too small for an average adult's head.They should offer this product as ""used"" and ""for kids"""
3,Well Made Except For...,"What can you say? It's a Beanie!! Not much to reviewing it but I will say what I can.I had the same experience as the previous reviews related to the head band/folded part that runs around the head. Apparently this is an irregular since it gets real small above the brim and does not match the picture. I don't think anyone would ever notice unless you point it out.It does run small and is not wool. Other than that, it seems to be really well-made and it was very inexpensive. It has reasonably thick material for cool, not arctic, weather. There are no snags or fray's and the shipping was fast. I purchased this for golf and fishing, hence the visor. I don't care about the design since I bought it for function over style and it only cost a couple of dollars.If you want to save money and keep your head warm, go for it. If you are wearing to school/work and style is important, you should get a different one from somewhere else."
3,i got what i paid,"i think the price its right, its a cheap hat, so i got cheap quality, i can't blame the seller, its a good price for that materials, could be a lot better"
1,Corner cutting.,"Item has significant 'corner cutting'.Item listed here: [...] was NOT what was received. Item received here:1: [..]2: [..]The item received is significantly smaller than the one pictures. The one pictured comes far over the ears and down to the neck. The item received goes halfway down the ears and not even to the bottom of the neck hairline.The item received has a large section of fabric cut out from the front, just above the bill.The item received has significantly less fabric than the item pictured. You can stretch this and see through it."
2,I purchased two of these,because I figured I could wear one while the other one is being cleaned. Now that I have them I have worn them a few times but am afraid to wash them because I believe the bill is cardboard so not a very good rating.
1,You get what you pay for...,"The hat was $1.82. Was way too small for my big dome, but even too small for my girlfriend's tiny head. Not sure what I was expecting, but you get what you pay for..."
3,Product is nice but......,"It is smaller than the picture, sure you can stretch it on your head, but if you do that, it will lose its stretch."
5,I was looking for a winter hat that would keep snow/rain off of my face.,This hat is exactly what I needed. I don't like to carry umbrellas at work because I carry a tote and a purse. This is a great hands free way of keeping my face dry and the hat is nice and warm.This is a very well made hat.
2,"Seller good, product lame","The seller is great, but this product is small, itchy, not warm. Totally synthetic - wool is so much better than this."
3,Beanie,"Knit Beanie Visor Hat is OK, but it also shrinks alot when wash. It's a one size fits all which is large and once I wash it, totally different story."
1,"Irregular Hat, JUNK!!! Good luck if you want to buy it.","WARNING: This seller selling ""Irregular Hat"". As the other 1 star reviewers noted, the cuff is only about 1/4"" high above the visor, and looks ridiculous!!! Not as photo. This seller purchased cheap IRREGULAR merchandise and sell them. It should belong at dollar store sell at 2 for $1."
2,Decent but doesn't last,I got the hat for my boyfriend for Xmas and he has warn it to and from work plus a few days during our snow storms. The visor is falling out due to poor stitching but other than that there were no complaints
3,Cheap hat,"This hat is fine, but at the end of the day it is just a regular beanie with a piece of cardboard sewn into it."
5,Great deal for kids who lose hats easy,This is the second time I have purchased this hat. I love it because my son loses hats often. So I don't have a lot of out of pocket expense to keep his head warm. It is also stylish. I would buy again.
3,its ok,I wish it had more bill on it and I would prefer a little warmer matieral but on a day too cool to where a ball cap its good. Just not for very cold
2,"Good Hat, Too Small","This is a good hat for the money (one cent!), but is pretty small. It fits me okay, but I like my hats a little on the larger size. The insulation is decent but for the money it's great. It's good for windy weather but if you are out and about in the snow I would recommend shelling out a little bit more for a better hat (fleece, waterproof, etc). But for one penny, you can't beat this hat!"
5,Exactly what it looks like,This hat came exactly as I expected and has already been washed and kept its form perfectly. I also hear it is very warm!
2,Waaay too small and tight,"I don't recommend this product, unless you have a really small head. The hat is so small and tight, I don't knwo if anyone can wear it. 2 stars instead of 1 for the cheap price. It's poor quality with cheap material, definitely made in China."
4,great cap,I ordered this cap for my son for Christmas and I was a little worried about it not fiting but it worked out great.
1,Poor quality and production,"Received this as a gift... it doesn't look too much like the photo. The stitching for the brim came undone two days after receipt. Quality like that speaks for itself. The folded material (overlap) above the brim on my hat is only a 1/4 "" compared to the 2"" overlap they show in the photo. On the plus side, its still relatively warm.. but definitely some production issues. Guessing from reviews some people got a decent one and I just didn't. Buyer beware."
1,knit hat,I ordered this item on Dec. 8. I did not receive it until 01/09/12. The hat is fitted for a toddler. It fits my 4yr old perfectly. It is not thick or warm. Very disappointed with this buy.
5,Does what it's supposed to.,This hat does what I expected it to do. Keeps my head warm and looks fashionable at the same time.
1,decepcion numero 2,"robo decepcion ustedes no entregan tenprano y lo que llega es una basura quiero mi dinero de regreso,decepcion traten de verificar sus productos antes de enviarlos ,hay madre solo quieren el dinero ofrecen cosas barats que luego se convierten en fiasco,,,,,,,,,,amazon hagan algooooooooooooooooooooooooo"
3,Acecombat X,"I got this game for christmas. The graphics are good. but overall I think the game could use alot more work, in the simple areas. Graphics are fine, but that aside, the voices are terrible. I mean, they have you taking orders from this dude with a really soft spoken voice. he isn't firm and commanding, and he's shy. What kind of commander is that.. The story line, as far as I have gotten, which isn't all that far yet, is not anywhere near as good as ace combat 5, which in my opinion, was the best videogame storyline ever, it literally gave me chills when I reached the end. It was amazing, I had expected more from ace combat x, however, it still is a good game, which Is why I give this a 3.As far as terms of fun go, daxter set the tone for fun, so it comes up to about a 3 as well. Worth the purchase, I haven't seen many other good games out there. Psp has such potential, but nobody really takes the time to use it to the max."
2,Garbage!!!1,"For the year it was made, it has cheap graphics!!!! and the story is super stupid, DON'T BUY IT. The developers didn't put much effort to make it.The shipping was very fast"
1,"Skies of deception, game of deception","This game is the remake of Ace Combat IV for the PS2; however, game play on the PSP is far worse from game play on the PS2.Controls don't feel the same, camera cumbersome to switch, and just don't get it."
4,Great game!,"Whether you're an Ace Combat fan or not, this game is really fun. There are alot of jet fighters you get to choose from. Like the F-22 Raptor, F- 16 Falcon, F-15 Strike Eagle, F-117 Nighthawk, F-18 Hornet, F-35 Lightning II, and many more. There's even a few planes you can ""customize"", which means buying upgrades for it like an engine, armor, etc.A cool feature to this game is that you get to choose most of the missions in the order you want to, but it will affect the status of some of your other missions, so choose wisely. =)There are a couple of things I don't like about this game though. It has some profanity in it, not terrible words, but they use the H-word, the D-word, etc. And they have a movie\picture scene where it shows a guy who is also the narrator holding a glass of wine and making a comment about it.Overall, I'd recommend buying this game."
4,A Well Deserved Tribute,"Way before Kirk Franklin, Andrae Crouch brought a new wave to contemporary gospel. One of the great songwriters of the 20th Century, it's only fitting he be honored for his astounding work. Though everyone involved are to be commended, the standouts for me were Take 6, The Winans, First Call and The Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir. The Take 6 arrangement of 'This Is Another Day' is powerful! Some of their best work anywhere. Cece Winans rendition of 'Take Me Back' was very appropriate for the opening track. The final track finds Andrae himself, joined by an all-star cast on the reverent 'My Tribute.' This album is filled with some of the best inspirational music ever written."
5,Tribute: Songs of ANdrae Crouch,This is a wonderful album. Every song is uplifting. I have owned it since it came out years ago. I had to buy it twice due not taking care of it.I can say its one of my favorite albums.
5,BEAUTIFUL SONGS,"I'm a fan of Andrae Crouch, so any songs that he does, is always a hit for me! He can do no wrong when it comes to his songs."
5,Surprise,"I always thought alot of salt was tasty and good for you. Maybe that's why I need to take pills for high blood pressure. Bout time someone steps up to the plate to help provide products that improve your health if you choose.The strangest thing that happened is that I have tried a number of no salt items, and I thought that I would hate them. Guess what, a number of items are much better tasting than the same items with salt. I am stunned and healthier."
4,Recordings made in England 1979-82,"Recordings made in England 1979-82 including Kokomo Island, Ooby Dooby, Nebraska Sunrise, Long Lonely Nights, Devil Woman, Rock Your Little Baby to Sleep."
5,Product: perfect; Cust. Service: excellent,"I accidentally ordered the wrong liner. One for an extended cab instead of a crew cab. As Husky liners practically always fit perfectly my error was quite obvious when I tried to install it. Used the amazon return option, put the wrong one back in the box it came in and ordered the correct one. UPS picked up the wrong one the next day and two days later I had the right one. Outstanding customer service. And as I've come to expect from Husky, once I ordered the right one it fit perfectly. Best feature is a ridge that keeps items tucked under the back seat in place, even in South Florida stop and go traffic!"
4,Return of Chen Zhen,I really enjoyed this movie. I rented the movie more than once and I keep coming back to it. Thanks
4,Great Movie,This movie is part of a series of movies released in recent years to tell stories of how China once were not too long ago.
2,dud....,The movie was disappointing and I am an avid fan of Donnie Yen Martial art movies! Plot and action so typical but the choreography is what made me finish the movie....
1,copy cat,"Saw it once, saw it twice. Three times it lost the charm. I'm Sick of over and over. Legend Of the Fist The Return of Chen Zhen."
3,Would be great IF,the vendor hadn't sent me yet another defective DVDvery frustrating to get through most of the movieonly to not be able to watch last 30 minutes or soas the DVD was defective
3,english,this movie need to be in english ip man was and ip man2 was not i think the movies should be.
1,broken,"I received the item arrived broken and brought forth in me a feeling of anger, for the moment I do not care of ordering anything on amazon"
2,movie is very contriversal,"It starts off good, then here comes the nunchuks, then the ""Green Hornet, Kato"" (seen on the cover), then ""Enter The Dragon"" (Bruce Lee). This movie is mixed up. I believe the director was trying to combine a few different Bruce Lee movies in one. It did not do it for me and my friends. I'm glad I only spent $10.00 for the DVD."
5,Fist of Fury Series,This movie is a good adaption of the Fist of Fury (Bruce Lee) movie. Its a more modern style film but follows the same story mostly like all of the other Fist Movies. Donnie Yen as always delivers a great performance and Fluid Actions scenes. This may be tied with my favorite Fist of Fury remake along with Legend of Fist starring Jet Li. I would highly recommend adding this to your collection if you don't already own it.The blu-ray offers better picture quality over the standard DVD edition. I'd give the pic quality a 4 out of 5. With few slight flaws here and there but nothing major to ruin the film or many people to notice. Overall great package and the DVD is a bonus.
3,Great,This is a great movie. We got it for our son and he has really enjoyed it. We had just gotten it in time for Christmas
5,Awesome movie! Quality DVD,"Donnie Yen must be having the best year of his life. First the IP MAN series, then this gem of a martial arts flick. Thoroughly enjoyable for any fan of martial arts. This DVD is great. I am referring to this exact one on Amazon, exactly as it is pictured. There are a bunch of poor quality bootlegs floating around and I was victim to two of them before buying this DVD. This one is top notch with a super sharp anamorphic picture and even had english subtitled special features including a documentary on the making of the film."
2,Didn't do much for me,"Have really been enjoying watching Donnie Yen act and perform, but this drama, just had to much setting up of characters. Bruce Lee and Jet Li have played the popular character, but did not really see a need for another version. The early war, combat scene is amazing. But suddenly it gets into drama and very little else. There are fights and conflict, but not really caring about any of the characters. Also all the different bad guys were a little difficult to follow. I'm on the fence recommending this."
1,"Review of ""Legend of the Fist"" 2010","I am a big martial arts films fan.I'm sorry but Legend of the Fist was weak. Definitely not worth all the hype. Had promise but then the ending really ruined it.Worthy of watching once, not necessary to own."
1,Utter disaster,"This has to be the worst movie I have watched in years, and I made it all the way through Sucker Punch. Donnie Yen's makeup has him looking like a walking pumpkin through most of the movie, and his acting has about as much spirit as the aforementioned squash. What plot there is flogs Chinese nationalism from start to finish, which would be fine if they had bothered to find writers that could build a coherent flow and stick with it, as it is the movie whipsaws from one unconnected scene to the next without a shred of continuity. I'd love my money back please, even if I can't get back the time I wasted watching this disaster."
4,Good historical Hong Kong action film,"Very good Hong Kong action film with some brutal fight action, sufficient character development, and a well developed historical background. Fun."
1,DONT BUY IT,NOT A GOOD STROLLER. NICE LOOKING BUT THE SAFETY LOCKS ON THE HANDLES BROKE WITHIN ONE WEEK. STILL TRYING TO CONTACT THEM FOR MY WARRANTEE. BUYERS BEWARE...
3,Fossil watch,"The product is awesome if we can get it to work. However, there is no operation manual with the watch and upon contacting the seller, I was told there wasn't one available, only the warranty! The watch will not ""blink"" like it is supposed to and my only option is to either take it to a jeweler or return it. I haven't done either yet, am still trying to decide. This is an inconvenience, therefore, only 3 stars are awarded!"
3,Cover Album,"Just wanted to let anyone interested in buying this cd over the internet know that this is a cover album. They don't have any track listings or reviews up yet. There are two original tunes, ""Nazis on my Radio"" & ""Rotten"". Both are catchy pop much like the best tracks on his previous album. The rest are covers that range from very good to very curious. Most of which being a Beastie Boys cover and a strange yet good Alice in Chains tune. The rest are more down his alley, from Neil Young, Elton John, and Oasis. Buy it if you like his cover versions that he plays live, but avoid it if you're looking to spend [MONEY]on new material."
5,Great!,"Found out some new things about Wyatt Earp. Great story, historical photos, and what really happened at the OK Corral. The aftermath and how it affected everyone involved. Great!"
4,"Where's ""FLY AWAY PRETTY BABY""?","These songs sound great and superb in a multi-disc Cd Player along with Greatest Hits cds by Andy Kim, Partridge Family, Lobo, The Archies, Tommy Roe, Jackson 5(from that era) at ""Random Play""...but, where is ANDY & DAVID's Hot 100 Chart hit, ""FLY AWAY PRETTY BABY""? It should have been included here! PLEASE don't miss out on their 1990's cds! B/T/W...those other artists mentioned are great too! There is room and affection for all types of music!"
5,"""An Absolutely Outstanding Book with a misleading title...""","The True Value 'Hidden' inside this book - is something of such an Enormous Magnitude that the title should be revised!!!Yes, this book will for sure guide you in ""How to get Money Fast""...However, an accurate title of describing the Treasures Within this book would be ""The Ultimate Book about LOVE!""Never in my life have I directly experienced such an overwhelming Feeling of pure Love ""radiating"" from a book...Just open the front cover and this book will 'reveal' itself to You...It is beyond any doubt THE Ultimate guide on how to Give and Receive LOVE...Mats Fondelius - CEO"
3,"Good enough, but why?","First, this recording is problematic: Garrett's style is so close to Coltrane's that the pieces come off as tributes rather than interpretations. He is an amazing player, but there is nothing here to offer us a reason to listen to this rather than the originals. Second, there is Pat Metheny. The main difference between this recording and Coltrane's is the replacing of McCoy Tyner with Metheny. Metheny is more of a soloist than an accompanist, and these pieces lack the solid foundation that Tyner provided for Coltrane's soaring soloes. As for what Metheny does provide, the results are mixed. When he and Garrett join together, the results are stunning. Left to his own devices, however, he tends to noodle around without much apparent direction."
3,Metheny must go,"What was Kenny Garrett thinking when he let Pat Metheny vomit all over this record? The rhythm section is super tight, and Garrett is excellent as always. But why, oh why, must Metheny pull out his dreaded cheeze whiz guitar synth on a beautiful tune like Lonnie's Lament? I mean you can have all the chops in the world, but it don't mean a thing if you haven't got any taste. If he must use that thing, he can do it on his own cornbread recordings. But on a Coltrane tune? It's almost sacrilege."
3,For PKD Fans in Search of Closure,"First, a confession: I became a ""Dickhead"" last year, and ended up reading every single title ever published by Philip K. Dick. Once I finished the last book (including the Selected Letters), I was looking for some form of closure so I could get on with my life and read other authors. I found that closure in ""The Secret Ascension.""Obviously written by a fan of PKD's work and personality, Bishop writes a book that is funny and imaginative, while mimicking, in a form of tribute, the style of PKD.While the actual delivery of the story lacks the power of PKD's writing, there are many funny moments and tidbits of PKD for fans to enjoy. Bishop employs the multiple narrative technique and the breakdown of commonplace reality that fans of PKD expected with each novel.The ending is quite satisfying, with a respectful nod to PKD's contribution to our ""koinos cosmos."" A must-read for any true PKD fan."
5,Quilt Finishing!,The tips and techniques presented in this easy-to-use book puts the finishing touches to the hours one spends on your quilt.
1,Nice wood--poor game,I bought this for a learning center in classrooms--thought the kids could add or multiply the numbers and have fun learning. Does not work very well at all--very frustrating. I made about 1 out of 5 shots and always got the ball through the same number. Definitely not worth even $4.50--I'm definitely returning this to Amazon.
2,Not fun,"This game is small in stature, much like the other ""House of Marbles"" games we have owned. I bought this game, along with ""Hoopla"" because they were both on clearance. I don't feel as if I got my money's worth, even for the price I paid. This game is extremely hard to master, especially if you're 6-years-old or younger. My kids grew frustrated with this game rather quickly, and it hasn't been out of the closet since."
4,Excellent LCD,"This is an excellent TV with great picture quality. The only issue is its warmth. Since I have this set placed in bedroom, the heat is unbearable especially in the summer. Anyone experience the same problem?"
2,It is in the shop,Every thing works well enough with the exception of the HDMI terminals that were not functional correctely as I recieved the Sharp Aquos LC32D42U LCD HDTV. The picture blinks on and off when I used either of the two HDMI terminals for input from my Direct TV HD receiver. Toke some effort to get Sharp arrange warrenty repair. It is still in the shorp. Hopefully it will get fixed soon. Aother feature that is missing from this TV is the option of elimating weak stations ater auto tune.
5,"great hdtv, especially for gaming","I was looking for a good hdtv for my apartment bedroom, specifically to be used with my PS3. I looked at a few samsungs, but eventually went with this tv for a few reasons. It seemed like a lot of people had problems using xbox 360 and ps3 with tvs that only had an 8 m/s response time, but the 6 m/s time of the sharp works very well. I also thought that for a 32"" hdtv, this price was very reasonable.sound: I'm sure most people would buy a sound system for this tv, but I don't really see it as being necessary, especially if it's just for a bedroom, as it is in my case.Overall, excellent hdtv with a fantastic picture, good sound, and very good for use in gaming"
4,Not Bad!!!,"At first we were bummed that when the red button was pushed, nothing would happen!!! Then after messing around with it for a while we noticed the button on the bottom had to be on a hard service to activate launch (we also used cardboard while playing on the carpet) Once that was figured out my boys ages 7 & 2 had a blast!!!! Be advised while allowing younger children to join in the fun, there are small pieces (rubberband)"
1,Good advice for new teachers but not good for PLT review,"I bought the first edition and flipped through this one at the store, but I did not see any changes. I thought that it had some good advice for new teachers, but the practice tests are nothing like what you will see on the PLT test. Some of the case studies in this book are just feel good stories that have a happy ending. Also, you don't have to read the case studies to answer the questions to the case studies, which is the complete opposite of the PLT.Did the writers of this book ever consult someone concerning the PLT? The questions for the case studies are nothing like the real PLT/ I thought that this new edition would have corrected that problem, but they are the same case studies and questions as the first edition.Again, it has some good advice for new teachers, but does a bad job of preparing someone for the PLT case studies."
2,"It is okay, but surely there are better options","I bought this book as a summary to prepare and found it lacking. The subject matter part was okay, but I found my textbooks much better at summarizing the info. I was especially disappointed with this review's emphasis on writing well organized essays. There just is not enough time or space to do this (1 page is allowed for each response, no more) and the Praxis exam itself states that a bulleted paragraph would work just fine. Other students just did bullets and managed to pass the exam offered in April. Anyway, if/when I retake this exam (I'm pretty sure I'll have to retake it), I'll just get the guide from ETS and do bullets."
3,Gets the job done.,"There are probably better books out there, but this gets the job done. I feel like many of the points that they make are pretty elementary, but I guess it serves for a decent review. Did well on the PLT, so I guess this book did what it needed to."
5,Great Value for the money,The set is well worth the money. Coating does not flake off. The assortment of sizes is excellent.
5,Good Set,"This is a great set and I am very happy with the quality of these. They feel very heavy duty and the non-stick doesn't flake off, which i find very important. The grips are comfortable and don't get hot and the lids fit correctly. Though for some reason one of the pot lids doesn't fit on the smaller pan. But overall this is one good looking set of pots and pans."
1,Poor nonstick that appears to be defective,Defective nonstick material! I own the 3-quart pan. I just bought it and the nonstick began coming off (around the water rim) the second time I used it. I was just boiling water/cooking pasta using medium heat. Ridiculous.
3,T-Fal Professional Nonstick cookware from Amazon,"I like the cookware, but I wish you could close up the vent sometimes. My one quart pot fell from the height of the stove unto a rug. The side got dented in and now the cover doesn't fit. I tried to buy another pot from T-Fal, but they said they don't sell them individually. I had my set less then two weeks when this happened."
4,Soft Cookware,"I've used these pots and pans for about a year now and they are non-stick, but probably not the best. I don't have anything to base this premise on except the fact that I believe it to be so. The pots and pan do, however, bend very easily and on the same token can be bent back very easily, but you never seem to bend them quite back to where they first were. Also the rivets are not non-stick and have a tendency to get food stuck to them. Overall, I'd have to say that this is a very inexpensive, yet good quality set. Probably better bang for your buck than the more expensive brands."
3,Question,"I have a really dumb question......I received my T Fal on Friday. I tried to boil water for pasta last night and it would not boil. I then remembered the directions said not to use the high heat on the stove, so I turned it down but still did not boil. What did I do wrong????? Is the bubbling on the bottom considered boiling in these pans?"
3,Pans,This is a gift 4 my son & daughter-in-law 4 Christmas so I don't know how they will rate it. My son usually does his research so I'm sure it is a good buy.
3,Cruising the Southern and Western Caribbean,I am returning this item.Book is ok but didn't cover the areas I was interested in.Lay out and table of contents not easy to use to find the islands your interested in.
1,Offended!,"I read this book and found it to be extremely offensive. Having been a resident of Greene County, I found the use of actual names of people I knew to be insulting and degrading. This book reads like the ramblings of a twelve year old boy."
1,notinmycollectionanymore,"I sent this book to a family friend that wanted to read it as soon as I was finished. Being born and raised in the area ""depicted"" in the book, as well as most of our family's friends both young and old, most of us found the novel very disappointing and offensive. You would think the author would at least have a developed background to set the story up with. Ms. Rolens needs to do a lot more short story writing before any of her future novels (hopefully none) hit the press. Being an avid reader, I got rid of the book before anyone I knew found it lying around my house."
4,"""Worthy's Town""","This is an interesting book about small town life starting in the early 1900's and ending after the second World War. The hero of the book is not so much Worthy as it is his grandson (who think he is his ""pa"")Cappy. Cappy grows up to use his god given talents and also to avenge the murder of his best friend...even though the murder is brought to justice in a very unconventional way. Good reading."
5,Great,"This book is great. I had some basic knowledge in Spanish, but forget it since high school. This book made it easy to catch back on, and explains Spanish for a new learner. Not only does it go into common medical dialogues, with descriptive, or yes/no answers, but also teaches basic verbs, nouns, and conjugations of the verbs. The pictures dont have Spanish/English captions, only Spanish, but there is a guide in the back. This book will teach you everything you need, and then some. If you are looking for a book, this is the one."
3,Practical but Disjointed,"It's pretty good for starting up. I had no background in spanish beyond the average american who learned a few words in grades 2-4, although I do have an extensive background in french. The grammar's similar enough to cue me in on the fact that they don't explain things you're using or could be using to thoroughly and comfortably use the language or even understand much of it. Sombrero is a pertinent medical term as well, apparently. Large chunks of it are very useful, others not so much. Use it for a course, but beyond that it doesn't teach the language in a logical progression of grammar functionality."
3,ehh...,"The simplest and most elementary language book. I'm intermediate level in Spanish and wanted something to give me more conversational skills strictly Medical office related. I'm sorry I wasted $12 on this. Useful to the totally ignorant beginner I'm sure ...but for me, it was so not worth the money."
3,McGraw-Hill's Complete Medical Spanish,"Although this book is not bad, it only gives you the basic information needed to get through a physical exam of a patient, and does not come with pronunciation of the words. I would recommend buying the 'Spanish for Family Practitioners' set that includes this book and a set of 3 CD's. The CD's provide dialogs and pronunciation."
3,Disappointing,"Thought this book included the CDs. . .it appears you can't get the complete set anywhere, even from the publisher. Sorry, but reading pronunciations in a book just doesn't cut it."
1,not recieved,"I have not recieved this product, charged to my credit card about 6 weeks ago, estimated by shipper to arrive Sept 4, it's now Oct 3 and no book. E-mailed Amazon but no answer to the e-mail, just this undoubtedly machine generated message inviting comments. OK there it is. Are we going to deep-six our society in automation?"
5,A must see,"This DVD is mesmerizing, beautiful, and astounding. The postcard (motion) pictures from USA (New England, California, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Hawaii, and Washington), Africa (Morocco, Tanzania) and Asia (Tibet, Bhutan) are breathtaking. - Louis Schwartzberg created a wonderful work of art. - I love it and encourage everybody to watch it. - If you don't know where to spend your next vacation, here you'll find some extraordinary suggestions."
3,"More Detail Please, or use HD Camera!","Warning: If you want to see any kind of detail, watch using a Darbee Darblet!Pros: Good subject material and energenic background musicCons: Serious lack of detail due to ?#1 - Intentionally wanted a Soft look and Feel - wasn't a Good Idea!#2 - From watching Louie squinting, he needs prescription glasses in order to Focus his Camera correctly.#3 - Was Originally filmed in Low Res, then bumped up to Blu-ray Output - didn't work!Wanted to turn off half way through due to lack of detail. Being out of Focus like this, any kind of camerapanning created a dizzy blur. Any kind of motion of the subject being filmed, same blur.Best part, the faces, in focus, of Morocco Men!Was a HD Camera even used?Watched the whole thing due to it only being 57 minutes long.You might as well buy the DVD, instead of Blu-ray, because of this detailing fault."
2,Older but has it's Uses,Somewhat disappointed in this book. I was hoping for some good pictures of ringworm as it looks under a microscope. Unfortunately not the case. Also the book is way old. My fault for not double checking the publishing date. On the plus side it has some great pictures of large animals with fungus. The book is in good shape and all in all not a bad value for the price.
5,The best on 1 Corinthians in English,"I'm writing a commentary on 1 Corinthians and have regularly used a few dozen commentaries. This is without doubt the best in English, and in world-wide competition comes in second only to Wolfgang Schrage's An die Korinther (EKKNT, 1991-2001) in four volumes. Thiselton easily beats out the solid volumes by Fee (NICNT, 1987), Garland (BECNT, 2003) and Fitzmyer (Anchor Bible, 2008). It is also more technical than these three and requires a firm grasp on the Greek text.Additional note: By the way, since someone above wondered aloud whether people read the books they review, I have read all of these volumes from cover to cover. Thiselton is not for those who want rapid answers, so he's not an easy read. Still, he wins the blue ribbon in English commentaries."
3,Thiselton's - First Corinthians,"A slight correction to the first review on this listing. The volume has 1446 pages plus xxxiii introductory pages (not the above xxxii number).The volume claims to be on ""alkaline paper"", yet it lacks the ANSI Z39.48-19xx symbol. Additionally, I might add that the main value of the work is that it is a collection of ancient and some current views concerning First Corinthians. As a collection, it is handy, as many of the views can now be seen in one place -- in THIS volume. Thiselton, himself, does not add much to our understanding of this epistle."
4,A superb work - but read the shorter one if you're not a PhD candidate!,"This is a superb commentary - as just about anything by Thiselton is. However, when leading a Bible Study on Corinthians, I found Thiselton's 300 page (as opposed to 1500 page) commentary on 1 Corinthians, published by Eerdmans, a far more helpful and manageable affair. It's subtitle is, 'A Shorter Exegetical & Pastoral Commentary.' In this shorter work (written and condensed a few years after this one), Thiselton gives his opinion on things, makes numerous contemporary insights, and raises provocative questions that would be helpful for each pericope. These questions are invaluable, both for the individual reader - but also as 'reflection questions' for groups. So my answer? BUY THE OTHER COMMENTARY ... and get this one if you love the infinitesimal discussion!"
5,Quilting Made Easy,"Great book! Fun projects and easy to understand language, especially for the beginning quilter!"
4,Guitar Wolf - 'Wolf Rock!' (Less Than TV),"Guitar Wolf's debut CD - first hitting us where it hurts in 1993, as they do a pretty good job of covering Motorhead's ""Ace Of Spades"", ""Mars Twist"" is head-splitting as so is the unreal ""Machine Gun Guitar"" and ""Jack The Ripper"". Again, the production isn't the best - but in this case, I think that was the point + 'Wolf Rock' is said to have been recorded in in Seiji's basement (I believe it). Nice to be able to get on the Internet and check out an entire band's repertoire."
5,"In the Beginning, was the ""Word""","From the chaos of a small empty room full of strongly independant (and very amusing) Letters to the order of a single, initial ""Word"" at the command of ""Let there be Light"", ""Alphazeds"" is a brilliantly simple Creation Myth that is at once vaguely familiar, and marvelous in its simplistic, original details. Not just for ""Design"" fans of the Glasers, or ""Typography Nuts"", our Four Year old enjoys this book as much as the adults. Children can identify with many of the single characteristics that define each letter, such as ""Bashful B"" or ""Mighty M"". To give a letter a personality, while animating the alphabet makes for a useful cognitive tool for young, soon-to-be readers. And for the adults, we can enjoy the humorous take on typography, the fun dialogue that can come from Independant letters just meeting each other for the first time, and allusions to the story of the creation of the first ""word"". Savor and Enjoy."
3,Still working...,"I've had the 3800 printer since it was first released. It works well, making prints up to 17x25 inches quite nicely. These large cartridges are a better value than the tiny capacity cartridges on smaller printers. Not surprisingly, the cost per ml of these large cartridges is not nearly as low as it should be.If you don't use the printer frequently, then once or twice a week, it is a good idea to print a Nozzle Check page, to be sure that all the colors and print heads are working right. I find the yellow often has gaps and necessitates head cleaning--and there goes your ink supply and maintenance cartridge life. Oh well, it's still an excellent large printer."
3,WCW Starrcade 1997 Review,"This was a very good Starrcade with a very good card. The main event was over-rated, but was still very good. I don't remember a whole lot about the undercard, but I do remember being better than expected. One match I do remember was The Giant vs. Kevin Nash in a giant vs. giant match. Sting vs. Hollywood Hogan was pretty good, considering the amount of wrestling ability Hogan has. Sting really carried this match, but the one thing that stunk up this match was Bret Hart's silly interference in which he restarted the match and let Hogan's mostly clean ""win"" slip away from the Biggest Icon in Sports. All in all, this is a good event which could have standed a few changes. This video is recommended."
5,MISLABELED AS 1997 ACTUALLY 1996,"This title was labeled as Starrcade 1997 when in reality it contains Starrcade 1996. Misprints also occured with the covers and labels for Starrcade 1995, 1997, World War 3 1995, 1996, 1997. Alot of sellers are not aware of this as they just buy and sell titles for profit rather than actually being a die hard wrestling fan and or reviewing product before reselling it. The U.K. DVD cover posted here is not the same as the original U.S. video box cover. The back cover is totally different. Not having viewed the U.K. DVD rerelease I would hazard a guess that the content has also been altered and or edited. BEWARE OF WHAT THIS U.K. DVD VERSION ACTUALLY CONTAINS !"
3,Hogan vs. Sting is the main event,Don't listen to the people who said that this Starrcade was the one with Piper vs. Hogan as the main event. The people who said that are complete morons.
4,Pretty good lacks what should have been quality matches,A really great ppv. But it should have been Raven and Benoit and not Saturn and Benoit even though it was a good match. What the hell was Savage doing in the second match. Anyway Henning vs. DDP was the greatest match. The Sting and Hogan match could have been better.
5,Hollywood Hogan vs. Sting is the main event,"Not a bad ppv, but the Hogan/Sting match had to be the most disappointing match I've ever seen. This match alone marked the beginning of the end for WCW's dominance in the ratings war."
4,Lots of action and excitement.A great Starrcade.,"This Starrcade featured the long- awaited battle between Sting and ""Hollywood"" Hogan for the World Title. This match deserves to be seen: a classic and memorable match with a controversial ending (watch & find out for yourself). This event contains some great and exciting matches;including Eric Bischoff vs. Larry Zybysko with Nitro on the line,DDP vs. Curt Hennig for the U.S. Title,and the then-World-Champion-to-be Bill Goldberg against Steve ""Mongo"" McMichael. A great Starrcade all around."
3,Whoooooooooooooooo,"This Pay Per View is ok. But all the while throgh you are waiting for Sting vs Hollywood Hogan, that may be the reason it is boring. The Sting vs Hogan match is excellent, top notch, Both of them score the win! How you ask, watch and find out. END"
5,good starrcade,"I don't know who the idiets above are, this is starrcade 97 when sting battles hogan. December 25th is still in 97 smart people. Anyway it was a good show."
3,Starrcade 97 hogan vs piper,"the main event of this is piper vs hogan,not hogan vs sting which is on the 98 one,the card is dominated by the nwo but has some great lucha action on it and a great ultimo dragon vs dean malenko."
3,A quick course in Roman history,If you need an overview of the Roman Empire this is the video for you. I thought it gave me a cross section of the important events leading to the rise and fall of the fantastic Roman Empire.
4,Great bath toy,"My 3 1/2 year old loves taking baths and loves bath toys. She loves this toy. Although at first I didnt think she would be able to fill them with water herself, she picked up on it pretty quickly. Its a great part of the exposure process to music and musical notes. The only thing is if they are tipped the water comes out the mouth piece which caught her by surprise a few times but other than that, great toy and great value."
2,Skimpy,"A skimpy paperback. Spanning only 95 pages, it appears hastily put together. It does have merit in quickly summing up the Silicon-Germanium field and its possible industrial prospects, especially in optoelectronics.The best usage might simply be the names of the key researchers. Given these, you could search for their papers in the Citation Index, or on the web.Otherwise, you may want to pass on this book."
3,horale!,"que va! abi y pichi, ustedes rock! me encanta et canto ""es triste"" ya q' hable de lo q' yo siente. ud. tienen buen ritmo. pero creo q' tienen q' parar de usar tus nombres en los cantos. a Dios toda lo glori!"
3,good version of story book romance by rainy davis,"I like the version of this song --- however, it was not the one I was thnking of."
3,"A Wonderful Book, Printed by Ma Bell ?","I found this book to be quite enjoyable. A lot of work has gone into this. There are a few mistakes, but I'm sure these can and will be corrected, in a 2nd printing. If your a Stooge fan, this book is a must. The only real complaint I have, (reason why I didn't give five stars) is that the pages are SO paper thin, you have to be careful with the book, to prevent a page from tearing. I would rather have paid $60 for a hardback copy, with top quality paper. I hope this will be considered if another edition is printed. You will enjoy this book almost GUARANTEED, but I wanted to forewarn you about the paper being telephone book style."
2,"GUS VAN SANT, OPUS 16",Someone out there stoleLove Story's screenplay and was stupid enough to believe that no one would notice it. Already forgotten.
2,Most generic arthouse film ever,this movie is just like any other dramatic or comedic arthouse film ever its just like any other arthouse film
3,All About Aurio Corra,"He is the best brazilian New Age muscian, and one of the best of the world really. This album isn't the best, the only great music in the album is ""Campo De Estrellas"", really cool. If you like to make a great collection of Aurio Corra I recommned the followings best albums:""Soprus Universalis""""Imagens Vol. 1""""Imagens Vol. 2""""Quietude""""Reiki Vol. 1""""Reiki Vol. 2""I have all of them. There in USA, you can look for legal MP3's for download and music samples at: http://www.emusic.com/artist/10566/10566422.html , the titles available are:""Laize OM""""Reincarnation""""Reiki: The Ancient Art Of Healing""The only I liked is ""Reiki: The Ancient Art Of Healing"", here in Brazil the title is ""Reiki: The Healing Hands"". I love her music because I have used for sleep inducement and Bio-FeedBack in general (is perfect for this). He is formed as muscian is USA, a great sequencer and serious musician in my opinion. (...)"
4,Cheerleading & Dance,"I bought this for my cheer squad I was helping coach. At the time it was for 7/8th graders. This VHS tape wasn't what I had expected for that age group. If it had been an older squad, it would have been fine."
4,Love it!,"We went through two other ""boy, character"" alarm clocks before finding this one for our five year old son. He loves it and knows how to work the snooze button! It is definately practical and the light up display numbers are bright and clear to read. My only complaint is that I wish it came with an AM/FM radio too. This one is a keeper!"
4,I love it,"It was the right choice for me. It has good explanations how to do the excercises, even if it is your first time doing pilates, like me. It just takes you a few pages to get to the exercises. Sometimes it seams just a little bit too much, but in the end it is like a good friend is talking to you about your after-pregnancy-problems and is really understanding, whats going on in you. I did some excercises and than I read some from the pages before, that was a good mixture!"
4,An AMAZING book that I can't imagine every finding time to read,"I HOPE so much that these wonderful authors will make a dvd. The info and exercises in the book are wonderful. The authors also write about more than just exercise... about birth, afterbirth, how to keep your spirits up, etc.I had thought of photocopying the exercise pages and creating a sort of flip chart for myself, because it is impossible (with the difficult schedule of a new mom) to find time to sit down and do these exercises while reading the book on each thing...I would highly recommend reading the whole book, but once the book has been read, the mother needs a DVD to follow in order to really get any physical results out of this."
2,"Good idea, not a good e-book","I purchased this for the kindle app. The concept of the book is good, but it is not a good e-book. The page layout made it too hard to figure out which pictures went with which exercises, and the page breaks were poorly arranged. The book seemed to be well written, but there was too much explanation before they got to the actual exercises, and I lost steam. I only tried to do the exercises a few times, but got frustrated with the inability to easily flip between pages to understand the exercises I tried, which I am pretty sure I was not doing correctly. I think the $10 would have been better spent on an actual class or a video."
2,Stay Focused !!!,Well I am sorry to say that this failed in several ways.The foremost problem was the poor photography and many out of focus segments.They also tried to cover too much in only 26 minutes.This DVD was not very good.
5,"Heartwarming, Inspiring, Informative, Encompassing!","I didn't know a book on this subject could be as enlightening, inspiring, and informative all at the same time. Truly insightful in delivering and uncovering of the ""Homosexual"" dilemna of children who at some point in their lives have decided to face the consequences of telling their parents who they really are.This book focuses on uncovering the heartaches, fear, rejection, love of parents and at the same time confusion and self-doubt faced by most parents of homosexual children. This book provides personal glimpses and sheds some light on parent's fears that they are somehow responsible for who their children have become regarding their sexuality and focuses more on accepting and loving their child for the whole person that they have become instead of hating them or rejecting them for that one aspect of their life."
3,It's weird looking,The wig it has a weird looking. My Daughter loves it but I don't like the way she looks. Please note it's not the items fault.
1,"Barely fits 3 year old, Looks O K!","I suppose if you have the money lying around and it's gonna be a play wig . . .This is a NEON yellow wig, hair on top is loose curls like the bangs. Headband was smashed and crinkled as was the rest of the wig. Bought so Cinderella could visit our Birthday Party (9 year old girl dressed as Cinderella for my 3 year olds birthday) needless to say it didn't even come close to fitting her and doesn't really fit my 3 year old! I think I could have made it look decent pretty easily. Just tooo small!"
3,Baby Bottle Straw ... Slightly disappointing,"ordered the 4oz wide bottle size...received the 8oz wide bottle size.Rather than get entangled in a time consuming return/reship matter...I cut the straw length to fit. Not a problem here.It worked fine and does what it is supposed to when mama tried it.However, baby didn't seem to get any milk when not tilted...tried several different techniques and approaches ... still no help.don't know if it is an individual baby thing...or ?????Have used it successfully in the past on my children; however design was slightly different and not for a wide mouth bottle.Easy to clean and assemble."
1,Does not work,"Got it for my lazy daughter who does not want to tilt up her bottle, but does not work at all!"
3,Good idea,"I like the idea, and for the most part it worked, but I use the drop-ins and it doesn't work well with the bag. And now my daughter is finally getting the hang of tilting the bottle, so she'll tilt it and move the milk away from the straw anyway."
1,Baby Bottle Straw,"We found the baby bottle straw for wide neck bottles to be a great idea. Unfortunately, the straw is too small (narrow) and it was VERY hard to get the milk out. Once you had it primed and stopped sucking for a minute, you had to work hard to get the milk to the nipple once again. Our baby is 12 months and couldn't be satisfied with the amount of milk he could suck. I found it very difficult when I tried it."
1,Very boring!!! to read this until the end,"This is the first book that I stopped reading in the middle. The authors seem to know a lot about cost management and other tools. However, the way to link them together and present in a logical way may be the big problem for this book. It's like a book that reviewed all management new ideas i.e. ABC, BSC, TQM .... and tried to link to the concept of cost management system. But I would say that it really didn't work!!!!!"
4,"Mask, Rain","This new artist is the bomb. After listening to the words of these particular choices what caught my attention was hey! this is life. We all wear masks for reasons we may know or don't know. The music puts your mind at ease, makes your day just a little easier to get through. In a word just breath it will be alright. I carry this CD with me everyday thru my long comute and trust it helps. I've had the opportunity to meet both Kwame and his producer Danny. These brothers are giving you reality you just have to be willing to grab hold and take off the Mask..."
2,Backwardness vs Modernity,"While he offers all sorts information about rural life, Eugen Weber homogenizes rural French culture, which was not all as bleak and backward as he suggests. In fact, each region of rural France had its own political, cultural, and economic dynamics, rich traditions, and internal conflicts. Economic modernization and prosperity came to small town and rural areas of France before the 1880s (which were in fact a time of agricultural downturn), and there were rich as well as poor Frenchmen outside the metropole. The problem is that Weber uses his own familiar modern categories to explain rural 19th-century French life; and he finds these categories in the observations of bourgeois city-dwellers. He is not wrong that language, shared experiences (like military service), and collective frameworks (from common education) are essential to national consciousness; but he does not do justice to the starting material of non-Parisian France."
4,OK deal,"My 3-year-old loves Play-Doh and had really wanted the scissors (he had used some in a church class). This was the only set I could find that included them that didn't include a bulky container. The scissors don't seem very well made (I expect it won't take him long to break them), but regular blunt-tipped children's scissors work great (wish I had thought of that before!). I think the price was good for all of the accessories as well as 4 tubs of Play-Doh. I just wish it was all made in the USA!"
5,Great Fun for Two Year Old,My 2 year old loves this Play Doh kit. It keeps him engaged for longer than almost any other toy. He loves the scissors and the rolling pin. Great value.
4,Fun,When there is nothing else to do there is always play-dough! It has not been ever boring. You can't go wrong with this toy.
5,Complet and fun starter set.,"This is our sons first Play-doh ever, so this set was great! Just enough Play-doh and accessories for a (supervised) 22 month old. Great starter-kit!"
5,Leather Tote,This is a beautiful leather bag. It's light and well made and carries a lot. The brown and black together make it an extremly versatile bag. I am very glad that I took a chance and ordered it. Well worth the money.
4,Fits/looks Sexy/nice but not durable,"Love it - it looks sexy on, but warning it will only last for 1 or 2 wears so not very durable. But I will order again."
1,user,"The magnifier,lamp, and arm all work great, problem is: the mount that attaches to the bench is made from a weak-thin plastic and about the second time you adjust the height of the arm it breaks the bottom of the mount, then you have a useless piece of equipment."
5,Slowdive - 5 EP (In Mind Remixes),"Slowdive, the shoegazing giants from the early-90s, have their track ""In Mind"" taken to the cleaners by Bandulu and Reload on the 5 EP. Bandulu take the minor chords and stretch them into a dub-inflected whirlwind. But the standout is the Reload mix: a shimmering, blissful track with downtempo rhythm and futuristic soul. Breathtaking."
2,Not what I expected.,"I bought this for a native Israeli who missed the sounds of home. He said it was just a lot of songs from the 1940's and 1950's that didn't represent a guide to the music at all. It was old fashioned, and not what people listen to in Israel at all; maybe they did 45 years ago."
1,Product Breaks,"I installed this pump with perfect filtration, piping and overall ideal circumstances. I lasted less than 6 months and the impeller disintegrated .... Nearly $300 for a pump that is of such poor quality and has no warranty. Very disappointing."
1,Decent for a short lifespan,"I bought this pump (WLS-150) three years ago. Right after the 1 year warranty expired, one of the cast iron bolt ears broke off and it started leaking. I believe the bolt was torqued too tight at the factory and the expansion and contraction from the hot days and cool nights eventually weakened it until it broke. I welded the ear back on and it was back online. The pump worked fine for a while. Now the impeller hub has separated from the plastic impeller and will not pump. Parts are hard to find. Not to mention the day the motor would just hum and not turn. Done with this brand!"
1,Did Not Work,"Pumped failed to work. It has a cheap plastic outside cover, and other parts appear that this pump will not stand the test of time being outside. I will never be able to test this theory because the pump failed to work...it was made in China. I bought an American made pump about the same price...better parts (iron) and it worked first time out. Please be advised before making purchase.The return process was simple with Amazon. I merely had to click a few buttons and UPS picked up the pump the NEXT DAY from my door step."
1,Bargain not always a bargain,"I purchased this as an ""open box"" item which would indicate it to be new (other), however my Amazon reciept later indicated it to be used. I spent several hours on installation (mostly troubleshooting). I set it up for 230 volt operation. It ran on a cold start for a few minutes then shut down. On a warm start it would not do anything but buzz until the internal breaker would shut if off. I am still waiting to find out if it was ""new-open box"" as seller implied or used as Amazon reciept indicates. Seller has been notified of the defective pump and I will update this review based on sellers response to the problem."
1,defective,"I am a contractor and have purchased 6 or 8 of these pumps. They are very inexpensive and put out a good amount of water. A 1,5 h.p. failed after 15 minutes and my pump repairman said it was due to manufacture defect and could not be repaired. This glitch caused me quite a bit of time and money on that project. But I just bought another, a 2 h.p. because of the price."
1,Over heated pump,Pump ran 30 minutes then kicked out on the heat overload. I would not recommend this pump. i have a Flowtec And a Myers pump with absolutely no problems.
1,arrived damaged,pump arrived in box that was torn up...went ahead and paid electrician to wire it...then ...plugged in...nothing....pump must of been damaged during shipping....was not happy with it at all.box was woefully inadequate.
3,good service,The first pump did not work. It was replaced fast and now workes very good. The serice was very good. ron
3,Wayne WLS150,"Bought this pump 4 years ago, the impeller has seperated from the shaft. Not an easy fix. The parts manual is less than helpful for service and maintance. Is has no information on disassembley or assembly."
4,More Than Just A Lawn Sprinkling Pump,"We have had this pump for about two months now. We upgraded from a 1 1/2 hp pump. We use to irrigate 15 acres which include grass, an orchard, and a 175 vine vineyard. It handles all of it very well. We would have given a 5 star rating but for the fact that it was poorly packaged for shipment and arrived with the plastic end cap broken off. We needed to install it immediately so we used a little electrical tape to reattach it. it has been working perfectly."
1,Does not run after plumbing is done,"With all the warnings against running the motor/pump dry, I didn't test it until I had it almost completely installed, including mounting on a dock with lake water supply attached. Turned on the power and, you guessed it, the motor just hums. Uninstalled everything, removed pump housing cover and discovered the impeller/slinger won't turn--the motor shaft is frozen. A simple power on test would have brought out the problem immediately, but with all the warnings against it, I had decided not to risk it. Now I'm back to my old ways of giving everything a short simple test before installation."
1,Two failures in a row! How do you give zero stars?,"I have now had TWO of these fail in succession. Both for the same cause - the impeller broke. On the first one the heads of the screws that held the internal impeller cover inside the pump were sheared of as a ""factory feature"". You could not remove it to get at the impeller. The second, a replacement pump, failed after less than thirty days. The company generoulsy offered to sell me replacement parts instead of a new pump. Forget it."
2,Irrigation pump problems,"I have not used this pump yet as I won't have water until the first of April.It is very difficult to wire this pump as the electrical connection compartment has very little room. It is almost impossible to get an electrical connector in the hole. Poor design.The mounting holes in the base are approximately 6 inches apart and under the pump body. You are restricted to short bolts because the holes in the base are under the pump body so the bolts will not go in the holes because the come in contact with the pump body. If the base were wider, the holes could be spread out another inch or so then longer bolts could be used.Disappointed so far. I hope the pump performs better than the design of the mounting and electrical.I wrote the manufacturer but they ignored me."
5,Great Reading When You Just Feel Deserted,"If I could only bring one book to a desert island, it would be this. Definitely."
2,A poor guide for beginners,"Mr. McIntosh is quite obviously a master of his craft. Sadly, though, he's an exceedingly poor teacher, and one would need to be both in order to write this book well. Needlessly (sometimes infuriatingly) verbose, the author buries critical theses in an avalanche of lyrical verbiage that achieves nothing other than obscuration of the point. Illustrations that accompany the text rarely help to clarify the written instruction. An application or two of the K.I.S.S. principle would have worked wonders here. Recommended only for those who already know how to build a wooden boat."
3,Great illustrations But!,I am fairly new to the language of wooden boat building and found the book a difficult read. The book would benefit greatly from a well illustrated glossary. The illustrations redeem the more obscure text but not enough to make it a fully understandable read
5,The Other Side of the Story,"History has been unkind to the Dudley family, laying a multitude of evil actions at their feet and never really giving them a chance to defend themselves. Enter Derek Wilson, Defender of the Underdog? Wilson's biography of this influential family logically and soundly refutes many of history's uglier interpretations of their actions. The book is well researched and includes many notes taken from Dudley family correspondence and other historical documents. In the chapters where Wilson presents alternative spin on commonly accepted interpretations of Dudley actions, he does so by including opinions of Dudley contemporaries, both friends and rivals, and by assessing the social, political and religious climate of the times. I found the book engaging and highly readable."
3,Uncrowned and surprisingly unknown,"What most of us know about the Dudleys comes from their supporting roles in the stories of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Jane Grey and Elizabeth I. To put it mildly, they have not been overburdened with good press. Wilson does his best to rescue the Dudleys from their ""Black Legend"" and in some regards succeeds. While I can't entirely accept his assertions that Northumberland did not plot to have his son crowned king through Jane Grey, Wilson's depiction of Robert Dudley as a wise advisor to Elizabeth I instead of a 16th Century boytoy is convincing.Like an increasing number of nonfiction books, this one could use a bit more time with a copy editor. One Dudley has ""died in the wool"" beliefs and Margaret Tudor has only one heir instead of two. Minor quibbles but annoying nonetheless."
5,Great molds!!!,"We bought these candy molds to make lolipops for my sister's ""Twilight"" themed party. They were a hit and so easy to use. We wondered how well the pops would come out as it was our first time making our own. But the molds were very nice, large, and the details came out very nice in the candy. Highly recommend."
1,Not that good,"The pendant is fair but the chain is thin and breaks easy the ""Diamond"" is toooooo small the picture shown is oversized i think they must show this picture with another one with the real size of the item."
5,great book about an incredible woman,"If you're looking for a book about an incredible female figure, this is it. I loved the way the author is able to make Irma's character come out so vividly, while at the same time giving the reader a sense of the political backdrop against which the events occurred. The book is also incredibly engaging -- it's one of those books that I keep thinking about, and wanting to jump back into. Each time I realize I have already finished it, I'm sad that I can't go home and read some more. It must have been incredibly exciting to have uncovered this story!"
4,lost tapes,"The tight production and smooth rhymes that I've come to expect from madlib/wildchild. If you liked Soundpieces, you'll like this album too. Nothing new or groundbreaking, but that doesn't stop this from being a great album."
4,Vincent Price Comes Back to Life,"Probably the eeriest thing about this book is that I could hear Vincent Price reading it aloud in my head. In other words, this book reads just the way one would imagine Vincent Price would speak (a ghost author, not a ghost writer). It's part memoir and part a history of Price's art collecting habits (he had good taste, recognizing Dieberkorn as a great artist long before he came into vogue--although Price's abiding love concerned Columbian art). There's nothing earth shattering here, but compared to the sub-literate frothings of today's celebrities, there's something quite refreshing about reading an intelligent and cultured book by one of their ilk. A fun read."
3,Cover your Gray Brush in Med Brown,"This is a very good product which does its job touching up gray hair near the roots. My only complaint was that the medium brown I ordered was too light for my hair, otherwise it does the job."
1,They Shouldn't Have Changed the Color,"I loved this product in it's old formulation, which was a beautiful golden brown color that left hair looking highlighted. The new formulation still masks gray very well, but is a dull color that leaves hair looking dull too."
3,"Mystical story, magical pictures, bad english","My son lives by this book, but i am afraid it is teaching him bad english skills. He walks up to random people and repeats the key phrase in this book: ""I am a doofus google eyed goblin!"" It kind of embarrases me when he does this. Overall, it encourages your kids to read, so if it's available, get it!"
3,No Power,"I probably should have assumed that this would not carry through the power options needed to run my LaCie firewire speakers, but the product didn't say either way. So I took a gamble and lost! They will not run as there is no power, at no fault to this product."
2,it worked once,It worked once and then nothing. I was trying to connect a external hard drive from my mac days that has a firewire 400 & 800. It didn't work for me but not 100% sure it was supposed to work.
2,Not bad... but not as nice as I wanted...,Not bad... but not as nice as I wanted... But I got a refund so no worry.
1,It did not work,It had a bad connection. It kept connecting and dropping over and over again. This firewire connector was not usable.
1,Adapters will not work,The firewire adapter did not work !! I had to purchase the correct firewire cable and my Studio one worked perfect; However it did arrive in a timely manner.
1,Didn't work,"No molding on 6 pin end, looked like a jack from a computer, but that wouldn't have mattered if it worked"
5,Absolutely love it!,"Not too small not too big, very sturdy. For $10 you cannot pass this deal up. You will not be disappointed."
3,"Great item, but with a couple flaws","I recently bought this product and was excited to see how sturdy it was when i got it. The moon and stars add a soft touch to our little one's nursery and it holds quite a lot of baby laundry. However, I do have to say that the vinyl inner lining that actually holds the laundry tore after a week while trying to get it out of the hamper. Also, the tubes that hold the inner bag in place keep sliding out. If the inner bag were made of mesh perhaps, this hamper would be awesome!"
3,Overpriced,"It's nice, not great. It's small, very small and for the price I would've expected something better. I need another baby hamper and I just can't see myself spending this much again, it just seems overpriced now."
3,"Works, but I was looking for a detangler.","My cat has developed tangles in his fur and I was hoping this would take care of them, but it doesn't. It is just a brush to brush the cat."
2,My cat does not really enjoy this,"I bought this to use on my ragdoll kitten because most of the reviews were really positive.But he hates being brushed with this thing and leaves as soon as he sees me with it. I think it might be uncomfortable because the rubber bristles kind of pull on the hair. He acts like it hurts so I don't use it. I tried it on my own long hair to see how it felt, and yes it kind of hurt.But my boyfriend, who has very short hair, says it feels good. Yes, silly testing method, but hey. SO maybe if your pet has very short hair than this would be alright, long hair, maybe not. I tried it on my dog, who has short hair and he didn't seem to mind it."
4,Good for Light Grooming,"I bought the Kong Zoom Groom to work together with the Furminator. For what I use it for, it works well. After using the Furminator, there is a LOT of loose fur all over dear old Puss. The Kong does a dandy job of giving kitty a nice soothing rubdown, and snagging all those little loose hairs that get on everything.Great price, works well for loose surface hairs. For thicker coats or for undercoat, you would need something with a little more oomph."
5,Excellant Product!!,"I have been searching for a product to help remove all the excess cat hair on my 2 cats. One has a thick undercoat and fur is always flying. I have one of those wirey brushes but it is not tolerated for very long. I absolutely love this product! Even my cat that doesn't like to be brushed, loves it! I practically put my other cat to sleep brushing her. It removes a Lot of fur! Love it!!! Buy it!!! :)"
2,Turned my gentle kitty into a ferocious beast!,"Based on the excellent reviews this product got, I purchased and eagerly tried it on my lovely, gentle tempered cat. She started to turn on me... growling, then hissing, scratching, and finally biting just trying to get away! Mind you she doesn't care to be over-petted, so I took a different approach a few days later but to the same result.She absolutely hates this product. She tolerates grooming pretty well with theLove Glove Grooming Mitt For Catsin comparison, so I can only conclude the very inflexible rubber prongs are too stiff for her coat, and probably over-stimulate her skin.The few strokes I got did show a remarkable collection of fur, much, much more than the love glove, but ultimately kitty's comfort is most important to me, so it gets 2 stars."
5,excellent finishing touch groomer,"I use this as the finishing touch groomer on my big wooly cat, after raking him with the Four Paws Ultimate Touch groomer (also sold by Amazon). The Four Paws groomer gets in skin deep and easily removes the loose undercoat fur. After the handfuls of undercoat are removed with Four Paws, the Zoom Groom removes gobs more loose fur of a more superficial type. We were fighting a losing battle against mats that seemed to form overnight before we got these two inexpensive & highly effective tools. He loves them both, even on his face. His very high-strung short-haired female co-cat even enjoys a few gentle strokes with each. Zoom Groom also does a good job of removing cat fur from furniture and clothes. (Furminator doesn't remove the deep layers nearly as well and is rougher on cat than the Zoom Groom. Wooly guy only tolerates Furminator. Princess-type co-cat hates Furminator.)"
4,Nice massage grooming tool,Cats like to be brushed with this although it doesn't pick up a lot of hair it is good for a massage for them.
4,Only brush the monster tolerates,"Great brush, as it is the only my cat will let me use on him. Very effective -- I scrape off a tribble or two every time I use it. The downside is that the brush doesn't seem to collect hair very well. It normally ends up on me, but that's a small price to pay for the benefits."
2,It's Okay...,"The Zoom groom gets some loose hair, but my long haired cat is shedding and it barely does the trick. It sounds like it works well for some other folks, so I won't say it don't work. However, I wish I had bought a more standard brush."
3,"Works, sort of","I have 2 short-haired cats that shed a ton. This brush works better than the metal brushes, but not by much. The weird nubs get hair off, but not nearly the same amount as other gloves/brushes. Also, the nubs do a bad job of keeping the hair on the brush so I end up having to vaccum the spot where I brushed my cats due to all the hair fallout."
3,Ok,I don't know if I'm doing it wrong but it doesn't seem to work well for me! I will just have to keep trying haha. But I read the reviews before I bought it and people seemed to like it. Plus KONG is a great brand I will pick them over most.
5,Every cat loves this,I have not found a cat yet that doesn't love this brush. I've bought it for several friends' and family members' cats and my own two cats love it. It's like a cat massage for the kitty - they love it - and it's nice for the human because the hair clings to the rubber teeth of the brush making it easy to collect the hair and toss it. All other brushes and combs are far inferior to this one.
5,Cats Loved It,"I have four cats and ordered this for one of our short-hairs. He is technically a short-hair but he has a ton of hair and he always looks so mangy. He likes to be brushed okay, our other cats do not at all. When I got this brush, he loved it!!! He doesn't even want to move except for to occasionally rub his face on it. The real surprise was our other cat who is very specific about how he likes to be touched really liked it as well, and I never brush him. It may not be for everyone but I definitely recommend it, our cats adore it!"
5,The trick with this is to follow it up with a wire slicker brush.,This is a great brush for really loosening the loose hairs from your pet. But you will need to remove the hairs from the cat with a wire slicker brush. Otherwise you'll have clumps of loose fur that get all over your stuff. My kitties are so silky and shiny after I brush them with this and my boy cat LOVES it. He comes running when I get it out and rolls around on the floor and purrs hard while I brush him. The other kitty it a little brat so I have to pin her down by the scruff to brush her. Whatever. I even bought this as a gift for a friend when he got his first cat because it's so great! It gets rid of SO MUCH FUR IT'S CRAZY!!!!!!
2,Not for my kitty,"Maybe it was just me, but I didn't find this brush to be very effective.I have a tabby cat, short haired...so she doesn't typically shed very much. However, she tends to have a lot of loose hairs in her undercoat. I think it was the large, long spikes on this brush as well as their wide spacing which didn't make it very good at getting at the undercoat. It picked up a little, but we have a ball toy made of the same material with smaller, closer spikes and it works much better to remove hair.On the positive side, the cat did like the massaging effect of the brush, but even then I found the big spikes to be awkward and even a little concerning that it was poking her because she squirmed away more often than not.Since my main goal is to prevent furballs, I can't recommend spending the $ for this brush."
3,Works for 2 out of 3,"I feel as though I have my own focus group in my house. Two cats and a chihuahua. One cat and the dog loved to be brushed by anything from the furminator to a regular comb. The second cat is another story. He hates to be brushed with anything. I thought perhaps the furminator was too rough for him so I bought this product. Unfortunately, he hates it as well. Note that this cat also is very particular about the way he is pet as well. He prefers feet to hands - I suspect he was abused by a former owner. He is 20 lbs and 13 years old so he's set in his way. It seems he just likes to keep his fur to himself.As for this product, the other animals love this brush, but it doesn't remove much of their fur. That being said, I am used to the furminator. This brush is definitely more calming so I will switch off when I start to see bald spots from the furminator!Overall for the low price, I think this product is worth it. Easy to hold, 2 out of 3 animals enjoy it and it's cute."
2,Cat is afraid,"She wont let me use the zoom groom for more then a few seconds on her, and starts to fight if I do any longer."
4,Handy Little Brush,"I have 2 long haired cats 2 medium hair cats. It does tend to make a bit of a mess with the hair floating all over,but I brush all of them out before vaccuming in a certain area so the hair doesn't get anywhere I don't want it to. May make a mess grooming,but try this bugger on your cat scratching post I've had hair on there for 8 years couldn't get it off vaccuming alone spent alot of time with roller,wetting my hand,tape,just didn't cut it. This brush if not that great for grooming does me a huge favor taking the hair of the post. Still satisfied with price and use of it. So I give it 4 stars."
4,like a massage,"One of our cats likes the ZoomGroom pretty well. He is a very social and pliable cat and purrs when being groomed with this product; it's much like a massage. The other cat is very skittish but still will allow this product for a short time. Yes, there is lots of hair; which is why I wanted the product in the first place. Better hair off the cat than in a hairball."
3,"It's ok, but too messy","I think I'd rather have something professional, this thing just didn't get all the hair off and seems to tear at my cat fur. The fur goes everywhere too, I would not buy again."
5,HAIR EVERYWHERE,"With a multiple-cat household, there is always cat hair. The ZoomGroom works well and really removes a ton of hair. I would keep a damp washcloth or towel nearby to help gather up the hair and to periodically wipe down the cat being brushed. Otherwise, the hair will float around and go everywhere! This device is often tolerated well by cats who otherwise will not allow brushing. It can also be used to remove cat hair from scratching posts and furniture."
5,Cats love it,"I bought this for my niece who got two new cats. They LOVE it. I bought a dog one too for my dogs, and they love it too...even the female who doesn't like to be brushed."
2,Has it's pros and cons...,"So my cat likes when I use this on him (which is surprising) but my only issue is that I have to brush his fur backwards to really get the fur loose enough to where it will stick to the brush. Just brushing the cat like I pet him doesn't create enough ""pull"" on the fur to do much. Once you get the fur worked up and loose, the brush traps it all fairly nice and makes for easy cleanup. I wish the ""teeth"" were closer together so it would create more pull, but I can't complain too much considering how much I paid for it. I will use it every now and again, but I will keep looking.EDIT: So the directions actually say you have to brush in a circular motion, so its my fault for not reading that. That does work, but it still seems odd."
4,Kitty likes it!,"I bought the ZoomGroom base on reviews. It sure is a tiny thing, no bigger than your palm. Our cat enjoys being groomed with it when he will allow it. Unfortunately, it does not remove hair as well as I'd hoped. I think the brushes with the bent metal tips work better on removing shedded hair. But for sheer enjoyment, you won't find a brush that will be better received by your cat!"
2,My cat does not like it,"I thought this would be great, but my cat did not like it. I have a hard time getting my cat to stay put to let me brush him with it."
1,doesn't work as a groomer,"The Zoom Groom, states it attracts hair like a magnet. It doesn't! I have a long hair and short hair cat. I used the product and it didn't pick up anything with the long hair and while it worked somewhat on the short hair it certainly wasn't a 'magnet'. It probably works for shampooing but isn't worth the money if you are looking for a grooming tool. ."
1,not what I expected,"This item did not pick up cat hair they way it was advertised too, and one of the prongs did not hold up through the first use. I would not buy it again."
1,All four cats hate this,"I'm not sure why everyone else seems to like the ZoomGroom so much -- all four of my cats can't stand it. Even the two who usually can't get enough attention, stroking, and laptime duck away when this comes out. Very disappointed."
3,"Works, but be careful","My kitten doesn't come running to me when she sees the Zoom Groom, but once I get it going, she falls asleep. We had this routine every day where I'd brush her with the Zoom Groom and she'd sleep on my lap. I'd get tons of fur. It was so much fur, I became concerned that I might be overgrooming her. I wondered if that was possible, so I emailed the breeder and they told me kittens her age shouldn't be losing much fur, so they told me I *was* overgrooming her.Now, I only comb her hair through with a fine tooth comb and lightly brush her with this brush and don't get much fur at all. Poor kitty looks a little thinner in her fur than when I first got her. It must be my overgrooming. Zoom Groom works. Just be careful not to brush all your kitten's fur out."
4,Definitely does its job...,"I used this on my short haired cat earlier today and it definitely helped me pick up all the lose hair from her fur. Quite a lot of hair actually, it was great.Downside? My cat hates it and wanted to kill me."
5,You'll never believe your cat had that much hair!,"I purchased a ZoomGroom for my cat. He was beginning to shed quite a bit and the slicker brush I had wasn't doing the job, plus he didn't enjoy being brushed with it. When I received the ZoomGroom we went into the bathroom and sat on the floor and he just melted in my lap while I brushed him. The amount of hair that was in the brush, on the floor, and on me was incredible, and when I was done I finished him off with aLove Glove Grooming Mitt for Catsto get rid of the loose hair still on him. He loved the massage and attention, so much so that he will pick up the ZoomGroom and carry it into the bathroom. I still use it even when I don't think he's shedding much and it finds hair I didn't even know was there. Just be warned, the first time using this the fur will fly!"
5,This Thing is AMAZING!!!,"Isn't it Great when you take a chance and order something ""promising much"" and it arrives and you find out that it DELIVERS!I own 2 cats, large male and smaller female. He loves to be brushed, etc., but she does not. I thought I would give this rubber groomer a try and I am glad I did. He, of course just loves it and gets excited whenever he sees me pick it up, and she has now decided that it is ok if ""Papa"" grooms her as long as he us using this little tool.I am so pleased to at last be able to groom both of my children and to get out all that loose hair and save so much time in not having to repeatedly vacuum my furniture to keep up with their shedding. Read other reviews here also and have no fear that this is just another ""bummer"" groomer...it is a ""Surefire 10"" on the Richter Scale of great pet items to own and use!You surely will be happy with this little purple thing! So will your cat(s), too!~operabruin"
2,Makes for MORE fur in the house,"This brush does get a lot of the undercoat and brings lots of cat hair to the surface, but the fur does not stick to the brush, so you're actually creating MORE cat hair dust bunnies. When brushing my cats with this I have to make sure to ""collect"" their loose fur with a different brush every few strokes so it doesn't just fly all around the house. However, one of my cats likes being brushed with this brush and purrs a lot when we use it, so I still give it 2 stars."
1,Junk! Terrible Customer Service!,"I paid $99 for Innova 8 quart pressure cooker and one year later the bottom seam split and a hardball size blob of metal oozed out on to my stove!I went to contact the company via the 1-800 number on the Instruction manuel,right next to the 5 year warranty...the phone number was disconnected!I tried all the address etc.I googled the company only to find a website that you send a message to them and they get back to you!No response , so I contacted Amazon, they tried their best to help, but they too found the 1-800 number they had for the company was disconnected and had no other way to contact them either.I have to give great credit to the Amazon customer service gal she really tried to help, even to the point of searching on the web for a contact number.Just save your money and buy from Mirro or another top maker.Stay clear from INNOVA INC.!"
4,Bhangra Lives.,"I teach water aerobics at 6 am in the morning. My class consists of warmup and stretching exercises - intense cardio... and then as a treat some Bhangra music (followed by deep water exercises - cool-down and stretching exercises - ending with pranayama - breathing exercises). The women love Bhangra. We do some free style dancing to Bhangra - the greatest pick up at 630 AM. What a way to start your day. We dance to some selections from this CD... and women have listened to some of the songs on youtube. The favorites are Rail Gotti and Capt Bhangra - more bhangra, please."
5,Fantastic dance music!,"An excellent CD. Good energy, fun songs, excellent production. The colorful sleeve design gives a hint of the fun inside. One of my favorites tracks is Juggy D's: Akheer. Who knew he was capable of such beautiful classic sound. His tough street persona belies this wonderful melodic performance and this is just one of many other introductions to the voices and sounds of Bhangra. Well worth the investment!"
5,I loved it.,I wished they went into more of his personal life and gave us a little background of his early years. It was really well done.
5,TSO,"I bought this music after I received TSO concert tickets as a gift. Love the music, now I cannot wait to see the show!"
5,Great Buy!,"This is such a wonderful set, it's nice to finally hear somthing diferent at Christmas, insted of the some old junk they play every year. The cds have alot of rock music, I really enjoy it, and so does my family! It's a great price for 3 cds and 1 dvd. Plus you get a booklet also. The dvd is tells a story to deeply touch your heart. It really gets you in the holiday spirit. It has a warm feeling that you don't get from just the ordinary Christmas music. This is a definite need for sombody that's in need for a change! If I could give it even more stars than only 5 I would.Have you ever been to one of their concerts???? It's awsome!!!!"
5,The Christmas Trilogy (TSO),"The 3 CD's in the set are excellent. Each one has the TSO mix of old and new, traditional music and traditional songs with a rock & roll edge. The DVD is very well done and a fun watch."
3,Product packaging,"Puchased this set just before christmas and I am glad it was not a christmas present. Deliverary was fine, but after opening I found two of the cds were missing although brand new and shrink wrapped. Returned to amazon with no problems for an exchange, after opening that one found the booklet that comes with the set torn out. Booklet is all there, just no longer stapled to the binder. That is the only reason for the three stars. As I said I was glad it was not a gift, it looked like it was repackaged!"
5,Thankyou for saving christmas!,"I was in a bind on what to get my girlfriend when tickets became available for their show. My girlfriend really enjoyed the songs on the radio. So, I decided to buy this trilogy. It arrived two days before i was e-mailed that the tickets had sold out. Faster than the box office!"
5,The Christmas Trilogy - Trans Siberian Orchestra,This is one of the finest collection of non-traditional and traditional Christmas music on the market today. The various and often unusual styles of the TSO make this a must have Christmas CD collection
3,Christmas Trilogy,"This is a good collection of 3 CD's and 1 DVD of the music of the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. If you like there musical combination of rock music and orchestra instruments then you will most likely enjoy most of the music on these albums. However the story line and lyrics are sometimes quite strange and you may wonder who came up with such crazy lyrics, especially considering they are suppose to be christmas albums. But overall this collection of albums is good listening if you overlook the lyrics and just enjoy the music."
2,Hmmmmmm.......,"I was a little bit disappointed with this.... I guess I had my hopes up or didn't understand exactly what I was getting. Not willing to return it for a refund, but still a little let down............"
5,Awesome music and great video !,The music was as great as expected! The video extra of a Christmas story was great as well. Highly recommend if you like TSO.
4,"Like the group, had to buy",this set in order to get a song I liked not offered on other sets they have. Haven't watched the DVD yet. Recommend if a fan.
5,No Christmas without this collection,This is the complete collection of Christmas music by Trans-Siberian Orchestra.+Comes in a nice book-style case+Best original new Christmas music+DVD is a plus-DVD only covers one of the CD's
5,A Christmas treat!!,"For those looking for a different...and wonderfully creative...take on Christmas music, then treat yourself...and your friends...to the Trans Siberian Orchestra! It'll become a new Christmas tradition!"
2,Trans-siberian orchestra,It was OK. Being an orchestra I expected alot more instrumentals. The singing or speaking of words was quickly passed over. I should have listened to it first.
3,christmas disappointment,I ordered this product as a Christmas gift for my husband and upon opening it on Christmas morning and trying it in the CD player he noticed one CD did not work and namely The Ghosts of Christmas. I was very disappointed and embarassed!!
2,Not What You Expected,"For those who have heard a few of this group's pieces played during the holiday season, be aware that the few pieces that are played are the best of what there is. The whole set was a disappointment as the rock genre works only for a few of the pieces and if you're expecting them all to be like the few played on the radio during the holiday season, you will be sorely disappointed at having a lot more ""different"" rock holiday carols than you'll ever want."
3,Christmas Trilogy,"bought this for my husband as he really wanted some of this music. He was a little disappointed - said it kind of all sounded the same. But he did like it, just not as much as he thought he would."
4,Amazing!,"I bought this item as a gift and my mother absolutely LOVED it! She was wanting to buy the three CD's anyway (right now she just borrowed mine hehe) so I bought her this and she was so surprised! She didn't even know they had this available and adding the DVD to the mix, for around the same price, was just the best deal out there! If you've never heard TSO's music, then you should buy this item because I guarantee you'll love it! And if you've been looking for some different sounding christmas music, then this is it! My family can't go through Christmas time without listening to Trans-Siberian Orchestra. :)"
5,Excellent,We love this product. We listen to these CD's throughout the Christmas season. No problems with this product. Trans-Siberian is the Best!
5,review for christmas trilogy,This 3 cd package is excellent. Music and DVD are awesome.The Christmas Trilogy (3CD/DVD)Would highly recommend to everyone.
1,Very Disappointed,"Re-decorated bathroom with an outhouse theme, when I found my order had arrived I was very excited until I opened package. It looks like something you would have in a child's room. When installing it, (turning the screws) the print peeled of the plate. Very Disappointed ! Total waste of money."
5,tolstoy,"I buy a lot from Amazon but I don't write reviews, however I feel moved to comment on this one. I stumbled upon Tolstoy's book The Kingdom of God is Within You and was very moved. A very significant book that influenced Ghandi etc. So I tried this one and if anything My Religion was for me even better. Tolstoy in his later religious phase is dismissed as some kind of extremist kook but this book has so many insites into life it is riviting. It is hard to imagine that a book classified as religion or perhaps philosophy could involve you so much but I had trouble putting it down. He gives such a logical and easy to understand account of what Christ was all about and what was said and what subsiquent historical developments artificially altered for personal gain...it just all seemed so right. Absolutely the very best of books and the turmoil the world finds itself in at the moment could use a large dose of Tolstoy. It is the right time for this book to resurface."
2,A triumph of witticism over criticism,"The absolute worst critic in the business today, not just because I disagree with most of his assessments, but because he's consistantly inconsistent in his likes and dislikes and his writing is as clear as a San Francisco sky in summer. The haiku like reviews, which are more about Chrissgau's clever hipsterism than criticism, often left me asking ""Well what did the music sound like?"""
3,"revolves around a power struggle, lacks awe","Poul Anderson always has potential when his books begin. This book bordered on its potential well through half the book. Slowly its potential tilted towards boredom and confusion, while going away from interest and awe.The science was a gripping factor to the book, it's what kept me going through the sometime tedious pages. The plot heavily revolves around a power struggle between companies, aliens and humans. The science fiction is left behind the facades of the rise to power over a huge piece of super heavy metals around an old supernova site."
3,It sounds good,It was nothing too fancy about this unit. I bought it to go with my toshiba television but I could have bought any brand. There was no advantage to have both the same manufacturer. I could have found a better unit for less money.
5,"awesome value for ""in a box""","Great sound, great functions and plays all my dvds old and new along with mp3 cds and an fm reciever! cant beat it at this price!!!"
1,Shredder,We defininitely had a defective model. We are shredding only paper & find that we can only put in 10 sheets of paper at a time before the overload light comes on and stays on. The basket has been emptied but shredder actually will not restart until you either unplug it or wait for several minutes. Even the reverse mode will not get the paper out. Have sent shredder back and am waiting on credit for return. Definitely not worth the money and hassel of trying to get the stuck sheets out.
2,Terrible craftsmanship...,"This toy is terribly made. The connections between the pieces of track always come apart, because the connectors are so flimsy. Also, the ""rails"" on the sections do not always line up, so cars may hit them and lose speed, causing them to fall from the track. It's so bad that the car that is included barely makes it around the track once or twice before it falls."
2,Don't buy this.,"This Hot Wheels set is so cheaply made that the track never stays together and the grey pieces holding it up fall off. An adult has to constantly be there to reset the track. Also, the set is made so two cars can ""crash"" yet it only comes with ONE car. I've been to two stores looking for a second (because of the 20 or so Hot Wheels cars we have, not one of them fits this track), and no store has them in stock, or even knows what I am referring to. If my father (the grandparent) hadn't spent 45 minutes trying to figure out how to put it together, and then another 30 minutes a week later taping all the parts together, I would have returned this the minute we tried it out for the first time. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
4,This toy is fun,"My 5 year old got this toy for his birthday and we've had a great time with it. He loves to watch the round thing fly off when the cars crash into one another. We have plenty of hot wheels cars that work in the toy so no problem there. It hasn't fallen apart on us yet, but it does use up batteries. Hot wheels toys are about fun. I guess you could say that it has educational value because the kid is learning about physics with this toy, but that would not be fun. I assume we'll play with this for a short while and then put it away - but I think the WOW factor was worth it."
3,"Not bad for the price, but lacks a couple of details...","I got this case on Ebay, and found that it's a good, servicable case. The attachment mechanism is based on the flipcover that comes with the TX, and has managed to hold the TX in it's case nicely. While the case only fits loosely on the belt clip, I've found that oversnug belt clip attachments tend to break. (I lost count of the number of cell phone holsters I've killed this way when the belt clip snaps!)The only quibbles I have are:1) The case latch could be more secure. I've had the case pop open when I brush up against things or take off my coat.2) I've had one instance of the screw-on post unscrewing itself, so it helps to check sometime each day.3) The TX -- literally -- rattles around in this case a little.Please also note that this is a metal case, so it *may* interfere with WiFi and/or Bluetooth. I can't really prove or disprove this though."
4,Good protection,"The case is very sturdy and protects my t/x. Easy to fold open and work on my palm. Only problem is the wifi range is reduced considerably when inside the case, but it would be in any steel case. I just take it out and it works fine."
5,Great Product- Very Happy with Quality and Function!,I purchased this case recently and love it. It keeps the Palm TX very secure and protected. I have had no problems with the latch. The outside is very tough and durable. The inside is padded and holds the Palm TX in a snug fashion. It is well made and does exactly what I need it to do. I would buy it again. Overall its a great product!
5,The exercise gospel,"The reason that I am so in love with this CD is because, the music just keep you moving and groving. I would also recomend this CD for those who are finding it hard to praise God and who would like to get stress and day to day problems as far as possible from them. I am going to buy it for myself that is the reason that I am recomending people to buy it. Love and Peace."
4,Pinoy Kamasutra,"Some people hear ""Kamasutra"" and expect porn - this movie is not porn - basic it is ""R-rated"". The premise of the dvd is to show a little ""T&A"" while demonstrating some sexual positions for couples looking to spice up their love life. The highlight is seeing the ample attributes of Katya Santos (from the show ""Juanita Banana"" on philipino tv). Using Amazon's scale of 1 to 5 stars: I give it eight stars for Katya (four stars for each breast) and one star for the movie. If you want a skin flick, this not for you. If you are a fan of Katya - I would (and did) buy the DVD. Tagalog language."
5,Seriously Underrated,"I can't believe more people don't know about this! I haven't listened to Fred's other solo album the whole way through, but the song I most remember--Monster--while it is a good song, it in no way measures up to the hard-edged punk rock sound of this recording. It's a huge departure from the usual B-52's stuff."
3,This guy really likes the Sex Pistols,"I first heard this CD sometime around it's original release. I distinctly remember hearing ""Coconut"" for the first time and thinking that it was everything quirky, original, and exiting that I liked in my rock music. My tastes have changed since then but I still think this Harry Nilsson cover rocks. ""Radioactive Lady Eyeball"" is another standout. One of the backing bands on the album is Shadowy Men On A Shadowy Planet, (from Kids in the Hall fame), who play on ""Sugar in My Hog,"" among other tracks. The sad thing about this CD is that I really think that the bands that back Fred are the best thing here. Throughout most of the songs I was feeling that Fred's singing was the only problem on this otherwise excellent TRUE punk album. If you have any doubts about the musical ability of the obscure backing bands here, just listen to the intros of ""Sugar in My Hog"" and ""Bad Dream."""
5,He feels alright and I feel great,"I was introduced to Steve Earle in 1989 in the best way possible... live in concert. Of course I had heard songs like Guitar Town and Copperhead Road before, and I liked them, but after hearing the run down live of some of the less radio friendly songs and feeling the power and charisma that is so uniquely Steve Earle, I was totally hooked. I went out and bought every single one of his albums to date. When he dropped out of sight for a few years I was very disappointed, being used to a regular, ummm fix, shall we say? of the guy. Train a Comin' was a delight, appealing to my folksy-country heart, but I Feel Alright is proof that Steve Earle can rock it like no one else on earth. And he deserves a medal or something for that incredible duet with Lucinda Williams."
4,I Feel It's a Darn Good Album,"Steve Earle went all the way to the edge of chemical oblivion and managed to pull himself back from the brink. He sings about it frankly on ""CCKMP,"" which stands for Cocaine Cannot Kill My Pain, one of the most harrowing songs ever commited to wax (plastic?). It is the centerpiece to ""I Feel Alright,"" which marked the return of Earle as a creative force after all of his personal troubles. No, it is not a happy album, but it also isn't a world class bummer fest like Neil Young's classic ""Tonight's the Night."" The best of the remaining tracks are ""Harcore Troubadour,"" the title track, the ballad ""Valentine's Day,"" ""South Nashville Blues,"" and the duet with Lucinda Williams,"" You're Still Standing There,"" the astonishment of which could be directed at Earle himself. Not every track is a classic, but enough of them are to make it a first rate album."
2,The usual misunderstandings,"This video started off good...they talked about different practices and the difference between voodoo, wicca, and pagans. Also had history of salem trials etc...but it was a made for tv documentary and played as such. Not one topic went into any depth whatsoever. Images of halloween witches and the hosts ignorance of teh craft hindered this production. I would not recommend it to anyone."
5,Awesome!,"I bought this book almost 2 years ago and this really made me serious investing for the future. Easy to read yet very thorough. Best book for newbies on mutual funds & stocks. I am so glad that I came across to this book. I really appreciate the author to write such an awesome book. My investments on mutual funds are doing extremely well, I am starting investing on stocks as well. Thanks alot!"
5,great introduction to retirement funding,"Time is Money has a load of basic financial concepts in its coffer. It was a pleasure to read, and the short quizzes at the end of each chapter really helped my focus and made certain I got the main concepts of each chapter. I am very annal about picking books because reading an entire book is a big investment of time, which I don't have a lot of to dedicate to pleasure reading--the time was definitely worth it. I've since recommended this book to friends.Good luck! Jason"
5,A read from Abroad,"I am in Seoul Korea, where English books are not easily found. I stumbled upon this little treasure. I am starting the 4 step plan this month. As a result of this book I have overcome a lot of fear and recommend it to everyone. Its hardcore so even the math-account types will like it!"
2,Don't start here,"This book has the best of intents, but no delivery mechanism. It is marketed toward the novice financier. The young people who have the motivation to take the next step towards financial independence, but no formal education in the world of money. This book assumes your an expert with tax brackets, investments, and bonds. In addition, the advice is very quickly becoming outdated with the economy the way it is. TAKE HEED! Be prepared before delving into this book. Very helpful, although it requires a great deal of prior knowledge."
4,handbells,Good product except the kids have ended up causing some of the letters to come off the handles. It would have been better if the letters were stamped on the handles instead of placing stickers with the letters on it.
5,My students love the bells!,This set is great for my use as a special education teacher (elementary) and Sunday school. My students like the color coding with the lettering on top as well as the sounds. It is an inexpensive but an effective alternative to teach and expose my students to the joy of music.
3,More toy than musical instrument,"This is a good inexpensive handbell set for children to learn the basics of ringing; it's makes a good musical toy for youngsters. Unfortunately, the tuning, especially of the middle C, is not good. It is not noticeable, certainly not by untrained ears, until you play the middle C and high C together - a cringe-producing sound. Good fun but not much of a musical learning tool."
5,"Nice Bells, great price","We just got these for my daycare. The kids love them, but with my age set (mostly 2-4 and 5 years old), it's been hard to do anything more than just let them ring them all at the same time. I think these would probably be perfect for 5 and older where they could work together to play a song. We'll keep trying to do more with them and see what happens. Currently they get a little annoying for the adults and don't keep the kids attention as long as they probably could."
4,good,"such a nice and fun toy, my daughter (2 years old) is very happy with it; for the long term the parents wouldn't appreciate much noise in the house :) but i guess it is worthy it."
3,Loved them but...,"My daughter LOVED these bells, but they handles loosened from the bells easily. They eventually became so loose they fell apart every time she tried to ring them. -_-"
2,Schylling Hand Bells,"The quality of bells is not good. Especially, the pitch of the bells and sound the bells produce. Bells from RBI (Rhythm Band Instruments company) sound much better."
5,Bells will be Ringing,The kids had a blast with these bells. We are using them this month for out youth program at our church.
4,A fun activity for our grandchildren!,These bells added joy to our Christmas! Grandchildren from 13 years to 2 years had SO much fun presenting a 'concert' to their great-grandparents and parents.I was disappointed in the container in which they came. It didn't provide adequate protection. I also anticipated there would be some music included so had to borrow some which worked out ok.I look forward to playing with the bells again real soon.
5,Wonderful bells,"I bought these along with the Schyling ""Piano Horn"" (which is really a melodica) and a good glockenspiel. These hand bells sound wonderful and they are beautiful to look at with their bright colors. They're easily identified by the label and color, but it's a little hard to play melodies with only one set of hands.With older children it would be quite possible to form an ensemble and have four to eight children sound the bells to make melodies.My pre-schoolers love to grab one or two and just sound them out. I have to ask them not to bang them together or bang them on anything. This will chip/mar the paint. Otherwise they appear quite durable. For this age, the glockenspiel and melodica are a little more value as they can be used to produce melody without much difficulty. The hand bells require more coordination. However, for individual notes or just fun play, nothing could be simpler."
3,"Bells were a hit, yet have taken a hit!","Originally, I gave this product 5 stars. However, after using them a bit longer with a group of PreK, I need to adjust that. Some of it should be expected, perhaps. The boys tugged on the clappers a bit. The clappers have bent and won't straighten again. The paint is chipped. I had to quit using them because they couldn't take the abuse. :-("
3,not enought bells and whistles,"It seems like a pyramid scheme... you really have to buy the seperate song book and the storage case. We have this sitting on side table in our house. They just look messy and I'm not sure where to put them. The stickers came of ours too, right away. We got them as a birthday present for our two year old and she has a hard time ringing them. Maybe in a couple of years. I will say adults in our house seem to like them. Anytime we have someone over they get used."
1,Dull point - a 10 cent sharpener has a better point.,"Just received this sharpener. For 40 plus bucks I hoped it would cut a nice point, but it is rounded and dull. Bummer.I would rate it as a Do Not Buy!"
2,poor quality,I purchased mine at Costco thinking that I was getting good quality. I wish I had read these reviews first. It did't last very long. My sharpener that I bought at the grocery store lasted years longer than this thing.
4,"Loud and Slow, otherwise good.","I am an art teacher. This sharpener works fine, and I like the self-feed and auto-eject. However, it is very loud and very slow, which I find annoying. Also, I use it in an art classroom, and it is getting worn out. Now when it is sharpening, the lid wiggles until it unlocks and the sharpener stops, so you have to twist it back on and it will start again."
1,Disappointment -- Non auto feed version,"I bought a version of the iPoint that did not have auto feed -- it merely had auto sensor shut off. One is supposed to press the pencil down lightly while it turns. It turns, and it turns, and it eventually sharpens the pencil, maybe after a minute. Ever try to keep your finger on the top of a turning pencil for a whole minute?I have yet to find a modern electric sharpener that was any good. I'm going to try to find one of those heavy duty old manuals."
3,OK but not superior,"The auto feed feature is neat, but has quit several times, requiring some jiggling of the pencil. Overall, a good sharpener."
1,Great Except For One Huge Flaw,"I just received the iPoint 14203 School version of this product last week. It worked BEAUTIFULLY for ten minutes. Then, a too short pencil was put in it and the auto feed won't spit it back out. I've tried tweezers, sticking a paper clip into the eraser, unplugging it and plugging it back in, smacking it on the bottom of the unit. Nothing works. I emailed iPoint's customer service and they said they'd send me a new one if I mail this one back. That's great and all, but really, for a pencil sharpener made for school use, there should be a way to get a pencil out that gets stuck. Maybe a version that doesn't have the self sharpening feature might be better but this version is a waste of money."
1,"Terrible, small basically soft disposables.",Wash cloths for a baby perhaps but certainly not an adult. Very small and much too delicate to be useful for anything really. These are more like disposable bathroom tissues.
2,Very thin,Luckily I had an Amazon coupon from the Baby Talk magazines and got these for free- I would have returned them if I had paid even a penny for them. They are very thin and small.
1,Wash Cloth,Not what I expected...thought it was full sized wash cloth and it turned out to be for babies. oh well. :-(
5,Perfect,I use these to wash my face morning and night. They dry very quickly between uses which is important to keep mold off of your face and they are really soft. I don't like huge heavy wash cloths for my face and I have very thin skin so I don't want to rub away what I have left. I love these and the fact that they come in all white too. Next order I am going to stock up on these.
3,Not what you expect,"I thought that I was getting traditional wash cloths with this order. Instead, they were very delicate facial cloths. They are much thinner and smaller than wash cloths. You would take perhaps an hour to wash in the shower using these. Instead, they should be seen as delicate facial cloths...in fact, they are so delicate that I could use them to dust off screens and clean eyeglasses.Seen as a fine, soft, little cloth for screens, glasses, and spot cleaning the face, these are fine. If you wanted a big, floppy washcloth for the shower or tub, these are definitely not what you were looking for..."
2,Not 100% Cotton,"I bought these even though some people had commented that they were not all cotton, because the product description of the white ones said 100% cotton, so I hoped that maybe only the colored cloths were a poly/cotton blend. But these white ones are also 80% cotton, 20% polyester. They are thin, which I did expect for baby cloths, but I think they are too thin, and cheap feeling. I wouldn't repurchase or recommend these."
2,"Not 100% cotton, not that soft","These are not 100% cotton, package says 80% cotton, 20% poly. They aren't that soft, either. Returned these. Try Aden and Anais muslin wash cloths if you're looking for soft. They're expensive, but after two washings they're like butter."
2,not what expected,To small and to thin not sure for what I should use it I bought it for my face but for sure its for something else still don't know for what Need to look for something different But if you look for something small and thin its a good choice
2,Poor Quality,I should have maybe ready into this item more as these washclothes are suited for a baby or infant not an adult. They are very small and poor quality; not suited for adults. Not even sure they are suited for babies. Overall junk in my opinion. Would not recommend or order again.
4,Does the job,I bought these for my baby to use them for his bath. They do get the job done but they are little thinner for my need but they are doable. Not 100% cotton though!!!
2,"Very small, but well & speedily delivered","I suppose it might have been obvious to one familiar with product names, but a description of size and purpose would have been helpful in making a selection. First to arrive, and well-packaged, nevertheless the items were not as envisioned when ordering. Fortunately, I have relatives with babies on the way, so now I have gifts!"
2,Ok Product,The wash cloths are very thin. If I would have realized they were so thin I would have passed on them.
1,Kushies wash cloths DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"These are very very small and unusable washclothes. They are not cotton or they feel totally polyester even that package says they are 80% cotton. I strongly advise against bying these, as I have no idea what I will do with them, but let kids play and use it as a doll washclothes."
3,Good anthology on CI,"Rather than looking up articles piecemeal on the Internet, I found this book offers a convenient collection. By reading all the articles, I got a sense of how competitive intelligence in performed as well as some of the benefits. A lot of the efforts might not be justified by a cost-benefit analysis while others can become great investments in a business.Competitive intelligence as presented in this collection is carried out by large organizations. It can be systematic and use long term strategies if provided a sufficient budget. I got the impression that it would be one of the first general and administrative areas downsized in an economic downturn."
3,A favorite among neighborhood squirrels,"Birds weren't all that interested but squirrels loved it enough to gnaw through ther feeder's plastic frame to get at this yummy treat. It was gone in a flash. Unfortunately, it was intended for birds. So if you trust the strength of your feeder I would try this"
2,My birds No Likey,"Ive had two of this product out for a month and the birds haven't even touched it. I'm new to feeding birds so I have nothing to compare it to, but so far this product is trash thinking about just putting it on the ground and letting the squirrels have them.."
4,"Very expensive alarm clock, but cool!","This alarm clock is the perfect prop for my three year old son's bedroom. He loves the way it projects the time on the ceiling and he is actually learning how to tell digital time! Considering that Amazon has the best price by far on this alarm clock ($10 cheaper than most places), it is still very expensive for what it does.Here are a few cons (I feel) about the alarm clock:1-Very bright light on the face of the clock at night (No adjustment)2-The projection on the ceiling can only be viewed in one direction3-The hour digit is a different size than the minute digits4-No radio, just alarm only.Considering you can buy a decent Sony clock radio for (...) you have to think ""is Batman really worth it?"""
3,Fun clock but the projector has limited rotation,"The clock is just as cool as shown in the picture and the projector adds a lot of fun, but the projector can only be directly upward or slightly backwar, so if you keep your clock on a dresser by a wall, the Bat Signal cannot be projected to the center of the room."
4,Great clock,My son loves turning out the lights and projecting the time on the ceiling. This would also make a good gift in the 4-7(8?) year old range. My son is 7
5,Leaving All Competition Behind...,"There are numerous books out there that discuss the end times using Revelation and CNN as thier only sources. Hays and Pate write an exciting novel within the historical context of John's apocalypse. There's action, suspense, tragedy and yes, a lot of romance. I highly recommend this book. It leaves those other prophecy books way behind!"
1,Rebate offers a joke,"I purchased Virus Scan and Spam Killer because of an offer they were running for $10.00 off of Virus Scan and $30.00 rebate on Spam Killer. I submitted all of the documentation - receipt, UPC codes and coupons. I was told they never received the UPC codes - not so. Unfortunately I didn't take copies, go figure first time. Took forever for any response, they refused to take back products or process request.In summary, not a good company to do business with. Horrible customer service. Can't get through, takes forever last person I spoke to was telephone rep in Guam....Stick with Symantec...."
2,SpamKiller 5 is not an upgrade,"SpamKiller 4 is much better. I promptly reinstalled it after trying 5.0. SpamKiller 5 doesn't run in the system tray and doesn't notify you when your receive new email. The interface looks nicer but is slower and less functional. Recommend getting SpamKiller 4 while it's still available. (Update: One person told me they liked Norton AntiSpam, but all the reviews say it's buggy and slow, so I wouldn't recommend it over SpamKiller 4.)As for the VirusScan part of the bundle..."
2,Bleeccccch,"There are better and cheaper programs out there, keep looking.Not stable, more complicated (than other programs) to set up for email, rotten customer support.Before buying any McAffe security products go to their website under technical support FAQs and read the section on manual removal of the program. This is what I had to do.I shifted to PC Cillin, and it was so easy to install I assumed I had missed something."
1,AVOID THE SPAMKILLER PRODUCT!,"(Zero star rating if possible)If you have Outlook 2000, skip this product. It requires you have a MAPI e-mail account and not a POP3 account as most home computer users have. It seems to have a big history of crashes and unexplainable behavior. If you take the time to read the McAfee support board, you will see all the problems this product has.Avoid! Run away from this one! Burning your money would provide more value for you."
5,Best anti-virus suite I've ever tried,"Most of these reviews are not fair, PCMagazine and PCWorld gave VirusScan and SpamKiller editor's choice and 5/5 stars respectively. I downloaded latest updates and works great. Seemlessly works with my outlook accounts and found infected files and spyware that I didn't know about!!"
5,This book evokes a sense of belonging.,"As an English instructor in a South Carolina high school, I have found this collection quite useful as a tool to illustrate the great diversity of characters who live out the Southern experience. The themes of coming of age, race, violence, and the unredeemed sins of past generations are flushed out with intensity and fury. The strongest pieces included are Moody's ""Coming of Age in Mississippi,"" O'Connor's ""Everything that Rises Must Converge,"" and Faulkner's ""An Odor of Verbena."" If you teach English in the South, you must include this collection."
2,This book is quite boring,"Being a student of Mr. Walker, I had to read this book for his class, and failed the test on it. I would have read it, but I couldn't keep my eyes open when I tried to. I does have a couple of humerious stories, but most are very boring. TEACHERS: Please do not torture your students with this book."
2,The picture is different than the product!!! Spigot is not as shown,"I have ordered this item for my neighbor, I originally broke the one that she loaned me. The picture looks exactly like the one I broke. Once received it was not the same. The spigot is not gold twist, it is silver. Didn't really make a difference to me, but it did to my neighbor. Pictures can be deceiving!!!"
2,"Biased, biased, biased","While the visuals are lovely, the information in this video is biased against the Romans, in that it is very pro-Christian and dwells on the violence (rather than accomplishments) of the Romans. This should be titled ""Roman Scandals and Half-truths"" and is better fit for an ancient tabloid than serious history."
1,This book sucks,This book is to frikkin' expensive and it is to elementary for my students. It reads as if a kindergarten student in Arkansas wrote it.-Professor Chris McLallen
5,Ms. Mouse,"The concept is simple, but this is in my opinion one of the best childrens' books on the market. The drawings are creative and unique. This book has inspired my love of architecture."
5,Wish I could find it..............,"Well I can say enough good things about this book, It has been my favorite for as long as I can remember, it as the first present I ever gave to my best friend Kristin, I think it was her 3rd or 4th birthday. Now one of my close friends has become a teacher and I would love for her to share the joy of this wonderful book in her classroom! I am trying Ginny!"
4,Tacky the loveable Penguin,"Once again Helen Lester did it. This is another charming book of Tacky's adventures. This time Tacky and his polite fellow penguins are preparing for the visit of the Emperor penguin. Tacky ends up stumbling upon the emperor's clothes and decides to try them on. Goodly, Lovely, Angel, Neatly, and Perfect all mistake Tacky for the emperor and spend the afternoon entertaining him. Tacky enjoys it all until the Emperor comes. But before the Emperor can get mad at Tacky, Tacky charms the Empreror like he does the readers with his humerous singing, balloon hats, and jokes. The Emperor is thrilled not to have the same old boring routine and lets Tacky keep his clothing. Tacky is the hero of the day and never looked better wearing a kingly crown and a oversized robe that barely covers his Hawaiian shirt. Tacky lovers everywhere will enjoy this great story and will have them singing ""How many toes does a fish have? I wonder, yup, I wonder."""
1,I don't like this book at all,"This book is, frankly, annoying. It is written in a strange manner, mixing ""folksy"" dialogue and more straightforward language, with an awkward flow to it - hardly inducive to reading out loud.I found the characters either mean-spirited or annoying, and the storyline clunky. The ""song"" that Tacky sings at the end while doing a stupid dance is just plain difficult to sing. It is up to the reader to imagine a ""tune"" while reading the book aloud, but the lyrics are quite tuneless (contrast with, say, Boynton).Disappointing book, in my opinion."
4,Very Entertaining,My daycare kids love this book. I love reading it aloud. About the complaint of the song being hard to sing as long as you make it silly it works. If you read it through yourself once before reading it aloud you can make it flow. All the Tacky books are great.
3,mediocre,"i only liked a handful of songs on this album:track 6, ""my life""track 7, ""round and round""track 8, ""yelling away""track 14, ""rhymes and ammo""the rest... aren't very good. and the mos def track is prett disappointing."
3,very disapointed,I'm a very big fan of underground hip hop. I was very surprised at this album. Usually rawkus records is a very good record label that supports the unerground. It seems that they went a little main stream. They had at least 3-years to work on this album. They could have at least put a little more effort into it. Don't get me wrong I still liked it. But it wasn't the same underground sound that I'm use to from the first two soundbombing records. Thers's at least about 5 good songs on it. So at least give it a listen and make your own judgement. Peace out.
3,READ THIS ONE.,"First off who cares about labeling artists ""underground"". If an artist is good, he's sure to blow eventually. The problem with this album is the production, there are way too many hints of R&B. If anything, hard Rawkus type underground generally doesn't use lots of R&B, period. I guess they wanted more commercial success, and were trying to set the vibe of the album with the classic sounding single THE LIFE. Anyways it didn't really work, and some of the stuff is straight garbage. Best joints are My Life & The Life is crazy hot too. On The Block is nice. and same with Round & Round, Spit Again, and The Trouble is. Put it in the air is westcoast Quik style, but Rawkus is mainly East so??I expected more from the Roots Kweli combo. Crew Deep is nice, but gets boring cuz the lyrics are crappy and not performed well.About 3 stars. 2 Must Have Tracks"
2,couple good tracks...didn't meet my expectations though...,"pretty dissappointing third addition to the soundbombing series... i was looking forward to the new cut by mos def and even that track had a whack beat. the dj quik cut is so-so at best. the rest of the album is scattered with [junk] from missy, artists from the lox (a group previously affiliated with bad boy and puffy) and others. the only tracks i liked were by cocoa brovas, and the cut ""yelling away"" by kweli and zap mama. just save your money and download ""yelling away"". this album is nothing to write home about."
4,K FRESH CAN'T FEEL THIS,"Good stuff if you can appreciate it. Most people that I know can't feel this album. Granted that it's not as great as Soundbombing II or I, it's still worth a listen. So unless you love Cash Money Records and listen to constant Hip-Pop, go get this album."
1,Only one good song on this Cd.,"The only song I actually liked on this cd is Crew Deep by Skillz.It has a good beat and good lyrics.The Life by Styles is allright.Even though Crew Deep is a good song,I would not reccomend this cd.You can buy it if you want,but I gurantee you will be dissapointed."
2,Not worth it,omg.. this is probably the most mainstream underground cd you can find. i really dont like that many tracks on here. the ONLY tracks that are worth listening to is-Mos Def - Freak Daddy-The Life - Styles P. & Pharoahe Monch <--probably best song on CD-Round & Round - Method Man-They Don't Flow - Novel feat. Skillz-Rhymes And Ammo - The Roots feat. Talib Kweli
1,"Y'all gangstas must be trippin', especially 'dis Jayadeep G.","I tell a gangsta once (I tell a gangta twice), 'dis album ain't even good enough to be in da hip-hop dictionary, fo' real. In my opinion, 'dis album ain't got one good track. A real project gangsta knows good hip-hop when he see one, and this ain't it. If ya'll punks dig hip-hop, 'den ya'll must be diggin' in da wrong ditch. Da point is, if y'all really be gangsta, go fo' da real stuff... Don't waste y'all time. Ya'll g's got better thangs 2 do, fo' real. Aight. E.S.P. 4 life. One."
1,what happened??,"wow... when i got this album i almost cried.. no wonder rawkus is almost obselete now.. good job guys.. i think this compilation scared all of the artists away from your label.. for shame... i cant think of one good song on this... there are several mediocre tracks on here... but who wants to be mediocre? this has got to be one of the biggest let downs around 2002... if you want satisfaction minus the thugged out mainstream garbage, pick up any of the old soundbombing comps or independents finest vols 1 & 2"
2,Buy this album only to complete your Soundbombing collection,"Remember how the Rawkus Records' Lyricist Lounge album was underground and the second one was commercial? Same story for the transition from Soundbombing 2 to 3. There are so many problems with this album. First, what are Missy, Kandi of Xscape, and Noreaga doing on a Soundbombing record? And why is Jonell's ""Round and Round"" on here when it is more than a year old? And the tagged-on verse by Monch feels forced. The only good songs are from Kweli and Cocoa Brovas. I only downloaded this album and I'm mad that I even did that. So what's next for Soundbombing 4? Hey, how about songs from Ja Rule and Nelly, mixed by Puffy?"
2,Rawkus records has officially sold-out,"Sound bombing 2 was probably one of the best mix CD's ever made, composed of true hip hop artists. This cd is awful! How do you go from having a straight hip hop record to Missy Elliot on a track, this CD is definetley not fot the hip hop heads......Rawkus records has Officialy sold out!!!"
3,The same old thing.,"This was obviously a one last attempt at a good album by a bunch of one hit wonders. BoDeans were done after ""Closer To Free."" There was nothing special on the album, and frankly, it was kind of boring."
2,"Good Photos, not much else","History is fun, and photos help a person understand the past. Thus, I enjoy photos, because I analyze them in detail. Using a magnifying glass I actually look closely to spot interesting items normally unseen by the casual reader. Since I have done some intel analysis in the past, based on photos, I know good photos tell a story about what is going on. However, a book needs to be more than good photos. Unfortunately that is about all one really finds in this book. The text is extremely abbreviated, so much so it is nearly irrelevant. And that is the problem. History tells a great story; however, a few blurbs do not a story make -- at least not a good story.These books are designed to get teenagers interested in the subject matter (I think), but even teenagers need a good story line. The short passages in this book are not adequate to convey a story.Thus, two stars.AD2"
4,A talented band that needs to be heard,"Just great rock n roll, not commercial [stuff]. Well crafted songs with a heavy riff. This isnt music that is made to excatly fit into a certain mold, not music that is made to just make money.I have been trying to get people to listen to this band for years and once they do they dig it. I like a variety of music. These guys know how to write music and play it. Please all we need to support talent like this, not the [stuff] played on radio today.the Prisoner"
3,Making Portfolio Assessment Easy,"This is a nice little recordkeeping book that contains checklists and forms for monitoring portfolio assessment. It is a terrific guide for addressing the portfolio process. It makes managing and recordkeeping easy. It is a quick reference how-to-guide for the portfolio process. Pages 2-3 provide a framework for the continuum of knowledge,skills and attitudes that should be address during the portfolio process (Bloom's Taxodomy). My only complaint is that the typeface used on many of the forms is too small, too faint, and too narrow for the primary grades because many of the forms also have a self-monitoring format. This is a great book for teachers who want an easy kickoff for getting started with portfolios as a form of on going assessment."
2,Not a good choice,My puppy had this toy chewed up in less than 5 minutes. The material is very soft and she literally had it picked to pieces and strewn all over the house as soon as she could. I would not recommend this product for an active pup.
3,It's Okay,"It's very easy for my pup to get the treats out of this toy. They practically fall out and I have to use treats that are really large to make it harder for him to get out. The problem is, those treats are too large for my tiny min-chi pup to handle once he gets them out. Wish it had a smaller opening. Makes a good chew toy, though."
