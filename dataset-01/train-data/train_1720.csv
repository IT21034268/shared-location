1,Too Dark for My Taste,"I don't know what I was expecting, but this movie was pretty dark. I didn't appreciate the premise of the movie, and didn't find any redeeming reason to watch it. There wasn't anything that offered hope in my opinion. Just a dark story about a crazy person."
5,Excellent movie...,Really deep movie with a very twisted plot. Would like to see a continuation of the story. MAtt Damon is really creepy in this one.
1,Disgusting as hell.,"My wife (39) and I both hated this movie, not to mention it somehow made my 6 month old son cry long and hard. We had to pause and put him to sleep before continuing this disgusting movie in hopes of the ugly and gay Matt Damon getting caught SPOILER (WHICH NEVER HAPPENS, BTW). Don't hold your breath for that good ending.Just as a lie requires another lie to cover up the previous lie, this movie shows that a murder requires another murder (and a third, implied, murder) to cover up the previous murder. This is basically Cain and Able. If I wanted to read/watch a story such as this, I'd read the Bible.If you liked this movie, you are sick as hell and headed there as well. Go repent you moronic fools - or as the muslims would call you ""infidels""."
2,Maybe it is the story line.,This movie went no where. I ended up not finishing it so I maybe it picks up in the end.
5,EXCELLENT!,"This is some of the best work from Phyllicia Rashad and Debbie Allen. Set in the 1930-1940s, the two sisters live together in Harlem and are working hard to forgive past hurts and to heal from old wounds. Rashad (Bess) is the older sister who never married nor had children. Allen (Qwillie) moves in with her after a failed marriage. Bess agrees to take in a boarder to help with the rent...Bumper Robinson (Husband). Out of a well meaning gesture comes romance, arguments, and an ending that will leave you in tears!"
5,Great Movie The Old Settler!,"The was such a great movie to watch, at times very emotional. I thought both Debbie and Phylicia was wonderful in this movie, but Phylicia deserves an Oscar for the part she played. Love them both and just wanted to say they did a wonderful job. Can't wait to see them both appear in something else together. BIG UPS to both Debbie, Phylicia and the rest of the cast.Lynn"
4,Great Acting,These two sisters worked well together. It has the feel of a play but it is a movie. It leaves you thinking about the choices your mother had and how things are different now.
3,The sophomore jinks strikes The Outfield,"Following up a nearly perfect album like ""Play Deep"" is difficult to do, yet The Outfield almost pulled off an upset. While I found this album to be predictable and at times...boring, I must say that this album also contains my favorite 2 Outfield songs. The singles ""Since You've Been Gone"" and ""No Surrender"" are heart felt ballads that remind fans why they liked the first album so much. Unfortunately, most of the other songs seem uninspired. I found the song ""Better Than Nothing"" to be rather amusing, it may remind you all of your first sexual experience. The good news is, their next album, ""Voices of Babylon"" is much better."
5,Sophomore effort scores home run.....,"Even though Bangin' is the trio's second album and is therefore classified as a sophomore effort, it has no signs of carrying the typical sophomore curse. If anything it is Better than Play Deep.... It contains the classics Since You've Been Gone and No Surrender, but it also contains hits such as Bangin' On My Heart, Main Attraction, Alone With You ( a beautiful ballad), Somewhere In America, and Playground. If you liked Play Deep and you want to experience more of the fresh sound of the Outfield, buy Bangin'!"
2,NO where near as good as Play deep.,I thought that they were more than a flash in the pan. I was wrong. I really like the play deep album and this is not the same quality at all.
5,Wow....wow...,"Somewhere between Woody Guthrie, Victoria Williams, and R.E.M. sits Vic Chestnutt in his wheelchair, making some of the most unique folk I've ever heard. This original and literate 'concept' album grows on you with each listen, until Vic's sitting there in your living room strumming a guitar. Nearly every song's a mini-masterpiece, but I love ""Parade""...it builds and builds until Vic's nearly rising out of his chair with the intensity of emotion."
4,A genuine near masterpiece,"I've been telling people about Vic for years. One of the best songwriters around. This album continues to prove that. A wonderful, textural album, especially on the impressive ""Mysterious Tunnel""."
5,One of The Best CDs of the Year,"This record creeps into your soul after repeated listens and easily ranks as one of the best CDs of 1998. The middle songs are weaker than the rest, but the complete package is hard to beat."
1,Texas Hotel was a better home than Capricorn...,"I own every Vic Chesnutt CD, even ""Brute,"" the joint project he did with Widespread Panic. I love all the albums, especially ""Drunk."" I was thrilled when this CD came out, but had a really hard time finding it. I finally found it 300 miles away, up in Flagstaff. I got the CD and quickly found myself disliking it. The sound mix is horrible and muddy, there are few melodies, there is nothing there to equal the emotion of ""Thailand,"" and, in general, this was just a real disappointment. I thought I needed to listen to it and give it time, but it seemed to get WORSE with every listen. I finally sold it to the used CD store and now I own every Vic Chesnutt CD except this one. This is a turkey and is boring from beginning to end. Vic, whatever funk your're in, please come out of it! This album sucks big-time!"
3,El conejito Andarin,"I'm teaching spanish to my 22 months old son, the translation is great, but could be better if it is was a hard cover and not paper back."
5,I Hope when I die Lady Death comes for me!!!!!,If your a Fan of the comics (Lady Death) than you have to see this movie. It shows the origans of the sexiest death dealer ever.
3,an unfortunate fake,"With references to: Ice cream. Women seeing you photograph, Magazines, cigar wrappers, machinery, butcher shop, pencils,diamond rings,theater tickets, cheap lace and machine embroidery, Fifth Ave. West side, Harlem, East Eighteen street, the telephone, convinced yet? I could go on, but whats the point. I'm not saying it doesn't contain some very practical advice for dealing with the Ahem weaker sex. But don't fool yourself into thinking this come to us from before the flood."
2,These are too expensive!,"If you really love charmed, then you can buy 5 DVD seasons for the price of this three pack! They are going for so cheep now, you might as well. You don't get anything extra here, just the three packs wrapped together. Why waist money? It is just as convenient to add all three sold separately from Amazon to you basket and you save a ton. If you have money to burn then buy this set. I don't recommend it."
4,Now THIS is what I call MUSIC!!!,"I just bought this CD a few days ago, and have fallen in love wih it. Before buying this CD, I had really only heard Bei Mir Bist Du Schon a few times. Whoever wants to listen to some great songs, buy this album! Don't Fence Me In, Bei Mir Bist Du Schon, and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy are incredible. Too bad the music of today isn't this great."
1,Beware the Missing Songs,"Be forewarned, The Andrews Sisters: Greatest Hits, The 60th Anniversary Collection, does not have six of the songs listed on the Amazon product listings, including ""Rumours Are Flying,"" with Les Paul playing in the background."
5,The Andrews Sisters-Greatest Hits,"Very nice album. I really like the upbeat music and the great blend of their voices. I bought this version becasue it has ""After they See Berlin."""
4,3 Good Songs But Too Much Money,"Island In The Sun is a great song, but obviously noone will buy this cd for that song when they can get a whole cd with Island In The Sun for the same price. Teenage Victory Song is a very good song. It's a catchy rocker that has that signature =W= crunch written all over it. Starlight is also a meritable track. It has good lyrics and offers more straightforward Weezer rock music. All three songs on here are good, and any diehard Weezer fan should buy this, but for the casual fan, I think it's too expensive."
1,thomas tv game purchased at amazon.com,"When I purchased the Thomas video game for the TV, I purchased it for my grandson. Unfortunately it did not work as well as stated. Most of the buttons stick and makes it very hard to play. I was very disappointed in this product. I would not recommend anyone buy anything used from this site. They say it works great but as I found out, Not so much. If you cant buy it new then your best bet is to buy it where you can see touch and play before buying."
4,"There's Hendrix, Eddie, Michael, Ernie, ....Eric Gales","It is amazingly shameful that this guy has not been heard of or has not been mentioned as one of the greats. Without a doubt this guy can do ""strange"" things/sounds with the guitar as I seen this live at ""BB Kings"" in Nashville, TN. Like Hendrix, he has his own style as you can hear that Memphis influenced (a town of talent, like the Bar-Kays, and Eric's older brothers). Hendrix was not the only black guitarist who could do ""strange"" things with the guitar, but did make it easier for black guitarist to transition to the Rock, Rock&Blues, Rock&Funk, Rock&Jazz stages. EDDIE HAZEL***, MICHAEL HAMPTON, ERNIE ISLEY, and now Eric are just a few who do not get the credit they deserve."
3,Fairly Good!,"Gales makes no bones about the man that influenced his music so subtleties aside, he plays a white turned strat, hired an executive producer by the name of Janie Hendrix and performs a cover of Foxey Lady. Need any more hints? Nevertheless, this 25-year-old guitar player from Memphis Tennessee plays with the confidence and experience of someone twice his age. Kid Rock guitarist Kenny Olsen and Incubus' Mike Einziger and DJ Kilmore make guest appearances on the disc but Gales blazing guitar and silky smooth vocals remains the focal point throughout. Gales in not up to Hendrix' caliber, but at just 25, it's a worthy goal nonetheless."
3,If you haven't watched No Holds Barred...,"...then this is a good introduction for you. Rickson Gracie is the real reason to watch this. The epitome of fighting zen and cool, he makes other men look woefully inadequate. Rickson represents a Mike Tyson in an alternate universe - the one of no-holds barred fighting.As a documentary, it's pretty straightforward stuff. The most essential and engaging part is certainly the fighting.Fans expecting to learn more about the Gracie history won't learn much here, but this is about as good a look at Rickson Gracie as it gets."
2,Weak,"Young, inexperienced no-names are invited to get beat up on by the Gracie's best. I felt bad for these guys. Gracies are shameless."
2,Could be better!!!,"Well, unfortunately or not i had already seen a lot of this video on Youtube and i didnt know it, until i bought it The content is good but its not worth the money. Actually i bought it because im a brazilian jiu jitsu athlete and a big fan of Rickson Gracie, but i think the video could have shown more training aspects, what its really interesting for me. As a documentary is ok, but once more, its not worth the money,it could be a little bit cheaper."
4,Insightful Documentary on MMA,"An enjoyable documentary for any serious MMA fan. This documentary offers insight into the training and mind set of FC MMA fighters by focusing on three MMA combatants during the final weeks before their fights. The primary focus is on Rickson Gracie, who goes into detail about his beloved art, his training and mental preparation for a fight. Although Rickson's insights are somewhat interesting, his ""philosophical thoughts"" get kind of old after a while. I found the other fighters stories (Todd Hayes & Koichiro Kimura) more compelling. Nonetheless, the documentary is very interesting and enjoyable. If you're looking for some exciting Rickson Gracie fight moments in this video, forget it! The exciting fight moments are provided by Yuki Nakai, a 135 pound local Japanese combatant with the heart of a lion!"
4,Not just another boring documentary,"Choke was 1/2 MMA tournament, and 1/2 behind the scenes documentary. This dvd follows Gracie, Todd Hayes (kickboxer), and an asian wrestler who's in the tournament for the 1st time. After watching Gracie's training rituals, there's no way these 'mortal' fighters would ever have a chance of beating him. Although, Gracie finds himself caught in a front choke during the middle part of the tournament. Hmm..The only downside with this dvd is the competition. Perhaps some big name Pride or even UFC fighters would have made for more intriguing fights."
3,Rickson--Say No More,"The fights are kind of so-so (although Rickson does an over-the-shoulder escape that should be in the Hall of Fame), the fighters are no-names and Rickson doesn't always come off in the most flattering light.But who cares--it's Rickson Gracie. Seeing what goes on in the locker room between bouts and some of the training rituals make this worthwhile.Next time: make it all Rickson, and let's see more action on the mat!"
5,The most exciting and informative NHB video ever made!!,"Not only does this video contain awesome fights, but it also shows you what is going on in the fighters' corners. That is the coolest thing about it. You get to hear what they all think about each other as the tournament is unfolding. Seeing Rickson in action is incredible!"
4,"For all Gracie, MMA, BJJ, and Rickson fans","I bought this DVD some time back because Rickson Gracie is just awesome, one of my idols after the UFC made Gracie Jiu jitsu a household name among martial artists. Although this DVD is a documentary and does not have full fights, it's still good DVD to have for all martial artists, and Gracie fans. See how Rickson trains and prepares himself, and his thoughts before and during the tournament. I think it's a must have DVD because it shows one of the greatest in his prime. And you can also see how other fighers feels about fighting Rickson."
2,Doesn't compare too other brands,"There other many cardiology scopes available and personal preference ultimately determines which one works best for the provider. I have used ADC, Littmann and now MDF brands. The ADC scope's tubing was too short for convenient use and the sounds from these scopes seemed distant or faint to me. The Littmann cardiology models all had "" tune-able"" diaphrams. To be honest, this took some getting used to but once that happened the scope was exceptional. I was unable to test the MFD because when it arrived the Binaural Assembly was broken. I do not intend to reorder a replacement because I didn't see anything that set it apart from my Littmann. MDF does make a very good Rappaport model that I always use when on the ""street"" and I do recommend that one as a very cost effective stethoscope."
3,hmm......this is not what expected....,"Ekin Cheng became the next badboy after making movies like ' young & dangerous' ' Meanstreet Story' and such. i guess he is like the next andy Lau( BECAUSE EKIN CHENG HAS LIKE MARTIAL ART MOVIES WUXIA PEIN STUFF AS WELl) the other actor is very famous also. but i forgot his name..sorrywhat happens in the movie is that these 3 scientists invent a program tat can make people like the ultimate fighting machine. and the evil terrorist, Alien kidnaps one of them and kills one of them's fiance.filled with anger, ekin and fung(ill jus call him that) test out the program on themselves. so they can rescue their friend Kelly.the program domake them super fighter. but there are side effects.....and.....this movie dissapointed me because Hong Kong cinema in the late 90's has not made a well-made masterpiece yet.( maybe the young & dangerous, and storm riders....) Ekin cheng still is the man."
2,outdated,This book should be updated on a regular basis as the Doctor should know medications are changing quickly and his information is now outdated.
3,Not as complete as title suggests,Was disappointed to not find two out of three pills family members have been taking for over 6 years.
2,onclear,why is this book not updated??? drug companies are constantly changing prescription drugs...so what is correct today might be wrong a year from now..this book should be pulled off the shelves!!
5,I've discovered the joys of epilation.,"Sure, it sounds scary. It's not that bad, though. After the first time, you get used to it, and the results last so much longer than shaving. I love it.Maybe I'll actually get to wear skirts this summer!"
3,Not very efficient,I replaced my old Emjoi epilator with this one because I liked the idea of having a shaver in the same unit. The Epilady is not as efficient an epilator as the Emjoi. I have to go over and over and OVER the same areas to get all the hair and it doesn't pick up the finer hairs well at all. The shaver part works just fine. I'll probably get another Emjoi when this Epilady dies.
4,it's alright....,"I have had this product for a month now. I would say it's an alright epilator, not great, but good enough if you are not too fussy about having every tiny hair removed. It misses a lot of little hairs, and you need to go over the same area many times to get it done. I had an Emjoi epilator which was better, but died on me. The razor part leaves my skin a wee bit sore, but maybe that's because I'm doing it wrong? Overall, it's ok."
2,"Great Idea, BUT......","If you can get it to stay together then it works fine. Mine comes apart (the ends that connects to the cord) falls off about every 30 seconds as you are trying to use it. I have to try to hold it together as I use it and reconnect way too often for it to be easily used. There is not a pull on it to cause this problem, it just falls apart. The ends need to be tighter after they are switched from one end to the other.It is so frustrating I would just prefer not using it! I'm sorry I bought the Epilady Duet."
2,not impressive.,"I was pretty disappointed with this product. If you have thick hair, this isn't for you! It works great with facial hair though. All women with healthy heavy hair growth..this product is not for you."
2,If You Have A Lot of Extra Time...,"... to do nothing but run this thing across your legs over and over again, then go ahead and buy this. You will be up all night, trying desperately to get all the hairs! And yes, I followed the directions to the letter!My body hair is fine and medium in darkness.I'm a grooming pioneer: I used the original Epilady when it first came out. I loved it. When it died from old age, I replaced it with this thing. The ""epilating"" portion is microscopic, and easily skips over other hairs with ease. The shaving portion of the Duet is great; it's a nice, little shaver.I'll be looking for an ancient Epilady model on auction sites, because I frankly don't have the time to keep going after the hairs the Epilady Duet missed."
3,Meliart recipes,I have lost my copy of this book. I first read it 35years ago. it gave amazing simple recipes for meals for all types of ailments
5,"""We don't have to suffer, the resources are out there""","I cannot say enough good about this movie...it made me want to get up and act...and it states what I've always believed, there are enough resources out there, they are just mismanaged.But rather than a negative gloom and doom, this film presents many different individuals creating sustainable water treatment, energy, land use, etc. etc. etc....and so many positive, wonderful solutions to the problems we face.And of course the true change, isn't 'trickling down"" it's all growing up, grass roots. I wish I could send a copy of this to everyone I've ever met, have it shown in every school, every church, etc. etc. etc."
1,Junk!,"This was a total waste of my time! Very strange how the narrator went to Africa, had a very weird ""trip"" on something! The ""king"" or whoever said his grandmother was protecting him from seeing to much!OK??????? God help us, if this is all we have to look forward to!"
2,NOT grammatically correct!!,"I got this shower curtain as kind of a joke. All my friends and family joke that I am obsessed with proper grammar. I've had it for several months and I really don't pay that much attention to it, but in the shower today I realized that there were mistakes on it!! There is one spelling error and an actual GRAMMATICAL error!! On any other product I would just ignore it, but you would think that on a product that promotes itself through grammar, it would actually be correct. I was pretty mad, considering the product is supposed to teach one the correct rules of grammar!"
3,"Grain of salt, people","I'm a big English grammar nerd, so I of course had to have this shower curtain. The fact that this is a shower curtain (a SHOWER CURTAIN, people!) with English grammar rules on it is pretty awesome in and of itself--but the fact that there are multiple spelling and grammar errors on it, combined with the fact that most of the examples are extremely awkward, makes it truly precious."
4,Very Good,"This tape has some good songs for the christian wedding ceremony.Specially the song ""Join our hearts""."
1,Confusing,"I have no background on massage or reflexology, so I bought this book thinking I can do home study without going to technical school. Just to learned proper techniques and thumb placement for basic to moderate massaging or reflexology. No! This book has a very nice colorful pictures but the way it explain movements or techniques are a little confusing to me...maybe if you have a little knowledge about the subject, you can follow and understand what the author is trying to show or explain. I don't think this book is for beginner. My only suggestion is to actually follow the techniques by watching it on YouTube. I did and I learned and understand it faster than reading this book."
5,Super!,Great book! Covers the basics of reflexology and then some. Shows specific techniques for certain ailments which is fabulous! Also has a great detailed map of the feet and hand reflex points. Highly recommend this book for those wanting to learn and those already learned in reflexology.
5,Own 3 of them,It's a very nice no frills monitor or tv mount. I use them for computer monitors on walls where movement isn't necesary.
5,Fun for all,"I bought the turtles for my nephew. He has just turned two years old. The size and shape are just right for him to play with. He has figured out that the shape on top of the turtle will match the cut out on the shell. Great learning toy for shapes, colors and fun in bath time too."
5,Love this toy but NOT for tub!!!,"My 2-year-old son played with this toy at a ""mommy and me"" class and absolutely loved it. I did not realize it was technically a water toy. When I went to buy it, I noticed reviews that water stayed in the turtles and mold would build up easily. I bought the toy knowing this and resolving that this was not to be a tub toy. As an early childhood educator, I love the components of learning and matching shapes and learning colors. My son quickly learned shape names and matches them up to the coordinating turtle. We have taken it one step further by matching the colored shell to a colored plastic toy plate. My son LOVES this toy and wakes up asking for his turtles. When he is done playing with them, this toy will stay with me in my career for years!"
2,Great looks BUT critical flaw,"I was really excited about this coffee maker in large part because of its design with the removable water tank. All around the coffee maker looks sharp.However, I was disappointed rather quickly as the machine makes very weak coffee. I read through some other reviews on this site and others and apparently it's not a unique problem with my machine. Even after using the ""Flavor+"" button, I had weak coffee despite using two heaping tablespoons per six ounces of water. For some of you, maybe using the ""Flavor+"" button with large amounts of ground will be fine, but that's your risk to take. Without using the ""Flavor+"" button you might as well be drinking water!!!"
4,Michael Graves Coffee Pot Problem,"I like this pot a lot, but the heating tray is horrible. I am so disappointed. It is awful looking and rusty. The rust also adheres tothe bottom of the glass pot and is hard to clean off. I'd sure like to know if it could be replaced with a new warming tray or is theresome type of teflon-like spray that could be used/sprayed onto it."
4,best pouring carafe,This Michael Graves Design coffee maker by Hamilton Beach is a wonderful replacement for the leaky uneven heating dribble pouring one. I like the removable water resevoir for easy cleaning. It has an added flavor enhancement feature which holds the heated water a little longer in the grounds for a more customize strength. The carafe although a little heavy when filled with coffee pours excellently. Others rated this particular coffe maker as a good value or a best buy and I would agree.
1,poorest performing coffee maker I have ever bought!,"Within a week of purchasing this (and I had to wait a long time as it was on backorder,which appeared to be because it was so popular and got such good ratings)...the hot plate coating chipped badly and eventually was non-existent;the pause and pour feature dripped continuously,brewing was unbelievably slow and when the machine was shut off, steam that had formed continued to leak thru to the heating plate. This was not a $9.95 item and I am very unhappy with it..."
3,lasted about a year.,We bought this coffee maker at Target and it lasted about a year. Very good coffee and loved the design. I went to make coffee and it quit working. What a surprise. I just want a coffee maker that last a long time. I cuisinart an option. I am afraid I will spend a lot and it will break after a year as well. Input?
2,Coffeemaker,I found the coffee maker would not fix under the kitchen cabinets....too tall so I returned the product.....
2,Hidden problems,"While this is fairly sturdy, and the carafe feels good and pours easily without drips, the coffeemaker has four problems: It uses basket (cupcake) filters instead of cone filters, which causes the coffee to be weak, especially when making less than a full pot, and also is likely to cause leaks/spills as the filter edge flops over, causing stray coffee grounds to block the drip/stop mechanism; it does not heat the water hot enough to make good coffee; it makes a lot of condensation under the lid, which flows (as water) into the carafe when you open the lid; and you cannot pour the last tablespoon or so of coffee (or water) out of the carafe, so you must dry it by hand.A shame. We were hoping for a good, simple coffeemaker, and this one seemed to come close. We could have lived with the last two problems, if only it heated the water hot enough and used cone filters. It's being returned."
1,Worked Great... till it BROKE,"After about 9 months of daily use, this coffee maker no longer functions properly, and spews steam like a witch's cauldron."
3,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING,"The leaking coffee basket was annoying at first -- it's the worst thing about this coffee maker -- but I learned to remove the basket first and let the water drip into the carafe. It makes good coffee, but I wish coffee makers still installed a beeping feature when the brewing was finished. The best feature is the removable water tank."
2,Pretty but beware that finicky filter basket!,"This looks elegant on my kitchen counter, and I really like the readable clock display. However, I would not recommend it because the filter basket must be seated EXACTLY RIGHT -- or you wind up with a nasty-overflowing-wet-coffee-grounds-disaster. In my experience with every other coffee maker, you just drop in the filter basket and proceed. With this model, the basket MUST be inserted to line up with a little notch, so that it drops into position. If you just drop it in, the drip process backs up and overflows the filter. Big mess! This is a design flaw you wouldn't find on a $15 model from the drug store."
5,"Best Design, Easiest to keep clean, Easy fill",I'd buy it again. I had none of the issues described in some of the negative reviews with dripping. We are coffee hounds and have been through dozens of coffee makers and this is the absolute best by far. You can spend more (we tried) but you will not beat this design.
3,Just So So,"In short, after having this for about a year, I can't say it's terrible and I can't say I love it. Looks nice! I actually bought it because our Braun decided to leak during pause mode after about 5 years. I tried to fix it cuz otherwise I loved the Braun which they evidently don't make anymore. Anyway, this thing leaked during pause mode from the get go unless you take the pot away ""just right"". Kinda like winning the lottery. It also leaks while brewing just a bit though I'll be darned if I can figure out where. My main complaint and what has gotten worse over time is how hot the coffee is. I haven't taken a thermometer to the water, but upon having a cup of coffee today from Starbucks, I had an HaHa moment. Looking for a new coffee maker right now!"
2,Lasted 8 months,I purchased this coffee maker last July and it's now not working.Used Daily. Worked well initially. Anyone else have issues with short product life?
1,I bought it and returned it,"This coffee maker might look nice, but it makes a lousy cup of coffee. The regular cycle runs so fast that you get weak flavored brown liquid, and the flavor cycle produces a bitter cup of joe. I am going back to my DeLonghi 12 cup, which, although not rated that high on this site, gave me a delicious cup of coffee every morning. I really do not recommend this machine and I very much doubt that Michael Graves (whoever he is) makes his morning coffee using this inferior machine."
1,The BIG BLUE EYE,"I really, really do not like this coffeemaker. We have it put away for our next yard sale. With all the digital clock devices spewing unwanted light at night around the house, the BIG BLUE EYE was just too much. The other thing I did not like was the small, plastic-rimmed opening of the carafe; I cut my wrists several times when trying the wash the interior. Coffeemaking and cleanup should not be this hard for the price offered. I gave it one star just because it did make a liquid that resembled coffee."
1,"Worthless, have to replace","We purchased this coffeemaker on the recommendation of a well-known consumer advocacy publication. We purchased it just over a year ago, just long enough for the warranty to expire. It takes two hours to make eight cups of coffee. If you try to make a full pot, the two-hour safety shutoff will kick in, and you will be left with water still in the tank. I like the blue display, the simplicity of setting the timer, but the quality is lacking."
1,Carafe not dishwasher safe,"The reason we chose this model is because of the removable water reservoir.That is convenient. I'd like to point out to consumers before they buy this coffeemaker that on page 9 of the manual in bold letters it says ""Do not place carafe in dishwasher"". If it had indicated on the box that the carafe was not dishwasher safe, I would never have purchased it. Also note, on page 6 of the manual under 'Important Notes' the top one is: Automatic Brew must be programmed each time it is used. Annoying! The blue light is super bright - I'd like to know how much energy it uses. It does call for one scoop of coffee for each cup, that's 12 scoops for a full pot? We will be returning this tomorrow. After using it once. Too many cons for this consumer!"
4,Leakage of the carafe where bottom of handle meets the glass,"I love the coffee maker, however, recently I've noticed a lot of hissing noise and when I investigated the cause I discovered that the coffee is leaking out of the carafe at the bottom part of the handle where it's joined to the glass part. I hesitate to buy a replacement carafe if this is an inherent problem with it. Has anyone else experienced a similar problem?"
2,"PRETTY, YES, BUT.......","Wow...disappointing!! This is really pretty music. And yes, the lyrics are simple in the best sense, and touching. But....with the exception of a couple of stand-out tracks, this is BORRR-ING. It meanders all over the place at a very slow and stretched out pace, and although the singer has a soothing voice, you'd be much better off getting an Astrud Gilberto CD, seeing as how she sounds just like her. If you like background music or soothing music for coffee shops, you might want to check this out..."
1,I agree - the tape doesn't follow the book,"I agree with the previous reviewer that the tape is terrible. It infuriates me that a publisher can get away with distributing a tape that does such a terrible job following the book. If a publisher distributed a book with several chapters missing, people wouldn't stand for it. But the book/tape interface here is the equivalent - whole sections of aural instruction referred to in the book are missing from the tape. It's also worth noting fully half of the first side of 1 of 2 tapes is taken up with the basic introductions - the vocal equivalent of a title page."
3,"Good for beginners, though with quite a few careless mistake","Good for beginners, though with quite a few careless mistakes. Cassette tapes use the Northern Accents and not clearly recorded so they are pretty useless. The pronunciation section at the beginning (with some mistakes again) is not clearly written so you have to find a Vietnamese firend to help you on this. The context is written in Northern Vietnamese (with almost no reference or hints of Southern Vietnamese), this can be frustrating if you're in the South. Lessons (18 in total) are quite well designed, with some cultural notes. This book is so far the most popular learning material for foreigners, and even the HCMC Publishing House (Nh?xu&#7845;t b&#7843;n TPHCM) got a license to produce this book (blue cover with a big Ti&#7871;ng Vi&#7879;t, costs 28000 ?#7891;ng). You may also consider the Colloquial Vietnamese (published by Routiledge) and it seems to be better than than the TY one."
2,Needlessly hard and difficult to use,"I consider this book a major disappointment. Much of the material is well-presented, but too many words are used in the exercises (and in the dialogues of each lesson) that do not turn up in the glossary in the back. I find the book really heavy going even with a dictionary. Some of the grammatical explanations are good, but there are many idiomatic usages in the lessons and no real guidance of how to use them. Even after working through the book and tapes I don't feel at all confident in even simple conversation. Coverage of phonics is very skimply and the differences between different phonemes are not explained. The recorded dialogues on the tapes are spoken very fast and are extremely difficult to follow. I feel that the author could have used much more input from would-be users- a book that purports to be a ""teach yourself book"" should be much more self-contained. It should not be necessary so often for the user of it to have to consult outside references."
5,Great coffee maker,I have used this product for 2 months and have not had any problems with it.It is well made and does what it is meant to do.There are no filters for the coffee basket so you should use a coarsergrind with this type of percolator. The water heats up just below the boiling point and stays hot as long as you keep it plugged in. There isno automatic turnoff.
4,disappopinted,"The problem was we used the Urn for about 26 hours, only to boil water. After we disconnected and disposed of the remaining water, we saw a brownish discloroation inside the urn, up to the level my wife filled it. Maybe it's not harmful, but we were uncomfortable with this. For all we know maybe something peeled off. We have had other urns over the years of other brands, only for boiling water. We never saw it like this before.Your urn is beautiful design and boiled the water to a good hot temperature.you should check out why the urn did this in the inside."
4,Good stuff,I have been realy satisfied with this product. We run that maker 24/7 and it does the job great. It is a fine art figuring out how much coffee to put in the basket but once you figure it out themaker is well worth the small price.
2,Very Brief History,"This is a nice, concise history of Athens County.But, I think Athens County (Images of America) by Ron Luce is a better choice.The cover on this booklet does not have anything to do with the contents. Be assured there are no castles like this in Athens County."
4,Cute Lift-the-Flap book,"My two-year-old LOVES this book. When we got it, he made me read it 10 times in a row (I'm not exaggerating!) It's a cute lift-the-flap book. Grover is looking through a spooky house, and in each room he asks ""Is there a monster in the bathroom? In the bedroom?"" etc. In each room, the child lifts a flap to see a cute monster - one's in the shower with bubbles all over his head, one's fixing the sink in the kitchen, a baby monster is in the nursery riding a rocking horse. The ending is ""The house is full of monsters who want to play with you!"" So it's slightly ""spooky"" in a fun way, but totally NOT scary at all. Very cute."
4,Seven That Spells - 'My Mommy Wants To Kiss Your Mommy' (R.A.I.G.),"Croatian psych band's very first CD. Disc has a single fifty-four minute track - however after looking at an online info blog of this release, it appears it comes out to seven actual songs. A couple of the separate tunes I could come up with that I liked best were the twelve-minute out-there title cut ""My Mommy Wants To Kiss Your Mommy"", ""Inhale Me"" and ""Black Liquorice"". Another modern day psychedelic gem that usually gets over-looked. With this CD from Seven That Spells, their influences are clearly Acid Mothers Temple, Hendrix and early Pink Floyd. Essential."
3,Biography written mainly for children or adolescents,"This Bio of one of the greatest sportsmen ever to step onto a hardwood floor is well written, but clearly aims at children for a reading audience. Too much time goes into explaining obvious historical knowledge like the fact that back in the fifties races were seperate.I anticipated a biography written by somebody else than Bill himself (who wrote three autobiographies), but this book doesn't live up to my expectations"
5,Albert terhune collie story,"Once again author has memorized us with the power of a collie. They can love unconditionally, have uncanny perceptions. And the smartest logic a four legged animal can have."
3,Second Album Finds DA Sinking Into 80's Syndrome,"After their stunning debut in '85, one would think that they'd follow it up with another atmospheric masterpiece.Yeah, that's what I thought, too.Instead, this album finds The Dream Academy doing some terrible Duran Duran impressions. Though there are some wonderful songs buried in here (Here, Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime, Ballad In 4/4) the album sinks like an anchor. A few of the songs make me sick to my stomach (Doubleminded, Power To Believe).However, though thought of as the band's worst album, their third and final release (now out of print) ""A Different Kind Of Weather"", is actually much better than this one. If you find it in a used CD shop, pick it up."
5,a cd not to live without,The Dream Academy's second album Rememberence Days is one of the most incredible recordings of our time. It is filled with images and feelings that are timeless.
4,Worth it for one track,"Indian Summer - a beautifully evocative track, perfectly written, arranged, and produced to help you smell, feel, see, touch, and taste the Indian Summer."
2,A decent...albeit real basic book,"As a beginners book it wasn't bad, but I was expecting something new or more advanced that I've read in better books previously.AdvancedMacking.Com and How to be the jerk that women loveare much better books than this one."
5,Classic,"I doubt I would actually try such outrageous tactics, but even so, I don't regret reading it for the humor. The writing is excellent and the author comes across as very intelligent and has a great, very dry sense of humor. It's honestly refreshing, but I wouldn't reccomend actually following its advice."
3,Hilarious,"The best comedy is rooted in truth. Nick Cassanova takes the basic ""confidant male"" strategy for picking up the ladies, and embellishes it to the nth degree, resulting in a laugh-out loud ""manual"" for scoring with the chicks. This is a very light read, but is quite enjoyable. The author plays it straight while offering uproarious methods to co-opt one's way into a stranger's (...)"
5,One of the best...,"After having read several books on the subject of womanizing (aka being a PUA), I have to say this is one of the best so far. Its both halarious and helpful. This book will make an excellent addition to anyone's collection of books about picking up and achieving sucess with women. Its not the only book you'll want to get on the subject, but its on the must have list in my opinion."
4,Young women should read this book too...,"I got this book from my ex girlfriend of all people. It's chock full of idiotic advice, but the blatantly sexist tone is great for a laugh. Best tip: Pretend to be a foreigner. Runner up: Always try to be seen catching a football or doing something ""active."" The book is actually quite funny and outrageous. And for anyone willing to be put aside any sort of moral qualms, it should have some good advice. Casanova makes it clear that the point of the book is The List, not moral rectitude. Deception and manipulation work wonders - on women and men. Young women should read this book as a heads-up to the ploys men might try to pull on them..."
5,best stuff for the deck,"this is the best stuff for any deck or railings. oil based, looks great, holds up for a long time"
4,A morally chilling novel of suspense.,"Vachss shows he has literary guts in this Burke novel,where our anti-hero is hunting down a cult that preys onchildren and trains them for murder. Burke will have toconfront his deepest demons, and question the morals ofhis vigilantism in this excellent novel."
5,Learning how to write.,I started this series with Flood and have worked my way up to Sacrifice. Vachss always was good at plot but the man is learning how to write. I cared about the people in this one. Im looking forward to the next one.
4,Voodoo enters the asphalt jungle,"Vachss delivers another slice of dark urban fiction, with Burke and his crew, as usual, poking their way down the darkest tunnels of human depravity. They've got their hands full, too, with a vicious and deadly child with multiple personalities, Satanists, and a baby-killer on the loose. As if that wasn't enough, Burke can only find his way forward on the case with the help of a Haitian voodoo cult ruled by a clairvoyant Queen, who knows more about Burke than he does himself. Stumbling around in places where even zombies won't go, Burke gathers his entire crew for an apocalyptic and blood-strewn assault of the Satanist headquarters. Violent, powerful and gripping."
3,More like a short story,"I was a bit disappointed at how short the story was. The girls went through some trials, some titilating and some repulsive. The ending was a bit of a let-down for me. If you can get it cheaply, give it a try, but I suggest you don't pay a lot for it."
3,Cute but...,"They are cute but even if you presoak in water they tend to explode spontaneously. If they dont explode, they deteriorate with regular watering."
4,Great,"I thought the Poirot Series 3 was fantastic, especially for the price. I never watched Poirot back when it was on television. I am fortunate to have the chance to get any of them on DVD. I was blown away when I received them in 4 days too!"
5,Agatha Christie's Poirot Series3,I love to read Agatha Christie's Books. The Poirot Series DVD are the Best way to veiw Her Stories. Plus I love this actor for her Poirot.
5,Marvelous series,"I have never read any of Agatha Christie's novels, but with this Poirot series I may have to start. The casting is superb--David Suchet puts all other Poirots to shame, combining sharp intellect with wry wit and charm. Watch this series!"
3,Good for what it is,"The quality was a little lower than I was expecting, but overall a good product. I have no major complaints, only I wish I high grade of material was used."
1,Believe the folks who tell you it falls apart,"The dish rack falls apart. Do not buy it. It is not durable. I just came to check my Amazon account to see when I purchased it, and it was only in February, 2012. It is now October, 2012 and in the 8 months since about 25% of the wooden slats are loose or have fallen off. I will admit that I use it every day, but it should be made for that, right? Bowls will not stand up in it, and the slats are held on by these tiny weak metal nails/tacks that don't do the job. It looks nice, but doesn't last. Buy something else!"
1,awful,This product looked rickety when it arrived. The initial assessment proved true when it quite literally lasted half a day.
3,This IS the IKEA dish rack,"I added this to my wish list and received it as a gift just the other day. It is perfect for my usage and just what I expected.I'm reviewing because I wanted to expand on what another reviewer noted, that this rack is available from IKEA. Actually, this IS the IKEA dishrack. The IKEA sticker was still on the side of it when I received it. I'm not sure how much it costs at IKEA, but if it really is only $5, this is a total rip off.If I had paid for this myself (and not received as a gift), I'd probably make a stink with the seller for unclear advertising..."
1,Poor Quality- Fell apart in a week,I ordered this product to replace one I had that I thought was similar but in less than a week it began falling apart. There were staples poking everywhere. I would not recommend that anyone buy this product.
3,Same as IKEA,"I bought a dish drainer just like this at IKEA in 2000, 11 years ago! It FINALLY needs replacing. Eleven years for $5? You can't beat that."
5,Great item!!!,"This collapsable dish drainer is exactly what I wanted. Thin, light, and yet strong enough to hold two pans, a bowl, and three glasses. We use this drainer for those items that either aren't allowed in the dishwasher or those times that you have a few left over that just won't fit! It seems a little delicate at times, but I use a little caution when opening and closing and for the money, you can't beat it!"
2,Cheaply Made,"I can see why this rack is so inexpensive. It's very cheaply made, with splinters of wood hanging off of it. The parts are connected with staples, too! Very shoddy workmanship. I really only wanted the utensil drainer, so I'm happy with that. My old rack is much better quality, so I'll keep it and toss this piece of garbage. It's not worth spending money to send it back."
1,Lost in the Mail...,Never got the product. I work out of state and the time i got home a month later the part wasn't their. and still haven't received the part in three months...
3,"Great Recipes, Terrible Editing","This is one of the best and one of the worst cookbooks I have ever used. On the plus side: great and easy-to-make recipes, detailed guidance on preparing foods in advance, and helpful, pretty illustrations. I use this book more than any other hors d'oeuvres cookbook that I have, and my party guests rave about the results. On the negative side: Very very careless editing -- the worst I've ever seen in a professionally published cookbook. Ingredient lists will include ingredients that are never mentioned in the texts of the recipes, but that are clearly required. At least one recipe begins with instructions to preheat the oven (and then the oven is never used). Worst of all: ingredient lists which contain plain errors (such as a cookie recipe which gives the amount of required butter in both grams and cups, but the amount of butter given in grams is one half the amount given in cups.) In using this book, proceed with caution."
3,"Nice reference, unreliable recipes","This is a very attractive cookbook. It is nicely arranged, and has a broad variety of recipes. However, the recipes seem to have been very poorly edited. The measures, given in both weight and volume, do not always agree (often differing by a factor of two or more), and the ingredient lists sometimes include ingredients that are never used in the recipe.The best feature of this cookbook is the make-ahead tips: each recipe has clear instructions on how far in advance it can be made, with storage and reheating instructions.Use this book to plan your party and for tips on how to make your hors d'oeuvres in advance. But use a more reliable reference for the recipes."
4,beautiful,I love this book as a proffesional caterer and home cook I often use it for its inspiration and charming presentation ideas.Simply lovely!
5,"Beautiful, useful, educational, creative","I made 3 recipes out of this book for a party the day I received it, all three for things I had never attempted to make previously - and all 3 were a huge success. I have successfuly used it several times since, and while many recipes can be time consuming if you don't plan ahead, there are a few fairly simple and quick ones. It is porbably not for you if you are only looking for simple appetizer ideas or if you don't want to purchase somewhat advanced pastry utensils (i.e. fluted cookie cutters and tartlet forms), but as other reviewers have said, it is an excellent inspiration for those of us who love to cook."
5,"The Best ""Do Ahead""","I go to this book time & time again. The biggest praise I have is the preparation. Having your snacks done in advance is a big plus. This has the most realistic recipes for a ""chef & hostess"" in one. It really is worth having. My favorites are the ""Ginger Chicken Cakes"", ""Fennel marinated Feta"" & ""Filo Tartlets"". If you are looking at: Small Bites by Jen Joyce is good too, but it is based more on ""small bites"". It shows good do aheads too, but lots of the recipe's need silverware & plates/bowls to serve. Hors D'Oeuvres is better suited for picking up with your hand and popping in your mouth with only a bamboo skewer or cocktail napkin needed."
3,Johnny Unitas,"Although, the recording is not of the best quality, it was very good. With interview by Johnny Unitas, whom I consider the greatest quarterback in history. I do hope that they produce a really good documentary of him in the future. As usual, I recieved it in a timely manner, by Amazon."
1,Not so great,"Sent this back right away. The tongue and box clasp was very poorly made and seemed to be warped. Also It was a significantly less gram weight than stated in the ad (by over 2 oz. less.) I understand that weight said ""approximate"" but with the price of gold - over 2 oz. less is a SEVERE rip-off!!!"
5,Simplee clean microfiber pad,"I have 3 of these pads I use on my Swifter mop. They work a lot better than the paper type which cost a small fortune. When theses pads get dirty, simply throw them in the wash with your cloths or towels. The pad is a good quality product that will last a long long time."
2,Not as good as rubbermaid,I don't really care for these products compared to rubbermaid. The microfiber doesn't pick up as much as the rubbermaid brand and that is definitely a problem
4,Good discs,"I strongly agree that Memorex does not have high standards (the new 8x DVD-DL are remarkably bad), however these DVD-R's have worked just fine for me."
5,Good product,"Memorex DVD-Rs are, I have found, the best overall value for the money. I have a reasonably recent Sony DVD+/-RW recorder with BluRay capability and found that some of the non-mainstream brands would fail during burning. The Memorex DVD-Rs are consistently good quality, and I have had only one fail out of three 50-Pack spindles.Highly recommended!"
1,Bad product or bad lot ???,"I never feel like I need to put the review. I may got a bad lot of this product. I tried a few disc to back up my data by Nero program and Philip drive, dell computer E1405. It failed more than half. At first I think that my drive is bad or my computer have something wrong, so I formatted and reinstalled all programs and then tried it again. It failed again. I think about buying a new dvd writer. I never think that the disc is bad, but when I write my data on Verbatim after I failed with Memorex. Verbatim worked great!!! It saved my money before I buy a new dvd writer. I cannot explain what happenned. If Memorex staff read this, please let me know. 1 star for wasting my time and I don't know what to do with 45 memorex disc ???"
2,Quality control is an issue,I would say that about 10 out of 100 DVDs failed during finalization rendering them useless. That's too high to accept. I have about 20 left and will not be buying Memorex again. Their strength in the past was tape. Discs are not their best products.
5,Best price for 50-pack I've found,"If you only need a 50-pack (as opposed to 100) of quality blank DVD-R's, then this is the pack for you. It arrived quickly, in great condition, great price and so far has recorded flawlessly. I also like the improved touch of the spindle cover screwing on instead of twist locking like previous spindles I've purchased (which can unexpectedly not catch properly and drop if you aren't careful)."
2,Have some problems with the CDs,"The first CD in this pack was damaged even before writing :(. Well, I was able to write the second one without issues. Hope the rest of them would be fine too."
2,Haphazard results when archiving movies,"I've owned the RCA DRC 8030 DVD recorder since June, and I'd have to say that roughly one third of all DVDs burned showed pixelation artifacts on playback. Sometimes the pixelation was minor, sometimes there would be large green horizontal streaks on the frame and actual simultaneous audio buzzing, but regardless, what I ended up with was a coaster in one-third of my recording attempts. The movie played right off the DVD recorder hard disk is perfectly clear, so that is not the problem. The problem seemed to be independent of film/program length or recording speed. Switching to DVD+R's has eliminated the problem completely, so I can only assume that the DVD-R was the source. I would therefore not recommend this product for archiving movies, at least for my particular brand of DVD recorder."
3,cheap case,"The good news is that these dvds seem to work as good as any I've tried.The annoying part is that they do not come in a case or box, once you peel the plastic paper from around the side, the blank media has a top and bottom to protect them, but no sides. Of course this is a money saving package, but if you only use these dvds occasionally, the sides will be exposed to dust or dings.I would prefer them to be protected in a box or a case. I will probably buy a different brand the next time I buy dvds."
1,Complete garbage,"I just had to toss a spindle of 50 of these coasters. Tried probably about 10 of them on three different burners/computers, and they all failed. I switched back to Verbatim DVD-Rs, and everything worked fine on all three machines. For my two cents, avoid Memorex like the plague."
5,Very happy,My item shipped very quickly and I received it in just a few days. Im very pleased with the seller!!
1,DVDs won't record,These DVDs do not record on my computer and I spent time trying to figure out why and there's no logical explanation. I tried other DVDs on my computer and they worked fine. Not sure if these were damaged or what. I only got about 2 DVDs to record out of 20 attempted.
1,DONT BUY MEMOREX!!!!!!!,"These things are CHEAP! And I don't mean that in the sense that they're a bargain, they're a ripoff. I tried to save some money and get these instead of a better brand. Failed burn, after failed burn, after failed burn. I ONLY BOUGHT A 10 PACK AND I'VE GOT 4 COASTERS!! If you want quality blank media, get Sonys. And If you really want superior quality then invest in some Taiyo Yuden brand media. They Are the best buy far. I've burned literally hundreds of disks on them and NEVER had a failed burn."
4,Not Perfect but very affordable for my needs.,"I have been using Memorex dvd-r blank media for more than a year and have gotten fine recordings with my new dvd player/recorder. Not all of my recordings were successful, no product I know is 100% perfect, but the majority have been successful with Memorex dvd blank media.This 50-pack spindle was purchased from Amazon because I know I can rely on them to give you the best in quality and value plus free shipping. Moreover, I have never really been disappointed with anything purchased from Amazon.After trying many dvd-r blank media, I found Memorex dvd-r spindles to be affordable and reliable for a better than average performance."
2,Nothing but coasters in 4 different burners!,"I've got four 16X PC burners with the most up to date firmware. Out of 20 attempts, I have 20 coasters. I don't have this problem with any other brand of 16X speed discs. Like the Memorex 8X discs, the 16X discs work well in my home theater DVD Burners but only in SP mode and at 1X record speed. In EP or 2X-16X record mode, the discs pixelate on playback."
1,Majority Are Failures,"I do not review items like this unless they are worthless junk. Well, i'm reviewing these for that reason. These are the worst dvds i've ever had, by far. These damn things keeps getting stuck writing the ""lead in"" no matter which software or hardware i use. I am not even half way down the spindle, and they're going fast considering the failure rate, and i've said to hell with it. I think i'll give them to a buddy i want to play a joke on. Seriously."
5,Pilates mix indeed!,"This is a great DVD. It has loads of new moves from the first MTV Pilates DVD.It has 2 30-minute workouts, divided in parts: arms, legs abs sections, and seems that workout 2 is more challenging than workout 1. Based on that, you can pick 3 workouts from arms 1, 2; legs 1, 2; and abs 1, 2. (e.g you can pick arms 1, legs 2 and abs 1, or arms 1, 2, abs 2. Any combination of 3 workouts!) and it'll play the ones you pick as a 30 minute workout.It also includes a bonus total body 10 minute workout which is very challenging, it is mostly legs and some abs.All in all a great workout DVD. Kristin McGee is a great instructor and the background people show different positions for all fitness levels. The location is a Manhattan club turned into a studio with black background and colorful sets. And has good upbeat music.Definitely a workout worth checking out!"
4,Not traditional pilates...,"This is very much a fusion-type workout! I agree that for me, the pacing was quick and some of the moves I wasn't quite ready for. To safely do this workout, I recommend you at least be at an intermediate level (and not have any wrist problems!) I had a bad fall a few months ago and can't do much plank work, so I'll have to put this DVD away for another time. But, I liked the instructor! Kristin was very upbeat and motivating, and I would probably purchase other workouts led by her. If you're looking for detailed instruction though, you won't find it here!"
2,Not very user friendly,"I bought this DVD (as I have many others) based on the fact that it is supposed to be ""customizable."" First, the DVD did not specify the amount of time each section was allowed. Second, the feature that allowed the user to customize did not work with my DVD. I had to do ""arms"" first, and then the rest of the workout in the order presented. I was not allowed to switch the workout around. Third, I could only pick 3 of the 6 workouts in my ""customized"" session. Not happy at all with that as I would have liked to add more. This DVD was not user friendly and the information needed to time the workout is not there for the user."
2,"Very Difficult, Lack of Instruction","I was disappointed in this DVD. I have done a decent amount of yoga and pilates; however, I couldn't believe how difficult this was. The first workout was practically impossible for me, as it required SO much upper body strength. It put a ton of strain on my wrists. Kristin McGee is lifeless, and she never explained what parts of the body each exercise was suppossed to be targeting as most instructors do.Kristin tells you if you're a beginner to watch so-and-so for modifications, however, the way the DVD is edited makes this impossible as the ""beginner"" person isn't always in view.This DVD left me annoyed and discouraged.If you are looking for a total body, low-impact workout, I highly reccommend Carmen Electra's ""Fit to Strip."" Unlike Kristin McGee, Carmen is very fun and down to earth. She makes you feel like you're working out with your best friend.I also reccommend Winsor Pilates, Tae Bo, and The Firm dvds instead of this one."
2,Way too advanced for beginners,"I purchased this product because I was trying to get more out of my workouts and I wanted to try pilates. Though the instructor says to follow one of the other trainers if you're a beginner, they don't focus in enough on that person so it's hard to follow. This is for more advanced pilates users."
2,Not good for your back!,I'm 49 and have been doing a variety of pilates videos for a few years without trouble and found this one to be too difficult. I hurt my back trying to do this one and will not attempt it again. Do not get this if you are a beginner bacause you need a lot of strength. You have to be super limber to do the moves. I think thin women or those under age 20 might be able to do it. It's risky. Wouldn't recommend it.
3,eh,"i must admit, i was extremely excited to see that mtv put out pilates and yoga fitness tapes. i figured, ""hey, maybe there will be some decent music involved and i wont get bored out of my mind.""well this was not the case.it involves typical workout music, despite the fact that it says ""DJ rockin the music.""no. there isnt any adrenaline pumping music.so if youre looking for a fun workout,this is not it."
1,false advertizing,"Purchased this item based on description on amazon page.It said it had the temperature sensor,which it did not.Called to get the right one with temperature sensor I was sent the same one again.Finally I gave up and said I would send both in for credit,they said fine.I then had to call up to get a credit on my discover card,they originally sent me a email saying my credit was denied.I was told I should of sent both items back in seperate packages,but originally I was told to send original item back with replacement item.I am still waiting for credit.In the mean time through my own research I ordered item xnt 9 20 t-that has the temp sensor.Customer service was no help."
2,No temp sensor on this transducer,"My old transom mount was torn off, I shopped online, found this one at a reasonable price, but there is no temp sensor as advertised. My old one had one. Don't buy this one if you want a temp sensor"
2,Replacement transducer,"This transducer performs well for fishfinding but was advertised as having a temperature sensor. It doesn't work! It would cost too much to uninstall and return so I just kept it. My trolling motor does have a temp sensor when hooked to the same finder. Temperature is most important to me when bass fishing so I am not too worried, disappointed but not worried."
1,make sure trqansducer will work on your model,"I purchased this item after checking humminbirds website and it said it would work with model 560. What they didn't say was that it will only work utilizing a single beam. Check with humminbird to make sure it is compatable,"
5,Great transaction!,Item was just as described and shipped quickly! Cute story I bought for some Kenyan missionaries! They had heard a retelling of this story and were very touched by it.
2,Not sure how it can work,"Touts itself to be an antioxidant sunscreen, but the only 2 ""active"" ingredients listed are the usual sunscreen things. How it's supposed to be antioxidant is beyond me. Would not buy again."
3,not really dvd quality,I like Connie Sellecca a lot. So I've bought this one and I would buy it again. The movie was a pleasent surprise. It's quite fun even though the plot is somewhat familiar. Ten little models and then there were nine. However picture quality of this DVD is about the worst I've seen. It looks like a 4th generation VHS copy and I'm not exagerating.
4,courthouses of texas: a guide,an excellant book on so esoteric a subject. I found the majority of the information provided to be very useful. this book has assissted me on my travels to see these great buildings.
5,The Courthouses of Texas,A must for those interested in the history of Texas county courthouses. Very helpful in planning visits to admire these buildings.
2,"Mildly entertaining - but only if you've lived in Macon, GA","I read somewhere that this is Ad Hudler's love letter to Macon, Ga - where he lived for a few years and the setting of this book. Well, if this is his love letter, I sure wouldn't want to get any hate mail from him. I lived there too and he gets the racism and materialism of the upper class pretty well. He also gets the xenophobia down pretty well, except he seems to think Yankees are only from New Jersey (I thought they were from Vermont because here in Boston we think New Jersey is the deep south!). I kept reading because I could recognize the places and some of the people. If I hadn't been able to do that, I doubt I would have read it all the way through."
1,Insulting,"I found his portrayal of Southerners to be incredibly insulting. In fact, I found the entire book poorly written and not at all in the league of Fannie Flagg which the cover brags."
1,Disappointing quality,"This bracelet looks beautiful, but after I received it I was very disappointed in the quality. The beads are of good quality and very pretty, but the silver connection rings look like pieces of cheap twisted wire that do not fit into the clasp. The beads were so tightly strung that the the bracelet would not straighten out flat. I returned the bracelet for a refund."
4,most refreshing,"I honestly bought the disc having never heard of Lincoln - I was thinking 'with a name like that, it's got to be great' - a most fortunate decision on my part. Lincoln is not the cookie-cutter music found in CCM nowadays - the arrangements, guitar leads, sincere lyrics and clean production are most welcome. I hope the industry sees Lincoln's music as raising the bar for other talent. I look forward to more music from Lincoln. What a blessing ...."
5,"Rob Mathes Is a Brilliant Composer, Arranger, and Musician","I have been at every single one of Rob Mathes' Christmas Concerts, including the one on this CD, and have loved everyone of them. His incredible original compositions and arrangements are further augmented by his amazing piano and guitar playing and his singing. In addition to this you've got people like Vanessa Williams, David Sanborn, and Michael McDonald adding their talent to this great live album. I now sing in Rob Mathes' choir, which is an amazing experience, and I can tell you Rob is the best conductor I've ever had. Hopefully soon some more of Rob's albums will get full release, like his first non-christmas CD, ""Evening Train,"" which is also a great piece of work. If you like this album, also take a look at Vanessa Williams's ""Star Bright,"" which has three of Mathes's songs on it."
2,Written Like Fiction,"A big problem I had with this book is the writer describes circumstances in a depth he could not have known, example: Michael's heart skipping a beat when Lisa Marie calls, or his inner thoughts and feelings, which has to be inaccurate at some points considering no one was there to monitor his pulse or brain so I thought that was silly. I don't expect anyone to know this and no-one does, so just stick to the facts Randy no need to embellish! This is the kinda subject that sells itself. On top of it this book was pretty long winded and boring, the truth is I never bothered to finish it, not out of disgust, but just out of boredom. I'm also skeptical of the accuracy because J Randy Taraborelli has written about a number of other celebrities including Frank Sinatra, Madonna, Liz Taylor, Grace Kelly and Diana Ross so maybe it's a hobby or a job for him to make celebrity semi fiction novels. I'm surprised some fans recommend this book."
5,Wonderfull stories of MJ,"I love this book. It is very informativ and objective. There are lots and lots of little MJ stories/anecdotes which shows MJ, the person. I can't recommend it enough. READ IT, laugh, cry and feel MJ. Excellent."
5,THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH!,"I've read several books about all things Jackson, this book being the first. I must say, a part from ""Jackson Family Values"" (a bit candy coated but a definate must read) and ""Be Careful Who You Love"" (A DEFINATE GOTTA READ!),this book answers every damn Michael Jackson question you will ever have. And the great thing about this book is that it was written long before his troubles began. It is almost a predictor of what was to come."
3,Details not always correct,"I noted some uncorrect important details: He describe Michael Jackson's children like this: Prince Michael I , black hair and Prince Michael II with blond hair in different occasions...where did he really was in the last 12 years of Michael Jackson's life...surely not enough close...as I saw..."
5,A True Insight Into The REAL World of Michael Jackson,"Mr Taraborrelli is a most gifted biographer, as is shown in this book. This book tells the true story of Michael Jacksons life, it is sympathetic to Michaels problems without hiding anything. I think that this is one of the only books that tells Michaels story in an un-biased way. This book is a must fr M.J fans and sceptics alike. At last the truth is told ! in a constructive a detailed manor."
4,accurate,"When I decided to purchase this book i did so because I have seen the author on numerous television shows talking about michael and thought that he would give a fairly accurate account of michael's life, and it turns out that I was right. instead of portraying michael as a weird child molester he portrays him as a caring, somewhat eccentric musical genius. I know that michael has his faults but who does'nt? he chronicles everything from the victory tour to michael's marriage with lisa marie to the hyperbaric chamber. while reading this book there will be times when all can do is shake your head at the things that michael suggests, and there will be times when you truly feel sorry for him, and then there will be times when all you can do is laugh. I know for a fact that one thing is for sure, after reading this book you will definitely view the king of pop in a new light, and maybe even understand why he behaves the way he does."
4,"Michael, Motown, and more!","This book is not only about Michael Jackson, but also about Motown Records, Berry Gordy, and the dynamics of America's #1 dysfunctional family, The Jacksons. Plenty of psychological profiles by a licensed therapist, which help to explain Michael's seemingly unexplainable motivations. Much more than a mere Michael Jackson bio, it also covers the rise to fame, and world surrounding Michael and his family. Taraborelli really did his homework, and you can tell that he really loves ""The Motown Sound"" regardless of the good and bad sides of the stories that unfold in this book. It's terrific reading whether you are a Jacksons/Motown fan or not. - Paula Martin -"
4,The only book about Michael Jackson which is truely balance,"There are many books out there about Michael that pretend to give an unbias account of his life. But in J. Randy Taraborrelli you have an author who truely believes in giving readers a balance account of the Michael Jackson story. He delves inside the life of the Jackson family in general, starting with the relationship between Katherine and Joe Jackson, giving us a greater understanding of his life. Also unlike other books that imply his ""true loves are little boys"" it looks at his relationship with people like Diana Ross-who I believe is the true love of his life-and Tatum O'Neal. The updated version of this book also goes into detail about his relationship with Lisa Marie Presley, which will surprise many.If you ever want to read an unbias account of MIchael Jackson's life, warts and all this is the book to get."
1,Tabloids Suck!,"I'm going to use a quote from Michael Jackson and tell me if I am correct about this book. ""Just because you read it in a magazine or see it on the television screen don't make it factual."" Now look this book is filled with lies don't read it, for a Michael Jackson fan it will only upset you. Frankly I haven't read it but I've only seen reviews that support this kind of nonsense! DON'T READ UNAUTHORIZED BOOKS GUYS! It means it doesn't come from Michael's mouth so why should you believe it? I love you Michael Jackson! You rock!"
5,Best MJ Biography Ever,This is a very in depth look into the life of Michael Jackson. The author had many one on one interviews with Michael as well as numerous people around the star. When I read this book it really gave me insight into the real Michael Jackson underneath all the rumors that are portrayed in the media. J. Randy Taraborrelli seems to be the person who knew Michael Jackson the best. I very much recommend this book and can't say enough good things about it. Once you start reading it you will be hooked and want to finish the whole book and that's saying a lot given how thick it is.
2,Powerpoint is disappointing,"I love the printed products from Rose. The content and design are exceptional. The design and illustration of the Powerpoint slides, however, are amateurish by comparison. Why won't Rose take the initiative to redesign the slides using the design and illustration evident in their published materials? Save your money."
3,'christianized' version,"Please understand before you buy this that it is a 'christianized' version and therefore has that bias to it. Aside from a few obvious errors, this is put together well and worth a few dollars.For a complete understanding of the Tabernacle, your best bet is always to go straight to the source and read the Torah, Talmud, and other writings by the Sages."
5,The Tabernacle Rose Publishing,"I had to borrow this book from the library to use it with the slides I already had, so i was tickled to be able to find it for such a good price."
3,"Quadrabeam is ok, not great.","Transducer does not work extremely well in my TR 186. The ""left"" side sonar does not transmit well but the bottom and right do. I was extremely careful to make sure it was getting mounted in the right spot, following the directions on the package and also speaking with someone at Triton Boats. Overall, the transducer works well but I wish that the ""left"" sonar would work better."
3,"Not quite what I expected, but will do the job.","I thought I was getting a rubber coated meter, but it is only a rubber sleeve that isn't even on very tight. I suppose it will do the job, though, just not what I thought I was getting. So far it works fine."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Bought this DMM at RS. Dead on arrival. I pulled the battery and it tested fine on my other meter. Put it back together and started twisting the knob around. Presto, suddenly started to work. OK, decided to do a simple continuity test. It takes almost a second for a tone. Rubbing the leads together produces a scratchy tone. Even my $20 DMM gives a solid tone when rubbing the leads together. The voltage reading worked fine but when I tried switching over to ma the meter went dead. Switched back to voltage, the meter comes back on. Switched back to ma then it worked for a minute then died again. That was it for this POS. Due to the poor quality and toy-ish look and feel, it didn't last 10 minutes on my bench before I was packaging it back up for return. I'll keep using my cheap $20 unit and save my money for a Fluke."
3,AutoPowerOff,Auto Power Off is a very annoying feature. The DMM would power off each 15 minutes and the only way to restart it is to turn the rotary switch off and back on (would be easier to do it by pressing a button.
4,Great so far,"This meter does all I want and need, and does it well. I can't check the absolute accuracy of such things as volts, ohms, etc, for lack of standards, but all seems good based on previous measurements with other instruments. All the functions work, it easy to use, seems well made."
1,Monosodium glutamate disaster,"Whenever I eat foods with MSG in them, I get mild to severe heart palpitations. I forgot to check the ingredients of Planters Dry Roasted Sunflower Kernels and I suffered the consequences. I am angry with myself (for not checking) and I am angry with Planters (A Kraft Foods division).MSG is only added as a flavor enhancer, it has no known health benefits. It is a chemoinducer of obesity, it affects neurons in a bad way, it decreases learning ability in children and lots more. In short, MSG is more a slow poison than it is a food.Planters has made, in effect, a healthy food into a very unhealthy product.Sorry Planters, I will never buy this product again unless you take out the MSG, the corn syrup solids, and other unnecessary ingredients."
1,not just kernels,"I purchased these for a snack for work. I love slated sunflower kernels and with the label saying simply ""dry roasted sunflower kernels"" I thought that was what I was going to get. I was wrong!They tasted off. I even scraped off the sticker to see if they had expired because the flavor was wrong. Nope, not expired.I went and looked at the label and discovered the problem. They are not just sunflower kernels they have other flavorings in them like paprika, onion/garlic powder, spices and other natural flavors (amongst a long list of other ingredients). This would be fine if they were labeled as ""lightly seasoned"" or anything that would indicate they were not plain kernels.I did not like them at all and will not buy them again. I also will not trust planters to be what the label indicates again as well.Read your ingredients."
2,"Dirty surprise! Contains sugar, gelatin, MSG","I asked my son in law to pick up a jar of planters dry roasted sunflower kernels. I was happily munching that first handful and reading the ingredients, a little too late. Contains sugar, gelatin, MSG, and some other less toxic ingredients. I was really so very disappointed. Onward to find better healthier more suitable sunflower kernels."
3,nice try,"this cd is an attempt to mix alternative arena rock with drum and bass.the music is basically janes addiction u2 rage against the machine and the beastie boys to a basic drum and bass beat. a little bit of dub and dance hall is thrown in for good measure.the vocals are an obvious mix of rage against the machine, beastie boys and red rat.not bad. certainly better than the new beastie boys. but not a break through music-wisethey should be huge in the states. i don't know why most alternacrap stations aren't playing this to death."
3,A really good drum-n-bass album,"Asian Dub Foundation's lastest release ""Rafi's Revenge"" is a very entertaining album that you will have no trouble listening to over and over again. You will have to; to drown out the vocals of Master D and enjoy the solid drum-n-bass laid down behind him."
2,Very dissapointing,"I was so dissapointed, I gave it to my brother. To me, the songs didn't vary enough. Most of them sounded SO similar. Like the Beastie's Ill-Communication, it's one of those albums that, if you listen to it straight thru, you get a headache. Unlike Ill-Communication though, It lacks standout tracks."
1,pretentious crap...look no further!,"If you want to waste your time and money , you have hit the motherlode with this aural torture. Do your self a favor and RUN , don't walk away from this sonic drivel."
4,do your ears a favor and listen to this cd,"rafi's revenge was far and away one of the better releases of '98 -- this band has fresh energy and its music is a sonic assault on complaceny-- so there you have it: deft programming + amazing musical taste and, o yes, an incredibly relentless groove. this band's for real."
3,A tribute to Native American legends. Not a rock album.,"For anyone who thinks this is something along the lines of Hymas' rock/fusion collaborations with Jeff Beck, forget it. This is a 2 CD tribute to Native American greats such as Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull, etc. Comes across like a epic soundtrack of incidental music, symphonic interludes, Native American chants, poetry, Native American instruments. Beck guests on two cuts, but doesn't make much of an impact.If you are fascinated by Native American culture, you may be intrigued. Listen to this while driving through Wyoming at night and it will give you chills. Otherwise, it is not for the average listener."
3,TO COFUSING,She spent to much time on the other characters rather the main characters. The party scene was way to long. I felt that Craig and Michelle and Nichole were the main story line. It took me a day to read because I wanted to know if Sissi and Percy ever got together. This one is now with the money.
2,CONFUSING,This was a very confusing book. She had one to many characters for me to understand what was going on. The party sceen was to long. She should have develop the main characters more. There was more relationship between Michelle and Craig than Sissi and Percy. It took me one to read this book because I wanted to know when the main characters were going to get together. The book was not boring just to confusing for me.This might have been better as a full lengh novel than a romance book.I gave it 2 star because it was a bad book.
1,Uughhhh!!!,"I would like to know what book anyone who rated this with more than two stars were thinking. Like the other readers, there was too much going on. I couldn't concentrate on the so called ""main characters"". This book is a joke. I couldn't fathom why Ms. Mayhew even bothered to write this if it's not readable. What editor would allow this? This is absolutely one of the worst. Save your money. If you got this book from the library like I did, go and get something else, but if you bought or are thinking about buying it, please save your money and your time. I got to the last chapter and could no longer be bothered, I had to stop reading and go online and write this scathing review. I may give her another chance, this book is quite old, maybe she got better. But don't bother with this one."
5,"Utada Hikaru & ""Ultra Blue""","Utada Hikaru is an amazing and unique artist with an incredible voice. I first was introduced to Hikaru's music when I played the original Kingdom Hearts back in 2002. As time went on, I came to listen to her other music and she has an amazing talent. ""Ultra Blue"" is one more spellbinding work from Hikaru, and I'm very excited to see much more from her. The album features all of her recent singles, including ""Passion"" with which Hikaru once agained graced the Kingdom Hearts universe in Kingdom Hearts II. Aside from her awesome singles Keep Tryin', Dareka No Negai Ga Kanau Koro, Colors, Be My Last, and Passion, some other great tracks include, but are not limited to, This Is Love, Blue, Nichiyou No Asa, One Night Magic (feat. Yamada Masashi). Also, the interlude Eclipse is a nice little transition into the awesomely powerful Passion, the perfect way to wrap up the album. Overall, the album is fantastic and so is Hikaru!"
5,Love Utada!,"""Making Love"" and ""Passion"" are definitely highlights for me. Have been a huge Utada fan since ""First Love""! Can't wait for the next album!"
3,Its Okay,Ultimately the content contained only a few articles that were really relevant to my search. The book does its job. I should have chosen something else.
5,You know more than you think you know and you are more than you think you are.. Interesting book,"As a young man of age 20, This book really helped me figure out quite a bit about life, my self, and other people. It opened my mind to what contribute to a persons behavior and that I should pay attention to more than just their from consciousness and see that perhaps some aspect of them was hurt and twisted but that they are unaware of it.I at first thought this book was telling me that people cannot help to be the way they are... and at first perhaps not, but after informing your self there can indeed be a way. This book can push you in the right direction.5/5"
5,Fifteen essays discuss how players interact with games,"Digital Gameplay isn't another game programmer's handbook, but a collection of scholarly, college- level essays on the topic of digital games with a survey of the role of the game. Fifteen essays discuss how players interact with games - essential information for programmers to know - and survey both physical and mental aspects of playing. While video games are also included, any game programmer will find discussions of how games are perceived and used by players to be important considerations in organizing and developing routines."
3,Strong religious overtones,"In the three years since my 24-year old brother committed suicide, I've bought and read several books about surviving the suicide of a loved one. Unfortunately, this one is not my favorite. I did relate to many parts of the authors' experience and feelings about the loss of their son. But I was turned off by the strong religious overtones of much of their writing. Although I do have a strong belief in God, I didn't personally find their numerous references to God and prayer helpful in dealing with my feelings. I found other books, such as Carla Fine's ""No Time To Say Goodbye"" more helpful in accepting and dealing with the feelings of guilt, shame and anger I've felt since my brother's death."
4,"Ready, get set, go","We are still picking our projects from here, so haven't built anything yet. However, there is so much to chose and the excitement continues to build. (No pun intended.) Really had my eyes opened to a multitude of fun projects to do with my kids. I recommend this book for those without lots of experience and for those with some background, because of the diversity you will find in here."
2,Fun Projects for You and the Kids: David Stiles,"The book is extremely vague. I thought the book would contain plans to construct forts, playhouses, etc. This is not the case. The book has drawings with a few overall dimensions, but lacks specifics. It does not contain plans, materials lists, etc. This is not a ""how to"" book."
5,Fun Projects for You and the Kids,"Great book if you want to pass your love of woodworking to your kids or if you just want to build cool stuff for them. Easy, simple and loads of fun."
5,excellent,I love this bra. I used to buy it at Kohl's but they no longer carry it. It gives great support without the underwire.
4,Awesome,"At first I hadn't been really happy when these people sent me dirt3 instead of driv3r, but now that i've got the actual game, it's awesome! A lot of the people that hate the game is because either A) (for some reason) they don't like the better graphics, gameplay, and more guns, B) It won't work with their computer's (You can just say your computer sucks) and C) some other stupid reason"
1,O M G,"How in Heavens Name is it possible to take a game title, like Driver, the Original was awesome, and turn it into a pileof dried up cow dung.We'll this Driver 3 ...I d rather play with dried up cow dung."
2,"Supposed to be better than GTA, but not","This game spent a lot of time in production delays and was hyped up to be better looking (which it was), with better gameplay and storyline than GTA. However, the only fun thing to do is try to hit pedestrians and bash into other cars. When it was reviewed by many game magazines, it was apparent that they too were underwhelmed with it and immediately wrote it off. Driver, Parallel Lines though, is much better. It was created after the take-over by Ubisoft. The graphics are much better and the gameplay and storyline are also very good. It is still trumped by the new GTA 4, but nonetheless a major improvement and shows promise that the next one (if it is produced) will deliver on its promises. The best thing about this game is you can buy it cheap and it doesn't make a modern gaming pc break a sweat."
2,Eh.,"I bought this game hoping it was something along the lines of the GTA series. It isn't really. It is very linear, which might be somewhat forgiveable, but its also very hard. In GTA, if you failed a difficult mission, you could just move on (unless you attracted a big police presence). Fail here, you start over from the beginning of the mission. I suspect the game might be a bit easier if the controls weren't so bad. I've tried modifing them to be more like GTA controls but it just can't quite be made to work."
2,just plain boring,"This game has got to be the most boring game I have ever played. It gets tough, and all you do is hide in the shadows and wait for the enemy to pass. The AI is very well done and very smart. The graphics and sound are very good as well. Thats why I gave it two stars. But the game play is just boring. This would be a great game if you did other things then just hide in the shadows. I know your a thief and everything but if all you do is hide, the game gets dull very fast."
1,Must have T&L video card!!,Don't buy this game unless you have a video card that supports transform and lighting. It won't work without it. Even many new video cards do not support this!
1,far from reality,"I've been living in Istanbul for 25 years and I adore it's atmosphere and everything. but in this game you notice extreme differences if you've ever been to stanbul. layouts and buildings are terribly designed, I'm just wondering who came over here to model the terrain and structures, graphics are totally disaster. layout looks like more Arabic or like 3rd world country. for those who want to convince themselves that Istanbul is like baghdad or any other middle eastern city they gotta come over here and take a look for a while. apart from this I already played the software and controls are wreckage!"
2,SAW it up! Throw it out.,"This LP is just CRAP! What a waste of Pete Burns. The ONLY reason I gave this LP two stars is simple (and it AIN'T ""Special Star"") is twofold: ""Something In My House"" and ""Hooked On Love"". Although SIMY drones on WAY too long. This track needs to be edited baby. SAW are at it again. Repetition and pulling Pete Burns into an abyss that took him years to escape from."
3,False advertising,"This is NOT a Max/min thermometer, despite what the name says. A Max/min thermometer shows the range of temperatures over a period of time. This is an indoor/outdoor thermometer with a lead that you can run to the outdoors through a window. It may be fine for that purpose, but I bought it thinking it was (as the name says) a max/min thermometer. I'm giving it three stars because it may be perfectly fine for what it is, but don't buy this if what you're looking for is a max//min thermometer."
1,Thermometer,"The outside reading on the thermometer is a whpping 10 to 12 degrees off. I contacted the shipper and they said they would be glad to make it good but as low as the price was on it, it wouldn't be worth me paying to ship it back to them. I guess you get what you pay for sometimes."
3,thermometer,interesting when inside and outside are 5 degrees apart in the same place. Was not due to liquids being separated
3,Looks like a typo,"A google search for Irwin 12088 will reveal that this is a tap for 0 to 1/2"". The other reviewer is correct, typo on Amazon's part."
1,Irwin Tap Wrench...,"Beware! Deceptive advertisement? Reading the advertisement for this item the average lay person would think that the wrench would open from 1/4"" to 1"". Not true, I have a tap with a 3/8"" square shank. It would not fit into the wrench...."
2,Poor Chrome Plating,"This product does what it is intended to do, however the chrome plating on the tool was done poorly. Now the plating is flaking off in little tiny pieces that look like little metal shavings all over my garage floor. Overall this tool is low quality and a poor addition to my collection. I would not recommend this product."
4,So much fun once you learn the steps,"This workout is less intense than a Cathe step tape, but much more choreorgraphically challenging and fun.For reference, this workout is less difficult than Chrisi Taylor's choregoraphy. By rewinding at the parts I couldn't do the first time, I finally learned it and had a blast - I felt like I was dancing, not doing another boring step workout.The workout itself medium intensity - you'll sweat, but you won't be huffing/puffing (well, maybe you will, it depends on your fitness level really).Kari is my new fave instructor - great cues, engaging and motivating personality. I also loved the music - none of that canned techno-y stuff."
3,"Fun, fun, fun!!",The authors have done an outstanding job capturing the character's sense of adventure and fun spirit! The unique transition from chapter to chapter keeps the reader interested. I found it difficult to stop at the end of each chapter - I just HAD to discover how it tied to the next...Great easy read - I'm looking forward to the next Tildy adventure!!
3,"Sufficiently good, but woefully short, single by REM","REM's ""Daysleeper"" single, released to promote their 1998 album UP, contains only two songs, ""Daysleeper"" and ""Emphysema.""""Daysleeper"" is the familiar song from the album, a tale of corporate angst in which a night watchman loses his sanity as the night defines his existence. It's a nice song, a little different from much of REMs work, but one of the highlights of the album.""Emphysema"" is a quirky instrumental that has a lounge-feel. It definitely sounds like a B-side, and of course is a non-album track.The material on this single is pretty good, but my complaint is that more was not offered to the U.S. audience. Although there are versions of a ""Daysleeper"" single with four tracks, they are imports.By the way, the album UP is worth getting."
5,"If you haven't seen it, you are missing out!!!",If there is one television show you can make time for this is the one. You will not be disappointed!! You will want to thank me.
5,Awesome!,"What a great show! I actually didn't want to start watching because I thought it would be another ""hospital"" show. Was I wrong! I watched one show of Season 2 and was hooked. Now I can't wait for Sunday nights. When does Season 2 come out on DVD so I can catch up??"
5,I Love It,We didn't see Season One so we rented this DVD and fell in love. The characters are irresistable; I've watched this many times and it never grows old! My favorite show on TV.
3,"Not thrilled, but satisfied","All I received was the two discs in plastic cases. I was warned that there was no ""album artwork"" but was unaware of how bare the DVD's would actually come. The season is amazing, however, and makes up it. The discs were in good shape."
2,Disappointed...,"First of all, I was very disappointed in the length of the series for the season. I knew the price was right, but didn't realize it only had a few cd's for the entire series. Also, after watching season two first, season one did not particularly impress me."
1,I'm speaking for husbands everywhere....,"OK husbands- if you want to spend some time with your wife, chances are you've been in the room when this horrible, treacly, maudlin, melodramatic, pseudo-soap has been on the tube. If so, I feel your pain. Yes, it's predictable. Yes, it's cheez whiz. But what's worse is it pretends to be a serious show. At least ""Days of Our Lives"" didn't pretend to be something it wasn't. I was so glad when Ally McBeal finally went off the air, but now there's this. McDreamy, McSteamy...last seven minutes of the show, cue some overwrought emo music, cue someone dying or crying or whatever. Yuck. Why is TV so terrible?"
5,Great show,"Well written, with intriguing character development and a health dose of heart strings pulled on. The cases the interns work often require some suspension of disbelieve but the medical terminology used and case presentations are well advised."
2,THIS SHOW SUCKS....WHAT HAPPENED,"WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO THE ORIGINAL STORY LINE OF THIS SHOW..IT'S NOW ALL ABOUT SEX, SUICIDE, AFFAIRS, BLAH BLAH BLAH....SOAP OPERA DRAMA.!"
5,Grey's Season 1,This product is just like new. It is in amazing condition and was listed at an amazing value. My hope was to start all over again since I started watching Grey's when it came out and didn't keep up. Amazing addition to my collection.
5,grey's review,I think Grey's is an excellent show. I ordered from Amazon and got my shipment in a timely manner. Excellent response by Amazon
5,Grey's Anatomy DVD Purchase,"When I received the first copy the case was broken and the DVD had come loose and had scratched the disc so that it wasn't playable. I told Amazon about how the shipment had arrived and they replaced it without hestiation. I received a new copy within a week. I try to buy all my new DVD's that I purchase via the Internet from them because I never have to worry, if there are any problems, I know it will be handled to my satisfaction. Thanks Amazon. C Young"
5,ONE OF THE BEST,This DVD set is great! I actually forgot how funny some of the things that happened in the first season were until I watched it again. They have such a chemistry together. I highly recommend this DVD set. I can't believe I have to wait a whole year for Season 2 to be released on video.
5,"A very good Medical Drama, That I thought would be Mediocre.","When I first heard about Grey's Anatomy I thought this would be another boring medical soap opera angst-fest, but it was so much more. The cast has genuine chemistry, not just between Shepard and Meredith, but between everyone. The characters are all fantastic, with their little quirks that have us begging for more than what the 1st season offered.The patients they see also have us wanting more from the characters. Its like ER that the patients any of the patients can die at any time. Its not cheesy in that the ones we love manage to live, because, on several occasions, they have died when its least expected.By having an outstanding storyline (with a jaw-dropping cliffhanger) and fantastic chemistry, the show manages to stand out among the many medical dramas seen over the years. Even though the 1st season is a bit short, its still worth checking out."
5,If Scrubs and ER had a love child Grey's Anatomy would be it!,If Scrubs and ER had a love child Grey's Anatomy would be it! Grey's Anatomy is the perfect mix of comedy and drama. It is an extremely well written show that couldn't have a better theme. The diversity of the characters is unbelievable. They are so well suited to play opposite each other. I don't think there has been a better casting combination since Friends (and that's saying a lot)!
5,McDreamy!!!!,"I own Season 1 and 2. Patrick Dempsey, Ellen Pompeo, Sandra Oh, Katherine Keigl, etc., great show! I have everyone in my family including my friends addicted to it!!! Buy it, you won't regret it."
5,So sorry I waited so long!,"I was so busy with life when Grey's started and I never got into it. So sorry I waited soo long! I love the characters and the realness of the medical portion, being an RN I tend to criticize all medical shows because of their inconsistancy and lack if medical flow, I love that the show makes me feel like it could be another day at my hospital (except for all of the sex). Great job! I am hooked!"
5,Great first season!,"This show has redefined Sunday night television and sucked me into the drama like no other show in a long time. Finally, a show that caters to twenty-somethings! This show has a way of creating a feeling of attachment to these characters... you really do care about them on a more personal level. I am so happy with my purchase. The shows keep getting better and better! I highly recommend this show to anyone - it is much more than just another medical drama. It's funny and clever! I love it!"
3,Dissecting Gray's Anatomy Season One,"It's no longer the technical procedures. Now, we are able to see doctor's having, seconds, thirds, and fourths thoughts about the way they practice medicine. We can cut straight through their skin and have a clean look at their hearts and minds."
4,Anatomy of a Series,I've never followed any medical drama series in the past. This is actually the first one I've seen and I like it. I like how there is an equal serving of blood and gore with the humour and the drama. The extra features doesn'tcarry that much punch but it's decent enough.
5,Best Show Ever,"I love, love, love this show. Great cast and original storylines. You'll be hooked from the very first episode."
2,Another medical show,Never watched it on tv - so much hype that I bought the 1st season. that's it - still will not watch it on tv.
2,unhappy,"The series is a good series but the dvd discs were defective the only part that was viewable were the previews the rest of the episodes rolled or had lines going through them, like a vhf that wouldn't track."
5,Best Show on TV,I can't wait for these DVDs to be released. I absolutely LOVE this show!I also caught it by accident - and I've been hooked ever since.The McDreamy/Meredith chemistry is fantastic.A must - for everybody.
3,"Great, pulpy fun","This med drama is, apparently by design, quite over the top - almost to the point of hilarity: everybody is sleeping with everybody, in broom closets,etc., everything is stat, a bomb blows up every second or two. There is, literally, never a dull moment. It's all fairly laughable but, at the same time, muy entertaining...Whattaya expect? Anything with Patrick Dempsey is going to be, by definition, a cheezfest."
5,Great DVD!,Awesome DVD. Perfect for anyone who is obsessed with Grey's like me or for anyone just now getting hooked on the show. Lots of cool special features. Great deal.
5,Such a great show!,I can't praise this show enough. It's one that is so entertaining that I look forward to seeing it week after week. I'm addicted to it!
5,Love IT!!!,"I love Grey's Anatomy. Just love it, my husband love to sit around on a weekend and watch it over and over! We just can not seem to get enough of it. Can not wait for season 3 to come out on box set, and we hope that this show NEVER ends its too go to end!!!"
5,What a refreshing show!,"It has been a long time since a tv drama has come out that is refreshing. Grey's Anatomy looked like just another medical drama to me until I watched it on the advice of my mother, who is like me, an avid ER fan. I am now addicted. The characters on this show are interesting, and flawed in a different way than the usual (i.e. Merideth Grey's promiscuity to which she fully admits, or Christina's incredible competitiveness even when it doesn't matter). I think that this show is very interesting and well written, and encourage any fan of drama to give it a try."
4,Do nine episodes make a season?,"Well in this case, when purchased in some sort of deal, they do. For anyone left in the Western world who hasn't been bombarded by some fan of Grey's and forced to watch it, you don't know what you're missing :) A very fun drama, as long as you can accept that it is rooted in relationship melodrama more than medical accuracy. If you're going to buy season one, you really may as well purchase Season 2 as well, because you wont want to stop."
5,So worth the time!,"LOVE THIS SHOW! I recently got hooked on it when I was flipping through the channels and saw it on Lifetime. So, I had to get caught up before the 4th season started. Very good show."
4,Awesome Series...,"When Grey's Anatomy first came out, I didn't watch it but then a friend of mine started watching it. He got me hooked on it, and I know own Season's 1 & 2, and am currently waiting on Season 3 to come in my mail. I am a Grey's Anatomy addict, ""Seriously!"""
4,Question about the pilot,I have a question about the pilot; Does anybody know the name of the song/track that is being played during the last surgery in the pilot episode of Grey's Anatomy?
1,What a disappointment,"I ordered this product about 5 weeks ago. It never arrived, so I contacted the seller who never responded. I am still waiting for a refund. My gift never arrived. What a disappointment!"
4,A series that deserves a greater box-set,"Im not doing a review on the content, that other can do better. Im gonna complain about the appearance of the box.When I first ordered this dvd, I thought it would come in a nice box with like 3-4 dvds. But instead, it come in a paper cover and a ordinary one dvd box. Doubble layer dvd. Whats that about? 387 minutes on 1 dvd (!). The only reason I get thies on dvd is to get the nice box. Like The office box or Nip tuck box sets.Otherwise, besides the ""box"", im really happy with the purchase."
1,"Remake of ER? But wait, ER's over!","If I had wanted to watch a slightly upbeat and younger ER...well...I wouldn't. And that's why I gave up on this peice of junk! (to be fair, I did watch most of the episodes rather than just watching one and baging it).The show spends far too much time on the personal lives of the characters...I mean it might just be a misunderstanding, but I was lead to believe that these characters were doctors...am I wrong? They are the most unpassable doctor characters I have ever come across in a TV series. If I wanted humour and drama in a medical series, I would watch House, because at least the cases are interesting and the people intricate puzzles. If I wanted just the humour, I would watch Scrubs.In essence, if they were curing the bubonic plague on this show, then people might find it worth watching...otherwise, avoid like the plague."
1,NOT Season 1-Episode 1!,"I love this show and have from the start.Do not be fooled-this is for Episode 1,the pilot and not Season 1!Please don't be disappointed and think you are getting the first season.If it were, there would be more than one disc that was only 60 minutes long."
1,Obnoxious music in the background!!!,Don't get me wrong but I love this show on MUTE! Thank god for subtitles! I'd give it 5 stars if it gave me the option of not hearing today's horrible music on the show!!! It really distracts than what NORMAL background music that sets some sort of mood. PLEASE NO MORE CRAPPY SONGS IN THE BACKGROUND!!!
1,Two words...,"Soap. Opera.Not only is this show completely cheesy, predictable and cliche-ridden, but it also demonstrates contempt for nursing.Alex- Like I said, I hate nurses.Meredith- What did you just say? Did you just call me a nurse?Alex- Well if the white cap fits...The characters treatment of nurses is horrible. The show depicts tham as mindless drones, unable to do anything unless a doctor tells them to.This show also pokes fun at other professions. Such as Kindergarten teaching and postal work.The characters are so arrogant that I cannot stand to watch this show.I definitely would not recommend this show. Anyway, it will probably die-off if it gets severed from Desperate Housewives.Cheers!"
1,No Way,"No way would I be caught dead owning this DVD set, or even watching this series. I can't believe that Touchstone/Buena Vista is rushing this to market (on Valentine's Day, no less) but are still stiffing us by not releasing the far superior Season Three of ""Once And Again"" (originally scheduled for 1/10/06, now indefinitely postponed.) In fact, Buena Vista touts ""Once And Again"" in the press release for the DVD set of ""Grey's,"" while still stalling on releasing the third season of ""O&A"" on DVD. Hypocrisy in the extremus, if you ask me. (You're reading this review, aren't you?) Come on Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Get off your high horse and give us quality DVD, not this twaddle. If you want to see a real medical show, drop what you're doing, and write or e-mail 20th Century Fox and ask them to release the last five seasons of ""St. Elsewhere"" on DVD."
1,Expecting Better,"I was expecting a ""New"" item to be in the plastic still. The DVD arrived in a manila type envelope and appeared to be in a used condition. This was a gift and I feel embarrassed to give without it having the plastic wrap on it. I needed it for this weekend so there is not time to return it. I am severely disappointed with this purchase."
1,"TOOK 1 AS BOTTLE DIRECTS, BUT...","GOT NAUSEOUS THROUGH THE DAY, AND COTTON MOUTH, THEN MY RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME REALLY ACTED UP...THREW OUT THE REST OF THE BOTTLE. DON`T RECCOMMEND. DIDN`T EVEN HELP ME WITH THE INSOMNIA."
3,Calling Elvis,"Several years ago I purchased a copy of the ""Live in Lenningrad"" show and have watched it many times. I am amazed by Mr. Malmsteens stage presence. As a rule I don't require fancy antics to enjoy a concert but for some reason I love this guy! He is the Elvis Presley of electric guitar complete with gyrating hips and karate kicks this guy has completly mastered the art of electric rock guitar. The more recent ""Live in Rio"" concert depicts a Yngwie Malmsteen looking somewhat akin to the ""fat Elvis"" but he can still make his guitar practically ignite with lightning fast blues- runs and explosive power- chord blasts from his 500 watt amplifiers. What makes this video worth owning is the impressive rendition of Hendrix's Manic Deppression as well as some other Yngwie favorites."
3,Overdub Heaven,"Yngwie, what are you thinking? I've heard & seen better bootlegs than this! Why do so many excellent musicians seem driven to release second rate live material when their genuine live stuff is so much better? There is none of the true atmosphere of a live Malmsteen concert on this video. And that's a tough review for me to write, as I'm a huge fan."
3,almost,I like the look of this item but all cds should be stored on it's end not flat.Storing cds flat shortens the life of the cd
5,"There's too many Best Hits Collections, buy this CD","That's right! There's Too Many ""Best Hits Collections"" of these guys. At last count there were more collections of Hooter songs than original albums issued. That's just plain WAKED. I suggest buying ""zig zag"", ""Nervous Night"" and ""One Way Home"" via the used venue here on amazon. This way you own ALL of the great music & YOU decide what their best hits are for yourself, don't let some record industry suit do it for you."
3,Sophmore Slump,"While there are some good songs here (Johnny B, Satellite) this was a weaker effort by the band compared to Nervous Night and the overlooked Zig Zag."
5,Hilarious!,"From a frazzled cat and a fat penguin running for office, to naked men in a dandy-lion patch, to a rare and hunted ""Basselope,"" Berke Breathed throws the full effect of his odd name into ""Penguin Dreams and Stranger Things"". The result is a unique and extremely entertaining cast of characters in a charming and notable environment, ""Bloom County."""
5,Edgar Cruz - Bohemian Rhapsody,"Edgar Cruz is a master Artist of the guitar and with the content of this DVD he has created a work of Art that is a tribute to Freddie Mercury's genius.Edgar Cruz's incredible talent lies not only in the arrangements and the playing of these pieces but also in the manner with which he explains the how, why and wherefore involved.The DVD is multi-regional as befits a supreme multi-talented Craftsman."
5,Excellent!,"As previously noted, Anet doesn't get as much notice as she should. By the way, go to her website (anet@shaw.ca) if you want any of her CD's. Don't pay the outrageous prices wanted by various sellers through Amazon."
2,Using PCI-Express - it's unstable,"The PC keeps locking up, and I have determined that it was instability with any PCI-express card. I swapped out just about everything, updated bios, but when I took out the PCI-x video card (ATI) and put in my old PCI video card (ATI AIW), the lockups quit. I tried another (Nvidia)PCI express card, and the lockups started again. It looks like they just haven't perfected the PCI-x slots yet. Other than this, not bad. But if your not using PCI-express, there's no point in buying this model. I've heard of others having lockup problems with these as well. Sorry, I think it's a lemon. Maybe I'll try the newer version - P5N32 UPDATE - It ended up being a lemon. I had the motherboard replaced by the folks who sold me the PC, and it now works fine (for 6 months, going strong)"
2,!!!Bad Game!!!,The Close Combat IV is better. CC5 is too easy. In this game there are not many difficulties to win independently if you play with Germans or Americans. Good topic but poor game.
2,"If it worked, It might be nice","I had CC:Bridge Too Far, and loved it. I bought this with hopes of more maps, and more weapons. My issue is I have a new Intel4 PC, and it runs everything else fine, but CC:IN takes about 2 seconds (sometimes more) before my <Click> has a reaction (ie. selection, conformation, placement, etc). With such simple graphics, and game-play, it should be Instant.If anyone knows how to fix this I will update my review, but at this point the game is unplayable."
5,Bring it on baby!,"This is the best Close Combat game that I have seen yet. I am fairly new to this series, but since I bought CC4, I have been addicted. I went out and bought the trilogy. Invasion Normandy has the best sound, graphics,and thankfully the A.I is far more agressive than ever before.There game takes you the *Invasion of Normandy* and keeps ypu there for 29 days, you must take port citys and move your men throught the deadly country side full of swarming Germans.Naval bombardment is available along with air and arty support, plus as the Germans your arty consists of 88's. And yes, there is multiplayer support for this one. I must say this is the best [money] I have spent on a game! It is well worth it"
4,great game,"This is a great World War II simulator. There are definitely some bugs in this game and I would highly recommend going to the net for fixes. This Game has better computer intelligence than Close Combat 4 but human players are far superior. the other great advantages game has is the large community of programmers that have written additional scenarios for this game. You can do battle since Stalingrad, Africa, Berlin, etc. You need to purchase this game to be able to access the free extras but if you're into strategy games this is a great time waster."
4,Close Combat: Invasion of Normandy,This is not the best but is one of the best games i've played its got good graphics and sound. Its reailistic but still has that unrealistic value we all like in games.
3,"Video is ok, probably better for older children",I bought this for my baby girl who is about 10 months old. So far she doesn't seem to excited by the DVD but maybe that will change as she gets older....
4,Customer Service,The wrong racket was forwarded by Amazon.com due to tardiness on thier part in updating the site and as such the wrong colour racket was sent thus affecting the glare of the ball as it comes off the racket. However due to good customer service by Clark Reed of the Paddle Company I was able to receive the racket which I had originally ordered in the first place.
4,Inspiring,"Beautiful book, with cute ideas for (mostly) kid oriented cakes. What I loved is that with ever design there is a suggestion for matching cupcakes within the theme, and a suggestion for slight changes in the original design that give you a total different look. Very nice and inpiring pictures. I'm giving it four stars because I am used to the elaborate 'how to's' in Debbie Brown's books and find those directions (and step by step pictures) better. This one is definately one every cake decorator interested in sculpted fondant cakes must have."
4,This looks good,"I came across this movie by looking up Yul Bunner, never knew it existed. Being a movie buff, but no expert on movies just like watching, especially spy stuff. Reading all the reviews on this, I would really like to buy this, only there is no mention of what language they speak in this film. I see the title on the DVD is in German, someone forgot to coment on that. Several actors are German, like Romy Schneider, born in Vienna, one of my favourites, so is Gert Froebe. Of course Yul Brunner is on top of my list. So, how can I find out what language they speak? However, not having seen this, but had to rate it anyway, I gave it 4 stars that's how good it look to me."
4,History of Science more than Mammoths,"This book was not really what I had in mind, but I ended up enjoying it anyway. I was looking to find out more about mammoths, but the book only touched on the actual natural history of mammoths in a limited way. There were so many other revelations, though: people finding mammoth bones at one time thought they were ""sports of nature"", spontaneously produced by the generative capacities of the earth and not representing any living creature. Mammoth bones are the origin of many giant myths. In Siberia, mammoth bones would seem to burst up from the ground with the thaw, leading to a belief that they were from a burrowing creature that would die on exposure to light. The book was dense and slow reading, but I've found myself relating things I learned in this book to many people since finishing it. I guess it goes to show you sometimes find good things by accident..."
1,not their best,"first thing i'd like to say is that mick shouls have never left the clash.now with that's out of the way.i've never really gotten into b.a.d. like i did with the clash(the greatest punk bands ever and one of my fav. bands)the reson why i say get this album is cause it shows mick's creative side,a side that made him leave the clash cause he wanted to continue to expirement with sounds like on combat rock and joe favored the punk.another reason to get this is because joe strummer produced it along with mick.some people think flea is the flea from the chili peppers(my favourite band)well he's not(go to the b.a.d. page and it tells his real name and it's not mike balzary like flea from the peppers is)for a better b.a.d. album go get the globe or higher power or even their latest f-punk."
4,"Decent, but doesn't make me forget the Clash","Mick Jones spinoff group BAD 2nd release has some catchy tunes on it but isn't as strong as this groups first effort. This disc is a little heavy on the mixy, scratching records sound. I really like ""Limbo the Law"". Gonna get wild, make like rock n roll!!"
4,Sample-heavy,"Though not quite as good as the band's first album, ""No. 10 Upping Street"" still contains enough good songs to make it worthwhile. The best are ""C'mon Every Beatbox,"" ""Limbo the Law,"" ""Sambadrome,"" and the drum machine solo ""V. Thirteen."" The signature B.A.D. sound of heavy sampling over a reggae, rap and synth-dance beats is ever present. It's a bracing mixture for those used to the type of material leader Mick Jones used to produce with his former mates in The Clash. But in its own way, it is every bit as challenging."
2,For Hard Core Fans Only,"Mostly bland, by this time it seemed that BAD was dead in the water, nothing here matches the excitement of THIS IS. Especially annoying are `Sightsee MC!', `Ice Cool Killer' and `The Big V'. BAD goes rap? No thanks. It's easy to see why they did the whole BAD 2 thing. Buy THE GLOBE instead."
1,Old Batteries - High Price,"These should no longer be considered ""high energy"" batteries. They are only 650mh (most batteries are not _at last_ 750mh). The price is equal to other, more powerfull batteries being sold in most retail stores. I'd recommend that you stay away from these batteries as, at $7.00, they are no less expensive then the better batteries you can buy in your local retail store."
2,Not as great as i expected them to be,I am using these for my MP3 player. I have a 1GB Creative Nano Plus. Even after a complete charge the player does not show all 3 bars for the battery strengh on the display. i can see all 3 bars with regular batteries. They last for a little lesser time than these batteries. I would recommend on trying the Sony rechargeables. They are the same price for 4 AAA batteries.
3,pikachu,"product was everything exdpexted, just not quite as durable as one would expext a childs costume to be. The mask was not good for visibility, again something that one expects in a childrens costume."
4,I found this very useful.,"I found the DVD to be a very useful adjunct toTitanic's Last Secrets: The Further Adventures of Shadow Divers John Chatterton and Richie Kohler, although I wish the main video or the extra stuff had shown the updated info on the expansion joints of Titanic and Brittanic. The extra stuff includes an older documentary on Titanic and her sisters, which helped shed a little bit of light on the question. If you liked the book, I highly suggest the DVD to help with putting all the information together."
5,Educational and Interesting,"I have had a great interest in Titanic since I was a young child, and this is a great documentary. It goes into some of the lesser known more recent information found as people have continued to research and explore the wreck and surrounding debris field. I greatly enjoyed it and would recommend it to others who have an interest in the wreck and are not as familiar with some of the new break up theories that have come into light with recent discoveries."
5,Some Great Moments,"This is one of the more interesting of the many Titanic porn DVDs. There are a lot of logistics and mechanical underwater scenes involving rovers and such, as well as the analytical revelations for the accident. I find a lot of this to be in the category of navel gazing, although it is interesting to learn that the actual breaking of the ship was likely nothing like James Cameron's theatrical embellishment. Comparisons of underwater details with mechanical drawings are also a nice inclusion, as well as a brief analysis of the ice that formed and drifted into her path. But the actual history, archival footage, interviews with historians, and computer animations of the ship are interspersed with the analytical material to make this a wonderful DVD for any Titanic or liner enthusiast to have. Included are bonus features; ""History's Mysteries: Doomed Sisters of the Titanic"" and ""History in the Making: Titanic"", which make this well worth owning."
3,Updates where art thou?,"solid product. Tons of info, challenging games cool interactivity.CONS: comes with a CD & USB cable...WHY? updates are nonexistent, support nonexistent, monthly membership for new info nonexistent---overall....good stand alone globe with electronic features"
3,Update problems,"Most of what everyone else has said, I'll second, but I want to emphasize the update problems, since they make it such a selling point. My daughter was confused that the pen told her that George W. Bush was President when she knew Barack Obama was President. I've been trying to update the pen with the most current update, but the update fails. Even that wouldn't be so bad except that the update takes FOREVER, probably half an hour. So to keep trying I have to give up my laptop for hours, but it keeps failing with no indication of why. I still haven't gotten that to work. Since it's one of their primary selling points, this is a major fail."
3,LOVE IT BUT....,"Love this product, but we had to return it. I had the leap frog one, but we thought this one will be cool . We had acess code problem. I felt very dissapointed. My parent is still hoping to buy me another since there is no more in the store where we bought it."
3,Finally got the pen to update,I got this for my kids for Christmas. I didn't realize what a nightmare updating the information would do. On my third try I got the pen to update. The only difference from the first two times I pressed the reset button on the pen. Hopefully this will help if others are stuck trying to update the information.
1,Piece of junk,"Don't buy this. It's a piece of junk. Really and truly you'll be wasting your money. I just tried to update my pen and now I have a useless, lousy globe. I don't go in for negative reviews, but man, this is one of the worst products I've ever purchased. DO NOT UPDATE THE PEN!"
3,"Good globe, lousy company.","This is a good globe, the kids found it pretty fun. Not earth shatteringly cool, just fun. I wouldn't pay the prices most places are selling this for, thankfully I found it for [...]at a Membership warehouse. Its worth that, but not worth anything more!The software, support, and website for this product are nothing short of USELESS. Updates are buggy and almost always crash or error out. Don't expect a response from the company, I tried 6 emails and all were ignored. Don't try calling them, their number is either busy, or they won't call you back.Overall, I am deducting 2 stars for the price and horrible company behind the product."
3,"Great Globe, website doesn't work",We have had the globe for 2 months and have not been able to download new information. I installed the pen on 2 computers and emailed/called. A few weeks later I got a email responsed back that they were updated their website and that was why I was getting error messages. I waited a week and when it still didn't work I emailed them back. No response. So for this reason I only give it 3 stars.
3,"Cool globe, useless software","Ok, first off, the globe is really cool and there is a lot of information on it. My kid loves it but the data does get repetitive. My big beef is that the USB ""SmartPen"" has major issues with drivers. I've tried installing the pen on 5 compters (4XP, 1 2003 Server) and they all fail to recognize the SmartPen. This wouldn't be too much of an issue if OrSci pacaged the drivers on the CD but they don't, you have to download a installation package that doesn't tell you where the files are. Customer Service is pretty much useless, the one time I did get a response from them they said it was an issue with my computer (all 5 of them apparently). If they could fix the issue with their SmartPen, I'd give it 5 stars. Software and support seems to be a new field for OrSci."
4,Cute,Grandson just loved the Sodor Power Crew. A nice addition to his Thomas collection.Nicely constructed and a good value.
5,Great addition to our Thomas Collection,"My 4 year old was thrilled to receive these for Christmas. There is a working light on the spotlight truck and the bucket can (manually) be raised and lowered in the cherry picker. I realize prices fluctuate on amazon, at the time of purchase the price was significantly lower than I had seen at other stores."
5,Good quality,"My son loves these trucks. As with all Thomas trains, they are sturdy and well made. A good addition to the set. My son loves to play with them with lego men in the bucket."
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this for my grandson for Halloween. The spotlight does not work and because I purchased it in Septemer, I can not return it. Not happy at all. A gift I ordered from amazon for my other grandson also is defective."
5,Sodor Power Crew,Very cute. My 2 1/2 year old grandson loves it. We explained the purpose of the trucks and we make up stories inorder to use them
3,Okay Merchandise,I received the product on time and in condition promised. Would probably order fromt this vendor again.
1,Disappointed,"I am surprised that Kathy Smith endorsed this. It is just ok, it's really not worth the space that it takes up. The video that came with it is a VHS instead of a dvd. I would say it is pretty overpriced as well. It's awkward to store and kind of awkward to use as well."
4,Practical Introduction To Spanish Conversation,"This attractive paperback book comes with a (choice of) tape cassette or CD, and takes the student from simple greetings to lessons on travel, banking, social life and entertainment. A remarkable amount of vocabulary is introduced (and there is a glossary at the back of the book), along with simple (and minimal) principles of grammar.The book is designed for use with a class, not for self-study. A teacher is necessary, because some of the material in the book is dated or regional, and might not be considered good Spanish by some speakers. The recording that accompanies the text, read by author Saloom, should be supplemented by listening to native speakers.A helpful resource for the beginning or intermediate student, when used as directed. I recommend it. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber."
1,not enough info to buy,"maybe this is not the place to write this ,but the electronic products, and games do not have enough description for me to buy on line. On the games you can't read what games are included, or for what computer they are good for. If they are CD rom or other. I also was looking for an encyclopedia cd, but don't think I found one. If I did it didn't describe it well enough for me to tell. I'm college educated in the 60's but computer only since 96. If you want to get sales up, you need to include easy way for probably 20 percent of the population to find what they are looking for. You need to have someone in you organization to look out for us old folks, and our limited knowledge of use of the internet. Not everyone can surf as you guys put it, the net. thanks for listening. If you need some one to do this job please contact me . You have my address.George Stobart III"
2,"okay, but somewhat annoying","these games are okay, but nothing great. the animation and music are cute at first, but then they just get to be annoying.i was looking for some games i could install on my laptop (a sony vaio, which doesn't have a cd-rom drive). these games require the cd-rom drive for installation (can't install over a network), and require the cd-rom to be in the drive while playing. in other words, these games won't run on a modern laptop, which is something they don't tell you before you buy."
4,fun reading,"Compare to what I usually read, this was a light reading. The writer's tone is pretty casual and relaxed, not so intense, thus you also feel relax reading it. Starting with his childhood story, he goes into personal and professional experience at ABT, and at NYCB. The episodes with ""Misha"" the superstar and director at ABT, Gelsy Kirkland the great but ""mean"" ballerina (though he doesn't say it that way), etc. are quite interesting to read. His writing is not that powerful or skilled, but he has a disarming tone, which makes you feel you're always welcome in his world. He seems to be very sweet and kind by nature, and it shows in this book."
1,Pas de DON'T!!!!!,"A rotten book in and out...shame on me for buying it in the 99 cent rack just to look at his hot ballet body on the cover. By the way...there were MANY copies of this book in the bargain rack...and as I see I am the first one to review this, apparantly I was the only one stupid enough to buy it. But <as I see it is mercifully out of print> should you find it in a 99 cent rack and like to support the literary dribblings of a self-important egomaniac valiantly trying to make his self-centered life sound interesting; buy all means purchase this tome!!!"
2,star-studded dull performance,"Despite the vocal stars (and the previous effusive reviews), this performance is quite simply dull thanks to the leaden conducting. The camera work is annoying in its preference for closeups instead of taking a nice perspective and letting us focus on the overall action. Pavarotti is certainly better than he is today but still has the annoying habit of ending phrases with an ""uh"". The von Karajan film with Freni & Raimondi is much better (it should be on DVD soon) and the best of all is the Australian DVD. It doesn't rely on ""names"" just talent and is conducted with all the passion that this version misses."
1,Pavarotti and Freni pretending to be bohemians,"One thing I find dissapointing in many Pavarotti opera productions is that everything seems to be adapted for Pavarotti instead of Pavarotti being adapted for the plot (or the music). Everyone knows who is the star, there is no Rodolfo in Paris having a romance with a ill-fated girl; it's just Pavarotti with a wig pretending he is still able to sing a good Rodolfo and some other singers trying not to distract us. Excellent Freni does awful singing in this production and her overacting ruins her singing many times."
3,Interesting Perspective on the French Revolution,"I read this book because I wanted to see how a cook would see the French Revolution. Fanny cares more about individuals than ideology, and that's as it should be. The book does show the impact that the revolution has on her life. I found the book unexpected because Fanny's position in society and her point of view caused me to think about issues that I'd never considered previously.I wish that there were more Spice Box mysteries to illuminate other periods the way this book does with the French Revolution."
5,When Will This Ever Come Out?,"I think this show is taking so long to be released because of the rights to all the music, but come on! Cold Case is a great show. If they can't get all of the music just get as much as they can. Cold Case is perhaps the best show on network television! It deserves to be on DVD!"
5,It's Cold To Make Fans Wait This Long,"How long must the legions of fans who feel this is television's best show wait for satisfaction? I phoned Meredith Stiehm (executive producer) several months ago, and spoke with her assistant, who told me the thing holding mass production up was copyrights to all the wonderful music the show uses. Now, I can see that to a certain extent, but I have the entire collection of ""Homicide: Life On The Street,"" and it, too, uses great music in its episodes, and it's been available to fans for a year or so. Surely the money syndication brings in can make this happen for the audience that craves to own every season so far seen!It's true that the first years were my favorites, but I'll buy them all. Please, PLEASE don't make us wait much longer."
1,I want the Soundtrack!,"I adore the series Cold Case, hands down one of my favorite shows. But what I really, really, really want is the soundtrack to the show. At the end of each episode GREAT songs are featured and I would love to purchase a CD with all the songs compiled onto one disc.Missing a great opportunity....."
5,clark,"I started watching this and can't believe what I had missed. This is a origial concept compared to others that have been created. I agree with what other reviewers have stated and I will not spend my hard earned money on a product that does not stand up to it's original quality. If it is being held up due issues of the music being released, then think about this prior to taping the episodes and use only the ones willing to release their music. Smart artists will realize that they will get more exposure by releasing the rights. How many people out there found new artists you liked from movies and tv series? I know I have.Please get this issue resolved, I would like to watch them from the beginning."
5,"A high-school history teacher REALLY needs ""Cold Case"" DVDs!","Dear CC Producers: I'm a History teacher who LOVES, LOVES, LOVES the ""CC"" episodes that deal with major social issues. I'd love to use them to supplement my lesson plans--so much so, I even made a ""Lesson Plan"" list of the episodes that address historical/recent social issues, such as:""Torn""--Suffrage Movement""Family 8108""--Japanese Internment Camps""Red Glare""--McCarthyism""Superstar""--Title IX""It's Raining Men""--AIDS""War at Home""--Iraq 2 WarSo...on behalf of my future students and fellow fans--PLEASE work out a fair deal and get these gems of TV crime drama on DVD! We fans will GLADLY buy them! Thank you!"
5,COLD CASE,"This is absolutely one of, if not the best tv show to come out in years! Not only is the music great so is the story line. I never get tired of watching this show and will watch re-runs over even though I can almost recite them line by line. PLEASE, PLEASE hurry up and release all the seasons. My husband has already agreed to purchase them all for me! It would be worth paying more to have all the original music and I agree with others that it has to have the music. It just wouldn't be the same without it."
5,Still Waiting...,Cold Case is one of the best dramas on tv today and I still can't believe that it is not on DVD yet. I do understand that it is from the music rights. The music just melts with the storyline perfectly and it wouldn't be the same series without the original music. The cast is top notch and the writers know how to draw the viewers into the story. All the elements come into play and the viewer is transported back in forth from present time to whatever date that the cold case murder took place in. It grips you from the very beginning until the case gets resolved. At least it is in reruns on TNT and hopefully in the near future all the seasons will be released on DVD. All the fans like myself are inpatiently waiting.
5,"Best show on t.v. in a long,long time.","Like all the other reviews I also feel this is the best show on t.v. There isn't alot of shows that I could watch every night and not get bored, this is one of them. I love the people on the show and the way the show is written and produced. They have done an excellent job. That's why it is so hard to not have this show on dvd. I hope they resolve whatever issues are stopping the production of getting this show on dvd where I can buy it."
3,Liked it better when I was 12!,"I got this book out of my Jr. High library when I was about 12 years old. The reason I was interested in it was because Bertha's niece, Sarah Van Hoosien Jones, was a patient of my mother's. Sarah recommended the book when she heard I liked books about medicine. I live in the area that is where this story takes place. So, fast forward to now and I decided I wanted an older copy to share with my mother who is now 92 years old!"
3,All the classics that keep it sweet,"The video has all of the songs that you will associate with the band; red,red wine, Can`t help faliing in love and kingston town. It is all set at a large venue in pretoria with 60,000 people hungry for the music. You will love it and will want to keep on watching it. You will soon be singing along to it."
5,PRETTY GOOD EVEN THOUGH I WAS GOING TO BUY A CONCERT TAPE.,I ENJOYED THE INTERVIEWS AND THE BITS AND PIECES OF THE DEC 31-JAN 31 GIGS. I ALSO OWN THE CD SET. IT PRETTY MUCH STATES THAT JIMI HENDRIX WAS GOING THROUGH A FUNK MUSIC PHASE THROUGHOUT THE LAST YEAR OF HIS LIFE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TAPE TO ANY JIMI HENDRIX ENTHUSIAST .
2,disappointment,"I wan disappointed when i heard this album, especially since his earlier albums were so good, this album took a little bit away from the jimi hendrix legacy!"
2,it's ALL about Race.....,"Yes, this documentary, which could have been well produced and entertaining, was very nearly ruined by the producer's obsession with the whole boring, over-played, tired race issue. As an aside, Vernon Reid nor Lenny Kravitz, et. al., have any business commenting on Jimi...for any legitimate reason. The only significant draw in this video is the concert footage and a minimal amount of backround info. Also, as touched upon in the piece, we all know that Jimi was obviously correct to have fired and replaced Buddy Miles shortly after these historic gigs. Jimi could see that Buddy's skill level was not equal to the other two group members and the music itself. Don't expect too much other than some formerly unseen but remarkable concert footage. The double CD that goes with this is the real star."
1,Where's the Music?,"If you enjoy listenting to the beginning of Jimi live, and then have his music talked over by, doesn't matter, then you'll love this. I threw the damn thing away...."
1,PIECE OF...,"I think that this video was just another example of how misleading ""music"" videos are... The labels and back text all talked about the Footage, with interviews. This remackable piece of crap, spits on hendrix's grave!! Instead of letting him and his guitar tell you how great he was. They show you a clip of it and have some great aunt's best friends gas attendents brother in-laws father tell you how good band of gypsys were. If you want to watch people talk about hendrix, get this. Other wise SAVE YOUR MONEY FROM GREEDY CORPORATIONS WITH MISLEADING INFORMATION!!!!"
4,"I'd like more concert footage, but belive me, IT'S THERE!","I own this DVD and the documentary is about 2 hrs if I'm not mistaken and is very informative. There is a separate part of the disc after the film is over where it goes back to the main menu under the heading of ""Concert Footage."" Yes, people, there is footage separate from the film! I know! A little attention goes a long way. It lasts about an hour and is in black and white. ""Who Knows,"" ""Machine Gun,"" ""Changes,"" ""Power of Soul,"" ""Stepping Stone,"" ""Foxey Lady,"" ""Stop,"" ""Earth Blues."" Yes, there is uninterrupted concert footage. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar."
1,BUTCHERED AND CONTAMINATED,"FEW THINGS HAVE MOVED ME LIKE THAT NIGHT'S PERFORMANCE OF MACHINE GUN.NEXT, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I HAVE NEVER LIKED THE MUSIC OF LENNY KRAVITZ.HIS MUSIC LACKS INNOVATION AND INSIGHT.LENNY TALKING OVER JIMI PLAYING MACHINE GUN IS LIKE A PHONE RINGING IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION WITH GOD.I DON'T NEED TO HEAR/SEE SOMEONE INTERPRET HIS PERFORMANCE,MUSIC OR PHILOSOPHY FOR ME. I AM QUITE CAPABLE. NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE AUDIENCE,JIMI NEVER DID. THE FOLKS THAT PUT THIS VIDEO TOGETHER OBVIOUSLY LACK THE SUBTLE COMMUNICATION SKILLS JIMI SO MASTERFULLY DISPLAYED THAT NIGHT.THE COMPLETE PERFORMANCE WILL REMAIN A MYSTERY."
3,oh well,"talking heads video stop making sense is how concert videos should be made.the interveiws are fine,but why cut up concert videos?I waited 30 yrs to see machine gun and some idiot thinks he is an artist and chops it up.shame on the hendrix foundation.shame shame on you!"
4,"Good concert, but stick to the CD.","I bought this video because at the time when I wanted another Hendrix album, I couldn't afford the 2-CD set. Well I enjoyed hearing about how the band got put together and about why they made the album. This video contains interviews mixed in with black and white concert footage. That's right -- black and white. It looks nothing like how it would have looked in color. Still, this is one of Jimi's best concerts. ""Machine Gun"" blew me away. ""Who Knows?"" is a wonderful track, and the interviews really make you realize what kind of band this really was. It's an incredible story. Here's my reccomendation: if you want to hear more about the Band of Gypsies, as well as concert clips, get this video. But if you want solely the concert, get the double album ""Live at the Fillmore East."""
4,JIMI JAMS AT THE FILLMORE EAST,"Jimi Rock's the FIllmore East is what this video should be called. Rare footage shot on B/W video is not what one expects but the audio is GREAT and the energy between Hendrix , Billy Cox and Buddy Miles is so charged that I had to watch it three times because I didn' t know who to focus my attention on. I kid you not! The only bone I have to pick is with the Documentry part, which is too long on interviews that seemed self indulgent and grandizing the already influential Hendrix by old road managers, producers, lawyers, etc...the best parts are the moments with Billy Cox and Buddy Miles. Why? because they were right next to him in so many ways and they know how to articulate that very well."
3,Mixed feelings - needs more music,"This band was the greatest of Jimi Hendrix. Tempos are steady, groove is deep and true. It avoids excessive studio meanderings and shows Jimi really playing. He was certainly put together with a couple of white musicians in order to appeal to white audiences, but when you put Jimi together with players that can really groove, it's a whole different world.However, this video has everyone and his brother talking over the music. It's a good documentary, but the concert footage could be more complete. ""Band Of Gypsies"" is a brilliant disc, so I hope that the CD release of this material lives up to it, but this video becomes more and more annoying, as there's not a lot of uncut music."
2,No way to remember a giant.,"The music is, to be kind - fair. Jimi is worth 3 stars but I have to subtract one star for Buddy Miles playing - boooooring. Where was Mitch Mitchel when you needed him? I LOVE Hendrix I own all the records and repurchased the music on cd later. I was inspired to play guitar because of Jimi and later the Allmans. Like most guitar players I have spent hours coping Jimis songs. Despite my honest worship of Jimi, much of his live work was many cuts below his studio efforts. He recorded 'live' in an era with poor to non-exsistant monitering systems and played at stage volumes that made recording hit or. In addition, his affection for partying and showmanship took center stage and often overshawed his playing. Want a great live recording - listen to Red House recorded 'live' in studio by the great Edie Krammer."
4,Legendary....,"I agree with Vince up there, this is a must have classic. If your even reading this, you know what I mean. The guy who wrote right above me here, is on brain-melting glue and is an idiot, and doesn't have any idea what he (she?)is talking about. What stupid moronic comments about such a classic, legendary performer AND performance.Rob Graves Gaydos (also Steelers!!)"
3,"good, but...","this was pretty good, but next time they need to show the concert the way it was originally filmed THEN show the interviews with the random friends, family, etc NOT both at the same time thus ruining the reason we bought the tape - to see hendrix rock out on guitar!"
5,JIMI AT HIS GREATEST!!,FINALLY Jimi got to play the Rhythm Rock and Blues he wanted to play before his untimely death. Still greatest rock guitarist ever. Even though the concert footage is in black and white the impact is still tremendous!! Wow! The Machine Gun performance is still the greatest rock performance I ever heard. Just to see Machine Gun is worth the price of the DVD alone.
2,Just for real fans,"The music on this disc is great, but the video portion of the concert is just for big time fans. Granted, the video technology was cutting edge for the times, but watching it just gave me a headache. Don't get me wrong, I love Jimi, but the footage included here left we wanting. Black and white is OK, but FOCUS. I think the cameramen were more buzzed than Jimi!"
1,eh....,Should not be advertised as a concert video. Not even worthy of a free veiwing on PBS. Take a pass on it.
3,C grade at best,"Don't get me wrong now, I think Band of Gypsies is some Hendrix's best work. And thats what I thought I was going to get when I randomly purchased this DVD at Best Buy.However I was wrong, though they do have some great concert footage, it is often interrupted by lame-o's like Lenny Kravitz and Slash,(usually at the best parts of the song too) talking about what the music means. LAME!!!!The DVD would have been much better if it was like the Woodstock DVD, where they played a brief Bio in the beginning and then the whole show.Furthermore, the DVD isn't all bad, it does have some rare footage, photos from the night of the shows, and detailed interviews with Buddy Miles and Billy Cox, on how the music came into fruition.So in conclusion, though the DVD does have somethings worth watching, I'm not sure its worth paying full price for (especially since all the best clips are on youtube anyway) so rent, borrow, pirate, or listen to the CD, just don't pay full price for this DVD."
3,"It's good, but...",The song Message of Love is missing from this concert and its the one song I wanted to see performed. Bring this back in and add this piece in the concert mix.
2,Hendrix - Live At The Fillmore,There are far too many interviews and not nearly enough film footage of the concert(s). Who cares what Lenny Kravitz thinks...he's making a living ripping off Hendrix. His opinion is worthless. Eddie Kramer is the only one who's comments matter apart from Buddy Miles and Billy Cox. There must be tons of concert footage they didn't use...why??? They should have shown much more of the band playing and it would have been fabulous!
5,The best guitar playing ever caught on film,"Skip straight to the end of the DVD, to the 57 1/2 minutes of uninterrupted concert footage from the Fillmore East on New Years eve 1969/70. This is Hendrix at his absolute peak, the most intense, passionate, virtuostic playing I've ever heard, and the cameras were rolling. If, like me, you've been enjoying the Band of Gypsies album for 30 years, it's a real thrill to actually see Jimi playing from that concert.Who Knows and Machine Gun are the vesions that appeared on the album. The rest of the show, Them Changes, Power of Soul (or ""Shoot Down Some Of Those Airplanes""), Foxy Lady, Stop, and the incindiary Earth Blues did not appear on the band of Gypsies first album, but are equally superb."
2,Butchered Concert Footage,"I don't mind the interviews. I prefer hearing from people that really knew him, not his self proclaimed protégé's. But the butchered concert footage (especially guitar solos) is a criminal act. This is worse than Alan Douglas hiring session men to ""finish"" Jimi's unpolished studio work (Crash Landing)."
2,No Clue!!,"Obviosly people forget why we purchase these films in the first place.To see Jimi play!Any footage of him playing live,(good or bad),should be shown without cutting it to peices. Save the interviews for VH1. I expected to SEE the concert I heard originally on vinyl,(which I still own),maybe with some stuff that wasn't on the album.I think Band of Gypsys was Jimi's best ever!!But not in this version. I'm disappointed with the video,but not the music. His playing,when he truly played, was nothing short of amazing."
4,Good but could have been better,Twenty nine or so years later we finally get to see Hendrix playing at the Filmore East with the Band of Gypsies. The documentary is OK BUT why oh why do they show interviews with other people as Hendrix is playing away in the background?What is the point of having the footage when you do not show it? For instance during the solos of Machine Gun just as Hendrix starts playing there is random footage of bombs dropping on Vietnam or an interview with somebody as Hendrix plays some of his greatest solos....we want to see Jimi play.It makes me wonder if the Hendrix Estate really understands what Jimi's music was all about.Groan....
1,what the heck,"THIS VIDEO SUCKS!!!!!!!!!THE LIVE footage of the show is the best ,but who cares what Slash has to say about JIMI.When i bought it i didn't realize it was more interviews than footage.so be aware of this.i think they should have selected a better title for it and had the footage a bonus.THE WORSE part is when jimi breaks intoMACHINE GUN and it cuts to an interview.WHAT THE @*#$.Anyways we all know the story ,so stick with the live footage3452"
1,SHOW THE BAND PLAYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO SEE!!! ANYONE WHO DIGS JIMI HENDRIX DOES NOT GIVE A FLYING F#*K WHAT LENNY KRAVITZ HAS TO SAY ABOUT ANYTHING!!!! NO MATTER WHAT HE THINKS, DRESSING LIKE JIMI DOES NOT FOOL ANYONE... HE IS NOT IN THE SAME DIMENSION AS JIMI AND HE NEVER WILL BE. ALSO, THIS IS A ""MESSAGE TO BUDDY"": NO-ONE WANTS TO SEE YOU LIP-SYNCHING AND PRETEND-DRUMMING TO ANYTHING!!! OH, AND HERE'S A MESSAGE TO JIMI'S DAD: I'M SURE YR SON IS VERY HAPPY ABOUT HIS MUSIC BEING USED TO SELL HONDAS. THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES!"
4,"good, but not as your first Hendrix dvd","This is a good dvd, but I dont know why they call it ""Live at the fillmore East"" it's not really a live show.for hardcore jimi fans like myself, anything Hendrix is good. However, you should not get this as your first hendrix dvd. I'd say start off with a live show like ""Blue wild angel"", or ""Jimi plays Berkely"", so you can see the legend at work, then go to something like this, so you can get some background info on Jimi. Overall, a very good video."
1,I thought I was buying a concert video,"This movie was a monumental screw-up and a tremendous waiste of time. What live footage they've decided to put into the movie, they ruined with interviews. If they had really wanted to do Jimi's memory justice there would have been 83 min of concert footage. Unless you're a Hendrix fanatic who wants the movie just to have it (you'll spend your time watching Montery and Woodstock), don't get it. This one will sit on your shelf."
3,"at least i saw ""some"" of machine gun",like another reviewer i wish they had let us see all of machine gun and included more songs from the concert
2,"Good guitar, not so good seller","The Bass guitar package we received was not anything like the picture or description. We ended up having to buy another amp to go with the guitar, as the one they sent was nothing like the one pictured and it was not compatible with the guitar. The seller was very slow to respond to our complaint and they lacked any type of customer service. In all fairness, the guitar is agood beginner model for our grandson."
5,A Must...,I would recommend that every dance ministry operating in the church should buy and read this book. It's worth having in your collection.
4,AWSOME,haven't fiinsh reading this but it seem to be what I was looking for... Did recommen this to my Dance Team
4,Good price,Got this for my 98 Honda Prelude along with the Denso 234-4621. One of them is intended for the front O2 sensor and the other is the rear. Its essentially the same thing but one of them has a longer cable.
4,Historic!,"I was so excited on my way home, knowing that this CD have very first songs Billie Holiday ever recorded! It was such a archeological experience - listening this (then) young girl full of life and optimism, singing her heart out to a silly songs of the day.Being young colored singer, she couldnt started with some best songs from the era and had to work on some third-rate material, but it was her enthusiasm (and her musicians, of course) that turned this silly songs into gold.This is not very best of Billie Holiday, but it is neccesary to understand her artistic growth and also a beautiful reminder that she was once happy and glowing human being, not always that sad,destroyed lady with sado-masochistic tendencies.The liner nottes are simply stunning, they are written very poeticaly and Im looking forward to collect all 9 volumes of this essential ""Columbia"" treasure!"
5,Do your homework,"Although not the forum for this, I just had to comment on the reviewer ""...not condemming, just voicing God's word."". Ever hear of the Apocryphal Councils? They have been the ones deciding through the ages what is ""acceptable"" for you to ingest as far as Christianity is concerned. Who knows how many truthful considerations, teachings, and writings they have discarded as heresy in order to appease their agenda of the time. So with respect to your quote, do your homework first before condeming history to the closed-minded viewpoint of the institution that has become the Catholic Church. We should uncover all that is possible as it will only increase our potential for learning the whole truth, and....isn't that what this is about?"
3,Addition of the Gospel of St. Thomas to the Bible,"I read a review that a guy had wrote & talked about adding this gospel to the Bible. In the process of learning about the gospel of St. Thomas, I became very confused. I would just like to quote Rev. 22:18-19:""For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book(the Bible): If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plaugues that are written in this book; and if any man takes away,God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.""I am not condemming, just voicing God's word."
4,100 of the World's Greatest Mysteries,"100 of the World's Greatest Mysteries is a good book for those who want to know trivia for Jeopardy or those who want some interesting, new dinner table conversation. E. Randall Floyd incorporates many of the world's mysteries, with some being more well-known than others, into one colorful book. Although some of the tales did not have lots of detail, most of the tales were pleasantly unusual and had enough details to keep me satiated. I especially liked the stories about the long-lost cities or empires. Once again, I wish that there was more concrete evidence for some of these tales. However, this book is not a bad collection and worth checking out in the library."
1,A re-hash of what's already been done.,"I was hoping for something original in this given the title. But it appears the author has culled other, more original writers, and re-written their work and called it his own. Try Graham Hancock or anybody else but this guy. This book isn't worth the time or money."
2,"Good Subject Matter, Poor Author","There are many interesting tales in this book. Few that have never been read before, but there is enough extra information included here to make them good for the second round. The editing is poor, with a few errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar here and there. The largest problem in this book, however is the attitude of the author. The reader can clearly tell what he is stating as fiction or myth, and what he presumes to be fact. He tells the story of the beginning of Earth (in his mind, the ""Big Bang"") as if he had been there. His annoying, persistent use of words like ""negroid"" and referring to Native Americans as ""Indians"" are both unprofessional and offensive. Over all, this pretentious bore should not be writing books on mysteries of the unknown, because he obviously thinks he knows everything."
2,sizing wrong,I ordered XL to allow circulation to help with warmth. These gloves are small. So small they are uncomfortable after 5-7 mins of wearing them. I suspect in the water my hands will be cold because they restrict blood flow. They do however appear to be well made.
5,"good thickness for griping, nice velcro strap",3mm was the right amount for whitewater rafting and swimming. The velcro strap is very comfortable on the wrist. I would buy it again
4,Good for the price.,I have used them probably a dozen times now (25-30 hrs) and they are holding up pretty well with the exception of the velcro strap that is beginning to show some very minor signs of wear. They are easy to don/doff and turning them inside out to dry is an easy task. The grip is decent and dexterity is pretty good with them as well. They do slowly leak through the seams but appear to have been glued. The water exchange is not really significant enough to be an issue for me but I use these for hand protection first and warmth factor second. I think I would probably go for thicker gloves if I was using them in water below about 60 degrees.
5,Used for Tough Mudder Indiana,These gloves stayed warm through ice water and very cold water temperatures. I was outside for 2 hours constantly in water and 30 mph wind gusts during the race and my hands were warm the whole time. I would high recommend these gloves!!!
4,Diving Gloves,"Purchased these gloves not for diving, but for clamming. Needed something to keep my hands warm while digging for razor clams in Alaska and to protect my hands from the sharp clam shells. These gloves worked like a charm, my hands stayed warm and scratch free thru two hours of digging clams. After rinsing and drying, the gloves are ready for another go."
4,they run small!,title says it - these are very tight for their indicated sizing.buy a size larger than you think you need.appear to be well made; gripping surface on palm side isnt very grippy but should help protect the neoprene from tears while trying to raise the Titanic.nice glove for the money
4,Well Made! Tight Fit.,"These gloves seem to be made well with strong stitching. They're made out of standard 3mm neoprene, so they should provide the same protection as any other 3mm neoprene glove assuming you've got a good fit. I always wear a large size glove and my fingers are somewhat slender. I ordered a large and the finger length is fine; however, they feel a bit tight *around* the fingers. If you have fat fingers these glove might be a problem for you."
2,Felt soggy in cold water--not waterproof,"Gloves were worn with fingers and palms of hands in almost 65 degree water, leaving my hands cold and the gloves very slow to dry on or removed. Water seeps into gloves through ample stitching fairly easily, and is retained in gloves. Good protection against wind and the occasional splash, but not getting hands partially submerged for any period of time and expecting a wetsuit like experience. Well cushioned, preventing rope burn and hand irritation. Not especially cumbersome, but still thick for intricate tasks. Dry warmth fairly good, but disappointing as ""cold water diving gloves."" Would not recommend or buy again for cold, wet weather."
1,"Not Waterproof, quite cold","I took these gloves kayaking in the low 30s. Water temperature was just above freezing. As the gloves slowly got wet, the absorbed water, and were useless after a short while. It appears that the seams between the fingers are not very well stitched, and water can leak in. Also, I've done some testing, and after soaking the gloves in water for 5 minutes, they were completely saturated. Not sure how these would make good cold weather diving gloved.I would not recommend anyone purchase these for cold, wet conditions."
1,This is just common sense. Save your money.,"I was disappointed to find that after the first four chapters or so, the few unoriginal thoughts Culbert has on human nature are repeated over, and over and over for the duration of the text. Culbert's central theme is that people are self-interested and usually act in self-interested ways. What a revelation! I felt ripped off by Culbert's own self-interest to sell books."
1,The other side of silence...,"I have read this book, Mr. Moon's ""Divide and Quit"", Mr. Khosla's work, ""Stern Reckoning"" amongst others on the subject of the Partition. Ms. Butalia's work is so saturated with her personal opinions and idealogy, that it almost ceases to be a work on history than the airing of one's thoughts and mindset. Almost a diatribe, if I may. I will agree with what john_galt_who has written. I think he has hit the nail on the head. I did not consider this book worth either the money or the time."
1,Book in need of an editor!,I ordered this book because I am extremely interested in theuntold stories of the Partition of India even though thereviews told me not to. I wished I had heeded the advice. The book is incredibly repetitive--to the point of being unreadable. I learned very little. Not worth the time to read or money to purchase.
1,This is not the story,"Ms. Butalia's more than 250 page book could be told in 20, rest is jibberish about ""her"" feminism, newly found sikhi, and in general absolute irrelevant non-sense.The books core is interviews with about 5 survirors, the interviews are badly done, they are really monologues. It's a shame that they told their most touching stories to her and she squandered these in her own confusion. She forgot that she is because someone didn't yield and let her be what she is, her femimism and sikhi and all. That the history shouldn't be explained but told and understood. I would recommend not reading anythings from quackpots like her and her promoter Mr. Rushdi. These people are just as dangerous as the people with guns who shoot without caring about the target."
2,Cheap clasp,"Really quick, the clasp is not actually attached to the belt by stitching or glue, it uses this sort of wedge teeth thing that comes undone randomly, even if you're not wearing the belt the teeth open up and disconnect from the belt. It's pretty much a useless product, but the belt does look pretty if you can figure out a way to maybe not use it as a belt."
3,Get ALL his classic records before buying this,"The 3 stars is a gift. I saw JB in concert just last night (10/30/99) and if only he could capture on disc the unstoppable energy of his current live show in the studio...I guess that's what ""Live at the Apollo '95"" was for. On this most recent album, its really not bad at all when its an honest-to-God BAND playing the music. But much of the album is made up of the same sort of ""modern""-sounding tracks that filled the junky '92 release ""Universal James"".It's good to know the man's still making new music as he approaches 70, but there's nothing particularly interesting here."
3,The J.B.Formula,while it's cool to hear James back and what not.nothing here really stands out.he can still groove and what have you but it's pretty much The JB Formula at work.He is still to Important of an Artist to be Ignored.alot of folks Owe Him Big Time.Just Like they owe Little Richard.
3,"Still on ""the one""","Its funky,but no new ground broken here.James Brown did ""the one"" to perfection years ago.You will be better off investing in one of the boxed sets that chronicle his sound as he was developing it.Still,I've got this one pumping in my fleetwood right now."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I had high expectations for this game given the excitement of the actual show. However, I was disappointed with game play. As the other reviewer indicated, game play is fast. No game I played last longer than 6 minutes. In addition, I had played only 4 games before I started to get duplicate questions and question categories. Now I have played 10 games-- totaling no more than 1 hour of game play-- and get duplicate questions with every game. It does not feel like the game has 2000 questions as advertised on the box. Very disappointing-- I'll stick to the show on TV.When I do not get repeat questions, the game is fun and challenging. However, I can't help but realize that the game will probably last me no more than 1 week. Maybe the gamemakers can do something to ensure that the full 2000 questions are used before repeating them."
3,Your 2 minute drill begins now!,"Let me start off saying this game is fair. I bought it because I'm into sports and my favorite Sportscenter anchor Kenny Mayne was the host. They game has many flaws though. There are not enough questions and after you play the game enough you can master it. For the first few times you play you have to know everything about every sport for the past 50 years just get a few points, but once you play a lot you master the questions. If there were a way to download more questions the game would be pretty good, but why would companies want to do something smart like that?"
3,no comparments,"This bag has no seperate compartments for things they all fall out when you open the bag. You can't really use this very well for a changing pad. It does hold more than the lamb diper bag. My daughter likes it. The back pack feature gets used. My other daughter has the lamb bag I think is better, however not with out its drawbacks too. Read my other reviews."
3,"I'd like it the way it was, please!","I know Larry Lee and the percussionists are largely inaudible, and Lee's 2 showcase pieces are missing. So? To me an accurate representation of the band and program would be preferable (with Hendrix front centre in the mix, ofcourse) than this, another revisionist mix / edit of the historic concert. The leader chose the musicians he wanted in his group, for better or worse. Let's hear it the way it went down, please! (This recalls Jon Astley's edited tracks / remix of Eric Clapton's heroin-era Rainbow concert: the origininal album, murk and all, trumps the cd!)Finally, Lee was already a fine guitarist in his own right who had already and would continue to work in Memphis with numerous musicians,including Al Green among others. This dvd should be accurate document, not a star-trip for casual Hendrix fans!"
4,"What happened to Jerry, Juma, and Larry..........","in the mix?? Is this another basterdized production reminicent of Alan Douglas's ""Crash Landing"", and MCA's ""Voodoo Soup""? We hear and see Mitch, Billy, and Jimi but nothing of the other three. I only heard Larry during ""Beginnings"" when Jimi is shown ""comping"", but otherwise nothing of the other two. This is disappointing because although the band may have been under rehearsed (so what!) it was Jimi's intention to create this sound...Why not just let it be?Five stars for the sound quality and footage. Still worth buying."
5,a brilliant document of a jaw- dropping concert,"I am happy to announce that this DVD is a joy to watch repeatedly. The sound is immaculately re-engineered by Eddie Kramer (who handled the concert sound in '69). The editing is superb! You get to watch Hendrix w/o the distraction of overly quick cutting or poor shot choices. The Hendrix Estate should be really proud of this one!My only complaint is that ""Hear My Train A'comin"" is , for some reason, absent from the playlist, although he did play it at the show."
5,AWESOME PRODUCT!!!!,"This product is AWESOME! The "" Balance Buddy' was such an ease for me to teach my son to ride his bike! In the matter of 20 min. he was riding all by himself and I didn't have to hurt my bad back by leaning over and trying to hold on to the back seat of his bike. I HIGHLY recommend this product to EVERYONE teaching a child to ride a bike! IT DOES NOT GET ANY EASIER THAN THIS!!!!! A+++"
3,Not for every bike,"The device can only used on bikes where you are able to attach training wheels. I guess this should have been obvious before I purchased, but the Balance Buddy attaches at the same place as training wheels. My son's bike doesn't have the right fittings for training wheels, so similarly this one will not attach either."
1,Don't be fooled.,"This product looks alot like other ones out there, but don't be fooled. My bike dealer let me try several on the market and he and I both agree that for a couple dollars more there are others that are more stable and easier to use. The one I used to teach my son was much sturdier and he and I both felt alot more comfortable using it. The one we used has a stabilizer bar that attaches to the seat post. That way it doesn't rock front to back like this one can. You get what you pay for!"
4,Good entertaining action army flick,"I'm not a fan of the WWE by any means and to be honest im not even sure which character in the movie was played by this wrestling guy. But after watching the whole movie, i was certainly pleased and dont regret spending the half hour watching bullets fly, stuff explode, and the story unfold. Its a pretty predictable story but a good one. If your looking for a action filled army movie with no dull moments, then this movie's for you."
1,"A complete waste of time, budget and poor acting","First of all... The producers know nothing about Bogota and Colombia in general. They show Bogota as a poor tropical crap (as usual by many US producers/directors) and I'm tired of this. Bogota is a beautiful 10 million people city located at 2,700 meters over the sea level, so it's a cold weather city/metropoli and not that tiny hotter than hell town shown in the movie.Very bad acting and stupid argument and dialogs.Don't get me wrong... I was born in Canada but I live in Colombia and I liked the past movies of the series, but this one is a big garbage and I will not waste my hard earned money on this. You'll not see accurately what Colombia really is and what happens here in this nice country so I recommend not to waste money on this nastiness."
1,This movie is going to bomb,This movie is going to bomb and the reason it's going to bomb is because of Ken Anderson. he's not the right man for the Job and all the other wwe productions bombed and I don't think Twentieth Century Fox is going to renew Vince.mcmahon's contract at all this movie is going to be a Joke.
5,Great corporate gift!,"I purchased this book for my sister who has a "" You can't believe what happened to me this time"" story ever week. In route to delivering it, my collegues got hold of it in a meeting and all you heard was laughter from the corporate conference room. One of the vice-presidents suggested it as ""The corporate Christmas gift this year""."
1,Worst airsoft gun,"This airsoft gun was just a really nice paper weight. The pellets constantly misfeed into the chamber. Half the time the pellet falls out the barrel due to a poor seal on the gun. I could fire a pellet harder by blowing one out the end of a straw. This gun was a complete waste of my money. I was so disappointed. The gun is super heavy from all the metal parts, which one would think that metal construction is better then plastic. If you like beretta than look away because this one is utterly disfunctional."
3,same ol knightowl same ol rap,"knightowl is one of the best latin rappers out there I like his music along with many others Shotcaller dosen't set anything new or good, hearing that most if not all of his music reflects on gang violence knightowl needs to go back in the studio and start making different kinds of music and learn that he don't need to glorify violence to sell music"
1,Secrets I don't know about RF Circuit design,"A terrible book. An ok book on Radio theory, with plenty of schematics, but absolutely nothing to do with design. A better title for this book would be: Secrets I Don't Know About RF Circuit Design. After reading this book you will not be able to design a single RF circuit. I recommend an engineering book: RF Circuit Design."
1,TAB? Hah!,"I agree with the other reviewers in the ""Waste of paper"" school, though I guess it's to be expected from TAB books, the worst publisher on the planet.Strange that Cotter Sayre has given this a glowing review. Anonymously! Sure hope he's a better writer than reviewer, as his book is next in my pile!"
1,a bad cookbook,This book provides very little design info and unnecessarily oversimplified theory of operation. It is a book for whom want to design by trial and error or just experiment for fun.
4,Re: Correction,"Regarding compatibility problems, I advise caution: you may find you get to some point in the game or other features and then the problems crop up. UBI Soft is, frankly, stupid for not immediately and fully supporting Windows 2000 and XP, for this title as well as older versions of Chessmaster (and Riven, etc.) so that customers who upgrade OSes don't lose hundreds of dollars of good software. For my part, I'm considering picking up an old 98/ME machine because (a) we could use a 2nd PC and (b) I want to play Myst 3!"
4,"Previous Versions Excellent, But...","...this program needs to be updated to support Windows 2000! I like the Chessmaster series very much, but am unable to play my two previous versions on my exclusively Win2K systems.C'mon Chessmaster, pull your finger out!"
2,Unfortunately Horribly Buggy on Win2k Pro,"After getting trounced in chess games at ... I decided to buy this latest version of the Chessmaster series in order to actually begin learning the game of chess.People seeing the VERY low rating I am giving this program should understand that the program is packed with goodness. In fact, it IS a 5 star program. A grand master goes over games of note, explaining all the moves he could have made, followed by the move he actually played. This I found facinating. You can play any of a large number of computer players, (all levels) and even customize the difficulty. The tutorials on the movement of the pieces are great for beginners.Where Chessmaster 8000 suffers is that it is incredibly buggy. I've had this program for a day and it has crashed more than a dozen times!!!I sincerely hope a patch that addresses this terrible problem is released soon. It clearly devalues the obviously great effort that was put into the product's creation."
3,Not bad -- but there are better,"Chessmaster 8000 is the best of the (remaining) mass-market chess games. It's fun to play against the personalities (but I can beat ones up to 1850 Elo but not Max, rated at about 1550?), and has some OK tutorials. However, it has problems under Windows 2000 (mostly a crash when you make a wrong move in a tutorial quiz), has a generally clunky feel to it, and generally feels less than solid or polished. ...I suggest thatpeople get Fritz 6 ... instead -- in the long run you'll be happier. Many (most?) serious chess players have and use Fritz, and you'll find a wealth of information related to Chessbase products on the 'net. ..."
3,Where's The Patch,"I had chessmaster 5000 and had much fun until I upgraded to win98 second edition,it wasn't fully compatible.I bought Chessmaster 6000 for the o\s compatibility,it worked flawlessly.I've now upgraded to Windows XP Pro which is NT based.I was told by several people that chessmaster 8000 would be XP and NT compatible so I bought it and it isn't.I have only one question for UBI Soft,WHERE IS THE PATCH!?It's a good program,Dont make loyal customers waste so much money."
4,CM8000,"I play this on XP and it works fine, didn't even realize other people have problems... Josh Waitzkin's analyzed games are very useful and informative. I spend most of my time in the ""classroom."" Does Fritz have one of those? I think I'd only get a new program if I run out of classroom features on this one."
1,"bells,whistles and aggrevation","chessmaster has chosen not to upgrade or patch 5500.this was a fairly simple chess engine that does what a chess program engine should do. set up the board, set the level of play you desire and play chess.set your timer if thats what you want .try and play cafe style chess with 8000.i do not want to spend my time reading a manual or switching disks nor do i give a damn about josh putzke learning centers ,quizes,rating evaluations,personalities (keep it simple stupid._ kiss"
2,chess master 8000 hangs on win2k...,"Just for the record, I use Win2K, and the computer hangs in the middle of the games. very annoying."
1,Stick with Chessmaster 7000,"Stick with Chessmaster 7000 at least it will run 90% of the time.I have 7000 and at least I can play games with it.Just bought Chessmaster 8000 and out of 4 games on the 4 or fifth move my computer locked up each time (4 times). I can't get it to play a complete game.I had no problem going through the classrooms. But, that is not what I bought 8000 for I thought it would be better than 7000.NO WAY!!!!!"
1,ink,"Listed as compatible ink cartridge. Ink quality was fine intially, but quality of the colors faded( literally) very quickly. Too good to be true for the price. Not worth the gamble to purchase."
1,Disappointing audio quality,"The audio quality of this is very disappointing with the exception of Marvin Gayes ""Whats going on"". The remastering is poor compared to the 1st volume that was remastered."
5,Wreck of the Memphis,"My father was A Warrent Machinist in charge of the engine room. He is mentioned in th book. He had his lungs cooked and spent a year growing new lineing on them. Died 1928 from pneumonia,and was told if he ever got it , he would.He was removed from the Memphis by breaches bouy. The ship is still visable in Santo Domingo harbor."
5,gabby,"luv luv this cami.,Please bring it back! Fits well,feels good on and looks great on! so comphy! Please bring back in stock its a real fav.!!!!!! thanks"
3,Longtime user has now switched,"Support falls off after so many months. Still, I take the travel ""pilo"" with me on overnight trips (and bought an expandable rolling suitcase just for the purpose). For home use, I've found a better pillow through Amazon."
4,Jerry Bruckheimer scores another sixer,"The success key to all Jerry Bruckheimer films is the brilliant music score. Stuff the songs. The score is what makes a film. Be it Hans Zimmer, Trevor Rabin, Mark Mancina or Harry Gregson Williams... The guy knows what'll go. Enemy of the state starts off with a perfect theme which gets you into the action mood, then takes you deeper into the emotional mood. Not very artistic, but it's commercial score at a very high level. Go Jerry Bruckheimer!!!"
4,Fly-in-your-Face Different....,"Cute and entertaining; not THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS, nor much like it, but a good short read, especially for dragon-lovers"
3,great if your kid has imagination,"my son loves this laptop he gets to work like daddy, but if you are looking for something fun for the kids, this prolly isn't it. it's a good learning tool but I've yet to find something just for fun about it other than playing computer. The mouse is hard to get to go where you want and click it where you want but the one on the keyboard works fine. the red backlight is difficult to see. Overall my son loves the thing but I have a hunch that most kids would get bored with it quickly."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"This unit does not have the clean and clear sound that I hoped. The adjustment of bass and treble could not achieve a good EQ overall. The volume limit is also relatively low. I have owned the Yamaha MCR series and this does not compare to those systems in terms of sound quality, rounded sound, volume or ability to drive nice headphones. After six months I decided to buy another Yamaha."
5,Great quality sound,I bought the Onkyo 315 due to the great quality of sound I got in my recently purchased Onkyo Home Theater and I couldn't be happier. I am becoming a fan. I have found out that Onkyo receivers and amplifiers offer a variety of solutions that compete with most expensive devices. Onkyo is an affordable great quality of sound brand.
2,Don't be confused from the picture!,"Don't be confused from the picture! The order only includes a single can not three, I made this mistake and spent $10 for one can, at least it works."
3,Best For Surface Cleaning,"These gas dusters aren't the best in the world, but they get the job done. If you use one it will blow away any loose dust and many larger particles. However, if you have a lot of dust build-up on your keyboard, screen, etc. there might be some that is still left behind, especially in the harder-to-get-to places, such as at the base of each key in between the keys. Therefore, in order to get a keyboard clean, you have to do some other manual work. These gas dusters are good for general, surface cleaning but you'll want to try something else for deeper, in-depth cleaning."
5,Great Organization System,This is a great peg board system. nice and sturdy. It is expandable as your tool collection expands as well which is nice.Planning on adding more panels in the future!!
3,question,"I speak Chinese fluently, but I have forgotten how to read/write=( Is this too basic for me to use with my toddler? Is this more for the adult or/and kids? My boy is about to turn 2 and he speak mostly everything in basic Chinese/English."
3,Price Above Rubies,"Movie was delivered as promised. If you are interested in Jewish History, this is a good movie to watch. Sometimes we don't have a full concept of the Oxthodox Jew. This movie will shed some light on it as it takes us into the life of a Jewish family."
2,There's something irritating...,...about a movie that embraces the notion of communicating the Orthodox Jewish culture -- but there's only ONE sink in the kitchen.
1,"""ONE OF THE MOST DISGRACEFUL MOVIES EVER FILMED""",IT'S A DISGRACE. I THINK ANY THAT EVERY ORTHODOX JEW WOULD HOLD THE SAME OPINION.
2,A Price Below Pennies,"There are plenty of better movies from Amazon than this one! I had heard that this movie was an indictment against Hasidic Jewish males and the way their society treats women. Instead the Jewish males in this movie were really good people and were trying to be patient with this woman and all her selfish ""needs"". I'm afraid she was not a very sympathetic character. She married a man she did not intend to be a real wife to. She belonged to a religion she did not intend to practice. She brought a sweet little son into the world only to abandon him. She would not nurse him and could not bear his cries. She then brought a Hispanic young male into her life only to abandon him too. She used people like kleenex, including her brother in law she was sleeping with to keep her beloved job. A real bad movie and bad main character. My wife agrees with my review completely!"
2,Oversimplification Of Orthodox Jewish Community,"The topic of a person searching for their true identity is a worthwhile one, but this film's portrayal of the Jewish community as a whole left much to be desired. Jewish people are constantly being stereotyped by people who have never even met a Jew, and this film feeds many of those stereotypes. The psychiatrist/rabbi, for example, was a very unfair portrayal. The character of Sonya's husband, too, is a major generalization.Hopefully viewers of this film will not make sweeping assumptions about Jewish culture because of the way one Hollywood film portrays it."
4,"Zellweger Shines in Excellent ""Price Above Rubies""","A beautifully rendered drama of a contemprary woman's stirring discovery of self, A Price Above Rubies is set in the context of a Hasidic Jewish/American community. Exquisitely photographed, this film's acting sparkles -- and renders a reasonably accurate portrait of an easily caricatured community. Renee Zellweiger establishes herself as a talent of unlimited possibilities. The film's feminist perspective is gracefully realized without belittling all guys -- which greatly enhances the film's power! Production design is exceptional!"
3,The Actors,"I think ALLEN PAYNE did a good job, i was so glad to see him after such a long time. I also think RENEE ZELLWEGGER was perfect in this movie also."
3,It could have been better,"I found this movie hard to follow. Renée Zellweger is playing a wife of an Orthodox scholar (Hasidic Judaism). He is very strong in his beliefs and she has no use for God. She is very much into the material world and what it has to offer. She gets a chance in the jewelry business through her brother-in-law but it has a high price. While working for him, she meets a Puerto Rican jewelry designer and artist whose work gives her joy but she also encounters grief by meeting him. The story is pretty much about a woman struggling to be herself in a rigid community. But you can also see how for some people it's very comforting to have strong rules and codes.The movie is written and edited in such a way I found it hard to follow. Especially in the beginning. It's too bad because this could have been great movie. Instead I found myself frustrated watching it."
4,What a find!,This doll in now very hard to find and I was lucky to find it here on Amazone for $14!. A charming plush doll that is poseable and comes with a DVD. There is only one story on the DVD and it comes in between cardboard (but surprisingly was not scratched). Her dress is made of a satin material. Great doll for your Angelina fan!
2,nothing spectacular,"One of the editors, Bob Grumman, suggested I read this book as an introduction to visual poetry. I'm not sure how good of an introduction to visual poetry I'd say this book is. Most of the work inside I would call visual art that uses text and words in the piece. There are a few 'visual poems'. But it is subtitled 'visio-textual art' so I guess it delivers on what it claims to. The problem is that most of the work inside isn't very good. This 'poetry' isn't mainstream because of the establishment or The Man keeping them down, it's not well-known because it isn't very good."
3,Alright!,"This game is ok. I mean it has a few cool features like the remote control thing.It's kind of a copy of Pokemon though,im 12 and I think its kind of complicated."
2,Stale Pokemon clone,"I bought this for the express intent of reviewing it for a website. As a source of humor material for my article, it's wonderful."
3,not bad...,but you can only have 4 robopon at a time and you can't pick who you start out with+there are only 4 different kinds you can catch at the begining.....it's just too much like pokemon.
3,Robopon is okay,Robopon is okay. Well it's not very good and it's not bad.I do not recommend this game to you if you like games with a lot of graphics.
4,Oldie but goodie,I bought this game for my son. He has soent hours engrossed in it. It seems to be a classic.
5,THIS IS A GREAT GAME!!!!!,This game is sooo cool!!! the ability to use a remote on the cartrege is great too.i also like how it tells you about certain time based events when they happen.i totaly recomend this game to anyone who likes pokemon even just a little bit.Even tho this game is old you should still pick it up if you can find it.ROBOPON ROCKS!!!!
3,Alright!,"This game is ok. I mean it has a few cool features like the remote control thing.It's kind of a copy of Pokemon though,im 13 and I think its kind of complicated."
4,Good choice for young children,"If you are looking for good cartoons for very young children to watch, the ""Little Bear"" series is an excellent choice. These videos are nonviolent, reasonably engaging and intelligent, and they generally teach good values and problem solving. It's not great art, but it is entertaining and won't insult your child's intelligence. Based on a series of books written by Else Homelund Minarik in the 1960s, this is good family fare -- you can park your kid in front of these films and not have to worry about disturbing or inappropriate content. Whew! Thank goodness.The episodes are short and each disc has quite a lot of content on them... a lot of bang for your buck. These have been big hits around our household. (ReadThatAgain)"
1,not worth the hype,I teach music and was unhappy with the production of this product. It was not laid out well and was not able to be used in the class room. There are much better products out there. Do not waste your money on this one!
5,Kids love it,"My 2 1/2 yr old twins love little bear! They watch this DVD about 2x per week while I clean house. After it is over they always say ""another bear mommy"", they want to see it it again."
5,Great show for little ones,I would tell anyone who has kids from 1 on up to buy these dvd's They are great for kids I have a 22 month old great grandson that has watched them on noggin for the last 8 months and I just brought him the 4 dvd's that I found to buy I would love it if they would come out with a box set of all the episodes. It is well worth the money
5,15 year old relives his toddler years,"My son turned 15 August 22. As a toddler his favorite show was Little Bear. He would sing ""Little Bear, Little Bear Sing a Song"" all day. It seemed, at the time, to be his favorite episode. A tradition in our family is for the birthday person to choose a restaurant for the birthday dinner. After dinner the family gathered round the tv. I had setup the dvd to start right when the song comes on. The expression on my son's face was priceless. I could tell that he was filled with emotion and he was overwhelmed with the memories of his early years. After watching Little Bear we continued talking about the past and how much ""fun things were when you don't have to deal with the drama and stress of high school life."" Little Bear is a treasure for my son but that evening it became a treasure for us all."
3,Middle-earth poems read by Tolkien himself,"On this cassette, J.R.R. Tolkien, the author of ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of The Rings"" reads one chapter from ""The Hobbit"", 'Riddles in the dark'. He also sing his own poems from ""The Lord of the ring"" (the first book).A great thing for Tolkien-fans, but probably not a thing for the usual reader. The length of the cassette is approx. 60 minutes."
1,bad choice,I should have paid more attention to the description. I just love the Hobbit and the Trilogy so much I jumped.
5,Down Home Cooking,"Both my daughter and I enjoy reading these recipes and the comments of the author about how she came to have them. This little book did not disappoint. If you have memories of the old-time recipes and the tales about those times in history, you will enjoy reading this gem."
3,Comment on farmhouse cooking,"It was ok but I wanted somrthing a little earlier, around 1850. I have found what I needed and I yhank you for your help."
5,Fabulous,I found this book at the library and I was enchanted. I ordered my book from Amazon and thankfully received it before I had to return my copy to the library. I made many beautiful Christmas gifts from the ideas I got from this wonderful book. This book has challenged me and showed me the way with clear directions and diagrams. I am inspired to build on the techniques I have developed with the guidance of this excellent book.
3,Not boring - but not useful for me,"It's a collection of good work from different artists.I chose this book because I needed help to make beaded beads then I expected it would help me.I found what I need on page 19, photo above right - only the picture. No project.... so it is not very useful for me for now.What should I do with a Beaded Bead Gallery if I can't get help to make a similar one?"
5,an excellent book,"The item was as expected, shipping was prompt. It was packaged well. I am pleased.I recommend this seller. Thank you. Carol is a wonderful teacher. This book is a favorite of mine. I go back to it often."
5,The Art & Elegance of Beadweaving,"I originally borrowed this book from our Bead Society but loved it so much I just had to have it myself.It has an absolute wealth of information with brilliant instructions on just so many different techniques all in the one book. This is sure to become my ""Beading Bible""."
4,Very valid statements,"I find that the author made very valid statements on the state of our society regarding obesity. The very wordy book had a tendency to seem redundant and offered ""what is"" but not necessarily ""what should be done."" I did enjoy the book, found it very informative, and concur with the contents."
2,No Numbers on Canvas,"The PencilWorks flowers and pets color by number is difficult to do. All pictures/canvases are beautiful. However, there is no numbers on the canvas itself. The numbers your supposed to use are on the directions making it difficult to find the flower or item you are coloring and what color to color it. Both me and my 9 year old were very frustrated with this one because the pictures are so beautiful, but in order to make them as you see on the box will be close to impossible. If you don't mind trying to figure out from the directions what color goes where then I would purchase this because it's an empty canvas with no numbers."
2,Hard to follow,This set of art is very hard to see and follow. Following the coloring is very hard. Its also not easy to see. I would not purchase this again.
3,Poor build quality,"Have bought numerous PowerWheels for my children and never had any problems, infact, we still have a quad that is 8 years old and still going strong. The John Deere Power Loader is a different story. Looking at the quality the day we bought it, I told my wife I was concerned about the longevity. It wasn't long before pieces started breaking off in normal everyday kid use. Definitely NOT durable. The trailor broke after a month, a mud flap cracked and broke off soon after when my child manuvered in the yard, the front-loader part is hardly functional,..it goes on and on. Most recently the gear selector disengaged so it will only drive in one gear. I took it apart to see that the connections are cheap plastic. I tell you what, if PowerWheels made this product, it would last. As cool as the John Deere looks, I'd steer clear. John Deere's modo is ""Nothing runs like a Deere"" and this hold true for the this less than quality product."
1,What a letdown!,"I was so much looking forward to a righteous dungeon crawl, and this showed promise. Previews were very encouraging. Unfortunately, the final product didn't live up to those previews.I have not experienced any of the serious technical issues reported by others, nor install issues. Performance took a serious hit, though, and gameplay was just plain tedious. The interface was difficult to use and very non-intuitive.After growing extremely bored with the first dungeon level, frustrated at the layout of the game world, and annoyed at the cursor drag and graphical performance hit, I uninstalled it and found someone else to pawn it off on. May they be more easilly entertained than I."
2,"Slow, frustrating, and boring","Like so many very early attempts at role playing games, Pool of Radiance has failed to capture the very intent of D&D. The game is slow playing, has very little plot, no room for character development, and is technically inept. Combat simuilation is so slow as to be agonizing. Once combat is entered, you can't leave. Initiative (per combat rules) is almost impossible for a player character. In the early game, you can make a load of money, but you have practically nothing to spend it on. The graphics are poor, the interface is clunky, and the game respresents a bad interpretation of the 3rd edition D&D rules."
2,This game isn't worth your time.,"I'll keep it short and sweet:Imagine Baldur's Gate I. Now slow down the action tremendously and make the plotline totally linear. Then make the game buggy - it often sputters (lags) almost like Ultima Online did back in 1997. That's essentially what you get with Pool of Radiance.Even with the inevitable release of a patch, the game itself is not compelling. You walk around slowly until you find a monster. The monster approaches you slowly. You slowly attack it and it slowly retaliates. When it's dead, you walk around some more.If you're looking for a non-linear game that you can play as a single player, I'd consider waiting for NeverWinter Nights."
1,"if you like action, keep looking...","I'll keep it short and sweet...if you've played any other strategy games with battle-oriented sequences, this one will quickly become tedious and boring. The manner in which the turn-based fighting scenes are structured are maddening. NPC interaction is silly, and movement from place to place is poorly implemented. For more fun, go to Baldurs Gate II or something like that. This game is beautiful to look at, but that is really it's only redeeming quality."
1,TOTALLY HORRIFIC WASTE OF MONEY,"WOW! I wasted my money on this piece when it first came out. I just bought it because it was a D & D RPG and I remember the old PoR (Yes, I am an old man). I am so glad that everyone (or most people) agree with me. This game sucks especially because the gameplay is SLOOOOW!"
2,Nothing too impressive,"I agree with a lot of the things that have been said already. While the graphics on the backgrounds and the animations are very good, and the sounds are good as well, the graphics on the characters are somewhat lacking. Character creation is fairly limited and somewhat bad at points (the fact that when you choose an icon for your character, you only get two options, and they are basically the same exact thing, only slightly different colors, was disappointing at best). I think where this game really loses out, though, is gameplay. It's just not fun. It plays like a Windows program, and that's just not exciting. You cannot scroll the screen beyond where your characters are standing, making the view limited. You can't rotate the view, meaning that your characters are often standing in the way of something you are trying to look at. Basically, nothing about the game screams excitement. It's a ho-hum, not really worth buying until maybe it comes down in price kind of game."
3,"It's OK. Fun, but also annoying, repetitive, and bumpy.","I like RPGs. I like D&D. This game, however, was not as good as I would like it to be. Sure, it's D&D, and it is fun for a little while, but aside from that, it has repetitive music, screwish gameplay, and just horrid graphics (at least for the people and enemies). I recommend you play this game before you buy, unless you are a hardcore D&D RPGer, or just someone with lots of money."
2,A true disappointment,"The game is so buggy, the box crawls on its own. After purchasing the game and investing about 20 hours or so, a bug halted my progress. UbiSoft has released a patch for this particular bug, but the patch is not retroactive; I'd have to start over, with no guarantee that it's truly fixed, and negotiate around the myriad other bugs within the game.To put it bluntly, it's no Baldur's Gate II. It's a dungeon crawl, and not a very exciting one at that. The only real benefit to playing it is the eye-candy provided by the spell system and by the richly detailed backgrounds - even with this, though, the game isn't worth playing at this point."
2,This pool is full of problems,"On the serface ""pool"" looks good. However just a quick look at there own tech. page, makes it clear that not all the bugs have been worked out. crashes and freezes are just for starters."
1,Save your money,"Before we even get into the gameplay issues let me say that it is inexcusable that PoR was released in such an obviously incomplete state. I would return it because of the technical issues alone. Just in case those aren't enough for you never fear, the gameplay is absolutely miserable. Characters you can't customize, random dice rolls that aren't random, I don't just want a refund, I want an apology from UbiSoft."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!,"This game is, without a doubt, the most worthless attempt to make a Dungeons & Dragons computer game. It has numerous crash bugs, boring gameplay, and more bugs than an ant farm. Did I mention bugs? It has no ""role-playing"" to speak of, you can't customize your charaters, and also has the minor problem of occasionally EATING people's operating systems. Did I mention that it is buggy? If it worked (which it usually doesn't) it would be a bad copy of Diablo II. Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape:Torment and their sequels are all vastly superior products.Bottom line: it is a 2 gigabyte virus."
3,Not That Bad...,"I bought this game based on the need for a new RPG, of which category I am hopelessly addicted. I didn't listen to the reviews simply because everyone's tastes are different. While I admit that whenever you have to have 4 patches you have a serious problem, that can be overcome. Simply install the patches, and you have a game with great graphics, and a high level of detail. Now that the price has come down, it's not a bad RPG at all. WHERE IN THE WORLD IS BARD'S TALE 4?"
1,This game is the king of stink,"I would go into a long explanation of the various issues that this game suffers from, but needless to say, scores of others have coverd that ground already. Trust them. They were right. Save your money. This game is a 50 dollar sinkhole...."
1,POOL OR RADIANCE RUINS OF MYTH DRANNOR.....,Well from the day i bought the game it wouldn't load right...i even uploaded the patches and still couldn't get the game to play right...when ever i tried to play the game the box kept poppin up need POR II HELL WHY WOULD I NEED POL II WHEN I BOUGHT POL I...........NEVER GOT TO PLAY THE GAME...I HAVE ALL THE BAULDER GATES ICEWIND DALES AND NEVER WINTER NIGHTS AND NEVER HAD A PROB WITH ANY OF THEM........UBI SOFT SCREWED ITSELF OR SHOULD I SAY SCREWED US FOR PUTTING OUT A FAULTY GAME THAT DOESN'T DELIVER...
3,Pool of radiance,Game plays fine but is a bootleg copy. Behind walls the characters tend to skeleton. Other then that it plays true to the original copy. So if you want to just have a copy of the game it works fine.
2,Don't Buy!,Too buggy and crashes a lot. Would not let me get past a certain point. Horrible remake of the original.
2,"Bad rpg, good graphics","This could have been a good game. The combat system is very true to the pen and paper D&D. The problem is that it is really, really repetitive. If you've had one battle, you've pretty much had them all. And aside from a few extra powers, the battles don't change. The RPG aspect of the game is laughable. Most of the time I had no idea when I was fulfilling quests as most are kill the bad guy in front of you. Now I have to wait for a good CRPG like Neverwinter Nights to come out. Black Isle knows how to do D&D. UBI Soft doesn't"
2,Looks good but play is lacking,"This game is ok overall but the play seems slow and the controlsaren't the most intuitive or easy. It looks pretty good butnothing exceptional here.The character customizability seems to be nonexistant, you justdistribute stat points and pick one of 2-8 character modelsdepending on the race/class choice you made.Overall it's disappointing, but that's mostly my own fault forexpecting it to have all the classes and races from DnD 3rdEdition, they left out my favorite (Wizards), and because Ithought the character developement would be more involved."
3,"Some good ideas, but potential is unrealized.","One has to be remarkably persistent if you want to play the game. Odds are you will encounter serious obstacles in trying to play the game (I have tried it on three different platforms and encountered major problems on all three), and it is amazing that a game manufacturer could release such a bug-infested product and expect anyone to buy anything else they would in future produce. In addition, the support for the game has been poor as the promised patches have been slow to appear and do not address some of the worst problems. That being said, if you are VERY patient in surmounting the technical problems, the game itself isn't that bad, though it would benefit from more NPC interaction. It is slow at the start, but gets better as it goes along. IF they get their programming act together and come up with a more varied story line, this game system could be a good one."
1,Your Money is Much Better Spent Elsewhere,"Starting off I'm stunned that a company would release a game in the state that this one was. It was pretty obvious that this game was rushed to the shelves w/out proper testing and tweaking. It's very easy to see things that were ""wrapped up"" quickly for release, even the intro movie looked to be incomplete. Among the bugs is one where if you uninstall the game it would hose your OS, nice.Past that, if you are one of the lucky ones and the game is able to run on your machine the gameplay is very lackluster. Again I blame a great deal of this on it being rushed. There are several issues with balance, you cannot customize your characters, pre-gen'd chars are better than any you can make. The storyline is HORRIBLE. It's very go to A to get B and give to C. C then gives you something else to go chase after. I really hate that they destroyed the name of such a great title. :("
1,If less stars were only possible,I bought the game. Couldn't get it to work. Waited for patches. Patched it. Still didn't work. Contacted tech support 5 times via e-mail. Still waiting for a response. This game is buggy. Beware.
1,Pool of Radiance - Don't waste your money.,"I had great hopes for Pool of Radiance 2. I had played all the original gold box D&D; games by SSI.However, I installed the game and could not even get past the intro movie. The game froze every time. My computer system met the requirements listed on the game.Eventually, I decided to remove it from my hard drive and wait until UbiSoft made a patch to let me play. -- I had read about the UNINSTALL bug, so I waited until I downloaded patch 1.1.Even with the patch installed, uninstalling POR2 crashed my system. It erased or modified some system files. I tried to do a low level restore of my system, but that did not help. The only way I could use my computer was to completely wipe the hard drive and re-install all of my software.If you don't want to waste your money or risk your computer, don't buy this game. [...]"
2,If I were you I'd pass on this one...,"I played the original Pool of Radiance on my Commodore 64 back in 1989. Naturally, I've been looking forward to this updated sequel for months. Ordered it, received it, eagerly installed it... all I can say is what a disappointment.The storyline is generic and uninteresting, the interface is cludgy and unintuitive, and there are several things that are just plain annoying. I don't know if I can bring myself to finish this game...Like the original 1988 version of Pool of Radiance, you will waste a lot of time fighting long meaningless battles for little or no experience points.All negative aspects aside, the graphics and animations are great. If you don't care about role-playing and an interesting storyline, and just want to run around spending all of your time fighting for no reason, then this game is for you."
2,Ick...,"Many hours of my life have been wasted playing this poor excuse of a game...boring, boring, boring. But I finally finished, without cheats, and solved every subquest in the game. And you know what, I'm left with the feeling I just killed a Dracolich with mediocre characters using absolutely insane weapons and armor...huge demon sword with +5 hit and triple damage on a level 8 character. PLEASE!! THAT'S SO STUPID!! I still can't believe I found some +3 warhammer with a level 1 character. This game is insanely boring and just an attempt to have a chance at killing a Dracolich, a monster that in any normal D&D situation would be next to impossible to kill."
1,"If you want 3rd Edition DnD, buy Neverwinter Nights","This game was not what they hyped it to be. It was supposed to use rules from the 3rd Edition pen and paper game which it does to an extent but the characters are not only made pretty much for you (whoopee you get to change the name) but you can only have like a total of 4 saved at one time. I was so disappointed in this game that I stopped playing before completing the first dungeon. If you are a Dungeons and Dragons fan, don't waste your money on it."
1,"Shame, Shame , Shame . . .","I really hate writing negative reviews, but this game needed it. When I first heard of PoR, I thought ""Cool, a game using the 3rd edition rules that looks pretty decent."" It was $50. The next time I seen it, I hade no money, but gave it a look anyway.It was $30. At the time I bought it the price was $20. Yes, through explaining the rate at which the price of this game dropped, I can support my opinions. Before I played the game, I gave the instruction manual a glance through, and I was horrified. There was NOTHING on quite a few things that make D&D.;No two weapon fighting, only four people to a party, VERY limited character generation, and there's more, oh so much more. I'm really glad I bought this game for only $20, otherwise I would not be a happy gamer. This is NOT a solid game and I scoff every time someone asks me about it. Don't waste the time and money we all have so precious little of."
1,Have these people been asleep the last five years?!,"Just about everything they could do wrong...they did wrong. The interface is absolutely awful. The characters move in this pokey slow manner that make you want to scream. Getting at spells goes through a multi level menu. The combat is almost exactly like the old turn based Pool of Radiance from five or six years ago. I take a shot, then you take a shot then he does, etc. Utterly lame. The adventure is completely linear. It gives you no choices and leads you by the nose. Often you don't even have a choice of right or left since the dungeons tend to lead you in a line as well. When you level up the machine decides how to allocate your feats and skill points for you. Please, please, please save your money. Buying this would only encourage them to put out more garbage."
2,Kind of a Shame,"I remember fondly the time I spent on a C64 workingmy way through the original Pool of Radiance. I wasreally looking forward to the release of this game-unfortunately it comes up dry in several areas. I won'trepeat what was said about the lack of variety in charactercreation or the agonizingly slow path to leveling otherthan to say that review is spot on. The variety of monstersyou encounter is slim, the plot is not really there at all.Finally, the combat (the meat of this game..) is plodding andtime consuming with very little flash or drama.Bottom line, and I am sorry to say it- unless you're justbetween games and have something like ""federal prison"" typetime on your hands to kill- don't waste the hours of your lifeplaying PoR."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!,"What ever you do, do not buy this game. As stated in other reviews, the gameplay is terribly boring and crashes computers on a regular basis. Do not waste your money."
1,I Want A Refund!,"After the anticipation I felt for this game, all I can feel now is bewilderment. How could this game have been released? I have played for about four hours and have given up. The gameplay is horrible. It is slow, the cursor movement is choppy and at first level my sorcerer has no spells. I am unfamiliar with the 3rd edition rules of D&D, but I always thought a sorcerer would get at least one spell so it must be a game flaw. I have not found one single quality in this game that would make it remotely fun to play.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME. You will be better off playing Baldur's gate, BG2 or Icewind dale again. If you are a fan of these games, as I am, you will be sorely disappointed with Pool of Radiance."
1,Worst...game...ever!,"This game does NOT use the 3rd edition rules. Most of the races/classes are missing (no wizards!). You don't get to pick your feats or skills. Most of the feats and skills are even missing (Monks don't get flurry???)It is also very buggy.Stay away, this game is awful. It's not even a role-playing game. It's a simple dungeon hack. Buy Diablo 2, you'll be much happier."
4,Am I missing something?,"Ok first I will say I am playing it on a very good computer so that may be part of the problem others are having. For me the game installed perfectly with no need to download patches. So far I have not encountered a single bug. In game the graphics are very good much better then most other titles. I am not very far into the game but I have noticed there is very little party interaction, but I do like the combat system. It is very different from the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale system so it may take players a few days to get used to. This is not a great game but it is by no means terrible and so far I have enjoyed the time in game."
2,"Gameplay flows like concrete, but some good points too","I was really looking forward to this game after finishing BG2 and its expansion pack. Unfortunately, it was disapointing.The game had a lot of potential, and did a lot of things right. Character generation is fantastic, and the graphics and soundare pretty good. However, it wasn't enough to make for it's serious defects. The interface is convoluted and difficult. More importantly, combat is turn-based. This makes for very slow gameplay, and it got boring quickly. Also, the story line is pretty weak, and the NPCs are flat and lifeless. To the games defense, it reminded me a little of a modern version of the old RPGs from TSI (like the pools of radiance or dragon lance games). I guess if that's what I was looking for this might have come across better. But after finishing the Baldur's gate games, this came off as needlessly slow and badly executed."
3,"a decent game, but doesn't live up to the hype","well from what everyone else has written about their copies being buggy and some not even being able to install the game. i feel luck, i ran out and bought the game the day it was released. and i had no problems installing it or playing. not a single bug so far. but and this is the major problem i have with the game, it is way too boring, not anything like it was hyped up to be. the controls are somewhat sluggish, and i hate the menu interface. but still all in all a decent game"
3,After years of patches...,"When this came out I wholeheartedly agree with the previous reviewers here--- and then some! It was awful, buggy, and slow. Now with computers much faster than the specifications required and with 4 count 'em, 4 official patches later, one having been released fairly recently by the distributer-- it's a little better. It is at least playable. You may get better play by turning off anti-aliasing features in your video card.If you have the discs collecting dust or see it in a 99 cent bargain bin, it might be worth satisfying any residual curiosity. There are still a lot of aggravating aspects, but one thing that was good was the background artwork for the time. People disappointed with it when it came out should be aware of patches up to version 1.4There are also some good mods out there for changing your character icons.Unfortunately, it still does not hold a candle to the classic 8-bit gold box game."
1,A real waste of money,"I love the Infinity Engine RPGs like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, and yes, I used to play AD&D on paper. This game was VERY disappointing. Graphics are OK, but playability is awful. Control functions are not intuitive at all... combat is slow and dreadfully frustrating. I have not experienced the bugs people complain of, but that's probably because I only played it an hour or two before quitting."
3,wait,"The anticipation of this game was too great. It does lack in some areas quite badly. I was hoping it would bring D&D to life and in that respect, it has failed. Most of all, I was looking forward to the online gameplay, but I've become a bit disappointed. It's not terrible to play, however, if you're not sure of buying...you may wait until the price comes down on this one."
2,"Versatile, but Not Smart","This unit is versatile as it will charge several sizes of batteries, BUT I was surprised to find out that it charges batteries for a fixed time of 3 hr or 5 hr for NiCd and NiMH, respectively (at 500mA)--a semi-rapid charger. The new NiMH and NiCd battery chargers (not this one) generally use some delta-voltage-current-somethingeruther and a few other newer techniques to charge batteries only up until they're full, then they trickle charge them. This Energizer model seems to use ""old"" technology to charge batteries. It doesn't matter what size/capacity/charge level, it charges them all for the same fixed amount of time. I found that it charged barely-discharged NiMH batteries for the same fixed 5 hours. To me, it should not run so much extra current through them unnecessarily. I guess it does the job, but I cannot find a ""smart"" battery charger that would charge the other sizes."
3,Not a smart charger but it has its uses and it is cheap.,"The only reason that I use this charger is in case I have a battery that is too dead to charge with my wonderful Maha MH-C801D charger. Unfortunately the Maha MH-C801D needs some slight residual charge remaining for the processor to initiate a charge, so that is why I sometimes need to use this Energizer CHM4FC for around a half a minute to give the battery just enough juice for the Maha MH-C801D to initiate a charge. The Energizer CHM4FC does not care how dead a battery is, but it does a poor job of charging compared to the my Maha which uses pulsed charging. The Maha can even erase the memory effect of old batteries. At least the Energizer CHM4FC does not burn up the batteries like those terrible life shortening 15 minute chargers however."
1,incorrect information,"this cord, which i purchased and then paid 2x the cost advertised for regular shipping, does not work with the cameras advertised. in this case, the F300. this merchant obviously does not double check their items."
5,Great .,This transfers my digital images to my computer from my older Minolta camera. I am pleased with it's performance.Just shows that older camera can still work well.
1,Cable for Dimage A1 didn't work,"Flat didn't work. Seller said it was new. I would expect that it was the same cable that a previous customer said didn't work. Wish I would have read this seller's reviews but you know how it goes; it's only a cable, bound to work. It doesn't. Can I get my money back?"
4,"odd packaging, great product","The packaging, a tiny white paperboard box inside a corrugated cardboard box the size of a shoebox, was bizarre, but I've been perfectly happy with the product. Furthermore, the price was the best I could find AND the description clearly said that this cord would work for my camera. Very nice."
2,Not Much Of A Bargin If You Ask Me!,"I had a very hard time getting into this book. The character's were cardboard to me, and although the storyline had potential, it fell flat. With Lynette constantly being put in the position of ""student"", and Adrian our wicked Viscount constantly being put in the role of ""teacher"", I had a hard time warming up to the idea of them having any sort of connection let alone fall in love.Secondary character's were helpful to the storyline and were rather interesting. This story had a lot of potential but I feel that this book fell short of the mark. This is not to say that I will write off Ms. Lee with this first for me introductory read, on the contrary I will pick her up again. I just don't recommend this book as the sole read you take with you on a road trip."
2,Not a romanace and pretty depraved....,"This book is pretty twisted and depraved. There's not really any romance. The story, though well written, is disturbing and read's more like a series of base fantasies. Not rich in language, not very indicative of the period. Overall I can't recommend this book to anyone with any sense of morality. It's one thing when a romance steps over the line and has two characters engage in a sexual act. It is quite another when the author uses the ruse of writing a historical romance to find a way to write out a bunch of sick sexual desires. I have this book one star because of the originality of plot (please let this one not be repeated) and a second star because it was well written with clearly definable characters. I think my mind would prefer to be challenged and my soul delighted rather than this smut."
2,Just ok,"I liked the premise of this story, but as I went along for the ride I found it some what lacking..... it had good potential for a GREAT read but everytime I thought something great would happen it just never did..... 3/4 of the way through it finally got a bit steamy but nothing to knock your sock's off. I guess I expected more."
1,Garbage,"What a peace of garbage, won't register, nothing wrong with my internet connection. Won't down load, hours of frustration, took a couple hours off to cool off, try again, then the same old crap. This is going back. Only reason it gets one star is because there's nothing less."
4,ZoneAlarm Zaps 'Em,"While my knowledge is pretty limited about firewalls and virus protection, between Microsoft Antispyware and ZoneAlarm, I feel pretty well covered from the bugs and viruses. Once in a while I feel that these things are too complicated for someone like me, but scratching my head once in a while is better than having my computer torched by some idiot with nothing better to do than to ruin communications for others. ZoneAlarm, even with the update to 6 whatever, is working just fine. It was worth the money."
4,The Anthology Rules,"The Fantasia Antholgy is good for people who like special features, like me. It is not so good if you have already seen the first two."
5,One of Disney's greatest cinematic achievements!,"This is truly a triumph of animation technology; one that is suitable for the entire family to enjoy. First, we have the original ""Fantasia,"" featuring crocodiles dancing with hippos to Beethoven's 6th, Dinosaurs marching to Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring"" and much more!The 2nd edition (""Fantasia 2000"") lives up to the quality of its predecessor. We get whales prancing about to Resphigi's ""Pines Of Rome"" as well as a literal nature-themed interpretation of Stravinsky's ""Firebird"" suite. Both DVDs have the classic ""Sorcerer's Apprentice,"" starring Mickey Mouse. Arguably, this is the most infamous and recognizable animated feature in Disney history.This DVD collection is highly recommended for all people, all age groups & all cultures. Simply said, ""Fantasia"" has something for everyone."
4,For Young and Not-so-young,"This is the gift that I wrote on a sticky note and told my husband that ""Santa had better leave this in my stocking...get it?""Well, he got it. And so did I. My 3yo and I have enjoyed it thoroughly.My 8 month old is fascinated with the changing colors in some of the more abstract pieces.I thought the picture and sound quality was excellent. However, I was a little disappointed in the Legacy DVD. I found it difficult to maneuver, with less material than I had presumed from advertising. I requested the Anthology version specifically because I wanted this part of the set. I think I would have been just as happy with the 2-DVD set and would recommend this to other buyers."
4,Not like the picture but good,The car is not at all close to what the picture is but it is a good car and works alot better then all the cars the track came with. You can have alot of fun playing with it. It does cost alot but It's worth it.
2,Can't use the images in the book.,"I downloaded this book. As a download it is useless to me because there is no way that I have found to use the images in projects. Neither the Kindle or The Amazon Cloud reader allows printing. Amazon, by offering this book for sale digitally, completely negates the purpose of the book. I had to return it and order the print copy. Amazon should really tell people that they won't be able to print the images when they order these books."
2,Images are generally too large and dark to use.,"I was just looking for more generic images, something I could use line work from. I probably just need another one of these books."
4,A good mix,I liked this book very much - it was a good mix of vintage images showing women in a very wide range of settings. i plan to use it for altered books and art journals and I forsee it being very useful because of the variety. I liked this better than several of the other clip art books of the same publisher; this is one of the most useful.
5,awesome,"great images, lots of them large enough to scan great. including the famous face used by fornasetti in lots of his work!"
5,Now I am Danc'in................,"I was so envious of the ""Good"" dancers.......... I was not sure how they did it or if I ever could. Chris and Julee have given me the understanding to feel the music, enjoy myself, and most importantly let my partner enjoy our dance together. Watching ""Good"" dancers is sometimes intimidating. There is something about watching Chris that gives me the confidence to believe that I too can do what is being shown. Julee gives me the understanding of what a follow looks for. I am sure they do the same for the Follows. They both exhude the fun that swing is all about. Some of the moves I learned from the tape, I used the very first time out. They worked, and the feedback about ""MY"" new moves was positive. Thanks,guys........Will there be an advanced video soon?"
5,swing videos,excellent video. Wishyou both will progress to more advanced moves and amalgamations. Thanks you jbcrespo
1,Very Disappointing,"I was very disappointed after reading your positive reviews when I didn't see this at all after ordering and trying to learn the steps that your talking about, I wonder who wrote these reviews. Someone definitely knows a lot of words but not practice. I regret ever ordering this tape."
1,A real disappointment,"I never reviewed anything before because I""ve never been this disappointed with a purchase. Im glad I didn't buy ""beginning""; I can't imagine what could have been on it! Tying your shoes? We got 2/3rds of the way through this tape and were still practically standing still. There is nothing stylish about the way these folks dance, I guess if you want a tape absolutely guaranteed not to intimidate anyone this is it. Personally I'd like to learn SOMETHING for 20 bucks. Save your money. Buy a movie with Fred and Ginger in it. I've learned more about swing from individual stills in Ken Burns' Jazz than I got out of this tape."
4,Captivating but really religious,"The Messiah of the Cylinder is an incredibly intriguing book that you won't want to put down. It is pretty obscure in the anals of science fiction but nonetheless should be read by anyone familiar with the genre. If you aren't Christian, and more specifically Catholic, the book sort of comes off in a bad way. But it is easy enough to ignore the religious dogma and focus on a plot where you don't know who is really evil."
1,Battery Wouldn't Charge,I charged the battery for over 24 hours. The battery failed to charge. I charged the battery a second time. Energizer still failed to charge. Maybe I received a defective battery.
1,beep beep,"After several days of charging in it's manufactuer's charger, the so called 9 volt battery causes only beeps (i.e. low voltage)."
1,Junk,The title says it all.. Dont waste your money... Im going to put this out with the rest of the trash...
4,Works good,We use this in our alarm clock for when the power goes out as it often does. So far this little rechargable hasn't needed a recharge & is doing a fine job making sure when get up on time when the power goes out & then back on while were sleeping. I gave it 4 stars because we haven't had it long enough to get a really good opinion on it aside from the one just given.
3,Still Going,This is a very good product! It still take a charge! Very good echarable battery. My husband uses it for his recording mixer! Good to have for outdoors use.
1,Extremely short duration,I bought this 9V battery at Target and used it in my smoke detector. Now my smoke detector beeps every couple of weeks. It was really annoying. I had to constantly re-charge it. It has much shorter life than a regular 9V alkaline battery. Now I have switched back to the old alkaline 9V batteries. My final advice: don't buy this 9V NiMH rechargeable battery.
1,Odd-shaped 9-Volt Battery,"I bought this rechargeable battery for my electric bass. I go through batteries once every two weeks, so though rechargeable would be the way to go. However, when I tried to insert the 9-Volt battery into the rear of the bass...it wouldn't fit. The battery is ever-so-slightly odd-shaped. I have no problem with standard alkaline Duracell and Panasonic 9-Volts, but not this Energizer rechargeable. I went to Radio Shack and bought one of their rechargeable 9-Volts and it fits like it should.Please Energizer, consider using standard sizing in your manufacturing! If it wasn't so inexpensive and problematic, I would have returned my purchase."
4,"Cool, but size is a little off","I've bought 4 of these, and they work pretty well, but they're a little off-sized and don't fit into everything. I'm using these in 2 Ibanez SRX705 active basses, and in my Cordoba classical/flamenco guitar, but it wouldn't fit into the slot for my Ibanez acoustic bass - it got stuck and I had to work it back out. They work fine and seem to last a good while, and I like that you can recharge them. Just be aware of whether you have enough room for it - if it's a pretty tight fit, this may not work.I haven't ever found these in any store, only the AA & AAA batteries, and Energizer makes a cool charger that charges all 3 sizes - this is the one I bought and it works well: [...]"
1,amazon.con,"I ordered a Hi Speed Inflator for my Rave water trampoline. It needed to be sent to my summer home in Arkansas. I thought it was being shipped Fed Ex or UPS but it got shipped by USPS. We don't accept mail at our summer home, so it was re-rounted and I found it on my Home door step April 28 with $12.80 postage due. Really ticked me off. Now i need to re ship it babk vis UPS or Fed Ex for an additional charge. So the item with free shipping is now costing me twice it's original cost due to the 2 additional shipping charges. Very frustrated."
2,not too appealing,I have a feeling this film was made by the discovery network because they realized their dragons special(which was excellent)should have something similar on the field of aliens. This is far too boring to be fitten into a feature length film. The concept is OK but I feel that the planet should have much more intelligence on it.The only thing stopping me from giving it 1 star is because of all the cool species.
3,The Book is better,"This show was a disapointment. It was boring and the graphics were horrible. The book which this show was based off of is much better. Read Expedition by Wayne Barlowe, and even if you liked this show Expedition has a ton of extra content and a ton of really great paintings of the creatures."
5,Very little disappointment,"Came to me in perfect condition, with no scratches at all on both the disc, and the case. I didn't pay much attention to the arrival time, but I do know that it came in the expected range of days told.My only disappointment is that the movie was a little short."
4,Fascinating film - a short review,"This is a very imaginative movie. The CGI is done well, similar to the ""Future Is Wild"" series (also very good). The interviews are interesting as well.Note: This DVD might be too scary for little kids but older children will probably love it."
4,Alien Evolution in Space,"While the reality of such a delightful robotic trek to another star system may be a century away, I was taken by the sincerity of the ""experts"" behind the alien animations. As the DVD progressed one is drawn to the two robitic vehicles and their fate. I was reminded of ""Spirit"" and ""Opportunity"" roving about The Red Planet today. This is not a DVD for those who subscribe to the religious notion of Intelligent Design, however. The DVD calls on one to think of the so many variables associated with scientific evolution. Moreover, it caused me to think how humans will evolve in space in the centuries ahead."
1,Better books available,"Ten short chapters explain puberty in boys and girls. In cartoon/comic strip format (called illustrated storylines) we are introduced to twins Matthew and Suzanne, their family and friends. They experience puberty ""firsts"" (crushes, periods, bras, wet dreams, acne). Regular text and photos accompany the storylines and occasionally refer to the storyline characters. Unfortunately, this book tries to do too much in too little space. The storylines are crowded onto the page, and confuse the reader with captions and speech bubbles that are disjointed. Information is sketchy: how to use a sanitary napkin is explained, tampons are not. When acne is mentioned ""some people find that sunshine helps."" No mention of skin cancer or dermatologists. Hold off on this title and hold onto your other puberty books like Juke's ""It's a Girl Thing,"" or Bourgeois and Wolfish's ""Changes in You and Me."""
3,ok book,It is mildly helpful. Does not have any in depth programming codes. Can be used as a reference.
2,"Right idea, wrong size","After a brief browse through this very-small-format book, I decided to return it and provide this review to warn other SAS users. If you want a pocket-size, reference-lite and are comfortable reading micro-sized text, then this book may be for you. The topics are presented in a rational sequence, but the actual size of the volume effectively makes it unusable."
1,Not a One-Day-Course,"I used SAS/BASE a couple of years ago, and stop, then I started a job where I need to start programming in SAS. I really thought that this would have been a one-day-course, but it does not allow you to learn very much in one-day.This is defintely not for a beginner."
4,Works Fine,"I bought this same product. I use it with a Netgear 802.11g router. I use all Netgear products to hopefully prevent any conflicts between hardware, but I'm not an networking expert so I'm not sure if that will really prevent any problems. But from my POV this is a safe buy. No problems so far. What I like about this product is that i can place it on a high shelf out of the way of metal objects and other stuff that would potentially interfere with the radio signal, because it's connected by USB."
3,"Didn't work with my TiVo, worked fine with Windows XP...","...but sadly, I purchased it for my TiVo Series 2 (240 series). It's not on the recommended or even the 'reported compatible' list for the TiVo (see http://customersupport.tivo.com/tivoknowbase/root/public/tv2006.htm? for that) but I figured it was worth trying. All the ones on that list are 802.11b, and since I have an 802.11g network I didn't want to slow it down by adding a b client.I will probably keep this, as it is very lightweight and portable, and it will probably be handy for adding wireless capability to computers I'm doing short-term evaluations on, esp during business travel.Setup on Windows, for those of you concerned with such things, was a snap. I particularly liked the NetGear software's more detailed signal strength graph than the standard Windows XP wireless software; this made it easier to position the adapter for best reception."
4,With the exception of a few systems - the best,"Note the Athlon processor and VIA chipsets - on the system board - have shown problematic with this device. If you do not have these, there is question - in my tests - that this is the best USB WiFi client on the market. It provides greater range than the others and is very easy to install and configure. The software, however, does not support WPA so you will need to use a third-party wpa supplicant (understood as client) or the built-in Windows XP WZC (wireless zero configuration).The device is fast, reliable and compatible. I tested it with thirteen different access points, as I do all client devices I test, and it worked with all of them and provided approximately the same throughput. This device is not as fast as the buffalo cardbus wifi clients, but if you're using a desktop and don't want to plug in a PCI card, this is about the best way to go.I hope this helps you make your decision.Tom Carpenter, Wireless# Author, Father, Husband, Techno-Geek"
1,Computer freezes,"Setup was fine. But after a few days, the computer would freeze up. It took awhile to determine the cause. I finally found that it was the wg121 causing the issue. It's a random occurance, basically it could happen in a few minutes or several hours. Tech Support is a shame. Still trying to get it to work, but from the www.broadbandreports.com forum, it doesn't look good. This seems to happen if you have an AMD motherboard."
4,Great Item.,"This USB wireless adapter worked and still works like a charm. Installation is a brease and works on every computer and laptop I tried it.Pros:1. Great operation2. Catches excellent signal over long distance due to the external antenna3. Virtually plug and playCons:1. The little prop-up antenna can break easy. The plastic is not too strong2. If you switch USB ports it will ask for the driver again!3. Does not work with Linux, but I did not fight with it too much!"
1,One big security hole,"Maybe a good enough piece of hardware. Signal and speed are average. But drivers, tools and support are extremly bad.The adapter needs an administrators account to login before it starts working. Setting it up with admin rights is not enough to use it. It doesn't come online at all before anyone has logged in and the stupid configuration utility has been able to start up. There's no way to get this working in a multiuser environment with a minimum of security. Besides, Netgear support is a joke."
4,Heidegger and the Problem of Knowledge,Amazon offered the best prize deal so I purchased the book and got it on time
2,Not very impressive...,"I am lukewarm about this cleaning kit. When I first used it, it looked like it had actually damaged the viewfinder on my camera, but repeated applications of cleaning fluid eventually restored the lens to its pre-cleaning condition. Since then, I've used it several times with my camera and my binoculars, and it definitely helps. But the results are not as good as I expect. Next time I'll shop for other lens cleaning kits before I'll buy another one from Nikon. Another small problem is that the various bits and pieces of the kit don't fit well into their storage case. As a result, using the kit is always mildly frustrating. There must be a better product out there somewhere!"

1,A disaster!,"A horrible book. The text is convoluted and never clear, the exercise problems are completely outside the subject matter of the chapters, the chapters themselves are hardly explanatory (you get two-four paragraphs of ""whats"" and maybe three examples total, and folks these chapters are meant to cover a lot of ground), and there is hardly any explanation as to WHY this stuff works. A pointless book that can only be used in conjunction to a very well taught class. This book will NEVER teach you anything by itself. I cannot see anyone who learns through this book being able to perform this math after a couple of years, it is a clear book for monkey-see-monkey-does-monkey-has-no-clue-what-went-on-but-got-the-right-answer math."
1,Unhelpful,"The explanations are dense, worked problems don't reflect concepts taught in book. It is completely unhelpful as an instruction material."
4,Try before you buy,"If you are interested in this book, you might want to look at its Google books page (for which the tinyurl is pitman-prob1993).Disclaimer: because this book was typeset with my professional typesetting system, a customized TeX, I can vouch for the quality of the math and text composition, with the stipulation that I was professionally involved with its production as a consultant."
1,Save your money,This is the worst math book I have ever read. Mr. Pitman elaborares too much on trivial material and then chokes when trying to explain anything more involved. What's even worse is he doesn't give any good examples and the homeworks problems have nothing to do with what he presents. After visiting the UVA Science and Engineering Library I discovered that every single book was better than this one. I suggest you do the same and avoid this book at all costs.
2,There Are Much Better Probability Books Out There,"This book was okay. It would probably be best for someone with experience in calculus with no experience in calculus based statistics or probability. It doesn't go as in depth as I would like it to. The material and examples in the book are too easy. I've heard of some people using it to study for the SOA/CAS Exam P/1, but I don't think it is sufficient in any way to prepare one for that exam. I've seen many probability books, but this one is at the bottom of my list."
5,"An outstanding, accessible probability book.","Professor Pitman's text was my introduction to probability, and an excellent one at that. The prose is clear and classic probability problems are used as examples and homework problems. The diagrams are modern and instructional, and the book is very well edited. I recommend this book to those interested in learning the basics of probability. P(Finding a better intro text)= 0."
4,Solid Undergraduate Text,"A useful and relatively thorough text for non-mathematics majors (who would require a bit more rigor). The organization of the text is not perfect (for example, Bayes' Rule just sort of sits in an introductory section) and keeps the book from five stars, but otherwise it's a fine introduction, particularly in light of some of the more inscrutable texts on the market."
3,Magnificent singing doesn't quite cure the indigestion,"There are some unforgivable arrangements on this crossover Cd. Even if I could imagine someone who wanted to hear both the duet from Bizet's Pearl Fishers and Home, Sweet Home (didn't Nelly Melba or Jenny Lind insert that song into the Marriage of Figaro?), the tasteless pop arrangements are almost unbelievable. Shenandoah begins with something that sounds like synthesized whale songs, or are they bagpipes? for pure schmaltz, Terfel tries a Josh Groban, turning the love theme from Titanic into an Italian wow-the-crowds. He's a sing I love, but this mix isn't something for everyone, just a lot for those who don't bother to discriminate good from bad. The great Bryn Terfel needs to exercise some quality control."
4,good racquet - great price,"For an amateur player, this is a great racquet and costs a lot less then many of the racquets out there. The only down side is now I can't blame the racquet when I lose. :-( If you are starting out or just looking for a good , inexpensive racquet, I think you will like this one. I know I do."
1,Don't waist your money,I got the red and black version for my 2004 BMW 325i. The fit is poor and they shift every time you sit down. I had a seam start comming undone after only 1 week. They are total crap. Very much regret getting them.
3,"Good as book, weird as script","We are currently reading this as part of a book study at church. This involves reading a chapter a week, writing about it a companion Epic study guide, and viewing associated chapters on the DVD during the study. What becomes painfully apparent right away is that the book functions as a script for the DVD (often verbatim) and the study guide is just a highlight reprint of the book with poignant questions. Once you get beyond the odd dilution of the book through multiple presentations, it actually raises some interesting points and is a good easy read."
4,Epic; The Story of Your Life,"A quick read that can change the way you look at your life and the world. Appeals to folks whose media savvy is moderately high. (If you don't know TV or movies, you won't get alot of his allusions.) A great book to give to friends that will not offend and will stimulate discussions."
4,Christ for the intellectal,"I have always over thought my relationship with Jesus and God. John Eldredge has guided me to the emotional connection I've been seeking. When he said God wanted with me what I wanted with him, it opened doors in my heart. This book WILL change your life."
4,"A light, easy read","Reviews here convinced me to get this book. I hadn't read anything else by this author.The book is enlightening as has been stated here indeed a good witnessing tool, but I do question a couple of things in it.Eldridge is obviously a well read reader of literature and a movie nut extroadinaire, but he uses so many parallels from Biblical stories to tales from literature and movies that one would have to had read and seen them all to really appreciate them.In one passage he describes the opening scene of The Last of the Mohicans as portraying the Trinity. I'd never heard that before and am wondering if it is reaching just a little.I'm also wondering if a lot of these parallels weren't lifted out of various sermons."
5,Epic,This is the story God is telling. It will help you grow IN Him. It will answer many question you have about your walking with God.
5,This book will deepen your understanding of the Bible,"It may sound odd, but in every Bible study I have ever been part of, I have missed the bigger story of the Bible. For the first time ever, I now get it, thanks to Epic. I have since given away at least 100 copies of this book, and everyone I have given to has told me how it deepened their understanding of God and the story He has been writing since the beginning."
5,Great Book,"This book is a short read that is sure to inspire and help you to live from your heart. It speaks of the stories we love and why we love them, because our heart desires to be that story, or to be in that adventure."
5,HERO'S HAVE AN ULTIMATE CHAMPION: No less than CHRIST HIMSELF,"John Eldredge is doing his very best to wake people up. He isalso exhorting Christian men to be MEN, - not goody-two-shoes'nice' little mama's-boys, sitting obediently and passively intheir church pews chewing gum and playing golf every availableafternoon.EPIC is a little masterpiece which defines simply and beautifully just what kindof 'Story' 'Epic' and CHALLENGEwe are all called to...PROVIDED we find the courageand humility to join the ranks of the redeemed soldiers of CHRIST.As John, Dr.Tozer, and many others have said it so very well,""we are (in actuality) living on *a battleground,* not a play-ground, ... GET WITH THE PROGRAM !""Glory and many rewards await the faithful and the heroic:WAKE UP !, men: there are battles to win and much work to do:""...the weapons of our warfare are NOT carnal, but MIGHTY THRUGOD to the pulling down of [satanic/devilish] strongholds...""This book is worth two or three reads. minimum."
2,Not Worth It,"The glass over the face was loose and rattles when the clock is moved. The battery connection is loose and moving the clock can ""disconnect"" it. Also, the photo makes it look like there is some depth and solidity. However, it is essentially a travel alarm clock in a 1.5"" deep frame. It looks good, but it's design flaws make it a case of form over function. Thumbs down."
2,BORING - RAY LIOTTA YOU NEED A NEW AGENT!,"BORING. 4 people that somehow interconnect by personal tragedies in a movie with a slow plot.The shocker here, is how come an actor like RAY LIOTTA is today doing B MOVIES or playing 3rd or 4th rate parts where was a STAR in GODFELLAS.RAY L - If you read this, you need a new agent, you are a brilliant actor wasting your time in these movies."
3,Atmospheric and poignant film!,"The tendency to tell interconnected stories has cornered many scripts in this decade. Some of them have been forgotten, but just a few have been able to achieve a respectable status. This is one of them.This picture has unforgettable moments, that remain in our memory although it never reaches the coveted dramatic oneness.Forest Whitaker adds his powerful presence in his role as a troubled man in search of love. Ray Liotta shows us his huge talent in this secondary role. But the most surprising fact was to watch Jessica Biel in the central role around which two stories are articulated. For the first time, I mu8st confess she chews the scennery in the most complex role of her career and the final outcome was succesful.Haunting, thoughtful and gloomy film superbly photographed and better edited."
2,SNORE....,Are you kidding me? I mean seriously...After the success of CRASH and TRAFFIC there have been a number of dramas released that have focused on multiple subplots involving different characters that all tie together at the end of the movie. POWDER BLUE tried to work the same formula but fails terribly. The reason POWDER BLUE fails is because it is overwrought and tries too damn hard. Its overly bleak and ultimately unbelievable. I wasn't buying any of the characters and so the story became laughable. Was I depressed after watching this movie? Yes. But only because I realized I wasted four dollars and ninety nine cents that I could have used to buy a happy meal.
1,A tragic waste of talent,"The cast provides memorable performances but the story is totally lacking due to a sub-standard script.It fails to make up for the poor writing, production and direction.I wish that I never had purchased it."
2,it took a heroic effort to finish it...,"yeah, so...i did want to see how it turned out but the ending was mostly so @#@# cliche... it's not the increduality of the stripper hooking up with the nerd mortician but just everything else so predictable. there was some potential. but it didn't pan out...about 1/2 way through the film i was tracking how much time was left and using my utmost personal control to not Fast Forward to the end.that movie plot technic, very-loosely-interrelated collage of stories that make up a single film...it's worn thin already. eg, forest whitaker never meets jessica biel in the film but they both related to the mortician at different times--but did the mortician (being the only mortician in the film) get the boys body? the tranny's body?"
2,Dull and weird and not worth your time,"You would think ""How bad can this movie be?"" Pretty bad is the answer.The fault is not with the actors, but possible in the script and certainly with the director.Portions of the story are extremely compelling, but it never really delivers."
2,Disappointment,"Disappointment is an understatement. You would think that a movie with this cast of talent would be great. Nope, the only great thing about this movie... is Jessica Biel and her nude body scene."
1,My other review,"This was one of the worst movies I have paid for, good idea put together wrong. I thought I was ordering Powder but watched it cause I paid for it. I didn't like it very much."
1,Jessica Biel Naked,"I like watching Jessica Biel naked. But Jessica it's Go Go not... cry cry. Forrest Whitaker irritated the excrement out of me. Jessica Biel is not a good actress but the story with her and Ray Liotta was semi interesting. But still this movie blows... except for Jessica Biel stripping and being naked, something that most hollywood actress's who play strippers can't seem to figure out (strippers take their clothes off)."
1,"We Should Have Nuked Vietnam, I Guess","...because the director of this junk was from there.I love Whitaker and Liotta (and Jessica Biel nude) as much as any fan of film, but this was terrible. The writing is incredibly awful. The dialogue is funny enough, though, of course, it's not a comedy. The overacting by Biel is horrendous, and also funny. The young actor with the name of Qwerty (possibly the worst, and laziest, character name ever concocted) in the film is also good. It might be enjoyable to some inebriated types due to Biel's nudity, the terrible writing and Liotta's final hilarious scene involving the actor and young boy giggling with a kite in tow in (would you believe it) a beach in heaven!"
3,Very realistic but sad,Ending is very dramatic and sad. The movie is very motivating but almost all situations in the movie are frowned upon in society.
3,Powder Blue Review,i think that this was on OK movie because to be frank it just got boring at times so i would say it was an OK movie.
4,"He's not Kieslowski, Nichols, or Tarantino but he's pretty good.","Timothy Linh Bui created one film titled ""Green Dragon"" before writing and directing ""Powder Blue."" But Mr. Bui has cinema in his family, has high aspirations, and obviously has watched a lot of high cinema. Thus he mixes up an American cocktail of a movie with traces of ""Closer,"" ""Ghost,"" ""Going my way,"" and ""ER, the movie."" And though his movie is more of a quadrigae and quiddity stamped with the color blue, Mr. Bui is no Tarantino synthesizer of movie memorabilia. The movie is full of great scenes, well directed and acted. And though Mr. Bui's Asian sensibility slightly misses the American mark, any artist will welcome and appreciate the underfunded effort of this aspiring film maker. Plus the heavy ""blue"" is ""powdered"" in the end."
4,Humanity and Love triumph over Tyranny,"During the first three chapters I considered putting it down as it seemed like nothing other than a feeble romance but soon I was proved wrong; I enjoyed the book after the third or so chapter .It is a beauitful account of how love and real humanity overcome cruel totalitarian tyranny .I found it interesting following the lives of Sasha Volynin and the love of his life Anna ,their romance and the lives of their families-people such as the cruel party apparatchik Ivan Volynin and the tragic Katya,the brave and noble Pyotr and the zealous and robust guardian of the old Russia ,Nicolai. Later we read of the younger generation:Dmitri,Sonya,Natasha,Viktor,Vitya and Andrushka and we get a good idea of life under one of the most brutal regimes in history."
1,Out of box failure,This worked for all of 1/2 cycle of the ride. I would consider this a out of box failure. The manufacturer was no help at all but Amazon too great care to replace the item with a different one.
1,BAD Shipping!,When the L'Oreal Vive came to my house all but one of the bottle where open and spill all over the box. It was the worst shipping so far and I still have not got back a response for Amazon.
5,I love this book!,"Culture Shock: Hungary, is a wonderful book, filled with great information. I'm very pleased with it. I have been to Hungary four times since early 1999, and this book hits the target on everything that I heard of and saw, while I was there. I am now planning a trip back there in late May or early June, I am so excited to have learned even more important information from this great book. Thank you, Zsuzsanna Ardo, for such an informative book. Alice The Magyar"
5,FABULOUS ACTION SERIES,This British show is so much better than The Unit. The acting and scripts are wonderful. I can't add much more than the first reviewer except do yourself a favor and get this series !
2,sizzla with training wheels,"hate to dis a culture artist, but this is limp. ok tracks with very predictable flow. me want da real ting! we gotta get over the predictable jah stuff and truly praise creation."
3,Great DVD but Mitzi is not a good character,I am in love with the Little Bear episodes. The only character I do not like is Mitzi. She rarely gets punished for the things she does and is not a very good influence. I can not decide wether to purchase this DVD because I have to skip the second story about how Mitzi breaks the rules and then doesn't get into trouble when she ends up breaking things in the house and ripping Mother Bears curtain. In the end Mother Bear laughs at the mess. I would not laugh at such a mess if it were found in my house. All other episodes are so calm and very much a good thing for little ones to watch.
5,great Purchase!,"Little bear, his family and friends encourage little kids to be gentle and playfull without, causing nightmares at night to the children."
3,Not as expected,"I thought these would be a narration of the books, which we really like at our house. In fact they are cartoon enactments that do not follow the stories exactly. Ok, but not as expected."
5,Wonderful little cartoon video!,"This video is so great! It is made up of many short cartoon episodes about Little Bear and his friends. They each teach a different lesson to children, in such a sweet way. My 3 year old son adores this video. I had never heard of Little Bear (although now I have noticed his toothpaste commercial that is on television), but decided to get this because of the high recommendations for it on Amazon. I am so glad that I did. It is now one of my sons favorites, and I have to say that I love it too, because if he is going to be glued to something, I am glad that it is something as adorable and innocent as Little Bear!"
5,Wonderful purchase,This item was wonderful for my two and six year olds who just can't get enough of Little Bear.
4,Nice story,"This movie was a mix of fantasy and reality. Perhaps more violence than I would want my 3 year old granddaughter to see, although most fairy tales do use the same themes. It was a fun departure from more adult themes. The settings were well done and the moral lesson a good one."
3,Irish Lore,"Think Romeo and Juliet...Irish Leprechaun style. If you like love stories, fantasy, and a little bit of blarney, then this miniseries is for you. It touches on the ever popular scenario of boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl are separated by conflict, and boy and girl find a way to be together. And how do they make it different? Make them an Irish leprechaun and an Irish fairy and bam...the story gets a facelift. But all aside, it was an extremely cute film and if you are interested in Irish culture than this film can entertain you with little facts here and there."
2,"Great Idea, Terrible Delivery","A Leprechaun Romeo and Fairie Juliet, a nice idea if the writing, editing, and special effects were any good. If you're looking for a good fantasy of this sort, rent Darby O'Gill and the Little People or Willow. The 10th Kingdom, Legend, and The Princess Bride will also quench a desire for excellent fantasy, but don't waste your time on this over-long, cheesy movie. I will give it a thumbs up for great costuming, make-up and some highly enjoyable characters, but it still probably isn't worth your time, though your children will probably like it."
5,movie is great.....trying to buy it from amazon is TERRIBLE!!!!,the movie is great....i have been unsuccessfully trying to get a copy of this movie thru Amazon.com.....they have changed my estimated delivery date for this movie at least 4 times now. I have been waiting over 5 weeks for it and have finally canceled the order.....
4,Great!,"I used to have this movie on VHS and i always adored it. I like films set in Ireland/Scotland/England. This has a very good story,lovely scenery,romance..although Randy Q..fits more in a comic role..so does not quite fit in this movie and as to Whoopie..of course they will try to get a big name to be in a movie to draw more people to watch it. But...This movie is delightful and the lepercauns are enchanting.."
5,Fantastic Family Movie,"What a great movie for the whole family to sit down and watch together. I thoroughly enjoyed this Movie about what happens when the Daughter of the King of the Trooping Fairies falls in love with the Son of the Leader of the Kerry Leprechauns, with the parallel story of the brash American and the stubborn Irish girl falling in love at the same time. Completely enchanting with great color,special effects and wonderful Irish scenery and a fantastic cast of Actors from Ireland, England and America. Sit back and let the Leprechaun Magic and Music take over your heart and ears. 5 out of 5."
5,Stunt Report,"Fantastic fantasy action, great FX and stunt work by the British stunt boys. But I would say this as I was Mickies stunt double, which does give a slightly weighted opinion. Seriously great blue sceen and art work. John Henderson portrays Peter Barnes' story with a great and magical touch. Giving it a brilliant flow in mithical viewing. The boys playing the Leprechauns were top knotch, even though Kieran's accent could do with some fine tuneing. I particularly like the guest apperance from the one and only CC Smiff, playing the charecter 'Head Door-Man'- Please do look out for him bursting the bubbles of guests entering the fairies party.(gripping stuff)- Tristan Matthiae also has a good little slot in the film with himself appearing as a Pooka and in the stunt credit list. Tristan can also bee seen this season at a theme park near you jumping from great heights. What more can I say? But 'Good Luck -C- stage and Good Luck Every Body'"
3,Magic and Fantasy come alive,This seemed like a cute new twist to the classic Romeo and Juliet. I definately enjoyed the setting. It reminded me a lot what it was like to dream of being a fairy when I was younger. A good film for the dreamers and the children inside of us.
3,"a great idea, but much too drawn out","It had great moments and concepts but went on and on. For those who like their fantasy tales to go at a faster pace, this isn't the movie. Some of the characters were very likable, and some were not (some of the main ones!). I would advise renting this before committing to buying ..."
4,Amazingly Wonderful,"I remember watching this in Theatre class last year and I thought it was absolutely wonderful. Fantasy has always appealed to me and I love Faeries! The plot is very much like Romeo and Juliet though which takes away some of its orginality. But other then that, I loved the movie!"
5,Great Movie!,Hi everyone! This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It pulls you into the story and makes you want to see more. The battle scenes are really good. I love the fairies and the leprechauns! My favorite character is Princess Jessica.
2,The magical Legend of the Leprechauns,"The movie itself is dreadfull, but the copy that i got for all of 33 cents was worth every penny. Needed it for a project and you guys came through beautifully. Thanks"
1,Can't belive I actually sat through it!,"Whoopi Goldberg is quite lovely in her well plumed costume and with the title Banshee, it worked well. The actual scenes of Ireland were beautiful.Everythin else was WRONG."
3,Leprechauns DVD,"A light hearted movie aimed at a general family audience.No osca here, would appeal to young children. The fairy aspect did not seem to belong with the little people,however the scenary was fine as was the lead actors."
5,Whimsical fun for everyone,"I recommend this film for all families that love a little whimsy and magic along with a great retelling of a traditional ""Romeo and Juliet"" story."
5,Great in everyway!,"The magical legend of the leprechauns has it all romance, comedy,action, drama and of course fantasy...how could you go wrong with this! It may have been a little goofy here and there but even that element adds to its overall charisma. A must see in my book."
5,May the luck of the Irish be with you!,I am Irish and I LOVE this movie. You may think that because I am Irish I love it but I bet that you will love it too. Go ahead and rent it or buy it I guarantee you are not making a mistake(If you like comedy and adventure with real humans and lepercauns. If so PLEASE LEAVE THE ROOM WHILE THIS MOVIE IS RUNNING I REPEAT PLEASE LEAVE THE ROOM WHILE THIS MOVIE IS RUNNING! ) I really hope my review is helpful to you!
2,not what i was hoping for...,"i love hallmark movies! i own a ton of them, but this is my least favorite. while the scenery is gorgeous, i couldn't get into the story. to be quite honest, i've never even been able to sit through the whole movie-i get too bored with it. to me, it needs a little more humor or something, i don't know, but maybe i'd enjoy it a little more if it were john larroquette acting."
1,BIG Disappointment!!!!!!!!!!,"Very, very BIG disappointment!!!! Not for the movie it's self, but for the fact that I was led to believe that the dvd was a NEW (which in my world means unopened, and unused) to my complete dismay, this particular dvd was old and very USED before I ever received it. Not very good for Trusting Issues!!!!!!! Yes!!! It Is going back!!!!!"
1,NOOOOO !!!!!!,"This has been a complete waste of my time and money. I love miniseries and I love Fantasy, but this is too awful to look at. The acting is not good and the way creatures move and fly is very amateuristiccally filmed. I wish I wasn't so greedy and that I had kept my money in my pocket. This can only be fun for little children, but not for adults !!!Don't buy it !!!!"
4,The Magical Legend of the Leperchauns,This movie is funny and romantic. Shows beautiful sits of Ireland that makes you want to revisit places like that on your next vacation. I watch this movie with my 10 year old and we both fell in love with it.
5,Great game.,Tic Tac Toe with a twist. Great thinking game! I give a game to my children each year at Christmas and this one was a hit!
5,This is one of our favorite games,I bought two of these as birthday gifts. This is a great game to teach strategy and it is a ton of fun once you learn how to play. Takes a few rounds to get the hang of it and not to forget the rules.
5,A Mainstream Craze Waiting to Hit,"Every gathering I go to, I bring this strange little box with wooden cups inside. Heads are scratched, questions are asked. Some people are not interested. But there is always one person who is willing to try. When I explain it, show how it's played, the fun begins. Usually about three minutes in, everyone has gathered around and wants to play.This is a craze just waiting to hit the mainstream."
5,What I really like about this toy,"is that any age can play along. My 8 year old and I have a great time with Gobblet, but it's not so complicated that my 5 year old can't join in. And it's not a game that an adult would find boring ~ there *is* some strategy involved. :o)The pieces are well made, and I like the self storing box too. It's the kind of game that travels well."
3,it's just okay...,My son got this for Christmas. We only played this once but thought it was just OKAY. Nothing exciting. Maybe we'll need to play it more to really appreciate this game. Qwirkle is a better game...we just got that for Christmas as well.
4,Great Strategy Game,"An updated version of tic tac toe meets connect four.You try and get 4 goblets in a row on the board and you have multiple sizes so as you run out of pieces to place on the board you have to remove the ones that you covered, but did you cover your own piece, your opponents or none at all. Thats the challenge remembering all of the pieces on the board.Everything was well constructed but one of my goblets is slightly distorted and does not fit over the other cups so well, which can hinder play. Still a great durable wooden strategy game though."
4,I would give it five stars...,"...if my wife didn't beat me 80 percent of the time. :) A handsome, well made wooden game. We cannot stop playing it. As we linger over coffee at Sunday breakfast, out comes Gobblet. It is so satisfying to play a game that doesn't need electricity, but does need logic and concentration."
2,Not Worth the Money,"When I ordered this product I expected a lot. What I got was a big disappointment. The hairstyles repear themselves and the accessories are mostly ugly. It also doesn't seem very realistic. A product that I enjoyed much more was the Cosmopolitan Virtual Makeover Deluxe 2. Try it for yourself, I'm pretty sure you'll like it too!"
2,Wonderful show...bad editing,"This is my favorite Lucy-Desi outing, but a very poor editing job ruins it. The whole premise of Lucy's revenge on Tallulah is making her eat strawberry pie...which Tallulah is allergic to. However, the scene that sets this up in the original version (Ethel trying to serve it to Tallulah during a dinner party, only to have it ruined) is cut out from this video. This is also the version they show on Nick-At-Nite, and it is a shame such a hack got his hands on it."
5,Great Great Great Great Great,"That is the way this HP envelope feeder works - same way every time without a hitch, day in and day out. No jams, no double envelopes, no failures - just reliable and solid service. This product will pay for itself in no time at all. Worth the investment for any office."
4,The Books and Text,"Although instantly recognizable as The Books, as others have pointed out, their sound is evolving. This CD features the human voice and spoken word against the assemblage of found sounds and music performed by these artists. I found myself moved by the patchwork of little snippets of recorded phrases and voices, representing a whole range of human experiences. Great stuff. Fans won't be disappointed."
2,Major Let Down,"I really enjoyed the first two books albums, I bought Thought for Food almost immediately after the Lemon of Pink because I enjoyed it so much. I found their sound to be quite original with an interesting balance of emotion and humor along with the balance between electronic and acoustic music.So I was really disappointed when I heard their new album. This record is clearly intended to be their breakthrough, with far more vocals and regular song structure and less expirementalism. The record even reuses some samples from old albums which was really annoying. This album lacks the interesting, unexpected twists from their previous works, and as a result comes off as generally bland and sometimes even cheesy.If you want a Books album, please check out the other two first."
2,eh...,I agree with OneLove; I found this album the be much weaker than the first two... It seemed to lack the surreal audio surprises found in the others.
4,"Language, context and music","This is a somewhat interesting exploration of language, semantics and rhythm. It is more surreal in it's use of deconstructed conversations placed with new and different contexts. Some of it reminds one greatly of Korean Samul-nori music, which relies mostly upon percussion and rhythm that is based upon the Korean language (listen to No. 6, ""An Animated Description of Mr. Maps"" for a very clear example of such. While some tracks are very ingaging and suggest a different musical line of exploration from much conventional music, there is a problematic sameness in instrumentation that is sometimes very uninteresting due to a lack of musical development. The Books could end up doing very well if they were to invest more time in their musical development of their ideas and instrumentation. Layering samples can only go so far before it is boring."
4,Love This Book!,"This is a great book if you want to ""punch up"" your Spanish and sound more authentic - that is, you do not sound like you are reading from a book. I agree with the caution that the expressions used in this book are what is spoken in the street by the younger generations. In addition, since the author is a madrileña, many of the expressions have no meaning outside Spain - the author does a good job of identifying which expressions can be used outside of Spain and which ones cannot. This book is worth the investment to inject a little fun into your language."
2,Poppin' the Hood,I originally heard a cut from this album and thought it would be a great comedy album for my collection. Unfortunately that was the only funny track on this album. It did not measure up to my expectations. Very few tracks are funny and once listened to it is better off filed in the trash.
4,Good CD,"It's a good CD most people like it but it's not for everyone. Some people find it to be too ""flutey"""
5,Great listening!!,I play this quite a bit at work... has helped reduce the amount of stress am feeling.Not to mention is wonderful in awakening my inner energies as well.
5,A Stunning Album!,This album is the very best in Reiki music with some superb sleeve notes and booklet. It is a great value for money package. Are there any more albums by Llewellyn other than the Shiatsu album that I already have?
3,Great Family Movie,"The editor's review above is incorrect--this film has nothing to do with Mississippi. The Lone Star Kid is about a compassionate eleven year old boy who becomes mayor of a small town in Texas when he witnesses an accident and a death due to lack of ambulance services. He is determined to bring big-town services to his small town. This movie is based on a true story and contains an excellent performance by James Earl Jones. If nothing else, it's worth watching for the score which is written and performed by Charlie Daniels."
4,Lone Star KID !!,"Real good story and James Earl Jones' interpretationis fabulous. After all, this is the story of somethingvery unusual for an 11 years old boy.Everyone should like it ."
2,You Can Relax Now (Audio CD) ~ Shaina Noll,"Not what I had hoped for or expected. The Birth Journey thing maybe for some...it wasn't for me. Guided mediations can be wonderful, this one wasn't it for me."
3,Not for those new to the language,"This boook may be helpful to those who have had one or two years of college level japanese or are at an equivalent speaking level. If you are in the beginning of your studies and think that this book will help acquire fluency at a quicker pace then be warned. Most of the concepts were well beyond my own pitiful knowledge of the language which rests at about one semester equivalency. I think that the book may be helpful down the road, but at the incipient stages of learning only the first chapter or two can be used. This is definitely for more advanced speakers who can communicate fairly well and need that extra 'insiders' knowledge to boost them towards a native speakers level."
3,Japanese language secrets are hard to find,"After reading this book I found that Japanese language secrets are hard to discover, as a matter of fact nothing will help you if you don't study properly. This book can a little bit introduce you to some of the things they don't teach in ordinary textbook, and some of the things listed give the plenty of room to disagree."
1,Cheap tricks,"If you are interested in cheap tricks rather than substance, this is the book for you. There is no easy way to learn Japanese. There are easier ways, but no easy ways. Where is the beef? Not here."
2,Useful as a work of historical theology; lacks insight to contemporary Islam,"Wahhabi Islam by Natana DeLong-Bas is one of few comprehensive studies on Wahhabism written in English. The focus Abdul al-Wahhab's teachings is admirable, but leaves one with the feeling that Wahhabi Islam is about some notional classical Wahhabism with no bearing on the present day. Early in the book DeLong-Bas takes great pains to disassociate al-Wahhab from the well-known story that he and Muhhamed ibn Saud fused religion, politics and tribal violence to create a powerful political dynasty. If Wahhab was the unwilling rhetorical partner in Saudi expansionism, the co-option of his name and aspects of his teaching by the al-Saud is the more interesting and relevant story. DeLong-Bas makes no attempt to reconcile the Wahhabism of her her book, with the Wahhabism of contemporary Saudi Arabia."
5,A metaphysical classic.,"The late Max Freedom Long was a courageous and open-minded scholar of esoterica, and a recognized expert on Huna, the aboriginal spiritual tradition of Polynesia. In this book, he explains the truth of the teachings of Jesus, which have been obscured through centuries of false interpretations. By meticulously researching ancient texts, he correlates what he calls a code, used throughout ancient times to hide the deeper meanings of spiritual truth. This information casts a new light on the mysteries of Christianity and Judaism. An important work, and a good read, too."
4,How to pray more successfully,"If you want to pray in a manner that is more successful and always the best for all concerned, read this book."
5,LUSH GRAMMY-WINNING JAZZ,"Freddie Hubbard was one of the most prolific jazz trumpeters in the business. He played a hot and sassy horn! When he was teamed up with George Benson, Eric Gale, Herbie Hancock, and Ron Carter (just to name a few) on this one of many Creed Taylor-produced collaborations, he most deservedly won the Grammy!The opening title song ""First Light"" has an ethereal beginning with a diverse arrangement. An unusual arrangement of Paul McCartney's ""Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey"" is most satisfying. Henry Mancini's ""Moment To Moment"" has a hauntingly sweet sound. ""Lonely Town"" is darkly complex.There are many sides and moods to each of the songs within this original work. With stylish jazzy rhythms and rich orchestrations, this is THE Freddie Hubbard album to have!"
4,"It may be Freddie's favorite recording, but it's not his best","Freddie Hubbard has claimed this is his favorite recording, and it may very well be so, but it is far from his best work. It lacks the dexterity and freshness of his early work with Herbie Hancock (think Maiden Voyage, et al) and solo efforts such as Hubtones, and it lacks the raw originality and groove of his later (relatively speaking) recordings, such as Red Clay and Straight Life; that being said, I can see why the artist would be fond of this particular suite, for it's lush textures, beautiful melodies, and easy breezy feelings it's grooves produce, and also the great Freddie solos. It is a top-notch work, especially if one is a fan of the heavy production CTI engineers commonly used, and this recording is no exception. If adding strings to jazz conjures memories of long elevator rides or grocery store trips, stay away from this album. If solid arranging and soloing trumps a faint cheese smell for you, then buy away.Zach"
4,Deep wisdom to live by,"How often does a book speak to us in our rituals, our daily conversations with God, our history and our future. All of this is achieved in this beautiful book. Each story to be savored, reflected upon and then shared. I cannot tell you how powerful is the secret of these stories but they are yours to discover. May we all be inspired and inspire."
4,small but great,"even though the description clearly stated 4 inches, I was surprised as to how small is seemed when I received it...great detail though..."
3,perm rods,"arrived very quickly, i was impressed by that. but i after i used them the second time, some of the elastic bands snapped. but overall it is serving its purpose."
5,Masterpieces of Chinese Musical Drama,"Cyril Birch is the author of the superb translation of Tang Xianzu's magnificent ""The Peony Pavilion,"" contemporary with Shakespeare's plays and worthy of comparison with them, on the page thanks to Mr. Birch and on the stage thanks to the Lincoln Center Festival 1999. His introduction to Ming musical drama not only gives much background on ""Pavilion"" and its author, setting them in their historical and literary context, but whets the appetite to read and see the dramas he discusses by 5 other authors. Birch is not only a deeply knowledgeable scholar but an elegant and lively writer."
3,Urban Legend Comes to Life,"Growing up in Southeast Texas, near where this story takes place, we always heard about the haunting in Crosby. Local legend has it that this was the inspiration for ""Poltergeist"" but we brushed that rumor off as pure fiction. After reading this book I can absolutely see where those stories originated! The book reads more like a documentary, as the characters are a little bit cardboard-like, and the narrator feels far removed from the story. I didn't get any chills or feel any fright--but I did keep mentally screaming for the Williams family and their neighbors to vacate the premises immediately. What are you waiting for?!?!It's a true story, so keep a light on while you're reading this one."
3,Newport resident's view,"I live about 1 mile from where this story took place and from what I've heard the people that owned the house/wrote the book were having financial problems and desperately wanted to get rid of the house. When they found skeletons in the ground, this became their scapegoat. Anyways, that's the rumor, I'll have to try and see if I can find more out.Also, I personally knew the people who moved into the house after them and even went to a birthday party there, and they had no problems to speak of."
3,Practical advice,This is a book of practical answers to many of the questions people have about God and Jesus and life. The chapters are short. It is an encouraging book and will help people who have questions and don't know where to turn or might not know who to ask.
5,Great book from the great communicator,"Mother Angelica is truly a great communicator. I love the way she explains in simple terms how to bring God into everything. The examples she uses of her conversations with people are excellent!She's great, her EWTN show is great, and her message is the greatest thing of all---the Truth!"
5,Wonderful worker for EWTN,Mother Angelica is a Saint. Get into her thinking and you too can be a Saint.
5,Give This One Away,"Of the many hundreds of books I have read, only a few get on my ""Give This One Away"" list. It's my list of books I give to friends, relatives, and people I just meet who I feel could benefit from one of the books I prize. This book falls into my category of books which will help those in despair.Many people suffer differing levels of despair -- a giving up. For some, it's on their marriage, their job, or their friends. For some it is on life or happiness in general. For some it is on the Catholic Church, or God Himself. There are few books I find which can consistently ""speak"" to those in despair. On many levels, on many topics, Mother Angelica's book does the trick. Certainly it is the Holy Spirit working through her to touch hearts. Something I could never do on my own. So, for the people who enter my life and tell me of their despairs, I will give a copy of this book. Then we'll let God do the rest.It's the least I could do for Him, and for them."
5,EXELENT!!!!! LATIN WORLD BEAT BAND,"THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM OF THIS BAND THE ALUMB HAS A GOOD SONGS: EXELENT MUSIC AND EXELENT MUSIC THE PREFERENCE SONG: YO PUEDO IS AN EMOTIVE SKA, NO PUEDO (GREET HIT) EL DINERO NO ES TODO(EXELENT GREET HIT AFRICAN MERENGUE) BESANDOTE(SAMBA REGGAE SONG IS A GREET HIT) AND AMOR(IS A ROMANTIC SONG IN SLOW SOFT METAL)"
3,"Not bad Ewoks, but there's a newer one out",You can never have too many Ewoks. This Wicket and Logray is a bit old and there's since been a newer one in the 2010 Vintage line. It's a much better figure so I'd recommend getting that one. The paint job on that one is a whole lot better.
5,Awesome Book,I started playing golf 2 years ago and have spent a lot of money trying to learn from local pros and on other books. I bought John Redman's book and a couple of months later I spent a rainy Saturday reading this book and practicing in my den. You wouldn't believe how it change my swing. It is SIMPLE and PURE! Went to the range on the following Sunday and practiced John's techniques. I hit the ball straighter and longer than I ever have. Buy it and read it.
5,The swing for a lifetime!,"I've been struggling for years with back spasms due to the current modern day golf swing of building tension between the hips and shoulders to build so called ""torque"". If you read this book and look for the ""Azinger Way"" video on Amazon.com you will have a complete system of golf that will last you a lifetime with no pain or stress on your back or wrists (a common problem from laying the club off which many teachers teach because it's the flavor of the decade and supposedly reduces the difficulty of timing at the bottom of your swing arc). Buy this book, read it, watch the video (Azinger Way) and occasionally review these fundmantals on the video at the beginning of each golf season. What a small investment for some people who think you have to buy a 7 video set, a book, and more likely than not a golf training aid(s) to master a modern day method. Enjoy and give this swing some time and patience and you won't be sorry!"
3,Late 70's soft rock classic.......,"While only two songs justify buying the disk, its still worth the price. ""Baby come back"" gets quite a bit of airplay in most ""soft rock"" radio markets. I hadn't heard ""This time I'm in it for love"" for at least 15 years. What a great song. Junior high, first loves.....guaranteed to take you back."
2,"Only bought it for ""Baby Come Back""...","Those who may be wondering...the title track on this release is indeed the full-length version (the one that ends with the guitar solo). After years of purchasing cassette singles, and compilations with the shortened version...this release gave me what I wanted. So, if you don't mind paying the price for one song, then buy this CD. Otherwise...."
2,Handful of hits,"Player's big MOR hit ""Baby Come Back"" spent three weeks at the #1 position on the singles chart in the winter of 1978. It, and the band's handful of other hits are all here for anyone who still cares."
2,Missing,"I am no fan of these type of releases. Bring back the original Lp on Cd that featured ""Baby come back"". I want every song from that lp...not a couple of good tracks of this and a few from another lp..Music fans like the original recordings and all the tracks from the original LP. Player didn't have enough hits to have a best of cd...The ""baby come back"" original album is their best of, and should be brought back that way! This ""best of"" doesn't flow! Wake up record companies and start giving people what they want.. Unaltered original releases!"
2,"Well, ONE Great Song...","""This Time I'm In It For Love"" is one terrific tune, and you can get the full version here. It's worth it, if you love the song. If not...well, these guys get old really, really quickly."
3,6 hits out of 15 songs,"I love Player, but this CD has only 5 major hits on it: Baby Come Back, If Looks Could Kill, It Only Hurts When I Breathe, This Time I'm In It For Love, and Footprints in the Sand; and it has 1 minor hit on it: Beautiful Love. So there are 6 great songs out of 15 so-so songs. While I love this band, I would not buy this CD for 6 greats songs out of 15 songs, unfortunately."
4,checking them out,"they were kinda like a one hit wonder band but,however theire 2 hits were both dynamite..later..tony.."
5,Lived vicariously,"This was a great book! I don't ususally read ""biographies"" but I'm currently training my dogs to pull for fun and thought it would be an interesting read - it was! Now that I've ""read the iditarod"", I'm not feeling any need to actually do it. Congrats to the author for actually finishing."
4,"I'll Just Read About It, Thanks.",Of the Iditarod books I've read this has to rank as one of the best. Apparently a good sense of humor and a high appreciation of irony is a necessary component of being a Musher.
1,Music is cooking; sound quality is stone cold,"This is a great live album; my only complaint is the sound quality - I have played this disc on a decent system (dedicated CD transport, tube amps, and beyond-modest speakers), and find that instrument separation and sound stage are virtually NON-EXISTENT!! I have played tons of other Miles' albums on the same system and most of them sound great - especially the Columbia/Sony releases, remastered or not.I strongly recommend the ""Highlights from Plugged Nickel"" instead, unless you don't mind hearing the great(est) Jazz live performance using one ear."
3,eh.....,my opinion not what i thought it would be.you wanna hear great abstract Miles? Try his tribute to Jack Johnson
4,Ignore the 'Sad State...' review,"I personally loved this DVD... those expecting 5.1 surround and HDTV quality video need their heads examined!!! REMEMBER... this was a live ABC special from 1974! DVD's didn't even exist, much less VHS... so this is what we get. Be thankful that the master tapes even existed to produce this for the home market.I'm not sure I understand the ""Sad State..."" reviewer's intention. He has posted the same review (verbatim!) on each of the Sinatra Reprise concert DVD's, giving them each one star. The point of the rating system is to rate the DVD for what it is, not for what you believe the label should produce. Yes, it would be nice to get these all in a box set, but Amazon.com's review/rating system is NOT the place to express your opinion. Let the producer know!!!This is certainly not Sinatra's best performance, but it's not his worst either. I just love the fact that it even exists on DVD!!!"
5,Frank Sinatra-The Main Event,"This is probably Sinatra's best live performance on DVD. Recorded in 1974 it buzzes with excitement from his entrance down the aisle at Madison square Garden till the last moment. His selection during the concert was well balanced and his interaction with the crowd delightful. The only thing missing was ""New York, New York"" but he released it a tad too late for this airing-around 1979. Overall a great buy. One Sinatra fans will play over and over I feel sure."
1,Missing pieces,"The box this item came in looked like it had been poorly handled. Secondly, there was one extra stick but only one goaly stick. It was almost like the packing person was trying to make up for the fact there was no second goaly stick by putting in another regular stick. Very disappointing as this was a gift."
5,indoor hockey!,My grandson asked for this item. He really enjoys playing with it and its the right size for the family room too!
5,Great Buy! Fun for all!!,"Every time I go to my aunts house for a gathering, my little cousins who are significantly younger than I, convince me to play mini sticks. Being a big kid myself it doesn't take much convincing. After a number of years now the goals are pretty warn, but still standing strong after a lot of use. Lots of fun, well balanced goals, sturdy sticks, soft balls."
4,Great for the money!,"I bought this for my 3 year old for Christmas. He really enjoys it! For the money you really get a good amount of stuff. You have plenty of soft balls and enough sticks for a few kids. Two sticks are for lefties though. The balls are soft but stiff enough to use in the house. The sticks are a hard plastic, so u might want to keep an eye on the smaller kids! The nets are sufficient enough, but I would agree with other reviewers that they might easily break where they fold up. Other than that a great deal to introduce your kids to hockey and it all goes right into a carry bag!!"
3,Electronics: The Life Story of a Technology,"The book was complete and covered a great deal of inventions and improvements. However, it fell short I feel in not pointing out the really importent inventions & processes that really made a difference. Examples are the ""Planner"" process which made possible the intergrated circuit and ENIAC, the first electronic computer.F. A. Eckert"
4,DVD worth owning,"There is a lot to enjoy on this DVD. Though it is not sit-down ""critical viewing"" content, it still produces a party atmosphere for special occasions(or when you've had a rough day). I usually pop it on when I'm cleaning my home theater. It's definitely worth checking out!"
1,For a hundred bucks,Someone needs to list the videos 0n this or Im not paying that kind of cash geesh
2,Too basic,"The Gospel messages in these O.T. book commentaries are well presented, but the work lacks detail and explanation of the events described and foretold pertaining to the Prophets in or near his time."
1,Forgettable,"Another attempt to recapture the popularity of ""We Are The World"". Performed by various artists who do not even compliment each other. The proceeds from this single went to charity. I found it very forgettable and bought it because Olivia Newton-John sings in it."
5,Memorable!,"I read this book in its first release over twenty years ago. I lent my book out to many of my friends and eventually lost track of it. I just had to have another copy so I bought it once again. ""Unto the Fourth Generation"" was my introduction to Isaac Asimov and led to my love of his writing over the years. ""Look, You Think You've Got Troubles"" by Carol Carr is a humorous look at futuristic bigotry ... I think of it as a jewish Archie Bunker in space. All of these short stories are excellent and I look forward to re-reading each and every one of them.."
4,Wandering Stars,"I am not much of a fan of science fiction. I purchased it because it was a re-print from Jewish Lights Publishing. It had stories that had deeper truth. If you like science fiction, you will certianly enjoy this one. A read for me, but not a read again."
4,"Crisp, exact, and violent","This is a well-written western with 138 pages of detailed violence, enough to make you a little outraged if you are so inclined. Upon returning from the war, Union war captain Josiah Hedges becomes ""Edge"" after finding his brother brutally killed and left for the buzzards on their home in Iowa. He goes after the bad guys, in the process becoming a pretty darn bad guy himself. The book incorporates just the right amount of dry, subtle humor to add levity to an otherwise violent and gory panorama. Shortly after becoming appointed acting sheriff of Peaceville, Edge guns down two teens hell-bent on payback, afterwards replying, ""I think I just solved the town's juvenile crime problem."" The writing is good and the plot moves quickly from one scene to another, each equally violent."
2,Overabundance of unnecessary details of gore,"The main character, Edge, definitely doesn't have a compassionate bone in his body. Not only violence against the villians of the story, but females and juveniles as well."
5,A Negected Treasure,"This and her other book, Creative Sceptics, are both excellent. Perhaps because she is non assertive in the best sceptical tradition, perhaps because Popkin became the leading authority on scepticism, her works seem to be neglected.While it is true that she relies a good deal on secondary sources, her approach is wise and balanced, in the same manner as Basil Willey, and offers profound stimulus to creative thought."
5,Excellent quality children's music,This CD is a must have for classroom use. Your kids will never stop singing!
2,Poor Vocals,"I think this cd is one of the worst things I have even heard. It has poor, annoying vocals and my children scream and cry when they listen to it. I dont nkow if this is a side-effect but whenever my children hear these songs they start shaking uncotrollably. I think anyone who listens to this will find that it is badly put together and only children under 5 will enjoy it."
5,Warner Tool Products 174 Drywall Stripper,Good Tool for making those long narrow drywall strips. Scores both sides of the drywall at the same time. Works great and easy to adjust the width of your cut.
2,Maybe Chinese Drywall is Easier to Cut,"I've cut narrow strips no problem. No problem, except I have to measure with a tape everytime I change size because the built in rule cuts narrow. I have found anything bigger than 3 inch doesn't cut all the way through. I'm cutting 1/2 inch and have the wheels set all the way in. The u shaped piece of metal bends and I have to use a razor. It makes a nice straight line to cut along though. I guess I should have paid 3 times as much for the American stripper."
1,Value Destroyer,"Positioning the cutting wheels is an exercise in total frustration: need three hands. No indents for the three sizes, no secured bolts or nuts. Tightening the tiny bolts results in 'walking'. Loosen and try again. Finally, half way decent on 1/2"" - forget 5/8"" fire rated - found the end of the handle digs in to the drywall edge. The solution? Round off the edge! My solution: the garbage can. Result: cost of the tool plus 3 hours labor, down around $100."
3,Drywall edge cutter,"Good tool, a little cumbersome to adjust, but once done you can repeat the cuts easily. Great for those pieces around a window installation and to just trim off a sheet to length."
3,Good idea but,"Good idea and I got limited sucess out of it. It was hard to adjust and too a little getting use to. If you are going to buy this then buy one for each thhickness sheetrock you will use, that will make it worth it."
4,A human dimesion to a troubled time in Iran,"This book is a suberbly personal and true account of the life of a Nobel prizewinner, Shiin Ebadi. This reluctant heroine, whose actions are driven from her compassion for the women and children in Iran living around her, finds herself battling Iran's fundamentalist religious and sexist repressors. The focus on the author's own suffering, but on the enormity of the work that lies before her. She is a strategist, diplomat, advocate, loving mother and partner. Her persepctive on the wider stages of change in Iran, the awakening of democracy, gives valuable insights. This book is written in a style of dense brewity. Pages are packed with facts and information, not a word is wasted. A highly readable novel."
2,One Weird Limey,"This silly book is only for Kingsley Amis admirers. It tells of an articulate, obese, philandering English literary agent who when he isn't drunk, belligerent or lost, is strangely attractive to women. The obnoxious fatty is among East Coast academics whose own morals aren't much stronger but who are far more amiable. Colleges are given the names of popular beer labels (Budweiser, Schlitz, etc.) and the students are largely hostile to learning. Fun to read."
3,"Lavishly illustrated, but disappointingly flawed","Just like most books from DK Publishing, this book is lavishly illustrated, making it so much more interesting to read. Whereas why the Maldives is classified as a country ""in transition"" (1 of 9 such classified countries in this book, and the very last country described in the entire volume) is not clear and is debatable; there is absolutely no doubt that the editors need to pay extra attention in checking some basic world facts. Libya was mentioned by President Bush as one of the ""axis of evil"" countries? The Philippines were ruled, not once, but twice (apparently as recent as 1998), by communists? And the list of factual errors goes on and on. I would have rated this book way higher, but I was disappointed by such flaws."
3,One great season,"My rating is a mixed bag ... I'd rate the first season five stars and the subsequent seasons two stars or less.I think the first season was a great show -- better than ER ever dreamed of being. I also think the show jumped the shark after the first season when they got rid of Peter McNichol (who ran off to head Ally McBeal's law firm), Mandy Patinkin quit the show and they wrote Kim Griest out of the script.I would buy a DVD collection of the first season of Chicago Hope in an instant, but I wouldn't want seasons 2-6 if I was given them for free."
3,"GOOD, BUT ER IS BETTER","Chicago Hope was a good series, but it pales in comparisson to ER. ER is more accurate, less soapy (at least up until season 11) and is still one of TV's finest dramas. Chicago Hope was good, but not great. Disappointing for a David E. Kelley series.Nowhere near as good as his later hit, Boston Public. Damn FOX for canceling it!"
5,It's about time!,"I think this is one of the funniest and yet most touching tv shows I have ever seen. Mandy Patinkin is as charismatic as it gets and he even SINGS! I would love to own the dvd set, so RELEASE IT ALREADY!!!"
5,WHEN!,This was one of the BEST shows on television. What will it take to get it released on DVD? Come on studio!
5,I have first three seasons,"I love this show and have purchased the first three season from Amazon uk. JUST BEWARE YOU NEED A MULTI REGION DVD player to play in US, they were shipped to me in Australia, no hassles, season 4 comes out in march.......I don't understand why it is not available in USA, beening a US show, but the same can be said for Without a trace I have up to season 6, not availiable in US... Oh well THANKYOU AMAZON.CO.UK"
5,I need Chicago Hope every day!,They were re-running CH on the Health Channel but just stopped recently. I couldn't believe it. I am begging them to put it back on the air.
5,Waiting and waiting and waiting and.. waiting..,I have had this saved under my Amazon Wish List for a couple years now...and am waiting for that email to tell me it is available!!! This is my husband's favorite show of all time and I would love so much to surprise him with it. WHAT IS THE STUDIO WAITING FOR???!!?!
3,"Informative, but not very good reading","For gay men considering adoption or surrogacy (I am one), this book was extremely informative and useful. It provides a sense of the obstacles to expect and issues to think about during the journey to fatherhood, and for that I am grateful.However, as a book, it's merits do not extend much further. I found myself annoyed by the author's obsessiveness, almost to the point of mental illness, even though he is a psychologist himself. His partner's voice is completely absent -- it may have been a balancing factor. The story seemed to alternate between being a cold telling of the facts, and being over-emotional and personal.The letters written to Simon before he was born were a redeeming factor, and the happy ending made the book bearable, even though I thought I was never going to get there. (I guess that's how these two men felt, too, come to think of it.)"

5,Short workout for busy people,"I used this product for years in VHS and recently decided to get it in DVD. I am one of you who don't want to spend a lot of time and don't have a lot of time to exercise. This exercise program fits my needs perfectly. I following the part for upper body every other day and ab/back part everyday. My arms are firm and ab is flat. It's all I want. I don't do the part for lower body because I jog on treadmill every other day. The program is easy to follow at home. You don't need to have any fancy equipment except a few pairs of dumbbells, and a weightlifting bench if you have the space. 20 minutes for either upper body or lower body is not too much to ask. I have purchased VHS in the past as gifts to friends, and definitely recommend to anyone who would like to build up your muscle mass without spending a lot of money and time. The only drawback I have with this product is images on DVD is not as clear as on VHS."
4,Good DVD for older exercisers too--Kathy doesn't disappoint,"Good DVD, with some flexibility of what you want to do on a day. As one with 20 or so exercise DVDs who doesn't do communal gyms--this is one way to get what I need without having the competition of a gym."
2,Workout DVD,"In my opinion there is not enough time between each workout segment to easily transition into the next move, and I'm afraid the whole DVD is a little too ""over excited"" to be able to watch over and over again, once a week would probably be enough to bear which sort of defeats the whole object."
3,"No warm up, cool down",Was very disappointed when I found out that the routines did not include a warm up. I was hoping to use this dvd as a stand alone but now feel I have to do one of my others to make sure I am warmed up.
1,kathy smith lift weights to lose weight,sad to say the dvd would not play it was a bad dvd which would have been nice to have that work out but the dvd is trash....
2,Power supply not built to last,"As the other reviewers say, generally a fantastic case. I purchased five of these, however, and three of the five power supplies have died. The systems all received clean power via APC line conditioners. My guess is that my RAID-0 harddrive setups were a little too taxing for the power supply, but that's no excuse; these power supplies should be able to handle RAID-0. Since these PS failures occurred just after the warranty expired, Antec said they will not replace the power supplies (not even one) and is not responding to any of my follow-up inquiries.Phil"
5,Took care of my check engine light,"I had a check engine light that kept coming on . After obtaining the code , it was a choice between this solenoid , and the sensor that reads whether the solenoid is working . After researching online it was suggested to replace the sensor first , as the solenoid rarely went bad. So I did . Light came back on ! I then ordered this solenoid off of Amazon , and it fixed the problem ."
1,Wrong Part Dummies,"What you sent was a Fuel Vapor Purge VALVE...NOT a Cannister Purge Solenoid, two completely different parts!! You would think, considering you sell Auto Parts you would know the difference."
3,Its all in Spanish,"I was so excited to see a compilation of 18 of the Mina favorites from the 70's on a CD that didn't cost $50. Alas, for this CD she is singing in Spanish. For me anyway it just doesn't sound right; She is not cooing as sexily and it loses that "" sipping Campari on the yacht in Porto Fino harbor"" cool ."
3,More of an ornament than toy,"I love it, I really do, but it's not much of a toy. I didn't get it for a child or anything, I got it so I could put some sticky tape on the bottom and put him in my car as a decoration. Well he was a little smaller than I expected, so as a toy he probably wouldn't be much fun for kids unless they love corgis. In perfect condition, and I've dropped it a couple times and still no dents or scratches. If you like Corgis, this is a cute little addition to a collection."
2,Trite and disjointed,"Animation is as excellent as his other films, but the love story is trite with rather shallow protagonists (Howl and Sophie) and the war story is nonsensical and silly, where at the end of film now that Howl has been redeemed by Sophie's love the war is suddenly called off. I was disappointed by this film compared to Spirited Away, Nausicaa, and Totoro, where the stories are cohesive and the characters memorable and likable."
3,Review of FIRST KNITS,"This is a more complex book than I had hoped for. I have knit many items,but the layout and the directions were confusing.Also,the materials were not easily found,and they were very expensive.Anne Groben"
4,"An unexpected find. Unique, inventive and fun.","I was visiting Tower records years ago and came across this CD. Purely based on the fact that Tower Records had a recommendation for this disc I purchased it.This is a live album for this group (they still perform all over Europe but haven't produced a record in years) and it is an unexpected find. The music is a riff on many classic types of jazz and cabaret-style music. The singing is in French (mostly) so unless you 'parley vous Francais', you will be unable to understand what is being said. On the other hand, the music is live so you hear the crowd react (and they do) and you can kind of figure out that the lyrics are positive.At any rate, this is a very enjoyable disc that makes me happy to listen to on any occasion. As this is a two disc set, you get a wide variety of music to enjoy. I think if you like jazz you will enjoy this music."
3,O.K. but not on its own,"This book offers some insights into the language one would otherwise not be aware of. Those little thinhs one only knows by actually living within the country of the language. However, without the audio CDs or cassetts it is not worth studying. Learning to pronounce words incorrectly creates a speach base that then becomes difficult to overcome. I reccommend it...but get the audio that is offered with it."
3,"Good for begineers, focuses on the GLUT toolkit","Not too bad overall but perhaps focuses a little too much on the GLUT toolkit, rather than general OpenGL"
2,The Kids Like It!,"I bought this book thinking it was another book I saw on TV called ""The Ultimate Book of Kid Concoctions"". At first I was very dissapointed with the book because it didn't have the exciting secret toy store recipes like the book on TV, but after 3 weeks on our book shelf my kids have already made two projects and seem to be enjoying the book."
1,Don't Be Fooled!,"Don't be fooled. This book has a title very similar to The Ultimate Book of Kid Concocitons book I saw on PBS. I bought this book thinking it was the PBS book and was very upset. I'm sure I am not the only one making this mistake. The projects in this book are out dated and seem to be the same old things that have been around for years, Buyer beware! I would bet the publisher did this to trick people into buying there book."
2,nevershowed but good contact,This book never came but I was contacted first by the seller who thought my book had arrived. I was quickly issued a refund as they had no other copies. I appreciate their communication but I just wanted my book!
1,NOT THE PBS BOOK!!!,"Becareful, I read a review here that said that this is the book from PBS... It IS NOT. I bought the book after reading the review and just sent it back. It is not even by the same authors who wrote the PBS book. I agree with some of the other reviewers, this sounds like a scam job at the expense of children and their parents. I may have kept the book if I wasn't so upset about being deceived. If you are looking for the PBS book it is called ""The Ultimate Book of Kid Concoctions"" by John & Danita Thomas. I have sent an email to the authors about this rip off book, I hope they take some type of action."
3,Very average at best.,"I have not read the othe concoctions books people are talking about, but I did buy this one after seeing a woman on Living It Up with Ali & Jack. I could only remember the book had the name concoctions in it. My neighbor then informed me that I had purchased the wrong book. Oh well, I am not returning the book, but I am a little concerned that other people are making the same unfortunate mistake. In an age where money is hard to come by it is very sad that publishers would create look a like books wiht similar names. This book seems to benefit from the overwhelming success of the other series, I am sure that is not by mistake. In any event I will be purchasing the other books because that is what I was looking for. I looked over this book with by children and there was very little interest on their part, they only want to make the projects they saw on TV, which are NOT in this book. The book is a good concept, but is very average at best."
4,Nice Folks,"I met these authors at an education conference, and they are really genuinely nice people. I am an author of similar type activity books, so it was refreshing to share ideas and book plans in a friendly, open manner. Often authors are a bit secretive or possessive of their work, but these two were very open to sharing, which we did with big smiles. Again, refreshing! ... :o)"
2,Misplaced emphasis,"Albeit an interesting read, it fails to search the deeper nature as the author is caught in his own biases and prejudices [of which he seems strangely unaware]. He is correct in the location of information, but wrong in the placement of solutions and end results. Does education, as we see it today and perhaps since the appearance of radio, later television, and now computers and handhelds, need to change? Yes. In the way he imports? That would be foolhardy and is the mark of someone not addressing the deeper implications of technology on culture, behavior, and identity, let alone education which is directly related to these. Questions, thinking innovation, opening minds to possibilities, this is where education and schooling needs to head, away from standard prehistoric measures and check and balances."
3,Sailing Ships of New England,"Reading this book started me on the search for others like it. Recently, I read Sailing Ships of New England by George Francis Dow, another book about the history of boats in a specific region of the US. If you're interested in this sort of thing, I highly recommend it. It's full of great illustrations and makes for a great follow-up to Boating in the Adirondacks."
4,Very Versatile Brush,"Like all Regal products, very well made. I use this particular brush for Latin feels, as the wood handle sounds great as a cross stick clave' sound. For most other work, I prefer a heavier rubber coated model. Non- retractable means the bristles can become bent over time,but I keep mine in a plastic tube when not in use, but the positive side is they do not, and cannot, rattle. Only complaint is that the handles could be a little thicker,otherwise highly recommended."
4,Maximum Jazz!,This boxed set is one of the most complete sets of essential jazz that I have ever found. The quality of the recordings is excelent. Everything is just amazing.
5,Great for begining Jazz Musicians,"This CD is great for people who are strangers to jazz and just begin to learn it. In contains most of the basic standards, that every jazz musician should know, including many other ""Real Book"" standards. This CD would introduce you the greatest jazz musicians and greatest Jazz peices, and would give you a base to build on. A must!"
2,Skip This One,"This set is a throwback. First-rate leaders doing mostly good tunes, but in subpar sound, often dispensible performances, and with no discernable organization. As the sun sets on the compact disc (and EU copyrights expire) there are hundreds of superb jazz discs available at previously unheard of low prices, especially box sets. There is no longer any reason to waste shelf-space or head-space on this set, if ever there was."
5,Classic Christmas / holiday performances,"This set is a truly amazing find! Vintage 1950's and 1960's German performances of Christmas and traditional holiday music. This contains an awesome range of artists, from Maria Stader, Fritz Wunderlich and Herman Prey, Gundula Janowitz, Irmgard Seefried, to Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, with music ranging from excerpts from Handel's Messiah to traditional christmas carols. Instrumental and choral performances balance out the collection. Documentation is well-written, and the sound is excellent high-fidelity mono and stereo. Very recommendable!"
1,Mariano Merceron- La Epoca de Oro,"I wouldn't be bothered writing a review about this lilliputian compilation by BMG, except to say that it is beyond me why the folks at BMG keep re-issuing meaningless little compilations of the same recordings over and over again. I consider this an insult to Mariano Merceron's memory! Mariano Merceron was one of Cuba's leading composers and band leaders. At one time in 1952, he featured luminaries like Beny More, Pacho Alonso and Fernando Alvarez on vocals inhis gigantic jazz band, not to mention composer and pianist Juan Bruno Tarraza on piano! To shelve all those wonderful recorded treasures by Mariano & Guests and just re-issue this microscopic compilation is totally ridiculous and shows how much the present administration at BMG Latin knows and cares about the golden era of afro-cuban music!"
1,virtual makeover,"i got this product with no information and i can see it on my computer but it wont let me add any photos. i was getting it for fun, but it has only been frusterating."
1,garbage like most linksys routers,Don't buy this it is extremely weak and unreliable. That's my experience w/ most Linksys products.
5,AWESOME! FANTASTIC!,"The whole CD is wonderful! The music flows from one track to the next. ""She Wasn't with 'Em"" is the best. And for all you Daddies of little girls, ""The Years Just Fly"" is your song. I think that Carl is on the verge of great musical career. Keep the songs coming! Looking forward to the next CD. I already own this one as well as the first album, ""That Song."""
1,kattywatty,"What a piece of crappy writing. So chopped up, it boggles the mind. You read along...all of a sudden you think HUH...and go back to see if that is what you read. Often the same statements are repeated again and again. Not a well thought out piece of writing. No wonder it was cheap. Buyer beware!!!"
3,"Poor Characters, Good location","I live locally in Pacific Grove, where this story takes place. I hate to give a poor review of local writers but my sense of fair literary practice overrides any favoritism I might feel for locals. Either you have a good book, or you don't. This is not a very well written book. The characters are inconsistent in the beginning, their are HUGE gaps in the storyline (why did the woman with cancer up and commit suicide when there were no outward signs of severe depression?) and generally poor story development. That being said, the locations that the authors speak of are interesting (especially to those of us who know where they are) and that is what tended to shine through, not the characters themselves. Although I think some will find this book entertaining (especially those within the medical marijuana field and the elderly person who knows that life doesn't end at retirement)."
3,$0.99 special,"This collection of short stories is well written, the price is right, & Henry Kane is a fairly accomplished writer of fast paced noirish detective tales, & this collection is not an exception. But... this is one of my pet peeves- nowhere in the description does it state that it is a collection of short stories. While for $0.99 it is petty of me to complain I still think Amazon should ALWAYS include in the description that what you are purchasing is not a novel but a collection of short stories. While I'm at it, also included in ALL descriptions should be the number of pages because, even for $0.99, a ""novel"" of 110 pages is something the average reader may be disappointed with & I believe they would want to know this before deciding to make a purchase. I know I would."
1,This guide is a load of rubbish.,This has got to be the worst guide for Conkers Bad Fur Day.When you buy a great game you want a great guide too but thbis guide is abousoloutly [a let-down]...
4,Bag for Tripod,The bag is good for hauling your tripod around. It would be easier to carry if the two handles had a clasp.
5,best pants ever,these pants have 9 pockets and fit great. the adjustable waistband allows you to have a nice snug fit without a belt if you want. can even hold my xbox 360 gane cases in the thigh pockets... GREAT PRODUCT
1,Simple,I hate to trash a book but I agree with the other readers who found it uninteresting. There's far better books to read.
1,Disapointed,This purchase was a big mistake. I di not learn anything and this tape was of no use to me.
3,What about spiritual roots to disease?,"PLEASE read A MORE EXCELLENT WAY by Henry Wright. When we are sick and we dont know the reasons why - it can be quite frustrating. God does not want anyone to be sick - his desire is that we all live healthy and productive, Godly lives. There are roots to disease - and these roots are talked about all throught the Bible. Many people are now well that read A MORE EXCELLENT WAY - we now have something to work with. Remember - God's people perish for lack of knowledge. Thank you and God bless you."
1,very unhappy,"I expected to recieve a book, not a small pamphlet for $128.00. I had the great grace to have Msgr. Turro as an instructor in seminary and seek anything he has written; but not 24 pages for $128.00!! When contacting the seller, and Amazon to return it, I have not had any response. This is the first time I have ever had any problems returning anything with Amazon. I caution anyone using this seller."
3,"Like most things, it was fun while it lasted.","I have had these speakers for over four years, and they have been fine and sounded great. They can be very loud, and the wired remote for the volume is a plus. However, i must have rocked my speakers just a bit to hard, because one of the outputs on my amp/sub unit no longer functions. Kinda bizare, bacause now, i have a 3.1 system. So now, im saving my pennies for a brand new promedia 5.1 system."
4,Last Junior Year,"I read this book for the first time when still in grade school. I loved this book because I could relate with the horse subject that it contains. So many times the ""horsey"" books are written by authors who are not really familliar with how life really is in this strange horse show world that some of us live in. This book, although was in places very fictional, also had many realistic aspects to is as well as many true to life locations of horse shows as well as people. I hope to find a copy of this book for my daughter, because I am sure she will love it as much as I did."
1,I'm still lost...,Wanted more. Author didn't deliver. Second hand info and overt speculation are really all this book has to offer. Author holds himself in such a high regard that I thought the book was more about him and his visit to Brazil than any true crash investigation. Pass on this one. Not worth the time.
1,UFO Mishmash in Brazil,"The author is presented as a top flight scientific investigator,however, he does not conduct a scientific investigation. The book begins like a Chamber of Commerce pamphlet on rural Brazil. Finally we get to the ""crash"" investigation in earnest, but all the author does is run around Brazil listening to 2nd or 3rd hand stories from a local investigator. He manages to visit a few sights, but they present no valuable information so long after the ""events""sited in the text took place. He wastes so much time in fact, he finds that he has none left to actually seek out any first hand witnesses for an interview. His field research time has run out. He must return home after leading this reader on an unsatisfactory safari. This is a case unproven."
5,An interesting trip to Brazil,This book is a successful mixture of UFO Investigation and Travel Guide. Roger Leir and the witnesses have something important to tell. An exciting and entertaining story!
4,UFO IN BRAZIL,"UFO CRASH IN BRAZIL by Roger K. Leir is a book worth reading for anyone who has a interest in the subject of UFO's. The on-going investigation by Dr. Leir is somewhat of a travel-log mixed with interviews of alleged witnesses, and his own conclusions based on what he saw and felt when dealing with many of these people. I felt that Dr. Leir was too trusting at times, and took many statements he received as ""the truth and nothing but the truth.""However, from the book and updated information, it appears that ""something did in fact occur in Brazil."" The Brazilian government seems to have gone to great lengths to ""hide"" or, ""white-wash"" the entire incident.Dr. Leir made it quite clear that the conflicting information he received by various doctors and government officials only served to strengthen his conviction that a UFO crashed in a small town in Brazil, and the waves from that incident have not yet subsided!"
5,"Convict ship, Ireland to Botany Bay",For anyone who has ancestors caught up in the first Irish Rebellion and sentenced to Botany Bay. This is an excellent resource.
5,Mais um grande álbum de um grande grupo!,"O Grupo Niche tornou-se o meu predileto rapidamente. E no é à toa, pois esse grupo colombiano vem se superando a cada álbum, e no há um trabalho deles em que a alta qualidade no esteja presente. O maestro Jairo Varela e seus ótimos músicos fazem do Niche o melhor grupo de salsa!Em ""Imaginación"" há 8 músicas de primeira. Com novo cantor: Oswaldo Roman.Todo o álbum é sensacional, mas vou arriscar uns destaques:""Culebra"", ""Ni como amiga ni como amante"", ""La biselada"", ""Vamos a ver""."
3,Quanah Parker & The Comanche Indians,"I had hoped this video would contain sufficient information to pique interest in the subject with friends I would show it to. In this hope I was deeply disappointed. It was entirely too brief and omitted many important details. I would not pass it along. In my estimation, Quanah was one of the giants of the American West, and may he one day receive his due, but not here."
5,top #3 trance songs of all time,"Yes, Im goin out on the limb here. This is the top three in the trance category, argubably #1. Tiesto and Corsten nailed it here. Everytime i listen to it, no matter how I am feeling, this song seems to put me in a good mood. The most euphoric in its class. Get this song or an album on it"
3,"OK, it's a bit academic, but I found it helpful.","Speaking as a layman who had practically no knowledge of e-commerce I found the book to be a good introduction to the world of electronic money and of what the future of money will probably be (Personally, I don't like what I see). Along with the history of money, and the development of the Internet, the book contains a lot of detail on the nuts and bolts of the whole complex network; and I don't know how interesting that is to the average person. I read this book not for pleasure, but as research for a paper I am now composing on a related issue. Regarding the topic of virtual money, the author seems to discuss the problems and risks surrounding it rather than give concrete solutions. But neither the publisher nor the author described the work as an ""answer book"". From what I can see, the write up on the book's dust jacket is an accurate summary of what the book contains."
3,3,"Limited, 180 Gram Audiphile Rare Mono Edition, pressed at RTI on Premium HQ-180 Vinyl. I have comments on the technical side. The fourth song is heard repeating crash. Cover without individual numbers!!! Just a shame."
5,A Classic!,This Disc is a Classic.The Chemistry Of Miles&GIl Evans is pure magic.The Arrangements&The Group were very tight all the way on this set.I Love The Duke.Very Classy as is the case with this disc.
1,Great Music LOUSY sound,"The tape hiss is SO loud on this issue that it nearly obscures the brushes of the drum kit. And the horns are terribly brassy and unnatural, ""screaching"" comes to mind.It's great music but this CD is a techical mess."
4,So good it made me crazy to travel to India,"This is a wonderful, compelling book about Indian culture. It's almost like a travel guide for the educated person. Religion, curiosities, lore, personal experience, it's all there. Great for beginners like me who have an immense curiosity about India but never visited the country. It's organized as a dictionary, so you can read it as the mood strikes or jumping back and forth. I read it in the Portuguese translation, pretty OK, can't say a word about the Spanish translation. I also read Jean-Claude's Carriere adaptation of the Mahabharata and enjoyed tremendously. He also was the script-writer of some of Bunuel's films, what a talented man."
2,Live in London -- Dead on Arrival,"There are hints of the stylishness that has earned A. M. her reputation, and perhaps the audience for this live recording had a considerably different experience than I. But I can't join the applause for this performance, characterized by approximation of pitch (under and sometimes more under) and short-breathed phrases."
5,Awesome Grip!!,"This is such an awesome grip. It made my 15 years old Ruger P89 looks brand new! Not only it looks great, but it fits great. It also feels better shooting my P89 for sure. I highly recommend this grip on your Ruger P series."
4,"Good quality, but not for me","Good quality hand grip from Hogue, but I found it to be to thick for my liking on my Ruger P90 and I didn't feel my fingers lined up well with it."
5,Best $20 you can spend on your gun!,"I'm very impressed with my Hogue Grips for my old Ruger P85. These grips were a breeze to put on, took me all of 2 minutes. The grips are well made and fit the P85 perfectly. This is the BEST $20 I have ever spent on a gun. I would highly recommend purchasing these grips if your looking to upgrade the looks and functionality of your Ruger P85 pistol."
4,Good Improvement Over Stock Grips,This grip is a great improvement over the stock hard plastic grips. It has a tackier feel which gives a firmer grip and also has formed finger grooves. The grooves give you a firmer and more relaxed grip when firing.Not sure how it will last over time if you do a lot of shooting with your pistol. Time will tell how cleaning solvent and oil effects it also since it is a softer rubber material.The grip fit very well on my Ruger P 89. Matched up perfectly and required no alterations.
2,Not comfortable after 10 minutes riding.,"I tried the ISM Sport Saddle, which appears to be a slightly narrower version of the Touring Saddle. I found that the two short forward-facing horns of this seat dug into the underside of my thighs. If they had designed these horns to be a little narrower or closer together it would probably been fine. As it was the seat was uncomfortable, so I returned it.This seat might have worked better with a larger person with more area between their legs, but I have a smaller build at 5'-11"" and 145 lbs.After trying a few more ""safe"" seats I bought the EasySeat with Adjustable pads (also offered by BikeWorld USA). I've used it for two years and wouldn't go back to any other seat now."
2,It was not what i expected!!!,"THE BOOK ""MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE"" WRITTEN BY JENNY K. WAS AS MANY PEOPLE WROTE IN THEIR REVIEWS, ""AN INSULT TO HUMAN INTELLIGENCE,""BUT THE ONE WRITTEN BY NICHOLAS SPARKS HAPPENS TO HAVE A DIFFERENT TOUCH TO IT, MAKING READERS ALL OVER THE WORLD SAVOR THE STORY. I HAVE READ ""MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE"" BY SPARKS ABOUT 6 TIMES BECAUSE I LOVED IT THE FIRST TIME AND HAD ME CRAVING FOR IT 5 MORE TIMES. BUT LETS BE NICE AND AT LEAST GIVE JENNY K THE CREDIT FOR WRITING IT..."
2,"tear-jerker, but poorly writen","The story line is like a fairy tale, which we all wish could happen to us. You get into the love which develops between the characters, but it is very poorly written. To meet your desires, your imagination is very much needed."
1,I'd rather sleep,than read this book again. This is one person that should go to Vo Tech if you know what I mean. The book seems to sleepwalk through most parts. They made a movie about this nightmare?
1,There's so much more worthy of your time...,"Both the story line and the writing did not meet my expectations. Both were weak. My local library included it on its list of ""good reads"" and I find myself wondering why."
1,One Star is Too Many!,"It is my pleasure to write the first non-author review of this novel, and I use the term novel rather loosely. This book was possibly the worst written fiction book about snipers or Vietnam I have ever read. It is poorly written, there are many typographical errors, the main characters are unlikeable and poorly developed, and the non-existant plot is unbelievable. Potential readers would be better served by reading Charles Hederson's ""One Shot, One Kill"", for a non-fiction account of Marine Sniper, Carlos Hathcock. Do not waste your money on this book, I wish I hadn't."
2,Nothing New here,"Seems like the message of this documentary could be delivered in 10 minutes. Every thing needs to be made into an 1.5 hours, just get to the point."
2,Pretentious,"Interesting film, with some nice focal characters, but comes off as pretentious and ignores some big systemic issues preventing the type of agriculture they describe from becoming widespread (e.g., the cost of food for ordinary people, food deserts in urban areas, lack of culinary training, etc.)."
4,Eye-opening,A head's up to the importance of smaller family farms vrs corporate farming. Mother Earth would be proud of this documentary!
4,just love of food and community,That's what makes this documentary a good one. There are plenty of ways to criticize the current system but this movie focuses on the what we CAN and are doing to make the US good system a better one.
5,Can HANK Save Rock ?,"Can HANK save Rock music? Probably not. In a world that loves boy bands, and drum machines and crappy music, one wonders if HANK an unknown band from Massachusetts, that has their music in the hit TV show on NBC ""ED"" can save Rock music. I heard their stuff watching the show a few weeks ago and started my mission to find out more about these middle aged rockers. Come to find out they released a CD last June on a tiny label out of Houston ,Texas called Momentum Records, the title of the CD ""The Power & Beauty"" and man... I'll tell you, HANK made me want to listen to Rock music again. Not since Tom Petty's early days have I been so inspired to want to listen to something other than The Beatles or The Stones. These guys Rock! If you are a jaded middle aged person that has gives up on Rock music, do yourself a favor and buy HANK's Power % Beauty CD. - Gary Wood"
5,Colin's Library Essentials of Sociology,I am very happy with the condition of the book and how quickly the book was shipped! I would recommend this to anyone. Thank You.
4,Great Seller!!,"I bought this product without reading the caption that stated it wasn't the actual book, but rather the pages inside of a binder. However, the seller made sure I got it by the time I started class. That was the most important thing. The seller also included a binder, at no extra cost, which was great. But, the pages didn't fit very well and I couldn't turn them easily. I had to go out and purchase another binder that could hold the pages more easily. Other than that, I was very satisfied. I would totally purchase from this seller again! Two thumbs up!!"
4,Good communication on seller's part...,I received the book later than expected but when I emailed the seller about it. She immediately responded and shipped the book right away.
1,No Book,"what book? they never sent it! I ended up having to go to the sote to buy it,so I could catch up in class. YET, I did recieve a very prompt refund"
3,Okay but written at a high school level,"The book is okay but it is not very well written. Henslin seem to be writing down because this text is only written at a 10th grade level, as tested by a SMOG readability test. It covers the basics in Sociology but at a very elementary level. However, it does seem that some fields of academia are now using ""dumbed down"" texts."
3,Service was great; book is just OK,"The book is reflexively liberal. The author's first person accounts of his worldwide travels, frequently to the most wretched places on Earth, were interesting.The book, which is a college text, is written at an 8th grade level."
2,Something to read when you have nothing else to do,"I got about halfway through this and had to prod myself a little each time to open it up. Finally I decided to give up and start a new book. Nothing really pops in this story. Bachelor doesn't have time for needy women, finds non-needy woman who has other plans, they hang out but don't acknowledge they are interested in each other. That goes on for a while and I never got past that point."
2,I really struggled with the heroine,"I finished this book yesterday and even after a day I'm still irritated by the h's attitude. Again considering the time period, I found the h's attitude very 21st century. We are told constantly how 'different' her family is and how her mother just wants her to have a love match. I sincerely doubt that any parent of the day would have gone to such trouble to get their daughter alone with a young, handsome and eligible male.Inevitably the h sleeps with the H but refuses to marry him. Of course the thought of pregnancy never enters her mind (although later it does). The fact that she continually doubted the H's love for her, and he professed it quickly, and if I were him I would have found someone more deserving.I bought the trilogy, which I've put aside for now because I was so put off by Violet. I do like the author though and enjoyed The Temptation trilogy so I'll probably pick up the second book at a later date."
3,Different LOve Story,This book was a quick read with a little bit of sex and a lot of family interferance. Cute and without substance.
4,A clever historic -romance,This is a clever way to bring history and romance together. The people seem to be very human. It has some amusing moments in it too.
3,good read,"I like this book. I thought the two characters had real chemistry. The only problem is the plot is a little messy. Some of the plot turns seemed totally impossible, but the in the end the book is saved by the relationship between the two. I have read the other two books in the series (rose and lilly) and found them lacking. I think Violet is the best one."
3,???,"I am not to sure about this movie I haven't finished it yet. I am kinda lost. I like Danny Trejo and GaryDaniels, but this is just plain strange."
4,Great Book! Awful Kids and Parents!,"I vastly enjoyed this book and thought Mr. Bledsoe did a marvelous job of reporting this horrible crime. What a bunch of sick kids! And the parents - gave the children everything but morality and a sense of responsibility. One mother just ups and abandons the entire family 'cause she had to be alone to ""think"" (i.e. or move into an apartment with another man.) Each and everyone dropped the parenting ball big time. Christopher's mother really amazes me. To think that she dotes on the ""child"" responsible for arranging to have her entire family wiped out so he can get some cash. She should be a sympathetic character but to me she just comes across as over-indulgent and insipid. Hello! Your son wanted to kill you, your husband and your daughter! What are you thinking? What were they ALL thinking?"
1,NEVER EVER SAW OR READ OR ORDERED THIS BOOK,"REALLY I AM GOING TO WRITE ABOOK REVIEW ABOUT A BOOK THAT I NEVER READ.FIRST OF THE TITLE IS DISGUSTING. PEOPLE THAT FIXAE ON BLOOD ARE GENERALLY PATHOLOGICAL MISCREANTS WHOWERE PROBABLY VICTAMIZED AS CHILDREN. THAT SEGWAYS INTO ""GAMES"" THE SECOND WORD IN THE TITLE , WHICH SEEMS INDICATIVE OF A LACK OF MATURATION ON THE AUTHORS/EDITORS/PUBLISHERS PART.THIS STUNTED CONDITION IS LIKELY CAUSED BY AN ADOLESCENT INCIDENT IN ACLOSED GARAGE WITH OLDER BOYS.AS FOR THE FRONT COVER ART WHAT CAN I SAY? IT ISCLEARLY DESIGNED TO INDUCE THE MOST DAMAGED INDIVIDUALS IN OUR SOCIETY TO FORGO THEIR HALODIL PRESCRIPTION AND INSTEAD PURCHASE THIS BOOK. OK HOW DID I DO?"
5,Wonderful Book,This book has a good amount of clinical information. I have found it to be very useful and informative. This book is one that I will use as I become more skilled and knowledgable. It is a must have for someone interested in Chinese Herbalism!
1,Lamplight 52664 Farmers Lantern,This lamp really was not what I thought it was suppose to be.It has to use oil. I wanted battery.
2,Typical Chinese quality,"Made in China, of course. Okay for cheap use on patios for a party, but for a real emergency lantern, you're way better off going to an antique store and getting a real, solid old steel American or German hurricane lantern. This only cosmetically looks like them...I'm not even sure it's a real cold blast lantern, I don't think the side tubes are actually functional."
1,I didn't like it,"The material is printed, it is not a real costume. My 3 yrs son loves it, but i think you can get something better for that amount of money."
3,"My Son loved it, but it was flimsy.","He really enjoyed being Obi Won for Halloween, but I thought the material was a bit flimsy for the money I paid."
4,Great Sync for Outlook,"i'm using DTG v2.506 which is the newest version as of 8/00. i'mcurrently using this to sync with Outlook 2000 (under Win98 for bothwork and home) and find it an invaluable tool. it installs easily andworks smoothly with Outlook -- i'm running Palm Desktop 3.0.1, Hotsync3.0.4, Palm V with OS 3.3 and have no problems yet.i really enjoyedthe options for syncing things like date book, address book, and to dolist within a specific time span (i.e., sync all tasks 60 prior and 90days forward from the date of the sync). the to do list will alsoallow you to only import to the Palm those items still open, therebyleaving the completed tasks on your desktop as archive.thereisn't much of a manual here but it is an intuitive process. as withany new software, be sure to back up your data before preceeding andbe attentive to the initial sync."
2,Esoteric Academic,"This book in incredibly dense, a little mythical, and dry, dry, dry. That said, there are flashes of wisdom that I found helpful."
4,David A. Magnusson,"I gave the album, 4 stars. But like a fine wine or a painting, if I re- review this album again next year, it will move up to five stars, I am sure. The songs are very good. The first song really grabs hold of you. it may be the albums best. But, you hate to have your lead off hitter, your best hitter. Perhaps the song should have been snuggled deeper within the album. Ther lyrics are as good as I can remember as is Al's voice. Thanksfully, not everything revolved around wine or some other common theme. As I keep listening to the tunes, I get more andmore hypnotized by this man's genius. HEY AL, WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK TO MIAMI?!"
2,Very very disappointing,"Al Stewart is my favorite singer/songwriter , I hate to trash his new album -- but its a very disappointing release from one of the best song writers... ever . This album is strictly for die hard fans and audiophiles. It's pretty much the same in style as Down In The Cellar. The recording itself is impeccable , but the songs are flat out boring and all but three or four lack any hint of melody - theyre sorta flat . The Immelman ,Rainbarrel and Gina In The Kings Road are'nt terrible but would be filler on most Al Stewart lps. The only standout is Katherine of Oregon - ( a short acoustic thing ) , the other songs are so mediocre i cant still cant believe theyre part of an Al Stewart album -- then again youre allowed to lay an egg once every 35 years"
5,Fantastic!!!,"I last heard Al back in the 70's. Year of the Cat, Time Passages, On the Border. They were on our radio over and over. Then, he was gone! And I forgot about him. Last week, I saw him perform live at a small guitar store in Santa Monica, California. MY GOD, the man is a musical genius!! Radio stations are MAD for having forgotten or snubbed this man!! He sounds EXACTLY the same as he did 35 years ago! His music is nothing short of genius, his lyrics, politically savvy or just plain lush. The musical pictures he paints are Picasso's and Van Gogh's -- classic and yet modern. If you've never heard of him, BUY THIS ALBUM! If you thought you knew Al Stewart, BUY THIS ALBUM!! You will LOVE it!!"
5,Return of Al Stewart,"This album is wonderful from start to finish. Excellent songs and great musicianship with beautiful guitar work. His voice is in top form. Amazing imagery through his unique lyrics. Put the headphones on and really enjoy, this is a classic !!"
4,Like Walking Along a Beach and Finding a Treasure,"His best in many years! His music 'rocks' again in ""A Beach Full of Shells"" in a way that he hasn't in recent years. Musically, he nails this one, with songs and tunes that stay with you. Great to have you back Al!"
4,One Song is More Than Worth It,"I have been an Al Stewart fan for over 30 years and there is no one that can match his songwriting. There is a way that Al Stewart can write an entire ""book"" with the few words allowed in a song, and imbue you with a sense of personal significance in those words - that the story of people that have gone before also reside within us, albeit perhaps most of us are not as historically ""important"". While I was not overwhelmed with all the tracks on this CD (I tend to be spoiled with his years with Peter White), the genius of Al Stewart comes out in the one song, ""Somewhere in England 1915"" . . . . The other tracks are very nice but for nothing else, bye it for that one track."
2,Trying hard to like this one,"I am a long-time Al Stewart fan, and have seen him in concert many times. I have most of his CD's (except for some of his earliest works), but I have to say that""Beach Full of Shells"" is my least favorite. With the exception of a few songs, I am having a tough time liking this one. The music is OK, but some of the lyrics are so obscure that I feel ""left out"" by Al's story-telling. At least with his previous CD's I know what he's referring to. (Who the heck are Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon?)Musically this CD is inconsistent. Some of the songs leave you with a melody that stays around (""Immelman Turn"" and ""Gina in the King's Road) but others like ""Beacon Street"" and ""Anniversary"" are quite forgettable and just left me uninspired. I hear that Al is supposed to be releasing a new CD in early '08 with Laurence Juber. I always look forward to new material from Al, and hope this one coming up is better than ""Beach""."
5,Picture Perfect,"Al Stewart is a master of songcraft like no other. For all of something like 45 years he has been painting portraits, landscapes, and historical scenes in impeccable English prose set to the most exquisite music. This album is no exception. But it is in fact an article of exceptional artistic quality. I have all of Al's albums and love each one of them. I would hazard to say this is my favorite of the lot. It is a polychromatic effort that comes off effortlessly. Everything just works seamlessly, beautifully. As the master himself has said ""if it doesn't come naturally, leave it"". A Beach Full of Shells is a perfect natural and a piece of work you most definitely don't want to leave unexamined."
1,This is horrible!,This is the worst mess I have ever seen. How can anyone put 3 to 4 storylines in a half hour film? There is nothing redeeming or edifying about this movie. What Would Jesus Do? Not watch this movie.
1,A Waste,"Track selection is terrible. None of the tracks were mixed in properly. CD 1: Probably the worst I've heard in awhile. Too cheesy. CD 2: Sean Quinn used a lot of old tracks, which I didn't expect from title: Summer Annual 2000. The tracks were okay towards the end, but the mixes were off beat and not hype at all. Overall my suggestion for all house and trance listeners..........wait for Gatecrasher's next set. It's always a safe bet."
4,worked like it should,I installed with no issues. This is the 32 bit version only. Make sure this is what you want.
1,Don't try this at home!,I purchased this to upgrade from Windows Vista Home Premium to Windows Vista Ultimate so that I could run Virtual PC 2007. The first time I tried the upgrade it failed (after about 3hours) with a non-specific error: Windows was unable to upgrade a component or components. I tried it again with the help of Microsoft phone support. The second time it also failed but it also took out my hard disk so that I had to restore it from my latest backup. This product is still in the alpha stage. Don't buy it unless you have at least 8 hours to play around with it. It is not a stable product.
3,Pink Highlighter,"This is an absolutely phenomenal book. I wasn't notified that it would be liberally marked up with pink highlighter, otherwise I might have bought another used copy. But nothing can get in the way of this book being inspiring and incredible. Every gay man must read it."
5,"yeah.......s'ok. ""Smiles"" on digital empire CD is better","yeah, I'll have to agree with Bart. the only reason i got this album was beacause on the Digital Empire album i fell instantly in love with ""Smiles"" unfortuneatly no track on Breulken Heightz comes close to Smiles, though the tracks do grow on you. I, as well, would recommend the same tracks Bart suggested. Sub Scapes is Good Techno. By the way Joey Jupiter is one of the two Djs that makes up AB. you may want to check his single stuff out too. in concluson you may just want to get this only if you are a diehard atomic babies fan or if you just love techno in general."
4,A Fairly Good CD,"The first couple times I listened to this I couldn't stand it but the 3rd time it really clicked and I have to say this is a pretty good CD. It's got some funky 6-minute tracks that make for a good listen. My picks are tracks 3, 5, 6, 9, and 11... 1 & 2 are okay too."
1,Put me to sleep,"This CD isn't even acceptable as background music because it doesn't produce a background. It's crap and it puts me to sleep when I listen to it because there's really nothing there. When you listen to other dance CD's that are held together by a single beat and you wish for some diversity, well this has that, but it doesn't even interesting music otherwise. This is considered rave music, only kids who are on drugs and looking at bright flashing lights could possibly find this music remotely passable."
2,Weak ending.,"This is, overall, a fair to middling Star Trek story; the action is good, the characterizations are better than average, the plot fair if not terribly original. The problem is, it is mostly spoiled by a rather wishy-washy, unsatisfying ending. Since I can't say much more about the ending than that without giving away major plot points, suffice it to say that I found both the climactic point AND the post-climax epilogue to be very implausible and to be a cheap out for the major focus of the story."
2,Sadly predictable,"I was quite disappointed with this book, as most of Dillard's other Star Trek novels have been excellent. This one was sadly predictable; neither the dialogue nor the narrative sustained my interest for long. I gave it two stars because she does some good work with a few of the characters, but overall, this is not a book I can recommend."
4,Good Enterprise Spirit!,"Surak's Soul I think stuck to the spirit and feel of the Enterprise show. While it could be more accurately named, Wanderer, I think it is a good idea for anyone looking for Enterprise material to read.Wanderer -- I suggested this title because the whole plot of the book revolves around a character of this name -- I won't reveal and major plot points but I take it you've read the summary? So T'Pol kills a alien and feels guilty -- the truth is, little of the plotline deals with her internal guilt over this act. So if you are expecting to recieve a deeply rooted story exploring T'Pol dealing with guilt over murder than don't expect this.Surak's Soul is a good book but really deals little with T'Pol's guilt -- her guilt plays a part but not as much as I had expected. Surak's Soul has Hoshi as one of its key focuses, so, if you are like me -- a Hoshi fan, than this is an very good book and deals more with Hoshi and T'Pol than previous Enterprise books."
4,A Decent Read,"This is a decent novel. It's like an above average TV episode. Recommended if you want a quick, entertaining read."
2,Boring novel,"This book was really dull, in my opinion, like many of the Enterprise episodes that have aired thus far. The only unique hook is T'Pol referencing Gandhi's stance on non-violence. Other than that, this book is a slim adventure typical of many of the troubled episodes we've seen on TV the last two years. This one's strictly for the completists."
1,"Save your money, folks! It's not too late!","This book deserves a zero. Unfortunately, there is no rating that low, so I am forced to give it a one.Suffice it to say I've read fanfiction that was less contrvied and boring. It barely has anything to do with T'Pol at all. She just has ONE meditation about the issue at hand, and says ""OK, let me give up using violence in any form because it's always wrong."" And we get to see nothing else about it until about page 205 (near the end of the book).And the whole Alien Mystery thing wasn't that great either. I figured out quickly whodunnit.If you do want to still buy it, don't order it. Borrow it from your library or at the very most buy it from your local bookstore. It's not worth paying the shipping and handling fees."
2,DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS XP - BEWARE,I just upgraded to Windows XP after buying this product. It's not supported by Microsoft. Neither is the Astra 6450.Be very careful.
1,WARNING: NO SUPPORT FOR OS X,"I bought the 6450 (same as this with transparency adapter) a year or so ago and it worked well enough under Mac OS 9.1. However, when I upgraded my Mac to OS X I was astonished to find out that Umax does not support this series of scanners under OS X and has no intention of doing so. That leaves recent purchases of the scanner high and dry. I am totally fed up with Umax and will never buy anything from them again."
2,Why should I pay $49 to have a CD SHIPPED to me?,"I am high and dry with this scanner and no software. Yes you can PURCHASE the new software for OS10, but it's not available for DOWNLOAD. You have to wait for them to ship it. Can someone please explain to me why you can't download it like virtually every other piece of software in the universe?"
2,Worked fine at first...,"Well, I bought this scanner almost a year ago. It worked pretty well for a while. It is quite fast, and I like the way the TWAIN software retains modified settings until one changes them: a feature more manufacturers should consider. BUT, not only did it not work with XP (what were they thinking???) when I upgraded, it wouldn't work with 98 SE when I tried to re-install it on my old machine. Looks like the card is bad. Very disappointing performance."
1,NO!!,"The horrible effects make it unwatchabe!! When the killer rats attack their victims its laughable how anyone would allow these effects to fly.. I mean this CGI goes down as the worse in movie history to date!! I laughed, I took the dvd out and laughed again!!!"
2,Interesting if decent,"Rented the movie and it's a interesting movie but it was good and not good at the same time. Some parts seemed like it could be better even for a 'B' movie. Though one of the things that bothered me was that some of the rats seemed to be done with cheap CG and didn't seem to all that great like with other movies that use CG for live action. The acting on the other hand wasn't that bad but I think it could have been better and the writing seemed a bit weak. Although with the audio it seemed like that it was a on a bit of a low side cause I had to try to figure out what sound on the TV to have it on and turning it up a bit to hear. As for a horror movie, it don't stack up well with the other horror movies out there and the gore seems to be up there a bit even for a TV movie. Overall I give Killer Rats 2.5 stars out of 5."
4,revenge of the rats,"didn't expect much when watching this movie and it turned out to be really good, a great low budget movie! there's so many bad creature movies out there now days but this one definitely sticks out among the crowd. body count is plenty high with plenty of blood and guts and the giant rat is pretty cool. plenty of non stop action and the acting is all well done. have to recommend this film for the fans of the nature amok category for sure, check her out"
1,Just Couldn't get past the awful CGI,"I'm sorry, but I really couldn't get past the awful CGI. I've seen A LOT of bad CGI movies, but in this particular film, it makes it laughable if not almost unwatchable. I am a big fan of Ron Pearlman and he is the main reason I purchased this movie, but not even he could save this one."
3,Way Too many Rats.!,"The storie about an abandon experiment on rats that have overgrown is very good,.the execution in the case of this movie is not quite good,.the CG effect of the rats is too fake looking, I'm sure some rats were actually real,. the rehab place is full with young people who will have scary and bloody encounters with the oversized rats,.An insane janitor is the rats protector,..acting is good,.too bad sexiness didn't compensate for the bad especial effects,.my favorite rats movie is still ""Grave Yard Shift"",.But Killer Rats is not the worst out there."
1,"an outdated chart, I regreted to order.","Among the 10+ cross stitch books I owned, this Anne Orr's charted designs is the worst printed one. The papers are yellowish, the print is black and white. Overall, this book cannot attract or arouse my interest on starting any project. I regreted to order."
3,"Nice Biber sonatas, nicely played, nothing more.","These are not Biber's best works. I find his Mystery sonatas and some of his vocal works a lot more appealing. Manfredo Kraemer's Rare Fruits Council are fine performers but they seem a bit tired of the pieces themselves. Yet some of the sonatas (4 and 10) are played better than others, with more spirit. The sound in the recording is very nice and puts the trumpets in front, backed by the embracing organ sound of Alessandro de Marchi. Good for compulsive collectors of mid-Baroque."
4,Great jazzy stuff,"Clementine has a nice breezy voice that sort of goes against the grain of the material, but in a nice way. Recommended"
4,Superheroes made human,"Frank Fradella is a great author, and 'Swan Song' shows once again why this is so.Superheroes are all through our cultural heritage, especially in comic books, but it takes a particularly talented writer to not only introduce us to new heroes in novel form, but also to show that super-powers aren't necessary to make a super-hero. That the real heroism is in attitude, and determination, and making the most of the abilities you have.If you're a superhero fan, this is a must-read. And if you're NOT a superhero fan, this is still a must-read - it'll give you insight and compassion for those heroes who works so hard to keep our society safe and strong."
2,Billet Specialties 55520,"I installed this on my T-Bucket. I discovered that the two wires which enter the license plate frame are located in such a manner that they will be pinched between the frame and the plate. This is a potential for a possible short of one or both of those wires after a period of time. I trimmed a notch into the edge of the license plate so that the wires would not be sandwiched between it and the frame.The red lens for the 3rd brake light is of poor quality, consisting of a flat piece of red colored plastic, that appears pink at the location of the bulb directly behind the lens."
3,Good But Not Great,"This is Dokken's 2nd live release. While it is good to hear them still doing live albums, this one just sounds a bit off. I do not fault the musicianship nor the quality of the material. The review below has G. Lynch performing on this album, however he does not. His last album with Dokken was Shadowlife. He has been replaced with Reb Beach for Erase The Slate and this album. I am a HUGE G. Lynch fan, however I think Reb Beach does an excellent job here replacing G. Lynch. The group sounds ""Thin"", the same way they sounded on Erase The Slate. Don's voice is about ragged out, and they just seem off the groove. Unless you are wanting to have 2 or 3 of Dokken's newest songs performed live, I would reccomend Beast From The East, Dokken's 1987 live album. It is more representative of the presence this group can have in a live arena. That said, this is a good album, but just does not pull it off."
4,Don't forget the website!,"I really enjoyed this book, i picked it up on sale and thought that i would never actually read it (pop stars? blegh!). i ended up being floored by its complexity, and just by the thought of Siamese twin pop stars. i also liked how it was placed in real time, making references to jay Leno and Britney spears. and don't forget the website that was mentioned on the back of the book! if you go there they have downloads of three of the Sparks Sisters' songs (even though they aren't real, which makes me wonder where they came from and if the author isn't writer/songwriter/musician). I did feel that the ending was a bit rushed, and their suicide/accident wasn't thoroughly explained."
2,A HIT SONG does not an ALBUM make!,"Though Kemp had success with the release of the hit single ""Just Got Paid"" (presented here in the longer, album version), the rest of the album is rather mediocre, due in part to Kemp's less-than-spectacular voice and songs that didn't age well, only fit for the 80's from which they were spawned.The backing musicians shine, however, especially co-songwriter/co-producer Vincent Henry who excels playing both alto and baritone saxophones on the ""Urban Times Medley,"" an homage to Marvin Gaye, featuring both ""Inner City Blues (Makes Me Wanna Holler)"" paired with ""Mercy, Mercy Me (Ecology)""."
1,Catching Big Bass,"Do not let the video case fool you. The two guys on the cover are not even in the video and they are not even fishing from a bass boat, they are fishing from a plastic car top boat on a pond. The so called expert spends more time fixing a back lash then he does fishing and he only catches one small fish. The other guy catches all the fish that were not that great. The information from this video was bad, these guys knew nothing really of bass other then what they read from a book. My 10 year old son could do a better video then these jerks. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!"

4,Polo Romper,I purchased this item as a baby shower gift and was more than pleased with the quality of the item. It was a hit with the mother and the father. It is more than worth the price.
1,Try a Palm or IPAQ instead,"The Handspring Platinum performs well. The only problem is that it is very poorly made. In the first 2 weeks of owning mine, the glass cover cracked in three places. It was stored in the protective case in a leather bag and treated gently. I've dropped other PDAs and cell phones before and not had them cracked. If you plan on using your PDA, I'd suggest another. Oh, and the warranty, of course, does not cover the glass surface. They'll charge you [price] to replace it."
1,PDA,"I received the Handspring Visor Platinum but found out that it was so out of date that no product updates were available and that even the company that made them no longer existed. Within 2 weeks it stopped working, but it was cheaper to just put it away than send it back."
4,The pleasures of Platinum,"The Handspring Platinum is easy to use, easy to set up and does what it says it will. In this presidential election season, it's a pleasure to see one item that is as advertised.The Platinum fits comfortably in the hand, the Grafiti handwriting language is easy to learn and use, and it fits in my dress shirt pockets. Having used Windows CE devices in the past, I find the Platinum a pleasure to use by comparison.A drawback to the Platinum: it does not come with any games preloaded. A solitare or tic-tac-toe game would be a nice bonus and a great way to have fun with the device right out of the box.Overall a good value, but you do have to wonder why no one discounts the Handspring. Hmmmmmm"
2,OK. Just OK.,"6 month of normal use and my Visor Platinum is dead as a doorknob; Handspring customer service hasn't impressed me so far either. A first call was unsuccessful: phone support cannot access online registration data (first you loose time by telling them who you are, where you are, then you have to tell them serial#).Overall, my impression of Visor's quality of workmanship and design is _average_ at best. Extension slot is cumbersome, and quite useless apart from 8Mb memory extension or backup of system memory modules. Which would not be necessary if unit had extra memory and NVRAM in the first place. When module sticks out like on newest Visor, it is quite inconvinient and looks bad. I would rather choose better screen, smaller size, and larger base memory - I think of Sony as of better choice now."
2,Compaq Aero 1550 is much better...,"I recently bought a Compaq Aero 1550 from Amazon.com. If anyone is seriously considering buying any kind of Handspring Visor (I was), I think that the Aero 1550 is way better. It has more memory, it is thinner and more portable. It has a rechargable Lithium-Ion battery instead of the hassle of AAAs. It can play MP3s without the need for a Springboard expansion module, and you can just buy a 64 MB CompactFlash card for it for $100, instead of the $250 one for the Visor. All of the Springboard modules are WAY too expensive. Who would want a phone for $300 when you can buy a better phone for $100-$200! Overall, the Aero 1550 is a great PDA that runs Windows Pocket PC. Pocket PC is starting to get more and more software, and this resembles Windows 98. Take a look at this machine!"
2,bad price,"i think the PDA itself is awesome but if u want a good price with a free cradle, just go to [another website]..."
2,great operating system but that is about it,"The palm operating system is an amazing product that really makes organizing your life easier. Unfortunately, the visor platinum hardware is sorely disappointing. It has a cheap feel, is bulky compared to its competitors, and has a very clumsy cover and pouch. I have already had significant hardware problems with my visor and have had to get a replacement."
4,A Good PDA,"I've been using the Visor Platinum for 2 months now and find it an excellent companion. Fit and finish are OK. Haven't found a palm app I can't run. AvantGo rocks.pros - It's fast. I can search my email and use large spreadsheets very easily; also quick sync using the USB cradle - It's expandable. I can read and write to compactflash cards using a springboard adapter; + keyboard + modem and I can leave that 5lb laptop in the office.cons - it's not as aesthetically pleasing as the Palm V - the form factor is a little bulky - not sure how the painted finish will hold up - case options are a somewhat limited compared with the Palmswash - disposable batteries; yes it would be nice to recharge on the cradle, but I keep spares scattered at home, office and in the briefcase; and they're easy to find on travel. I'm considering using AAA LiON rechargeables.If you work with large amounts of data and you want access to PalmOS apps, Visor Platinum is a very good option."
4,O/S not upgradable,"This is the cream of the crop for greyscale Palm-OS organizers. Runs all of your palm 3.5 apps, can add a cellphone module or wireless network module to be connected on the go. 8 megs of ram is good for everything except carrying a library or alot of Avant-Go (offline web). I'd highly recommend this to most people; however, if the extra 13 Mhz isn't important, save your cash and get a Palm-IIIxe, with 8 megs of ram, flash-upgradable O/S (handspring O/S is in ROM to save costs), and is much cheaper (pricewatch listings around $180)"
4,Excellent purchase,"I bought my visor platinum after christmas and use it in my medical practice. It has made many of my duties easier and quicker. I now no longer carry around drug books or a patient list. I can get quick reference to drug manuals, clinical guidelines, my patient list with consults and to-do list incorporated. I download my email to my visor every morning and read it at my leisure. If you are thinking of buying a handheld I strongly reccomend the visor platinum, the only drawback I can come up with is that it is bigger than the palm V, but certainly less expensive. It's size may make it hard to carry in a shirt pocket, but with the excellent belt clip case from Targus I manage just fine."
5,VERY useful tool!,"Ok, this gadget didn't ""change my life"", but it did make somethings much easier. My wife and I both bought one and now we can sync events we've planned, to do lists, memos, and other options. It is also the handiest little way I've found to organize all the notes I compose to myself through out my day. REALLY beats all the little scraps of paper I used to lose. I've actually used this to start writting projects that otherwise ended up in piles of notes and scraps.There are alot of really good applications for the Visor, some are really useful such as the Word and Excel file editor and the Outlook mail function. Some are just plain fun (like the Star Trek sounds).If you are an unorganized person or just a geek who wants a new toy, you will not be disappointed in this product!"
2,To View or Not to View,"The handspring visor platinum is being returned today for a Palm colored screen. The visor's screen is hard to view and the backlight does not provide enough contrast.As well, I received a low battery warning and within minutes of use, it turned off. After replacing the batteries, I found that my information was deleted. This is just not acceptable. If it requires batteries, there should be a back up battery available as in Casio products.I am going to buy a palm with colored screen and rechargeable batteries."
2,Screen stinks,"i am very dissappointed with the visor platinum because after only owning it for 2 weeks, i dropped it and the screen cracked and now it doesn't work. I don't think the screen should be that fragile. Also, the warranty that comes with the platinum does not cover screen fixes, so i have to shell out $100 dollars to get it fixed. I'm so mad!!!!!!"
3,Helpful of course!,I find my handspring visor quite helpful and easy to use in conjunction with my computer. Its cheaper than the Palm and has great warrenty options.
2,Read this review before you buy,I like Palm instead of Visor with following reasons:1) Visor is faster but Palm is fast enough for most applications. Input speed is critical.2) Any Visor cannot be upgraded in a new Palm OS even you want to pay it. Palm units can be upgraded with about $15. Handspring wants its customers to buy a new Visor instead of upgrading OS.3) Visor's expansion modules (wireless phone and MP3 player) are too expensive so that you rather buy alone products with less half price.4) My computer of 2 1/2 years old doesn't have a UCB port. It would cost me extra $$ to buy serial cable.
4,No disappointment here,"After much debate, I opted for the Handspring over the newest Sony Clie. I chose the Platinum over the Deluxe mainly because of the newer OS (3.5 vs 3.1) and the 16 shades of gray vs 4. That stated, I have been overjoyed with my Handspring. It's larger than the Clie and this provides more area for reading and writing. I was attracted to the Clie's use of memory disks but later discovered, with Handspring modules, I can upgrade using SmartMedia (which does not lock me into a proprietary medium like with Sony). My co-workers have the Visor Deluxe and we can tell a bit of speed difference between the two, but both appear fast enough regardless. The only reason I gave the Platinum four vs five stars is the backlighting. You really need to be in a dark space for it to work well. Compared with the Palm's whose backlighting works well in low light, the Handspring becomes unreadible in low light with the backlight engaged...For the ease and comfort, you won't be disappointed...."
1,its not the full movie,Thought this was the full movie so I could download it and watch it on the airplane. it was a waste of time and only a preview.
4,Funny movie,It’s a fun movie I enjoyed watching. I would recommend this movie. It’s a couple’s movie that most anyone can enjoy.
3,Ooops - thought I was getting the movie,"My fault, I didn't read everything, just clicked on the ""Watch Now"". It was good to watch and see how they did what thought - just wish I'd seen the movie first."
2,Not even good as a trailer,"Happy with this in a way. Sux even as a trailer. So it saved me even considering paying for the movie. I will give it two stars only because it saved me money, and Jennifer Anniston is hot even in something bad."
5,Perfect!,This 6 inch post is hard to find but is the perfect height for what I am looking for!! Great product!
4,Really a fantastic photographer,The photographer from this book took my wedding photos. We hired him based on his amazing work with musicians. I only wish I could buy more of his work through amazon.
1,It might be okay if it weren't for the software,The software is horrible. It wasn't obvious how the files were saved and for reasons known only to the manufacture there didn't seem to be a way to name the file. Very strange. I returned the scanner immediately.
1,NY Times book of facts,"Much too superficial, skips a lot of things for example in the section on rivers it does not list many of the India river such as Yamuna, Cauveri, etc. Very superficial in the area of film - just not useful"
3,"Easy to make this mistake, but ...","The New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge looks formidably well informed, something that should be read from cover to cover.But thumbing through it, I came to ""Religions"". After 9/11, we all need to be better informed about what Islam really means, right?On page 506, I came to this statement about the Koran, the holy book of Islam:""Chapters are arranged by length, from shortest to longest, and cover a wide range of topics.""Actually, no. English translations of the Koran are not hard to find, and reference to a reputable translation will reveal that the chapters (or suras) are indeed arranged by length, but from LONGEST (at the start of the Koran) to the SHORTEST (at the end of the Koran).If The New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge makes such a simple but fundamental error on this topic, do I need to read further on this topic (or any other topic)?"
5,Informative and readable,"The Internet has pushed collections like this towards irrelevance, but this book's clear organization and attractive design make it a welcome resource. The text is organized into about 30 main topics (e.g. 'History') and each main topic is composed of several subtopics ('World History', 'Major Wars in History' and 'History of the Unites States'). These main topics and subtopics appear at the top of every page and provide high accessibility. The book also contains a biographical dictionary and almanac-like lists and tables. Makes a great gift (my sister gave it to me)."
4,A Barbie Set for the rest of us,"I have all the DC Comics Barbies (except the very expensive Catwoman), and I've been impressed with the detail to their costumes. I do NOT like the bendy bodies, though, so I've customized all mine using the articulated bodies from Western Barbies, turning them into more of an action figure. Mattel would do well to start making most of their Barbies with these bodies, which have fully articulated arms, legs and waists. Overall, these are not bad figures, and it would be great if Mattel made some more of DC's female heroes and villains. (In the meantime, I've got plans to make my own Black Canary and Zatanna... POWER OF FISHNETS!)"
4,"Barbie ""Wonder Woman"" Doll","This item is fun as a collector piece, and even more so now due to a Wonder Woman movie coming out soon! It brought back good memories of the 70s TV show - one of the first TV women to be resourceful and STRONG!"
4,For nosy romantics . . .,"GRIFFIN & SABINE is the ultimate gift for the naturally curious. This peek into the correspondence between two people - with letters to open, postcards to read, handwriting to decipher - gives the reader the sensation of having stumbled upon a romantic mystery to which only the individual reader is privvy. The story is nothing much, but the discovery of it is exquisite. The art used to development the concept is engaging and not at all cutesy. Because of its interactive nature, this book feels intimately known, privately owned, a secret kept closed between the covers.This is a great gift book. If you are looking for substantial reading, skip this, but if you want a diversion, something to explore and take in visually, this book is for you."
5,Innovative Story Telling,I have been recommened this book by an online friend of mine. Griffin and Sabine was my very first experience in off line interactive reading. I very much enjoyed it. Great idea and such an innovative way of presenting a love story between two artists. Wonderful!
4,A book of a different color,"This is the second epistolary novel I read this week. This one is far more aesthetically pleasing--both of the writers are artists, and the letters have tiny envelopes glued to the pages. It makes you want to read this book very carefully, to treat it reverently. I found this book very emotionally satisfying, although I want to read it through a second time and decide how appropriate each of various endings are. It's Magical Realism with a British bent, and although it's not a terribly long read it can still be involving. Take your time--savor it."
2,What a disappointment,"After hearing people rave about this book I finally shelled out the dough to buy it. What a stupid book. The art wasn't ""great"" or even intersting and the story was dull. BORING, don't waste your money!"
2,Was I ever disappointed.,"I belong to a collage artist group and everyone talked about these books and altering them. Now I see why they wanted to alter them, to give the pages & story some character. The story was simplistic and without imagination and the pictures, we all do so much better. There are much better books out there, don't know what all the fuss is about this one. Don't waste your money!"
1,"Weird, not worth your money","These books are too weird. They left me feeling dark and strange, like reading about possession (isn't that really what they're about? Be honest!). Don't bother to waste your time and money."
5,A lovely little book,"The true attraction of this book is that it is correspondence - letters to and from people who are at first wrapped in mystery, and whose characters develop over the length of the book. And don't we all love to read letters! Especially other people's - there is something mysterious and forbidden about it. The letters are beautifully written, and really engross you with their richness and detail.And it is a beautiful looking book too. The illustrations are wonderful - it is almost like a grown up child's book. Ultimately, it is appealing in all ways. I can recommend it to any worthy book collector!"
5,One of my favorites!,"I just can't say enough about this book! It was given to me by a friend, as a gift, and I just fell in love with the book and the story. The letters that you can remove from a ""real"" envelope are a wonderful touch, and the artwork adds an entirely new dimension to the experience! If you are at all romantic, or slightly nosy, or would love to be ""in"" on two people's story as they fall in love, then buy this book!"
5,A lovely book of exquisite art work and beatiful words.,"Nick Bantock brings delight to every page of this book by his artwork and his writings.This book is a sweet love story with two illusionary people who you learn about from postcards and removable letters which are typed and written by either Griffin or Sabine.As the letters and artwork are sent to and from Griffin and Sabine, the reader finds themselves in a love affairthat seems almost too weird to be real. At some point you wonder if these people ever existed, are they real and Bantock is just retelling theirstory in some bizarre manner; or are they pure and simple justtwo delightful characters in a book of love and loss?"
3,Well done but didn't care for the subject matter.,I have to honestly say that this was a really good film. Excellent soundtrack and cinematography and acting to say the least. But I just absolutley felt depressed and down after watching it. True this is a true story and its based off of true events. But man it was so dark and somber and disturbing there just wasn't any light at the end of the tunnel. The main character I literly hated and I felt so sorry for the yound girl. And I just actually can't believe she will be getting out of jail next year. How ? How ? is this possible after she did such a horrilbe thing ? Watch at your own risk but I am warning you ..this will bring you down a few notches. You will need a comedy or something light after viewing this.
5,I heard 10 seconds of it and loved it,"Though it may only be 38 minutes long, Our Point Of Departure is a real good album. This entire album is one continous song (it's an instrumental), all at the same tempo, split into 6 different tracks. What i enjoyed about this is the drums (african voodoo drums are an influence) and the amazingly crazy horns. This is a CD truly worth the money. And i'm not sure about you, but it gives me a certain feeling of power knowing and liking a band which nobody's ever heard of."
3,NOT THE BEST,"Ok, I'm a No Doubt fan, a harcore one. I agree with Dave Schult, there's too much that is missed... They have the oportunity to put a lot of material from BSC singles... The singles... wow that doesn't do any for me, I can rip all my ND cds and make a compilation... the only reason to buy this is for the videos,only if you like a lot ND, beacuse I don't think they have the best videos, in my opinion the best videos are from Bjork, and u can buy separately, you don''t have to buy an expènsive box... And if u want to see the best videos, go and search for Michel Gondry, he's the genius, he has a DVD with the best videos ever made..."
2,I'm Not Sure About This,"I am a little sceptical about No Doubt having a box set because I feel a box set should have the music spanning the bands career or the prime of their career. I like the No Doubt albums(except rock steady)alright. But this band seems a little young for a box set just yet. It all seems a plan to get a little more ca$h. I would think the set a little thin on material since they have only had five album releases. This would have been kind of like The Beatles realseing a box set in the mid sixities. Some great music?yes, career/prime spanning box set?no"
2,missing soooo much,"as a no doubt fan since 93, i find that this set hardly lives up to it's name. where are the singles from ""beacon street"" ? (and their b sides?!?), where are the early tracks from the various ska compilations they appeared on? where are tracks from the early demo tapes?? certainly these things would be of great interest to all no doubt fans to have compiled but no, it seems this only packs what the mainstream audience already has, with a few things - an 80's cover and a few remixes - disguised as ""bonuses."" the videos and the live stuff salvage it somewhat, but all in all ""boom box"" is only scratching a really big surface."
3,dealing with a fixed deck,"I think the title is applicable to most of Hoyle's games (card games or not). I have noticed in some of the games that when there is more than one computer player, they gang up on you. In some of the other multiplayer games you immediately start behind. The game feels like it's rigged to keep you losing in an attempt to keep you playing. They are applying casino logic to a word game. With all this said, I still highly recommend the game for those of you (like me) who really enjoy these types of games."
4,disappointed,YOU ADVERTISE 10 CHARACTERS ON THE GAME DOUBLECROSSBUT THERE ARE NOT. YOU ADVERTISE A DOG AND ANDINOSAUR ON THE GAME. I HAVE AN IDEA WHY NOTACTUALLY MAKE THE DOUBLECROSS GAME WITH ALL THECHARACTERS YOU ADVERTISE. THE GAME IS A LOT OF FUN.I LIKE THE FACT THAT THE CHARACTERS TALK. I WOULDENJOY IT MORE IF ALL THE CHARACTERS YOU ADVERTISEWERE ON THE GAME.
3,unsafe book,well the book is really not that good it doese not explain it very well. if you were to go and have sex than im pretty sure you will wind up with an STD or a child. SO DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!! IT IS UNSAFE!!!!!!!!!!
5,"thorough, solid, compelling study",This is an interesting longitudinal study of a systemic staff development effort. The study points out to us once again the principals' leadership changing the school culture as well as classroom practices.
4,Power of imagination,Basic stuff but worthwhile reading. Something I never really thought about in this kind of detail and so it opens the mind some.
3,"Good idea, but weak interpretation","The idea of the book is good, but the writers seem to deal with each church in a summary way, using poor graphic material -understandable for XIX and early XX century photos but not so for the views today-.The authors should have done a little more homework for facts and stories, as well as search for better views or drawings, and include some on how the church stands today."
5,Even I can make pie!,"I purchased this book several years ago. Being a pie-phobe, I figured I might have a chance with this title. I have made MANY pies from this and they have all turned out GREAT! Try the Lemon Sponge pie.... outrageous. Another fun one is mock pecan. Watch people's faces when you serve it. I like that it gives some good basic recipes and sugar ranges, in case you don't like your pie as sweet. I'm still in search of the perfect pie crust technique (the problem is mine), but the crusts here are a great place to start! Terrific book."
4,Lots of goodies,Found lots of info and some nostalgia and many nice recipes. This is a small book but full of info.
3,Does not come with case,"I was disappointed that it did not come with the mount plate and cover, another $35! At the combined there are many other less expensive solutions."
4,I Love This Song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This song is da bomb! The beat is really fast and I love the lyrics! This song is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"Pyhton are the best, and they're British!!!","Being 16 and not around when python came out i don't remember the impact, but they are our best comedy show in the history of Britain.apart from the goon show, and a few other things.They're the best and i recommend every python fan to purchase this BBC video (and why you're at it buy the best of flying circus aswell)SAY NO MORE!!!!"
2,PhDs only need apply,"I appreciated this book for the insights it was able to give me on a city that I will soon visit, but I found the writing style dry and overburdened with unnecessary details. Several times, I fell asleep trying to make it through the reading. Other times, I would lower the book in exasperation and say to myself, ""Is this Grandin's dissertation?"" The book is very informative, but it is not an accessible read for the layperson."
1,If only I could give it zero stars,"Where do I begin with the rating the Fiesta diet? For starters, it is junk food, feeding your rodents garbage may be healthier. Kaytee attempts to make their diet ""nutritionally complete"" by providing a pellet mixed in with all of the nuts. However, just like small children, most rodents eat the fattening nuts and corn (which holds little nutritional value) before eating the healthy pellet mixes.If you have rats, guinea pigs, or other small animals, feed them Oxbow. I have fed my rat girls Oxbow for ages and it is much better for them. If you insist on buying Kaytee brand food, buy their forti-diet pellets. At least that isn't as fattening, though it is still not the highest quality of ingredients. Rats also do well on Harlan Tekland, yet it is very pricey and difficult to find in stores.If people disagree with this harsh but true review, ask any local vet or true rat breeder. They will tell you that any of the Fiesta diets are terrible for any animal."
1,The mystery scanner,"The software which came with this product Umax Astra e3470 was a nightmare. The scanner would turn itself on and scan the lid of the scanner then print a picture of the lid, while I was on another program, even the internet, two to three times a day. My computer stopped shutting down properly. My only hope was to uninstall this software. My computer is now on the mend. Teck support is a lost hope with Umax. They want you to find out what their problems are with their software, then let them know. My computer is a Gateway Performance 1000 with Windows Me."
3,"Great Writers, Not So Great Essays","I didn't find these particular examples to be the best of the best, which made me wonder if there could have been some amazing essays by lesser known people who deserved a chance. The exception is ""Joyas Voladores,"" one the shortest, but the mightiest of the bunch."
2,don't get this so-called guide!,"It's a great guide if your'e a new-comer to the Zelda games,it does tell you where heart pieces are and things like that,but the names are so messed up!For example,it calls the well-known deku scrub an akindo nut!(I could tell you about all the other mistakes but I'm limited to 1,000 words)I suggest looking for the Zelda guide from Nintendo Power."
5,The Best!,"This book reveals everything you need to know in the game. It has great maps to look at and plan how you can get the items easily. It also includes every item in the game and much more! In other words, it has everything you need to beat the terrifying Majora's Mask."
3,Okay...,"You could use this guide and get through the game, but I wouldn't pay more than $10.00 to get it. This book is FULL of typos. The enemy description page is loaded with them. The maps are also confusing. If you can figure out your way from the maps, and you can read them and stuff, I suppose it's worth the money. I would highly suggest looking at it before spending any money on it however."
1,Such high hopes.....,"Thought I'd replace rear axle - left/right. They look outstanding. However after installing and going out for test drive, one of the drums was out-of-round enough to make a rhythmic thumping when braking. Replaced with old drums and sound disappeared. Oh well......"
4,A quality effort by The Gotan Project,I have not purchased La Revancha del Tango yet but I must say if it's as good as Lunatico I'll be buying it. My gf loves to Tango but sometimes you want a little more oomph to your music. Enter Gotan. Everything is so tasteful and they even splice Hip Hop into the music without it sounding jarring or out of place. Beware this is a Time Warp album. Meaning every song is so good you'll find time just disappears when you sit down to play it.
3,"Es bueno, pero me gusta mas el primero","Lo escuche muchas veces, y tal vez sea tanta fusión con otros ritmos y generos lo que no me gusta tanto, es un disco bien hecho, con buen concepto, pero prefiero el primero que es mas tanguero y electrónico."
3,Hastak da mak,"I recently purchased the New Haystak album,and to tell you the truth I only bought it for one song ""recon"". but after listening to the entire album I found it to be one of the best I've heard this year. This album contains a tight combination of beats and rhymes. Songs such as ""On Trial"",""Down South Playas"" and ""Dollar"" are just plain tight. One of the best things about the album is that even the mediocre cuts are worth a listen,due to haystaks lyrical ability. All in all a its worth buying"
3,3.5 Stars,"Great hip hop music isn't what an artist looks like or what is popular, it is being original and doing what you know Car Fulla White Boys is an example of that. Haystak is an original artist and this album displays that. MUST HAVE."
4,Beautiful photos and art,"As a huge fan of fancy goldfish, I was pleased with this book. The cover and interior are lovely, with hundreds of photographs and art samples.However, the book would be MUCH better if it was larger. As it is, the photographs are often stuck in the spine of the book, difficult to see."
2,Wanted to like this but....,"St. Agatha's Breast by T.C. Van Adler was sadly, a waste of time. The only redeeming quality to the book is the plight of preserving the artistic treasures of Rome. All too often because of corruption, greed and apathy, many of Rome's finest artistic landmarks and works get lost to oblivion. Another illumnating aspect is you see how depraved some priests are and all the cases of priests abusing children don't seem as far fetched when you read this book. The plot was convoluted and the characters totally un-sympathetic. I enjoy adult stories like the next person, but the titillation went overboard for the sake of sensationalism."
4,Try this for a good chuckle!,"This is a beautifully written, deliciously funny book. Once I realized it was OK to laugh, I often chuckled aloud - a bit like laughing aloud in a church, given the cast of characters and the setting! I especially appreciated the short chapters (easy to pick the book up in odd moments) and the skillful way in which expectations are raised at the end of each chapter (difficult to put down). I was always eager to find out what could possibly happen next - the mark of a good writer. I hope T.C. Van Adler will delight us with more publications"
4,READ THIS BOOK!,"This book is PAST PERFECT FUTURE TENSE: A COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES,POEMS AND INCOHERENT RAMBLINGS by Patrick J. Norton. ( When you read this book you will see that it is very aptly titled.) The short stories are gems...provocative, ironic and, in many cases, disturbing. The poems are evocative of emotional places we've all been and suggest that this is a young writer. (You'll understand that when you read the book.) At 95 pages, it's a quick read; but it'll take you a while to stop thinking about what you've read. More, More!"
4,An essential book on film,"This is one of the best books on film; it is so by the nature of its intelligent concentration on the great directors of Hollywood. George Stevens, Jr. has collected the transcripts of a series at the AmericanFilm Insitute; the remarks, the illustrations, the discussions are as relevant today as they were then. This book is especially welcome at a time when unqualified writers are spewing out nonsense about film. Renoir, Felline, Bergman, these are among the directors whose work this excellent book illuminates."
2,The lion terrified my son!!,"My son is a huge fan of ""Hide and Seek Elmer"". I bought ""Elmer's Friends"" thinking he would love this as well. There is a lion in this book that has the most frightening face. My son would start to cry the page before in anticipation of the upcoming lion. I tore that page out of the book and now my child can enjoy this book again. The other animals are fun, but the lion is terrifying!"
5,Excellent Choice,"This book is one of my two-year-old's favorites. Elmer is very lovable, the story and pictures are entertaining and the book is sturdy/made well. I would recommend all of the books in this set."
4,Daughter loves it!,Great hardcover book for baby learning italian. It's very helpful having the english words underneath the italian words. My daughter just beams when I read this to her. Fun story.
2,poor translation but nice pictures,"We recieved this book and my daughter who is 10 months old, loved the pictures and the colorful animals. BUT, We the parents were not happy about the translation, it was poorly translated and as we speak arabic at home and speak arabic to our children we would have liked and expected the book to be translated properly."
2,Not what I had hoped for,"This was cheaply made and began falling apart almost immediately. further, it poorly fit my 2005 Ranger UTV. I have done better strapping small tarps over the box to keep the UTV's contents clean and dry. Save your dough - this product leaves alot to be desired in terms of both quality and function."
1,For me it was a waste of money,"This book is very dense, both in layout and writing style. It is long on verbose discussion and short on practical examples and advice. For example there 24 pages on release version numbering but only 8 pages on revision branching and merging.The layout would have benefited from lists and more diagrams. It would also have been useful to have more example templates and processes.What also annoyed were the basic mistakes e.g. How to correctly number a branch revision (it should normally be parentRev.BranchNumber.RevisionOnBranch, not parentRev.RevisionOnBranch).I think the editors must take a significant portion of the blame for failing to help the author deliver a more readable book"
2,"Good Information, Poor Quality","Just received this book after waiting 2 months for it. I purchased it because it is often referenced in other CM books.After just scanning through the book, I can tell that it contains some valuable information. One big minus is the index consists of blank pages, which is really bad for a technical book.The physical quality of the book is very poor. Cheap binding, cheap paper, cheap type. Except for the nice cover, it looks like it was thrown together at Kinkos.What really irks me is that I paid almost $50 for this book. This is something I would pay $10 for a PDF download."
2,Definitely not worth the money,"If you are working for a company that makes software, chances are you have a guy who is assigned the task of release management. Do yourself a favor and go talk to this guy -- you'll probably get better insights than this book has to offer after draining $50 bucks out of your pocket. I only gave it 2 stars since the author touches on the right topics but fails to deliver useful content.He delves into one specific style of release management and engineering (probably what the author's company does) and does not talk too much about alternate styles at all -- and the release methodology suggested by the book is less elegant than some of the release processes I've seen.And as a bonus, a few blank pages serves as the index for the book. I was expecting better quality of content and presentation from Prentice Hall."
5,Great Overview,"This book provides the clarion difference between much ""evangelical"" thought and the biblical basis and truths of salvation of Jesus Christ and Him Crucified."
2,Babies are not sinners!,"I was surprised to learn that the author believes that babies and young children are sinners, and needed to be sprinkled with water to enter Heaven. This is not what the Bible teaches and is not a true reflection of the character of God. Sinners are those who are capable of believing and repenting, and not innocent infants. Sin is not passed on through Adam or anyone else, but we are all responsible for our own sin (Ezek.18:20). Baptism is by immersion is clearly taught in many passages such as Romans 6:3-4 and Colossians 2:12."
3,For Collectors only..,"While the doll is cute, There is a problem with the bendie arms.. They seem too stiff... I do not like the boots as well as they do tend to come off too easily... as a collectors Doll she is perfect! I have her displayed on my dresser... I would like to see a doll that would be fun for kids and adults to play with..Barbie is great as the udated verson of Supergirl.. Now if we could get Ken as The Greatest American Hero... That is a possibility... But all in all the Supergirl doll should be for display only..."
3,Doll was a gift,Got this doll as a gift from my brother way long time ago. It was very unexpected. I'm glad I got it as a gift because I would have never bought this doll with my own money. I also think that the reason my brother bought this for me was because it was cheap and on sale. I am glad I have it though. Thanks bro!
5,Sacco and Vanzetti are a Lesson to All,"These letters are extraordinary, the narrative along with the letters paint a picture of the times in the early 20th century. They are so relevant, even today. These letters make us think, and examine our lives and our prejudices. Their guilt or innocence is irrelevant; the real question is, can two Italian immigrants who are self proclaimed anarchists, in a Country that claims to defend all beliefs, get a fair trial for a murder they claim they never committed? Read the book, the answer is painfully no. And it makes you think, can certain immigrants today, perhaps wrongly accused of terrorism, get a fair trial? I am afraid of what the answer might be. This book is a must read for anyone who claims the Constitution and Bill of Rights are the most important documents ever written in America."
2,It was alright,"I didn't really like this book 'coz I felt it was far too ""planned"". No one has a ""planned"" life. It's too unreal in many ways. I wouldn't call it ""an immigrants tale of woe and hope"". I don't know - I'm still sitting on the fence on this one!"
2,"Mukherjee wrote a disgusting, bland and worthless book","Jasmine, at points, sounds like a soap opera that no one watches because it is so aweful. This book makes everything sound so miserable and blown out of shape. If a man and woman meet, then they are secretly in love, the woman is pregnant, or they kill each other. This book is pointless and rambles on about how different America is from India as if she expected them to be exactly identical. As for Jasmine's character, who has about 10 names in the book, she is a bland fool. No characters are ever developed in this book and they all die prematurely. To add to that, the ending is unrealistic, and reminds me of the end of Pearl Harbor. Jasmine's final decisions are without reason, and seem faulty even to the SIMPLE READER! The only reason this book didn't get one star is that she didn't make any spelling mistakes."
4,Jeez.,"You people are morons. Definitely a worthwhile read. Well presented, thought-provoking, and more ""realistic"" than anyone is giving it credit for. Open your minds a bit, people...this is MODERN literature...not everything is ""Jane Eyre."""
3,"Enlightened, But...",This book was in general very good. But it lacked a certin quality that would have made it a five star book. Learning about what it was like when she lived in her country was in fact the best part of the book. It gave a great cultural view on what it is like to be woman in a third-world country. When she came to America thats when the book started to lack the fire that i was drawn to.
1,boring,"The only sections of this novel that are worth reading are the those that take place in India when Jasmine is a child-bride. The rest of the ""novel"" reads like a diary entry...nothing much happens after Jasmine moves to Iowa and I found myself not really caring about the characters.It seems that Ms. Mukherjee should try and write more than one draft of her novels before sending it to her publisher."
1,Top ten.... worst books I've ever read.,"Jasmine is a quirky unspectacular novel that completely failed to capture an audience. I just couldn't help but not like the main character. It comes off as a sob story, of a woman who simply bounces from whatever can make her life easier to the next sucking the life out of everything she encounters. The two word sentences and abysmal flow of the book makes it a surprise that I ever finished it. A terrible novel."
4,A good effort,"I found this to be an interesting take on the American dream from the viewpoint of an illegal immigrant. Jasmine evolves from a poor girl in India to a nanny in NYC to the ""wife"" of a banker in middle America. Jasmine is not an altogether sympathetic character, but she is enthralling. A quick read that I highly recommend."
5,"Wonderful, exciting, fascinating","It was a little confusing, but overall it was a wonderful story and wonderfully put together. I recommend this book to people only open to the unordinary and to people interested in the way of life of other cultures"
3,A interesting book,"The book Jasmine, by Bharati Mukerjee is a interesting and at times challenging book. The plot in the book does not flow in a orderly fashion like most books do. Instead it is mainly told in flashbacks from Jasmine's, the main character, life.I really enjoyed this book in that the way it was written makes you want to read on until the end so you see how all the flashbacks fit together to tell her life story.I would recomend this book to another reader because it has many life lessons and values that one learns throughout their lives."
2,Interesting . . . but . . .,"I found the mythic element interesting, but the development of character lacking. It was all so mechanical, not human almost. A disappointing book."
3,Somewhat Raunchy,"The humor in this film is rather dry. But, as always, Julian McMahon (Hutch) portrays quite well an egocentric womanizer who can get anyone that he so chooses. (Art imitating life?) And he's probably the most likeable of all the characters in the flick. The raunch in this film is prevalent, but it's almost G-rated in nature. In other words, it exists, but is not graphic or explicit. Overall, it's a good film to see if you have nothing better to do. But it's definitely not a ""must-see."""
2,Are You Kidding?,"I have no respect for the previous reviewers who rated this garbage 4 Stars. If you liked ""Southland Tales"" maybe you would like this absolutely horrible cheeseball 'comedy'. I'm not going to waste my breath and write a long-winded complaint about this 'comedy', let's just say you have been warned. sometimes it is sufficient to say it sucks... It is worthless."
3,Could be a great printer.,"This was our third HP DeskJet printer for home use in 10 years. The first two lasted a total of 9.5 years but the 990cse has only lasted 5 months. The 990cse worked flawlessly for a couple of months then it began having problems with the first sheet in every print job. After sensing the paper, there would be a loud grinding/clunk and the print head would jamb to one side. Once the initial sheet was cleared, all subsequent sheets would be fine. After trying new ink cartridges, new paper, new drivers the problem persisted. I was about ready to take it back for repairs when the printer died altogether. When the 990cse was working, the print quality and speed were fantastic. The duplex unit, which I thought would be problematic, worked great. It could have been a great printer. I will return it for replacement and hopefully my next 990cse is not built on a Monday."
1,They won't let me rate this printer a 0 Star... so;,"I recently decided to move over to this line of printer from a long and well used Canon 4300. I've never been in need of a more powerful printer until now. I decided that the HP double-sided automation was attractive and the quality would be needed. I've also never heard of paper jams until I bought this either. The print quality was great, although getting paper jams every third print is ridiculous. I fumbled with paper, different weights, the paper travel through the machine, everything that they didn't feel you should be warned about in the handbook. Well, the printer would've been nice, but I don't have time to fix jams every third page or consectutive page. Something else is better out there and I'm sure I could pay $... for it without dealing with getting jammed! :)"
2,Has some problems,"The print quality of this unit is great. However, the duplex unit (two-sided printing module) on this printer has caused me nothing but problems. It worked a few times but now it jams almost every time I try to use it. Followed HP support advice for several frustrating hours to no avail. Not recommended."
4,Good,He was one of the greatest trumpet innovators of early bop! If you can get past old sound quality it is a must have for those who like the early Charlie Parker stuff.
1,Korean war movie,"In my opinion this was a terrible movie. It deals with a corporal (Richard Basehart) who has leadership issues, i.e. will he be able to lead if he is put in that situation. A better movie would be ""Hell is for Heroes"" which also deals with the Korean war, or ""Retreat Hell"" starring Frank Lovejoy. Don't waste your money or time on this one."
3,funk doc,"this was the first redman album that i ever bought.redman's lyrics are good, but i dont really like that funny rap style he has, nah mean.i listened to this cd when i first bought it for a while then i put it in the stack and forgot about it.then a few months later i decided to listen to it again.i really liked it, maybe i was in the redman mood or something, but i listened to it, and i was feeling red.busta gets off on this album pretty tight, and meth.if your a true funk doc fan you will get this, but if you just like when it's meth and red, they only do one song on this album, so just record it from a friend."
3,It coulda been betta!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Dis CD needed more time and effort. Da album had a few good tracks and dats it. I got one word. Refund!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Redman must have smoked too much weed since his last release,"Redman used to be capable of a tight rhyme. He manages to disprove this with his ""Doc's Da Name 2000"" effort. The album's only saving grace is track 12 featuring Method Man. Two words for Redman- RETIRE NOW!"
2,Ugh! Redman please!,"Warning to anybody who was a Redman fan PRIOR to the release of this crappy album! Dont buy this! I was gonna give it 1 star but figured because of past albums like ""Muddy Waters"" and ""Whut? Thee Album"" he deserved some credit. He has fallen into todays trash ""rap"" as previous greats Jay-Z, and Dr Dre have too. This is pretty damn bad!"
2,Not too good,"I didn't like this CD at all. I'll Bee Dat! was the only song I really enjoyed. The lyrics are funny and its got a great beat, but besides that the album is weak! Many of the beats are annoying and the songs are a bit repetitive. I might just not be getting Redman's flow, but I personally didn't enjoy this album at all."
5,"I think that Redman is awesome. this is a good cd,buy it,yes",A great album with some minor flaws. some of the chorus but the beats and raps are kick asssssssssmokin
4,i think this is a very good Cd,the only thing wrong with this Cd is that they have to many skits. they need to cut down on them
3,Average,This album is ok. It could have been a lot better but it's still pretty good. I'll Be Dat is the best track and there are also some hella funny skits on here like Pain In Da A-- Stewardess! Go buy it. It's worth listening to!
5,Krazy Kat,"Redman is a Krazy Kat. He's mad funny, he should come out with a television show or something; him and Method Man. This album is Blazzing."
3,"I was red, man, AFTER DROPPING $$$ ON THIS!","Was the robbing a plane skit supposed to be funny or stupid? I wish your first name was refund, cos every time I listen to the album I think REFUND! I need dat, I need dat, I need dat....."
3,Alright.,"Doc's Da Name 2000 is a solid album, nothing too special. There are over 20 songs and only half of them were o.k. to listen to. My favorites were ""Keep on 99"", ""Jersey Yo"", ""I be that"", and ""Close Your Doors"". The other 8 were average and the rest of the album needed work on production. I think Redman did too many tracks on this. In some cases less means more. If you a true Redman fan you should pick this up."
3,Redman could have done better,"Out of respect, you should buy this album. However you will not hear tight cuts."
4,i think that this is one of his best works,"i like this album better because he made no negative comments as in his last album (""stinkin like haitian under arms""), muddy waters this ablum is fun and at the same time dope. i think he got this album off, i guess that's why it went platium"
1,Original,"This album is too way out there to play. the beats are old and tired. before you decide to buy this CD,,,sleep on it.."
1,Boooo,Why even sell this album. REDMAN PLEASE COME OUT WITH SOMETHING WORTH LISTENING TO. THANK YOU. this CD is trash
1,Boooo,I think that the stars on this thing are rigged because REDMAN sucks. his CD is Wack...and he still gets 5 stars...this sucks...This CD is trash
1,wooooo,THis album is so Kool-aid pumping sweeeeet it gave me a cavity. RedMans heart pumps Kool-aid on this joint. Its tired....Burn it... Give me MC EIHT.
1,Horrifyingly painful to the ears,"Even for rap music this album is pure garbage. I can't believe plastic is wasted on the case of the cd's, paper is wasted on the cd insert, etc. I find it hard to believe that anyone could appriciate this."
5,OFF THE HOOK,"THIS IS ONE OF REDMAN'S BEST ALBUMS. ALL THE BEATS ARE DOPE. THE SONGS ARE DOPE. EVERYTHING IS ALL GOOD. I'M READY FOR THE REDMAN AND METHOD MAN ALBUM, ""AMERICAS MOST BLUNTED""!"
3,redman,i'm sorry but redman doesn't live up to his expectations on this album. his other albums were great but this one didn't appeal to me. some of the songs r great but the other ones kinda suck
3,A poor effort by a good MC,"For my money, this album is just not up to par with redman's earlier work. I suggest Dare Iz a Darkside or Muddy Waters. Both have much better beats, hooks, etc. Or check out 'Whut? Thee Album' if you're looking for the old school P-funk sound."
4,"Lyrics are there, but the beats aren't!","Loved the lyrics to this album, you can feel the energy that Redman brings to the music scene, but as for the beats, he's done better in the past, and it seemed like almost slowed down. But all together the artist who helped make this record and Redman's outrageous style make it a must have!~"
4,redman is one of my favorites and keeps doing better,"i dont listen to much rap, but redman is one of my all-time favorites. i think this album was great. it seems like he gets better with every album he makes. i would recommend it to anybody who likes rap. keep it up redman!"
3,That's It?,"Reading this book was like watching a sitcom on TV: short, sweet, and quickly faded from memory.There was potential here, and I wanted to like 'Savage Membrane', but the story was way under developed. I am a slow reader, and it only took me about 2 hours to read this book. At 208 pages with wide spaced, large type, there was very little substance to this book, and next to no character development.A decent short story, not a good novel."
3,An enjoyable read,"I didn't expect much from this book and I was pleasantly surprised. It was a film noir in writing that resulted in a somewhat stunted writing style but Niles pulls it off in great fashion. Poor character development, except the protagonist Cal McDonald, stunts the book as does the rather short length. Cal McDonald should have his own series as his character is rather interesting to follow and one cannot help but love him. Even if he is a junkie and an ex-cop."
4,Glad there are more,"I picked up this book because the cover image caught my eye; I bought it because the back cover described my kind of book. I wasn't dissapointed. In Savage Membrane, Niles introduces anithero Cal McDonald and sidekick Mo Lock. Cal is a poly-addict who drinks from morning to morning and induldges in pretty much any drug he can get his hands on, except heroin, he had a problem with heroin. Mo Lock, who is a Ghoul, is his faithful partner. Cal is a private investegator who has always had a knack for seeing the evil in the world. If you enjoy Anita Blake or Harry Dresden novels, you'll love this; Savage Membrane is an action packed, humorous, quick read packed full of monstors, magic, and substance (abuse)."
1,Rip Roaring stories....,"I thought, from the title, the book was full of short action stories for young teens who were not good or active readers.I think it was a book on 'how to write' or similar. It sits now. Nobody is interested in it.Another trophy to mistakes I've made."
4,Good background reading,"This biography does just give lip service to the politician's childhood. The author explains the world in which Al Gore grew up. It describes pieces of his father's life in a way which shows you where Al picked up many of his mannerisms. You will see where the candidate came from.After reading through this, I know that Al Gore is not as Green as his book would lead you to believe. He does listen to businesses and has accepted money. This is no different than any other candidate. This book brings all of this to your attention so that you can make your own informed decision.The tone and flow are good. I had no trouble following the narrative or understanding what point the author was trying to make. Too often, an author has his own axe to grind and steps away from informing the reader so that the reader can make his or her own decision. Turque's style makes this a good read."
4,Both sides of the story.....,seems evident in this book. I feel the author made an honest attempt to write an unbiased account of Al Gore. His strengths are demonstrated as well as his faults. The only weak spot in the book is that the 2000 election wasn't covered.
5,An excellent novel,"What really made the book for me were the characters, whose actions and motivations were deep and complex. Though this book is frequently referred to as a mystery, it's not a traditional mystery. Call it a ""literary mystery."" I enjoyed the way the events unfolded and how the death of Dora ended up revealing so much about the people in the village. Everyone says it takes place in the 17th century, but if so, it's before 1603, because Elizabeth is still queen. There's also a romance in case that matters to you."
4,Bone House,"I would first like to say that this book supposedly takes place in the 17th century; however, there is very little that would distinguish that particular time period, from any other, in this book.Now, on to the good stuff. Betsy Tobin has written a very compelling little tale about finding one's place in the world (as well as one's true self,) disguised as a murder mystery. The story and style remind me strongly of Thomas H Cook. Tobin's prose is not as stylish or romantic as Cook's, but she has struck the nerve of human emotion and discovery that many of Cook's books achieve.Although 'Bone House' is a short novel, it is very satisfying in the end. While you are waiting for Tobin's next book, check out Thomas H Cook."
3,Interesting first novel from promising young writer . . .but,"Set in 17th century England, Tobin's ""Bone House"" spins a tale of village intrigue in the time when witches were believed to be real and people were easily afraid. She gives us an enjoyable and light read . . . but the book lacks verisimilitude when it comes to interclass relations . . . The mistress of a 17th century Great House would never have attempted to partner her son and heir with her maid, no matter how desperate she was to see her son married off. Nor would a ladies maid be likely to have the freedom of movement within and without the house that Tobin's protagonist does. The ending was predictable, as was the romantic involvement. One step away from a romance novel, one step away from historical fiction . . . this book stands on its own, and will probably be attractive to readers of both genres. If you're seeking something with a bit more meat, I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,bone house blues,As I sailed along through this book I found it most enjoyable until the end. The bitter end. What a waste of time. I'm tired of authors going for the gross-out when they can't come up with a better tie. I do not recommend this book at all.
3,Godzilla's Revenge Review,"I think that Godzilla's Revenge is a pretty good movie. But there is some things I don't like. First, Minya can't talk or grow. Second, they use scenes from all the Godzilla movies. But it is still a good movie, so I would buy it."
2,Godzilla goes to kiddie land.,"This film marks a period of sharp decline in the G series. Stock footage is used extensively and does not mesh well with the new spfx scenes. Minya looks as awful as ever and the new monster Gabera is one silly creation. The score plays pretty harshly on the ears(calling Akira Ifukube!) as well. That said, the story works pretty well for children. There is much that they can find to enjoy in this film whereas, most adults and older G fans will be left cold by it."
3,A good movie for kids,"This movie was entertaining to me. I saw this movie when I was a kid on TV and I enjoyed it. The fights were not very exciting and they used clips from other movies, but it wasn't that bad. This movie is definitely for kids. Don't compare this movie to the new series Godzilla movies."
1,WHY BOTHER!!!!!!! Half a real movie?????,"I have never seen anything more rediculous than this! Even if you are a ""die-hard"" Godzilla fanatic who has'nt seen this complete piece of crap, I'm warning you, stay away from it as much as you can, I mean it. This is more of a kids movie than a part of the original Godzilla story until ""Godzilla 1985"". It has absolutely nothing to do with any of the other Godzilla films. About half of it is used footage from previous Godzilla films such as ""Son of Godzilla"", the rest is just set around some day-dreaming kid and not the ""Big-Guy"" himself. If you want a Godzilla movie made around this time then I recomend to you ""Destroy All Monsters"" or ""Terror of Mecha-Godzilla"". Not This. PAUL RAYMONDO HEMSLEY"
1,Totally Wierd!!!,This movie was very very wierd. I find it hard to believe that Toho would make such a crummy movie such as this. The only cool parts are Baragon and Godzilla. This movie would only good to a five year old.
2,"Yes, it sucks, but. but still part of the series.","This movie by far is the worst Godzilla film ever made. That's would often be viewed as a good thing sense what I like about Godzilla films is how cheesy they get (Like the flying drop-kick in Godzilla Vs Megalon. Bad butat the same time classic). However that's not the case in this movie. Thismovie is just plane lame (Unless your a kid and by that I mean five). However, it is still part of the Godzilla showa series and if your lookingto complete your collection it's a must have. It's the only reason I boughtit anyway."
1,what the hell is this?!,"I generally like Godzilla films.They arent that bad.They are very corny, but a good watch if nothing else is on.But this movie was pure garbage!The worst acting, worst script,worst plot for any Godzilla film.Its about a kids fantasy to play with Godzilla, thats the plot.What were they thinking?Whats more, they just pieced it together from old Godzilla movies.And Godzilla SON?playing and talking to a little BOY?Pretty crappy(1 star out of 5)"
1,Oh The Pain!!!!!! Have Mercy!!!!!,"Oh my gosh!!!! I have now seen how bad a movie can get! I mean, where's the ""Revenge"" here people?! What was Toho thinking? Minilla talks????? This movie does not have any monsters in it besides the ones in the boy's head. If you want to see a movie with cool monsters you will regret it. Now, if you're looking for the closest thing to Tellatubbies (besides Barney) this is definetly what you're looking for. This is not a Godzilla movie in the slightest."
1,Why was this movie made?,"With no human doubt in my mind,this is THE worst one they ever made!This movie is so utterly ridiculous it gives the godzilla series a bad name.If 5 people watched this movie as the first godzilla movie they ever watched,theres no doubt in my mind that 4 out of 5 of those people would steer clear of any other godzilla movie.Horrible,Horrible."
2,Godzilla's Nightmare,"a.k.a Oru Kaiju Daishingeki: All Monsters Attack! This movie has little to do with Godzilla, except for appearances in a boy's dream.The boy dreams he sees Godzilla and his son, Minya. Godzilla is teaching Minya how to fight. It's supposed to be heart-warming and funny, but it's just painful to witness. The boy learns from Minya to be courageous and resourceful and, in doing so, defeats a pair of foolish criminals. It's sorta like Home Alone, without Joe Pesci or M Culkin -- and it's hard to sit through this one, even for Godzilla fans.Here's what you need to know:Godzilla's Revenge has gained distinction by being ranked as one of the worst films of all time for its shameless use of stock footage. The new footage consists of a fight with Giberah, but this new kaiju is lame and looks hastily produced. Not enough Godzilla, too much Minya. One star seems harsh, so...two stars for you, Minya."
2,Godzilla's Revenge,Godzilla's Revenge was not a good Godzilla movie. He did not come to destroy the city and they did not show much of Godzilla. This movie was very boring. The only thing good about this movie was Godzilla's son. I would never spend my money to buy this.
1,"Godzilla as, Barney?","Well, almost. This movie is definitly geared towards younger audiences. Most of the fight scenes are stock footage from other films, the plot is kiddy and the dubbing is worse then usual. There are two reasons to get this movie. One, if you are a Godzilla fan and want to introduce your children to the series, this is a good way to do it. This is a great way to spend some quality time with your child and maybe pass on some of what you like about the Godzilla series. The other reason? If your a collector or completionist, buy the video, watch it once and bury it on a deep shelf. Every self proclaimed Godzilla fan should have to watch this video once. It reminds us that Godzilla is for all ages. And it shows that maybe the American Godzilla wasn't that bad. After all, it could have been based on this."
2,Ranks alongside most Saturday morning cartoons.,"Summary: Godzilla and Son help show a little kid how to stand up for himself.Certainly the most different of all Godzilla's films. Although this one is directly aimed at audience members around the age of 5, it is not all bad. The immortal ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"" is much worse.Next is ""Godzilla Vs. the Smog Monster""."
4,Not a Godzilla movie.,"My opinion is that this was not a movie about Godzilla, but rather a movie about a kid who watches Godzilla movies! The worst one, but great fights!"
2,Corny but great for children,"When I was a child, this movie was the junk. Me and my friends used to love watching this movie. Now that I'm older, I look back on it and think, ""What was so good about this movie?"" The fact is, this one was more child-oriented, which explains why it was so cheesy. The only thing that sucked about this movie, even for a family movie, is the fact that they used a lot of old stock footage (every battle is taken from older Godzilla movies. On top of all that, they really slaughtered the battle between Godzilla and Spiga, which originally ended in Spiga being burned to death by Godzilla and his son). So, if you're a Godzilla fan who's collecting or you have children who love Big G, then buy this film. If not, then stay far away from it because this one practically oozes cheese."
1,Terrible DVD Release For A Terrible Movie,"I remember i watched it when i was young. So when I saw that it was on dvd i wanted to get it. (remember i was young and i didn't remember how stupid it was.) I thought Godzilla was going to stomp the city. Only in The beginning with some stock footage from destroy all monsters and it wasn't even that long. It was no more than stock footage and poor special effects. I thought that Gabara Could be Cool if He had A Really big upgrade. I saw holes in gabaras neck not like battle holes, but holes that made gabaras roars. really sad. over all poor movie. I'm a kid too and i don't even like it."
1,Toho's Biggest Failure in History!,"I will never forget the horror that unfolded in front of me the first day I saw this crime against filmography. Godzilla, the monster I had first thought of as the most powerful, unstoppable force on Earth, had been turned into...into...THIS!This movie is the worse Godzilla film I've ever seen, second only to ""Godzilla (1998)""! Even as a child I hated this movie, and now that I find out its on DVD I want to run screaming into the night!Don't buy this movie no matter what! It will shatter your image of Godzilla forever! And that hemmeroid son of Godzilla, Minya is the worst beast in creation! I can still remember praying for King Ghidorah to swoop in and devour him!If you get this movie as a gift: treat it as a fruitcake and give it to somebody you don't like, practice your skeet shooting, or just use it as a coaster! But please! Don't ever, ever, EVER waste your money on this!"
1,Message!!!!,"Well i give this a one star because this is the worst godzilla film ever made.The reason I get is to have in my godzilla videos collection but thats it.This movie is about a goofy looking kid that gets pick on by bullies and ends up hostage in abandon place by robbers.Then he dreams and falls asleep about monster island and wonders what minya godzilla retarded son would do in his place.Overal the monster action sucks bad I mean Gabhara or so looks like a mutated house cat.But Inoshiro Honda the director wants to point out a message to kids and families about standing up to your enemies or they would just push you around.Teach you about bravery,confindence and so on.Thats the only reason he made it was for kids.This video is for little kids who likes barney,sesame streets,and so on because its teaches rather then violence."
1,Complete and utter trash...,"This movie is not only the worst Godzilla movie ever made, but it is conceivably the worst MOVIE of all time. Minya and Ishiro made me nauseous, and only a complete jackass could really appreciate this piece of garbage. Buy this movie for a few laughs when you are drunk with your friends. If you want to stimulate even one of your brain cells with some good cinema, however, stay away from this one. Far away."
2,stock footages revenge!!!!,"this movie did not even seem like a godzilla movie most of the time we see him it's STOCK FOOTAGE the fights are also stock footage this movie is more for the younglings [most likely ages 8 and under] and that green pinple but gabra is one worst monsters i've ever seen. but if your a serious godzilla fan or just craven for alot of monsters, this movie might be good for that."
2,Not the greatest.,"There are better products out there. This cart is very flimsy. It wiil tip over quite easily. My biggest beef with this is that the finish is a really inferior laminate type of coating. During the assembly process the edges got chipped real easy. The black lip on the top and bottom is plastic. It snaps into little holes, mine came partially unsnapped.The positive aspect of this product is that you can use as a reading stand for a book and a laptop. I"
1,wrong color,i can't really comment about the item.the vendor shipped me the wrong color.when i contacted him he said that was all he had and if i wanted the right color it would cost me more money.i gave it to a friend who is hurting for money.she said it was great.don't buy anything from worldtraders!!!!!
4,Very Nice and Room For Improvement,"This is a very good product. The shelf itself is classy looking enough and easily adjustable. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. My only suggestion for improvement, just in case any manufacturer is reading this, is to make the base a lower profile, so the unit can slip under un-reclined chair better. Perhaps they could rearrange the base's configuration, so as to make it more agile around the usual chair/furniture obstacles. Not sure how, but anyway, great product."
3,Pretty Good But Not the Best,"I liked it okay, but too much candied fruit. Try Dinkel's Bakery - much fresher and tastier! You can find them online."
5,Steak Knives That Make The Cut!,"Highly recommended; nicely weighted and ergonomically-shaped with high quality blades and beautiful wood handles and presentation/storage box. The only negative is that the knives should be hand-washed and never put in dishwasher to preserve the wood handles, but that's a small price to pay for such beautiful and well-made steak knives. I lucked out and bought two sets (total 8 knives)at Marshall's for less than the price of one set on Amazon."
4,Modest Beginning - Good Potential,"There are certain points in the story and art that it becomes obvious where the inspirations came from, but aside from that, the novel is solid. Aldrich delivers new ideas and shines the light on old ideas that people have forgotten. And I believe there's going to be a lot more twists along the way! There's many hidden shout outs that Aldrich makes to legendary pastimes, and I believe only true geeks and nerds will be able to see them. Which is a breath of fresh air for a self-proclaimed geek such as myself! If you like action. If you like suspense. If you like creative spins on time-proven ideas . . . then you'll love the Crossworld saga!"
1,Would not use this product for security,"I have had the bar for less than a week and will no longer use it in my home. The bar collapses when put in place and any amount of pressure is applied. The pin that attaches the two bar pieces gives way under the slightest pressure. Another reviewer had the same problem with the pin as I did. If the bar collapses when I am putting it in place, there is no reason to believe it will be of any use if someone tries to get into the home. I would not trust this product to help protect my family."
1,Does not work! Burglars kicked in door!!!!!,"Earlier today my back door was kicked in by burglars with the bar on it! I check and make sure the look is secure every night Before I go to sleep and before I leave out. Nevertheless, ten minutes after I left this morning, my back door was kicked in while my teenage daughter was there. My daughter said they kicked in the door with one powerful kick. The responding police stated that this bar would not have stopped them from kicking in the door. This bar is a false sense of security and a waste of money. What eventually stopped them was my dogs and my alarm. THIS BAR IS A JOKE! I WANT A REFUND!"
4,OK and working,"Just once needed this far, to lock the bedroom door for having sex without children disturbing. Quick and easy.I have not yet much experience, so don't trust me too muct."
1,POS,Flimsy and the rubber piece at the bottom won't stick to the floor. No leverage can be gained so it just slides around! Do not waste your money. I am serious.
5,great,"Bought this when I moved into my new apartment because the second my mom saw the sliding glass door, she was not happy. I bought this so she'd stop bothering me, but it is a good product. I try pushing the door open and it wont budge. :)"
2,Not Good for Speciality Doors,Design is good but if you have a custom door know lock set the u-shape end for the door knob end will not fit door knob properly and tightly.
2,door jammer,"I purchased 3 of these, i really have not used them as of yet. I do know they are not as good as they say it should be. It has a hard time staying on the rug when opening the door,'it slides' Also if you have a wave door knob it will NOT fit under it. 'I guess it would be ok for a hotel room"" ??"
2,Can't even survive Shipping...,"I ordered two of these. One arrived intact while the other was broken at the top. Top piece is made of plastic and broke in half before even being delivered. I installed the other one but don't have much faith in it, didn't give me the piece of mind I was looking for."
1,no match for a crowbar,"A few weeks ago, someone broke into out house by kicking in the door. We made improvements to the door locks and got one of these ""security bars"" . The door did seem stable and secure with it attached. We gave the new door, a few quick (but not very hard kicks) and it did not budge or quiver. We felt more secure. Alas, the burglars came back last night with a crow bar. We found the bar laying amid the door/frame wreckage. It might have slowed them down a little but obviously did not stop them. Cop said we should replace it with the kind that hooks into the floor"
4,Robust anti theft device,The device arrived promptly from Amazon. I am pleased to see it is made of sturdy materials. It is best used as a brace against doors being forcibly pushed in. For sliding doors get a broomstick handle. The metal brace is adjustable and I believe gives one the best protection if used with the the foot placed no more than 12 inches from the door. Highly recommended.
4,Product was as advertised!,The Master Lock was as it was described. Add a Glock 19 to it and it makes a very nice security system.
4,No attention,"The product works just fine, but one bar came damaged and no response from the company to send a new part or replace."
3,didn't work for me,"This bar it certainly sturdy and substantially built, but unfortunately it would not hold on the floor. We have vinyl tiles and this just slipped, no hold at all. It has a pretty good range of length adjustment but wouldn't adjust long enough to reach across to the other side of the hall to hold that way, so we returned it. I would think it would work best on carpet."
5,Master lock security bar,We feel much safer now that we are using the Master Lock Dual Function Security Bar in our doors and windows. It is very easy to use. Product was delivered on time and in perfect condition.Master Lock 265DCCSEN Dual-Function Security Bar
3,"Functional, but far from the best","The price is right, and it will provide at least a moderate barrier to entry. However, the build quality is not something to bet your life on. I didn't expect the best for this price, and I didn't get the best."
1,Broke on the first use!,This security pole fell over and broke the first time we tried to use it.Don't waste your money!
