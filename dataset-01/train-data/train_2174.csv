4,Great product!,"I've used the spray as well as the gel now and they both work great, I can totally see a difference in my dogs' teeth. The amount of plaque has decreased and their teeth look whiter. They weren't too keen on the spray but the gel is pretty easy to get in their mouths when I put it on my finger first and then rub it on their teeth or gums (or whatever I can get to in the 1.4738 seconds until they get away from me). I recommend it!"
1,"works, but is it safe?!?","After using this product on my dog's teeth for a month, I noticed that my dog's teeth were getting cleaner. But then I brought her to the vet and I found out that she lost 10% of her body weight in the month since starting this regimen. I immediately stopped using this product because I am very worried about my dog's health. After doing more research, I found out that since it contains grain alcohol, other owners have reported that their dogs have had major damage done to their liver as a result of using this product. I would recommend against anyone using this product if they want to keep their dog healthy."
5,Works Great -- Worth the Money!!,"This product does what it claims and is worth the money!! I have two dogs in their senior years. One absolutely hates to have her teeth brushed and gives me a very hard time so I was desperate to find something to help. This product is easy to use, works great, and makes me feel confident I'm promoting good oral hygiene for my dogs. While I still continue with my dogs' teeth brushing routine, this gel provides the extra boost they need and the peace of mind I need."
1,"Good album, bad rip from Amazon","The 1 star is solely because of Amazon's terrible rip of this album. The mp3 album is ripped with incorrect track lengths, so the first track is actually longer than Amazon's track... so it REALLY ends in the middle of track 2, and it's like this for the whole album.Whatever you do, DON'T BUY THIS FROM AMAZON! It's broken and there's no way to fix it yourself without transcoding and ruining the quality."
1,A Metallica wanna-be stuck in 80s,"Basically this is it. The sound is too mundane, though polished. Lyrics will not blow your mind and the music is not catchy. I bought it on sale for $3 and it still wasn't worth it."
1,Nightmarish EXAMPLE!,"DO NOT BUY! This book could frighten any child! As a Dental Hygienist with over 25 years experience, I do not recommend this book. Brother Bear taunts Sister about her upcoming dental appointment. THEN she has a tooth pulled!A MUCH BETTER CHOICE: ""Show Me Your Smile!"" A Nick Kids book about DORA the Explorer. It takes Dora through her visit to the dentist with very positive words and pictures, and EVERYONE loves Dora!"
5,Great book,"I bought this book because my 4-year-old loves the Berenstain Bears and disliked dentist visits. The book has served as a great introduction to dentists visits in general, and eventually will hopefully also help when that first cavity comes along."
4,Well - written,"I read this book with my 3-year-old granddaughter before her first dental appointment. It did help! Well-explained the tools that would be there in the office, the chair, etc"
5,Wonderful!,"The world lost a real gem of a writer when Stan Berenstain passed on November 29. Together, Berenstain and his wife, Jan, and eventually their two sons, created books featuring lovable but flawed characters who tackle just about every real issue that faces families.Going to the dentist is something that most kids (and adults!) fear. And why not? It's invasive, uncomfortable, and sometimes painful to have someone poking around in your mouth with metal objects. However, it's necessary, and having a healthy attitude about it will promote lifelong oral health. This book is a great place to start if you're looking to help alleviate your child's fear about going to the dentist. It'll help open up a dialogue about your kid's fears and help you to explain why the dentist is so important. Wonderful!"
5,Short stories with surprise endings,"This is great little volume of 16 short stories, all which have a surprise or a twist at the end. Usually the villain gets their comeuppance or a misunderstanding leads to the hero winning the day. I recommend this book highly for those who like their reading in small batches; I just wish Lovesey would write a few more batches of stories."
3,crude but informative,"This books' illustrations are crude and unimpressive. So is the writing which attempts to rhyme pleasantly but fails. HOWEVER, I learned what the different types of cars are called and what roles they provide behind the engine. I've enjoyed talking about that with my son (20 mos) who LOVES trains. I don't read the text to my son--I just improvise and point things out. You would do better to learn some interesting facts about trains and get a different book. I highly recommend ""chugga-chugga choo-choo"" by Kevin Lewis with pictures by Daniel Kirk. I got it at the same time and it is a BIG hit. And by the way ""chugga-chugga choo-choo"" by Kevin Lewis is also an excellent bedtime story. It starts out exciting and active like ""good night moon"" and slows down and the illustrations become calmer and darker at the end when everyone goes to sleep after the big day."
3,I loved it but...,"I bought this book for my three-year old nephew, who is a serious train-lover. I was delighted with the simple, rhyming text and the comparison of the different uses of engines. i was, however, a little taken aback by the page that depicts what appears to be an American missile (too small to be a spaceship)on a journey to a destination unknown. The description of ""secret stuff that's under wrap"" also made me think of a weapon. I felt really uncomfortable giving this to my nephew, and ultimately decided not to. An almost perfect book! It was a shame."
3,missing pages.......,I was very disappointed when I received this book for my 3 year old son in the mail because a page was missing at the book! We had read this book before when we borrowed it from our local library so I knew when there was a break in the rhythm of the story there was a problem. Sure enough I took a closer look and a page was ripped out!!! Very frustrating for my 3 year old and myself!
5,My toddler loved it!,"Trains, Trains, Trains - I love trains! My little guy loves this book. After only a few weeks he can't wait to turn the page and ""read"" the next part. My only note is that these are soft pages and not a board book (which I knew before I purchased) but it might not be suitable for little kids who have not graduated to being gentle with their books yet."
3,Metal buckle too heavy,"Well made but the design is more appropriate for a solid body guitar. If not very careful on taking the guitar off, the buckle will knock into the face of a larger acoustic guitar. Thought about returning it but decided to use it solely on my strat."
2,Don't Go to new Comic Shops and Don't Read This Book,Okay your this kid who goes in a comic shop and you touch this rack and turn into a comic or you can go down the stairs and get stuck in a maze. How about the last choice don't read this book. At first glance it seems like it would be good but it's not. If you turn into a comic it seems incomplet and the best ending leaves you puzzled. And when you get stuck in the maze well the whole storyline of that is dumb. The only reson it gets a 2 is because you might if you tried get a small bit of entertainment but not much and unless you love Goosebumps and have read every other Goosebumps book ever three times would you want to buy this book. R.L. Stine tried but didn't live up to his other books this had so much promise but was only disappointing. Readers just skip this one.
1,Crap compared to other books on this subject,This book is just some guy's opinions on how to pick up women. Not written or organized particularly well. Look elsewhere.
2,Below average; there are much better books available.,"Reading this book will tell you nothing you couldn't learn from sitting down with an older man and asking him about his youth.Every single thing in this book is basic common sense knowledge. There are a few decent stories about Alonzo's life, but a very large portion of the book is nothing more than quotes from women.You're much better off purchasingThe Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup ArtistsorRules of the Gameas a starting point. Not only will you get a far more interesting story if you purchase The Game, but if you purchase Rules of the Game you'll get a concise blueprint for increasing success with women, which is something this book is sorely lacking.Simply put, while the quotes are entertaining, they do not justify the cost of the book, and Alonzo never goes into detail on why certain things work and others don't.Avoid this one and seek out books from Neil Strauss, Mystery, Ross Jeffries, Wayne Elise, and others."
1,HORRIBLE WASTE OF INK & PAPER,"By far one of the worst most presumptuous, egotistical, nonsensical, audacious pieces of trash ever printed. Completely worthless. To say it is offensive to ones sensitivities and sense of decency is being as kind as humanly possible. This is pure fiction sloppily written for pubescent 12 to 13 year olds and those of the same social and mental sophistication.Please don't get me wrong. I am no prude and am all for enjoying the company of women even on the most casual of basis. But this trash is honestly not worthy of being dumped into a port-o-potty at a truck stop.One would be much better served reading a very provocative book like ""Why Women Have Sex: Understanding Sexual Motivations from Adventure to Revenge (and Everything in Between)"" or even ""How to Win Friends and Influence People""."
3,Fun read.,"Well, the book is entertaining, Greg Alonzo is the man. Most of this is stuff you should already know, but if you don't, then you need to read the book. The only thing that saved this book for me were the interesting quotes before each new chapter."
4,I liked this one too,"This was a fun book to read. Very insightful. Lots of comments from women, and what they want. It could have been a bit longer though, for the money. I'm glad to see its doing well."
3,Easy Read.,"Light read. This book follows a typical format, the author presents a thought, then has quotes from several women that back that thought.The knowledge gained is not Earth-shaking, but it's reasonably useful.If you haven't already read several books on seduction techniques, then this one may be of some interest."
3,"too little, too late","It has a handful of good ideas, but virtually nothing on the initial approach of a beautiful woman; he merely says that you go up and honestly state that she's the kind of woman you want to meet. Really hot chicks get enough of that every day. I ordered this together with the Lay Guide, and think that I should have just got the Lay Guide."
3,"Fast read, but not useful.","It is a fast, easy read. No detailed seduction info other than that women like rich men. The author suggests you buy a sports car to seduce them, and that you kiss gently. Other advice includes looking for women in the ice cream isle of the grocery store, or airport hotel bars. If you already have a girlfriend and just want to learn how to be more seductive in the bedroom, this book will not help you. It just tells you to wear expensive clothes and such."
4,Seduce Me: What Women Really Want,I'm recently divorced and dreaded the return to the dating scene. After reading this book I once again have a social life.I read at least thirty other titles on the subject and none impacted me as did Greg Alonzo's message. This little book is gold to single person.
2,"Come on, what do they really want?","It's pretty entertaining I guess, for the price, but most guys wouldn't be caught dead not already realizing 90% of the material here. You're supposed to figure out you should take a shower and clean the passenger seat of your car without buying a manual. There are better books out there. Good luck, guys."
4,"Great book for in depth System info, needs info for X86!","This is a great book for an understanding of Solaris Systems, it covers a wide variety of topics and features. There isn't alot of tunining info in it though, and it seems more geared to understanding your system rather than changing. One thing I disliked was the lack of coverage of Solaris for Intel Versions."
3,"While it's still a nice introduction, it has become dated","This 2nd edition of Cockroft's classic on Sun Performance Tuning was a step up from the somewhat meager meal served in its 1st edition.At the time of its writing this book filled a void, since there was not much ""out there"" covering performance tuning in general as well as for Sun boxes in particular.Mike Loukides' ""System Performance Tuning"" still hung around in its 1st edition, and thus had established itself somewhat as the grand-daddy of UNIX performance tuning books, but was already pretty outdated. It's 2nd edition was still years away.While Adrian Cockroft's ""Sun Performance and Tuning"" today still provides some interesting insights, and therefore could be a welcome addition to a Sun system administrator's bookshelf, there's another book which should be considered first: ""Resource Management"" from the Sun BluePrints series, which he wrote in collaboration with Richard Mc Dougall, and various others."
3,Focus on a Martial Arts Master,"""UFC: Ultimate Royce Cracie"" focuses on the man who pioneered the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Gracie is the son of legendary Hello Gracie, a giant in the world of Brazilian jiu jitsu. By age 17, Royce had a blue belt in Gracie jiu jitsu. He later moved to the United States and received his black belt in the sport. In 1993, Royce's brother Rorion devised the UFC, which would put fighters of various martial arts together to see who came out on top.This two-disc Blu-ray collection showcases the jiu jitsu master at his best with close to six hours of content, including interviews, behind-the-scenes footage and -- best of all -- his classic fights against Ken Shamrock, Kimo Leopoldo and Kazushi Sakuraba."
5,Great UFC Gracie Blu-Ray!,"First off I'm a HUGE fan of the UFC have been since I was a kid and Royce Gracie was the first fighter I was in awe of. I was shocked at how a relatively slender man, only 176lbs, could destroy his competition! Men who looked twice his size and with patience and skill he dispatched them one by one including Ken Shamrock, Kimo, Keith Hackney, Pat Smith, and Dan Severn. It's because of this man and his family that the UFC even exsists today and it's great to hear from him about each of his fights, his mindset, and what it meant to represnt his Family's Legacy!This Blu-Ray set is loaded with extras, not to mention most of his fight including his Pride FC fights! Definitely brought back fond memories of when I watched it on VHS. It's also packaged as a Digibook and has many colorful pages, photos, and facts about Royce. If you're a fan of the UFC I can't see how you can't love this Blu-Ray!"
4,Royce Hules!,"Awesome doc! I can't believe even all his NHB/MMA fights are here! I only have a problem with the packaging for this set. I feel that every time I take the discs out, they get more damaged or get more scratches."
4,"quick service, good product","The product came quickly, the dvd only skips through about 1 minute of footage, so it made it a great deal for the price i paid !!!!!"
5,Teaches you how it all started!,This is a great buy for the ultimate UFC fan. My husband loves UFC and got me watching it. I never understood a lot of the backround story but after watching this it really gives you the info you want. Royce Gracie was one of the first and the best. It is a must buy!
5,read on,"this is a great collection of comic stuff from some of your favorite comedians like michal j fox from family ties, jackie gleason from the honeymooners,abbot and costllo from whos on first just to name a few a great buy for somethig you will watch over and over and over again."
4,"Right Parts, given time...","The parts were correct and worked fine...pictures would have been nice, but found images on other sites with the same part numbers. Shipping was a little slower than preferred though...took 3-4 days to even ship out from their end. Ironically I found the parts in the grass a few weeks later, so now I have spares. ;)"
3,"Like the product, hate the taste","I like everything about this product except for the taste. It seems that the manufacturers were trying to overpower the beeswax smell/flavor with something else, which was a mistake because what they used to mask it was much, much worse. It would have been better if left alone.I like the subtle color of the product and the smoothing job it does on my lips. It tends to stay on for at least three hours, so if I didn't have such a visceral reaction to the way it tastes I would be able to give it five stars."
5,THE best!!,I absolutely ADORE this lip balm! I have perpetually chapped lips so I live with lip balm on. I've tried many brands and nothing matches the quality of this balm. Even Burt's doen't compare. I also love that this is all natural. Who wants to eat chemicals after all? It feels so silky and smells wonderful. I am a customer for life!
3,Laced/Unlaced?,"I thought it was CD from Trisol but...It's Trisol and IronD. Russian Copy. CD case is almost broken.But I'm happy. Tracks aren't broken, booklet is inside. This is good."
4,"Just so you know, this is classical music","It's good classical music. But you have to pay attention to who wrote the songs on the first cd. I didn't, and was more than a little suprised by what I heard."
3,Good Price- Verify needed!,"Great Price! Before you order, make sure to check with vendor whether this is what you want. This product does not support DVI and it may not have the DVI connector as in the photo posted- Getting a litle bit technical! If it has DVI port, you could connect 2 monitors at the same time."
3,Hot Handle,I like the way this scrapes however if you leave the spoon in the pan the handle which is metal will heat up and you can burn your hand. Not a very good design.
1,Deceptively packaged,"While you'd expect a compilation of Marivn Gaye's best studio tracks, this is not what you get with this CD. It contains, with few exceptions, live footage in suboptimal sound quality... which are by no means essential. There is nothing wrong with a good live recording, but the one-page booklet doesn't even identify the venue or date of recording.This CD does not live up to the high standard that the early ""Mastercuts"" compilations - those dedicated to musical genres - have set."
1,Do Not Buy This CD!,Instead of being what it's packaged to represent (a collection of Marvin's Hits) it is actually a collection of LIVE recordings of Marvin's Hits and NO WHERE ON THE PACKAGE does it reveal this item to you! It also has very poor sound quality. I would not recommend it to any one. It doesn't even list the venues or dates where these recordings were made.
3,Beautiful skin requires more than a cream,"The Wrinkle Cure is a fine introduction for someone who has never heard of the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables. However, the author is unaware of a vast amount of information currently available on herbal skin care.For example, Oriental beauties are famous for flawless, ageless skin. They drink green tea--not only valuable as an anti-cancer food but also rich in polyphenols, antioxidents and nutrients for skin. You can drink it to help reverse aging and spray it on topically to help reverse sun damage.The wrinkle book offers a simple beginning approach to an important subject. We hope the author continues with additional work. I also recommend health/beauty books such as Personal Renewal and Asian Health Secrets, written by an herbalist who is expert in eastern and western natural remedies."
2,irritated to have spent money on this book...,"This book may have some helpful (albeit obvious) suggestions, however I found myself becoming more and more irritated with every page I read...This book seems like a 200 page advertisement for Dr. Perricone's products..."
5,Very Informative and Helpful,"This is a great book. It is easy to read, very informative, and the ""cures"" (at least the ones that I've tried) actually work. It contains information about the strengths and weakenesses of various types of skin, and how antioxidants can help. The author also gives the names of some skin care products that include antioxiodants. Okay, so he also recommends his own products in that list. I'm not offended by the self promotion. However, I did visit the author's web site and found the prices for his products to be very high. Later, I surfed the web, found a few web sites about making your own face creams and lotions, and tried adding the antioxidants to these concoctions. I experienced visible improvement of my skin after only a few days. My experience with my home made antioxidant face cream is consistent with the results the author describes in his book. So, from this perspective I say the theory behind the book is sound, and I highly recommend the book to others."
2,A poorly written book!,"I applauded Dr. Perricone's efforts in writing this book. However, I was shocked to see how poorly the book was written for a person of his educational level, an M.D? Some Page 63 has an incomplete and fragmented sentence. He needed to specify the ranges of the glycemic index. That is, what is low, 55 or less? What is high, 70 and above?I'm also disgusted about his endorsement of certain skin care companies.I would strong recommend the Harvard Medical School Guide to Men's Health instead because it is a well written book. Read pages 99-101 regarding the glycemic index."
1,Unbelievable!,"Unbelievable that a board certified dermatologist would push this unproven junk.If you want to have better looking skin, use an Parasol 1789 or micronized titanium sunblock, and the prescription retinoids, there are five year clinical trials that show they work."
4,more than wrinkles,"This book tells about healthy skin, how it works, and what you can do to improve or maintain it. It gives the information on product ingredients that are helpful and those that are not. Don't wait for your wrinkles to get this information"
2,Didn't Work for me,Another of Perricone's products that did not work in my household. We all tried it and found the products expensive and not that effective.
5,Good-bye Wrinkles,"A excellent book on an important subject, if you are over 25. Worth picking up, your face will love it."
1,I wasted my money,"I bought the book, tried the diet (I did eat some carrots...), and bought the products. Not only did I not receive any positive results, instead my skin broke out. I would be very wary on wasting money on this book or the products hyped in the book."
1,"Maybe I'm missing something, but.....","I read this book and wondered where I might purchase some of the products. I went to to the Dr's. website which was listed in the back of the book. These products were so ridiculously priced that I felt totally ripped off for buying the book. A small bottle of just one item was ($$$), and that it just a small part of the ""program."" How would anyone be able to afford this type of treatment? My book went in the recycle bin this morning. Thanks, but no thanks."
5,Hopefully a true breakthrough!,"I'm counting on Dr. Perricone's facts to be really facts! I loved the book. Having some science background, it was an easy read. He explains wrinkle damage at the cellular level and gives a holistic approach to prevent and reverse skin damage. I'm not an eager dieter, but I was sold on the topical skin treatments. DMAE and Vitamin C ester seem to work on my skin.I see a slight wrinkle improvement so far.(using products for 3 weeks)However, I was disappointed at the prices. Small jars and viles, big money! Hopefully they'll be well worth it. I have faith in the program and anything based on scientific facts and knowledge is good for me."
3,"Good overall - title will sell, but could be better named","PBS ran a NV Perricone speaing to Yale special, and it captured my attention because he was saying the reason we are tired all the time (and I had been having a lot of trouble with this recently) is diet/inflammation. My ears perked right up and, like the hostess who interviewed him at the breaks, I tried his 3-day diet and found such a tremendous difference in my energy level I had to have the book to get more. For the basic information, including the 3-day diet and overall eating plan, you can visit his web site (do a search for N V Perricone or The Wrinkle Cure). The book is good to have as a reference. In real-life, he is pretty nearly the lone source for much of what he recommends, and his prices are high, but it's definitely a boon to tired boomers!"
1,Science? No...it's just an infomercial.,"The book read like a paperback infomercial for the N.V. Pericone line of products. He does try to add some credibility by including half-hearted lists of non-Perricone products that might each contain one or two of the multitude of ingredients he recommends. However, I remain skeptical because the quality of the ""research"" is extremely questionable -- too few subjects; no peer review; no randomized double-blind, placebo controlled studies; etc. His ""scientific"" graphs lacked clear labels or legends and were generally laughable. Perricone asserts his academic qualifications, but any man of science worth his salt would have had his studies published in a scientific/medical journal. It seems that Perricone has chosen to skip journal publication because he knew his studies would never stand up to scrutiny.Maybe it works or maybe it doesn't. It's impossible to tell from the flimsy research."
1,Don't waste your time,"I feel like I just wasted my money on this book. All you need to do is look at the Before and After photos to see this. Oh course my book was sealed in plastic so I didn't realize it until I opened it. The only change in these people (if any) is that they are probably eating a lot better then they ever did. As for removing wrinkles, no way! If you want a book to change your eating habits and to maybe put more of a glow in your skin (that's if your diet really is terrible now) then go ahead and buy it, although there's many better books to teach you how to eat. Join Weight Watchers or just eat the way you should. I think everyone should take vitamins but don't spend a fortune on them. Exercise and take care of yourself and buy a nice fiction book to read!"
1,Is there anything lower than one star?,"I bought the books and his products - we are talking a lot of money here - and tried the diet. My skin broke out from the products. I have to admit that I did eat some carrots (not a good thing). Maybe that's what created a problem for several hundreds of dollars worth of products. To put it mildy, I did not see any positive change in my skin. I did see a negative change to my pocket book.Save your money !!!!"
2,An $11 Catalog of Perricone Products,"I bought this book primarily for the nutrition section because I am young. There is only ONE CHAPTER on food and nutrition. All the other chapters are dedicated to topical treatments that are mostly sold through the doctor's private label while he coyly insists how important good nutrition is. Oh, brother! I feel ripped off. I would feel even more ripped off if I bought all of his malarkey products. What annoys me most is that if you follow this line neurotically it's like you're fighting something (aging) that may be natural and not so devastating. Can one EVER relax?! Oh, and every diet book says that baked potatoes and brown rice are good for you, but if I eat them according to this book my skin will be ravaged! Yeah, I'd rather shave 4 months off my face and have mood swings and light headedness and have no energy cause carbs are soooo bad. What trendy malarkey. Whatever happened to aging gracefully and in peace? Someone should write a bestseller on that."
5,The best of the best of all books about Monroe!,"I have to say as a die hard Marilyn fan I have read about everything out there and this is by far the diamond of the lot! Steinem approaches the entire project with respect for Marilyn which is quite often absent from the other books by male author's especially the Norman Mailer book which basically portrays her as a tramp. I kept the Mailer book only because there were some great pictures, plus my Mom rescued it from a garage sale of mine. But Steinm's book is the best. I bought it in 1986, and re-read it occasionally. The author does a great job of bringing out how Marilyn was a feminist before the world caught up to it. Marilyn was an amazingly strong woman all wrapped up with her emotional inner child which has such abandonment issues from her sad childhood that she was in many ways desperate for love. You will NOT regret getting this book."
5,i loved the pictures of marilyn,"i loved this book ""marilyn "" because of the most beautiful pictures of marilyn, these pictures were the last pictures ever taken of marilyn and they show the real true beautiful person and that is norma jeane and the glamor beautiful star marilyn monroe. these pictures show two people one the shy , beautiful, loveable, true, norma jeane and the funny , glamor, beautiful, free, loving marilyn monroe, but it really shows the true norma jeane in these pictures. this book is for the marilyn fans like me, but i am more than a fan of marilyn's , marilyn is my idol my icon and she is real . i reccomened this book to whoever loves marilyn. this is a collectible. what i did not like about this book is the author gloria she says marilyn had killed herself, which i DO NOT BELIEVE , which i beleive is not true, but i ignored that , but the pictures are amazing."
3,beautiful singing but bad copy of CD,The CD started repeating at the 3rd song from end just like the old LPs would do when scratched. Have returned it for a credit.
4,Wintley Phipps voice just makes you believe.....,"I love Wintley Phipps, and especially his interpretation of Amazing Grace. This is a compilation of favorite spritual songs that Reverend Billy Graham loved the most. Some I wish had less orchestra, more just Wintley, but still a fine collection of spiritual songs. The power of his voice is something incredible to hear, and cannot get enough of it! He just might be the most incredible voice out there, and this album does capture some of that magic!"
5,"What's Better Than One Present? Two, Of Course!","I bought this CD to go with Billy Graham's latest book ""Nearing Home"". I'm giving it to my boyfriend as a 2-piece present."
4,More Trigun,"If you have gotten this far you obviously like the series. This is by far the most depressing set of episodes in the series so far, but gives you enough to want the rest (2 more months until the next one =(..). If you havent gotten this far, you should, Trigun is a great series. Despite the group of sad episodes, I still say you should get this one to complete your set."
5,Trigun,"If you've seen the $$60,000,000,000 man, then you have to see this! This one is just as good, unfortunatly it only has 3 episodes on it, but it shows us a little about his past! There is also really cool music at the end!"
3,Great series...bad volume.,I'm a huge Trigun fan but I must admit that this volume was pretty weak. These three episodes were extremely formulaic and cliche. The whole DVD just seemed taped together as filler. Very dissapointing. I still recommend the series in general but I think that this volume could be skipped. It would all be worthwhile if Vash did something cool like usual but he doesn't do a single thing noteworthy. No cool bullet dodging. No cool gunplay we haven't seen before. Not even a cool song about total slaughter. Very sad.
3,"It's not all bad, but it does have issues","Three ? stars. This is a very large and awkward book, but I'm not sure that it deserves the flack that the other readers are delivering. Admittedly, there are flaws. However, it wasn't that bad. I just skipped most of the stuff about Aran Aranson, like I did in the last book (Not Interested in the greedy idiot!). I do think that Jude Fisher either tried to tie things up to neatly within the trilogy or just tried to fit to many characters into a trilogy. The flaw might be a combination of both of these comments. I didn't find it that confusing of difficult, just to reliant upon convenience (oh, we just tripped over a god, lets go finish this?!?) to bring the characters together for the ""final showdown."" The conclusion is a far cry from my hopes when the series started. If you liked Sorcery Rising, please try Jennifer Fallon's Second Son's Trilogy or Transformation, Revelation, and Restoration by Carol Berg (avoid most of the D'Arnath stuff)."
2,This series certainly went downhill.,"I would agree with what the other reviewers said. The writing jumped around too much between charachters, the characters weren't particularily likable (unlike the first book), and the action became tedious. I literally forced myself to finish it. Luckily I bought the book cheap secondhand."
2,Recording Quality Great BUT Reliability Poor,"Pro:- Recording quality on the DVDR-15/17 was much better than expected (using DirecTV) on settings up to 6 hrs (8 hrs was worse than VHS).- Multiple input/output formats.- Slim silver caseCon:- Reliability poor. After 40 days (right after they began replaying ALL the Farscape episodes), the system refused to recognize ANY disc - blank or commercial in any format (prerecorded DVD/DVD+R/CD). Technical support was prompt & immediately gave me an RMA so I could send it away for service (shipping on my dime).- Menu is not intuitive.We'll see how the turnaround is & whether the problem returns."
1,Update on October 8 Review,"My previous review (LarryM) ended with ""We'll see how the turnaround is & whether the problem returns.""Well, three months later I still do not have my DVDR-615 back from service. No one will give me a straight answer and I'm out $331 (now sells for less than $240).Bottom line, I can't recommend buying this model due to non-existent customer service. Philips will have to work very hard to gain back a customer."
1,Do not buy anything Philips!,"I have purchased this DVD ""Recorder"" and it was the biggest mistake of my life. The recorder shuts itself off without warning and then proceeds to wipe out anything and everything you previously may have been able (if lucky) to record on the disk. Its difficult to navigate your way through the menu screen and it also likes to record things on its own when there's no scheduled recording. And good luck with trying to get any type of technical support over the phone. Trust me, this is a bad piece of equipment."
1,Impossible to get support,"The unit is nice looking but the product is buggy. The company offered no support...the 800 phone number is out of service, no response on chat line or to mumerous emails. It is hard to beleive that a big name company like Philips would totally ignore their customer."
1,Absolutely Horrible,The most incredibly difficult to use on screen menu system. Absolutely the least intuitive DVD recorder you can buy. You will spend 10 minutes just inserting a disc and starting playback. Whomever designed this DVD recorder may have run a concentration camp during WWII. Took it back after spending an hour trying to get it running.
1,I tried top and bottom Philips DVD Recorders,"The DVDR615 was better left in the store I also tried the DVDR80/17, top dog of the Philips line. As stated by other reviewers ""when"" it would write a disk ""maybe and just maybe"" it could read it. This goes for both of the machines. I upgraded the firmware three times all together and still no good they offer this online service. If they got it right before the sale maybe they would not have to upgrade so often. I gave up after 5 bad recordings and one good one on the 615. On the 80 I only lost 7 out of 15 DVD recorded. At about $2 per item or more DVDs don't come cheap but the troubles do. I will give Philips an A+ on their customer service, they are really helpful and do a great job they get a lot of practice. I just wish I had not gotten to know them almost by voice. I go to order a different brand because the DVD recorder is in my house to stay just not a Philips."
1,Junk!,"Mine started acting freaky after a few weeks. Unfortunately, I didn't save the box so I'm stuck with the dumb thing.Now it sits there all days and turns it self on, tries to go through the set up stages, then turns itself off again. 10 seconds later it does it again.Don't buy this faulty mess!"
1,Nightmare Interface,"I never write reviews, but my experience with this machine has inspired me to do so. The interface on this thing is so bad I can't even find words to describe it. Bottom line? I never use the thing because it's not worth my time to set it up to record. On the rare occasions I have invested the time, it produced a nice quality video. But I can count those occasions on one hand. Don't waste your time or your money."
1,Junk - Do Not Buy,"I have a Cyberhome CH-DVR 1500 which has some quirks, but basically works.I bought this Philips thinking that it was a step up. Boy, was I wrong. The machine turns itself on & off at will & the customer support was useless. I tried 3 times to record to DVD+RW, with no success. One of the disks showed a title, but when I tried to play, it said the disc was empty. I put the disk into my Cyberhome unit to see if it could read the disk. Now the disk is stuck in that machine (in perpetual ""reading"" mode). So, I basically have 2 recorders that are both useless at this time.I'm going to return the Philips & never buy another Philips product."
1,This unit stinks!!! Do not buy!!!,"I got this unit primarily to record my mini dv home movies onto dvd...it worked fine for a couple of weeks but then started freezing and everything that had been recorded up to that point was wiped out...customer support told me to try the firmware update that they had on the philips website, but that did not work either...all I got from this recorder was 2 completed dvds, 10 wasted dvds, 3 wasted cds(from the upgrade) and 1 headache."
3,rockin' robin,"This whole book was crazy! From page 123 to 140, there is a completely different book! Most excerpts of books are done at the end of the book, not during the book! Some serious proofreading or editing should be done."
2,Predictable Disappointment,"Rockin' Robin is a BIG disappointment! It got off to a good start but soon descended to an unbelievable, uneventful, predictable waste of time once Rockin pronounced she was taken over the scene for good. Rockin is insanely ghetto, deranged & violent as she puts fear in almost everyone she encounters. Chanel seemed to be sensible with everything but her man. Todd & Eryca are both wasted lives. Nelson is a very unbelievable character as he shares his past experiences with his ex-wife, professional life and how he tranformed to the hit man that we came to know. Jiles is the creepiest, most foul,disgusting, heartless scum ever known. He continually raped and caused his only daughter to become the twisted person she is. In a nut shell the book is certainly NOT a must read, borrow or buy."
1,Disappointinged,I read rockin robin and I read she's got issues and I didn't like them both. I couldn't finish she's got issues because it was stupid and I couldnt finish rockin robin because it was too slow. she wrote about mental illness so that was interested but not worth to buy it.
1,With Us Or Against Us.,"There is no room for compromise is Sharanksy's world view. If you do not agree with the conservative right, then you are inherently evil and worth less as a person. His hypocrisy seems to have been overlooked by the many positive reviews of this book, and flew right over GWB's head. Democracy is fundamentally about the equality of all citizens, and freedom of speech without 'ifs' 'ands' or 'buts' is the thread that holds it together. Discussion of an educated populace is what makes a democracy work, and tolerance of those who hold conflicting views is of critical importance. This all seems to have been lost on Sharansky, who still believes the earth rotates around an American/Israeli empire and that those who disagree with him are inferior in every way and do not deserve to be treated as human beings."
5,An excellent case for the freedom agenda,"Without a doubt, this work by Natan Sharansky has shaped my thinking more than any other speech, book or column on why the spread of democracy is critical to peace. Too often, as Westerners, we're told that some nations and societies don't want democracy; that it is a Western value, not a Middle Eastern value. Hogwosh. People want to be free, and free to elect leaders who have the people's best interests in mind. Sharansky makes that case better than anyone, as he himself was a political prisoner under Russia. Moreover, it sheds lights on why George W. Bush thinks his ""freedom agenda"" so important. At the end of the day, it's the right thing to do."
3,An interesting book by a hypocrite,"Mr. Sharansky writes a book that has many cogent and relevent points that are applicable to the world today. However, one can't help but consider how he abides by the oppression of the Palestinians that his country has been committing for decades. He gives short shrift to this topic in his book, amazingly demanding that the Palestinians prove they are committed to democracy before Israel gives them their freedom. After reading his book, one comes away with the feeling that he supports freedom and democracy for all people, as long as it doesn't get in the way of Israel and it's decades long occupation of Palestine."
1,cheaper than a gallon of gas,not a great book...but for $2.50 can't ask for much...you can't even buy a gallon of gas for as much these days...
1,Hypocritical Drivel,"Sharansky's known far right politics obscure any sense of objectivity in this tome of disinformation. The idea that democracy will lead to more peaceful outcomes is little more than a truism of modern times; the real quesiton is how to foment it. Both through his words in this book and his actions in the Israeli polity throughout the years, Sharansky shows his beliefs on the subject: Break the Palestinian will to the point that they are willing to accept a leader ""acceptable"" to the ""civilized democratic"" societies of Israel and the US.To read Sharansky drone on about Israeli human rights is almost nauseating, to suggest that the Palestinians are in their downtorddent stateless state because of their own will is infuriating. But the worst part is that someone with an attitude towards Palestinians which is to the right of Bibi Netenyahu is going to make money writing a book about human rights and self-determination."
3,"Heck, if it gets Georgie to read....","What is it with the Russians? If they'd just lighten up a bit, they could be a great country. Instead, we hear nothing but kvetching from them -- and the religionism so many of their authors (from Dostoyevsky to Solzhnitsyn) try to throw down our throats is repellent.Still, Nat writes well, within his narrow range. And if it makes the Pretzel Sucker actually sit down and read a book, it can't be all bad."
1,Something's missing,"This film had so many internal plot faults as to make it very annoying. Why do aliens needing to harvest blood, who carry little rings on their fingers that give off little green rays still need to resort to having two inbred mechanics sneak up behind victims with a choloroform covered cloth?John Carradine is the cheif alien. Julie Newmar looks bored in her role."
2,Less Than Expected,"This is one of the most boring dance instruction videos I've encountered. I made a purchase based on other Amazon reviews of this product. There is so much s--l---o---w narrative that I lost interest quickly. The dance steps themselves, while correct, are fairly wooden, with very little style. Especially for beginners, my advice is to look for DVDs by pros from national or international dance competitions. From the public library, I've checked out beginner and intermediate DVDs by pro dancer and teacher Teresa Mason and enjoyed her instruction and style. There are others out there as well."
3,Great Buy,"This is a very well prepared video. I only wish it had more than just the very basic steps. It is obviously a tool for these dance instructors to sell additional videos that contain more steps. I will buy some of them for sure, they are very good instructors. I think this is better than real lessons I have taken. I like that I can go back over the steps with rewind, or can do practice as much as I like, watching the instructors to make sure I am doing steps properly."
5,Dance Lesson 101,"Even though I grew up dancing...(my father would take us out honky tonkin') my husband isn't much of a dancer. With a willing spirit though he wanted to learn. If only you could have been there when he took me in his arms, holding me the way he was instructed, and said...""WOW!"" ""You really do go where I want you to""! (Probably every husbands dream) :) Then he starts placing me here and there. We had a GREAT TIME! With a little practice, we'll be all over the dance floor. Thanks so much!!! EXCELLENT INSTRUCTION AND FUN DANCE STEPS TO LEARN!!!"
5,Fun and Easy!,My husband and I are enjoying learning a few steps of a variety of dances. It's just enough to make you want to buy more!
5,Great for beginners!,"This instructional video is great! I would highly recommend it to others, and do plan to purchase more in the future. We loved Shawn's slow, repetitive teaching style. He's easy to follow and feels like he's talking directly to us as we watch. Of course the DVD rewind and pause button are great also!"
5,from a ballroom dance instructor,"I have been teaching ballroom for several years. Often work with couples where one person is better than the other, or one person is simply not interested. This can cause conflict in a relationship.I recommend this video to my students who wish to get their husbands/wives more involved in their love of ballroom dancing. The biggest problem with learning to dance is one of confidence. This is not as good as a private (or even a group) lesson, but it does allow people to go at their own speed and let them build the confidence needed to be a successful dancer. It is also a great reinforcement for other lessons."
5,very good on basics,"I've tried a couple of dance videos and several dance classes. This is the best instruction I've seen. Shawn really takes his time in explaining each detail, how the guy leads, exactly what the steps are. A lot of the other videos and classes I've tried went too fast. Other dance teachers, do things automatically without ever stopping to explain what they are doing."
5,Better than our classes,The instruction on this DVD is better than the 3 classes we've been to and we can pratice when we have time!
2,Too much talking not enough dancing,"They make it really difficult to learn the steps because as soon as they start teaching a new step they suddenly stop to explain what's going on and talk for a while then continue on again. The explanation is nice the first time but when you've understood it and now want to follow and practice...YOU CAN't. There's no continuity. I wish they had done a version with explanations and then a version to practice. Get the video if you're interested in theory, but don't care about the practice."
4,Good for learning to dance,Its great for step by step dance. Its great for beginner if you have never dance before and wanted to learn
5,Dance DVDs,"Shawn Trautman's videos on many dances are terrific......he methodically demonstrates the basic, then the more complex moves for each dance. I watch them over and over again, take notes, and practice, practice, practice. Love them.."
2,Dance Lessons 101,"The basic footwork is shown, but mostly it seems like a commercial for their other DVD's. I am very disappointed, as I read the reviews, and they rated it highly. The music does not seem to fit the dances, and there is no extra ""practice"" music. I think we can learn the basic dances, but because of the commercials, it moves slowly--a lot of time is wasted."
4,Good Start,"This might get you interested enough to take lessons with a good instructor. You can pick up a step in two minutes, but you'll forget it by the next day. Learning steps is simple. Even a child can do it. But recognizing the music, getting on the dance floor and actually dance through a series of moves, takes months or years. Staring at your feet is NOT a plus. Good dancers can dance and carry on a conversation at the same time. People who learn just steps look like robots.Dancing is an art form. Don't make a fool of yourself, just to save a few bucks."
2,"Long on talk, short on dancing","We expected to see a lot more demonstration and a lot less talk. Plus, when the dancers actually move to music, they lack enthusiasm. It's like they're just going through the motions. Frankly, we were disappointed."
2,Very Basic,Instructions are clear and the demonstrations would be helpful to anyone who has not danced before. I was not really impressed with the technique or style shown in the demonstrations of what the dance should look like and the pace was a little slow. Definitely not for anyone who has dance experience and anyone using this would need to go to a good teacher to get some style.
3,Dance Lessons 101,"Good for beginners. Really basic dance steps, he keeps pluging other videos by him on specific dances. It feels little like sample dance lession."
2,Basically an infomercial,This video is a big tease to get you to buy their other more complete videos. You are forced to watch the first 2 minute introduction each time you start the DVD. The very basics of each dance are explained just enough to see if you like the dance. There is just a basic 5-10 minute overview of each dance in order to see if you want to buy the complete video. I was disappointed in this purchase
2,They didn't even do a once-over.,"I spent more time correcting the material in this book than I did working on the exercises. The amount of typed errors in this book is appalling. One rather tame example: 19+15 does not equal 36, yet the answer key assumes so. In other instances, the typists forgot to superscript the exponents, so one doesn't know whether 2k means 2 times k or 2 raised to the k power. In every single chapter, nearly half of all the given questions had significant typos. I would not recommend this edition to anyone.However, if you are an aspiring editor for math study books, then this is a must-have."
3,"Great essays and crit. rdg, horrible math!","I have mixed feelings about this book. I studied the reading comprehension and essay portions of the book for only the day before the test, and improved almost 100 points from my old SAT score. The essay and critical reading components are fabulous, and I highly recomend them.However, I have recently started to work in the math section--and have been extremely disappointed. For one, I think their tip of ""plugging in numbers"" is ineffective and unnecessarily time consuming. So many of their techniques are, frankly, unhelpful. And the most annoying thing--TYPOS. About 45% of the answers are wrong because of careless typing errors on the author's part. It's not only annoying, but distracting. I soon became disgusted and set the book down."
3,Not great...,"I regret buying the Kaplan guide to the New SATs now that the College Board SATs guide is out. This book was made before anyone even knew what the new SATs were about, so there are some obvious things that are wrong with it. For example, all the math questions are way to easy and were not like any thing like the new PSAT questions (which I took this year). I also found several mistakes with the answer key/reasoning. My advice: buy the new College Board guide instead."
2,Save your money buy Rocket Review Revolution instead,Kaplan's essay tips were very general and not specific to the type of writing required on the new SAT I. The book does include prompts to practice writing SAT essays.I also felt that the exercises for the math and verbal sections were not very instructive. I did not recommend it to my students.Instead I recommended Rocket Review Revolution which actually shows you how to find the correct answers.
2,What Score Are You Trying to Get Anyway?,"Personally, I do not recommend this book unless you have no experience with the SAT whatsoever. I got 700+ on both the Math and Verbal sections of the New SAT. My writing score was very close to a 700 as well. I recommend you complete as many problems as possible in the College Board's New Real SATs book and Kaplan's 10 Practice New SATs book."
2,"same old material, shiny new cover",It's all the same stuff from last year's edition of the SAT book. And the test is different now!! it's just the cover is different. Sheesh.
2,Requires administrator access to run,"The software itself is pretty good for its intended purpose. However there are some poor (and unnecessary) design decisions that make it difficult to recommend. For example, this product requires administrator privileges to install (acceptable) and to run (not acceptable). If you have a single family computer, you probably don't want to give your kids administrator privileges."
2,The cut and paste of other military movies,"This movie was okay...Rent it only, This movie seemed or felt like a movie put together by using audio and video clips from other military movies. Far from a true sub is like. Ending was rather dumb, seemed rushed to end movie, when the rest was streched out."
1,THIS IS AN EDITED VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL,"Be warned ! This is the edited version of the movie that originally appeared on ""here-tv""(the gay television station). This version does not contain at least two scenes where Adrian Paul and Mike Doyle are kissing (they are lovers). The movie was originally titled, ""Tides of War."" Another scene edited out is when Catherine Dent's character tells Adrian Paul's character that she has found the letters that he sent to Mike Doyle's character.I rate this version of the movie 1 star for editing those scenes. The original version shown on here tv was a 5 star."
3,Needed a little tweaking,"In all fairness, I watched the movie twice and realized it was the stiff, flat dialogue that drug the movie down. There were some good action scenes, and I liked the basic plot, so it's a shame there weren't a few more revisions to the script dealing with the characters. I think this could've been a fantastic action movie with just a little tweaking. The conversations made the actors sound 'stock'. This is a good example of why fantastic editors are worth their weight in gold.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
3,Too short,I like submarine movies.Here the acting is wooden. The special effects are quite good. The story needs work. Overall the story is too short. It needs work eg whose mysterious submarine was it and what was its mission. The story could have used a few extra scenes.Some of the twists are quite unbelievable eg the way they get the caption to go on the second mission and the way the XO behaves on the mission.There are much better submarine movies out there but this is worth seeing.
3,Not a Don't Ask Don't Tell Movie,"Commander of a submarine, whose lover happens to be his XO are tracking a new type of submarine in the waters off of North Korea. One touching scene between the Commander and XO/lover. Adrian Paul does a good job as usual. Realistic setting. Gay was not an issue is this, don't ask/don't tell didn't come up."
1,This Movie Sucks,"This movie borders on terrible. First, they can't even wear proper rank insignia. You've got Casper Van Diem, who's supposed to be a Captain, wearing Petty Officer Second Class insignia on his collar. Next, the Chief of the Boat, who's supposed to a Command Master Chief Petty Office, is wearing Lt.'s bars in one scene.The movie is f***ing terrible."
3,"Insightful, but not comprehensive","This title arrived on the shelves not that long before the official Iron Maiden biography, Run To The Hills, was published, and the differences between the two are naturally obvious. Whereas RTTH author Mick Wall had direct access to all present, and many past, Maiden members, the authors of Infinite Dreams had to make do with scouring press clippings, newspapers and magazines (and, daresay, their memories) to source this slender volume.And they do an admirable job, although they do opinionate more than you may expect for a biography, and that gives the book more of an 'essay on Maiden' feel to it - refreshing in itself, tho unfortunately not entirely unbiased as you may desire.If you had the choice between this and the official bio, go for the official. However, to get a slice of history, which - thanks to the quotes culled from years of interviews - Infinite Dreams is a winner."
3,Pedantic,"There were some interesting quotes, mostly from Bruce, but the book came off sounding like someone's term paper. Hope they got an ""A."""
4,Daily Injection of Positive Thoughts and Views,Very nice book to help start the day. Very nice to have this as a reference point to refer back to as my day goes forward.
1,Missing parts,"I'm sorry to say that this transaction was disappointing. There was no remote, no carrying case, and the battery cover was missing. The sender keeps claiming that I was told about these missing parts in the original ad, but in fact I was not told until the item arrived, when they were noted on the packing slip. I would not have bought the player had I known. I returned it and got a refund, so all's well now. It appears that jogging CD players with remotes are all but impossible to find nowadays, when everybody but me has an iPod."
1,DIS CD PLAYER S****,"I bought it a year ago and I didn't do anything to it and it broke I had it 4 2 days and I had 2 call the company and they said they'd give me a new 1. yeah so I got the new 1 about 2 mouths later. then I was traveling on a air plane and it just stoped playing and shut off and no the batterys weren't dead, b/c I had put in new 1's a couple hrs b4. It wouldnt turn on during the rest of the plane ride or when I got off. IT ISNT WORTH YOUR MONEY!!! buy a sony. sony is so much better."
3,Travel Alarm shipped with a weak battery?,"My Bulova Travel Alarm Clock looked very nice but the alarm could scarcely be heard and after using it for a few days it was dead. I can only assume that the battery was weak when it was shipped. I think I will like it when I buy a new battery--I just hope that the volume will increase and I'll be able to hear it--after all, what good is an alarm clock that cannot be heard?"
4,Dogs With Jobs,"""Dogs With Jobs"" is an entertaing and educational study in praise of man's best friend. It pays tribute to man's best friend and allows the reader to fully understand the complex abilities of our four legged friends. Although very detailed, it is written in easy to understand language and format. I recommend this to anyone who has a furry companion friend. On a personal note, I have a Newfoundland puppy, my third. Reading of the Newfoundland ""Mas"" jumping from a helicopter to save drowning swimmers brings special meanings to me while reading of the highly trained senses and abilities of these fine dogs. The work will interest all dog breed owners. A very good book."
5,Dogs with Jobs,"Award-winning author Merrily Weisbord and her daughter, veterinarian Kim Kachanoff, have captured the drama, beauty, and sheer determination of working dogs from around the world. Including career dogs in SAR, arson detection, seizure alert, marine detection, and many more. Beautifully illustrated with lots of great colour and black and white photos, this book is an educational and uplifting addition to the working and sporting dog enthusiast's library."
3,Good but rift with typos..,"First of all, congrats for finally getting a book out on Combustion, discreet's amazing motion graphic software. The book covers the surface on many of the software's features. I ordered this for my class's textbook for supplimental lessons at home. However, the tutorials are filled with many typos that would only be caught by people that would know what they are doing and easily found confusing for beginners. The typos have stopped my class in their tracks at home trying to decypher what the next possible step could be, as the book keeps misleading them with incorrect instruction. There are video tutorials of the book's projects on the accompanying cd that demystify the errors but I feel they should've got the printed instructions correct as well. Good book, just watch your step."
2,"Rushed to market, stuck in neutral","I ordered this book as a primary text for an intro c*3 class, and I am dissappointed at the large number of typos and poor explanations of steps and procedures. There are many places where in a given tutorial, the instructions do not match to what is required; this left my students forced to guess on how to proceed.I understand and appreciate the publisher trying to be the first to market, but jeez... have someone actually go thru the exercises with the book at hand! Assuming that all is well has cost my students lots of wasted effort."
4,So far so good,"I just started going through the book I haven't obviously been all the way through it yet. but I am already learning more about combustion than I knew before . so, so far so good. I think the book breaks things down pretty good to get a good understanding from what I have read so far. I would recommend it to someone who is new to it and would like to experience what combustion can do."
2,Not the greatest book on combustion.,"There are better books on Combustion, but if you can get a used version with the CD for less than $5.00 do it. It does have some good examples. The book has been edited poorly and does contain some mistakes. Still one should be able to follow it without to much trouble."
5,Do yourself a favor and get it!,"At first I was skeptical. Firgerprint reader at this price?I took a chance and am very pleased. The fingerprint reader alone is worth the price, let alone the addition of the wireless optical mouse.The fingerprint reader works really well. It's easy to make it remember your accounts and passwords. It's also very fast. No more frustrations in trying to keep up with an ever increasing number of passwords."
5,MSFT Fingerprint Reader/Mouse Combo,"Glad I bought it; works great. Pretty intuitive. Play with it for 15 minutes and you've got it figured out. Running XP Home, I found it was unnecessary to install the included mouse driver. Negatives: NOWHERE - not in/on the box or the manual -do the geniouses at MSFT tell you that the FP reader is also the receiver for the mouse, so you look for a separate receiver in the box and assume it is missing. (Yes, you may put the reader on one side of the keyboard and the mouse on the other.) If you have several screen names with the same ISP, you must use the same password for all of them."
1,"Unreliable, Problems with security and info","I have this reader and the APC Bio-something. And the APC is sooo much better. I find myself teaching this reader my password 9 times out of 10, and using it only shortly after. Perhaps a software issue. Either way, you shouldn't have to think about it. The APC, I am never worrying about...I know it's there and ready. Too late to return this - but beware."
2,Okay but Flimsy,This ipod charger worked fine but the parts seem very delicate. Whenever I have to change the adapter I'm always afraid that I'm going to break something. I would suggest using a higher quality american charger and simply using a foreign adapter.
1,Technical error in the USB output voltage description,The product specification indicates that the USB output voltage is 12v.This will burn out just about every USB device plugged into it...The international standard for USB output voltage is 5 volts.I assume that this is a description error??
2,Not so engrossing as a writer.,"The measure, is a book easy to put down as being one I don't like--this meets that. TOO easy to put down. Dragged myself through it for a class only."
5,Best of them all!!,I couldn't find this book anywhere!! Books-a-Million said that they could order it and it would have taken 3-7 weeks. I finally found it on Amazon and it was reasonable and here within 5 days. I have also ordered with Amazon before and they have the best service. I love how you can track your item down to the day it arrives.
1,Customer service,"This review is not for the candle itself, which is amazing, although overpriced. It is for Yankee Candle's extremely poor customer service. They took over 3 weeks to ship my order, and when I called and sent emails, they were rude and unhelpful. They didn't answer my questions or adequately address my concerns. They said they would refund my shipping cost, but haven't as of yet, after numerous calls and emails. Several times I tried to call and couldn't even get through- got a busy signal or a recording saying the wait would be over 30 minutes!! So I actually had to call a different department and talk to someone who didn't know anything about their shipping/customer service policies. Ridiculous! I will never order from them again, which is a real shame, since I love their candles!"
3,"Pretty Good Candle, But Could Have Been Better","While other reveiwers have given this candle a 5-star rating, I have to give it a 3 mainly because the scent was too weak for me. Personally, I like candles to pack some ""punch"" when they burn and Mistletoe, while a pleasant smelling candle, is not as strong as some of the other Yankee candle scents.The candle smells good while in the store and does smell okay when burning, but the scent is just a little too weak for me. The scent is definitely piney, but could have been stronger (in my humble opinion).If you like a candle with a subtle piney scent, then this one's for you. Otherwise, get another scent if you like something stronger."
5,Very Strong Pine Tree Scent,"I have no idea what real mistletoe is supposed to smell like, but to me this has the perfect Christmas tree/Winter evergreen smell. When it burns, the scent is very strong and fills the house. I bought mine from Amazon and it arrived in perfect condition. I also stopped by a Yankee Candle store and sampled the rest of the green seasonal candles and this smelled the most like true pine needles. I also own the ""Christmas Wreath"" Yankee candle and it is more mild than this."
5,"hat for a cowgirl,looks like a cowboy day!!!!!","My daughter loved this hat, she plans to wear it on her wedding day as well as the rest of the days she wants to be a cowgirl would recommend to a friend or stranger! Would buy another thanks Vicky"
5,Love it,"I love this hat! I bought it for a mexican cruise I'm about to go on and it fits perfectly. It's great for keeping sun out of your face, and looks cute! I've worn it to the pool a few times. Seems like it will fit most people bc it stretches a little. I highly recommend it. And is also easy to shape."
4,great for the money,Light comfortable. Not completely solid weaving but you still don't get blinded with the sun. not a big deal. worth the money.
4,Amazing anecdotes from the early days of computer technology.,"Like many computer histories written by the engineers who were there at the birth of computing this book has it's share of editorial meandering and is probably in need of a few more passes by a good editor. Still if you can get through some of the non-sequitoral anecdotes about ""the old days"" this book has some fascinating information about what it was like to work on some projects that would eventually help usher in the modern computing era. This book is a lot less self absorbed than say, ""The Race for the New Game Machine"", but it still could stand to have a few pages edited down as I found myself skipping over sections to get back to the ""interesting bits about early computer development"""
3,Useful & Interesting,Defintely a must read for any computer hardware/ software person. Very well written both technically as well as the story telling.
1,False advertising,"Don't Buy this, Looks nothing like the picture. Seriously!! the box came with two pieces of aluminum. Nothing for around the ford logo and nothing for the side vents, plus you would still see the plastic underneath if there was enough aluminum to cover the whole grille. Complete rip off! Find an auto shop in your area that does custom work. Have them install a grille. It's not that expensive. I got mine done at a place called Hunters in Nashville for $150, and it looks better than the picture."
3,"good condition, not as described",I was sent a different edition than the one I bought. Products should only be sold on the pages of the particular edition they represent.
5,Tiny little wooden school bus that my son carries around everywhere!,My son loves this little tiny bus. It's very cute and goes great with his ever growing toy transportation collection!!
2,Smaller than what description says,"I bought this school bus for my son to play for many years to come.I am sure it is very durable as all of the plan toys products we have. But its size is a problem. Before I ordered it I checked the size and I thought it's not a great size but not too bad either. But today when I received it, I found it smaller than I expected so I measured it. It turned out that the size on the description is the size of the box not the product. The product itself is 3 cm smaller. This is very dissapointing.. Returning it wouldn't make sense since the shipping would be more expensive than the product."
3,Smaller than expected,"Maybe I didn't read the size description of this toy before I ordered it, I don't know, but I was so surprised at how small it is that I hardly feel like it's worth the purchase. I wanted a bus for my daughter who loves school buses (she's almost 2) but this toy didn't really make an impact with her. She never plays with it. If I hadn't made the mistake of opening it in front of her, I probably would have returned it. I will look for a larger bus next time."
4,The Lady of Shallot,"i came across this cd by accident, I was browsing through the celtic music selection, and I saw the cover which is a copy of the "" lady of Shallot "" by john Houseman.Which I have a print of. So I boughht the cd because of that, But If you enjoy Celtic music as I do you will really enjoy this. It is great."
2,"Just depressing, instead of informative AND motivational..........","-------------------------------------------------It's certainly eye-opening, but I'd suggest sticking to books that tell you the facts AS WELL AS what we can do about it; you know, books that give us hope and motivation after telling us about the reality, rather than just leaving us feeling hopeless.Such as ""The World is Blue: How Our Fate and the Ocean's are One"" by Sylvia Earle. It's eye-opening too, but later shows us how we still have the power to save the oceans.-------------------------------------------------"
3,"Good ideas, but not helpful to our children's church","I am in charge of Children's Church ages 4 to First Grade for my church. I ordered this book and was not satisfied with it. It seemed to have some great ideas ,but they were not organized in a way that we could use it easily. For example: it had several ideas on ways to greet the children all together on 4 pages. We needed lessons with a story, a craft, a worksheet, a game etc. all organized together."
2,Mechanical Problems! VMAX92UHM,"I bought this screen in late 2005, I used it maybe 50-60 times total. When it worked it was great, but just recently I started having problems when the screen would start to go up, it would make a grinding noise. I found problems with the construction of the unit, and also the motor was malfunctioning. Poor quality in manufacturing, plus I could not get a replacement motor, because it is discontinued. The price was great when I bought it, but the warranty ran out, & I can't get replacement parts!"
2,1 hour video just too brief of an account of the book,"I know you can only put so much in a one hour video. Even so, I felt there was, ahem, far too little ""meat"" to this video. Buy the book, or rather buy his new book, The Food Revolution."
2,doesnt work well at all,"Unfortunately this product bombed for cutting my dogs hair, I wound up using scissors again, I was so hopeful they would work."
1,A real loser,"Don't buy this clipper. To begin with, the clip-on attachment (to cut hair at a different height)doesn't fit on the clipper, and falls off. Secondly, the clipper itself does not cut hair well and is awkward to use."
1,not good cutters,"these clippers did not work at all, this is NOT Amazon's fault but the manufacturer of this productTwo thumbs down!!! I had to put one star rating, but it's not worth even one star"
4,Hand clippers,This item arrived as advertised but did not work in the way that I hoped. Not due to any fault of the product but of my expectations.
3,Worth seeing just for Connelly,"It is nice to see an actress step out of their comfort zone (I am talking to you Jennifer Aniston) and try something different. Jennifer Connelly usually doesn't play mentally unhinged women but she excels at it in Virginia. It's a shame her talent is wasted by Dustin Lance Black's poor script, and poor direction. If he was more competent doing his job, Jennifer Connelly would be getting more critical acclaim for her work here. This is the best she has been in her career and that is saying a lot considering she won an Oscar for A Beautiful Mind and rave reviews with Requiem for a Dream. The movie is all over the place and the only saving grace is the work of the actors. They are all superb with Connelly the stand out."
3,Virginia,"The movie kept my interest. The actress did a very good job playing the role of Virginia who was a little ""off"". The story line was really good and I would recommend this movie to others."
1,Leaked within 30 days,"neat looking, but sprang a leak. The colored liquid stains....even wood. I know its marketed as a toy - but dagnabit - I liked it on my desk."
3,Most of the magazine is in English,"I am disappointed in Latina. Most of the magazine is in English. The ads are mostly in Spanish and in the articles there is a Spanish flavor in the language, but it is NOT written in Spanish. That is what I wanted and expected and I am not pleased.I will not renew my subscription.Lucinda"
2,What's up with this magazine?,"Ok, so the tips are great and specific, but the spanglish is disgusting! What is this magazine trying to prove? Why encourage this poor example of language? It's not cute and certainly not proper. As a South American living in this country since the age of 3, it is not cute nor is it endearing. It's embarassing. Why would you encourage this? I read a couple of issues, crossing my fingers that it would change, but it didn't. I was really offended at the publisher giving in to type and assuming I actually speak like this!"
2,Not for Spanish students,"I subscribed to this magazine because I'm an Intermediate Spanish student. To my disappointment, the magazine is mostly English with only some paragraphs here and there in Spanish. Lots and lots of advertising which is mostly in Spanish."
1,I capuleti e i Montecchi,"I am really sorry, but I could not see this DVD as it arrived broken, probably due to a poor mail shipment (maybe not due to Amazon) so I cannot review its content.Regards,Daniela"
2,Only 2 Good Matches,"This show was lame, as are most WWF ppv's these days. The only matches worth watching are the main event and the AMAZING RVD vs Jeff Hardy match, which is one of the years best. This was built up to be one of the biggest shows in history but ended up being just another ppv that nobody will remember. The biggest problem with the WWF ppv is that there are never more than 3 good matches and the rest are all fillers of time. Do yourself a favor and get an ECW DVD instead. They're a hundred times better and you'll watch them over and over again. Unlike this which you'll watch once, except for the RVD vs Jeff Hardy match. Go to a tape trader and get a copy of that one match."
4,PPV for all wrestling fans,"This was the night all wrestling fans have waited for all our lives. The top 3 companies finally put on a ppv together. The best match and showstealer was Mr. PPV RVD(Rob Van Dam) vs Jeff Hardy. The match of the year. These two young men put their bodies on the line for the hardcore title.The Inaugural Brawl wasn't bad, but you didn't have the stars for the WcW/EcW team that made their companies. Like the Sabu's and Kevin Nash's to help make it a possible better match. The turning of Austin to the Alliance was some what a shock. But Austin and the WWF are best to throw something shocking to keep the fans on their toes."
4,One of a kind,"This was a great PPV overall. True, there aren't any over-hyped, popular WCW stars (Sting, Goldberg.. etc etc..) but, it is well worth owning. Never, in my long wrestling-watching life, would I thought I would ever see WCW/ECW vs the WWF. The RVD (Rob Van Dam) vs. Jeff Hardy match is a classic if you ask me. The bra and panties tag match too! >=) Two of many reasons to own this one of a kind."
5,What a comeback from King of the Ring,First and Formost I had to go to 3 different places just to find a place to watch it in Indianapolis. The First match I saw was: Reagal vs. Raven-This match was pointless because Raven ... and he only won cause Tazz interfered.1/2* Tajiri vs. Tazz.It was alright-*** Then RVD vs. Jeff Hardy - great match - ***** Tag Team Bra and Panties match - ***** Inagural Brawl - ***** This pay-per-view was alot better than King Of The Ring but it doesn't compare to Judgment Day and Backlash
2,THE DAYS THAT SCREWED WRESTLING!,"Why did Vince McMahon buy ECW and WCW,the ""Invasion"" stoyline ?When ECW and WCW were still around there were plenty of good wrestling to watch(no Ring of Honor is not underated,its KRAP ANYWAY)At least now there is another great brand of wrestling:TNA which is its own wrestling,witha sprinkle of ECW and a sprinkle WCW.WWE please let TNA live-and Vince shov that money up your A(butt)SS!-Stop stealing glory!"
5,TNA vs WWE,Here's a another invasion for you.Booker T vs Ron KillingsLADDER MATCH:Rey Mysterio vs Sean WaltmanNO DQ X-DISVION CHAMPIONSHIP:Rob Van Dam vs AJ StylesBig Show vs AbyssTLC MATCH:Sabu vs Kane30 MIN IRONMAN SUBMISSION MATCH:Chris Benoit vs Christopher DaniesWORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP:Triple H vs Monty Brown
3,o...ok,"i thought the jeff vs rvd match on this ppv was the one where jeff did the swanton of the ladder and missed rvd and the table totally shattered. i know, thats happened many times but...o well, i guess it wasnt thAT Match. still great match."
2,Spend your money on a better PPV.,"This PPV has 2 good matches. Those matches are Kidman vs. X-Pac and RVD vs. Jeff Hardy. But why buy this DVD for just those 2 matches? There is a lot better WWF PPVs out there, and if you got them all, get some REAL (the fact that ECW has anything to do with the InVasion angle is just stupid) ECW videos. This whole PPV was based on hype."
3,WWF Invasion 2001 [Region 1],Extras Rob Van Dam Invades pauses several times on different DVD players but it is duplicated in Rob Van Dam One of a Kind DVD Extras WWE Invasion Promo.Extras Prepare for Battle Shawn Stasiak does not play from the menu so go back from TAZZ.Extras Aftermath Interviews Billy Kidman does not play from the menu so go back from TAZZ.Extras Aftermath Interviews Kurt Angle does not play from the menu so go forward from Dudley Boys.
3,WCW & ECW vs. WWF InVasion,"The first interpromotional ppv ever and boy was it a let down. The card had potential but the matches just didn't live up to standard. Matches and opinions of ratings.1) Edge & Christian vs. Lance Storm & Mike Awesome - ***2) Nick Patrick vs. Earl Hebner - -*3) Sean O'Haire & Chuck Palumbo vs. The APA - *4) X-Pac vs. Billy Kidman - **1/45) Raven vs. William Regal - 1/2*6) Big Show, Billy Gunn & Albert vs. Sean Stasiak, Kanyon & Hugh Morrus - 1/4*7) Tazz vs. Tajiri - **8) Hardcore Championship: Rob Van Dam vs. Jeff Hardy - ***1/29) Bra & Panties Match: Torrie Wilson & Stacy Kiebler vs. Lita & Trish Stratus - DUD10) DDP, Rhyno, Booker T & Dudley Boyz vs. Kurt Angle, Steve Austin, Kane, Chris Jericho & Undertaker - ***1/2"
1,The PPV when everything went to hell!,"It was one of the most unusual and unexpected ppvs ever. It seemed to go back and forth through time. One match that made no sense to me was the rikishi-yokuzuna match where he came back from the grave to ask if he has any gum. Made no freakin sense! And don't even get me started about the ownen hart-andre the giant match. Totaly unbinspired. Then to top it all off, kane came out w/ a flame thrower and torched the place to hell! ""Worst ppv ever!"" Invasion was 10 times better!"

4,Hot Crowd,"Talk about a HOT crowd! When Austin booted Angle in the head, I thought people were going to jump the rail and destroy him. The PPV is great if you allow yourself to actually WATCH A WRESTLING SHOW AND NOT BE A SMARK!RVD/Hardy was best match of the show, the Innagural Brawl a close second because of the crowd heat. It's a solid PPV, one I strongly recommend."
3,a bit of a let down.,"i thought this ppv would have been much better but it wasnt at all. patrick vs. hebner-stupid match that just took up time. rvd vs. jeff hardy-one of the few highspots on the card. alot of bumps taken. trish and lita vs. torrie and stacy-fairly bad, you dont even see much. edge/christin vs. awesome/storm-a fairly good match, for those of you who actually appreciate good wrestling matches. tajeri vs. tazz-dissapointing, i was expecting a amazing match but instead, just a totally average match. team wwf vs. team wcw/ecw-why they would make a main event in tag team form is beyond me, but it wasnt exactly a horrible match, the ending was so predictable, did anyone not know that austin would turn on wwf."
5,Insane!!,"This album is impressive! Their songs are amazings, the production is brilliant, the set list is fantastic!! AReally this album i a masterpiece!Highly recommended"
1,Not the SANDOZ I was thinking of....my bad!!,"Do not confuse this with the UK techno-group Sandoz.....this ain't them. This is reggae music which I really dislike. There was a group known as ""Intelligent Techno"" in the ambient world called Sandoz. Boy, did I goof. Nothing against the CD, I picked the wrong one, that's all!"
1,Why so expensive?,"This is an awesome concealer, the best I've found, and I use it every day. So this rating is in no way a reflection on the product. This rating is all about the price. Why on earth would anyone pay $34.50 for this concealer when you can get it on Estee Lauder's own website for $20? Whoever is trying to sell this thing has obviously not done their homework."
1,I don't get it...,"I don't understand how this product can be so expensive... I bought it for a friend, so I really don't have any experience with the product itself and it probably doesn't help that I'm male and therefore don't really see the apeal in such things anyway, but that being said, I would wager you could find something similar and much more reasonably priced at your local walgreens.What you think you're getting from this product is 99% just in your head. Your better off spending thirty bucks on something else, maybe one of those starbucks refillable gift cards..."
1,Fantastic Concealer! But WAAAY overpriced here,Great concealer. However this vendor charges $34.99 when you can purchase it from Nordstorm and have it delivered for FREE for $22.00 (I don't work for Nordstrom -- just shop there) PLUS the estee lauder website also sells the product for the same price!
4,EXCELLENT album...,"A new direction for the band. Very good material, up to date and powerful. Deserves to be a big hit and to bring Sputnik back to the tired music industry's attention. Better than anything currently floating around the UK / US charts by a LONG way! But it and play it LOUD!"
5,maybessie,The charm was exactly as represented and it came in a beautiful purple gift box. It arrived within the specified delivery date. I would make a purchase from this company again
4,A comprehensive review of pop and rock 80's music,"The book is a detailed guide of most significant artist of pop and rock music of the 80's. For each entry, it gives you a brief history of the artist or group, their discography with comments on the different albums(including albums that fall out of the 80's decade), and further reading to obtain more information. Perhaps, it is slightly too British music-orientated"
1,Definitely not Dan Brown quality,"This book is a CHEAP 1980's cop and bad-guy themed ""telenovela"". It almost has a Mexican ""narco"" b-movie feel to it. Definitely not a Dan Brown quality novel.The funny thing is that this crime-ridden themed book is written by the neighborhood watch captain in my neighborhood! This makes me feel sooo safe..."
5,What a great Mystery Lovers find,"Sat down and read it in one sitting. Great characters and what a great setting, gritty Hollywood, San Fernando Valley, Malibu. This author knows the area, the art world, the music world, and the underworld. What a great find. Hope he has more books on the way."
1,Just not worth it....,Boring!I honestly never finished it because the writing style made it hard to follow. Unless you actually lived the 80's bar scene in Los Angeles this book wouldn't be of any interest to you.
3,Air Hog Amazed family & friends,I purchased this for my grandson's birthday. When his mom was telling me about it- I was skeptical as to how it could really work. To everyone's amazement it worked and EVERYONE wanted to play with it! It does use alot of battery power when climbing the walls however. I don't know how durable it is yet because he hasn't had it long enough. I do think it was pricey- especially if you consider a second battery might be needed (I am assuming they are available-but not sure). Overall it is a blast-great fun to play with and watch- the talk of my grandson's birthday party!
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I purchased this toy early to be sure of getting one. Looked really cool in commercials and son immediately wanted it. Decided I had better check it out before Christmas morning, especially after reading some of the other reviews.The car does stick to the wall well (even on slightly textured walls - I tried on both smooth wall and sand textured wall). However, you cannot steer it. No matter what I did with the controls, it would just sort of slide sideways and not go where you were directing it. It slowly made it's way down the wall with a side-tilt to the right (must be where the batter is inside it - FYI this is not a removable battery, you just plug the charger into the vehicle).As I cannot see that this is going to be any fun for a child to attempt to drive and very frustrating, this toy is going back. I am very glad we didn't find this out Christmas morning."
1,"No observed effectiveness, whatsoever.","I tried TWO of these moth traps. Neither one captured any moths. I still have a moth problem. IMO, don't waste your time or money with this 'Pest no More' product."
3,Writing Horror,"I had a very hard time reading this book. It read like stereo instructions. It is really not a how-to book at all. It is more like the sole opinions of the people interviewed. Although, it did give some of the most insightful information on horror itself. I would recommend this book to anyone who is trying to write horror in order to get a semi-good grasp on horror. If you are looking for a how-to book, this is really not the one."
3,"It should specify ""For Beginners"".","The essays were each only a few pages long and gave general, basic suggestions.Harlan Ellison's story was surreal, but not a good example of frightening. He has written better ones."
4,Horror for everyone,This book is pretty good. I have been excited about writing horror and upon purchasing this book I read it extremely quick. The book kept me reading even though I didn't agree with every writers opinion (especially that horror should have a deeper meaning or it is just teenage slasher entertainment). Most of the book is informative and gives you look inside many wirters perspective. The problem I had with the book is that I felt the length on certain chapters I didn't find the most important was longer than the length of chapters I wanted more help on. Overall it is decent.
1,Dissappointing.,"This work doesn't provide any real insight to 'Writing Horror' and the examples are the usual warmed over nonsense that couldn't give a six year old the willies. ""How to pass things off as horror' would be a more apt title."
3,just to clarify,"for you ""Litepost"" (first name ""dumb as a""?)....this is not the underground Dangermouse album. it's the Gary Young's Hospital album. way to read."
5,"Go, sixers, go!","Very well produced! sounds really good on headphones. I wasn't crazy about the re-make of Anthem of our Discovery, because the last one was picture perfect. But it is still a great song, so there!Such a Way gets a nice re-do. very different from the last version, which i also loved. The new songs people will recognize from the shows. Vegas rocks it out. ""You've Changed"" absolutely explodes out of the speakers. other highlights for me are maria & blue jean.I was originally disappointed by flower in rain being the opener, since it is slow. But who could fault a great lyric like that one? sets the mood for great songwriting. Kinda funny that the guy who produced the likes of Jessica Simpson produced this record, because these guys are the real deal.**Revision** - This has become my favorite album by this band. It's full of power and sincerity, and it has grown on me and hasn't left my car in 2 months. So I guess that says it all!"
2,deceptive description,"Ordered this album because it was one of my favorites. rating was ""like new"". It is slightly warped. Therefore, the sound quality is poor. I don't think I will be ordering again if this is the result."
5,Baha Oklahoma - Only Better!,"This is a truly fun read - truth, wisdom, and yapping Chihuahuas dished up like so much hot Texas chili. Some daring Hollywood exec needs to option this work and get it onto the big screen."
2,Blah,"I read almost half the book, and then skipped and skimmed through to the end, and I am happy I didn't spend a lot of time with it because I found what I read to be cliche-ridden and utterly boring. It's certainly not the worst thing I've ever read, but it wasn't worth my time. I really wanted to like it because the whole going-back-to-one's-hometown thing always intrigues me (it's so universal), but unfortunately Sibley's characters didn't engage me at all. Yawn."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"I was searching for a book or video that would teach me all I needed to know about skating so I could get into inline hockey. This book delivered beyond my expectations! Not only has it allowed me to get all of the basics quickly, it taught me the all important lesson of what to focus on when I'm practicing these skills. I will be using this book for many years to help me continually refine my technique. Although there are some differences between ice and inline skating, all of the techniques covered in this book relate directly.This book is priceless!!!!!"
5,Ideal introduction to relativity,"I owe a lot to this book. I've since gone on to read more advanced books on relativity, quantum physics, and string theory. What makes this book special is that it will make relativity an intuitive concept. As relativity is a foundation for so many other things, I needed a book which would give me a rock solid foundation. The book made relativity so simple that a child would understand it. And not only understand it, but be utterly convinced that it is correct. I now understand how relativity works about as well as I do the law of conservation of energy, as an example.After you read this, you will want to move on, and I recomment ""Quantum Reality"". It's not simple like this book, though. I haven't found any books that do for quantum physics what Epstien does for relativity."
3,This book isn't worth that much,"Frankly, I have no idea why this book is valued at $150 new. It simply isn't worth that much. It's an OK book, with lots of illustrations, but the illustrations are just illustrations and do not form an integral part of the narrative. The narrative itself is not particularly original and similar expositions can be found by many other authors,What Is the Theory of Relativityby Landau and Rumer for example which costs only $14.50. If you buy this book hoping that it will provide you with a revelation about relativity, it will disappoint you."
4,scary as hell,"great gameplay, scary creatures, if you like games that are scary, withs lots of blood, this is the game for you."
1,"Can someone please start including in their reviews, the actual name of the singer who sings each song?","For example: ""Ooh Child"" was recorded by at least 5 different singers... and since many compilations will use session singers instead of the real singers, or second-hand lesser-known singers, instead of the original singer, it would be nice to know who actuall sang the song. Thanx."
5,Peace People!,"Nice soft comfy shirt with the forever ""cool"" peace sign. Nice fit, nice feel and very nice looking shirt for summer!"
3,beautiful and durable figures,This company makes great toys. They look good enough for adults to play with and are durable enough for little kids. The jester has great detail.
1,Deceptive,"This is deceptive. This CD is not the original recordings, with one or two exceptions. These are all new recordings by one or more members of the original band. Avoid this. Get the originals."
2,Piece of junk!!,"First this rifle is poorly constructed, pretty much all plastic. Next, the numerous safety features of this rifle make it confusing and complicated for any younster to operate. Add to that, a rifle that is very difficult to cock, misfires, or misloads about every third shot. When it finally does shoot, it shoots so inconsistant, that it makes it very difficult to even hit a large target. This is a bad choice as a childs first gun, who it is marketed towards.I expected to be able to just cock and reshoot, while keeping aim on my target the entire time, since this rifle is sold as a ""repeater"", but thanks to the overly complicated multi-step saftey system of this rifle, that is impossible.What ever happened to just having a saftey at the trigger??"
2,"Good for distance, not for quality","If you need the long distance, this phone will give it to you but don't expect reliability. We continually have battery problems and as another review said it has it's quirks. The handset is heavy and not very ergonomic. For the money, it's rather disappointing."
3,EnGenius SN920ULTRA,"I started with two base/handset combos, to use at a small office. By far, this has the best range of any cordless I have ever seen, and the two way between handsets is more than convenient. However, having purchased a ""multi line phone"", it would be nice to have access to both lines - ie. if you are on line one, and line two starts ringing, you must run to another phone to answer the second line, as the handsets are only single line units - not much good halfway across the shop. Also if you have any other electronics on line with them, {fax, computer, another phone, etc.} engenius does not check for line usage {except for its own system} before trying to dial outgoing calls {bad fax or download, interupted data transfer/call} and again you run to a phone to make a call. Not to smart for such a high tech system. Great unit for a single line, would NOT recommend it for multi line use."
1,Junk,"Although the range on these things are good, the sound quality is horrible. There's a constant hiss in the background, battery time is low, and the phones are uncomfortable to hold (small and HEAVY). Also, the buttons on the phone are extremly slow to react. When you start dialing you hear the tone about a second later, which is really annoying as you're dialing a number. In short, these phones are poorly built and designed, bad features, and generally not worth it even if they were half the price."
4,Menus and extras! A big improvement over the first DVD...,"I just got this second Star Blazers disc and I must say the presentation is far superior to the crude production of disc 1. Disc 2 features nicely rendered menu screens, character bios, a trailer, and even a clip from the original Japanese version of Star Blazers (Yamato). However, the picture quality of the program itself is comprable to the first disc -- somewhat grainy, but probably slightly better than a VHS tape. Also note that this disc contains only four episodes of the series (eps. 6 - 9), while Part 1 contained five. Still, if you were reasonably satisfied with The Quest for Iscandar Part 1, don't hesitate to purchase Part 2."
5,After 20 years finally get to see it in broadcast quality,"I remember getting up early before school and watching Star Blazers. It was the and still is one of the best ""cartoons"" that has ever been released on american television. It was one of the first shows that showed that in war people do actually die, which they should still have. If kids know that war and violance actually does kill instead of causing them to do funny sounds ""warner brothers cartoons"" then there might be less of it. Anyways that's it for my speal, if you want an show with an excelent story, go get this, you will really enjoy it, even if the animation is 20 years old."
4,DVD getting better,"The DVD is production and value is getting better. The sound improves as well as the picture. An extra bonus scene cut from the original Japanese version is included as well as character bios. Overall, I think this is about the right amount of production value this series can support. About a 37% value over the first disc in the series."
1,broke,"I used this monitor for about 2 months, and during that time it worked perfectly. However, it suddenly refused to turn on. I sent it in for repairs and was charged $70 for it, even though the product was still under warranty! Sony claimed that the company that I had taken the monitor to was not authorized for such repairs. Yet when I had called Sony beforehand, this company was included among the list of ""authorized"" repair shops. This is extremely poor service on Sony's part!"
5,Great CD,"This is a fantastic CD, all of the greats are on here, uncut too. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is into old school rap or is experimenting with different artists."
4,A very Informative yet Not too Dry Read,"The Big Book of Masturbation is an enjoyable collection of material that is complete and informative. Not a Dry presentation, but Intresting and Informative. Information in this book came form many sources, and credit is given in all cases to the source author. There is also many additional references given for further research into other Books or Websites. There is something for everyone in this Book. I think you will find yourself Jerking Off after a chapter or two of this book."
4,"Hamburg, Germany dvd","Vista Point Hamburg is a nice dvd. It has a long lead and annoying music, but once you get beyond that point - to #30 - you will be taken to all the interesting spots in Hamburg. A few omissions are the Reeperbahn, the mass transportation system of the U-Bahn or S-Bahn and the Hauptbahnhof, the Stadtpark, and a showing of typical apartment buildings and streets and cars of how the natives live and work. Being a native of Hamburg I was pleasantly surprised of how well the dvd was put together. The photography and shooting of scenery is well done. I enjoyed watching it; it was a little trip back home."
5,Best in this field and a modern-day miracle!,"This book is the best in this field for both serious scholar and/or anyone who wonders about the reliability and credibility of the first five books in Bible, especially Genesis. If the documentary hypothesis by Wellhausen over 100 years ago shakes one's faith and confidence in Bible (Old Testament), this book dismantles the very foundation of the documentary hypothesis.Cassuto's excellent scholarship and majestic presentation will capture his readers as if walking between the walls of waters in Exodus. This book settles the whole matters of controversy. This is an awesome book! I almost think that this is a modern-day miracle that we have an author like him and this very book.Richard K. Min, Dallas, Texas, September 22, 1999.And finally we now have a long-waited reprint available! (February 2006)"
3,It's great!,"Laptop doesn't seem hot than before.My laptop has battery behind, so it was hard to find the spot to attach it, but somehow I attached it.It is small that I feel a bit unstable for my 15 inches laptop."
4,TheSteelBandStore dot com great chillin music,got this at TheSteelBandStore dot com for $16dont have a clue why it lists here for $59.good background music for party.. ;)
3,I Was Hoping For More,"My 3 star rating isn't really a put-down. 3.5 is probably more accurate. The overall content and presentation are fine and there's alot of useful information in here. My problem with it is that I'd hoped to read a bunch of stuff I'd never seen elsewhere. But in fact, I didn't find much of anything that I hadn't already read elsewhere. Of the stuff that is here, some isn't even as detailed as you'll find in other books like Setting The Record Straight or Shadwick's Musician."
3,A cute rendition of the classic tale,"This was a very child-friendly version of the tale, and had beautiful pictures. My only compaint is that the story hardly ever made mention of the fact that everyone's a cat in this version, but that's the only thing I can think of to critique. I recommend this to anyone that wishes to introduce their children to the classics without worrying about gory content. It's geared to ages 6-8, but is still a charming read."
4,Great Value!,"Any fan of the Blue Series should definately get the DVD over the VHS. Volume one contains episodes 1-7, and includes both the Japanese w/ subtitle and English Dubbed versions of the show! Considering single episodes on VHS are the same price, you just can't do wrong with the Blue Seed DVD."
5,Little Girl Under,If you can get past the unnecessary showing of Momiji's panties; you will really enjoy this. It is comic with a good plot. The dubbing is not nearly as bad as most.
1,Immature and pedophilic,"I am a lover of Anime but the sexual themes are generally a bit off. This one is the epitome of what I hate about that aspect of Anime... EVERY SINGLE EPISODE (from the first disc at least) shows the main characters, a 15 year old school girl, underwear. Not only that but it generally makes a point of talking about it as well. I'm not against a little gratuitous sexuality/sensuality but showing a 15 year girl as such is wrong.I'm not into that whole little girl thing. Taking advantage of underaged children is sick... even cartoon ones."
1,Where is it?,"I cannot write a review on an item I never received. This item was never delivered to 55 S. Broadway, White Plains, NY. do you know who received it amd where they received it? Please call me about this so we can re-schedule a shipment. thanks."
4,My child loves this!,"We got this video at an introductory price, and my daughter absolutely loves it. Miss Pattycake's enthuasism (although sincere) kind of grates on my nerves, but the music is wonderful. A few of the songs have hand motions -- a plus with children. Some of the concepts are a little beyond my 2-year-old's understanding (geography, etc.), however the video is educational. Miss Pattycake does a great job with teaching little ones about praising and thanking God. Also, the video is kind of short, but I think worth the small price."
5,Great Live set!!,"Normally I don't care for live CD's - but this one was a very pleasant surprise. The mixes are really good and the songs are great. I saw the Smithereens live and sadly didn't have the cash on hand to buy this CD that night. I did order it the next day on Amazon. If you have the chance to see the Smithereens Live - Do so, they put on a great show. If not, get this album and enjoy!!"
2,Some Novel Ideas Badly Executed,"I read this because a reviewer commented that the heroine was trying to go to college. I thought the fact the heroine had goals might be an interesting change from the standard vampire romance (where the protagonist seems utterly devoid of ambition). Their are lots of novel ideas in this book that are things I have wished other authors would address. The idea of a middle aged women with kids who becomes a vampire and leaves her family is interesting, as is the idea of vampires meeting elves, and elves getting their mortal lover turned into a vampire to make them immortal. The problem is the protagonist turns into a ""too perfect"" Mary Sue loved by everyone. Near the end the book degenerates into a kind of preachy New Age goo, full of a badly handled argument for tolerance and a lot of ""free love""."
1,Sorry....couldn't do it....,"Based on the reviews, I purchased this book. I'm sorry to say, I could not even finish it. It was tedious and I was not sure exactly what the story was about or what it was leading towards (granted, I did not finish it, but had it held my attention, I may have found out what it was leading towards). I donated the book to the library, hopefully other readers will enjoy the book, I just cannot say I did."
1,"If you like Sarcasm, Profanity, etc....","I'm in the middle of this book and I felt compelled to write a review already....Not so good.I mean, if you like sarcasm and lots of profanity and don't mind a man having sex with a boy then hey, this book is for you. The author gets lost in her thoughts often, frequently repeats other events of the book unnecessarily, and uses a lot of sarcasm when describing events.If you are looking for an engaging plot with strong characters and a real page turner, I am sorry to say, this is not. The only reason I am going to finish it is because I'm waiting for a couple other books to come in and I need something to past the time. Plus, I am hopeful this will get better. If it does, I will revise my review."
1,I am baffled,"I was really looking forward to this novel. Both the description and the reviews made it seem like this was a great first-time novel. I was terribly disappointed to find that not only does the author have very little grasp on how to properly use a comma, but the punctuation for the dialogue is also done wrong! Adding in the numerous typos and the switching of first-person POV from character to character totally threw me out of the book. I do not plan on finishing it and will return it as soon as I can. I hope the author gets a good editor before she self-publishes again."
2,Don't Waste Your Money!,I usually like books like these but this one was way to weird. The book is hard to understand and the author doesn't really know what she is trying to say. The characters don't stay true. It is quite disappointing. Then the one character that I actually liked the author decides to kill off! Don't waste your money or time.
3,Great book but horrible formatting for the kindle,The formatting for the kindle is the only thing keeping this book from being a 4 star.
4,Fun read!,"I was lucky enough to be given this book by a friend who knows how much I enjoy to read. What fun it was! The character development was in depth and interesting. The story line was a beautiful change to the normal scary vampire theme, showing the incredible depths love and friendship can take in peoples lives. My son also enjoyed the book so I can say that this is an enjoyable read for people of all ages. When is the sequel?"
2,Did not live up to the hype,"I had this book on my wishlist for several months before I took the plunge and spent nearly $20 on it. I wish I had not. This book feels like it was written by a high school girl after having read other paranormal romance novels. She offers no new ideas and as a matter of fact, uses Laurell K. Hamilton's 'ardeur' plot device by having one of the main characters 'heal' with sex. The characters are hollow and the author offers little to no character development.In addition, the editing is absolutely terrible. As a previous reviewer stated, I was itching for a red pen to correct my copy of this story.I would recommend either the first few Antita Blake novels by Laurell K. Hamilton or Mooncalled by Patricia Briggs. Those novels offer everything this one lacks, original plotlines and likeable characters with compelling stories."
3,"Confusing start, Great ending!","I think the first half of this book was poorly written. I had a hard time following a lot of the story because the sentences were not written well and it made it very confusing. I feel it would really benefit the book and the author to rewrite the first half of the book.That being said, I loved the last half of the book. It was really captivating and the characters really started to grow on me. Like some of the other reviewers, I did think some of the characters fell flat, especially Adrian. Cory and Green did start to develop more in the last half.I will definitely read the next book in the series, but I haven't decided if I will recommend the book to friends. I had such a hard time getting through the first half of the book that I'm hesitant to encourage friends to do the same. I'm glad a stuck through it and finished it, but the first half of the book gets 1-2 stars and the last half of the book gets 4 stars."
4,Unusual,"I enjoyed ""Vulnerable"" the first book of the Little Goddess series.The author's style is interesting and the story very unusual and appealing. I consider myself a very open person and I don't have absolutely nothing against M/M relationship, however in my romance (paranormal-historical-contemporary, urban fantasy or whatever) I don't like to share my hero with another gay. It doesn't mean that I consider this type of situations taboo or disturbing, just I would like to fantasize during my lecture and I' unable to picture myself into this type of relationship. Even so I'm glad that I give a try to this book."
1,Don't waste your money or time,"I was excited about this book when I read other reviews. However, I was very disappointed. While a creative concept, there were too many characters without much character development. There were frequent spelling and punctuation errors. This book had potential, but desperately needed an editor. The errors took away from the story. For example, one of the characters actually changed names through the book -- Mitchell Anderson (p. 45) became Mitch Reynolds (p.63) and then became Mitchell Hammond (p. 105). I struggled to finish the book."
2,I couldn't finish it.,"I ordered Vulnerable on a whim after reading The Twilight series. I didn't buy it because of the reviews. I bought it because it sounded interesting. Unfortunately, I gave up on it. I read almost half of it and realized I couldn't keep reading it -- I didn't want to keep reading it. I was under the impression that this was a vampire book, but there was too much focus on other creatures: elves, were-cats etc. It was just too much for me. Not my kind of thing."
1,This book sucks monkey balls,"This book was awful not only did the story jump around awkwardly. The author actually managed to create a main character who is ugly and throws up every time something bad happens.I mean man up. The author just had her calling herself bitchy all the time. I guess if you are a woman your first response to everything is bitchy. (IM ROLLING MY EYES NOW) I couldn't get behind the girl. The sex scenes were glossed over. So just as you got to the juicy part she breezed over it. No Build up no nothing!!! (except a lame 13 year old's idea of love.) I can't believe I paid 9.99 for this. Who published this? I mean honestly I couldn't even make it to then end it was so bad. So if you like casual gay sex bulimic 20 something's and a generic preternatural world then this book is for you, but take it from me when I sum up this book in Two words MONKEY BALLS. ugh."
3,I don't normally read books written in 1st POV but this was an exception,"Book 1. VulnerableObviously a first book. You can see that the ideas were there, like a weaver faced with a loom and a mental idea of the clothe they want to weave, but its their first piece, so you end up with tightly woven sections and areas with a few holes and snags.You are sort of dropped into the story with little preamble, the characters haven't grown into their full depth and personalities and the dialogue is a little stilted/forced and choppy. The plot flows but you are left with a few ""what the..."" moments, trying to figure out how you got to that point.Having said that, I could see what Amy was going to achieve, the potential that was there and that the story WOULD evolve."
5,"Intriguing, engrossing, I cried through the last 4 chapters.","You MUST get through the first 4 or 5 chapters of this original artist's first published effort. It is WELL worth it. Amy Lane takes Sex and Love, in particular Love, way beyond gender. By half way through the book, I couldn't put it down. The character development is professional and endearing at the same time. The descriptive scenes put you in the garden, in the story, wishing for a relationship and home as wonderful as she has developed. I not only cried through the last 4 chapters but for an hour after I finished, truly feeling involved in this woman's, these preternaturals' lives. A wonderful faerytail, well told, well done."
3,Good for starters,This book was good for people who do not know a great deal about data minning. It does not have enough information for people who are involved within this field.
1,Trivial Book,"This book is too trivial. There is no coherence. I found it quite difficult to understand as to what the authors were getting at. However, it is one of the first in data mining and therefore the authors should be given some credit."
4,stans shaver,After one month I am very satisfied with my shaver. I dont believe the charge lasts as long as advertised but then it depends how long shave is
2,Not what I expected,"This shaver will give the same shave as my 3 year old Remington shaver.I bought this model because it will work cordless or corded. This lets you finish shaving if the charge runs out before you are finished. The charge indicator is a nice feature as well as the fully charged indicator.The micro screen cover is not attached very well and continues to pop loose during shaving, and this model takes about twice as long to shave compared to my older shaver.Lastly, Remington does give a good shave but not as close as a blade as their ads state."
4,Another from The Master,"Jorma Kaukonen once again displays his mastery of Blues Guitar, but does nothing to advance Finnish folk music. The title song, ""The Land Of Heroes"" refers to the Finnish national epic, The Kalevala, but is actually about his immediate ancestry. Still, a very good addition to his oeuvre.Highly reccomended."
4,"Good features,easy to install, low cost - limited range","For the cost this is a very good product. I install it, and program it alone, sensors in (2) doors, (3) windows and (2) motion detectors, (1) lamp module. The lamp module are not useful to me, because I don't have any lamp plugged in to the walls and all my lamps are fluorecent (the lamp module functions with incandecent ligths only).The reception of the console is good if you put the console in the same floor of the sensors. But I have a two floor house and I would like to secure the console (the brain of the system) in a room in the floor of above, but I lost some sensor's signal; That is due to the walls and the floor that the signal have to go through. I ordered a smart RF repeater, I hope that this solve my problem."
1,Don't waste your money!,"The X10 alarm system is a joke. Looks like a kids toy. My guess is any positive review was submitted by the manufacturer. Horns don't work, motion detectors don't work, the light module works every once in awhile. The ""seller"" does not supply a phone number and the manufacturer won't do anything except refer you back to the ""seller"" who has yet to respond to my emails. I'm boxing mine up to day and sending it straight to Amazon so they can see what kind of junk they are peddling on their site. This system was made in China...by the night crew. Totally a waste of time and money."
2,I'd look for something better.,"Installed it without much trouble - however, since then, we've had problems with interference from my computer/monitor and the signal from the front door module. If my computer/monitor are on, the light at the control panel stays lit for the front door, preventing arming of the alarm.Second, the other day I had a box on the counter and unknowingly sat it on the control unit and bumped the selector switch from RUN1 to INSTALL. We walked around doing things for a couple minutes before I realized it, past the motion sensors. Now the system wont arm and will require an entire fresh install. That's just poor design.Overall the price was great, but in the end you get what you pay for. Beware."
3,i dont really like this calculator,"this calculator is kind of confusing. it works but if you are taking a class that needs both radian and percentage, don't get this. it only comes in radian mode. besides that it is ok once you figure it out."
2,not my style,"this song just is not my style, gave it a chance because it was free. I like alt rock and the like."
3,"""constructed of solid steel""???","I just received these and I've not used my Mantis in a weedy area yet so I can't comment on how well they work.But I am pretty unhappy about the false advertising. The description of this item specifically says ""Constructed of solid steel for strength and durability."" But this is a lie. These parts are constructed of relatively cheap, light weight plastic. I hope they don't need to be strong or durable to survive! It really bothers me when companies make ""mistakes"" like this that favor themselves and hurt their customers.They may or may not work, but they are definitely overpriced considering they are small, simple pieces of cheap plastic and Mantis is charging quite a bit for them."
5,Worth every penny !!!!,"If you buy the Mantis, buy the weed reducers as well. You will never be sorry for either. I had netting from sod planted a few years back. What a nasty mess but the weed reducers worked. I wouldn't use my Mantis without them."
4,Mantis tiller weed reducers,These provide longer use of the tiller and prevent tine restrictions due to root entwinement. Most useful on infrequently tilled or new gardens. It is an attachment that should have been included by Mantis as a component of my original purchase since it is both effective and necessary.
3,Not as helpful as I had hoped...,I still have to remove the tines to clean out the weeds. Pricey for two plastic cylinders!
4,simply works,"Like other Mantis accessories, this is a useful albeit overpriced product that simply works. I spent a day tilling new ground that had a small amount of roots and grass, and stopped the tiller to clean it out only once, at the end of the day.The product itself is made of plastic, and fits perfectly. The way it works is that it spins loosely around the inner shaft, so that it doesn't pull or wind weeds around the spinning shaft. I think it is actually better that it's made of plastic rather than metal, because there's little friction and no need for lubrication, as there would be if these were made of metal.Simple, relatively expensive, and worth the price."
4,swampy Cajun fiddling,"This was a 1974 recording by the legendary Blues fiddle (Violin) player, but the emphasis on these songs was, as the album title suggests, the Bayou Cajun and Country sound. No city slicker licks on here, just pure down home fiddling and some songs that drift closer to traditional country. Gatemouth's singing may not set your world on fire, but his playing, and that by the other strong cast of musicians on here more than makes up for any vocal deficiencies. This CD edition also gives you 2 earlier recordings from 1972. My favorites are the songs with long instrumental passages such as ""Gate's Express"" (yes, he makes that fiddle hum like a train's a-comin') and ""Cassoulet."" 49 minutes of music, although nearly two minutes of that is devoted to ""studio verbiage and other appropriate banter."" Gotta like that sense of humor, too!"
4,None,"This is well woth picking up if you are at all a Hot Tuna fan. Jorma is smokin on I Know You Rider, and I Am The Light of This World is great also. Apparently, they just stopped in a radio station to play one day and this is the result. No production, no puffery, and none needed!"
2,Disappointed,"I guess the story was okay, but I was sorely disappointed with the dialogue which read like short snippets of a very bad mystery. ""I dunno"", ""Well what did you expect"". Every sentence seemed to be short and choppy which leads the novel to read like a very long short story instead of a well thought out narrative. Sorry, just didn't think it was very good."
2,PJ Funnybunny is a jerk.,"If my 3-year-old were writing this review, she'd give this book 5 stars; ditto for Honey Bunny Funnybunny by the same author. I kind of hate both books and hope we don't ever come across any others in the series. PJ is a jerk to his sister in both stories, and I guess in this book she ""gets even"" by scaring him and his friends on their ""no girls allowed"" camping trip. Like the other book, though, this one is clumsily written, not very imaginative, and just annoys me."
3,A Little Scary for a 4 year old,"I thought the book would be perfect for our 4 year old grandson, who loves to camp. However he found the book scary and would not even finish reading it, but his Mom told one day he may want to see how the book ends. So be careful that your reader is mature enough for this book."
4,"Good Price, Great Picture, but Bad Design.","This DVD Player reads almost every format as they advertise. I am very pleased with this quality and the low price. However, watch out for the Thin and Shallow disc. tray. The DVDs can easily slip inside the machine. I can never get them back unless I open the compartment. This design needs some improvement."
3,Conponent-video is bad,I bught this Philips DVP642 and compared to my previous Sone DVP-NS575P is quality of component vidoe is very dark. Even s-video looks better.
1,Only a 90 Day Warranty - Is Philips Quality Unreliable?,"I bought the DVD 727 last year. Little did I know that it had only a 90 day warranty. Now the tray won't open. Customer support said to remove the power cord and it will reset. It didn't. But a google search suggested light taps on the machine. That works, but is a terrible solution, for what happens when it no longer opens with a DVD inside? Poor workmanship on the unit. Always check the warranty before buying."
1,Blinking Power Light problem,"Seems to have a long history of this problem--wish I had known about it before. Stuck with a rental DVD inside it. Google ""DVP642 c316"" to find out more about it. If you buy it, happy soldering."
1,doesn't work component output,"Works good, but progressive scan and component not as sharp. Component output needs to be set in the menu for the switch from regular audio video output. My mistake on the one star...it should be a 3.5 star rating."
5,Phillips Delivers Again,From the company that brought us CD/DVD technology to begin with - Phillips - comes the Progressive Scan DVD player. This thing plays DVDs from ANY REGION. Yes - you heard me correct.I'd pay good money for a DVD player by Phillips which is top of the line - fagetaboutit - but one that plays DVDs from other regions - for $50?!? You'll excuse me if I just soiled myself.Run - do not walk - to Amazon and order this thing.
1,bad business,"I'm not sure how great the dvd player they describe above is, because when I ordered and recieved my dvd player from this very site I recieved a player (the one in the photos) it was certainly not multi region striaght out of the box. In fact it was not multi-region at all. According to the manual it only accepted 1 and ""any"", not 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 and ""any"", as the website promises. I attempted my different discs any way in hopes that this was wrong - a region 1, region 3, and a burnt region 2 (granted that one would have impressed me if it worked) - only 1 worked. I am insulted by this and hope it's an easily reversible, or at least fixable mistake in some way."
1,Good for 4 months then it dies,"I bought this dvd/divx player hoping that it would be the last one I would have to buy for years. I researched it and everyone said it was great, this is what I get to listening to everyone else I guess. Today I woke up and the standby/off light was flashing, and that's not normal, now my disc is stuck inside, and the damn thing won't turn on, I called philips and they said tough luck, so when I buy another, it won't be this one.BEWARE! this product sucks, and it doesn't even shuffle your mp3's...nor does it open the tray from the remote."
1,Died after 13 months,At least 5 other reviewers over the past 6 weeks seem to have posted the same problem - the unit suddenly stopped functioning. Mine ate my disc and there is no manual eject button.
3,Not worth all that hype,"Does not play some divx/mpeg4/xvid files, encoded with a differnet codec and you dont know which one that might be. Most divx content from the internet plays, but some have a broken picture quality and most have an audio/video mismatch.....the audio lags a few seconds, the same file on the pc plays correctly.The fast forward is vey slow, and if you have a 2 hr movie with no chapters.....once you press stop and want to ff to the pont you have a long wait time....."
1,does not play PAL format as promised!!!,"Advertised as ""Code free PAL player"". Does not play PAL format. What's up with promising something that this machine doesn't do!Contacted seller customer service dept. They simply said ""does not play PAL format"". Do not buy this machine! See other reviews"
1,A dud!,"What an attractive player, so sleek and slim. Unpacks and hooks up in a jiffy, slip in the DVD and we're off. Crystal clear picture, the fine audio through my stereo system fills the living room. Ten minutes into the experience the picture freezes... and ten more minutes of patience and button pushing accomplishes absolutely nothing. Rebooting accomplishes nothing. The Philips Help Line accomplishes nothing. Forty five minutes of freeze frame later the player ejects the disc. From then on nothing I put in it is recognized, DVDs and CDs alike are met with a solemn NO DISC message on the faceplate. What a letdown!I'm glad I at least got my disc back without taking the thing apart.Save your money: steer clear of this lemon!"
1,good only if does not die,Mine died after 5 months.Don't bother calling Philips. It's worthless.That's why warranty is only for 90 days.
3,Good but has some serious flaws,"This player is cheap and plays most formats including divx (with subtitles), mp3 (from either cd or dvd)However these are some of its problems:When playing widescreen divx it always outputs as 4:3 with the result of seeing black bars on top and bottom on widescreen tv. Look for a different player if you use divx and widescreen tv.No individual channel sound outputs (only digital or rca stereo)No DTSSome (very few) divx don't playDoesn't play multisession discs (only plays 1st session)(note that they could possibly fix some of them with future firmware updates)"
2,"Works great, until the thing dies on you","This player can play almost anything that is thrown at it - however I have had 2 die on me within the space of 1 year. Basically if you want something that will last, don't bother with this product. Pity, because it converts to PAL really well and even plays divx/xvid files. Philips only has a 90 warranty on this, so if you do purchase it, get an extended warranty."
5,Plays everything so far,"I haven't found a DVD-R or +R that it won't read. Also does a surprisingly good job playing DivX/xvid files. The only .avi files this player won't play are ones encoded with QPEL (advanced motion compensation option). It is an option that you can enable when encoding files to DivX or Xvid, but few people use it because it takes 3x longer to encode and only yields marginally better video quality."
2,Doesn't Work as Specified,"I was looking for Player which can run DIVX format... bought DVP642, found it CANNOT all DIVX CD's more over the sound is messedup. I dont recommend this for DIVX Player,"
3,The most frustrating piece of electronics I own!,"This DVD player will play almost anything as stated over and over here. If you are going to put a movie in and press PLAY and that is it your are in business. If you care about a usable remote control then forget it. Some super-genius decided that the SETUP button would be closer to and just below DISPLAY, put NEXT in line between PLAY and FAST FORWARD, make the buttons really small, hide time display in a sequence of key presses. Further mine has a firmware bug where if I press PLAY twice (because I think it hasn't responded) then it shuts off completely. Very nice to have to sit through all those PUOs at the beginning of the disc again. At times I want to throw it out the window."
2,Disappointing performance,"The reliability is awful. After only 5 months I'm going to throw it away as it is incapable of reading most discs all the way through without bad hiccups. The remote sensor also seems terribly finicky about the remote angle.While it is region free and the playback quality is good, the short lifespan earns this player only 2 stars."
1,Broke with very little use,I played about 10 movies on the DVD player and then it broke.Poor quality. I am not sure how the newer version of the product are.I have had other DVD players for years with no problems.This DVD player was bearly used over 6 months and one day when I went to use it it did not work. I looked online and lots of people had the same issue! :(I liked the feature of being able to play DIVX movies. I have instead purchased AIVX Jukebox that is a portable USB harddrive that can be hooked up to the TV to play all the movies or mp3 that are stored on the disk. I found it to be a better replacment for the extra DVD player the DVP642 was supposed to be for me.
1,Save your $30 for something else...,"This is pretty much the worst DVD player ever created. I have noticed that the price on this piece of $#!% has been going down steadily for weeks. The problem with mine was that the audio and the visual did not seem to want to be on the same page, and yeah, that's kind of not good. I used it with two different TVs and had the same problem; you get through about 50 minutes or so of a disc and you can clearly see that the mouths are moving but they aren't saying the things coming out of the speakers. Save your money and buy a better DVD player or wait until the high def war has come to an end because progressive scan doesn't mean $#%! anyway."
1,Not as announced,"The review announces this item to be able to read US DVD as well as European. It's wrong. The first thing you discover on the box is: ""This DVD only plays DVDs from the US""!!!"
2,Doesnt play Divx reliably enough to merit purchase,"I wasnt expecting a lot from an inexpensive DVD player, but I was expected more when it says that it is 'certified to play Divx movies.' If that is your reason for buying this player, I suggest looking elsewhere. Some divx files would play fine for a while and then freeze the player. Others wouldnt play at all. I realise some audio codecs aren't supported in these players and I confirmed that wasnt the issue here. All of these divx files played just fine on my PC so something isnt right with the Divx implementation on this player. Buyer beware."
3,NOT the same as other models,"If you have owned this before and are buying a new one because the one you have is so great or as a gift for someone else, beware.This is the same model, but its different.This has a display timer that you have to turn off EVERYTIME you use the thing. The subtitles have annoying backgrounds, etc. This is a great dvd player, but when you are used to the BEST, which IS this model, its disappointing to get the same model with different features. It all has to do with when it was manufactured. Its different firmware.Still a great player, plays all the same stuff, just different."
2,Owned Two: Both Died,"3 months after purchasing this Phillips DVD player it started acting funny. It would be temperamental about which discs it would play despite all of them being authentic USA DVD's purchased from Borders or wherever. More than half the time you put a disc in the DVD player now, it just freezes with the screen saying ""loading"". It wont respond to anything so you just have to unplug it. This has even been the case with brand new DVDs so it isn't due to scratches. As of yesterday, the screen will go blank and then turn to a green flashing screen sometimes when in the middle of a movie or it will slow down to slow-motion and stop responding. This is the 2nd Philips DVD player I've owned, the first was the exact same model and crapped out in the exact same with within 6 months.I would strongly suggest looking at other DVD players. This one is cheap, lightweight, thin and stylish, but it simply doesn't work. I will not buy Philips brand electronics again."
2,Worked great for only a year,I loved this machine for about the first year I had it. Now it won't turn on and my roommate's crappy chick flick is stuck in it :/
4,Slim DVD player and still has S-VIDEO,"I wasn't looking for anything fancy when I purchased this DVD player. I needed a DVD player with a slim profile, still has S-VIDEO and is cheap; this fit the bill and works great. I also gave one to my sis for x-mas a couple of years ago and she hasn't had any problems with it. Many DVD players are no longer shipping with the S-VIDEO port. If you have an older TV with no HD ports like HDMI or Component but still want decent video quality, this is should do the job just fine. It's also slim and is not ugly. I've been using it for a year now with no issues and my sister has gone 2 years with hers with no issues either."
1,JPEG WILL NOT DISPLAY,"This item is a pain. Despite what I had read here before I bought it. It will not play jpegs images, any size, different brands of CD-R and CD-RW. Both are supposed to work. I tried different file sizes/names/numbers etc. It simply spits disc out, indicates ""no disc""!! The manual trouble shooter section, no help, email help..none, referred me to phone help number. They were also of no real help. They hardly knew what I was talking about, and didn't offer to research problem and get back to me. Finally they had me send it back for a replacement, at my cost, even though it's under warranty! The second one the same disappointment. Look elsewhere for a consistant product, one with a liberal return policy! It will play a DVD movie, wheee. I am done with Philips!"
2,Region Free???,"The only reason I bought this DVD player was to be able to play PAL DVD's. Well, despite the misleading advertisement on Amazon.com that reads: ""PAL-to-NTSC format conversion-PLAY REGION 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 any SYSTEM"", and some reviews from others who had bought this unit, mine does not play region 5 PAL discs. I tried different ones but was only getting an error message: ""Wrong Region"". My player manual says that it will only play DVDs with Region 1 or ALL, but will not play any others. Any advise from people who said: ""No codes needed - plays everything right out of the box""?"
1,One Day of operation,"Died after one day. From then on, any DVD would spin up then give an error msg of ""NO DVD"". This has been happening so much with players across the board, that it must be a cheap DVD unit source that the big names are purchasing from a developing country.Didn't enjoy the user-interface either. I use the fwd/rev slow motion type features to watch windsurfing videos. I found the user interface for these features on my old VCR to be much better than on this DVD player."
1,Mine Lasted 5 months.... now dead,"This is a great little player and it does exactly what many of the reviews here say, but it will only last you a short time. I got exactly 5 months out of mine and now it's dead. Will not turn on, just flashes the red light on the on/off button. I had to remove my DVD with force so that is the end of that.When I purchased this model there were reviews that said it would not work for very long and they were right. Hope all of you have better luck than I did."
5,I love it!,"I don't know what DivX is and I don't care. I bought the player simply because it plays DVD-Rs and because the hack to make it region-free is idiot-proof. There's also the fact that it translates PAL to NTSC without a hack at all, which is a good thing in my book.I have a Philips TV and this Philips machine is a good complement. At this price, even if it breaks down after a year or so, it's worth it. I am not a heavy user, so I really cannot see it breaking down in the near future. I just had to get rid of my 6-year-old Apex because it was only just now beginning to act up, and when I bought it, I'd read horror stories of how it broke down after only a few months."
3,"Good player, but picky to discs","I'm very glad and impressed when it plays avi and mpg files right out of box. But very soon, I found something need to worry about: when I put in a dvd disc not perfectly clean (it's the 2nd disc it ever played and with just one finger print on the front side), it stuck at loading for minutes. All the buttons on front panel and remote got no response except the power button. Luckily, the eject button responded when it's in power-off. I was able to wipe the disc and put it back in, then it started playing.It doesn't sound to be robust enough to last more than several months. I'm really thinking of sending it back."
3,Good machine but that what a sucky remote!,"All I have to say is that this is a good machine with a horrible remote. It's confusing and has poorly placed buttons making operation a chore. Considering the range of good dvd players out there, I would think twice about this one."
1,The worst product,"Bought one Philips DVD player two years ago.It stopped working after several months.I bought another DVP 642 last Nov. in Circuit city, it stopped working again. the worst product I have ever used.Waste of time and money...."
2,Poor Quality - Annoying Ticking Sound,A expected better from a brand like Philips. The DVD player plays all DVDs and CDs but there is an annoying ticking sound as you play most DVDs.
3,Requires some work to make this dvd player international,"You must google a reprogramming step to make this dvd player work for regions other than 1 (US,Mexico,Canada-french). The step is easy, but since I have done the step, some US dvds get stuck on the FBI pirating warning. It's a pain, but I scene select past scene 1 and review back to the start. This only happens once in a while.I expected the player to be region free out of the box. It was not. Customer service is no help, they refer you to the paperwork in the manual where it says only region 1 dvds will work. The internet has sources which give you a code to program your dvd player to specific regions or region free."
1,Failure to luanch,"I have purchased two of these ""DVD players"" as I am a fan of the DivX format and have several movies that use that format , well as I said I have had two of these puppies and neither are working, wont power on wont do anything. This second one is of course out of warranty now cause I was to lazy to send the SECOND one back but save yourself the time and get a higher end not so cheaply made DVD DIVX player this one SUCKS."
1,bad quality Philips,"We purchased this DVD player in October 05 and it died in May 2006. All of a sudden it just wouldn't turn on. Nothing, no light, no reaction, nothing. At the time it died, there was a DVD in the tray, so I had to take the cover off to fish the DVD out.The warranty is only 90 days, after that, you are basically on your own. Very bad for a company name I used to trust.Then I came to Amazon and saw all these other reviews about how bad this player is. I know I paid only $50 for it, but wouldn't you expect a DVD player last longer than half a year under normal usage?"
2,Died after 3 months,"My husband and I bought this DVD player only 3 months ago. After about a month, every time we put on a Disney video, the DVD would get stuck at the FBI Warning screen. We had to literally unplug the player and plug it back in to get the player to work again. In order to play the Disney movies for my son, we had to go to the scene selection screen, choose the 2nd scene, then hit the rewind to previous screen to start the movie. After 2 months of this pain, the DVD player finally stopped working all together. It can no longer read any DVD disc. I give this DVD player 2 stars, as we did get 3 months use out of it."
1,Just stopped working after 1 yr 6 months,"I bought this on Amazon in March 2006. I was happy that it used to play divx, DVD+/RW, etc.,. It just went dead today in the middle of the movie. When I saw the reviews, many people complained about similar problem. The standby-on button just blinks / flashes. Nothing else works). I called Philips customer service 1-800-531-0039 and they said my warranty expired and costs $15 to just assist me troubleshoot. We can as well get a new one for little more. I gave up. My old Toshiba is more than 5 yr old and it is still going strong."
1,good product but only lived a short life - 1 year,"It was a great product when it worked. Sleek design, super user friendly, sharp image and easily unlock to all region. Never had any problem loading or playing until last week. Went completely dead for no reason in the middle of a movie. Swallowed the DVD with it. It would've been a greater product if it lived pass 1 year at least."
1,Broke in less than a year,"The player stopped working after only a few months - it would accept DVDs but not play them and refuse to eject them. That behavior started out as intermittent, but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a DVD and never let go. We had to take the player apart just to get the DVD out before throwing the player away in the trash. Our previous DVD player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping. This one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether - what a waste. Save your time and money and buy another machine."
4,Versatile Player,"Just want to add a couple of things.1. If you see ghost images while trying to view AVI files, click on the system menu and then exit out of the menu. That will fix the problem.2. If you have .AC3 files, this player plays them too"
4,Be forewarned,This DVD player is not region free out of the box as it is advertised. You have to find the correct codes on the Internet and input them yourself. Here is the link I used: http://buan.nu/philips/dvp630/regioncodehack.html It worked for me. Use it at your own risk.
1,Technical problems.,"I ordered a the DVP642 DivX player as an x-mas present from Amazon. However, I had to return the unit because of technical problems. When playing DVDs, the color was unstable. It was constanty shifting between normal color tones and colors that heavily emphasized the red tones. It was no fun watching a movie. We tried the player with several TVs and several DVDs. To no avail. The DVDs played fine on my old player.I like to complement Amazon for its extended return period over the holiday season. The box was not opened until x-mas, and I would not have been able to return the player under Amazon's standard return policy. Thank you, Amazon"
2,Does play divx but POOR build quality,"I got this DVD player so I could watch divx files and it and for that it works well. Plays almost everything you throw at it save some xvids that are encoded without ESS support. My biggest problem is that the build quality of the player is crap. My first one had problems with the video out after about 6 months and the second, it's replacement now won't stay on. So it is going back as well. If you can find a different player that does what you want, I would consider getting it. Otherwise you take your chances with this thing. The 2 stars is because when it was working, it worked fine and played my divx files without problem."
3,Plays anything... some problems,"I was very happy with the player when I got it. It plays anything I can throw at it. You can even play raw mpeg files. But the fast forward and rewind don't work right on any thing but proper formatted DVD's. The other thing is the sound stopped working except for the optic output after the warranty expired a week earlier. I still love the player (I can listen through my home theater), but I am looking for a better player with these features."
3,One complete review,"I no longer give this machine a 3 star...more like zero stars. I ordered a DVD player from electronicpalace--it was a refurbished model and I assumed it would have played my Region 2 DVDs right out of the box. It did not. I had to actually look on the internet to get the solution of how to do it. The machine began to skip, stop and rock my Region Two DVDs--eventually it wouldn't even load the DVD properly or set it to my TV screen. I ordered this machine on May 15th and rec'd it right away (about end of May--forget the exact date). I went to return it (had to pay Fed EX the 25.70 for shipping back to electronicpalace). It is now June 30th and I have NOT rec'd my refund and I returned this machine June 6! If you want a DVD player that plays Region Two DVDs. This isn't the machine for you. I warn you about doing business with electronicpalace as they have RIPPED me off close to 100 dollars (the shipping included)!"
3,"More controls, please","I got this player to use as both my DVD player and my CD player. I hooked it up to my receiver. Unfortunately, it doesn't really take into consideration this kind of use. It doesn't allow you forward through tracks easily. If a player is going to play CDs, shouldn't it also see itself as a CD player?"
1,Good on paper but DOA,"I did a lot of research and I thought this was the perfect DVD player.However, upon arrival my unit refused to play DVD's (CD's are ok). I knew this was a common problem and was hoping one of the fixes i found on the net would take care of it, but unfortunately nothing worked. Needless to say I returned the unit."
1,Very Poor quality,"I purchased this DVD player as an upgrade to my very old non brand name DVD player I purchased fo $20 a few years back. I tried to play a DVD, and it got stuck inside. The DVD player would not power up again. I had to return it."
4,Plays almost anything,"This DVD player will play almost anything you put in it. PAL, NTSC, SECAM, I believe it's only output is NTSC however, so you'll need an American TV.It will not play the following: Quicktime movies or DVD Rom slide shows. So, for example, you can burn a CD with pictures on it and it will play a slide show of them, however, if you do the same with a DVD Rom, it will do nothing.Hope this helps."
3,Not as cool as it looked,"The first coupld of dvds I tried in this didn't work. They were brand new dvds too. Almost returned it, but then it started playing the rest I tried so I kept it. Haven't tried to do the picture slideshows or anything like that, but I would say it's OK. Not as great as I was hoping."
4,"Wonderful - Good Deal, Good Product.","I have had this product for a month or so, and am very pleased with it. I have had no problem playing all sorts of discs.The only thing I was slightly put off by, was that there was no eject button on the remote, and though the deck does seem to eject, that function is fairly temperamental.However, it's a great deal for the money, and is an unfussy, easy to use, and very 'tolerant' [-of all sorts of discs] player."
1,Neat until it dies,"I bought this DVD player to replace my dying one, mostly because of how many formats it could play. I like to use Divx and Xvid codecs to make movies on my PC, and thought it would be fun to play them on a DVD player on a bigger screen. Well, that novelty wears off fast as they look like crap on a TV. Whatever, it's still a nice, thin DVD player...until the day it suddenly decides to stop working. I, like many others, am left staring at a blinking red power light that doesn't go away unless you unplug it. The machine is dead, and so I'll be replacing it with something else and recommending to anyone not to buy it."
1,DO NOT BUY! Will stop working after 6 months,I wish I had read the reviews before buying this product. I have owned it for 6 months and suddenly the DVD player wouldn't turn on. I have the BLINKING RED POWER LIGHT! There is a DVD stuck in the DVD player which I need to return to Blockbuster and I can't get the tray to open. I also found another website on Philips TVs and I read over 100 complaints about the TV not working after 6 months. Do not buy a Philips product!
2,An OK Divx player,"It gets the job done for those that have a collection of Divx movies. But it spins very loudly and it has no shuffle. I haven't tested a universal remote yet, but it is definitely a drawback without the shuffle."
5,Great DVD Player,"And a great price. I was looking for a DVD player that could easily be converted to play DVDs from outside region 1. This unit has that ability. A secret code can be entered through the remote to change the region or to make it region free!The unit feels well built with a (mostly) metal case. The remote has lots of features, but I keep mixing up the chapter forward and reverse with fast forward and revind buttons. The fast forward only goes up to 8x I wish it would go faster. I love the dynamic range control. It evens out the volume on movies that go from too-quiet-to-hear to waking-the-dead-loud. I don't have to keep turning the volume up and down.I've had mine for nearly 6 months and no troubles. Hopefully the problems some others have reported have been fixed."
2,Not as good as I thought,"The player is very picky as to the discs it will play. At least three DVD's that play on all other DVD players (and computers) in the house fail to load and play. The discs have no sign of damage and yet the player just sits there ""Loading."" Th manual and on-line help were useless.It's ashame as the player has some nice features... but right now it's relegated to the kid's play room to play teletubbies on a 13"" CRT tv"
2,It didn't last a year.,"Less than a year after I purchased this DVD player it has suffered a fatal error. Now the red stand-by light, which blinked constantly anyway, is the only part of the device functioning. While it is an inexpensive player, and worked admirably while it lasted, less than a year's use is very disappointing."
4,Great features and price - but doesn't last long,"This is a great, inexpensive DVD player - especially when you buy foreign language DVDs (different region codes) and want to play those.Beware: I had two of the low-price Philips DVD units over the past 3 years. They both lasted no longer than 15 months. At first I was quite angry about it. In the meantime I look at it differently.Philips clearly chooses price over quality. I assume they figure that format changes happen frequently and by saving on quality they can provide consumers with affordable units and thus you can ""update"" by buying into the next, more feature-rich unit.It does require your willingness to change your buying habits, though. Gone are the days where you old on to your equipment for 5+ years."
3,"Plays good, but doesn't last that long...","Maybe it's just me, but I think that a DVD player should last more than two years, especially coming from a company with a reputation like Philips. I bought this in the summer of 2004, and it's already not able to turn on (flashing-standby-light-syndrome)."
2,Stops working after 3 months,"This DVD player does play all types of DVDs no matter how you burn it. But like other reviews, it stopped working after 3-6 months. In my case, it was 3 months. It just doesn't turn on anymore. I unplugged everything and replugged it but it just went dead. I don't watch DVDs much, so it's not like I overused it. Go with another model. This one has problems. I thought mines would be the exception, but I guess not. And now I can't return it because it's been over 30 days."
5,good dvd player,"its probably the best dvd player i have ever had. its awesome, plays just about everything, its slim and easy to use. highly recommend"
4,Can't Complaint,Works Great!! plays my PAL and NTSC DVD's from Region 2 and 4Good region free dvd player.
1,Misleading advertising!,"The details about this product is a bold face lie. It says that this dvd player will play all regions, 1,2,3,4,5, & 6. So, I bought it so I could play a dvd that I purchased from the UK. When I opened the dvd player the manuel says that it in fact does not play all regions. Only dvd's marked region 1 and all region. Bold face liars. I am so upset! Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for allowing misleading advertising on their website."
4,Great player but not perfect,"I don't want to repeat all the good things which have been said about this player. They are all true. I just want to mention 2 things which are probably minor flaws:1. The languages for subtitles on foreign DVD's are limited to English, French and Spanish2. The drive is rather noisy, giving a constant chirping when playing DVD's, and adding a rather annoying 'click' when playing DivX."
4,Excellent Disc Compatibility,"So far, every type of DVD or CD has worked on this unit.It can play most computer video file formats on CD's with no video processing. This saves many hours of work, it would take preparing these files to play on standard DVD Players.Burn downloaded or created mpeg, avi, wmv etc. using standard burner programs, like Nero or Easy CD Creator and then watch them on this DVD player.My biggest complaint, so far, is the very small and cheap remote control. It's one of the worst remotes I have used in many years!The Interface and setup options are also pretty low end.If you need a player that will play almost any type of disc and even computer files (without having to encode them) this unit is great for this. If you want a good remote, controls, and interface, forget about it.I wish Philips would make a unit, with all these disc compatibility features, but with a good remote, better controls and layout and much better user interface."
1,Died after 6 months,"I loved it while it worked... but it only lasted 6 months. If you get it, be sure to get some additional protection as the 90 warranty is insufficient."
4,does more than its worth,"this is a good dvd player but consider the price, you shouldn't be expecting much in terms of support and bugs.good:plays divx files and has some features around it.good dvd playback, has all the requisite s-video, s-component and so forth, I really can't keep up with all the names.about as cheap as it gets.bad:no update forthcoming in terms of firmware, I have a feeling that they won't be updating the firmware anytime soon, that means any new encoding format will likely not be played on this.if you are buying something to keep for more than 2 years and you want to enjoy new formats then you need to buy more expensive models that will have firmware updates. You should expect to run into problems trying to play avi files. In my experiences, my avi files are encoded all over places, some will play, many will frustrate. referred by WhoSave.com a while ago. Good price, but now there may be other models at competitive prices."
2,Not play my DVD-R media,I bought the player with 1109 version firmware from Amazon 2 weeks ago. It just did not load any of my DVD-R media discs. All those DVD-R discs can be played by my old Sanyo DVD player I bought 3 years ago from Walmart. That just did not justify its fame.
2,"You get what you pay for, and it ain't much","Sure, this thing plays everything and anything under the sun. Sure, its loaded with plenty of features for the price. But, it doesn't come close in video quality to my 5-year old Sony unit it replaced. I've tried many various settings combinations, but I can't get rid of the period horizontal color shifts. Another very annoying ""feature"" is that when a movie is stopped mid-stream and you turn off the player, next time you start from the begining. Remote control layout is so weak that it becomes frustrating after awhile, not just a light annoyance. For the money, its great. As a cheapest way into progressive scan DVD, its great. As a great, or even average DVD player - not even close."
3,Have had better non-brandname players,"Plays commercial DVD's fine but doesn't seem to like DVD's burned from a PC. I have converted several home movies from VHS and played them on Symphonic brand DVD players without fail. This player stops playing after a few chapters.I have not tried playing one of the other 10,000 formats it claims it will play since I don't know if it's an issue with the DVD media or just the fact the player is a POS.I may possibly box up the player and send it back to Amazon since it seems to be limited on what it likes to play. Those other formats are worthless if it won't play what I already have made."
2,Good for only 6 months,"Bought this player in Sept. '06 and it died last night mid-way thru a divx movie. I had been very happy with it up to that point. Seemed to play everything. I called the support line and was told that I would have to pay shipping plus labor charges to fix it. They also said it would take approximately 15 days from when they receive it. I decided it wasn't really worth the $ and effort when it only cost me $50.After reading other reviews about Philips products having major problems after only a few months, I think I'll try a different brand."
4,Great player (so far),"I purchased some DVD's from the UK for a Christmas gift for my husband. Turned out none of our other 4 DVD players would play European DVD's. My husband found this player, so we took a chance. After reading some previous reviews, I was skeptical. However, we plugged it in, put in the DVD, and it played beautifully. Also plays our kids' Disney DVD's. Happy so far, and will be even happier if the player lasts a few years!"
3,Alternative source of heat too!,"Works like it should, and you get what you pay for. It is nice and compact, but DO NOT LEAVE ON, unit runs very hot."
2,Avoid This Player for Progressive use.,"I am on my third machine and they all had the same problem. After being turned off for a while, the progressive scan went bad. Going to the menu and turning it off and on again solved the problem but it needs to be reset every time the machine is turned back off.After quite a run around from Philips, they now say this is normal and part of the design. Right, just like a car that only starts every 3rd try.So unless you want to reset this ""feature"" every time you use it, don't bother with this player for HD TV. Sorry Philips, you can't avoid support just because you say a design flaw is ""normal""."
1,"Died after just 6 months, warranty only 3 months!!!!!","I can't believe that Philips wouldn't cover this! The unit won't power up any more (with DVD stuck in the unit), after only 6 months of use. I called Philips to get it repaired / replaced, and they said that the warranty was only good for 3 months, and that I qualified for a ""reduced cost"" excange. Well, reduced cost was about list price + the shipping for the old unit back to Philips. No thanks. So I asked to speak to a supervisor (really didn't seem fair), and was told that all the supervisors we occupied, and I should call back later. I called back 4!! times (and fight their automated operator for about 10 minutes each time), and was never able to get in touch with a supervisor. Their service is terrible, and their warranty is horrible. I will not buy another philips product again. In the end, I tore the unit apart, salvaged my DVD, and bought a Pioneer."
2,Don't expect this to last more than a year of serious usage,"I've bought a total of 4 various Philips DVD players including two of these. Only one still works after a year (not this one). Until they fall apart, they're great. Lots of features. But, DVD players aren't supposed to be disposable are they?By the way, just for more detail as to the specific problem, all 3 that have stopped working had problems with the DVD loading, unloading, and spinning system. Basically, they either would not unload once they were in, or would not spin up."
3,Disney DVD glitch,"This DVD is great especially in its versatility. However, certain DVD's freeze the player, especially Disney DVD's. Also the menus are not as easy to access as other players such as Panasonic."
4,very good purchase,"the dvd works very well. it is very thin, which is great, although i wish it was just slightly less wide."
3,DivX update,"DivX had recommended this one and it was cheap so I got it. Overall it is working out well, but be forewarned Philips has no support yet for these new features either by phone or online so you are on your own. I bought the latest divX converter, which is necessary to convert a lot of stuff that you might download to a format the DVD player can read. Still worth it though for the compression!"
1,"worst dvd player, broke in the first day",Don't buy it. It doesn't play any disc on the first day. I am returning it.
1,NOT HAPPY WIT MY PRODUCT,"the quality of the item was good. however preformance was is a problem. the item freezes movies, skip dem and out right stop playing them. i will return this item. i been tryin to figure out how to exactly do that. but im just going to pack up the damn thing and send it right back to amazon. I need a refund.i dont know why this one does not work. cuz i brought one previously and it works great!!"
1,North Star Electronics Did Me Wrong,"Bad experience with North Star Electronics. I bought a multi-region DVD player for $60. Paid $15 for shipping. It came broken. Paid another $17 to ship it back. And they only wanted to pay me back the $60 the DVD player cost. Whooooppppeeee! I got to pay $32 for a broken DVD player! Needless to say, I got American Express on them, as well as the Illinois Better Business Bureau. I'm not saying North Star is a bad company, but they did me wrong."
1,horrible service on this one,"This unit was playing ok for about a year, and then would not power up, the call to the service department at philips was a nightmare and they would only allow to ""replace"" it at a lower cost,but I would have to ship it there first, without them sending me a box or anything. I put in the trash and will never again buying anything else from phillips."
2,Broke after a year of light use,"I was happy about the DVP642... it played all my movies and MP3/MPEG discs. Unfortunately after a year of light use it decided not to accept discs anymore. I couldn't get it working, and with the warranty gone I had to chuck it in the dumpster. I'm back to my old Panasonic DVD player which is working great still."
2,Except for DVD-R support this player is very versatile,"Amazon.com has a false advertisement about the Philips DVP642, It claims to play DVD+R/RW and DVD-R/RW. However DVD-R support is a myth. I am very well conversant with writing DVDs on my DVD Burner and the Philips Model doesn't support it at all. This is terrible as I have a huge collection my Movies(Back ups) on DVD-Rs and this player renders them useless.Added Later:"" The 642 actually does support some brands of DVD-R, it is extremely picky""Also the DivX support is not anything Great. The videos are not very smooth and there is a lack of QPEL support. I couldn't find any firmware upgrades on the Philips Website.Basically the Avayon DXP1000 and other similar products are much better."
4,Not a substitute for a good CD player.,"I have been very pleased with this player, and agree with the previous reviews regarding its ability to play almost anything that will fit in the tray. Watching avi files on the TV works really well, and it will play burned DVD's that older players choke on.The quality seems better than usual for a mass-market/price point product.One word of warning: Like most consumer audio/video equipment made today, the Phillips' audio DAC is not very good. The high trebles in classical music are horribly thin and tinny. My 15-year old midrange CD player has better sound.If you want a quality CD player a $600 entry-level audiophile unit is really your only option now. Wasn't free trade supposed to INCREASE consumer choice?Don't worry about this griping unless you are a sound nut. I've been very satisfied with the Phillip's sound for movies and pop music. Just don't try to play Wagner on it."
1,Broke on me in 1 months time!!!!!!!!!!,"Man when I first got this DVD player I thought I got a killer deal. It looked nice, played well had great sound etc...Well I got it March 20th and last night (April 27) it BROKE! What a P.O.S!!!!!! I am NEVER buying Philips again.I am going to contact Amazon so see if I have any options on exchanging it.-Not Happy!"
1,"this item blows, really want to give this item negative 5 stars",Bought this item and it worked for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes the dvd player stopped and would not turn on.
4,Great Player,Great player for the price ($66.00). Played everything I threw on it. Has a optical digital output and the resolution is also great.Highly recommended.
1,Buy the Sony DVD player instead,There is a reason this unit has so many one star ratings. My has problems all the time. Good Luck.
1,Junk,"Bought it new, used it maybe five times and it failed. No play, no eject, no nothing. Apparently, this same failure mode happens to a lot of owners. There's nothing you can do unless you solder a new capacitor on the main board -- seems kind of extreme for a cheap DVD player. Don't buy. If you're unlucky enough to already have one, and if it fails with the DVD in it, the manual eject is on the bottom of the unit. Find the odd slot, stick a paperclip in it and slide it to the side to release the tray."
2,Loading then NO DISC,"I've had mine for 6 years then it started saying Loading, then NO DISC around 5 years, it will now only play a DVD every 20-50 attempts!"
2,Phillips DVD Player,"This dvd player was very nice, played dvd, cd, mp3 and avi. Unfortunately it died after just 1 year of service, but for the price of under $50.00 it was worth buying."
2,"Skip this one, it's junk too.","After 8 months of service, this DVD player died. All I get now is a blinking standby/on button. I have decided that brand names are almost meaningless. I replaced this one with a Panasonic. When the Panasonic DVD player dies (I have every confidence that it eventually will), I will be back here reading reviews from Amazon to find the cheapest DVD player that seems the most reliable. Why can't anyone build an inexepensive DVD player that will last? Some of us are not concerned with features, features, features. I guess everything is going the way of the cell phone?What I don't understand, is why my DVD burner in my PC (which cost only $50) has lasted for 4 years and is still running, but I can't by a DVD player that will last more than 18 months... Good luck."
2,"Great Player, died after 6 months","This is a great player, but my died after 6 months of average use. It is a bit sad to me, because the warrenty is only 90 days. Perhaps others will have better luck, but alas, I did not."
4,"A bit loud, but otherwise terrific....","I have yet to explore the multitude of different formats this unit can play, but as essentially every other review has dealt primarily with those issues, I'd say anyone reading is already covered.What I have experienced are a number of DVD's. The picture is crisp and the progressive scan seems to be solid, but there is a bit of a drawback. On discs that are in mint condition, the set plays nice and quietly. However, any DVD with even minor scrathes will have an obscenely loud chirping eminating throughout the entire film. It's quite amazing how violently different two DVD's of only marginal different in condition can play on it.PAL conversion appears to be solid. A few jaggies at the edges of objects occasionally, but nothing to fret about. My main problem is with the set's inability to play DVD's that may not be mint without that incessant shill/chirping, as it renders any rentals nearly unwatchable for me."
1,Broke after 1 year,This DVD player was a marvel--for one year. Yesterday I was faced with a blinking red light and a dead machine. Apparently it is some type of capacitor problem. I called Philips but they couldn't do anything for me. No more Philips products for me. I want something that will last more than a year.
3,Simple DVD player with DivX support,"Probably the best DVD/DivX player for the money. Definetely not the best DVD player over all. It looks a little bit cheap, lacks buttons on front panel, remote is awkward, system menus lack functionality and glamour of other makes. Sound on all DivX's I played on out-of-the-box player was out of sync. Problem was solved by installing new firmware from Philips. Be prepared to have fun after you installed new firmware. Player switches to PAL and it takes some time to switch it back to NTSC.This player is not the best choice for non-tech-savvy people."
2,Has trouble reading disks.,"I don't know if we got a lemon or what, but our player doesn't live up to other reviews. While most features work as advertised, we have problems just getting a DVD to play correctly.Just recently, we missed over ten minutes of a movie just trying to fast forward through spots where the DVD player freezes up. When it can't read a disk, it often becomes unresponsive to all commands and we physically have to walk up to the player and yank the power cord in order to restart it. This skipping problem happens with at least half of all DVDs making movie watching a chore rather than a hobby. All in all, the particular unit we have is a piece of crap and we will be replacing it before watching any more DVDs.We did buy it at Fred Meyer and not Amazon so maybe that's why we're having trouble."
5,Great deal for the money,"I bought this after waiting for a year since I'm not much of a gadget hound, should have done it when I first saw it on Amazon! (I've had it for a week now.)Pros:It has played most of what I've thrown at it with no problem. (yes nothing to add to it).Like the slim look.near-Cons:Remote not as slick looking as the player, seems flimsy.Slow to read the cds but I guess I should have expected that too aye.~"
2,Expected something better,"I bought this player because of the generally favorable online reviews. It was also cheap and easy to unlock (make into a region-free player). After 3 months with this player, I have given up on it and will be returning it for something different. It continually freezes up, usually during the FBI warning. Other than this glitch, I have to say that the remote control unit is one of the worst pieces of plastic I have ever used. The control buttons do not have a positive feel to them and anyone with medium to larger fingers will have endless fun trying to find/press the right button! I have rated this unit 2 stars because when it did work, the picture/sound quality were both very good."
1,Phillips breaks immediately,"I bought a Phillips DVD player and it broke immediately (the small disc that holds the DVD fell off). When I returned it, at my own cost for postage for the entire unit--speakers included, this was their condition--they sent me another one that was broken with a bogus serial number. Then they told me the second one was out of warranty when I asked for a replacement. Their products break easily and their customer service isn't helpful."
1,BUYER BEWARE - This dvd player is a piece of junk,I've had this dvd player for less than a year and it quit working. The on/off button no longer works (I tried trouble shooting this and finally had to take the player apart myself to get the dvd out). Don't waste your money on this player...it'll just end up in a landfill.The dvd player I had before this lasted over 5 years and cost less!
2,Died after 6 months; beware Philips product warranty,"Nothing spectacular, but it did the job, ie, play Region 1 & 2 DVDs. Picture OK, about what you'd expect at this price. But picture started to flicker after 6 months, then player died completely. Called Philips, they told me warranty on 642/37 expires after 3 months, after that the only option you have is get a new unit at a 20% discount, and minus the region-free capability, which is dealer-installed. My advice: Skip this player, go for a brand with better product quality & customer service in the same price range, eg, Panasonic DVD-S47 or Panasonic DVD-S27."
4,***Good choice for Region Free***,"Purchased this DVD to be able to play DVD's from the UK. ""Little Britain"", ""Only Fools and Horses"", and ""Gimme, Gimme, Gimme"" all coded for Region 2 play as they should. The reverse button does not seem to work, but I have not really taken a lot of time to learn all the functions of the remote.Only just used it, so I will report back with any problems found.**Update 5/31/05--Still no problems to report! Working out well**Update 2/10/06--Still no problems and music CD's play quite nicely with this product as well."
2,broke in 3 mos under warranty,mine broke after 3 mos. Philips has it now and will replace it (taking 4 weeks). I had to pay shipping. I say spend $100 and forget about these cheap'o models.
1,Warranty,I was happy with this player until it stopped working 8 months after I bought it. Philips will not help as the warranty only lasts 6 months if you have purchased it online. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.
2,"Noisy, poor remote, picture only average","I bought the DVP642 because I wanted to be able to play Divx movies as well as having good progressive output. While the system works as advertised with Divx files, other flaws hurt this device. There is a noticable clicking noise whenever a disc is playing. This comes from the drive tray itself, not the audio output. The remote lacks discrete on/off buttons which makes it harder to integrate into a home theatre environment. To switch from progressive mode to regular output, you have to go through a series of menus. Finally, the picture from the system is not very good, comparable to $30-40 units. In all, unless you MUST have Divx, give the Philips DVP642 a pass."
3,A best divx player. A worst dvd player.,"This is a wonderful Divx player for sure. But its DVD play is terrible. Seriously, it is terrible. The resolution (the sharpness of images) is lower than others. Color is all blur. and it makes chunky pixellation sometimes. I have had 4 DVD players so far (1 non-progressive, 3 progressive). But this is the worst one(even worse than non-progressive one). Don't get me wrong. I love its divx play. it's as good as dvd movies. If you have lots divx movies, this is for you. But if you are serious dvd movie lovers but don't even know what divx format is, please look for other dvd player."
5,Plays anything I have tried so far :),"Like the title says it has played anyhting I have tried so far. It plays dvds exalent and plays divx pretty good (pixilated). For the price you cant beat it, looks good too."
3,A Normal one,"This woulbe be a suitable DVD player, if you do not mind the memory function. But I do. I once had a pioneer DVD player which can store 5 positions on the DVDs. So I can easily resume from where I stopped. The philips one does a very bad job on that! I have to start from the beginning every time.The picture is just so so ( I have not tried the Progressive display since my TV has no that funtion). The color is not so good as it is said.The pro is the compatibility. It plays all kinds of discs!"
3,"Very Nice, but lacking a couple things","Looks very nice on the outside. Picture is really clear. Size is compact, vertically. Doesn't have a memory or bookmarker option when I'm powering off. Doesn't work with my universal remote."
3,Great concept poor execution,"I bought this for a family friend visiting from Europe and as he had several DVD-R he had made on his Sony unit in Europe, therefore, I was hoping that this would play them.A no go. Ughhh!A bit disappointing."
1,It broke almost immediately,The player broke before playing through its first DVD. Now the door won't open and I can't get the DVD out. Try a different brand if you're looking for a DVD player that'll work for more than 10 minutes.
1,this is garbage and i should have took the advice of those who already knew,I read the reviews on this dvd but went completely against what many had said about dvd's not being read and all that could possibly go wrong. i haven't used this dvd player more than one hundred times and it's mostly on the blink. wasted money.
3,All Region DVD Player,"The DVD player, which was advertised on an all-region page, was not all-region when it arrived. However, it plainly stated on the box that it was for region 2, and there was no problem whatsoever when I returned it, having only paid postage."
1,This thing sucks!,My husband and I just brought this DVD player home this evening. It played one movie just fine. I even thought...how great for so cheap. I put in the next movie and after I finished watching the previews and started the movie it started making this awful noise. The thing can't be turned off. I had to unplug it to get it to power off. I even re-started it and it did the very same thing. It goes back tomorrow! Don't waste your money!
1,One Year? You guys were lucky!,"My roommate bought this DVD player in September and now, in November, its breaking!It will play the first half of a DVD but then it will pause, skip ahead a few seconds and then return to the menu. Most of the time it won't even READ the DVD.Terrible product."
4,Zone Free? Easy as 7-8-9 OK,"Just arrived, Amazon Ships (most) things quick and for free! Set up was easy, now it's not a top of the line unit but it is more than adequate. This unit is set up for both PALS to NTSC play but it is NOT multi regional. For most people that is not a big deal. However,after vacationing in Europe and getting some vacation (Tourist) DVD I got a crash course in ""Regional"" DVD players. I did a quick google search and got this code;after setting up unit with your TV turn unit on and open the door with the remote input 7-8-9--OK--0 Next turn unit off and turn it back on, it should now be Region Free. I do not know if this could do any damage (I don't see how) and I've read that sometimes it needs to be repeated but I input the information one time put in my Ally McBeal (from the UK a Region 2 DVD) and it works fine. I then put in a standard USA DVD and it works too. NO GUARANTEE just my experience"
2,"Product failed within a year, ""warranty"" useless","I purchased this DVD player in December 2004, and in November 2005 it failed; it no longer turns on at all, just stays in standby mode all the time. The warranty card said that from 91 days through 1 year after purchase, I had a limited warranty, where I could have the product replaced for a fee. Well, I called Philips today and they informed me that the replacement fee was $40, and I had to pay to send the original unit back to Philips!The DVD player was fine until then, so it wasn't a total loss, but know that if you buy this item and it fails after 90 days, you might as well buy a new one."
1,Lacking in quality and service,"Bought this in Dec 2004. It broke in May 2005. Philips is supposed to do a reduced cost exchange and I'm still waiting in July 2005.Apparently, the quality of this player leaves a lot to be desired. And to top it off, try dealing with the customer service personnel in Manila who just don't seem to get anything done."
5,BEST REGION FREE DVD PLAYER,BEST region Free Code Free DVD Player sold any where. This DVD Plays any dvd i throw at it.
1,Multi Region?,"I bought this DVD Player under the assumption that it played any region and also PAL. I opened the manual and it said that it only plays dvds that say region 1 or ALL. Can someone please tell me if it actually plays region 2 - 6, or if I just wasted my money."
2,Decent while it lasts...,"This Philips DVP642 is a decent DVD player for the money, while it lasts.I bought my first one in late 2004 and it died on me by mid 2005, and paid for a replacement from Philips then. My second one just died a few days ago.Same problem with each of them, all of the sudden it will just stop reading any DVD you put in there saying ""No Disc"" and the same response from Philips ""It's out of warranty you'll have to pay another 50 dollars for us to send you a replacement.""There's a reason that this one is so cheap to pick up, you get what you pay for.While it worked it was a fine DVD player, but breaking after less than a year just seems unacceptable. If I knew then what I know now I'd have kept on shopping and shelled out an extra few bucks for something that wouldn't fall apart."
1,Lousy customer service and bad product,"The DVD player was defective. Called their customer service and they offered to replace it. After shipping the item to them it was impossible to get in contact with them. I emailed them (at all their listed email addresses) multiple times. I also tried calling them at their listed number. No one ever picked up their phone and the voicemail I got routed to was always full and would not let me leave a message.After three weeks of trying to contact them, I used the A-Z gaurantee from Amazon to get a refund."
4,Great Dvd Player if you want to watch Downloaded Videos,"If you're into downloading videos off the internet and wanna watch them on your tv, this dvd player is for you. Unfortunately, this player does have its problems as a stand alone dvd player. First of all, while playing any disc it makes a ticking noise, but if you like volume kinda high its barely noticeable. The ticking can get really annoying during quiet moments during films, though. Second, the stand by red light can be annoying. Overall, it plays ""ALMOST"" every kind of video and disc format there is, doesn't skip, has lasted 2 years for me. So, in my opinion it was a good purchase."
3,Standby light blinking,I received this as a gift last Christmas. It quit after about 6 months. I finally dusted it off today and Googled for a fix. I found a fix on an Amazon forum. It cost me about $10 to repair it and 20 minutes of my time. Mine is an older unit so maybe Phillips has fixed the power supply capacitor problem by now.It is a good unit otherwise.
4,Great DVD player,"I bought this in 2005, and it is still one of the most feature rich player today - a good buy even at the originaly price!I just wish this had H.264 support and better anamorphic conversion, if you try to play anamorphic AVIs, you will get it letterboxed - still not a big show stopper."
2,this dvd player sucks!,I tried watching a brand new tv show boxset on this dvd player and it kept pausing. So I used my other dvd player from Panasonic and it worked! This dvd player was the worst buy ever!
1,Dies after a short Time.,We have had two of these now the first one died after a year and a half. The second died after 5 months. The warrenty is only 3 months. I believe they are designed to fail after so many uses. This is not a good DVD player.
3,Remote control does not have dish tray open/close button.,Can not open/close the dish tray from the remote control.
2,Not a very good product,"After replacing the unti several times and going through firmware updates the Philips DVP642 never really performed as advertized. DivX worked poorly, if at all, and MPEG4 did not work at all. At best it is a ""tolerable"" DVD player offering nothing at all to distinguish itself other than its price.I would not recommend this product to others.I checked with the DivX organization and was not at all impressed with their certification program because of the very poor performance of this player."
3,Features are propotional to the price,"Philips DVP642 DivX-Certified Progressive-Scan DVD PlayerThis is a nice entry level DVD player that permits DVD/ MP3/ DIVX readouts. The designs nice and the player yields good quality images. However it would have been very convinient to have a eject button on the remote control. Everytime you want to change or remove the disc, you have to try and locate the eject button on the face of the dvd player.Its a nice gadget for the money spent."
4,Why it is $189?,"I bought this player in Target for $60 3 years ago. Works good especially after software upgrades. I could not understand what is sold for $189?Now a few new, march better, Philips players available, all DivX certified, progressive scan and so on... All in range of $50-$70.May be I did not understand something??????????????"
1,dissapointed one,Did not not like the units operating system. Did not like red light always on..Returned for creditSeller was very cooperative and refund was immediate.
3,You Get What You Pay For!,"This DVD player is fine, nothing fancy. For under 50 dollars, one shouldn't expect anything great in a DVD player. I like this machine because I can easily switch to any region and it will therefore play any DVD. I just googled the DVD player's name against ""region code"" and found out how to do this with ease. So in summary, this DVD player is OK. You get a nice picture and can play any DVD. That would be the reason to buy it."
5,AWESOME!,"This is absolutely awesome! I've had the non region free model for almost 2 years now and this one for almost a year, they are both still working fine. Divx formats that wont even play on my computer will play on this just fine. It's awesome for slideshows, mpg's whatever. This unit ROCKS! Especially for the price!"
1,Don't buy Phillips,"This unit worked fine for 8 months of little use and then simply stopped working - all buttons & remote inactive, with no way of getting at the imprisoned DVD in the player.Phillips service was basically useless - the ""equivalent replacement"" policy for the 91 days - 1 year limited warranty would have cost $42.00 plus shipping - a pointless endeavor on a $65 player."
3,"Over hyped , multi format over rated",I recall buying this one for the fact it supported just about every coded and was firmware upgradable...Big deal never ended up sticking anything but a DVD and VCD in the thing...Decently priced at the time though
5,Research garauntees results,There is a hidden art to learning and research. I have a region 2 DVD and this player was supposed to play only region 1. When I received it I noticed that right off it did not play any other region as it is so plainly advertised to. I called and stayed ont he phone with customer service for almost an hour and got nothing but aplologies and excuses. they are not even aware that they are falsely advertising this. There are no codes or anything. i decided that the information superhighway had to have some knowledge on it about this product and i found the applicable codes. So log on and find your codes if you want to use this product.
5,dvd player,this player is a real deal for the price. It will play virtually any format which was what I needed. I haven't had any problem with it and recommend it highly.
4,"decent dvd player, plays xvid/divx mostly","As a dvd player, this is a distinctly middle-of-the-road player. It's not terribly expensive, but it's not terribly well put together, either.The killer feature for me is the DivX (and Xvid, though they don't advertise that) capability, which works. Mostly. Sometimes there are files that it simply won't play. It doesn't deal at all with WMV files (nor does it claim to, but it's still frustrating), and it doesn't decode as well as the best computer-based codecs. But it does play them, unlike any other dvd player I could find."
5,excellent value and functionality,"This is a very sleek, good-looking multi-zone dvd player that works very well. It is very low-profile making it extrememly unobtrusive so looks good in any setting. And for the price it is extremely good value. Recommended."
1,DivX audio is off synch with this DVD player,This dvd player did not play any of my DivX cds. The sound was off synch whenever I played any of them. I bought this mainly for that function. I took it back and bought an even cheaper Toshiba model which works great after I changed the audio setting. I would go with the Toshiba model in this price range. If you don't care about the DivX feature than this model would be a good purchase since it's relatively cheap.
5,It does everything advertised,"No question, this is the best dvd player for the money. It plays everything I have DVDs (Region 1 and 4), DivX movies and TV programs, pictures cds, you name it. Highly recommended."
1,Lasted 1.5 years,This producted worked great for 1.5 years and suddenly died. Philips representatives would not help me with trouble shooting since my warranty was expired. Unplugging the product for 10-15 seconds (the manuals recommendation did not work). Save your money and buy something that will last.
1,Died in 6 months! Philips customer service is worthless.,"This DVD player is not worth one red cent! I bought the Philips DVP 642 in February 2006 because of its ability to read DivX format. It stopped functioning properly by August 2006!!! Problem was consistent regardless of which DVD was played (screen would randomly scramble, turn green, freeze, then player would turn off). No improvement with either cleaning or unplugging the player for 10min as the Philips support center suggested. THEN Philips wanted us to pay $40 for a replacement with an additional $10 shipping charge- for a DVD player we paid $70 for 6 months ago! Philips refused to budge on their policy so we gave up. Just got back from Best Buy with a new Toshiba DVD player.p.s. our 2y.o. Philips TV also just died on us and we paid $150 to get that one fixed (only 2 weeks before the DVD player went!) I sure won't buy anything made by Philips again!"
2,Everything went into Divx,"I bought a couple of these. I backed-up videos to CD after re-encoding them to Xvid format with ESS Standalone Support using AutoGK (Gordon Knot). The movies turned out fantastic.After that, this DVD player has much to be desired. The software is aweful and there's no support from Phillips. Controls are non-standard, so your learning a new system. I went from a 5 year old Panasonic to a new $40 Toshiba player and the controls were the same. Not this puppy. Also, the unit is cheaply made and prone to break quickly. One of the two I bought started making clicking sounds as it read disks. I took both of them back and went with the $40 Toshiba from Costco/BJs (got one at each for the same price). Although the Toshiba won't play Divx, I'm fine burning mpeg-2 DVDs for having a good, standard, reliable DVD player."
1,DVD Failure after 1 year,"This is the fourth DVD player (second Philips brand) to fail after one year of use. It always happens within a month or two of the warranty expiration. This time, the unit just won't turn on. Other times, the players began to fail at reading discs, occasionally at first, then for most discs. I am really frustrated with buying a new unit every year. I tried to get Philips to honor the warranty since the player failed just one month out of warranty, but they wouldn't do it. They offered a refurbished replacement for $30 - with only a 90 day warranty - definiely not a good deal. I will boycott Philips products from now on, and I hope you do so, too."
1,Handle DVD-R poorly,"After read some good review, I decided to buy this dvd player. It is realy a nice looking player, it has all the feature I was looking for, component, digital audio. However, the good feeling ended as soon as I put in DVD I made of my kids. It paused frequently, displayed mosaic squares on screen. It became useless to me after 1 minute test, I have to send it back to Amazon.com. If you plan to used it home made DVDs, reconsider."
4,Satisfied,This product produces quality pictures for its price. Its sleek slim design compliments the decor of the living room . I think the price is reasonable and the quality is GREAT
2,Terrible remote,"Remote works only occasionally for me, and at random times it prompts me for the parental level password, when Parental controls are disabled.. very poor controls.. I will spend a little more and get a real DVD player."
1,Piece of JUNK,"I bought this DVD player last month and I had to return it because it wouldn't keep the right time while watching a DVD, Amazon sent a replacment for it today and it does the same crap PLUS it won't open and now my disc is stuck in there. I'm done with Philips. Save your money and buy a Panasonic"
1,Piece of junk,"Stupid product. Played nicely for some time, then stopped recognizing DVDs and CD-RWs altogether (No Disc message). Now only plays CD-Rs. Turns out to be a common problem with units sold before Jan 2006. Don't buy this poor quality product"
1,Doesn't play region 3!!!,"This is not a code free multi region player, on page 19 of the manual it reads ""plays only DVDs marked region 1 or all regions"" I poped in a Region 3 disk, (Korean) and it comes up ""wrong region"". I was shocked and ticked off. I'm returning it!"
3,Clean slim design but flawed,"I bought one when it first came out. I was hoping to enjoy Divx anime on it. It was nicer on the computer monitor. It doesn't give the divx movie the same widescreen ability as the computer does. It was hard reading some of the subtitles. This system is especially noisey when reading the disc. The tray for the disc is very shallow as well, you sometimes have to look twice to make sure its seated before closing the disc tray. Its not worth $70 but reasonable at $40-$45."
5,Good player for DivX format movie.,"I bought this two years before for playing .avi and mp4 movie downloaded from internet. It can play about 80% of the movies with updated firmware. It looks like the manufacture stopped update the firmware for it anymore. There is another kind Philips DVD player with HDMI output now with similar price. Now I only use this to play regular DVD because I hook up a computer with HDTV video card to my HDTV, with the computer and the codec, I can play any format including rmvb movies in my big screen TV now."
4,This player delivers.,"Based on some of the reviews I've read, this player might give me problems down the line, but right now, I'm thrilled. I purchased a DVP642/37 and it played my PAL dvd's right out of the box. No need to hack or anything. Easy set-up, nice picture and I'm watching region 2 stuff with no problem."
3,"poor user interface, picture quality not so great","This player works as advertised - I was able to play DIVX and PAL movies without a problem, but...When playing regular DVDs, I noticed that the picture quality was not very good compared to my old DVD player which is also very basic. I tried adjusting the picture but it didn't help. The remote control is awkward to use and so is the user interface of the system menu. For some reason the 'preferences' option is completely disabled.I could not find a way to display the elapsed/remaining time on the screen even after looking at the manual.If you just need an inexpensive region-free player - buy it. But beware - this unit is far from being a good quality DVD player."
5,plays almost everything,"it's cheap and goodit plays almost everything I have ... specially the dvd's containing 6-7 movies as avi format files.it plays also audio CD's, not only the mp3 ones.it plays and rotate pictures Jpeg format on music ... so it's like a slideshowone word: GREAT !!! specially when you pay only $33 for it because you get a $30 discount for the first purchase made with Amazon.com credit card if you buy it from an Amazon.com store (not an affiliated one)"
4,Great DVD Player,"Had very little trouble. It screwed up playing some homemade Divx dvd's a few times, but playing the menu buton fixed it. Other then that a great all format dvd player."
1,"You get what you pay for, which isn't very much","It's a basic player, and it claims ""you have it, we play it."" That much is true. BUT1) Remote is confusing to figure out - e.g. scan controls are traditionally near the play button, but in this case aren't. Took me 1/2 hr to figure that out.2) Resume play feature doesn't exist. They claim it is only on ""compatible discs"" - which means none at all.3) Runs hotI returned this player - still looking for a good one to replace my old Sony that is slowly breaking down, but still preferable to this."
1,dvp542 has vertical roll when first turned on,"Need help, I can not stop the dvd from a vertical roll when first turned on. This is without inserting a DVD. The systems just remains in this vertical roll.Anyone with a similar problem?Please help!!!!"
2,buyer beware!!!,i bought this after not looking at some of the reviews on it. i really messed up doing that !! the player plays ok but i can't get it to turn off !! the only way is to unplug it !! the other thing is you have to use the remote to open the disc tray!! i hate to have to pack it up and send it back but i may have to !! i would say what happened was i recieved one that J & R had sent back to them and was never fixed and i got it instead !! these are the only 2 problems i have so far but it's only been mine a couple of days.
4,"Excellent DVD Player, so so Remote Control","Bought two for my house, dump the others I had !! Only problem is the very BASIC control, I had to buy universal ones to control the units."
2,Disappointed by Poor Quality,"I did my research before buying this DVD player by reading reviews. I liked the relatively high ratings and Amazon.com description that promised it played NTSC, PAL and all different region's DVDs. However, I was very disappointed with it once I started using it and ended up giving it away to someone else. (In fairness, my player did not break or malfunction, which seemed to have happened to some users.)Remote: very flimsy, buttons non-intuitive and very close together; because the remote's unlit, hard to use in a dark roomPlayback: problems playing disks from other countries (my DVDs were not boot-legs); can only fast forward up to 8x speed, which is very irritating when you are watching a DVD without lots of chapters and want to go straight to a certain part"
1,Was fine until it DIED within a year!,"It as a perfectly fine DVD player until it wouldn't load discs any longer. We tried and tried, and bought DVD head cleaner, and went to the Philips site and consulted our manual.Buy a Sony."
4,Really Region - Free!,"This DVD player is really easy to become region-free! I received the player today and pressed 7,8,""ok"", 0 on the remote. Then this guy played DVDs from Asia without any problems! The reason I gave this model only 4 stars is that the image and audio quality is not as good as Malata 806 (Malata is a leading Chinese DVD player brand name sold by Amazon before). But my Malata 806 broke after 1 year usage.No need to buy the more expensive DVP642/37 region-free model as you can make this cheaper model region-free in 5 seconds!"
1,Will break with minimal use,"So I'm at least the third reviewer of this DVD player and mine also broke in one year's time. Now past warranty, the unit doesn't power up and the customer service people (my god, they are just as bad as the product) said that I had to pay to ship it back and pay $40 for another, likely refurbished one. I know it only costs $65, but I barely used the thing and it breaks.. I'd expect that from something branded ""Goldstar"" but I had always thought Philips was, I don't know, decent quality. So much for that. This one's a stinker."
1,Great DVD Player...very bad reliability,This DVD player will play just about anything...that's the good news...the bad news is the reliability is bad.This unit has only lasted 6 months and now the DVP642 component video outputs all my DVD movies in a deep blue tint! Unwatchable.I called Philips service department...this unit only has a 3 month warranty! I can choose to pay $47+shipping and they will swap my unit...the original price is only $53 at the store...I guess Philips business model is to make cheap garbage and not support their products...what a shame.
1,DEAD after 8 months..!,Avoid this unit at all cost. it simply died after 8 months of normal use. The standy button started blinking and the tray would not open. This DVD player unit has become useless. Disconnecting the unit from the power supply for a couple of hours does not solve the problem. The unit simply would not respond to the remote or the buttons on the unit.It's DEAD!
1,Caveat emptor,"After five months, my DVD player succumbed to the dreaded blinking red power light. I just got off the phone with Philips customer service. The woman was very nice, but that doesn't make up for the fact that to get a replacement unit I have to pay $40 plus shipping. Not much less than I paid for it initially.This product seemed like a great deal... and if you end up with one of the units that isn't defective, it *is* a great deal. But I've read too many reviews citing a product life of 6 months or less. Not worth the risk, if you ask me. Any price advantage evaporates very rapidly if you are buying a new unit several times a year. I'm going to pony up more cash for my next unit and read the Amazon reviews VERY carefully."
1,Not the only one with problems,"Looked like a good, inexpensive player, but in less than a year it died. It performed well until 9 months later it one day it refused to open the tray. Phillips said i could send it in and get it fixed for $40, but a brand new one only costs a few dollars more. Not worth it, don't buy it, others have had a similar problem."
1,Double Disappointment,"I bought 2 from Amazon in 2004 at $65 each. One died just before the 1-year warranty expired. Philips sent another free of charge and I didn't even have to send them the old one. When I got the replacement, I put it in storage.Shortly after the 1-year warranty on the second unit expired, it went dead as well.I pulled the replacement out of storage and put it into service only to have it quit after a couple of months.Bought 2 in 2004 and by December 2005 I had no working 642s.Brings shame to the Philips name brand."
1,"DVP642 ""NO DISK"" fix","I owned DVP642 for less than a year and suddenly it stopped reading disks (""NO CD"" message). That happened after the player presumably overheated when operating under the hot sat receiver. I opened its case, spread some flux over all chips I could find on the decoder board (it's placed between CD reader and power supply board) and used a butane soldering iron till the solder melted. Now the unit works flawlessly. I guess many problems other than ""no disk"" could be cured with this method. Otherwise, I'm very satisfied with Philips DVP642."
2,Has a short life!,"I, like Mr. Perry Cook from Denver, had the same luck as far as the power light blinking = death.Except I have had this happen to 3 of the 4 DVP642's I have bought.The people at Philips only wanted to sell you another one for a reduced price.You get what you pay for!"
5,Outstanding region free player,"Bought this months ago and have enjoyed watching European DVDs without a hitch. Like other reviewer, Amazon.co.uk provides many DVDs otherwise unavailable in USA. Can see movies, BBC and other TV programs either not aired here, not released on DVD in USA, etc. A great value."
1,Dead (blinking red power light) after year in service,"This player worked o.k. for a year. It played most (but not all) DivX files I fed it -- say, about 90% of them. Occasionally audio would unsynchronize from video; or video would freeze; some files wouldn't play at all. I think the player's codek / firmware is pretty old; and/or the chip is too slow to decode fast video stream.After a year of this o.k. service the player suddenly decides to stop working. I, like many others, am left staring at a blinking red power light that doesn't go away unless you unplug it. The machine is dead. I searched the Internet for the string ""philips dvp642 blinking"" and found way too many hits. Sorry, Philips, I will shop for a different brand for the replacement."
4,"A very elegant, versatile and powerful player at a very attractive price.","I design microchips for a living and I am extremely fussy about my electronics. This player is very slim, and can literally play anything I throw at it, including PAL DVDs, and MPEG4 audio. It has TOSLink and coaxial digital outputs, as well as Y, Cr, Cb video outs, in addition to the standard output set. It lacks an RF modulator, so it does not output to channel 2 or 3. Your TV would have to be pretty old for this to be a problem.Given the current industry confusion over Blu-Ray or HD DVD as the standard for Hi-Def, this is a great intermediate player. One thing important to note. This player takes several seconds to load a DVD. I believe this is because it is scanning the disk surface for multiple formats. Its not really an annoyance, but did scare me a little at first."
2,DVD was great for 2 years,"I bought this DVD about 2 years ago. It was really easy to hook it up. I was watching movies from different regions - no problem. DVD was working perfectly until yesterday when it suddenly died. Sound was coming out, but no picture. I was disappointed. Tried to call support - and of couse because I was using it for more than year, my warranty expired and they wanted to charge me $15 just to talk to me. This time I'll try something different."
3,What a disappointment,"I bought this item for the multi-regional/format function. That works okay. However, all my DVD+R/RW freeze after 45 minutes. My long MP3's begin to skip and garble after 1 1/2-2 hours of playing.I spent literally hours on the line with Philips tech support, who were polite, but not very helpful. Finally they suggested I exchange the item for a new one. I did, but the new one did exactly the same thing. I tested my DVD-R's on an old Panasonic that I have and on a Pioneer from a neighbor and they worked perfectly. Needless to say this second one is going back as well. Shame on Philips!"
1,Progressive scan on this one not good enough for projectors,"The progressive scanning solution employed by this player is truly subpar. This DVD player is simply not suited for projectors or other large screen situations. In the past couple years I've used three different DVD players in progressive mode, projected on a large screen, and this was the first time I ever was stunned by the massive DROP in quality. I'd assumed that all DVD pictures looked about the same, but this player sadly proves that isn't true."
3,"it is decent, but not great","if you are music lover and care about sound quality more than video, then this one is not that good, the sound is sharp but not natural compared to Panasonic. the picture is extra sharp too. if you like this kind of sharpness, then it is ok, but I dont like.the machine is noisy too, the sound of operation is loud enough to distract your attention to music.other than these two concerns, the machine is acceptable regarding the low price, but I personally disagree Philips low end stratege, they are famous for there hi-quality products in CD era, and they can keep doing so, instead they sell this for only $40 during this holiday season, I really dont understand."
1,Dead after 9 months Dont Buy,This player was great until the dreaded flashing red power light appeared. Now its dead.
1,Very poor durability.,"Bought mine on November 14th, 2004. Watched about three DVDs a week until last night (September 14th, 2005), when the player died mid-movie. And I mean ""died"" as in ""dead.""The Philips web troubleshooting site is useless, so we called customer service. The item is still covered by a product warranty, but Philips charges a $46 (USD) replacement fee for warranty returns, plus you have to pay to ship the item back. You do the math. To top things off, it took me twenty minutes to disassemble the unit and recover my DVD.Go click somewhere else -- this one's garbage."
5,SOLID DVD WORKHORSE PLAYER,"With its ability to DVD-Video, video CD, audio CD, JPEG image CD, and CDs loaded with MP3, MPEG-4, or DivX 3.11/4.x/5.x files, the Philips 642 is at that top of the class in terms of lower to mid-range priced DVD players.I have played a number of different formats on this player and had great success with all of them. I've found the interface and features all very easy to use.Bottom line is that this one does as good if not better than many higher end units. A true value."
2,I returned it,It didn't do what I wanted it to do so I sent it back and got a different one. For general use it would be fine though.
4,Philips DVP642,"I'll keep it short; purchased 2 in 2004, one for me and one for my sister. I've used mine since and no real problems, sis just plugged hers in. Has some difficulties with mpeg/vob files but most divx/xvid will play, at worst download divx create or dr. divx and run your video through it, they'll play great then. the stop button = eject if you hold it down long enough, small design flaw."
1,Philips just might be a dirty word!,"Our Philips 642/37 Region Free stopped working, BAM, right in the middle of a taut mystery! With a multitude of suspects, several intriguing story arcs, and us on the edge of our seats. Without warning,the DVD player stops working. We franticallly tried to revive it, pressed all buttons. But it was dead. (Prime suspect: Philips!) The DVD was stuck in the player, no way out. Thanks to someone else's review, the next morning we got out a screw driver, removed the entire top of the player. At least that was easy. But now we have to look for another DVD player, and we considered this Philips 642/37 as our ""new"" one."
1,Didn't even last 8 months!!,"While I used this item it was fine and I only used regular DVDs in this DVD player. I did not use it frequently but regardless, after 5 months and 25 days this player just stopped working. No lights, no power, I can't even get my DVD out of the player! I called Phillips and their troubleshooting advice was to unplug it and then push the start button... ARE YOU KIDDING ME!! And since the warranty is only 90 days they could not replace the unit. They could exchange the unit for $40 + tax. Plus I have to pay for the shipping to ship the original unit back. I paid $60 for this product originally, why should I pay another $60 for another crappy player!?Save yourself the trouble and spend more money on a better unit/brand. I bought my father a Sony DVD player YEARS ago and not a single problem."
5,Excelente DVD dixv y Xvid player,"lo compre y me lo hice mandar hasta argentina, este dvd me ha leido las mas de 30 peliculas en divx que tenia, solo una no logro decodificar el sonido. La calidad de imagen es excelente, se lo puede hacer multizona y macro off, ademas se lo puede actualizar segun salgan codecs nuevos, en resumen lee de todo. Por ahi tiene pequeños problemas para leer discos pero nada que no se solucione con un Stop y play de nuevo, saludos desde cordoba.- Mario"
1,has difficulty with dirt and layer changes,"you have to be willing to live with skipping video and sound whenever it runs into a layer change or dirt--when it plays well, and it can on about 1/4 of my dvds, it is great but I don't like the poor performance on most dvds--I bought another player and have had no troubles since (using the same dvds that were unplayable on this player)"
1,Disappointed,"Product didn't last 3 months,first DVD player went out,now VHS part doesn't show apicture !!Wasted my money !!"
1,Piece of Junk,"The unit quit working after only one year. It's had a good life & good location and there is no good reason for it to break. Consider another brand so this does not happen to you.A 2nd issue, if you're still considering purchasing this product is the poor ergonomics on the remote control. It's too easy to press the ""next scene"" button when you're trying to fast forward. Not a great design."
1,Broken product,I bought this DVD player and it didn't work. I tried to contact the seller but they couldn't replace or refund money. I was very disapointed.
1,Poor Product,I just purchased this in order to work with PAL region dvds.It is less than 2 weeks old and has been used maybe 6 times and has stopped working. Every time I put in a dvd it sends back the message 'no disc'.I see from the reviews I am not the only person this has happened to.I feel like I just threw away $60.00.I strongly recommend spending a little extra money for better quality.
1,Quite disappointed!!!,I bought this DVD player for 10 months and now it's dead!!! The warranty cover labor and CRT for only 6 months and the parts for 12 months. I didn't play it a lot for sure. Is the product life too short?
1,horrible purchase,"this is the second region free dvd player i purchased and as the first one, it stopped working after ALMOST 2 MONTHS OF USE!!!! please do not buy this item!!!!"
1,Didn't last for a month,This machine made clicking sounds from the beginning. The lights would dim and flash. Then the movies wouldn't play and I had the machine less than a month. My 10 year old Sony DVD player still works great. I thought Philips was supposed to be a decent player. I'm very disappointed.
3,Philips DVP642 DVD Player,"I purchased this DVD player because it stated it would play all regions. I needed a DVD player to play Region 2, not realizing the DVD needed to have the symbol for All Regions. It would not work for my DVD. I returned the product to Amazon where they gave me a full refund including shipping, no questions asked. I am not sure how well the DVD player works, but I was happy that Amazon gave me a refund."
1,This DVD player has some serious problem,"I bought this DVD player about an year ago. Suddenly it stopped reading CDs with avi / mpeg files. Though the description boasts that it can read DIVX files etc., eventually it does not. My DVD player stopped playing CDs with these files. So, I searched google for reviews on this DVD player. Some people said that it doesn't play DVD after some time and some said it does not play CDs. I am not sure what exactly wrong with it, but it does not read my CDs. Good Luck."
1,Garbage like Philips,GarbageLike the other negative reviews here .the sucker didn't last more than 4 to 6 months then all the sudden it started to freeze 1st I thought it was a heat issue but it wasn't I also update the firmware still no help. No matter what kind of media or even retail movies I used still no help. AVOID AT ANY COST .Philips 3 months warranty only means the player is build to last between 6 to 8 months only .try the Pioneer Divx player(...)
5,Completely happy,"I got this great product new just for $34.94 and i'm completely satisfied :-))). It plays all my DVD - Region 1, 2 and even custom recorded from PC! I'm not a pro in Electronics but I highly recommend this thingy!"
2,Great but died,"I thought this was a great player -- PAL, all sorts of media formats, etc.-- until it died after a little more than one year with a blinking red power light."
1,Doesn't last,"Lasted 8 months almost to the day, then it died. I won't be buying any more Phillips products if they are all made like this one.Yeah, it's a cheap DVD player, but I feel like I should get at least a couple of years out of any electronic product that I buy, unless it's from the dollar store. You know...you might have better luck buying a dvd player at the dollar store than buying this one!"
1,Poorly made product,"Mine stopped working after about 9 months, and I didn't use it all that much. The labor charge to repair it would be as much as a new player. I have read the reviews, and this seems to be a frequent problem."
5,Decent DVD Player for the price,I have had absolutly no problems with this DVD player. I have owned it for about a year and so far it works great.
2,Worked great while it lasted...,"...which ended up being about 6 months. After that the dvd laser only worked when it felt like it, which wasn't very often. Now it will only play cd's since they use a seperate laser. I'd suggest getting something else, unless you're just wanting one to hold you over."
5,Great product,"I have had this player for about 16 months now. This thing plays everything. It doesn't matter if it's PAL or NTSC. You can set it up to play both. I have only had 1 out of hundreds of DIVX movies not work. As far as some other complaints that I have read here, some of them are not founded. The blue video with component outputs can be fixed by following the setup instructions properly. The disk skipping straight to the menu when you press next chapter only happens on divx files. When you play a movie that's in .avi format (which is only 1 file) of course it's going to return you to the menu. There isn't another chapter to go to. Quality is definitely better if you use component cables vice direct rca connections. But, it's still a fine player for daily use. The blinking red light and NoCD problems I haven't experience yet. Either way, if it fails for this after 16 months of use, then so be it. I'll just go spend the $50 and buy another one."
3,"Great player, terrible warranty","As far as playing a lot of formats, this player cant be beat for the price. But beware, the warranty is only 90 DAYS when you buy it brand new! That kind of puts the player in the ""junk"" category. This player has playback issues with DVD+RW media, the picture freezes. When I put the same disc in another player it plays smooth. Also, when you fast-forward or fast-reverse through an XVid or Divx file, the picture becomes real jittery when you resume play. I would never buy this player used, buy it brand new. They dont seem to have much life.This player can be easily made region-free by opening the tray, hit 7 8 9 OK 0 buttons on the remote. You will see a ""0"" on the screen in the lower left corner. Great trick for playing region 2 PAL discs"
1,Disposable,Lasted about 8 months. Door is stuck closed. No release mechanism from the outside. looks like I'm going to crack it open and dive in.....
1,Died after 15 months,"Like many people, I had no problems with this DVD player and would have given it a positive review up until today. However, approximately 15 months after purchase, it died. There was no warning. Now, a red light flashes and I get a high pitched sound; nothing works. I had to dismantle the unit to extract the DVD that was inside.From reading reviews this is far from an isolated case. Mine actually lasted longer than many others.If you do purchase this product, be aware that it probably will not last much longer than a year."
1,Eats DVDs,"Worked just fine for the first nine months or so, then one day, shut itself down with a DVD still inside it. No response from machine, no way whatsoever to retrieve my (rented) DVD. This is the second Philips DVD player I've purchased, and both have had problems. Not very good products, it appears."
1,DEAD after only 1 year,"I bought this DVD player after my Sony player died prematurely. Is it just me, or are DVD players supposed to have a longer life?? This DVD player looks nice and works fine when it is working. The player is a bit noisy when reading the discs, though. But the bottom line is that it just stopped working after only 1 year of use. I expected an improvement over my Sony player and I am sorely disappointed."
2,Mine broke after 7 months and 1 day,"good while it lasted, POS broke yesterday for no reason, won't read anything i put in it, phillips customer service was no help, I have to buy and new dvd player... and it won't be a phillips."
2,"DEAD, DEAD, DEAD","I loved this player until it DIED after less than 6 months! Possibly an overheating issue... ""No disc"" for DVD's. It will still play audio cd's, svcd's and vcd's. I'm giving it 2 stars since it's great if it works."
3,Broke down in 6 months,"We got this DVD player as a gift. Worked pretty well before it broke down. I called customer service, they gave me addresses of repair shops in my area, but when I called them they all said they don't do DVD player repairs, just TVs. So I didn't have a repair shop that can do a warranty repair work for Philips DVD player. I wanted to get out the rental DVD disc that got stuck inside and I showed it to the local repair shop (for $30!) and they said that microchip burned down and it would cost $190 to repair it!If it didn't broke down after 6 months of use I would give it 5 stars..."
1,Price is attractive but Quality is cheap,"Hi,I bought Philips DVD player DVP 642 in Dec'04 through Amazon. For the amount that I paid, I thought it was great. Played very well with little issues. But one fine day it threw ""No Disc"" message for all the DVDs that I tried on. So I thought perhaps the lens is dirty and cleaned it up but to no avail. So, I called up the Customer Service center and they advised me to contact their authorized service center nearby. When I contacted I was told that they would charge $40 for the repair work.I did some research in the net and found that there are quite a few people who have had this problem with Philips DVP 642 model.My advice is to spend a little more money and buy a quality DVD player far better than this one. Although the price is attractive, affordable etc its not really worth it. Also the customer service is horrible. You will have to wait for a longtime before someone attends your call."
5,Does what it says,I've used it to watch Region 2 and 4 DVDs with no problems. The remote is flimsy and hard to use but for the price well worth the money
3,Inexpensive; Plays PAL discs,"I like this player so far. I replaced a <1yr old Sony DVD changer with this player. It works very well connected through component outputs to my HD TV and trough coaxial audio to the receiver. There are some setup issues, e.g. when a disc starts subtitles are on, even though subtitles are set to OFF in the system menu. I also could not figure out how to set it up to display full screen on my 4:3 HD TV - all options 4:3 PanScan, 4:3 Letter Box and 16:9 result in the same picture with black bars on top and at the bottom. The player is connected through component inputs so this may be overriding the menu settings.I wanted this player because it plays PAL discs on NTSC TVs and had pretty good reviews from others."
1,Short lifespan,"The player worked fine for six months but now has gone south.After playing a while, the player freezes, sometimes with a totally pink screen,sometimes just the picture currently played - forever.Remote control will not work upon unit freeze.Occasionally it will allow a quick reverse and then play and will continue.Most frequent event is complete freeze followed by turning itself off.One must then restart the DVD and jump to just before the freezepoint and then continue to play. Sometimes to the end, sometimes for ten seconds.This is a throwaway item."
1,Don't waste your money,"I plugged the DVD player in straight out of the box and knew at that moment that this was going to suck. The tray did not open or close smoothly. I've probably used it no more than 3 times and already thinking about chucking it. When I try to insert a DVD the tray does not close properly and moves in and out. And when I finally do get it to load after tinkering with it for 30 minutes, it says ""No Disc"". The cheap price of this is not worth the hassle. You'll end up buying a new one anyway."
2,It is not built to last,"I bought it in December and it died the following October. It powers up but does not respond anymore. the disk is very hard to remove. A lot of time, it shuts down by itself. The Infrared remote has very limited range and it pretty needs a direct path to the machine's infrared receiver."
5,Item is as expected,"Sure the remote is kinda crappy, but it has a lot to do with the fact that it has to work within a file structure that might contain several divx files. i love this item so far."
5,Plays AVI Files on CDs,"DIVX and XVID are supported, that is so great, If I have a movie thats a AVI File, I can burn it on one 700MB CDR Disc and it will play in the dvd player :), very easy to understand menu system and will play everything so far."
3,A good deal,"I found it to be good Divx player but not an excellent one. It is good for Divx/Xvid/DVD/mpeg-2 but the quality for asf is bad with no sound and it seems that it does not support wmv files (got a codec error!!).The controls are not so good and if u r looking for only a DVD player, then I won't recommend u to buy this one.But for a Divx player, I would say that it is not so bad, the price is low and the quality for Divx/Xvid movies is good. Even though the controls for Divx/XVid are not so good but for this price, it is harder to find a better product than this one"
3,first one did not work when it arrived,I had to send the first one back because it just would not turn on. Luckily i was able to get through to Amazon's US customer service. I really hope they don't switch to India as i have heard they are. Please note i have nothing against India. It just seems that when companies out source their customer service to there they often do so to only save money. It is probably an issue of lack of both training and empowerment. Not to mention the we (Americans) tend to have different expectations from customer service reps.
1,Same as others...,"'NO DISK' error after 4-5 months of use. Called support line, wanted $40 for refurbished unit to replace origional. CRAP."
2,mechanism so loud you can hear it over the film,"I recently purchased this model from a source outside amazon. It is easily unlocked to play all region dvds and the picture quality is excellent, however, the unit would only work using the S video connector, not separate connections. the spinning of the dvd itself was ridiculously loud."
5,perfect for what I need,"This is not the best DVD player ever for picture quality etc, but it is Region Free. It will play PAL discs to my NTSC TV. I got it as a Christmas Present and I immediately ordered Blake's 7 from Amazon.co.uk and it plays just fine. You can tell that it had been opened and adjusted, but it was put neatly back into the box and I have not had any problems with it. It also plays all my other Region 1 disks as well (including Region Code Enhanced disks) so if you aren't too particualar about the quality (which is not terrible) you could probably just use this player for all you DVD playing. For me it will do to play my non-region one discs, but I'll keep my Sony for Region 1 stuff. I am very pleased with this product."
4,So far so good,"After our old DVD player broke after three years of use, I was looking for a cheap replacement that would last until the new HD-DVD and Blue Ray DVD players start coming out and are affordable. And so far this DVD player works fine. DVD players don't vary much in what they are able to do and I don't yet know if this player will last so I can't give it five stars. If it keeps performing as well as it does though, I'll probably bump it up to five especially considering the price."
1,Lousy reliability,It worked as advertised for about 4 months. It now won't recognize any disc type inserted. This is apparently a common problem for this model. It's no coincidence that the warranty is only good for 3 months.
3,Phillips Player,"My husband and I have two of these players. They had always worked incredibly well and played whatever we put in. However, we got an HD tv set and decicded to buy component video cables to take advantage. Unfortunately we had problems with the component video on both sets. I would recommend another set from this one if you want to hook up this way."
4,"Good, but no volume","This is quite a good DVD player, but it suffers from not having a volume control on the remote."
5,Love it!,"This is a great DVD at a great price. It was highly rated by Consumer Reports and we love it. It's slim and lightweight, so easy to fit into your components. The picture and playing capabilities are awesome and it even has a mute button that works with our stereo. This was much cheaper than other comparably rated products--a great value--we bought 2, 1 for the living room and 1 for the bedroom."
1,Dead after 6 months,"Worked fine for the 1st six months, then the DVDs just stopped spinning. Not happy."
1,Component Output does not work (Two Units),The component Output did not work on an original unit I ordered and on a replacement unit that was sent. There is a serious flaw with units of recent manufacture. I Own the same unit that was purchased in 2003 and it has performed flawlessly.Serious Quality Control Problem!!!
3,fine but not cheap,"is a good dvd player, just the remote control can be a bit unfriendly. it is just not that cheap, especially considering that the prices for Dvd have fallen so drastically"
1,BEWARE!,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PLAYER! Its crap I had mine for three weeks THREE WEEKS and now its dead.
4,Not bad,I didn't expect too much out of this dvd player and I was pleasently surprised. The reason for purchasing this dvd player was for Divx movies. This player plays all Divx and some Xvid movies. For Xvid that don't play I converted them to divx and they worked just great.
4,"good player, just few settings will make it best player","This is the best player i have ever come accross. im testing this product for past one week and im satisfied witht he features. It plays SVCD, CD, MP3, DiVX, DVD-r almost all.But while testing DiVX initially there was some with picture, like picture get disturbed when there is fast movement on the movei and audio-video Sync problem. But few setting has solved the problem.Another problem was, after copying .VOB file(drag n drop) to DVD-R, no audio is coming, but picture is clear. Can anybody help me"
2,Disapointing,"I am a great fan of Tangerine Dream's music from the 70's.This double CD is different, and like in previous cases in which vocal music is included, the results are less than expected.There are some nice TD electronic pieces, but in all it is disapointing.From the more recent albums, Mota Atma is much more in the classic TD spirit."
4,King of the Ring 1994 review,"All the quarter-final matches were pretty good/smash-mouth brwals. The World Championship between Bret Hart & Diesel(Kevin Nash) was a solid,entertaining back-and-forth bout. The semi-final matches were nice back-and-forth bouts. The Tag Team Championship match between The Haedshrinkers & The Team of Crush and Yokozuna was a pretty much a power brawl but still a match to enjoy. The K.O.T.R finals was just as good as the rest of the matches in the tournament. The Jerry Lawler-Roddy Piper match was a sloppy,poor brawl. I give this event a 7 out of 10."
2,Great if you are starting/ running a swim team,"First, this book was written with good intentions, and if you are starting a swim team or other organizations and you want to avoid dealing with shady people, etc. I would recommend reading it. However if you are looking for a book with general Not-for-Profit information in it, I felt this book fell short for me. The summary and all the similar glowing comments led me to buy the book, but in my opinion, the book is not well organized, and doesn't really provide the general information I was looking for to help my NFP knowledge. My Not-for-Profit is not in the sports arena, and so a good portion of the book wasn't really relevant. Kudos to the author however for her advocacy for safety of our young ones!"
3,Great for school organizations,I bought this hoping for some great information on a Non-profit that I am now managing. This book has great information on how to work with a non-profit involving schools or childrens activities. I could only use some of the information for my purposes.
2,poor quality control on item,"I ordered this phone for my 96 year-old father and had it shipped to my sister to install for him. The handset cord would not even stay in the handset, so she had to take the old phone handset and switch them out. Therefore, not satisfied with manufacturing and quality control. The ring light on the phone and not even be seen unless you are looking straight down at it or in the dark. The ringer is louder than the old phone he had, so it has resolved the problem of him not hearing the phone. The program (memory) numbers are easy for him to use and numbers on set are very large."
4,For the price it is great,"This is the second one I have purchased for my aunt, she can hardly see. She seems to like it fine, and for the price I think it serves its purpose. It has the biggest numbers I could find. The emergency keys she does not use."
4,Non-Informational Response,"Seems fine. Have plugged it in and done nothing else with it. Is an emergency phone for an elderly person. She seems quite happy and hopes not to have to use it. So, this rating is probably about as non-informational as you could ask for. I will say this: It has very big buttons."
1,Big Button Phone,"This is the second one of these phones I've purchased for my mom, who has macular degeneration. The first one worked for a number of years, so I bought her this phone a second time. I was not pleased with the new phone. The cord did not fit securely into the hand set, so the connection wasn't consistent. When the connection wasn't made, the phone didn't work at all. Luckily, we still had the old phone, so I hooked up the handset from the old phone to the new phone. It works, but I shouldn't have had to do that. I would have sent it back if I'd had more time, but I don't. Too big a hassle getting it repackaged and taken to the post office. So, the phone is working and mom is happy to have her big button phone again, but I won't order it again."
4,good practical phone,"The phone has nice large letters; one can feel the shape of the letters with the fingertips. For our use, we need a phone that displays a visible flashing light, when the phone is ringing. This phone has the visible flashing light; the only draw back is the ringer does not have the capability to totally turn off. Otherwise, the phone is great, for what it is."
1,piece of junk,"received second/replacement phone for the first one that didn't work. entire insides were rattling and sliding around, and of course it didn't work. been over a month since first ordering-still nothing. bought for my 88 year old father who is in nursing home. guess he'll just have to keep using pay phone in the hallway.will never buy anything from JR or amazon again. save your time and money--just go to the store and buy what you want."
1,Terrible as wall phone,When the phone was on the wall the 'hang-up' feature was terrible. Turning around a piece of plastic DOES NOT create a viable way to hang up for a visually handicapped person.Avoid this phone for a visually-handicapped person's wall use!
2,Poor discription!!!,"Didn't know that this phone needs 2xAA batteries. I bought this for my Aunt, she can't hold the phone with her hand, therefore she can only use the speaker phone. But unfortunately, the volume is very low (I've turn to the loudest). So....this phone is useless to her. Beside, it is hard for her to change the batter as well. I have to return this product and purchase and other phone.The big button is good, but she didn't like the look. Well. I'll only give this phone a 2 stars...if the speaker phone is loud enough I'll give a 3 stars."
4,Good special needs phone for the price,"This phone is solid. It reminds me of the phones that were issued by Ma Bell way back when. It has good sound quality, easy to use and intuitive controls. I bought it for my father who is hard of hearing. It's not as loud as I had expected; hence, 4 stars instead of 5."
4,Great phone for price,"I bought this phone for my 87-year old mother and her only complaint (and she always has them) is that it does not ring loud enough. Of course, she does not have a hearing-aid and insists she doesn't need one, but the phone is hard for her to hear over the blasting TV."
4,big button telephone,I bought this phone for my mother because of failig eye sight she is very happy with it.
1,Plain and simple.........JUNK!!!!!!!,Phone arrived and was anxious to hook it up for my mother....it has some kind of shirt internally and was able to hear the dial tone for less than 1 second and that was it.......JUNK!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!!
4,It made my Mom happy...,"I got this for my 90 year old Mom, and she likes it very much. Caller ID would make it perfect. The programmable emergency keys are especially helpful."
1,Large number phone,"This brand new phone was unacceptable because there was not even a dial tone when plugged in. At the very least, this phone should have been tested before it was packaged. Very disappointed in this product, simply because someone decided to skip testing this product before sending to their customer. The time lost with back and forth shipping and then buying a phone locally was not worth doing business with this company."
1,Cheap phone,Received from Amazon Fulfillment from third party seller. Inoperable out of the box. No dial tone with or without batteries. Handset cord kept falling out of handset. Returned to Amazon for refund - wouldn't trust a replacement.
1,poor sound quality,"After six months, we have taken this phone out of service. We blamed (wrongly) Magic Jack and the Internet for noisy, unclear sound because we assumed a Bell phone would be solid. It was not. As I recall, it took a long time to ship. Upon arrival, it did not work at all, until we found that the handset cable was not plugged in completely. That small stuff was no big deal. What amazed us was that when we plugged a new wireless phone set into the Magic Jack the sound quality was excellent: crisp and clear. Sadly, this particular Bell phone had very poor sound quality."
1,Garbage,"Yes, it's cheap, so I guess I shouldn't expect much. The speakerphone part worked, but the handset/receiver never worked straight out of the box. It was not worth shipping back and paying $7.00 for postage. It's going to go into the trash."
1,defective phone,"As soon as I received the phone, I connected. Appearance of phone looked good with big number and wide range of volume control on the side of the phone. However, phone receiver did not work at all. I could make phone call only through speaker, and even speaker I have to press more than twice to hear the tone."
5,speakerphone,"The phone has a speaker phone with large numbers, well designed with buttons for fire and ambulance to program.Was pleasantly surprised to find it as the phone did not come up when I last searched for speaker phones.Had one of these before about fifteen years ago and wanted to find another one when that one no longer worked but could not, so this was a pleasant surprise."
3,big number phone,This phone is a good one.My trouble with it is my own voice seems to be amplified in the handset.
1,AT&T Big Button Phone,"I ordered this phone for my mother who is 96 years old and in a nursing home. She needed a big phone with big numbers, so I thought this would be perfect for her. When I received the phone I took it to her and we tried four different jacks at her facility and we couldn't get a dial tone. I brought the phone back to my house and hooked it up and the phone never got a dial tone. I contacted Amazon to report that the phone could not be used and was defective and they denied any type of guarantee for the product. If I wanted to send it to AT&T, it would be at my own expense plus an additional charge which would have exceeded the cost of the phone. I promised to never use Amazon again."
5,Mom & Daughter's Delight,"My 3-yr old daughter LOVES coloring and LOVES Disney Princesses. I love that I don't have to clean my TV, rugs, windows, table, her face ......"
4,Pleased,"The book arrived before expected - great service.The book is a convenient field size.The organization is acceptable, with detailed bird info separated from plates.The plates and maps are associated together.A useful field guide, I am pleased with the purchase."
5,Satisfaction,"Whaoo this apparatus is one of the best i never used. I was astonished of the result i got from this Oster Fast Feed Clipper. I will encourage you to try this, and you will see the result"
1,Did not include any of the accessories,"Upon receipt of this combo, the boxes did not include any of the accessories (blades, etc) that were indicated as included on the boxes and in the description."
3,Not sure if they 're worth what you pay,They 're not bad just don't think that they are worth $120.00. The Oster nametagfell off after using them twice. I bought this set of clippers to replace a set of Andisclippers. Which were about a third the cost. I should have stuck with the Andis again.They say heavy feed. I see no difference between this and the Andis.
2,Clippers,I thought these clippers would give a close cut but not I guess they are good for fades but not to use if you are trying to achieve the bald look!!!
3,Not too keen,"They were supposed to replace hair cuts for me and save some money. Now they just sit on the shelf. Better than Wal*art quality, but not like the barbers."
4,An excellent overview of most of the bicycle incarnations.,I have been buying these for several years. I love bicycles and the various forms they have taken over the years. I have yet to see as thorough a treatment of the subject of bicycles as are in these pages. A wonderful testimony to the ingenuity of mankind.
2,academic incest,"This is a manditory text on Roger's nursing model. A good example of ""ever learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth."" Malinksi churns, restates, and elevates Rogers, but like her mentor, rejects the scrutiny of logical positivism and empiricism without apology. The goyim of traditional science like Aristotle, Descartes, Einstein and Popper are ignored out of hand. This is the philisophy of phenomenology without phenomena. Qualitative research becomes mystical. Inclusion of Rogerian theory denegrates the metaparadyme of nursing concepts as well as public perception of the verity and relevance of the profession. Two stars is for format, style and effort."
3,Could do better,"This is not a bad book, and perhaps lives up to its ""How-To"" title for a number of beginners questions. However, little depth is given beyond simple ""do this, do that"" answers in the form of fairly long examples.Much more useful would be short, to-the-point discussions about the problem, the important issues to think about when facing such a problem, and a clear, concise example.The inclusion of nearly 200 pages of a one sentence description of the JDK 1.2 API is fairly pointless. Coupled with illegible text screen dumps of grey text on a black background in a figure of about 1.5in by 4in, I have to recommend buying a different book."
5,Way to Live,I ordered several of these books for my Youth Group. I am very pleased with the book and it came in great condition!!
3,more jam,"Although well made, this is a rather bland jam. Neither the apricots nor the almonds stand out in flavor."
2,Too simplistic for usage beyond general terms,"In my work as a translator I am always using my dictionary as a reference tool. Although this one is fairly new, it lacks a lot of the depth needed to truly understand a word or concept beyond extremely general words. The set up used by Oxford-Hachette with their French and Spanish dictionaries would be much more convenient (i.e. the addition of commonly used phrases and concept explanations) for anyone looking at this book. Unfortuantely, because Romanian is not one of the more popular languages out there, the amount of good reference material is quite limited."
3,Helpful for study.,"This paperback book is a convenient size to carry. It includes pronunciation guide in the front for both English and Romanian readers which is very helpful. I just wish it included more words. There have been several words I've tried to look up that I've been unable to find.I've only seen two Romanian-English English-Romanian dictionaries and this is the better of the two. But I do not think the value is as good with this book as with the other Romanian study books I've purchased. Still, if you need a Romanian-English dictionary, you will find this helpful."
1,Sub-standard and frustrating,If your command of either one of thesse languages is above second grade do not bother to buy or even borrow this dictionary. It seems as if the author glanced quickly over the Andrei Bantas dictionary (the real one to be treasured) and put overnight a real cheap and dim paperback.
2,At least it's cheap,"Probably the best thing you'll get for this price in Amazon, which does not mean it's good. In fact it's very poor. I'll probably follow the suggestions I've been reading everywhere: Romanian dictionaries should be bought from Romanian editors.But since I had no English-Romanian/Romanian-English dictionary and this one's not too expensive, then it's ok."
1,Work a couple time,"I bought this DVD burner a few weeks ago. Used nero to burn CD/DVDs.After 12 DVDs it stopped burning, giving the same failure error message. ""Session Fixation Error"". It then opens up with a now ruined DVD. A quick Google search revealed that I wasn't the only one with a BenQ1620 with this error. I used BenQ's support email form and still have not heard back. I upgraded the firmware, cleaned the lens, no luck. When any dvd is loaded now, it will only read it half the time. It still burns CDs, and reads data cds and audio cds.Not reccomended unless you like wasting time and turning blank DVDs into trash."
4,European client,"The item itself has a CD and a DVD. I didn't appreciate the CD being only c21mins and the DVD being American play only. Whilst I can play the DVD on my PC, my DVD player is European given I live in the UK. Other American supplied items have had European region playable media.The music is as expected and I knew 2 tracks courtesy of ChillFM. A great radio station for relaxing music. The music itself is 5 stars but it is the letdown on the media and it being a tad short."
4,Nice but not truly sailable,"The boats are cool, but not truly sailable. Also, they come in only one frequency, so you can only drive one at a time. But, they are fast and fun to play with. My three year old niece and nephew learned to drive them."
1,Dickie Speleug RC Sailboat twin motor,My first RC toy sailboat Sank on the third day and trial in the yard pond. Ran aground on the edge and sank by the stern. Fried the RC controls because they are not water protected and the hull had ZERO floation. Store refuned money. It also was supposed to come with rechargable batteries. Did not. Had an attachable keel with some keel weight. Some models shown have a rudder mine did not and was unable to use the wind to sail. It was fun but for a few dollars 25$ more the Sea Lite with motor was much more fun and durable and it has a rudder and trimable sails by RC this boat does not. It is a small pool toy and delicate and easy to sink and destroy and I enjoyed playing with it while it lasted which is why it is on the to fix someday pile. I would suggest anyone buying this put silicon sealer on the electronics and styrofoam floation in the hull too.
3,Simba Radio Control Sailboat,"The batteries were difficult to install and required a special screwdriver. After using the remote, the propeller got stuck, so it has been in the ""repair pile"" since its first use."
1,"Bad Camera, Bad Customer Service",This cam does not work with Win XP even though they say it does. I tried installing it on 2 computers. I couldn't get it to work on either one. I went to the website and tried all the patches and downloads. Nothing worked. I contacted customer support and they told me the same thing as the website. When I told them I tried that already they never emailed me back.Don't waste your money.
5,Not blurry,This cam has a fixed focal point which means you must be at that distance from your subject or the subject will be blurred. Holding the camera still will also affect the stability of the picture.
4,"Stone is very pretty, but...","The stone in this ring is very pretty, but the 14k gold band is pretty lightweight and kinda cheap feeling, plus after I got it I didn't like the look of the gold band with the purple stone. It would look better if the band was white gold or sterling, but my fault, I saw the photo. The stone is why I bought this and the price, so I guess for the price you get what you pay for. I may look for another setting to put the stone into and then think I would be happier with it. But the stone itself is beautiful, and if you're set on gold, you'll love it."
3,it's ok,I bought the DVD just to listen to the DVD audio sound. It wasn't that much better than the regular mp3. I'm keeping it as souvenir but would not buy another DVD.
1,Had to trash it,This product was supposed to smell like heliotrope. It wasn't even close. It smelled like cheap dimestore perfume. It's now in the trash.
5,2nd time's the charm,"Even though the set is now out of print, the replacement discs are still available as of Dec 2009. As promised, the correct title cards are in place. What's more interesting, Disney has dropped its PC pretensions re: The Night Before Christmas and restored the ""offensive"" Amos and Andy sequence (which only lasts about 10 seconds). There has also been some minor reordering of the selections.If you own the original discs and haven't replaced them, it's definitely worth calling Disney Customer Service (the phone number is listed in some previous reviews) and get them (and the customer service rep even knew about the problem with the original discs- no lengthy explanation was necessary)."
4,walt disney treasures - more silly symphonies,"walt disney treasures - more silly symphonies (1929-1938)its a very good product!but, please reedite the volumen 1, I need this, and will like purchased this new, not from others members, is only a DVS, cartoons with tin case, nothing more, IS NOT GOLD!!GASTÓN"
5,Dream Thief is breathtaking.,"This book is a great addition to the collection of lawhead books. It has a strong christian background, and keeps the reader thourougly interested."
3,Not too bad,"This is a pretty good book. It is one of Lawhead's earlier works, and does not have the depth of some of his later stuff. However, it is a pretty intriguing story with the classic battle between good and evil. I really liked the main characters struggle with the religion of his parents. It is something that we all have to face, and it is very realistic in this book. The bad guys were pretty nasty, which makes it pretty suspenseful. I would recommend that you read this book before you read any of Lawhead's later works, or you might be disappointed, but it has overall good story content."
4,Science Fiction with a New Spin,"Who would have thought that a combination of science fiction christianity would ever exist in a book. Grant it, Star Trek and Star Wars have themes which touch on religion. However, neither bases the story on Chrsitianity. The Dream Thief addresses the question of religion's existance on other planets.It is true that we know life does not exist on Mars. It is also unlikely that any life form is capable of producing the technology that exists in this book. However, if you suspend this disbelief, the book is enjoyable. The story includes a dream experiment which leads to the discovery of life on Mars, and the lead character's (Spence) discovery of his faith in God through his subsequent exploration of the Martian Christianity. Another sub-plot also demonstrates Spence falling in love which adds another sunstantial layer to the story.All of these themes make a theme that is truly enjoyable. Even though I am not a fan of fiction, I enjoyed this book."
3,"Entertaining, not Impressive.","If you are looking for easy-reading entertainment with a sci-fi flair, look no farther.However, on a literary level I felt this novel to be sub-par. The character sketches and development are weak, and descriptions in general are shallow and repetitive. (How many times must we hear about ""clear blue eyes,"" ""bouncy locks,"" and people sitting ""in meditation like the classic guru?"" How many times does Reston almost ""faint from exhaustion,"" then ""barely muster the strength to go on"" in the same chapter?)Perhaps this was written before the days of a trusty editor for Lawhead, but I was unimpressed. I suggest finding other sci-fi novels such as ""Ender's Game"" by Orson Scott Card.(For those of you who are drawn to Lawhead for his epics, Ender's game is the beginning of an.. 8(or so?)-volumed one, I believe.)"
3,'..Thief' not quite up to par,"'Dream Thief' isn't as stunning as the rest of Lawhead's work, which is an accomplishment in and of itself given Lawhead's amazing writing ability.It's a nice sci-fi story, but there's nothing extraordinary about it that sets it apart from any other sci-fi novel. It's one of Lawhead's earliest works, so I'm sure it was a growing experience."
2,sterotypical potrayal of indians...,"As a northeastern Indian who read this book, it seems that the author knows jacksquat about the north east of India and Nepal. He seems to have an archaic and colonial view of india as ""pitiful but redeeming"". The story itself wasn't that great either."
3,Dated but a very nice read,"Add an extra 1/2 starI found this an enjoyable read. This was written early in Mr. Lawhead's career and some of the technology now surpasses what is written in this book.Still, like most Lawhead books, the plot lines are excellent, good character development, great pacing and great twists.I can recommend purchasing the book, especially if you are a Lawhead fan."
3,One important correction...,"I just want to amend the previous review -- there is one key member from the original New Riders on these tracks: the lead singer/songwriter John ""Marmaduke"" Dawson."
4,It actually works!,"I actually built this computer in 1974-75 for a high school science fair project - it not only worked, but garnered several awards. I still have some of the components somewhere, probably because I invested too much time and sweat to throw them out, but I don't know what happened to the book. I think it would still make for a successful science fair project today, but bear in mind that it took me over a year to complete. As I recall, the instructions were easy to understand and reasonably implementable (I changed a few things), but this is not a job for someone with limited patience or commitment. A great memory nonetheless..."
4,Good book for restoration,"I needed a service manual for a restoration project. The book helped with finding out how certain components were supposed to be installed. Also adjustments and service procedures such as replacing fork oil, adjusting brake shoes, etc... There were a few things I needed that weren't included, but overall very helpful in my project. It would have been more helpful if I were rebuilding the transmission and/or engine instead of simply painting the frame and reassembling the bike. It did give information about inspecting components and determining damage or need for adjustments. I thought this book was a good value for me."
4,Shonen Knife returns better than ever!,"The Knife's latest outing is a return to the feel- good pop that made me fall in love with their quirky music in the first place. How can you resist a band that sings about bison, public baths, chocolate and cornflakes?From the opening cut (strongly recalling the opening cut from ""Secret no. 712"") to the wonderful food of ""Sushi Bar"" (and yet another song about chocolate!) this is a lighthearted romp only the most jaded should avoid! TURN IT UP and GET THE KNIFE!!!"
3,Not so happy hour,"I am a fan of Shonen Knife, but not this album (which I bought at the same time as the vastly better Brand New Knife). While technically not a terrible album, but by the standards the Osaka Japan trio have set, just a little.The first two tracks are fun, but the rest of the album kinda dwindles from there. I accually enjoy this scatagorical nature of their music and even songs about food and fluffy bunnies. But this album was not a good mix in regards to pop and rock that they have done so well at before.If you like Shonen Knife, yes pick up the album there is enough there to justify buying it. But if this is your first Shonen Knife album, you might want to consider Lets Knife or Brand New Knife."
2,lacklustre,"I'm worried that Shonen Knife have kind of grown old quickly. I'm not sure that ""Sushi Bar"" or ""Hot Chocolate"" are any less poignant than ""Twist Barbie"" or ""Big Baka Guy,"" but it's been a long time and it all sounds the same... Even the whimsical cover of ""Daydream Believer"" is too reminicent of their briliant reinterpretation of ""On Top of the World.""Their kick is/was that they were shocking and cute all at the same time. But that kind of gimmick only lasts for so long.I'm thinking that I probably won't be paying too much more attention to Shonen Knife unless they somehow recreate themselves... shocking and less cute, maybe? Maybe torch songs, or a blues album... that would do it."
1,Need a life.,"This man needs to find more things to do with his time, other than writing garbage like this. Thanks to him and his book I now find myself a little less intelligent for wasting my time reading it."
4,A Good Primer,"This book has become my go-to for my English classes. Davenport moves quickly and thoroughly through parts of speech and then onto diagramming, step-by-step. The only downside is that there is not a ton of practice, but I can find that a number of places. I would be great if the book came with a DVD with the diagrams (I've converted it all to powerpoint) and more practice. Love her sense of humor!"
1,May be right for you,"If you like diagramming and want to read about it, this is the book for you. If you want to learn to diagram, this is not the book for you. After a few false starts I discoveredGrammar by Diagram - Understanding English Grammar Through Traditional Sentence Diagramming, which taught me what I wanted to know. I ordered Grammar by Diagram and the accompanying Workbook from the publishers website because, at the time, Amazon was selling it for a seventy dollar premium. Perhaps now the Amazon price is more reasonable."
2,Not for home gardeners,This book is written for professional gardeners. The terminology is not understandable for the average person. Its a shame because it's obvious the author is an expert but instructions for hydrangea care are not in conversational American English. There were terms I even looked up in the dictionary but didn't apply. There must be a private gardening language!
5,Hydrangea Heaven,"This book brings my favorite flower into my home where they have difficulty thriving as live blossoms.Thanks for everything I ever wanted to know about them, and some beautiful photography!Mary in Phoenix"
2,For Horticulturalists Only,"Full of beautiful pictures and containing much helpful information, one would think that this book is the perfect resource for home gardening enthusiasts and hydrangea lovers. However, the most important information for gardeners without a degree in horticulture is the USDA Hardiness zone. In my opinion, without this information, the book is useless. I had high hopes that this book would contain it all; I was sorely disappointed. Keep searching unless you just want to add one more hydrangea book to your collection."
3,Master gardener,Beautiful photos but disappointed that the name wasn't on the picture- was cumbersome to go between the list of names and the photos
2,Needs reformatting,"While this CD-Rom is pretty good as far as content and info, the format really needs an overhaul. The window overall is too small. Something like 6x6, which makes for smaller images. And there is no way to enlarge any of the images. Also, navigation needs to be more intuitive. It's not very user friendly to go back and forth between fields for information. Praise is given for content, but one would be better off with a book version."
3,Sticky,"I love the Peter Thomas Roth 10% glycolc acid moisturizer lotion. I use that regularly. So, a year ago I purchased this thinking that I would like it as a serum. Nope. It feels sticky on my face and does not have the ""working"" feel that the moisturizer has. It's a pass for me."
3,right now disappointed,"This was supposed to be a 10% glycolic and yet the samples I have from Paula's choice that are much less are much more ""tingly"" on my face. at this point.. I would not buy this again."
1,Piece of Junk!!,This thing is a big waste of money and time. My son is so frustrated that the suction cups won't stay on the wall OR stay attached to the toy. I am going to throw it away.
1,Save your money,"I bought this toy for my one-year-old son who loves bathtime. I thought he would love watching how the water flows between each piece. However, before even using the toy once, every piece had fallen down. The suction cups do not keep the toy stuck to tile. So, we cannot use the toy as designed. He has played with the individual pieces in the tub once or twice, but he doesn't love it and prefers the old bath toys to this new junky one."
2,Disappointing,"Great idea, poor follow through. Several of the suction cups are curled backward and can not suction to the wall making it frustrating and nearly impossible to get it to stick to the wall long enough to build the whole structure and pour water through it."
1,Reeve & Jones water works,"This item is way to much money for what you get. This is JUNK!!! The suction cups fall off,If they do stick they do not stick very well. Very Unhappy with this product!!!"
1,Extreme disappointment.,"This toy does not actually work. The pipe fittings are not designed to allow the pieces to be connected, the suction cups that hold the pieces to the tub fall off continually, and the valve does not actually open far enough to allow sufficient water to flow through. It is a poor design from top to bottom. This toy will offer only frustration for your young ones (and you). Do not make the same mistake that I did. Avoid this ""toy"" at all costs."
3,"Great concept, poor design","Just purchased this toy for my 4 year old son. LOVED it as he was taking out each piece from the box, very excited as he mounted each section with the suction cups on the wall but quickly became frustrated with the suction cups not holding and the spout not staying secure in the fitting. Purchased it at a great discount and was able to further educate him by using white teflon plumbing tape to fix the fitting problem. Overall still a good toy but with the suction cups and fitting issues and the fact that rarely do the wheels turn when the water passes it leaves some to be desired. I would purchase again just because he spends ALOT of time with it but only if on sale and would hope a better design comes out in the future."
2,Had to send it back!,"Although my son would've loved to design a water track in the tub with this, some of the suction cups were warped, and none of them would stick because our tiles have grout lines and and are slightly textured. It just wouldn't work on our tub. We were disappointed! We did like the look of all the pieces though, so if it fits in your tub, then it would probably be lots of fun!"
3,ok,"HiI bought this for my two boys aged 6 and 8. They do like it but a couple of things. You do need smooth tiles or glass else it doesn't stick on at all. The suction cups don't all always work (but there are plenty of pieces so its not a show stopper). The pieces that fit into each other can be struggle to fit and may not stay in well but you can work around this. Overall, it is robust and it has a lot of variety. If you combine it with other pouring and catching receptacles then it has plenty of scope for play. I think its good value for money and one of the better ones of this type of toy. What it is excellent for, is entertaining older children who enjoy bath/shower time still. There aren't many good toys for this age group."
3,So so bath toy,"I had to jump in. We have had this toy for years and used it quite a bit, but it was always a disappointment. The suctions cups stick, but only to a smooth surface and of course if you have tiles ate are spaces in between and the fixed distances between the suction cups on the toys do not always fit and... you see where I am going. There were ways around the problem, but it severely limited how we could use it. Really there was only one way to set it up. Most people have four inch tile. If they had just designed with that in mind... Also the water flow wasn't as much as was needed to spin all the little wheels.So still searching for the perfect interactive bath toy."
5,A Great Toy,I got this for my 5 year old twins and my 3 year old. They all love this toy! We have no problems with the suction cups not sticking. They all love to play with this in the bath. I think it is a great buy for the money!
5,a good read,"I like all of her books they have enough action to keep anyone interested, and are a lot of fun.I do like mind candy! and if you pay attention, they even make sense in the ""real world""this is one of those books I would have told my daughter she could not read, so that she and her friends would have sneaked into the library and read it when they thought I was not watching."
4,Fun story from Patricia Wrede,"This is an early work from Patricia Wrede republished for the Kindle. I bought this book when it was first published, but initially abandoned it because of its slow start. I eventually read the book, but only after reading more of Wrede's books that i liked. I was charmed by the electronic explanation of how she re-wrote the beginning to improve the flow. A good story and a much better beginning. It's not as enjoyable as her Talking with Dragons series, but well-worth the time to read."
4,re-read this like an old friend every few years,"This mass market paperback has the worst cover - I almost didn't pick it up because of it - but there must have been something about the story on the back that sounded interesting and it would have been my loss if I hadn't read it, but oh man, whenever I read the scene in the middle relating to the picture on the front I have an involuntary eye roll at how ridiculously incorrectly tarted up it was drawn. I find this a sweet, escapist story with some magic and a little adventure and mysticism, suitable for a variety of ages, a great heroine and some good lads, some good lords and some bad lords, shadowy bad creatures, etc. I pick this up every few years and re-read it and I'm always happy to see it. Must read more by Patricia Wrede."
5,Fear is the Best,I really liked this show...Hope Season 2 and others come out soon...This is the Best of these type of shows!
5,My Favorite Reality Show,"I am so glad that they're releasing this show to dvd. It's my favorite reality show. When this show first premiered, there was nothing like it on tv. Very creative and intense. I hope they release every season of this suspensful and fun show."
4,Cool,"I am obsessed with The Fear Factor. When I saw that it wad on DVD I had to have it! I'm not a HUGE fan of the first season, because I don't think it's all that ""gross, squirmy, etc"" as the later seasons, but I had to have it. I really wish they would release the rest of the seasons on DVD. I would own them all!"
4,Bring back the memories of being a farm girl . . .,"If you grew up on a dairy farm, this is a great book to read to your kids! I related to this story completely, and when I shared this book with my sisters and old farm pals they wanted to know where they could get a copy. While city kids played in well manicured playgrounds and had a pet, the barn and cows were my playground and pets from the day I was born. In our barn, the radio was always playing - maybe not always music, but also baseball games, farm reports and Paul Harvey.This book is great way to share your childhood with your own kids and also expose them to life growing up in the country."
3,cute book,"depicts dairy farm life, but some the pictures are a little odd--not accurate for real milking situations"
1,smells like a toxic waste dump,"This bag actually looks all right and is well designed. However, there are good bags made in less toxic ways- I put it out on the fire escape for days and now it is hanging in the front hall. Every time I pass it I am reminded that people who work in the factories where this kind of material is used can't get away from the fumes. Too late to return but I am going to be more serious about avoiding the Made in China, cheap goods temptation. Pee- yu!"
5,Great Teacher's Bag,"Perfectly fits my iPad, books, markers and other teacher stuff. It's also quite classy looking and rugged enough for field trips."
1,Nice bag except the zippers have failed within 2 uses,"I purchased this tote bag for a trip and I received it three days ago. I actually love the bag, but the interior zipper failed today (after only a couple days) and the top zipper is looking iffy. The zippers are not good. Otherwise the bag is very nice for the price. But if the zippers fail, then I am stuck with a bag that no longer meets my needs, because I need the zippers. I contacted the seller and asked for help. I hope they stand behind their products. I need to have them send me another one without having to pay any more money, or I might as well have bought a higher priced one that had better zippers!"
5,I love this bag!,"This bag is THE BEST. I bought it in light gray to keep textbooks and materials for tutoring. Everything fits - usually two textbooks, a paperback book and a 1-inch binder in the main pocket; scissors, pens and highlighters in the front pocket; note cards in the inside pocket; and a pop-up speaker in one of the side pockets. I love that the main pocket zips and the front and back pockets velcro closed (and stay closed). The quality is really good, although I've only had it for a few months. (I'll update after the one that gets regular use survives a Chicago winter!) I loved this so much that the red one is my second just for running around when I don't feel like carrying my backpack."
4,LOVED IT.,"Besides the hole at the bottom of my bag (inside, and plus i didn't really care) i love it. I used it as my clinical bag and work bag. Holds a lot of stuff, love the pockets... I'm thinking about getting a new color here soon :)"
4,very useful!,Very comfortable and useful bag. Lots of space inside and two huge external pockets. The color is a sort of dark red but it is nice and now that winter comes is a nice tone of red. Great purchase
3,Nice tote,"While this is a very nice tote bag, it does not look quite like the picture. The bottom is not flat like it shows. All the pockets are very convenient & the material is durable and easy to clean."
5,Perfect work bag,"I love this bag! I work 12 hour shifts in a dispatch center and this is the perfect size to hold personal items, reading material, crafts and my meals. It's easy to clean and I love the adjustable straps so I can carry it on my shoulder. Would definitely buy this again!"
2,This Bag Stinks!,"Functionally, it's a great bag. But it smells like its been soaked in kerosene. (just like my Chinese faux leather shoes) If I can get the stink out, I'll rate it higher."
5,Great Bag,"I just received the bag and haven't even used it yet. I needed a travel bag to hold my hair dryer, mousse, hairspray and hair brush. When the bag arrived, it seemed bigger than I expected, and I wasn't sure it was going to work. But I think it is going to be just perfect. I also didn't think I would really need the extra little pockets, credit card slots, etc. But then I realized another use for the bag would be to take it to the hot springs pool I go to. The bag will hold my towel and clothes, money, chapstick, keys, sunscreen, book, cell phone and all the little extras will have a place. I bought the light grey which looks nice, but I'm going to order another bag in dark red. The fabric will be easy to clean. About the odor of the microfiber; it is not pleasant. I have had it hanging in the basement all week and I think the odor is dissipating a little. I recommend the bag."
2,Not such a good buy,"I was quite disappointed that the fabric actually does not have the shiny appearance as shown in the picture. It looks functional and plain. The bag cost just about $20 after the high shipping and handling charge. Therefore, the price really was not that great."
4,Love the tote for frequent air travel,"All the requirements I was looking for in a travel tote (purse). Outside front pocket with velcro flap for easy access to passport, boarding pass pens, cell phone, and credit cards. Side outside pocket for water bottle, umbrella, or snacks. Zippered main pocket so stuff does not fall out under the seat in front of you. Enough room to have everything you would want on a domestic flight (book, gum, make up, mp3, kleenix, emergency meds) available at your feet without sacrificing all foot room. Back velcroed flap for magazines. Wide shoulder strap for comfort. This should be a great bag for in flight and on the ground. I also carry on a wheeled backpack for items that I cannot afford to loose via checked luggage. This tote is for my ""in flight"" needs and wants- but will make a great shopping tote as well."
3,Strong mildew smell..,"Seems to be a good bag overall. I purchased this travel bag for my elderly mother. She says it will work well, IF she can get the strong mildew smell out of it! It certainly won't be usable for her December trip. If it's not aired out in a couple weeks we'll be returning it."
5,great tote!,"This tote bag is a very nice bag! It is well constructed out of high quality fabric. The size is nice, big enough for a computer and the extra things you might want to carry with you. The price is certainly reasonable for a bag of this quality. I would buy it again and probably will!"
4,"Love this Tote, but not the handles.....","Pros - I have been trying to replace a Tote purse that finally gave in on me, this Tote it was very similar to my previous one, and the reviews were pretty nice. I like purses that are easy to get organized, and it does not fall all over the place. This one is pretty neat, nice, with outside pockets, the two inside pockets are small.Cons - The handles their length is great, they are wide too but the material is harsh to my skin, I would think that if they would be made out of the same material as the rest of the Tote, it would be perfect. So I am taking away 1 star, hoping that in the future the designer will change this, I would definitely purchase another one."
2,Surf the web instead.,"For about three years, I haven't thought about linear algebra at all. But recently, I've been interested in it again, and went to this book for reference.I'm lucky if I can find one nice clear example of anything in this book. This is a proof book all the way, and it's not for your general type of audience. This is bare bones stuff. That's probably why the price is 14 bucks instead of 140.Instead of getting a book like this, I recommend getting a more expensive book that's easier to understand, or just surf the internet for information. I have had some success with the latter option."
1,Worst Math book ever run away!,This is the text book for a linear Algebra class and I really wish I dropped the class because of the book. It's not student friendly because of poor and incomplete discussion of the subject and slim to no examples in the book wit few exercises and even less answers in the back. The book is cheap at around 16.00 but that is to high of a price for poor presentation of the material.
2,Terrible,"this book is terrible, it's confusing and lack of explaination, i recommand u to get the Linear Algebra and it's application by Davie C. Lay"
4,Great book for Paladin PCs.,"This book covered almost every detail about being a paladin, even the roleplaying aspect of it. The book even gave recommendations on books to read and movies to see in order to correctly roleplay a paladin. The one thing I think it should have had was more paladin orders for players below 9th level. If I'm correct 9th level was the lowest level someone was elegible to join an Order. An order for 6th level paladins may have been created to get the ball rolling on Order advancement."
3,Holy Warriors,"The Paladin bar none has the highest standards out of the AD & D 2nd edition character classes. Second edition they remianed tied down to the fighter group. While the Player's Handbook paladin is covered, there is offered several new kits, such as divinates, ghost hunters, inquisitors, squires and wrymslayers. In the fight againsat evil, the paladin stands as good's surpreme undaunted champion. Must be lawful good. Too many ethos violations they ever after are a fighter of the same level. Can turn undead and have access to priest spells. It is a fighter/ cleric."
5,A great resource for paladins!,"This book gives great information on the holiest of warriors, the paladin. It goes into great detail on the role-playing aspects of paladins, as well as explaining their powerful abilities. If you play AD&D, this book is for you."
4,"Very Satisfying, Indeed!","Like many, I became a fan of Michael Falzarano (and Harvey Sorgen) through his work with Hot Tuna. ""Memphis Pilgrims"" was one of Michael's first steps out of the shadow of Jorma and Jack (although Jorma contributes here as well). It's a solid set throughout. The songs themselves are much what you'd expect from a veteran of Hot Tuna and Prof. Louie - it's good, hard-hitting blues rock, delivered with conviction. This is really an outstanding CD, and for the price, you just can't miss. Get this!"
2,Good Encyclopedia for the Seasoned Technician,The technician using this book needs to be competent in Trig and have an excellent pre-existing feel for computers. It is like wading through an encyclopedia of information. I was not impressed with the authors incorrect spelling or altogether wrong information given to the user.
2,Confusing,don't buy it.The author wastes too much time explaining things that you don't need + his writing is not clear.I found myself wondering on what he wanted to explain most of the times.
1,Buy something else!,"This was a dissappointing A+ book. Way too much coverage of irrelevant material, much too technical, and *very* little on Win 95. This one looks like it was adapted to A+ from somewhere else, rather than written for A+. The Exam Prep books are much better at A+, and the Mueller Upgrading & Repairing PCs is much better at the technology. Darn glad I didn't spend my own money for this one."
1,DON'T BUY,"Does nothing but confuse you with poorly written explaintions , which are few and hard to find. Wordy and does not have the memory bank formulaDON'T BUY a BAD BUY WASTED MONEY BUY"
3,Jorma Kaukonen: great guitarist and singer \ Jorma Kaukonen on this live performance: poor,"I put 3 stars because the songs are fine, but he messes up them: the picking is as usual not bad, althought not perfect, but the voice is not very good, and the auduence makes just horrible noises screaming like jerks.If you want a good Jorma recording, don't choise this one."
4,Mythology,I loved this book. A small but powerful lesson for children to listen and pay attention to their intuitive voice. Trust. It is also a great read :) Maori and Pakeha New Zealand come together in ways very rarely seen. A master Children's writer.
1,Adventure and Suspense,"This book is about three kids who get stranded on an island because there plane crashed. They survived on stuff from the island. This book talks about how they will survive when they are stranded for a week.I think the plot of the story was very good but needed to show more about how they survived. I would suggest this book to people who like lots of adventure and suspense.Reviewed by a student reviewer for Flamingnet Book Reviews, www.flamingnet.com."
4,this one has LIVE TRACKS!!!!,"a definite must-have for turks heads such as myself. the live versions of so long silver lining, hammerless nail, and tail crush are VICIOUS!!! other highlights include covers of ""Jiving Sister Fanny"" and Jim Swope and the Left's ""F**k It""(AWESOME), as well as unreleased original songs ""don't kimosabe me"" and ""stick it out""."
2,"An autobiography, not a technical book",The author has been around. He was at Bell Labs when it was great and held technical leadership positions in cellular industry.Unfortunately the book is more about the author's career and personal opinions than technical details as the title infers.Some of the history is interesting but not worth (the price.)
2,Brain dump about mobile phones (by a very smart guy),"This book is a loosely-organized brain dump by a very experienced, smart guy. It focuses on mobile phones, but is NOT a primer on wireless communications.It's not going to be accessible to a wide audience, even though he gives a few preliminary basics. You're expected to know what a dBmw is; you're expected to know what ""E V Field"" means; you're expected to just believe him when he says that an antenna must be at least 1/2 of the wavelength.As the other reviews mention, this book is largely biographical, and the facsimile reproductions of patents and business correspondence give it a scrapbook feel. I'd probably get more out of it if I already knew the essentials of mobile telephony.I got it for $3. That seems about right."
3,Entertaining,"This movie was entertaining, but had some adult scenes. The plot was fun and had many twists, but it has some inconsistencies at times."
2,Suspending disbelief and then whalloping it over the head several times...,"Charlie Bartlett's (Anton Yelchin) just your typical rich kid who can't stay in a prep school. This last one's kicked him out for making fake IDs.There's no prep school that will take him now. Charlie's stuck going to public school. We're talking riding the bus, the whole works.Only this time, he's gotten smarter with his illegal activities. Since he's got a psychiatrist on call, he's going to sell his prescriptions to the student body. His motivation--to be liked and needed--and it works.Only, it doesn't work for this audience member. Charlie's an engaging type, but the whole scenario is beyond suspending disbelief and into abandoning reality altogether. There are some good moments, like when the Kip Cromwell, the depressed kid everyone ignores, gets his play produced. Other than that, ""Charlie Bartlett"" the film's best moments are in the trailers advertising the film."
5,A very underrated movie,"I saw this for the first time when I was staying at my sister's house. I wasn't sure if I would like it or not but it completely took me by surprise. It was hilarious. Anton Yelchin is thoroughly lovable and exceedingly talented. I was immersed in the world of this teenage renegade and never wanted to leave. If you like light hearted fun, slightly off beat and crazy shenanigans with a deep message lying under the surface than this movie is for you."
3,"A little generic, but enjoyable","Pretty good, but I'm not quite as thrilled with is as some reviewers. Some witty dialogue, and the teens felt like real teenagers in high school, but some of the plot stuff seemed pretty generic. Still, in lesser hands this could have been awful, with the kids coming off and whiners and spoiled brats. Instead they seemed like individuals with real problems (at least with problems that seem real to them). I just could have lived without some of the cliched student-vs-authority plotlines. (Although Robert Downey Jr. does a nice job as a self-loathing principal)."
4,Surprisingly Good,I don't think I can add much to the reviews already submitted. I just want to weigh in with my rating. This is a really good movie.
5,"Craftsman Four drawer Side End Table, 4 DRAWER, DARK OAK","I bought and assembled two of these tables. I use them as end tables and they're perfect for that purpose. These items are very well designed, easy to assemble and use quality materials."
3,pond filter,This filter seems to do its job. I wished the carbon pad would last longer but it does a reasonable job.
1,Poor quality,"After about 1-2 wks the material has compressed and the filter has to be cleaned every 3-4 dys. It was not like that in the past, manufacturere may have gone to below par material. The filter is not cheap an better quality is to be expected."
5,Great and I don't have to go out to buy them.,I love being able to buy these and have them shipped to my house. Work great with our outdoor pond. Thanks Amazon.
1,No solution for this swimmer,"I was hopeful for this to help cleanse the chlorine off my sensitive skin. I did not want to give up swimming as part of my fitness plan. I use this in my first wash, and then have to use regular soap to get the chlorine smell off. It did not seem to help my skin irritations or wash away all the chlorine."
2,Chlorine smell still remains,"I bought this product in the hopes that it would remove the darn chlorine odor. I used the product as soon as I got out of the pool. I washed with it several times during that one shower, and when I finished, I still had that awful chlorine odor. I'm very disappointed with this product."
4,Very Proper...,"When you watch the DVD""s,you have to adjust to the Time-frame from wich these pictures are. Very Prim and Proper....But enyoyable to watch nevertheless."
2,Stop revisionist history - give your viewers some credit for brains,"Well once again the Disney people are more worried about correctness than presenting history in film in its original form. You may call it polite, I call it cowardice and censorship. The few do not need to decide for the many how to judge the past - this elitist attitude on the part of publishers and editors needs to be put to a dismal end. C'mon Disney, get a grip, have some gonads and present history in film as it is/was - uncut, unedited, uncensored and take the REST of your stuff off the dusty shelves and get them out for all to see - this is how the world was presented ""back in the day"" - and viewers can judge for themselves what is acceptable and what is not. We do not need for you to be tyrannical editorial kings (and cowards) over us."
4,Walt's Return,"Really good stuff, excellent transfers, but unfortunately some of the content is repeated off the ""Treasures"" Disneyland CD. C'mon Disney...you didn't think we were going to buy them both? A pleasure to visit Uncle Walt again."
4,"Entertaining, Complete (maybe a little too complete)","This DVD is everything I expected and more. A must-have for any lover of things Walt Disney or Disney nostalga. Leonard Malton reprises his role as excited narrator. Lots of the video here is recovered and good quality. Some, they did what they could, but its grainy. Many of the Disneyland TV shows include the animated 'shorts' in their intirety, making you wish they would end and walt would come back on the screen.Overall, an excellent product you will cherish for ages."
3,Neat that you see so much of Walt,"I it interesting to see the more-or-less ""real"" Walt Disney, compared to the books I have read that portrays Disney as either hero or villain. I really liked seeing ""Peter and the Wolf"" as it has been hard for me to find it. I almost fell out of my chair laughing at the dancing birthday cake -- it was ridiculous! I got this one because I had a gift card to use and this was all they had that was even close to what I wanted from the Treasures."
2,Disney Television,"This is a Televsion broadcast DVD. The 90 minute special from 1959 has some interesting things although the Kodak commercials get annoying. It is also very slow and somewhat boring especially during parade coverage and such. Some of the stuff on this disk is found on other Disney Treasures releases. It you have to collect them all then by all means buy it, but if you just want the best then buy Secrets, Stories and Magic. I still like this one, but I was just let down that it was not as good as the other Treasures releases."
1,Worked well when it was all in one piece.,"We had this phone since Nov. 2006. The phone broke in 2 this week, the top portion broke from the bottom portion. So no problem, since there is a 1 year warranty on the phone right? Wrong!!! Samsung says the phone can't be repaired, and the warranty is only for repairing the phone, not replacing it. They said we will have to BUY a new phone. So beware when buying Samsung products."
4,Dis phone is sooooo cool !!!,"I jus got dis phone today from cingular. I replaced it with mii RAZR, which i gave to mii mom. The screen is awesome and is sooo bright compared to the RAZR. The features r great and r fun to use. I recomend dis phone to teenagers. It is a beautiful phone and is affordable. I LOVE DIS PHONE !!!!!!"
3,Disappointing,"Basically, this is a reworking of the author's previous mystery, Walking on Water. Placed ten years later, with the same characters still struggling with the same murder and its outcome, and struggling, and struggling. It could have been half the length and twice as interesting. The premise is good, the outcome not."
1,Normal headphone - No surround sound effect,"This product works just like a normal headphone. With the dolby digital encoder,DTS etc... you cant get real home theater or 5.1 effect. Quality and sound is lesser than other 5.1 headphone available in market. Its better you can try to buy some 5.1 headphone which has 3 or 4 speakers in each ear cup."
4,"nice, but don't like the wrap -up","This is nice to take somewhere, but I get annoyed by the strap to close it with, since while changing, it is either under the baby being bumpy or the strap is getting caught up in the diaper while you change. I am not sure how this could be made better, because when you travel, it is nice to roll it up. So, it's just my opinion."
5,Mommy's Touch Changing Pad,Excellent for a shower gift. Doesn't take up a lot of room in diaper bag.
5,Great beat-you can dance to it!,"Really liked this CD- it is danceable and has clever lyrics. If you grew up in the 60's and remember garage bands- this is reminiscent of that time, except that this band is really good!"
3,"Too bad, this could be good for my grandchildren",I bought two of these for my 7 year old granddaughters (cousins) so they could keep in touch. I also thought they would be good educational toys.The problem is that you cannot stay logged in and wait for the other to get logged in. Every time one cousin has tried the other is not there. They have given up trying to reach each other now.
4,Looking for chat buddies,"When I bought this product for my seven year old daughter, I expected that I would be able to go to a website and chat for there. But the CD software must be installed on the computer in order to chat with her when she uses the device. I can't install software on my office computer! So I sit at the computer at home and she is in another room while we ""chat"". Looking for another girl her age to be a new ""chat"" friend. Kind of like a modern day ""pen pal""!"
1,It's a waste of money!,"I have to agree with the other reviewers. VERY DISAPPOINTING product. For $60 plus, I expected more. In no advertising does it mention the fact that all participants must have their own im-me. Love the premise of safe im-ing, but I get that now because she can only talk to people who's name I add. Was getting this to free up computer for other people in household. DO NOT BUY unless you know all of your daughter's friends and your family members are also buying an IM ME"
1,Misleading,"My 11 year old daughter had this as her No. 1 on her Christmas list, which of course I had to buy her. However, when we tried to use the product, I found out that it does not work with AIM. Needless to say, we are very disappointed in this product. I wish that the description and the ad video informed the public that this product will not work unless ""all your friends and family"" has the ""IM Me"". :(The website for the product is ""girltech.com"", which is useless in offering detail information on this product. It does not answer the question 'how to use' the product, nor does it say that it is ""not compatible with AIM"", nor does it say that ""all users need to own an IM Me in order to chat.""I would NOT recommend anyone buying this product unless you want to buy it for your child and all of their friends."
2,Ended up Returning this Item,The antenna device that you have to plug to your hard drive HAS to be facing UP or it will not work. There's only one way to plug it in and it was facing DOWN for us. Never could get it to work - had to return it. The toy company gave me a voucher for the value of it but now I can only buy either a Mattel or Fisher Price Item to replace it and it can't be done online. I feel like I got the shaft!!
1,just about useless,my granddaughters were convinced this was something entirely different. they checked out online videos and read up on it. its just about useless. should have checked into it mydelf. utter waste of money. BUYERS BEWARE THIS PRODUCT IS COMPLETELY MISLABELED AND MISREPRESENTED.
1,Product Does Not Work!,"If you want to punish your child, or if you enjoy seeing your child cry, then this is a great product for you. However, if you love your child and want to see them enjoy a gift, this is not for you. Watching my child cry on Christmas morning because this item does not work was one of the low points of my life. I will work tirelessly to let every child, parent, school, non-profit organization, review site, etc. know just how terrible of a product this is. I'll end up spending whatever amount it takes to purchase another toy for my child, hoping that it will help her forget how disappointed she was on Christmas morning when this product didn't work."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I purchased two of these toys for my daughter and her best friend as Christmas gifts. They were both so very excited. We installed the software and set up her account but are not able to add friends. When we tried to add friends on her account we get a ""server unavailable please try again later"" message. After several days of the same message I gave up and called the 1800 number. The rep at Mattel I spoke with had never even heard of this toy. She went on to tell me that it was discontinued and they were no longer offering service for it. I explained that I had just purchased the toy and she was shocked to hear that they were still being offered for sale. Mattel is sending me a voucher for something else but the company rep I spoke to said the IM-ME toy is useless and I should just throw it away. What a waste. Please save your money and don't buy this toy."
1,SIMPLE THEFT,The sale of this item is nothing short of theft. It is a piece of plastic that beeps but that will never enable messaging as advertised. We received this gift from a grandparent who could not have imagined that it would never work! In fact the website handling the communications has been closed for over two years. That information was provided in small print on the packaging but could not be seen online. I called Mattel and discovered that when the model was discontinued it was selling for around $8. Now two years later on Amazon...
1,fraud,"This item has been discontinued, and no longer is able to be used. Do no buy this product!!!! We called tech support, and they could not believe that they where still being sold... This is ridiculous."
4,Very Cute!!!,"The only reason I was buying this book was because I'm a HUGE Phantom Phan;I used to read the series when I was a kid and thought I'd give it a try. So after I read it, I thought it was cute read for kids (duh)."
4,Great flick,Arrived in good condition in a timely fashion. These films are great fun--good plot twists and lots of action. My only regret is that they are not cose-captioned. Thank you.
4,The perfect Tarot for the intermediate (Norse) user.,"The Book is strong in linking the major arcana to the stories of the Noremen, but does a disservice to the reader not familiar with Norse Mythology. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is already familiar with one or two versions of the standard tarot deck AND already has some familiarity with Norse mythology. The instruction is insightful, well articulated and comprehensive (I only wish it had been longer with an expanded section for runes... but you can't have it all). The cards are well drawn and detailed. Best of all, one does not have to memorize the meanings of the cards; the meaning is easily deducible from the pictures. Right on and about time!"
3,"Ok, but nothing special.","This was the first tarot pack that I receieved as a present from a friend. The artwork is not as good when viewed close-up as it is from further away. The drawings for the Major Arcana are better than those for the Minor Arcana, but neither groups have been (in my opinion) meticulously drawn. The accompanying book is quite good. There is some background to the Norse myths, gods and goddesses, but the explanations given for a reading of each card is very undetailed, basically just one like and not very helpful. You would need to buy another book on tarot if you were a beginner in order to give a concise and detailed reading. The book also gives an overview of the different spreads used which is quite well done, although once again, not as detailed as I would have liked. Overall, an average tarot pack."
5,Very interesting,"I ordered this deck and book for a friend in my Tarot class. We had been looking for this out of print deck for quite some time. When we first looked online it was terribly expensive if found at all.It was available in England but the shipping made it impossible. We kept looking every few months, and lo and behold, it appeared on Amazon for a reasonable price. She loves the deck. We were so glad we kept looking for this beautiful deck."
2,Weak Tuna,"This is a rather poor release, though it has its moments (the searing John's Other, for example). The sound quality is good and there is some histoy here, as it was recorded at the closing of the Fillmore West. Actually, that's the strongest selling point. Otherwise, the set list is almost the same as the ""First Pull Up..."" CD and it was recorded duirng the same year (1971) with the same line-up. All this leaves you wondering why it was released. One listen will cause the same reaction. Pass on it or save it until last."
3,Okay. Not the best ever.,"Hot Tuna has to be one of a handful of bands and musicians that can actually say that their music is...original. Not their music is not the greatest, but you can't say that they really sound like every other band. ""Uncle Sam Blues"", ""John's Other"", and ""Candyman"" are the best songs on the album. ""I know you Rider"" is the worst, but not that bad. If you want something original and not like any thing else pick up this cd. But I would recommend Hot Tuna's best album 'America's Choice'."
2,If you interpret it that way,"This documentary argues that Mike altered sculptures to signify his displeasure with the Catholic Church's leaders. Mike wanted worshippers to remain Catholic, but thought the Church should change with the times. Usually, I love when folk can interpret literature, art, or filmd deeply. I'm thinking about what the film ""The Door in the Floor"" says about its title. People liked ""The DaVinci Code"" for the same reason. However, I wasn't convinced that this was proof, only theory. The work never says that it's speculative. The work also tells the viewers little about Mike's biography. There is intrigue here. This did make for good historical and political drama. I just worry that it's just a house of cards."
1,terrible,"I purchased this dvd after enjoying ""the erotic witch project"". There is no comparison. This dvd contains no erotica and NO beautiful women. Please, find something else. Lolida 2000 would be a better choice."
3,Not 3390 joules - misleadingly advertised!,"There are several Belkin surge protection power strips that are being sold as the same product, be very careful as you shop online. Some have Ethernet, others Telephone. Some have cable organizer clips, others do not. BUT THEY ALL ARE MISLEADING YOU ABOUT THE SURGE PROTECTION! 3390 Joules would be the mark of a superior product. However these Belkin strips all are designed with 835 Joules protection between neutral-ground, 835 Joules between hot-ground, and 1720 Joules between hot-neutral. So it really is a 835 Joule surge protection power strip. That's mediocre at best. (835+835+1720=3390, but that is not the correct way to rate the protection being provided!)"
4,Good equipment,I'm very happy with the quality of this product! Mounts easily to wall and has plenty of room for even the largest charging plugs to sit next to each other.
5,AWESOME!!,"We bought 3 of these (two 8-outlet, one 12-outlet), and we LOVE them! There's an option to buy some with longer cords, which we took advantage of. They last well and look good in our living room and office."
2,flimsy safety covers,"The plastic safety covers tend to shift a lot if you plug and unplug devices. So if you move a laptop plug from room to room, plugging in the device, you may accidentally close the outlet. Otherwise it works ok so far."
3,Very austere,"I was looking for a basic, capable surge protector for my computer, TV, and printer. It works fine. The materials seem cheap and harsh. It is a little difficult to plug and unplug things. It is very functional, and looks that way. It is more or less what I was looking for. I am happy with it despite the minor annoyances."
4,all together,i needed a receptacle with several outlets and this one even had a surge protector on it. which gives you a little safety net in case there is a small spike comes through the line. it worked out well and the receptacles were placed so it was easy to accomodate the larger AC adapters. I'm very satisfied with the product. It always helps to order through AMAZON because you know you will get it as fast as possible with little or no cost for shipping
3,not the best quality,"Bought this to use at the beach last summer and it did serve its purpose, but I don't think it is going to last much longer. I pulled it out to use this spring and noticed it is tearing in a few places and it can not be fixed. It is cheap enough to buy for one season of use and the way it rolls up is a nice space saver when traveling."
5,love this mat!,"you can take this thing to the beach, the lake, out on a picnic..... anywhere you want to sit on the ground and not get dirty. super convenient because you can roll it up and throw it over your shoulder. it is a good large size. we haven't used it so much to the point of abuse..... we are careful with it so that it last longer because it is made of material that is needs a little more tlc. hopefully with proper care, it will last us a long time!"
3,marginal,"Even though i had a friend who swore by this product , I could never get it to work. Netgear support staff said my house was too big and since I had three circuit panels that might be the problem. Ended up going with a d-link router and range extender."
4,Where wireless won't reach,"I have a Mac Mini hooked up to my home entertainment center. The built-in wireless didn't work worth a hoot inside the metal frame where my entertainment gadgets are stored. The Netgear XE102 was the answer to my problems.When I first got a pair of them, they worked great for a couple minutes and then would quit working. When I began trying to configure the units, I realized that one of them would seize up. I exchanged it (which was pretty easy on Amazon), and have had zero problems since then.Assuming your units aren't defective, they are very easy to use. Just plug them in and and your good to go.I recommend these for places in your home where you need a network connection and don't want to run cable. I haven't tried it with my Xbox yet, but I believe it would work perfectly with one."
4,Saving a $300 Squeezebox purchase,"[[ASIN:B0002IHP58 NETGEAR XE102 Wall-Plugged Ethernet Bridge]Wireless to Squeezebox unsatisfactory due to heavy interference in NY apartment life. Everyone has a network, routers, etc.Squeezebox Tech suggested going Ethernet to insure connectivity. Went to Amazon to find Ethernet bridge with a wall-plugged unit. Given essential technology of wall-plugged units, felt used one would work just as well as new one. Plugged in two units, saved a lot of money and now have great sound from Squeezebox inputting constant stream of Internet music to receiver 35 feet and two rooms away from Netgear WPN824 router."
1,"What a joke, doesn't work at all","Netgear should be ashamed, this product does not work. Does not connect to my cable modem, does not connect to my router, does not connect to my network. Oh, and the 24/7 tech support they promise, what a joke, there is no one available to respond via the 'free' email tech support and if you want phone support, you have to pay for 'premium support services'These units are getting returned to Amazon first thing in the morning. Netgear looses another customer for life. Buyer beware!!"
2,Didn't work for me...,"The packaging and item arrived in the normal time and overall looked pretty good. When I tried hooking it up into my system, it would not work. I could get all the little lights to light up, but couldn't get on my network. I tried basically all the plugs in my house and still couldn't get on. I have a newer single family home (built in 2002) so I don't know if that's better or worse."
5,Amazing,"After struggling with various wireless options, fighting all of the networks in my area, and still only getting 6mbps per sec on a G network I tried this product. I was amazed at how well it works! I get a full 14mbps signal and I would never know it wasn't plugged into my router directly. I have a newer house so my wiring is perfect for this solution. I will be purchasing more to fill out my home network and recommending them to all my friends."
2,incompatibilities,"The system requirements ""For device connection: Available RJ-45 Ethernet Port"" suggest that the product works with any Ethernet device. This is NOT TRUE as I know now.I bought a pair of XE102 to connect a Samsung ML-2251NP network laser printer to our home network. While I could connect our two laptops through the XE102s and also the printer directly to the router without any problems, the printer could not get a connection through the XE102s. I called netgear support and a lady in India explained that the XE102 and the ML-2251NP are not compatible. When I asked her why this is not written in the tech specs, she hung up. This was my last netgear product.After this experience I bought a DWL-G820 to connect the printer wirelessly and it works perfectly like all our other D-Link products: a router, a wifi phone, and a cable modem."
3,"Not great, not bad","It works (which means it is perfect in the minds of many because so much networking equipment is very fickle) but thats not really enough to give it 5 stars. So I plugged it in, it worked, it is 1/3rd the speed of a wired connection and it only worked at some outlets depending on which subpanel, location, etc I was on. It in no way should be considered a replacement for a hard wired connection but it is a fairly good substitute. It is very easy, it works slowly in some places but it is not perfect so 3 stars. Little documentation, little/none telephone support. Now 1 year later I would give it fewer stars. It works somedays, not others, still very slow, makes copying files via network almost impossible. So sporadic internet access only."
1,So disappointed,"I already own the wireless version of this product that consists of a wired bridge and a wireless transmitter that works very well.I bought this to create an additional wired connection. What a mistake. I had the same experience that another reviewer had with Netgear tech support. I was told this would only work if all adapters were on the same electrical circuit. In order to give this the old college try I also contacted a local networking professional who came to the house to try and get this adapter linked up with the rest of my system.$100 later he came to the same conclusion as tech support, but he also reprogrammed my wireless router so that my signal is able to be picked up throughout the house. So technically speaking, I don't need the other Netgear stuff I own either.This is supposed to be plug and play. It's more like plug and curse.Returned this two weeks ago, still waiting for credit from Amazon."
1,Need 2,"you need 2 of them, one to plug in and connect to router and other to plug in whatever. waste of money in my opinion. dissapointed"
4,Serves it's purpose,"Most of the computers in my home are Linux. Since nearly all makes of wifi adapters do not provide drivers for Linux, I decided to try this product out as an alternative to wifi for a single connection between our router and my daughter's bedroom. (It is possible to wrap a windows driver for Linux, but the increased complexity and flakiness outweighs the benefit.) It worked the first time and installation was as simple as described (just plug the modules in and connect one via Ethernet cable to the router and the other via Ethernet cable to the wired device). It's transfer rate is lower than I am accustomed to but it suits my daughter's needs just fine. I would recommend this product for those who cannot use or choose not to use wifi and are satisfied with a midrange data transfer rate."
4,"Great Tech, but get the 104 instead",I bought this first and then returned it in order to get the 104 model with a bit rate of 84 or 85 Mbps and the benefit of 4 ethernet ports. I now have 3 of the 104's running and they set up easily and work flawlessly with my Mac network. A great product to move the internet access around the house with. You can also use them to run several WAP's in the house at different locations if your house is too big for just one. I give the 104 5 stars!
2,It doesn't work very well,"I'm able to establish connection using this device, but the speed is patchy, and worse, everytime i shutdown or suspend my laptop, I have to go to the originator plug and cycle the power, then go back to the other end of the house and do the same on the destination plug. i don't consider running back and forth across the house every time i'd like to use the internet acceptable performance."
2,Not wireless,"This works ok, but not as well as hoped for. But be warned -- the SEE IT NOW video link from THIS product shows truly wireless adapters. This is NOT one of those so I'm not sure why Netgear would show those in a video for a non wireless adapter. You plug this device into an outlet and then run an ethernet cable from the device to your PC/laptop."
5,These work great!,"I have been using these for over a year, and have never had a problem. I wish everything ""just worked"" like these do. Of course, their throughput is usually only around 5 Mbps, but this is more than enough for my (and most people's) needs right now."
4,Very entertaining,Great movie but Kristen Stewart cannot act. I would recommend that others see this movie if they get the chance
1,Don't waste your time!,"When the characters weren't busy whispering or mumbling (for dramatic effect I imagine, but failed miserably by just being annoying), they were simply showing poor acting skills (not what I would have expected from this ensemble). The movie dragged and left me wishing they would just get to the end already. A good premise that was poorly executed."
1,Sooooo boring! Never again!,"I was really looking forward to this film. I thought the fight scenes would be bad a$$. Boy was I wrong! I was checking the time, hoping it was almost over. Don't plan to EVER watch it again. Totally and completely flat movie! If you're planning to buy the dvd, you may be wasting your money. Or you might actually like it. Either way, I've done my public service and warned you!"
2,Don't Bother,"Visually exciting...and that's about it. Story line is awkward and thin. It does not lend itself to full, developed characters, which only makes the mostly flat acting even harder to sit through. Chris Hemsworth (the huntsman) was the only actor that I thought was worth watching, although I had expected to like Charlize Theron as the queen. Kristen Stewart is not remotely convincing, and certainly doesn't inspire. All in all a dud. I regret even paying the few dollars to rent it."
1,Please Give Me the Poison Apple,"I'd rather eat the apple than see even one minute of this silly, silly, silly movie again.This was recommended to me by another adult and I thought, ""Why not? Perhaps it's a clever adaptation of the fairy tale."" HAHAHAHAHA I will be honest and say I stopped the movie when Snow White was escaping from the tower.The beginning scene is lovely. The snow falling. The rose. The queen pricking her finger. That's the high point. How much stupid computer-generated animation, how much melting objects with deep voices, how many stupid battle scenes are the American public going to keep swallowing before they've had enough and stop going to see drivel like this?Give me the cartoon any day.PS Charlize has exceeded her limit of angry women roles. She's nice to look at but her range is glaringly apparent."
2,Not so much.,This movie was just weird. Not sure that I understood what was even going on. The graphics were almost cartoonesque.
3,Snow White & the Huntsman,"It's a manipulated fairy tale. If you are entertained by that sort of thing then it's O.K..Not my kind of flick, kids might enjoy it more."
5,Ok show adaptation,Not quite what I expected of the redo of the classic show. Nice special effects. Still poor acting from Kristen.
3,Kristen Stewart Still Can't Act,"The overall movie was alright. There were definite portions that seemed to drag, most due to Kristen Stewart's acting skills but some scenes just lacked focus. If you want a great movie this is not the one, but if you want to be mildly entertained then by all means, enjoy."
3,Enjoyed it!,But the ending left me wanting more. Expected more romance too. Otherwise a very enjoyable spin on the well-loved fairy tale. Empowers Snow White and rescinds the label of damsel in distress.
3,Snow White and the Huntsman review,"The film was watchable and held my interest because of the cinematography. Plot wise it was predictable but not well developed or at least some of the characters were just there throughout the movie and really were not tied in well to the script. Two bag of pop corn and a drink with this movie will be enjoyable, but not very memorable."
3,Previews are better than the movie,"I have wanted to see this movie since it came out. I was a bit disappointed. The story line was refreshing because it was different than any I have seen or read but it was missing substance, too many holes to fill. Overall it was watchable but not that good."
5,this movie rocks,"As a fan of farytails, this movie is a treasure. I wold buy this again and will watch it several times."
4,Loved It,I enjoyed watching this movie and would watch it again. I love the fairy tale themes and its great to see them brought to life again in these times with new technology in movie making.
2,I expected better,The trailers seemed good. I read positive reviews. I almost went to see it in the theater but in the end I waited to rent it. I'm glad I did because it was a big let down. The plot was weak at best and some of the special effects were bad. I would pass on this one.
5,Great Suprize,I wanted to see this movie but had read a a lot of bad reveiws. Well they were wrong while it's not going to win an academy award it is a very good movie
4,Nice Surprise!,I wanted to see this movie for the special effects and never expected to find it as interesting. Turns out to have great movie plot and lots of action and the special effects didn't dissapoint. I don't think Kristen Stewart was the best choice to pair with Charlize Theron. I feel Kristen is a very plain actress and the movie could have been even better if there was a different Snow White.
4,Good adaptation.,Good adaptation of a great story. The special effects are right on. The ending may be disappointing for some people.
4,SnowWhite and the Huntsman,"The consideration of a different view of the same story was very good. Sometimes the story moved a little more slow than what I prefer, I am sure it is good for a younger age group. However,I still enjoyed the new point of view."
1,Why oh why?,Why would such great actors think this is the movie to star in? Good acting I suppose but the movie itself is bull
2,plot lacking,poor plot pretty good special effects. Theron was pretty good stewart was pretty bad. Would probably skip this one and wait for it to come out on HBO or something
2,Poisoned Apple,"Brainless story and wooden acting from all except Charlize Theron. You all know the classic story's foundation. This movie asks us to believe that Kristen Stewart is the prettiest in the land?? I don't know about you, but I was routing for the huntsman to kill her even before he actually came on to the screen. The girl simply...cannot...act. The Twilight movies should have given that impression loud and clear, and although I had some hope b/c there actually are good actors (Theron/Bob Hoskins/Ian MacShane), this movie flat out stunk."
1,Boring,This movie was boring. She is a horrible actress. The movie drug on and I ended up not even finishing it. Blah.
4,Good twist to classic.,It was beautifully made. Acting was good. Leading actress wasn't as pretty as she should have been. Loved the witch.
4,what were the haters talking about?,"i kept on hearing ""oh kirsten stewart ruins this movie"" ""she didn't pull off the role by a long shot""what the hell were they talking about?!?!?!?!this movie was pretty damn good as a whole, and the climax at the end was one of the best i remember seeingwas it the best movie of 2012? no, not in my opinion.but regardless it was a good movie and not nearly as bad as some others made it out to sound"
3,"wanted to like the movie, but..","why so harsh on stewart, while watching movie only theron seemed noticeably off [over dramatic to the point of being funny]. the problem with the movie in general was probably the producer like in hunger games, which although better than this, it still was lacking and therefore disappointing.even so, great job by actor sam claflin [looking forward to seeing him in next hunger games, hopefully with another producer also] and inspiring music by james newton howard, ioanna gika, and florence + the machine."
1,Not good,The movie was okay but they didn't finish the story. It was just a big let down at the end.
2,"Good idea, but fell flat in execution","The idea of Snow White in a non-cutesy light was a good one. However, on screen it just didn't quite work. The casting was wrong: Snow White was supposed to be fairer than the Queen, but the actress they chose just looked like she was in pain the whole time. The character development left the viewer not really caring about any of them and the focus seemed to mainly be on battles and action."
5,Watch it!,"I had to run out and buy this. Not only is Kristen Steward awkwardly perfect for the role, buy Charlize Therone as the witch was mesmerizing. And Thor as the huntsman, who could ask for anything more. Beautiful settings and exciting story lines. I recommend watching it and then buying it!"
3,"Great special effects, but story sucks!","Great special effects, but story sucked! I watched and somewhat enjoyed it, the effects were well done. But if you are looking for that modernized version of a true classic story, or anything resembling a well written story, you will be sorely disappointed!"
3,ok..probably would not have purchased it if I had seen it.,"Acting was good however the story line lacked action and substance, if I had seen it, I would not have purchased it."
3,Snow White & the Huntsman,the film left alot for the viewer's imaginiation as I know the real story of the snow white saga. the plot was hard to grasp as the wicked step mother did not live up to the origional ....
3,Snow White not quite right,"Stewart was not the right pick for this role. Keira Knightly would have been a much better choice. The movie overall was a letdown, glad I just rented it."
3,snow white and the huntsman,jtwasnt as what i thoughtit would be . i didnt like it at all. i thought she was a better actress then that.
3,Snow White and The Huntsman,Nice version of this fairy tale. Very dark. Charlize was very good as the Queen. Liked it but glad I didn't spend the money to see it in the theater.
1,Terrible,Couldn't make it through the entire film. Charlize is gorgeous. Some of the cinematography was beautiful and enchanting. Charachters weren't built. Kirsten was horrendous and flat. Would NOT recommend.
2,Disappointing,"The special effects were very good but the directing was terrible. This young gal has been locked in the tower for years and as soon as she breaks out she runs like hell down the hall and through the village. She manages to escape through a drainage system then jumps off a cliff and swims to safety. And there, behold, just happens to be a white horse to save her. After years of captivity she somehow knows how to ride a horse bareback, at breakneck speed, without falling off.The Huntsman made the movie."
1,ONE OF WORST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN,"WRITTEN BY BRENDA MUMFORDTHIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN. DARK(IN STORY AND CINEMATOGRAPHY), BORING, NO LIKABLE CHARACTERS, THERON WAY OVER TOP, STEWART JUST PLAIN BORING, DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE ANY OF THE OTHER CHARACTERS. ONLY BRIGHT SPOTS WERE THE TROLL MONSTER AND THE LITTLE SHORTY GUYS(DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE CALLED). LOOKED SO GOOD IN PREVIEWS BUT AS WITH MOST MOVIES TODAY THE PREVIEWS ARE THE HIGHLIGHTS-JUST WATCH THEM AND FORGET THE MOVIE."
2,"This movie was in good condition, but just wasn't a good movie","I was a little disappointed, I had really wanted to see this remake of the original fairytale. It was not what I expected."
3,Good Quality,"The actress who played the queen made this film well worth the the rental fee. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't as exciting as I had anticipated."
3,Lots of potential that just didn't quite make it.,"Enjoyed the movie but I am glad I didn't pay full price to see it in a theater. The best parts were revealed in the trailers, the characters were not well developed and there was no real climax."
3,Good entertaining...,"Not the best film, but entertaining enough to get your attention. Recommended for a rainy day or when there's nothing better else to watch."
3,What a dopey movie,the costumes were astounding but there were great holes in the story and Kristen Stewart is a bore of an actress. She seems to only be able to summon surprise and a grimace.
4,Pretty good!,"Pretty good and suitable for family viewing. Some nice effects andnot predictable ending. I thought it was ok, and young girls love it."
3,It was ok.,It was ok. I can't say it was particularly noteworthy- I watched it not too long ago and can't remember what happened. It wasn't that bad either because if it was I would remember that it was particularly bad. So... It was ok.
3,not a bad movie,"Kristen Stewart could have at least tried to change her expression at least a couple of times during the movie. Charleze Theron was amazing as the witch, she made the movie watchable. Chris Hemsworth was good as the huntsman."
3,Snow White & The Huntsman,The acting was a bit staid. Ending was a flop where everyone stood like stones. The scene took so long and you wondered where this was going. Does she marry the Duke and live happily ever after?
1,Thought I was getting a DVD not a Blue Ray,"This showed up when I searched for DVDs. The package says DVD and Blue Ray, but all that I got was the Blue Ray. I do not have a Blue Ray player so it was just a waste of money and I will never do that again."
4,"Ending was weak, but overall good","Ending was weak, but overall good. Great special effects and good story. Ending could have been beefed up and made stronger."
3,Lacking Emotion,"This movie was well scripted and visually beautiful. I liked the darker story line too. I think that Charlize Theron did a great job as the evil queen and Chris Hemsworth did a great job as the strong and rugged huntsman. But Kristin Stewart can not act. That women had the same frozen poker face throughout the film. Whether she was suppose to be scared, happy, hurt or fighting, she just had this blank, frozen, straight face without any expression. She can't act at all and I think she ruined the movie. There is no way to relate to this woman's character of Snow White. If she were over 50, I would think that she got too many Botox injections. Her face does not move. Too bad they didn't use a different actress. This could have been a great film with the right actress."
2,Got a free ticket to see it and It still wasn't worth it,"I actually saw this in theaters when it was going around and had gotten a free ticket for it. The evil queen and the huntsman were great in their scenes and the movie could have been really great had the lead actress actually acted.I'm pretty sure Kristen Stewart can breath with her mouth closed and act at the same time if she tried a little harder, but I wouldn't want her to hurt herself. Stewart's idea of acting is apparently rapid blinking, breathing through her mouth, and looking wooden during her scenes.Unfortunately the movie suffered for it, which is a real shame because the rest of the film is visually stunning. Especially the parts with the evil queen."
2,Hemsworth and Theron Deserve Better,"Having had avoided the Twilight films like the plague after seeing the first to get what all the fuss was about, this was only my second time seeing Kristen Stewart at work. My opinion of her has not changed. This take on the Snow White story, mixed in with a liberal dose of fantasy battle, is profoundly flawed. Stewart is horribly cast in the lead, incapable of showing any more expression than her usual sullenness, and cannot act even if her life depended on it. The movie would have benefitted from a director who knew what he was doing, a better crafted story that wasn't trying to pander to the audience coming to see the leading lady, and a leading actress capable of emotional range. Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron, who are much better than the material deserves, should be in a better movie. If it weren't for these two actors, my opinion of the film would have been even lower."
4,Good Movie,This was a good movie. Definately worth seeing. I would recommend to an adult audience as it's a spin on the snow white fairy tale.
2,Cool special effects but the script needed lots of work,"If you're hoping for an interesting and somewhat faithful adaptation of the classic Grimm's fairy tale Snow White, don't look to this movie for it. This piece is good for special effects you may not have seen before, but not great at story telling. Even though some of the acting is quite good, (and some quite bad), the movie suffers from a terrible script. It was hard to watch all the way to the end because the writing was such drivel."
2,Had high hopes but,"I had really high hopes going in to see this movie, but I found myself (from the beginning) laughing out loud when I wasn't supposed to be."
1,"Boring and stupid, or is the proper order stupid and boring....","What a dumb movie! Charlize Theron is always lovely to see and watch. She's cool. The rest of the actors are just bad. And the story (can we really call it a story?) is just plain stupid. The movie drags on and on forever with no relief or sense. It's just an awful movie....I don't watch the Twilight movies, so this was my first time seeing Kristen Stewart on screen trying to act. What a joke! She's rich from one lucky casting for a BIG franchise, but we won't be seeing her on Oscar night. No acting skills that I can see... I hope RPatz is getting more from her than we are....""Snow White and the Huntsman"" makes you wonder just how much cocaine it takes in Hollywood to make anyone think it's worth making. My favorite line was when Kristen Stewart tells the director's wife who she cheated on: ""no harm done"". hahahaha....Thank goodness I didn't spend money at the theater to see this dud..."
3,Loved the evil queen,I liked it overall but didn't care for kristen Stewart's acting. I could be bias because she cheated on Edward!
3,snow white & the huntsman,"too much special effects - too dark - story line meandered around the real story - nice acting, though. mediocre"
2,"great story, bad filming",this was such a waste of a terrific movie! I was unable to really watch it and keep focus on it because the charachters would either be so loud that I would have to turnthe volume down on my TV or it would suddenly be so quiet that I found myself tuning the volume up nearly full capacity. This was not once or twice. This was constant! And very annoying! A waste of my money and a waste of what really looked to be a good film because I won't attempt to play it again! Somebody messed up bad here!
1,I could identify with Sleepy,"This movie was downright awful. My wife and I went to see this in the theatre and it was a disaster. I cant really figure out how people think this was a good movie. If your definition of ""good"" is some way of keeping you out of the heat of summer for two hours a success, then eureka... winner. The whole thing was a bloody mess. Melodramatic at its best, simply insipid the rest. I have seen Kristin Stewart in decent roles in her early career, but she is basically playing her bella character guised in the mythos of snow white. yeah she looks good, but that is about it. It all felt weak. I felt there could have been a better movie there, but it just stayed flat without much real inspection of the huntsman part, the only way to make this work and not turn it into a live action anti-disney film. If you want to watch charlize expose her back and see the cool television trailer in ""context"" spend your money, otherwise watch the trailer and move on."
2,Disappointed,Once again Hollywood insults the viewing public by trying to win them over with special affects alone. Everything from the directing the writing and the acting was sub-par at best. I had hoped for more but was left wanting.
2,Really????,Ok so the movie itself was good and everyone in this movie was good except for Kristan Stewart for some reason I don't know if its just me but she only has one facial expression and its the one that looks like she's always in excruciating pain she is a horrible actress and anyone who hires here is stupid she only has one facial expression really come on!!!!
3,Snow White & The Huntsman,"The movie was OK. I thought Kristan Stewart was dull and unexciting. She didn't bring her character to life. The other actors, Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron were great and made up for what she lacked."
2,Another boring Kristen Stewart Movie,Another boring Kristen Stewart Movie. The Queen was more interesting--and a lot better looking than Kristen Stewart. KS playing another poor helpless sap. Movie needed more special effects and interesting characters. If they couldn't do that than it at least should have had more violence.Skip it--nothing to see here.
2,"Visually appealing, but shallow and predictable.","Charlize Theron deserves praise for making a believable evil queen, but she could not save this film from the poor story line and pacing. It's mildly entertaining, but wait until it goes on sale for $1.99 rental."
2,Poorly developed characters,I was disappointed in the character development in this movie. The characters were flat. The actors didn't have an opportunity to explore their characters as it felt that they were just trying to cram too much into the story. Not my favorite.
2,Not bad for a rock video...,"By midway through the movie, I was rooting for the witch. Given the choice, Charlize Theron was a much more attractive option than the wooden, emotionless ""Snow White"" who couldn't persuade me to like her in the least. Visually, it was an incredible movie. Unfortunately, Kristen Stewart was frequently out-acted by the scenery and made the experience simply brutal. Too many long shots of her emotionless face could have trimmed the movie to about 45 minutes."
3,Ok movies,Ok movie youfor a Friday night popcorn and a movie night. This is one you will have to decide for yourself.
3,Charlize Theron was great,"Entertaining movie. Would watch it again. Wished the dwarfs were a bit more upbeat, the movie itself was pretty dark. Charlize Theron was great! Good special effects."
2,Poor Storytelling,The visuals in this film were stunning. The storyline was bland. Things did not make sense. I think it could have been good if they had given more background to the Queen's story. Actually not enough background/fleshed out characters throughout.
2,Disappointed,"I had been looking forward to seeing this movie which is why I was so disappointed when I finally did. The story line didn't flow as it jumped around and if you didn't know the fairy tale story you were probably lost as to what was going on. The only good acting I saw was the wicked Queen, she was really on the mark which is why I am giving it two stars, for the Queen. I have no words to describe the ending of the movie it was that bad. So glad I viewed it beforehand, since I had thought about ordering it, which I didn't."
3,Snow White not so white,This a dark turn even from original Snow White plots. Which I'm ok with but it was more graphic than I thought. Definitely for the more mature of 13 or older. I won't spoil anything else about this movie. Good actors. Dwarfs aren't really dwarf actors. Give the parts to the ones who fit the part
3,not great,"Pretty weak performance from Kristen Stewart - seems like she was just playing Bella in another movie. The special effects weren't bad, overall if it were a free movie, it is worth watching, but I would spend my money on it again."
2,I don't remember asking for Linear,"Snow White & The HuntsmanIs it my imagination or are we now entering into a phase where all movie genres are reduced to a ""Police Procedural"" format? Linear, step by step reenactments of each other? Because at some point I was under the impression that ""plot points"" were united with character development in such a way that we, humble supplicants all -- actually enjoyed or cared about the characters or felt a connection to the back story or (on seemingly rare occasions) both. This was a tragic waste of talent and while you could point to the subject matter and say, as a viewer I'm demanding too much complexity -- and all I'd be able to say is, ""Yeah, but other people seem to be able to do it successfully. Better luck next time."
3,"""Bella"" playing Snow White, but loved the special effects","I loved the special effects. Kristen Stewart does a pretty good job, but since I had seen all of the Twilight movies up to the last one, I thought she had no different kinds of expressions than in the Twilight movies so seemed kind of like Bella playing Snow White. I love to see special effects and is the main reason I rented the movie. I thought it might have been a little more in the romance. I loved the Sanctuary ""fairy forest"" and again for the special effects. It was pretty amazing. Overall, I'll probably watch it again before the Jan.2013 deadline. Even though I rented it for 48 hours, it says I can watch it until Jan.6 I think it said. Not really for young children though, I'd choose the Disney version for children under 10 or so."
2,No more please!,"I was so excited for Snow White & The Huntsman to come out; not because of Stewart and her Twilight involvement, but for the simple fact that the trailer looked amazing. I should have stuck with the trailer. The costumes and cinetography are as beautiful as the trailer would have you believe but the acting and script are subpar. I would watch it again but only with the mute button on and if we can skip Stewart's classic and always there ""oh no. What should I do?"" face. Even when she rides to battle and is supposed to be a strong heroine, she has her ""I'm conflicted"" face on. I think I may hate her as the heroine even more than the script. By the end of the movie, I was bored and secretly wanted the Snow White to die again just to spice up the movie."
3,The darkside of Snow White,"I rented this movie. I thought the production quality was very good. However, storyline was a bit too dark for my taste. Not a movie I would purchase and view repeatedly."
3,Not the fairy tale,"This has great acting --(with Charlize Theron you'd expect nothing else), but the movie is a bit violent -- not for children."
3,Should have been so much better,"The cinematography was good, but the storyline needs more development at the beginning. I disagree with the selection of Theron and even more so in the case of Stewart. Neither one was very convincing. The end of the movie with Stewart's coronation was anti-climatic and her speech to rally the troops was weakly delivered."
3,Confusing,"On the one hand, Charlize was incredible and played the perfect Queen. On the other, Kristen Stewart played her typical plain jane self. She doesnt know how to act and you cant tell this character apart from her Bella character except a slight accent change that was not believable. It was entertaining but could have been better with a change of Snow Whites character to another actor."
3,like it,"seriously, how can people think kristen stewart is this amazing actress, shes so one dimensional in every role she plays?"
3,ITs ok,Guess im to old for a new story.. sorry... but other then that i guess it was ok...:) good graphics
3,Flash,"A lot of flash,but somehow fell short of expectation,especially with Theron in it. It was fun to watch but not a great movie."
3,It was ok,This movie was alright but nothing great. Kinda predictable and not too realistic. But worth watching once i suppose. :)
3,It was okay,I have nothing to say. It was something to watch on a night when there was nothng else to watch.
3,No dialog,"The evil queen was the best thing going on in this whole move! There just was little to no dialog and poor acting, the actual story idea was great. Wouldn't see it again"
3,Good Movie Stream locked up,Movie was entertaining but the damn stream locked up and I had to reboot my whole system because of it
4,Time Killer,Good movie for passing the time on a cloudy day. My mom really enjoyed it more than me. Probably better if I had kids.
3,Good special effects,"Weak, contrived story line based on the fairy tale, but barely recognizable. Unimpressive acting, the ending is weak and anti-climatic, some of the dialog is impossible to understand, and Kristen Stewart is her usual expressionless self. Some of the special effects are impressive, but not enough to recommend the movie."
3,Snow White & the Huntsman,"Dark, sometimes too long on the fight scenes, some pretty good graphics. Little people probably the best part with the best lines."
3,Lots of special effects no substance,"This movie was only okay. It was entertaining enough while it was, on but a day after my husband and I watched it we could barely remember the plot. Two weeks after we watched it my husband forgot that we had already seen it(which says a lot about the movie) That being said, if you are looking for a diversion you will be entertained but it definitely isn't a film that you will be excited to talk about once it's over."
3,It was okay but not great,"Most of the movie and actors were great but Kristen Stewart was a big disapointment. She seems to play the same part, use the same expressions in every part she plays. Its hard to tell one part shes played from another. Everyone else was spot on.I really expected more from this movie."
3,Good thing I only paid $3.99 for the rental,"I have to say that I have paid money to watch all 4 of the Twilight movies... that being said, I think Kristen Stewart is an annoyingly poor actress, making this movie a HUGE disappointment. I love Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth. But even so, I felt there wasn't enough character and plot development. I didn't feel like I got to know the characters enough to understand the ""why""'s. So, that made all the cool fight scenes disconnected from the story that I felt the director was trying to stress more on the graphics and ""creepy"" feel from the witch and the fighters. I was bored halfway through the movie, sad to say."
4,I like,Go ahead and Just watch it. It is a good spin on the Snow White story. It does not disappoint.
1,Snow White,I really thought this would be an entertaining movie but instead I found it very dark and depressing. After attempting to watch it twice I finally gave up and never finished it.
3,Interesting adaptation,"This film deviates greatly from the original but is still well done with interesting choices with the cinematography, but I did like it and Charlize Theron is brilliant in her adaptation on her part"
4,Nice remake of a classic tail,More action and suspense than a typical fairy tale. Good cast and good production quality. What can I say....I enjoyed watching it.
2,Poor streaming.,"I liked the movie, but I had to wait until the next day to watch it because it kept freezing and starting. I thought it was my connection, but I was able to watch Netflix with no problems after logging off Amazon. I will not use this service again."
3,Snow Tainted,"The movie was a wee bit on the disappointing side - especially with all the media coverage concerning Kristen Stewart's adulterous affair, with the Director, a married man. Last time I checked the 10 Commandments and the New Testament were still ""against"" adultry. My suggestion, for Rupert would be stick to the things that will improve the career choice he made (to be a Director) and give up on chasing women because he thinks the grass might be greener on the other side or that he is seen as a ""catch"". Please! What mirror has been talking to Rupert? I've been on the other side, of the grass, - it is not greener, never is and ends up hurting more people due to our own personal selfish desires. My prayers are with him, his wife and child/children that they can heal, forgive and move on. Kristen will not remain popular if she hurts Rob again!! BTW Kristen, you didn't pull the British accent off like Rupert told you - men will say anything to get what they want. Lesson #1."
4,Awsome,Just like how mum told it. A fantastic movie with the making of snow white meets Thor. A dark tale that is a true gem.
3,Better Than Average,"I had low expectations for the movie so it actually pleased me. The special effects I thought were pretty decent and the story is interesting. The things that hindered the movie to me were how the story didn't flow well at certain points. Big jumps from a caged Snow White for years and years to where she is free and handled the change with no problem. I mean if I was in a tower for all those years as a kid, I think I would be a bit messed up. Also.. the Huntsman reminded me too much of Thor. Not much acting range in those two roles."
3,Great Effects/So-So Film,"The special effects were dazzling and Charlize Theron did a fine job as the queen, but I just couldn't feel much of anything for any of the characters in the film."
3,It's Okay...,Sort of boring movie...couldn't really get into it. I like the Evil Queen and then lost it...the first was beautiful.
4,Great Movie.,This was a really good movie. It surpassed the fairy tale of old. I enjoyed it. The evil queen was a great experience.
2,snow white and the huntsman,movie dragged on.scenery was beautiful but that only goes so far. Kids enjoyed it so that's what is important.I did'nt really care for it.
2,A little disconnected,"The actress/actors did well in acting but the story was boring for some reason - maybe the transitions between acenes were not smooth , or the climax was predictable .... I thought this movie would better than Judge Dredd- surprisingly, Judge Dredd was better in plot and direction.Bottom line - snowhite was not quite 'put together' to make an impact."
2,I usually like this kinda thing....,"Visually it was a beautiful movie, the acting was good (except for Ms. Theron's over the top shouting moments, I'm actually a big fan of hers),I'm usually also a fan of James Newton Howard's scores but this just felt unfinished or rushed, the writing or screen play was the real problem for me, the characters were just not fleshed out properly and the story just never really felt like it was building towards anything, and I just really couldn't bring myself to care one way or the other about the characters. It's surprising for a film whose moral message is supposed to be about inner beauty, I found it to be rather....shallow."
2,Just skip it.,"First of all, when I saw the trailer in which the always terrible Kristen Stewart is more fair than Charlize Theron, I decided not to even watch the movie. I later caved in and unfortunately watched it. If someone had cut out panoramic pictures and screen sets from the movie, it would have been significantly shorter. Also, there were no emotional connections to any characters other than the evil queen and at times the huntsman.Overall, a very boring and anticlimactic version of this classic tale. Literally NOTHING exciting happens."
2,"Decent. Rent it, do not buy it.","Simply put, the movie is decent, Kristen Stewart is just as annoying and emotionless as ever, and the films dialog sound level is so poor you have to crank the volume to hear it just to turn it down not to be over powered by action scenes. Rent it, do not buy it."
3,kristen stuart....really?,"this wouldve been a 5 star movie if it wasnt for kristen stewart. She did such an injustice to the character , it was disheartening. She has the emotional range of a foot stool and is less interesting to watch. Its a shame because everything else was great."
5,Snow White and the Huntsman,Got this for grandchildren. My son and his family didn't like it; said it was boring. I haven't seen it yet.
4,Good,It wouldn't make my list of top 10 favorite movies but with the digital copy it was worth the purchase.
2,Uncomfortable,The movie made me uncomfortable for the actors. I was embarrassed for them. Hemsworth and Stewart were just annoying and Charlize Theron forced an uncomfortable accent and uncomfortable dramatics. Where was Sean Bean? (Saw him in the credits - but didn't see him in the movie or what did I miss?) I would not call it the worst movie I've ever seen - but it could have been so much. Too much of a bad LOTR rip-off.
3,Is pretty enough?,"This movie is visually very attractive. There is some of the best depictions of fae I've seen in a long time and the forest is beautiful. Chris Hemsworth does a great job considering how thinly written his character is. Charlize Theron is fantastic at depicting the witch as irredeemably evil and extremely broken. Kristen Stewart is, well, pretty. Too bad she portrays the main character."
1,Could be good,"Could be a good movie without Kristen. She must have slept her way to get the role. It was just a wrong cast. No way in the right mindset would anyone cast her for the role. She cannot act, she does not look innocent, and she is not pure, not pretty like what the storyline describe her. I will never watch a move with her in it again! Charlize is really good in the movie."
4,Very Nice,"I watch this movie and found it very exciting, the effects of the movie was great!if you like this type of movie i would recommend it."
4,Pretty good,I gave this movie 4 stars cause it was much better than what I thought it would be. Kristen Stewart is sexy.
2,Okay,I was expecting it be more along the story but as usual the movie industry glamorized it with their own twist on the original. No worth buying. Charlize was awesome I it she made the movie as others have said.
2,Really?,Yuck. Kristen Stewart prettier than Charlize??? Please! Not even a good story. Don't waste your time or money. Disney is better than this.
3,Predictable but Nice Cinematography...,"From the minute the movie starts, you know what's going to happen. Not because you know this story from your childhood but because it's not a well thought-out screenplay. The cinematography is actually pretty nice and makes you feel that you're watching a high-budget movie. The acting is slightly better than average but no great performances, except by Charlize Theron who provides a very interesting and deep portrayal of the ""wicked witch/evil stepmom."" The plot stays on track but has little depth, little explanation, and ho-hum characters that simply act the part they are told and don't really bring them to life. Generally, an okay movie if you're bored and nothing else is on!"
4,Snow White & the Huntsman was great!!,"First movie I've had streamed via Amazon. Excellent color and clarity. Great graphics. I had doubts about the movie itself--wasn't sure if the audience was for ""kiddies,"" teens or adults. This movie held my interest throughout. Would definitely recommend to anyone."
2,Snow White,Not as exciting as I thought it would be. Good specials effects. Bad acting by the actors that played Snow White and the huntsman
2,Loprd of Rings Wanna Be,"Snow White meets Foto. Not well directed or edited. Concept is fine to twist the Snow White story a tad. Over dramatic thought. The whole movie felt like I was watching a college project to duplicate the Lord Of Rings movie feel as a class project or something. As a class project certainly it deserves an ""A"". As a production movie it is more of a ""C"".Bummer... it really could have been very good. Anyway... go ahead and watch it.. make sure you watch Lord of Rings first... then comment on my post."
5,Snow White and the Huntsman,Good movie it took me a bit to get this movie but i finaly did and it was very entertaning!!!!
5,Snow White and the Huntsman,"Loved this movie. Graphics are great. Will be watching it again and again. Charleze was fantastic in this, she needs to play evil more often."
1,Boring and slow,"Visually very good; great special effects. That's it. Not the fault of the actors either. It moved very slowly, was boring, characters were boring and it felt as though it dragged on and on."
3,Entertaining,"Beautiful to watch, but a little boring. I was entertained, but didn't go 'wow that was good' at the end."
2,tired,"I missed this in the theatre, still enthralled by the spectacle of Avengers and am glad that I did. Kristen Stewart is just so wooden. She acts like she doesn't care about anything, which might've worked for Bella. Chris Hemsworth was all right, playing the strong brute. But the story was justkinda blah for me. If you want a modern retelling of fairy tales, watch Once upon a time. Much more inventive."
2,If you need sleep watch it will put you out!!!!,I thought it dragged. They shouldve had a better actress playing Snow White. Cherolize was an awesome wutch. She carried the movie!!! Will not watch again.
4,This was a good one!,"This is a good, entertaining adaptation of the children's story. It's all grown up now with action and suspense. It borrows some references to the original fairy tale, but is its own story on its own too. Nice job. Not for the little kiddies (especially when one of the dwarves is killed!), but adults will like it."
2,CGI Dwarves...really?,"I must say that besides the fact that most of this cast was simply miscast (Charlize overacting could have been anyone), and as the storyline became more and more absurd, it was the fact that the dwarves were CGI heads that finally got me...really? You honestly couldn't find any real little people to act as the dwarves?Other than that the rest of the reviewers sum it up nicely although I think this was not a good role for Charlize."
4,A unique version of Snow White,"The cinematography in this movie is awesome! It was a very unique take on the Snow White story. I wouldn't recommend it for children, but I definitely think its a very interesting and creative movie for adults."
4,Worth a look!,Very entertaining if you like fairy tales. Kristen Stewart not bad. Love the Troll under the bridge and the dwarves!
1,Snow Blow White,What idiot said K. Stewart could act? I guess it is obvious to all now how she gets the parts. I think I saw her blink once and smile once all through the movie. Her only parts involved running and riding a horse. And even then she had no emotion. I almost turned the movie off until Theron came in as queen and saved the day. C. Theron was the only performance worth watching. I have admired her acting ability for many years and she did not disappoint. The action and graphics around the castle were interesting. The Dark Forest was boring and perdictable.
1,"Except for Charlize Theron's acting, the rest of this movie is terrible.","Expressionless and always whispering her lines, K Stewart is miscast in this role as she plays most of the role as somebody who doesn't want to talk and who is hard to root for because she is expressionless and doesn't respond to any conflict. The effects are over the top and, while visually cool to look at, did nothing to add to the movie. Something about the entire film was cold, distant and shallow. Charlize Theron's evil queen was the only thing that created some fire in this movie."
2,If only snow white wasn't in it.,"If only snow white wasn't in it; it could be a great movie. The dialogue between the huntsman & the character definition of the queen are fascinating, bringing a new take on an old classic. However, I still am fast forwarding any of the dialogue of snow white. If only she could have a facial expression that didn't look constipated, that would save it. I'm glad I didn't spend the $ to see in a theatre."
1,Painfully bad...,"(This review is for the EXTENDED version, not the Blu-ray) I admit, I read quite a few of the 1 star reviews before I purchased this, but I thought I'd give it a chance. Well, even though I purchased a used copy, i still spent too much.I don't want to be redundant about what's wrong with this mess of a film, but I will say that the attempt to retell an old story was ridiculously pretentious and so far off the mark that I couldn't finish watching. No, not even Charlize Theron could save this, and Kristen Stewart should get off the casting couch and learn a new trade."
2,Snow White,Stupidest crap movie ever. Theron and Helmsworth are attractive and fantastic.Kristen Stewart barely says two words and theres this whole scene with a stag in the forest that speaks to Snow White's purity and how she's going to bring about the downfall of the evil queen. Its just stupid.Best scene is the huntsman kissing her back to life - his speech is heartbreaking.
2,Dull White,"Yes the characters look great and the special effects are exciting and fun, but the story line is lacking and falls flat in my opinion. This movie could be so much better if they built up the relationships between the characters."
2,This was snow boring,I admit up front I am not a Kristen Stewart fan. But I like Charlize Theron so I wanted to give this movie a fare shot. It's visually beautiful but that's about the only nice thing I can say about the movie. Disappointing.
2,and I paid for this?,"The acting was barely adequate, the story line dropped some key points along the way, elements were introduced that were unnecessary, confusing or pointless, and between the fight scenes, which weren't too awful, it was as if you are waiting for a bus that is late. An, frankly, Kristen Stewart is not the ""fairest in the land"" by any stretch of the imagination.If you can see it for free, it will still a couple of hours you will never get back"
2,Ehh,"I fell asleep during part of this movie because it was so boring. That's not normal for me. It had some good moments but they typically kept my interest by being confusing, not intriguing."
5,Loved it,"I can see why people don't like this movie, but I thought it was very good. It entertained me on a Saturday night of having nothing to do. Not Kristen Stuart's best role play, but you know... you win some you lose some."
4,Snow white,This was an enjoyable film that I wanted to see in the theater. Glad that Amazon had it for rent. I would recommend it to anyone that missed it.
3,Enjoyed the movie but not as much as I could have,This was an interesting story. But it failed to pull me in. But I'm glad a watched it but I will not watch it again.
3,"Eh, it's just OK","I really wanted to see this movie. Even after hearing about the scandal that rocked production.I have to say KSTEW, is the most attractive pouter, that I have ever seen. But after a while, you have to ask, does this girl know how to smile? Or does she even know what a smile is? She just depresses the film to the point where you start to think that you need therapy.Visually, it is a stunning movie, with tons of effects and eye-popping visuals. Which is a hallmark of Rupert Sanders commercial and short-film work. But the plot consists of a ton of events that aren't connected in any way. Which is shocking, since Rupert, is a master at telling a story in his early work. He is also a master of getting you to feel the emotion that his characters are going through. All you feel in this movie is depression. Perhaps, this is a due to the guilt he and KSTEW were feeling due to their on set affair.I really was looking for so more from this film."
3,Good movie,"This movie is a solid three stars. The special effects are great. The story is a good adaptation of the Snow White story. The acting was good, not great, thus only three stars. But, still, a good movie. Charlize Theron makes a good evil queen. So, all in all, a good movie. Thank you."
3,Great performance of Charlize Theron,I watched this movie because it stars my favorite actress Charlize Theron and she did great! It's just another popcorn movie for me.
3,Ok Movie - But Missed Expectations,"My wife and I had high hopes for this film, but it sort of fell short (now I'm glad we weren't able to find time to see it in the theaters)The only actor of any caliber is Charlize Theron and it shows. Kristin Stewart is wooden and Chris Hemsworth, while good in Thor, The Avengers, (and what little we saw him) and StarTrek does not pull it off here - he seems like he doesn't want to be here, like he's contractually obligated to act in the movie.The visuals and audio were great in HD and it wasn't a waste of time - it was entertaining - but it could have been so much more.In hindsight I'm not sure I would pay money to see it, but if it happened to come on cable TV on a rainy Saturday afternoon? Sure."
4,Not so good but not that bad either...,"The only thing I would change in this movie is the adult Snow White... But in general I think is worth to watch; there is a twist from the classic and it is entertaining. I wouldn't pay to watch it in the cinema, though."
3,Snow White & The Huntsman,The only thing I liked about this movie besides all the special effects was Charlene Thezon's character of the queen. She played the part so well of being so evil to the core. She is by far an exceptional actress.
4,Not Your Average Snow White,"This was a very well acted production . The movie was mostly action with little lag time.Out door scenes were fantastic and breath taking.If you like magic, swords and castles, this is your movieDan LaDuke"
3,Not Bad,"Its not bad, cool premise. If Hollywood would stop putting Kristen Stewart in movies, we would all be better off, her facial expressions tell me she is constantly battling constipation and we dont need to watch that for 2 hours."
3,Did not make it all the way thru,"Did not make it all the way through the movie, special effects were good, but kind of the same old story, just being honest, I heard good things, but eventually just existed the program."
3,Sister in law purchased,"Enjoyed it. Just to purchased to pass the time away turned out to be entertaining, the movie needed to buffer often though."
3,Wasn't as bad as many say it is but nothing special,"""As a spin on the Grimm fairy tale and as a stand-alone dark fantasy, it functions much more effectively on a moderate basis than the flamboyant Avatar. In terms of its premise, it functions in bringing a dark and enjoyable environment that works to separate the Disney cliches attached to the film along with some intriguing set designs, laugh-out-loud dry humour from the dwarves, landscape shots, and action featured in a clear, non-cinema verite style. Don't let the mixed reviews disorient the experience for I came in with an open mind and I thought worked better-than-expected with a touch of classic magic found occasionally in a Peter Jackson or dark Jim Henson picture."""
3,Wasn't as good as we hoped,Showed all the good visual affects during the previews. While I'm being told to write 11 more words is also annoying.
3,I Liked it.,"I watched this and thought it was very good. It lacked something, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. It maybe some humorous comments that were made, but really didn't come off on cue. I am not a good critic so I liked the movie, watched it twice but wouldn't buy it unless there was a part 2 that really wowed me."
4,Great adventure,"Enjoyed it, lots of adventure. A fun movie for an evening at home. Beautiful scenery too. I was pleasantly surprised."
3,Hmmmm...,"The parts that you see in the previews are 1/2 of the best parts of the movie, the actors were okay but the story line was lacking, the queen's lines sucked and I am still shocked that there are ""rumors"" or confirmation of a 2nd one being made."
3,Good movie,"I liked this movie but with all the hype about it before it was released, I expected a much larger story. It seemed to end shortly after it began."
3,Great way to spend the night,"a fun dark fantasy that is fun and enjoyable definetly worth the time, look for the version with the UltraViolet tag!"
3,Dark,This has really good special effects and good acting but it was very dark and depressing for a fairy tale. I wish they would have lightened it up a little. I like the actress who played snow white but she was not right for this part- the queen was great!
3,Grown Up Fairy Tale?,"I imagine that critics really hated this one. But being a type who enjoys movies for entertainment rather than artsy and clumsy messages, I liked this one and enjoyed watching it with my young teen-age daughter. I would wish for better, but it's worth a viewing from normal folks looking for something to pass the time."
4,Good Movie.,We totally enjoyed this movie. The Grandchildren also liked watching it with us. Costumes were beautiful. I don't have anything else to say but need more words for this review.
4,Movie,Great besides Kristen Stewart! Not your average love story Snow White movie and can be watched with the family and friends
4,"I liked it, I really liked it.","I'm writing this review basically to offset all the one stars. It is a fairy tale, plain and simple. It's not shakespeare and it's not meant to be. I'm not a Kristin Stewart fan either and I didn't go see it at the theatre because of that. But I rented it and was surprised at how much I liked it. I don't think it deserves the one star that a lot of people are giving it. The special effects are awesome, although to be honest I was dissappointed in the mirror not being a real mirror, but what ever. It was a great fantasy."
4,Good rental,"This movie had greater potential. I though Kristen Stewart brought it down. Her acting seemed a bit forced. I did appreciate the each time there was a shot of the land it became lighter and greener, emphasizing the gain in strength of Snow White and the wasting queen. I do think it is worth renting, but I'm glad I didn't waste the money at the theater."
4,Snow White and the Huntsman,All in all the movie was good. I enjoyed the special effects. Charlize Theron played an awsome evil witch. K Stew proved that she isn't as one sided as I thought she was. I'm a buyer of Blu Ray movies with good special effects. Hope you found this helpful ~ Danny D
3,Just don't c are,The characters just don't make you care. No chemistry between Snow White and the Huntsman. The Queen was the best acted of them all.
5,Chris Hemsworth fan,This was a great movie. The special effects were fantastic. I was already a big fan of Charlize Theron but now I'm also a big fan of Chris Hemsworth.
4,Kept my interest,Good movie. I enjoyed the action and suspense. They spent a little too much time in the Dark Forest but otherwise the movie kept a good pace. I would watch it again.
4,Missing humor,Not enough humor and a stretched departure from the original. But the costuming was excellent and I liked the acting.
1,Unbelievably bad,There are no words to describe how unbelievably bad this film is. There are no words to describe how unvelievably bad this film is.
1,Awful,"Had high hopes from this film, but just came out of the theatre with a bad taste in my mouth (and it wasn't the apple). Theron was the only one with a proper acting job, everything else was overhyped CG and terrible acting. Wouldn't be able to watch it again, even if you paid me. Hope they don't make a second film. Uugghh!"
2,"Cribbed from the following: the Mummy, Gladiator, LOTR, etc etc etc","Save yourself the money and watch any of the many movies that this one copied - all of them are better than this schlock. Kristen Stewart can't emote, much less act (is 20-something too young to overdose on botox?) Charlize Theron chewed so much scenery it's a wonder she has any teeth left, and Hemsworth sounded like he was trying to spit out his lines while holding a mouthful of nails. The dwarves were the only redeeming part and they were vastly underused.And no, I'm not a Twilight fan so I'm not writing a negative review because I feel betrayed by Stewarts's stupidity, though it certainly explains why the director decided to use her. I want my money back!"
1,A boring waste of time and money,"This movie was so bad that it's hard to find words to adequately describe its total ineptitude.They had a couple of good ideas (barely), then added so much fluff that the gems of an idea or two were lost in the shuffle.The actors either shouted or mumbled their way through their lines, and the whole thing turned into one huge jumbled up mess.As for the so-called music! Yuck!"
4,Good movie,"I enjoyed this movie, looks great in hd, enjoyed enough to rent tho, not sure if it's my kind of movie I would purchase"
4,Entertaining movie,"I watch movies to be entertained. This movie did that. It was well acted by all. The story was quite different than what I expected out of Snow White, but I still enjoyed it."
2,Disappointing with mild entertainment,Snow White is a child's fairytale. They should've never touched this one. They could've chosen a better lead actress for the heroine. I have yet to have seen her do a better then average job in any film.
4,Great Verson,I rented it but will eventually purchase this video. I really like the different take on a very popular fairy tale.
2,Painful To Watch,"This is a real stinker. Story was weak and not ""believable"", editing was not great, characters were one dimensional and worst of all this is one of those movies where they try and make every viewer happy and just end up making it no good for anyone."
5,Great fun movie!,"What a fun movie to watch. Action, Drama, Fantasy, all wrapped up in a great movie. You gotta see this one."
2,Dark & Overlong,"Don't expect a faithful telling of Snow White. This film is very dark. Great to look at, but it goes on way too long. Another problem is that Charlize Theron is much more attractive than the actress who plays Snow White! The movie is so dragged out that this review was written while I was watching it!"
4,"Snow White and the Huntsman, a great fantasy","This updated SNOW WHITE hasa good story,good acting and epic scenes.It's a great fantasy film. I put it on the same level as Johnny Depp's ALICE IN WONDERLAND"
5,Great movie!,One of the best movies I've seen. It takes the old fairy tale and makes it into a very good movie.
4,Snow White and the Huntsman,It's great being able to streamline videos from Amazon! The movie was great! I will definitely rent more movies in the future.
2,Kristen Stewart is just awful,"Kristen Stewart has got to be one of the worst actresses of her generation. When not drifting through the movie like a soulless zombie, her attempts at sincerity and passion are almost painful to watch.This may have been a good movie -- especially with powerful actors like Charlize Theron and Chris ""Thor"" Hemsworth, and employing top notch special effects -- but Kristen Stewart is just plain terrible."
2,weak,"All around weak, like a watered down decaf coffee.They try some good special effects but doesnt make up for horrible character development and characters in general."
2,Snow-White bomb,"When did acting become optional instead of a given??? Snow White an actress????? Oh well I only rented it, thank goodness I didn't purchase. I love amazon and have made many wonderful purchases. It is easy, fast without worry thank you."
2,"Cool visuals, cold acting","Kristen Stewart is pretty terrible, and she's on screen almost the entire movie. The visuals are stunning, however. Overall, this is skippable but not quite a waste of time."
2,Snow White &The Huntsman,Poorly written. Not worth your time. Also Flow of the movie was very choppy. The actors? Honestly I feel had nothing to work with.
2,Just OK,"I had high hopes for the movie. However, it was just so-so. Kristen Stewart was very good. Though not her fault, it seemed that Charlize Theron was not well-cast for the role."
2,Mehh,"If you are going to redo a redone.. Do it right. While the Queen was pretty evil, everyone else was so so. Even the effects got watered down by the dry acting. Can we do a another princess please? Maybe a Mandarin, Botswanian, or even of Punjabi origin. The Euro thing is getting mundane for even Hollywood. Yawn. Stretch."
5,Greatly Put,"Well, this was one those childhood awakening moment after all those years noone told me the truth about snow white as this movie has.Basically I have enjoyed it's entertaining nothing specific but different perspective more for adults than children story."
4,Snow Drifting All Over...,"This is a good film. It's a retelling of the classic fable, but, definitely not for children. Don't worry, Thor comes to her aid. Where's Edward Cullen when you need him, Bells? There is not really much more that needs to be said."
3,Ok movie,Typical Snow White movie. Got a little boring in the end. But we all know the ending. So wouldn't rush out to buy it.
4,movie review,Good addition to a blue ray collection. Original renovation to a timeless classic. Not a movie you are going to watch 50 times.
4,Top drawer special effects,"Reasonable twist on the original story.Great special effects, and fast paced.Only let down was a few characters were poorly cast (brother)Dwarfs were superb, and added a little comedy."
4,I would buy it.,"I can't say anything negative but the movie wasn't as fantastic as it looked on previews. Charliez Theoron is gorgeous and rocks her role! Kristen Stewart puts on a convincing performance, but I'm still use to the ""vampire girl"". All in all, the movie is good. I would buy it for my personal collection. The kids in my house did watch it, they liked it as well."
2,Meh,"Okay, so I really wanted to like this movie. But I have to confess, I do not like Kristen Stewart as an actor. She is as flat, annoying and one dimensional in this as she was in Twilight. I guess I was just hopeful that she'd be better. Maybe I was counting on the supporting cast to inspire her to greater emotion and acting ability. Is it wrong that I rooted for the queen? If you want a decent Snow White movie, try Mirror Mirror instead."
4,Better than I Expected...,"I thought this may be a whimsical fairy tale with a little darkness...wrong. It was actually a really great moive, theatrically speaking. I also assumed it was a 'chick flick' but watched this as a date night movie and we both enjoyed it.Charlize Theron is a must see in this one! Oh ... and I don't mind watching 'Thor' either :)!"
1,Just horrible,Bad acting mixed with twisted storyline. Not worth the 5 bucks at all. We're glad that we didn't watch it in theater.
1,Snow White and the Huntsman,Blah movie but that's just me :) I'm not a big Kristen Stewart fan either so that didn't help the movie :)
5,well-done,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was going to be good, but it was even better than I had expected."
1,gee,Pleeeaaase stop sending those irritating emails for a rating. i just got this and havent watched it yet. If I want to review it I will. But stop the spam.
3,"Oh, not bad, I guess","I went into this with raised expectations somewhat, based on a few reviews I had read. Visual effects were amazing (great troll!), but the fact that Kristen Stewart seems to lack the ability to smile made this already dark story a bit overly dark. Would have been nice to have a bit more contrast between good and evil. Kept my attention, but probably wouldn't be one I'd watch again."
3,Interesting Movie,"I am not a Kristen Stewart fan, and this movie didn't change that, but Cherize Theron is a wonderful villain."
3,"Extended edition too long for my taste. Overall, OK but nothing special.","Had to watch because of Charlize and she did not disappoint. Makes a great evil villain. Overall, extended version too long for my taste and lots of slow sections that, I think, did not add to overall plot. Decent enough visual effects, none and again, as if they only had so much money for effects and had to spread them out. How would I classify this movie? Could be a date movie. Not horror or humor. Not just special effects. Not gruesome. Not graphic. No bad language. Familiar plot, sort of. Snow White?? Not sure I see the attraction of the woman, actress, that played Snow White. I am told she from ""Twilight"" series. Worth a look? I guess but nothing special in this movie either in the way of plot, acting or special effects. Well, other than Charlize. Always like Charlize."
1,Truly Horrid!,"They needed to put in more special effects (which were well done, though few and far between), and less, poorly written,and sadly acted convoluted story-line. Kristen Stewart had the same stoned look on her face through the entire movie. Also, on what planet is Kristen Stewart more beautiful than Charlize Theron in any context? As if! Charlize Theron gave the best performance, but not nearly at the level of her other work, and her accent was most annoying. Other than a few interesting special effects, this movie is a total dog."
2,Gave it a shot,"Well, saw this and the cast involved and thought it can't be that bad- wrong. It was long, drawn out and boring as can be. Kristen Stewart was the wrong choice for this movie too- she just didn't fit the profile for the character. If you value your time, do something else."
2,Not worth watch again,"I was so excited to watch ""Snow White & The Huntsman"" but, I was disappointed. It was not what I had expected. The acting was not good, well, except for Charlize Theron...she was exceptional! This movie just didn't do it for me."
1,Snow white and the huntsmen,Bad quality kept freezing and pausing. Seemed like system was slow. Didn't get to watch whole movie waste of my money.
2,Could have been better,Maybe because I'm not a fan of KS. Not at all.Effects were great but overall: meh. Neither here nor there.
4,Fun watch!,This was a fun movie to watch. Did not think I would like it was much as I did. Do recommend.
2,Snow White & The Huntsman,"The acting was not that great and had an awful plot, but the special effects were engaging and entertaining. There are only so many ways you could skin a cat since we all know the story of Snow White."
2,Ehh...,"Not the best, not the worst... Good special effects, the plot was alright. This movie was dragged out, and you could guess what was going to happen next..."
4,Loved this movie!,Saw this movie at the theater and really loved it. Bought a copy to add to my collection. Great special effects!
2,Was looking forward to special effects,"but at one point in the movie it was uber fake looking. And Kristen Stewart always looks like she's trying to be sexy with her mouth open, but it isn't working!"
3,Interesting take on a classic,"The story is an interesting take on a classic, including magic and dwarves. The scenery is well done, backgrounds and people are mostly believable. Most of the acting is good. After hearing Kristen Stewart deliver the line ""I trust you"" in Twilight so many times I was quite unhappy to hear it in this picture. It will go on my shelf and be watched every couple of years, not one of my favorites."
1,Waist of Good Actors,This must have been one of those contract fulfillment that all of the actors had to do. Great Idea no Follow through. Looked like the actors were thinking the same thing and throwing up in their trailers between the scenes. Charlize Theron -- what a drop from the Monster. Waist of Time.
2,Great FX. Bad movie,The special effects and imagery were really great. You will enjoy that part unless you are not a fan of sorcery stuff. The story was fairly incomplete. I wasn't connected to any of the character and hardly any of the relationships had merit.
1,snow white,"I can't rate this because I have never seen this movie, and I bought it as a Christmas gift for my adult son."
4,Rental,"I rented this movie from Amazon and really liked it ... I was surprised at how much I liked in fact. I wish Amazon would let you put the cost of rental towards the purchase price of movies if you buy within 24 hours of renting. If they did, I would have bought this movie. If you are considering renting or buying, I would buy."
2,Snow White and the Huntsman,Did not like the movie. Glad I watched it at home so I didn't waste additional time traveling to the theater!
4,Good movie over all,"Kept my attention, ran a little long in places, but a good twist on the fairy tale. In a letter grade, I give it a B-"
3,Entertaining,3.5 stars folks! It's entertaining enough for a fantasy-adventure with a old tale from childhood. Not a must-see but one you can watch on your leisure.
2,Good start... bad end,"This movie got off to a pretty good start. The filmography was good, and the characters started off with good potential.About half way through the movie, the acting took a sharp decline, and the plot went sideways. The ending left you inching to the edge of your seat but rather than hoping for more, you fell off. It was almost a cliff hanger, but ended up being a real let down instead."
5,Snow White,"Really enjoyed the movie. Didn't know what to expect, so I was pleasantly surprised. Kristen & Charlise did great jobs. Looking forward to part 2."
4,Good Movie,"I liked this movie. Good special effects. I like to watch movies that show the original fairy tales as they were originally written, not the Disney version. This movie is about the ""real"" Snow White story, not the Disney version."
4,Not a bad flick!,"A+ At first I thought it was going to be terrible movie, but in the end it wasn't so bad."
3,little strange,"this movie was little strange nad takes while to get in to the story , very dark at the times and hard to follow the whole story but I guess I would put this one as OK"
3,Snow White & The Huntsman,"The movie is visually beautiful. I get that the queen was wronged in someway when she was younger., would have liked more elaboration on that. And , what exactly was her agenda in taking over Snow White's father's kingdom ? Did I miss that part ? The ending could have been better as well."
2,Shocking .... !!!,"Kristen is not acting just showing facetime, the film is disconnected from the original story which is fine to some extent but their own storyline is not making sense. You can watch this and get some work than at the same time, not really worth paying attention for a long time. Definitely not worth for a movie night."
2,It was hard to pay attention,"after I had seen it in the movie and it was even cheesier on a small screen without the effects. Still liked the costumes, and of Course Charlize Theron is great. But yawn..."
2,Wasn't for me,This movie just didn't captivate me. Very predictable storyline. This movie also confirmed that I'm not a fan of Kristen Stewart.
1,Could not finish watching it,So bad...truly awful..would it have gotten better? Maybe but i was regretting the 30 minutes i wasted..the trailer was pretty good so i was disappointed that the movie did not live up to that....
3,Not as good as the trailers,"After the dazzling visual effects of the trailers, the cast, and the hook of a twist on a well-known story, this was a disappointment. The motivations of the characters were never clear, unlike in the original fairy tale; the movie tried to make the characters more complicated, but didn't bother to make the character development more complicated as well. Glad I saw it at home instead of in a movie theater, though."
2,Snow White and the Huntsman,"It is worth a watch for all of the artwork; the costumes and the sci-fi effects are fun. However, the plot is sadly lacking any creativity and the some of the acting is flat."
3,Charlize Theron out performs them all,"Charlize was excellent as always. Unfortunately, Kristen Stewart only has one facial expression - if you put the sound on mute while Kristen is on screen you will be unable to distinguish the happy screens from the sad scenes because her expression NEVER changes.Watch this movie to see Charlize's performance and the great scenery."
1,boring boring boring and more boring,there is not much to talk about. hardly anything happens in the movie. it could have been trimmed down to a half hour movie. it seems while watching the movie that all they wanted to do was show visual effects. and even then its boring and uninteresting.how this movie made any money at all. let alone nearly 400 million dollars is beyond me. half the people that went to see it must have slept through it. i am very anti stewart. but any twilight movie has to be better than this.
2,Ok but not great.,Movie was just ok. Definetly a rent and not a buy. Very slow in parts and didn't finish the way you might want it to.
2,Not that great,"Thank you Kristen Stewart for ruining another movie.There really isn't a plot line, the love story sucks, Kristen Stewart can't act, and basically this is just not a good movie. Save your money for something better."
1,Fail!!!!!,"Ugh, this movie was disappointing to me! I was waiting the whole time for something to really hit me, and nothing did.Don't pay to see this movie. Anyone who tells you that Stewart was amazing in this movie, has a very odd definition of, ""amazing."" She had about 15-20 lines, not including the speech. There wasn't much acting required on her part and it's so blatantly obvious that it seems intentional."
3,"Visually stunning,","While Stewart is a fine actress, I think someone else would have been better for the part. Charlize Theron was fantastic as was the Huntsman. Couple of moments where it felt like too many different myths or fairy tales were in one script."
3,"Visually stunning, weak story","This movie is a great example of a movie with great visual impact, but unfortunately, I felt it lacked in the story and depth of characters. Some of the scenes are so interesting in their cinematography that you sometimes forget there is no real plot! Ok, I might be exagerating. However, at times it felt forced to contain many unnecessary characters and plots. Is there really a need for fairies in the story? Possibly not. I wanted to like this film, but unfortunately the only really exciting parts were those with great special effects."
3,Good but not great.,"Good movie, but not really worth the purchase. I was expecting a little more out of this movie. You are better off renting it."
3,It was ok,The movie took a while to get going and ended sort of quickly. They tried building a romance and then didn't follow through with it. Ok if you're just looking to watch something to pass the time
3,Not bad,"The movie was decent, but not something I am going to watch again. The vampire girl's lack of acting annoyed me in this movie as much as it did in the vampire series. Other than that, the battle sequences were a little dry and the story was predictable all the way through."
5,Snow White and the Huntsman,This movie was excellent from start to finish. The main people were a pleasure to watch and I thought that they stop makimg movies like this but I was wrong.
4,I am still not buying Kristen Stewart as the fairest of them all...,Overall it was a well written and acted movie. Charlize Theron was the best thing from the movie her portrayal of the queen was spot on.
3,"Great effects, not so great acting.","I enjoyed the effects of the film, but the acting was rather bland actually. It is a good pass the time film."
2,Really boring - visual effects over story line.,"I was looking forward to this movie, thought it would be a neat retelling of a classic. boring, just plain boring. Don't waste your money. They went for visual effects, with very little story."
3,Okay,"This movie was just ok. Charlize Theron was amazing! Kristen Stewart was just ok, but it was a different spin on Snow White"
3,Cinematography is spellbinding.,"Much more closely adapted from the original fairy tale. Charlize Theron as always, is amazing. This is a ""wait for Netflix"" kind of movie."
2,Snow White and the Huntsman,It was an OK movie. Not one of my favorites. But it was alright. I guess that I expected more out of it.
2,Boring and slow,"This just was not a good movie. The story was incredibly slow and even the fight scenes that did pop up from time to time were lacking in excitement. The movie was well shot and the special effects were quite nice, but those weren't enough to make this movie decent. I would not recommend watching this movie even if it were free on TV."
2,Kind of sucked,The Stewart girl is a really bad actress an it shows I. This movie. There was so much more thy could have been done with this movie. Predictable and lame.
2,Disappointing,"I looked forward to seeing this movie for months, however I was disappointed in the end. For the most part, this was an excellent movie, the cinematography was fantastic, the story was great, the supporting actors were fabulous (Charlize Theron as the Queen was just perfect).However the leading role was very poorly played. The actress showed virtually no emotive skills. I just could not sympathize or identify with Snow White, because the role was played so incredibly poorly.It's a shame. This could have been a great movie."
2,Not as good as hyped up to be!,"Disappointing! With all the hype this movie got, we thought this would be an awesome movie. It was a dud, just didn't live up to the hype for us."
1,Don't buy it,Is one of the worst movies I have seen. I would not recommend it. I suppose some people had to like it but I am not one of them.
2,Just Ok,"Charlize makes the movie works, except for that... Kristen Stewart makes any movie be boring, this girl can't show any emotion, is unbelievable."
1,Terrible,"I could write a 20 page essay on everything that's wrong with this movie. But instead, I will just sum it up. It's terrible. Boring. Pointless. Frustrating. Don't waste your time with it, just like I'm not wasting my time reviewing it."
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought the DVD version, and I wished I'd used my money on something else. They took all the best bits to create the trailer, and that made the movie look like it was going to rock. It didn't. I considered this a huge letdown. I've always loved Theron's acting, but she was just this side of campy trying to fit into the fairytale genre. The movie literally drags in many places...I wondered to myself if I was going to make it through it without falling asleep."
3,Snow White and the Huntsman,"I enjoyed most of the movie. However, the casting for the part of Snow White lowered the quality of this production."
3,"Okay movie, maybe too long.","It's a run of the mill movie for this genre. Needed more character development in my humble opinion. But, still a fun movie if you like fantasy and swords action."
3,"Dark and visually nice, but rather shallow","I didn't approach Snow White and the Huntsman with high expectations, and the movie did not disappoint. The visuals are interesting, and the previews provide a good impression of the dark atmosphere of the film. I think it really falls down in two areas: characters and plot. I didn't find any of the characters three dimensional enough to care about. It seemed like significant effort was put into making us understand the wicked queen, but I didn't find those efforts successful. The wicked queen's brother was a complete, disturbing mystery. The storyline was okay, and a lot happened during the film, but the plot meandered around without a whole lot of focus or intentionality. And at the end (no spoiler), there was an odd, dramatic pause that felt like it should mean something, but I have no idea what. Overall, an okay production that could have been better with more character development."
4,Great Movie!,This isn't a child's movies. Adults only! Really enjoyed watching it! I highly recommend this movie! Great story and good cast!
3,Entertaining and Well Done,"It is worth seeing and a great retelling of the Snow White story, but not a great movie overall. Would watch it again some day, but won't buy it."
3,2012 Snow White,It was okay. I'm glad I rented it and not purchased it. Some of the special effects were good and the huntsman was hot.
3,Snow White and the Huntsman,This movie was just ok. I would not watch it again. It was lacking in many ways. Just did not hold my attention.
3,Meh,"A lot of the themes are mediocre reproductions from better films such as Lord of the Rings. There's not much that's memorable here. I found myself wishing for the end about an hour into it. Still, not a bad film - there is some entertainment value in the scenery. Also, there is no way that Kristen Stewart is more ""fair"" than Charlize Theron. The entire theme if the movie is pretty darn laughable because of that casting choice alone."
3,Not bad,Movie wasn't too bad. Don't pay more than $1.99 to rent it. The acting wasn't too terrible except for the twilight actress.
4,New take,Pretty good take on Snow White. Everyone played their roles well. Charlize Theron definitely rocked her part as the evil queen.
4,Good Movie!,Great VFX and all around a good movie. I'd probably give it a good 7.5 out of 10. The sequel will be interesting...
5,a very good Flim to watch,when i first rented this movie i liked it.good casting on this movie i do not have any bad points to this flimall i can say its really good
3,To be expected,"This was a late-night purchase and it's exactly what I expected it to be: some action, some special effects, some terrible acting by Kristen Stewart. It is what it is."
3,Worth Watching only because of Charlize Theron and the Dwarves,"Charlize Theron can both act even in a fantasy farce and be so stunningly beautiful, what a combo!!! The presentation of the dwarves totally defeat the appearance of the unconvincing dwarves in Lord of the Rings. Charlize and the Dwarves alone are worth watching, actually they are the only things worth watching in this film and make it okay rather than bad."
3,Surprisingly not bad,"When I rented the movie I was thinking what the heck, why not. To my surprise I was impressed with all aspects of the movie. The Twilight Star seemed to really to a good job from separating herself from what she is known for. You can really never go wrong with Charlize Theron, and Chris Hemsworth is definitely coming along...seems to be natural for him. I would def recommend this movie."
3,good and bad acting,"Charlize is, as always, up to the task of infusing new life and dimension into a well-known character we've seen (or imagined) many times. Bravo to her performance. Stewart, on the other hand, is as drab and uninteresting as in every other film she's done (and I'm pretty sure I've seen them all). I went into this hoping to see her finally do something different for once, but it just doesn't happen. Not that all Snow Whites have to be sweet and innocent and Disney-esque, but she provides absolutely no reason to cheer for her character. It got to the point where I was hoping a huge new twist would happen and that the Evil Queen would triumph in the end!"
3,Ok,I watched this movie because i thought it would be great. Acting was ok Snow White cant act. Glad she didnt have to many lines. But over all OK
3,Pretty dark story,"A good movie overall. Pretty dark story, Charlize Theron is pretty creepy. The quality of this movie rental from amazon was pretty bad. It was very grainy and fuzzy at many parts. This is unusual however for amazon."
1,Skip it,Dull and uninspiring - the only good thing was that I didn't see it in the movie theaters and could fastforward through the really painfully bad moments (there were quite a few of those). You are better off watching Stardust or Enchanted ... movies which have much better storylines and above all acting.
3,a little dissapointing,"Cool idea. Pretty good story. Of the three main characters - snow white, the queen, and the huntsman, snow white was the only character that never got developed. You rooted for her, but you were never really sure who she was."
1,quality sucked,"I purchased in HD from a Roku, which said it had an excellent signal strength and the quality sucked, standard definition at best"
3,Eh,"Not a waste of money, but was hoping for better. Should have known better with Kristen Stewart in it. Chris Hemsworth is surprisingly good, Charlize Theron is surprisingly mediocre and the whole thing sort of feels like it was a cut and paste job."
2,pretty awesome cgi... and that's about it,"I decided to watch this despite kind of hating Kristen Stewart (with the exception of Panic Room) because the visuals in the trailer seemed pretty amazing-- I mean, the Mirror is a gold dripping figure, the contrasts of the snowy forest and the castle on fire, the epic Charlize Theron-bathing-in-milk sequence... just looked like visual candy to me. So I went for it... Yea, it wasn't worth it. You get all the best bits in the trailer-- seriously. The trailer is a better film than the actual movie. Kristen Stewart is predictably awful. You get the feeling Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron are kind of trying but their characters are just as flat as the green screen this shit was shot against. So mostly I just felt bad for them.Sucks, because more than once I got the feeling that, at any moment, the writers/directors could have turned it around. There was real potential here. But in the end its just a bunch of fluff. Unsatisfying and kind of boring too."
3,Disapponting Ending,"The story line was fine, but with all of the build up of Snow White going mano-a-mano with the Wicked Queen, I thought that the ending scene was not very exciting. I thought they could have done more with Chris Hemsworth's Woodsman character in that scene."
4,Snow White,I like the movie itself and the storyline. However I'm not a big fan of Kristen Stewart. I don't know what people see in her and she seems emotion-less in most of her acting.
2,Meh,"It was all like ""You're evil. No I'm good! OK, let's run! Look out! Kill the Queen! Annnnnd roll credits."""
2,I don't get it,Poor story line. The movie was carried with excellent acting by some characters. Something was definitely lacking here. I would not rent it again.
2,Kristen Stewart is pretty bad...,"This movie is an interesting, adult take on the classic children's story. Charlize Theron does a wonderful job; however, Kristen Stewart leaves a lot to be desired. The story is weak in places and relies on special effects to carry it. It may save you some time if you say you saw it and don't."
1,Kristen Stewart definitely is cursed with one facial expression,This could have been a good movie. The plot was decent but Kristen Stewart killed it all with her facial expression. and her terrible acting skills. The movie was good quality though.
3,Stewart blows a great flick,"I enjoyed this movie so much more when Kristen was not on the screen. The dwarfs are hilarious. Could have been a cult classic. Stewart plays snow white and she is supposed to have a strong heart, but she (and her acting) is weak!"
