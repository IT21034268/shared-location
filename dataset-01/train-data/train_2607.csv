2,Cheaply Made,I would not have bought this if I would have physically been able to see it first. It is cheaply made.
1,Just letting you know,"The zipper on mine broke after only a couple days of use. It wasn't a huge surprise as the product felt very cheap overall. Also the Plastic CD holders are designed in a very annoying manner - the location of the cut where you insert the CD is too high, which makes it a pain to even put the CDs in their holders, and almost impossible to put any type of paper behind them (i like the put the album art from the CD case behind teh CDs)."
1,false advertising,"i never received the rebate from this company. i sent in 2 inquiries on their website - there's no listed number, how convenient - and have yet to receive any kind of response. the case itself is fine, but the whole reason i bought it was for the rebate. i feel ripped off."
3,Not a bad buy for the price I paid,"Pros: Its massive capacity, you will be able to keep most of your cds/dvds in one case. According to the description the case can hold 320 cds/dvds but the case I received can hold 336 (42 * 8) cds/dvds.Cons: Its unattractive look, not as good looking as other cases in the market. As other reviewers mentioned there was this bad smell intially. I was able to get rid of the plastic smell by keeping the case in the open air for couple of days. This is why it gets 3 stars.Overall, its worth the money I paid (around $6 after MIR of $20 - assuming I will receive the MIR)"
5,"Clear recipes, beautiful photographs, great snippets, drool!","I was astounded by the inviting photographs and the seemingly easy recipes. The little stories behind the dishes are a great addition. I lived in Vancouver, BC for a while and my husband is from there and we both have a case of nostalgia when we read the book....as well as constantly licking our chops...."
5,I'm looking for a copy of this book . . .,"Please contact me at either : hiltonpu@fedsure.co.za . . . or P O Box 371, Noordhoek, 7975, South Africa Many thanks!"
3,"beep, beep, beep-beep","My 5 year old loves them, despite that they have a very, very limited range - only a few feet, I would estimate. That said, you can press a button on the front, and get the KP beep sound. The cartoon on the front is one of those dual ""hold at a different angle to see the other picture"" dealies. The antenna is bound to break off at some point, just a matter of time at this age..."
1,Very disappointing,"We bought this at Toys R Us. When we brought it home and found it didn't work at all, I decided to see what Amazon customers were saying about it. Had I checked here first (my daughter fell in love with it at the store) I would have known better than to waste our time on it. Ah well...Live and learn."
5,BRILLIANT SATORI,Buddhists and people living close to Nature often have the same philosophy of being in the moment and trying to extinguish the narrow self to let the whole world in. In INSIDE PASSAGE Michael Modzelewski is much like a Zen student with Nature his teacher. This book is filled with moments of brilliant satori or enlightenment.
5,AS GOOD AS BEING THERE,"I took a cruise with girlfriends through the Inside Passage to Alaska and our travel agent recommended that we all read this book along the way. I've often heard the expression that a book or other art form is ""the next best thing to being there."" But in all honesty, Michael's INSIDE PASSAGE is just as good as being there and on some pages even better than the real thing. What a wild man and yet such a sensitive poet. He uses words like an inspired lover!"
2,disappointing: first people who speak like 'heap-big injuns',"Having visited the exact place described in the book twice in the last five years to see the resident orcas, I found myself asking why the author would exaggerate distances and descriptions so wildly. Certainly, the place is stunning in its beauty, but it felt as if he needed to make his experiences there so over-dramatic that it turned me off....way off."
3,Interesting but too idealistic,"Quick read. Definitely worth it if you have been or are going to be in the region. Some of his scientific stuff is a little off but it's not the right book if you are looking for exacting detail on these subjects. Modzelewski's perspectives were very idealistic and I found it a little difficult to believe that the experiences he relates were quite a spiritual or mind altering as he sometimes makes them seem. The author does pull series of stories or facts together well. The chapters addressed themes - like the tribes, animals, the island's owner, etc. Modzelewski doesn't try to tell you everything there is to know about any of these subjects but selects what he thinks is interesting and relates it briefly. Often the points he makes or the stories he chooses to tell are not ones that you might have expected."
4,Inside Passage again and again,"We went on an Alaska Cruise about a month ago, and we were privileged to have Michael lecture to us on that cruise. He presented 4 slide shows, and we were spell bound by his words and his pictures. We purchased his book to read when we returned home just to relive our trip. I dipped into it the night I bought it (after his second lecture) and could not put it down. I finished it the next day!! This was our 4th trip to Alaska, and his book captures the grandeur and the spiritual quality of that special place. Thank you Michael for sharing your heart and soul with us."
5,Richard III-A Story of the Last Plantagenents,"This was a well-written and exciting novel about Richard III and his struggles as brother to a king and later a king himself. His love and later Queen, Anne Warwick is portrayed here as a strong female individual, not the simpering, scared woman who appears in other novels.The cast of characters includes: Edward IV, King and brother to Richard, Warwick (the Kingmaker) himself constantly making a bid for power, George Duke of Clarence, also brother to Richard, who plans to take the crown for himself, Louis XI, the Spider King and a surprising appearance of Thomas Mallory, author of Le Mort d' Arthur, who plays an integral part in the plot, plus many others.This tale also showcases how Richard III, in the face of constant treachery, remains loyal to crown and country. It also depicts what life may have been like for those living and dying in the turmoil of medieval England, and how the Plantagenets paved the way, for good or bad, for the Tudor Dynasty."
4,Love it !,"I purchased this for my 17 weeks old Malamute puppy to play with. They look like twins together. My puppy is slightly bigger than this dog. She started to wrestle and then fell a sleep by this dog. Now ""they"" are always together. It's pretty durable and it stands. I don't know how long it lasts but this is a great toy for my puppy for now."
4,"Soft, good quality toy dog","My niece loved this stuffed dog, it was half the size of her which she adored! Its can stand up or lay down. Be brushed and used as a pillow. It does not shed and has cute facial features.I am disappointed that they DID NOT include the gift card I filled out when I ordered it thru Amazon. Oddly,There was nothing in the box, just the dog!!? She had to call around to see who sent it."
3,Be aware fur is not always the same,"I ordered 3 dogs, and while they are very cute, I am terribly disappointed with the fur. One of the dogs has short, very soft fur, and the other 2 have a longer pile fur that is kind of curly, not soft, and has an oily looking finish...definitely not as nice. Using these for a photo shoot, so don't have time to exchange 2. One would think that with an order of 3, they could send the same fur. :("
3,"Cute, Large Husky","Dog is cute, daughter (7) loves it, not as sturdy as was hoped for, but is okay --great size"
5,Detroit 187,"This was a great show. Very good chemistry between the characters. It was also helping the economy of the City of Detroit with the jobs created in the filming of the series, on location in Detroit. I don't know why the network canceled this show.As usual Amazon had the best price and free shipping. Everything was easy and efficient."
4,;0),"This is another good cop show. I love that they are not focus on one set of cops but the division. It has a feel of The shield and Law and Order without the Order, it tackles 2 story lines/murder mystery a episode instead of one throughout the episode. The season has been going good for a while and hope it comes back for a second season. Also have to say Michael Imperioli is holding his own and is doing some good acting in this show, he did a couple of episodes of law and order a few years back so I'm not surprise, good job to him and the cast."
5,Detroit 1-8-7 ABC Needs to Reconsider,"I am so glad to see that this will be coming out and am pleased to place my advance order. This was the best show to come out last year and I am extremely disappointed that ABC pulled the plug. It sure would be nice if they would see the error of their ways and bring it back for a second season. A better time slot might help, but seeing a comment here from Australia demonstrates that the show has broad appeal."
2,Imperioli Deserves Better,"Like myself, I suspect people watched this show because Michael Imperioli was in it. I was expecting something more real and edgy. Who wants to watch a bunch of clown detectives? The police on Barney Miller were more realistic and that was a comedy. I would suggest the writers of this show watch The Wire to see how to put together something more interesting."
2,Meh. Much Ado About Nothing,"I used to live in Detroit. Believe me, no show can or should try to match the depressing experience of actually living in ""The D."" Detroit doesn't deserve a show, especially one that tries to portray it as a city with hope. It's too bad the talents of Michael Imperioli and the rest of the talented cast couldn't have been put to better use than in this mess of a series. So glad it got cancelled. If I want to watch the Detroit crime spill over into the suburbs, I can watch the 6 o clock news."
3,The glass is half full,"Search and Destroy is an underrated gem that deserves a bigger audience. Frankie the Fly is 5th-rate Tarintino best left forgotton. RIP Dennis, you will be missed."
3,not that accurate,Bought this and cooked chicken. The temp kept reading 130 degree and I kept on and on testing the chicken for the desired temp and never got the thing to read over 130. So my chicken was done 15 minutes ago and now it's dried out because the thermometer didn't read right.
1,Didn't work out of the box,"LCD display was faulty, only displayed partial numbers/letters, was impossible to read. Didn't bother ordering another, just sent it back for a refund."
1,It doesn't indicate the correct temperature,The thermometer reads 15 degrees higher than it should (we checked it with a second standard thermometer at the same time).
4,"Works well, mostly","I ordered this remote thermometer after seeing a brief review in the Wall Street Journal. I find that it works well and reports temperatures quite accurately, more so than other electronic thermometers I've tried. I don't consider it ""perfect"" for two reasons:1. There are two components - the sender and the receiver. You have to turn them on or reset them in the right order for them to communicate with one another. I don't use this frequently and always need to refer to the instructions to get them talking to one another.2. The transmitter range is so-so in my house (wood frame, two stories). The receiver loses touch with the transmitter if I take it more than a room away from the kitchen. It would be nice if it worked all around the house."
2,"Great, while it works","I had this about 2 years.I liked the functionality BUT about 1 year into it one probe quit working (it was the probe, not the plug or transmitter. The problem followed the probe).Then a second year and the unit quit altogether (could have been the second probe).You know, something with a two year life is ok BUT I only probably had 20 hours of use on this thing. That isn't reasonable for the money I spent."
5,"At last, something to save me from opening the smoker","I love to smoke meats, but I HATE what it does to my hair every time I open the door to check for done-ness. Now, with this probe and the remote control thermometer, I no longer have to check anything. When the sensor detects the correct internal temperature, I know my meat is done. I used to hate coming to the table with smokey scented hair. I no longer have that problem for I can turn off the electric element and just let the smoke settle. It did take me a little bit longer to get it figured out than I expected, but once I did, it was just the ticket. You will be happy with this monitor."
1,redicheck,"The remote thermometer didn't work. Sitting about 20 feet away, the remote was about 10 degrees different than the probe. Once I got closer, it starting changing. And once I got next to the probe, it finally registered correctly."
2,Undone by crummy temperature probes,It's convenient to be able to monitor the temperature of something being grilled remotely. It worked very well for grilling a turkey. But the probes that come with it are very poorly made and only lasted 2 uses. They do not survive actual grill temperatures. There are supposed to be higher temperature probes available that work with this unit. I've ordered some and will see if they work better. The ones that come with the unit are worthless.
2,"Looked great, but died after only two uses","The first two times I used this, it worked great. I like the changing color feature, red for cold, blue for almost ready, and green for ready ( and beeping).But then I discovered that the range is only about 30 feet, which really wasn't far enough to take the remote unit into the house. One demerit.The third time, the probe died for no reason, giving the dreaded HHH error message on the unit. And that was it. Back to the store with it.It seems like there really is not a good remote grill thermometer on the market. We tried this oneGrill Alert Talking Remote Meat Thermometerand it too failed after one use.Ended up with this non-remote thermometer which is great for the money.RT600C Super-fast Water-resistant Digital Pocket Thermometer"
2,Works well....at first,"I bought this thermometer last year and it worked great for the first 7-8 months (I used it 3-4 times/month). In the last few months the probes have become completely inaccurate, reading much higher than the actual meat temperature. I can't recommend this product as I think the probes should last a lot longer under light usage."
1,Inaccurate temperatures,"I used this with no problem for several years. One day I used this on a turkey and it was underdone. Then I realized the problem is that the reading was 20 degrees higher than real temperature. It was saying that room temperature was over 100 degrees.It was disappointing because we use this to accurately cook our meats such as poultry and pork and I can't depend on it. If it's 20 degrees over this time, it may be 23 next time, etc. I will not risk food poisoning with this item."
5,Works Great!,"If you like to BBQ and you don't like to sit outside and check the meat every few minutes, then this is the thing for you! You can set it to beep (from 100 yards away) after a set time or temperature."
1,Broken after 2 uses,"I just got this unit a month ago and I've used it twice. The first time it worked perfectly and was the same temperature as another thermometer we have, so I was really happy with. The second time it started saying HHH which I guess means it's too hot. But it's meant to be used with a BBQ, and that's what I was using it for. I thought maybe if I tried taking the batteries out and letting it 'reset' might help, but no such luck. I think the temperature probe is broken. It must have been cheaply made. I will try contacting the company, but unfortunately, I just want my money back, not a replacement. I spent $50 in the store, now I know I could have spent it on a better unit."
2,Remote numbers always lag behind transmitter numbers.,The remote readings always lag behind the transmitters readings. This caused me to over cook a roast the other day. I wish I would have skipped a thermometer with the remote feature because it can't be trusted ! I really can't recommend this unit.The transmitter reading are fine it's just that it doesn't transmit its signal to the remote very well.
1,Worked great for one use,The wireless worked great the first time. I was very pleased until I tried to use it the second time and every time since. What a disappointment. My suggestion is don't waste the money.
1,This is a Piece of Junk,"It worked once, the transmitter doesn't work any more. I have tried the high power lithium batteries it will work for a few minutes then the base unit loses the signal. Very poor engineering compared to other remote thermometers."
1,"Worked great for awhile, now doesn't work","I got this as a gift and loved it. After a couple of months, the unit stopped transmitting to the remote. Too bad, I wish it still worked, now I'm looking for its replacement."
2,Buy a simple meat thermometer,"I have been unable to get the base unit to communicate with the remote, regardless of the distance separating the two. Would have been better off with Mr. Fariehheit's original thermometer."
2,There are cheaper better ones that work faster,"I have been BBQing large cuts of meat for a long time and I wanted a probe to monitor the internal temps of the meat instead of lifting the lid very hour or half hour and stabbing it to check. (especially the dreaded stall) My first probe was a cheap 20 dollar one from the company taylor and the readings were fast. This one takes a long time to read the temps so if your cooking multiple peices, you waste a lot of time. The wireless monitoring deal was what got me to buy it but unfortunately it blanks out even if you in the range.It is accurate though but if it were faster at its temp readings and if the connection did not drop between devices I would give it 5 stars"
4,Better than the old one,Bought this to replace a Pyrex model that had stopped functioning correctly. Seems to be pretty accurate based on cooking results. It does take some time and usually 3-5 resets to get the remote and the base unit to start communicating.
2,Buyer Beware: Unreliable,"When it works, it works great. However, we have experienced problems with the probe reading HHH, even when inserted in meat. After replacing the probe, we had no problems for a few days, then the same problem again. We use a probe at least twice a week. If you need a reliable product, keep looking. The reliablility issue is too big to over look."
3,Beeping Crazy,"If you get it read the manual, you can adjust the min and max settings for the meat. I didn't read the manual at first and it was very frustrating.The remote has limited functionality and a bug. It only works for the preset temperatures which has a minimum temperature of 160 degrees for pork which is overdone for a tenderloin. Further if you use the timer mode, it still beeps when the temperature is greater than the meat setting. You can't use this to monitor the temperature of your smoker unless you're temperature is less than 180 degrees or you want it to beep every 3 minutes."
1,Lasted only with original batteries,"I received this as a gift. Loved it. Finally I didn't overcook my chicken for once. Being a mom of 2 small children I didn't want to risk anything. It worked great. The batteries first went in the unit that the probe hooks into. Changed them and then it only worked some of the time. It would freeze up and read a different meat than what I had set it for. When the actual remote batteries died, I replaced them with new batteries and the unit wouldn't even come on. Trashed it. I just went back with my basic thermometer."
5,Whatever goes up must come down! Great to make the 360 circle for potential engineers,Whatever goes up must come down! Great to make the 360 circle for potential engineers. Recommend it for students considering engineering major.
2,SMELLS good but.....,Smells good but didn't do much help at all.price should be lowered to $2.99 that's all.nothing special.I would say that it's over priced for a non working so-called pheromones.
3,routine Item,"This product fit my camera, as was expected. Since I live in a dusty environment, a desert area in Nevada, I wanted to cover my hot shoe to keep it clean. Since this is such a small item, I really don't understand why Sony does not include it with the camera. The source of many of their current offerings, Konica-Minolta, used to include it. At least it was on the three Minolta's that I had owned. I just was not smart enough to keep the cover from the Minolta that I traded for my Sony DSLR. It just had not occured to me to validate that it was included with the new camera. I just assumed that it would be."
5,"GUNDAM Wing Fans, This!!!","This is an awsome manga! When I first started to read this, I thought,""Okay, so another great manga to read!"" but I was far off from what should have been said. It's more than great! I really can't describe it in actual words... The eyes, among the other various places hard to draw on the face in manga style, are incredibly detailed. The artist took a lot of time making things just perfect, and it really shows. The emotion of Mobile Suit Fighter GUNDAM Wing: Episode Zero is unbelievable, and the bishounen (Pretty Boys, you know, what girls consider sexy) will keep even girls reading. There are a bunch of different stories in this book, explaining Duo Maxwell, Hiro Yui, Trowa Barton, and others pasts up to the beginning of GUNDAM Wing. If you like GUNDAM Wing, or any of the GUNDAM series (or just great art), pick up this book; it's worth a read or two!!!"
4,My opinion about Ultimate French : Basic - Intermediate,"I like this book very much. It contains a complete French course for beginner. Native speaker-spoken dialogues, pronunciation guide, vocabulary, grammar usages, and excercises + key. You can rely on this book for studying French. Unfortunately there is not enuogh excercise. There's only 5 questions each section. That's why I put 4 stars for it. Otherwise, I would have put 5. To the author: if you want to publish a new edition of this book in the future, add some more excercise, 15-20 questions each section will do."
3,Do you really want to learn French?,"I've used different language sets to learn, or start to learn, a few languages and now have a clear idea of what works & what doesn't. Most sets are designed for the non-serious student who wants something ""easy"" or flashy. The problem with these is that you don't end up learning the language. Ultimate French is very high quality and even fun, but its method is not for the serious student. The drills are very weak. A series with audio tapes/CDs that works is the Foreign Service Institute lessons. These are also marketed by Barron's and the National Audio-Visual Center. I haven't tried Pimsleur, though."
4,More Exercises Please,"""Ultimate French"" is not an easy course book and I can understand some people's reservations. However, I have found it to be the most comprehensive and enjoyable book for adults who want to embark on a serious pathway to French language success. I began studying with the ""Living Language"" series (which I also recommend for drill practice) but eventually I wanted something that contained more than phrases. After exploring numerous options, ""Ultimate French"" was the only one which appealed to me and after purchasing the coursebook and audio cd's, I am more than pleased with my purchase. I echo other reviewer's dissatisfaction with the exercises after each chapter though. In fact, I emailed the publisher and suggested they provide a supplementary book just for exercises. Despite this shortfall, I recommend ""Ultimate French"" as a thorough introduction to the French language. I am looking forward to starting the Advanced course."
2,Disappointing,"How do you fit ""two years of college French"" into such a small book? Only touch upon topics briefly. The CDs are even worse. Basically select parts of each lesson are read once on the CD with pauses for you to repeat. Each CD lesson corresponds to a lesson in the book and is less than ten minutes long. Since even a dedicated student would would have trouble doing more than one lesson per day, you're looking at 10 minutes of audio per day max. That just doesn't cut it for someone who wants to really learn a language. The book would make a decent supplement to a good audio course and the audio portion of this course would make a less than ideal companion to some good books. Combined you get a course that is severely lacking. For a great audio course I recommend the Pimsleur series."
5,One of the best French courses available (if not THE best)!,"After trying a few other ""highly recommended"" books I found the one that really works for me. I totally love it! The dialogs are fast-paced, close to natural speech and easy to follow. The explanations are very clear and pronounciation on CD is flawless. All grammar is presented in a very systematic way (unlike other books). And the best thing: the lessons are designed in such a way that you always stay motivated and ready for more (at least that's how it works for me). Nicely priced, too!"
2,NOT STURDY,This high chair was time consuming to assemble and turns out difficult to take apart. The chair was extremely wobbly. Looks nice but not sturdy.
3,tray too high!!,It's a nice highchair but the tray is way too high. My son is ten months old and it comes to his chin. Otherwise the chair is nice. Not worth the extra money to get the toy. I would recommend getting the cheaper model that evenflo makes. My mom got it and the tray is lower and has the same features as this one except doesn't have the toy.
1,Awful to assemble,"My husband and I dread the day we actually have to use this chair. I registered for it after reading the positive reviews online. However, of all the baby things I have put together, nothing was as hard as this high chair. I wrestled with it for hours, trying to get the cheap plastic to conform to the poor instructions. I thought maybe it was just me. But, my husband (who is extremely handy) had as much difficulty as I did. Also, once folded up, the chair still takes up a lot of room and the removeable tray will not rest on the back hooks when you don't need it. The chair pad seems food resistant, however, it will not stay strapped on by the arms. I just saw an ad that Graco has a new assembly free high chair for the same price and I just about died. I feel bad that I registered for the Magestic and that my poor aunt actually wasted her money on it. I have a feeling we will buy a new chair rather than deal with man handling this high chair everyday. What a waste!"
2,Karina,"We bought two of these for our twins. So far, they have been great since our twins only weigh 20 lbs at 9 months. To my surprise, my 2 year old, 35 lb nephew, came over Easter weekend and we sat him in the high chair to eat... the seat looked like a ""low-rider"". I could not believe it. He couldn't even eat because he was leaning so far back. I thought we made a good investement for our twins, but unfortunately, it was a waste of money and I have to go shopping for two new high chairs. They are great chairs up until your child reaches about 30lbs."
2,BAD DESIGN,"THE CHAIR IS GREAT UNTIL YOUR CHILD IS OLD ENOUGH TO EAT ALONE, THEY CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO REACH THE TRAY OR PLAY WITH THE ATTACHING TOY, THE SEAT DOES NOT SIT UP HIGH ENOUGH. THIS WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY."
2,safety issues,"we bought this chair a few months ago and constantly have a problem with the screw that holds the back of the chair upright and in place flying off every time my son puts pressure on it.we have put the screw back on so many times, but it keeps happening. im worried that the other screw will also fly off and my son will be hurt when the back of the chair falls off/backwards.hoping evenflo solves this issue for me."
4,Wasn't What I Wanted,"I wanted the one without straps sense I had heard there was so many problems with them, but for whatever reason I got this one instead. The prolems with the straps are true and I am no longer using them. Other then that it is good as far as price, workout, and a good stepper. I am about 180lbs, just had a baby, and this was recommended to me to help get my weight off sense going to a gym at this stage isn't something I can do. I am confident this plus, good diet, and my weights I use at home will get back in shape."
4,Good Buy!,"For the price, this product is a pretty good buy if your on a low budget. This machine gives a pretty good workout if you are willing to really work out. You have to get used to maintaining your balance at first but you get the hang of it after a few minutes of exercising. I recieved it very quickly, so this has a very fast shippment. At least for me it did. I can use it while doing almost anything because it can fit everywhere. =P"
2,mini stepper review,"THe machine was delivered on time and in good condition. However,it is very difficult to operate. My daughter only weighs 100 pounds, and it is hard for her to push down on the steps. I called about the stiffness of the steps and was told to oil the shocks. My husband did this, but they are still very stiff. My daughter wanted more of a cardio work-out. THis machine is much too slow for that."
3,Good for home exercise,"Does Amazon screen the feedback? I will try again to leave a review. Anyway, this is a great small equipment for home exercise. My only complaint is it heats up really quickly. You can actaully smell the plastic. So read manual before using it. So far I haven't had any problem, but it certainly raise my safety concerns."
1,Useless,"I purchased the unit to use as an in-home cardio exercise. It started making noise after about 10,000 steps. The cheap bolts used to connect the cable ends to the pedals broke after 2 months. (within one week of replacing the first with a Real Bolt, the other one snapped.) The cable had begun to actually twist and deform, and the coating was beginning to melt from the friction with the pulley. Finally, after 3 months of 4 days per week use, the cable which alternates the up/down pedal motions completely failed, and the unit is beyond repair. It appears that the machine was designed for the typical buyer: someone who will buy it, use it for a week and then forget where they stored it. If you are serious about exercise, this unit is USELESS."
2,Broke in under 2 months.. BUT...,This was working fine and I was very happy with it but then the cable broke that goes between the two steps. Amazon would not refund/return it as it was over 30 days (buyers beware of that policy!) and so I contacted the manufacturer directly and then sent me a new cable. So shame it broke - but good to know the manufacturer would send out a replacement part free of charge.
1,Stamina Instride Plis Electronic Stepper,"when I saw the ad for the strider on tv, I thought it would be a great help for me to strenthen my legs and knees. When I received it and put it together I was very dissapointed with it. I did not have the strength to work out on it. Plus it was hard for me to keep my balance on the strider.So sorry to say it didn't work for me. I had hopes that it would.Just wish I could have gotten my free shipping money back. I had to pay it because I just couldn't use the item. Phyllis Mental"
2,Too bulky,"I thought I would be able to take this to work with me and carry it back and forth, but it is way to big and bulky. Even trying to carry it from one room to another it is heavy and hard to carry. I have tried it and it is a bit awkward too. You have to have a sense of balance which may be a challenge for some."
2,Not worth it,"I returned this stepper after trying it a couple times. The main problem is that the foot pedals are too close together. It hurt my hips and knees since they were at an awkward angle while stepping. Also, if your feet are too far back on the pedals it will flip over!"
2,Not so nice for the knees...,"I ordered this portable elliptical trainer for in-house use. The good parts are that the price is right, the parts that come with it are useful, and set up is easy. The down side is that the resistance on this elliptical is not adjustable and it is set to a hard resistance. The result is that the knees really feel it. My knees are fine and I want to keep them that way: this was not the elliptical for me. It came out of the box and went back in the very same day."
3,Not Durable,I really liked this stepper while it lasted. I used it quite a bit (2-3 times a week for 15 to 20 minutes). It works well. I don't use any of the extras. My main problem with it is that I have bought two of these and each time the metal band has snapped. I weigh 185 pounds. In both cases it lasted for a few months of regular use and then it breaks. You can get these things on sale pretty cheap so I guess it isn't that bad but I feel like it should be possible to make one that is not disposable.
4,good but cheap,"This stepper is great for that part of it but after only minimal uses soon after purchasing it the clip that holds the bnad on snapped and nearly hit my in the eye, so i would recommend buying the one that doesnt have the arm bands"
3,Works nice but not well put together,"I like the workout this stepper gives me and the fact that it's compact. However, the first time I used it, one of the straps broke off. I didn't get it anticipating using the straps, but I thought I'd try them out and for someone who would get it for that reason, I don't think they are that well built."
2,Disappointed,Straps broke after a few weeks of use; attempts to get replacements via customer service -- no response from customer service despite requests through both email and snail-mail. Units squeaks and does not always count steps accurately.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!! VERY NOISY UNTIL THE CABLE BROKE!!,"This stepper worked fine for the first couple of weeks. It became very noisy,the cable broke and it no longer worked. I emailed the manufacturer who sent me a replacement cable. The new cable lasted 1 month. I am waiting to hear back whether they will send another replacement cable. I would never buy a stepper from this company again.BUYER BEWARE!!!"
5,Works Great recomended by my Physcial Therapist,"I bought this about a month after I had knee surgery. I told my physical therapist and he was quite impressed. Of course I had to start off slow. I've used the resistance bands as well, but since they are connected with plastic clips I'm a little cautious with them. At any rate the stepper itself is well made, and is easily used while watching tv."
3,"Excellent, easy to store and use","This is a good product. It is stable, well built, easy to use. The arm bands gives a good workout, when used with the stepper."
4,Good Value,Haven't got my wife to start using it consistently yet but I've tried it myself a couple of times and it's worth the purchase.
1,"Good for a cardio workout, not for toning butt/leggs etc.","I bought this hoping it would give me a good workout like squats or lunges would. It had been a while since I last worked out, and I expected this to be hard. It was very easy to get started, and required no assembly which was great, BUT I worked out on this thing for an hour and a 1/2 and although I was sweating (which means I WAS getting a pretty good cardio workout, my legs/thighs/butt were not burning like I expected them to. When I woke up the next day and my legs were not the least bit sore, I knew I had wasted my money. I wanted to tone up my lower body, and increase muscle mass, and this is NOT the machine for that. I would keep it, except I'd rather go for a jog or brisk walk to get a cardio workout. I wish I could return it, but it has been too long since I bought it. I will probably try selling it."
2,i dont recommend it,"you really do not get in shape with this stepper.dvd work out helps a lot more,this just make your feet heart."
3,A Bit Strange,I find this workout to be a bit weird. The exercises are great but she keeps running the sequence of the workouts. I don't get it.
4,My bunny likes it.,"I use this, along with the Catit Double Diner for my bunny, Zoom-zoom. The 1 Quart bowl is used for his wet foods (veggies & fruits). Fine quality and easy to clean. See my review of the Catit Double Diner for a picture of the Zoomer."
2,Thin and light,"For $12.99, I thought this bowl might be a little more substantial. I've purchased hundreds of things from Amazon (love them) but this one is going back. I found a bigger, heavier stainless dog dish that won't tip for $2 more at a big box store."
2,sticker stupidity!,"I purchased one of these bowls along with the ""ProSelect Stainless Steel Dog Bowl with Rubber Base, 6-1/2-Inch, 30-Ounce"" for my rabbits.It was $1 more than the ProSelect but not any more heavy duty - just shinier...My main complaint is the big sticker on the INSIDE of the bowl that would not peel off; would not soak off in soapy warm water even after days; and after using some goo remover product there is still some residue and I'll have to repeat the process.....before I can trust that it is safe for my bunnies.....I am so sick and tired of all the senseless sticker insanity.I do have to buy some more of these bowls and will be purchasing the ProSelect with the rubber base. I will not buy this product again or recommend it because they ruined it with the nasty sticker...."
5,4qt is perfect size water/food for our Boxer/Mastiff/Pit,"These are perfect for large dogs who like to chew everything up! Our dog is part Boxer, English Mastiff and Pit; he chews and eats everything he can get is paws on... so this completely metal dish is perfect!"
3,"NOT ""Extra Heavy Duty"" as advertised!","I bought several of these stainless steel bowls and was quite disappointed to see that they are NOT ""Extra Heavy Duty,"" but are in fact pretty thin gauge metal. The advertisement is completely misleading and false and the seller should be forced to accurately describe the bowls. I have no idea how long they will last, but I am not hopeful that they will be as durable as the truly heavy duty stainless steel bowls that I have been using for years now."
1,The NOT 3 quart or extra heavy duty dish review,"This dish (made in India for those who care) is way smaller than the listed 3 quarts it claims and is no way at all to be considered heavy duty let alone extra heavy duty. I have other S/S dog dishes that are almost twice as thick as this new one and also the bottom on this new one is so thin that it flexes in and out, with just one fingers worth of pressure, making a boing sound as it does so. I do not recommend this product if you need a true H/D dog dish to last multiple years."
5,Made in the USA,"This is a fun for the whole family low tech game, and made in the USA. It's nicely challenging to the user. Wooden pins...more like an old arcade-type game. Overall a well made toy."
3,Short Changed,"I have to agree with Mr Bassman. Robin Trower definitely should have been included here. This was an excellent movie and as Larry D stated this was a wonderful era of music. One of the finest. Anyone that doesn't own some of the music should absolutely purchase this. These songs are classics, you won't be disappointed!!"
4,Great cd for a Great movie,I love this soundtrack and the movie as well. It's nostalgic mixed with a modern blend. Very inspiring with an old school touch.
3,Should have bought only the top saver,"I wish I would have bought just a bottle of top saver and some steel wool. I don't really need the other stuff, router bit lubricant, blade lubricant, etc.I used the top saver with the included brillo like pad on my table saw. It cleaned the majority of the grime off, but not all. I'm going to try getting some steel wool and trying again."
3,OK but not all necessary,"The pitch remover works great. The table lube is good too. I will definitely buy more pitch remover when I use this up, but I don't need all 5 products. Not worth the price."
5,"Great product....hello, customer service?","I""ve used this product for a long time and love it. When I""m out....I""ll certainly order more."
3,'you must forget the man called Erik',"I liked this book because it combined my two favourite characters: the phantom of the opera (Erik) and Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock stayed the remarkable genius that he is(even though he blundered miserbly sometimes-but,hey,YOU try to do better). But I was really disappointed with the treatment of Erik. Meyer calls him 'the creature' and makes him more insane than even in the original book! Personally, I the most appealling thing about Erik is that he IS a sympathetic character hopelessly in love with Christine Daae. This is why I 'liked' the Canary Trainer, not 'loved' it. (P.S.-Having Gaston Leroux as the music instucter was a creative touch)"
3,Not Meyer's best.,"But it's not as bad as all that. Nevertheless if you want to read Meyer's Holmes pastiches I'd recommend starting with the other two (_The Seven Per Cent Solution_ and _The West End Horror_). Meyer at his best is splendid.If you do so, then be sure to ignore the misinformation in the Kirkus Reviews excerpt above. _The West End Horror_ has nothing to do with Jack the Ripper; it concerns a pair of grisly murders that take place in London's theater district. I assume the reviewer is thinking of Edward Hanna's _The Whitechapel Horrors_."
4,A dissenting opinion,"I've read all three of Nicholas Meyer's Sherlockian pastiches, and oddly enough, this one's my favorite. Yes, it lacks Watson, yes, everyone already knows the story of the Phantom of the Opera, and yes, Meyer stupidly describes a real-life character as dead when he was actually very much alive - but the plot is fast-paced, and Holmes makes a good enough narrator that Watson's absence doesn't hurt as much as it might. Although it has Irene Adler in it, Meyer knows better than to turn the book into a romance. In fact, Holmes' reaction to Adler's presence is nicely ambiguous; while he's clearly attracted/fascinated by ""the woman,"" he just as clearly wishes she'd go away and leave him alone! Get it from the library and see if it appeals to you before you buy it."
2,"A great premise, but a not-so-great story","As a big fan of both Sherlock Holmes and the Phantom of the opera, I eagerly looked forward to reading this book, but found it disappointing. The premise itself is great - the master detective investigating the strange occurrences at the Paris Opera house. However, Holmes makes many uncharacteristic blunders throughout his investigation, and his work is hampered by the fact that he must keep his true identity a secret, since he is believed to be dead at the time. The book also suffers because of the absence of Dr. Watson. The book also shows Christine Daae as an idiot, and the Phantom as an evil maniac with no redeeming qualities.I really enjoyed Nicholas Meyer's previous two Holmes pastiches, ""The Seven-Per-Cent Solution"" and ""The West-End Horror,"" but I don't feel that ""The Canary Trainer"" is as good as its two predecessors. It was a very interesting premise, but I just don't like the way Meyer handled it."
2,The Strange Case of the Opera Ghost,"Meyer continues his version of Sherlock Holmes with a tale of Holmes' lost years after the ""Moriarty Problem."" Holmes becomes a violinist for the Paris Opera and through the intervention of Irene Adler, becomes involved in the strange case of the ""opera ghost."" There are many problems with this novel. Watson's presence is sorely missed and efforts to replace his role with characters from the opera are unsuccessful. Irene Adler's inclusion is an uneccessary distraction and is used soley to comment on Holmes' sexual repression. The case itself is so familiar to the reader that only the inclusion of Holmes changes the basic story, thus there are no surprises.(who doesn't know the basics of Laroux's Phantom?) This was a very disappointing sequel to Meyer's other Holmes' novels and wasn't owrth the wait."
3,Dr. Recommended Product,I have OCD and am on some SSRI's. My doctor recommended that using this as it enhances the effectiveness of the drugs. I think I have seen some effect but nothing major
3,"cool, overpriced flashlight","Neat toy. A thomas flashlight that also has a whistle could make a toddlers day. the construction isn't great, but this is a fun toy"
3,bye-bye bulb,"Bulb fizzled out within a week. Since my son loves this flashlight, I will get him a new one. Perhaps the second one will last longer. FYI- flashlight requires 2 C batteries."
4,Tomas the Tank Engine Flashlight,"Anthing Thomas is great for the grandson. It was billed to me, shipped to him. Easy and very convenient way to sent ""stuff"" to grandkids that live in another state. Thank you for the easy way."
3,Thomas the train flashlight,"My two year old grandson loves this flashlight and even discovered the whistle that you blow into on the opposite end of the light. The ""innards"", however are cheaply made and require a bit of talent to get the batteries in without tearing it up. Outwardly, it is attractive and looks sturdy. Inside is a different story and the first time my grandson screws off the top, it will be broken forever. Maybe I just got a bad one, I don't know."
1,junk,"I bought this flashlight for my toddler who loves Thomas. He fell in love with this flashlight immediately. However his happiness was short lived, since the flashlight stopped working properly after only few hours (and it was not permanently on for hours). The next few days it sometimes worked, sometimes not, till it finally gave in and we could not repair it. By the way, the metal was heating up. The flashlight is a flimsy toy. It feels like we wasted our money, plus we had to watch our disappointed son, who kept trying to make the light work and could not understand why we can't fix his new toy."
4,Good not Great,"I ordered this flashlight for my train-loving son. He likes it quite a bit. I don't think it's overly durable but overall, I'm glad I made the purchase."
1,Do not buy this flashlight,I bought two of these flashlights for my Thomas Train obsessed grandsons. This is the epitome of the worst that China has to offer. Cheap cheap cheap. One grandson will be an engineer when he grows up. He always takes apart any thing we give him. He opened this up and put in two batteries and in the process dislodged a piece of the flashlight that was poorly attached. That was the end of the flashlight. No matter how I straightened the piece and fit it back. It would not work. I strongly suggest buying a real flashlight not made in China if that even exists. I had purchased some D cell flashlights from Fry's years ago when they were made in the US and gave both of them one. They love shining the light on everything. They are both 3 and a half and need night lights for the demons that come in the night and with the flashlights they are OK.Find a good one not this trash.Amazon take this off your SITE. Shame!
2,Broke right away,"This worked for about a week, then it broke. The whistle is an outside only ""loud"" whistle, and still works, but the flashlight went out in a week. we tried to replace the bulb, and batteries but nothing worked."
2,Thomas Tin Flashlight,This flashlight seems very chintzy in comparison to others on the market. I wish I would have read the reviews prior to purchasing.
3,Just an OK flashlight,"I bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas -- and it already broke. He used it a lot during the first month of having it, so maybe that had something to do with it. It's currently a decoration in his room, since he doesn't want to part with it."
1,FLIMSY,"My 3 year old loved it. Sadly, we resorted to taping it together after about a week. No thread for the light/cap, so no way for it to stay together except tape."
1,Flimsy light,"Our son who is a HUGE Thomas the Train fan was looking forward to his flashlight. Thank goodness that we didn't give it to him until we tested the light. It did not function at all. Not even with new batteries. I looked over the light and understood why it wasn't functioning. I built poorly. We would not recommend this item to anyone. If anyone knows of a product similar to this but better built, please let us know."
3,Not as bad as the other reviewers make it seem.,"Wow. I'm certainly glad I didn't read these other reviews before I read this book. I don't agree with them at all. Grant was a closet bisexual (fact). He was abusive to some of the woman in his life (fact). He was a tyrant on the film set at times (fact). It's all here. He was not a nice man at times (fact). But he was a spy for the allies during the war and he knew who could be trusted and who couldn't. You meet his friends, his lovers (of both sexes) and you see the real man. I'm more saddened to learn that he hated making The Bishops Wife, my favorite Christmas movie of all time. I don't think less of the man after finding out some of his secrets, I feel sad that he was so unhappy for most of his life. He gave me so much joy in his movies, it's sad to note that he took almost no joy from making them."
1,Terrible Book!,"I didn't learn a thing about Cary Grant by reading this ""biography"". It is nothing but tabloid trash; overly focused on speculations about Grant's sexuality and possible seedy connections. I was looking for an in-depth and serious book about one of the great screen stars of our time, not a lengthy gossip column. Definitely not recommended."
1,HORRIBLE,"This book was so horrible that I stopped reading it after a few pages. It detailed a false view of Cary Grant. Speculations have always been around of Cary Grant as a homosexual, but no basis for fact has ever arisen, therefore you cannot include such details without their false sense of themselves in the book. The books STINKS and its not worth the paper that it is printed on!"
4,Pretty pin,This is a nicely crafted silver pin with the cubic zirconia adding sparkle in a sophisticated way. I like the red eyes they add a little visual interest.
3,Didn't tell me it was battery powered,"It happens to be a major pain to keep buying batteries, especially since as often as I use hair removers the battery would rot before it ran out of energy. I was looking for something pluggable, not so much portable. On the bright side it did only require one battery, unlike some of the others that needed two. But batteries are starting to raise in price."
1,I wanted to love it. I really did.,"This product sucks. For $30, I would hope that a thermometer would, oh, I don't know...register a temperature. It never did and it never worked for me even after I put a brand new battery in the thing. I thought that maybe the temperature doesn't show up until the sugar mixture hits candy temps. Nope. It just sits there and then turns off. Because I didn't have a thermometer to use and I had to use that stupid cold water method, both batches of candy that I tried to use this on were totally ruined. I only give this one star because you can't give it zero stars. Completely and totally and thoroughly disappointed."
1,Maverick CT-03 Digital Oil & Candy Thermomter,I use this Thermometer for my fry chicken wings and pork chop. It is accurate but DEAD after one year....
2,Digital Oil and Candy Thermometer,"I love this item, but after using it for 3 weeks, it stopped working. The temperature keeps going down on it, instead of going up for candy making. I waited a long time to buy it, and now I'm not very happy with it. Like I said, it worked for a while, but it does not like being used over and over..."
2,NOT DEPENDABLE,"I have to agree with one of the other reviewers. The ther. worked greated for 4-5 times,then suddenly stopped. Even w/brand new batteries, it is not reliable and/or dependable. When you are making candy and sauces which require a precise temperature, you can't count on this one."
2,Cannot monitor cooling for fudge & fondants,"If you're making fondant creams or fudge, which require cooling to 110 degrees F before stirring, this thermometer is USELESS. Per product instructions, ""The unit turns off after 3.5 minutes if no buttons are pushed and temperature is below 130 degrees F"". So how do you monitor the temperature as it cools below 130 degrees? By continually pressing the ""on"" button every 3.5 minutes, which is senseless and VERY inconvenient. Any company that knows the slightest thing about candy making knows that many candies need to cool to 110 degrees F before stirring. Producing a ""candy"" thermometer that shuts off below 130 degrees F is just plain stupid. You also cannot use this thermometer to temper chocolate because a range of 88 degrees F to 110 degrees F is required for chocolate tempering. Final note: thermometer is a bit top-heavy and tends to fall sideways."
2,very annoyed!,"I bought this thermomter after watching Goods Eats with Alton Brown, because when I make buttercream frosting I wanted to be able to clip on the thermometer to the pot and get an accurate reading. Well this themometer did a lousy job at staying clipped onto the pot, it kept falling off no matter how I put it on. I even tried using other pots, but no luck. I am so mad that I paid so much money for this crappy gadget, it sucks!"
1,Worked well one time,"I bought this thermometer after watching Good Eats with Alton Brown in time for my Christmas candy making. It registered the temp. accurately one time only. The subsequent times I used it, the temp was very inaccurate and I had to forget the thermometer and had to test my candy to hard ball the old-fashioned way....putting some in cold water to test the crack stage!"
4,Didigital candy thermometer,This is one of the best candy thermometers there are on the market. We are bery pleased with it as we have been with everything prchased through Amaazon.com
1,I've Given Up,"This thermometer is difficult to use and more importantly I feel it could be dangerous. I've only used it a few times, but each time I've used it I've had trouble getting it to sit securely on the side of my saucepan. When I used it to make caramels recently it actually fell off the pot while I was stirring hot caramel sauce. Not good...I'm going to replace it for one that has a probe."
1,I've had two of these fail in short order.,"This unit works well for a few days or weeks- then it fails. I've had two of these fail now, neither lasted more than a few weeks of use. They work great when they work, but I think they are poorly made."
1,If only it worked,"It sure looked like it would be a good choice for my use (making maple syrup). However, when it failed after one day of use, and left me with sap cooking and no means of determining the correct end point, that was more than inconvenient (maple sap is a perishable item - you can't just set it aside until next week)."
1,The worst product ever,"This product didn't even work once.Unless you turn it on before putting in the pot, it will not read the temperature. Once it's in the pot it won't read the temperature correctly. I know this because I put two standard thermometers in the pot to check the temperature and the digital was off by 50 degrees.I do not recommend this product,"
1,One VERY BIG FLAW,"This unit was well built in every way except one. Their large display is so dark you can barely see it. Plus the specialized settings below are so tiny, even on this big screen, you almost need a magnifying glass to see them.Being a tech guy (at heart and trade) this was very disappointing; my neighbors kid could have designed a better layout and would not have looked at it twice due to the poor visibility quality of the screen.Its a shame, the rest of the device was very rugged and seemed to be very well built with a nice tilt top. I almost kept it for all the other reasons they were that good.BUT, then I remember why I bought it...to be able to READ the temperature. ;)I returned it for a refund."
4,Good for hard candy but not chocolate,"This is a nice thermometer with a handy clip for keeping it attached to a bowl or pan. I like the heat shield, as well, so steam does not skew the reading. However, I bought it for tempering chocolate, and it doesn't have a setting that low - it's designed for temperatures over 100 F. I could still use it for tempering, but it shut off periodically based on a timeout because of the lower temperatures and I had to keep turning it back on. It did give an accurate reading to allow me to temper the chocolate correctly, but having to keep turning it back on was a drawback."
3,"Works For Me, But Not Intuitive","I like this thermometer. It's presets cover about everything you'll ever need. I like the way it swivels and tilts. It fits securely onto pots. The audible alert works great.Perhaps I don't use it enough because I find it taxing to set one of the presets without the instructions. I usually turn it on and manually monitor the temperature.I've had the thermometer for years and I've had no problems with performance. I recommend this over analog. If you are doing basic candy making and frying, this will work well for you. If you want to be able to set your own presets, this is not the unit for you."
1,Worked exactly twice,"Worked twice. The third time I tried to use it, I discovered (too late) that it was reading 30 degrees below the actual temperature and burned the sugar syrup I was making. Meh.While it was working, I liked how readable it was and I liked the alarm, which meant you could leave the stove and wash up or whatever while your candy is boiling, since many candies shouldn't be stirred after reaching the boiling point. However if it's not working, the alarm doesn't do you any good, and you don't know anything's amiss until you smell burning sugar...Didn't like that there was no ""off"" button, but rather an auto-off after three minutes below I think 130 degrees. Not great if you're waiting for something to cool.It also clipped nicely to the pan, for whatever that's worth.Not recommended."
1,I am so glad i saved the packing for thermometer!,"The beeper/flasher did not work. I could have lived with that as I stay at the stove when I fry foods, but, it would have been convenient. However, there were so many things wrong with the design of the product as stated in other reviews that I could not keep it. The silver guard serves no purpose and is too hard to open and close anyway. The digital read out is way too hard to read, not enough contrast. The tiny letters on the pre-sets, impossible to read! I was cooking vegetables but my recipe called for a different temperature than the pre-sets for vegetables, so they are useless. I feel like whoever designed this had never deep fried anything so had no idea what was required,I was really surprised at all of the good reviews.Bad purchase for me. Also, the plastic on the tip was so hard to get off that I thought that is was suppose to stay on, not so."
5,Best candy thermometer,Had to have one of these for our motorhome and left the other at home. Love this thermometer for candies...very accurate and easy to use.
3,not bad,For the price this is a handy little tool. I don't use the specific alarms for candy stages etc. because I am a very attentive cook. The one thing I will mention is that it does slide sideways very easily if you bump it. Perhaps a wider clip would solve this problem.Overall it gets the job done. I have fried with it and made candy with it many times.I would buy this again.
3,Kept shutting off,"I was using it to monitor the temperature of fondant for making chocolate covered cherries. You have to dip the cherries into the melted fondant and the temp has to stay around 100 degrees. I don't know if it was because the temp was so low but the unit kept on shutting off after about 5 minutes of use and I had to keep turning it back on. When it was working I liked having the digital readout because those analog thermometers are so subjective. One look and you know the exact temperature. If you look at the analogs from the side it looks different than looking at it from the top or the other side. And of course, as my byline says, I do ""love my gadgets"" so I will keep it and see how it works with something else."
1,wont last,worked great for the first few times then started to misread temps then just lines on the read out - too expensive for 10 uses - don't waste your money.
2,Does not work with induction cooktops,"After much research to try to find a good deep fry thermometer, I basically concluded there was no such product on the market. I thought I found an ""adequate"" one and bought the Maverick. Unfortunately, apparently nobody who has written a review attempted to use it with an induction cooktop or didn't correlate the unit's malfunction with the induction technology.An induction stove causes this device to completely fail (it beeps constantly and thinks you're pressing the select button when you're not, causing the preset temperatiure to constantly change).Besides this problem, the device won't measure shallow oil (neither will any other thermometer that I read about. It's also fairly unstable despite the well designed clip. I also think the metal cover is annoying and unnecessary.I'm going to go back and replace the cheap glass one that I broke."
2,Not long lasting,Bought thermometer a year ago to make home made fudge and it worked great! a year later tried it again and could not get any temperature readings. and yes i changed the batteries.
3,Works but is broken,"When it was working it is a great appliance, but now even with fresh batteries is is not working, my cheap watch lasted longer."
4,Another winner,Outside Chance is another winner from Louisa Dixon. I read it in practically one sitting. I'm looking forward to her third book
2,Disappointed!,"I planned to order several more of these containers, but I was disappointed in the poor quality. Not at all what we used to get from a Rubbermaid product, sad to say. The edges of the top were sharp and jagged, almost cut my hand. I had to file them to get them smooth enough to be safe for using. I also had a hard time removing one of the product stickers on the clear side of container. Finally had to use peanut butter to remove ""most"" of the sticker and residue. I will try a different product in hopes of finding a container more suitable for my storage needs."
3,shallow,You could write much more extensive book about gouramies and bettas easily. I would have wanted to see much more pictures and more specific information about species. This book isn't bad but it could be much better too.
3,Not enough,It is concise which is fine and in the beginning has general information that applies not only to Gouramies. Then it describes the various species but there is not enough data about the behavior of each of the species and also not enough information on how to breed.
4,Great book,"Received book to all the way to New Zealand in under a week so great delivery!Book was great! As a girl who's got scoliosis, it captured the scoli-essence well and was written very goodly:)"
5,Been there...,"I read this book very recently, and absolutely loved it! :) I wore a Milwaukee brace 23/7 from 4th grade through 7th grade, and now I have a Providence bending brace. Even though I never wore (yet) a Boston Brace, I could totally relate to this book! She wrote this book with such accuracy that only a true scoli kid could write with, and this book is so great for us (meaning scoli kids) to have our friends read. I'm extremely appreciative to finally have a book about scoliosis that isn't just informative, and actually comes from a former brace wearer! Thanks for writing it... and to those who haven't read it- you should!"
5,Best Stevia on the market,"I love this stevia, it works wonderfully and a little bit goes a long way. Best tasting stevia, not bitter. Works well for any cream desert or pie, you can make sugar free hot cocoa with it, or sweeten smoothies or protein shakes without any added calories. This product has helped me cut out most sugar from my diet, without missing out on a delicious sweet treat. My whole family loves it. In baked items, I recommend using some natural sugar for body and texture, but you can cut down on the total sugar by using a bit of stevia. Be careful though, 1/8 of a tsp will sweeten a whole gallon if iced tea!"
5,Uptown Groove INDEED!,"Soundscape UK's Uptown Groove hits the chords. I just received my copy along with 7 other titles by different bands, and Uptown Groove is definitely kickin' it. Gota's on it too and whatta tag-team. The entire album is 'sublime'. A fantastic voyage indeed for those who wish to chill on a cocktail, all alone or with your significant other in a highrise apartment right in the heart of any urban jungle. Highly recommended!"
1,"Mythical Theory, not geophysics","A masterwork of misleading confusion of ancient myth and misunderstood science to create a modern myth.For example, Alvis use one radioactive decay chain of the isotope Potassium 40 of which 11% decays to Argon and his mythical billion ton hydrogen bomb to ""prove"" that radioactive decay time measurement is wrong. But, in the same breath, Alvis ignores the 89% decay route to Calcium which validates radioactive decay dating.Avoid it."
4,EXCELLENT for the price,"Arrived very quickly in perfect condition. I was installing a Mazda original tail light and this one at the same time, and I could not tell the difference (I can't speak to longevity issues, but my car is 10 years old, so price is my main concern). The only issue I had was that the plug was tight compared with the Mazda version. But I was able to get it connected with some extra effort. Very pleased with this product."
3,"Even by ""Smooth Jazz"" standards, this one is listless...","Unfortunately, this jazz experiment is so mellow, so Kenny-G, David Sandborn-inspired that the overall effect is narcolepsy. About as distinctive as a slice of Wonder bread, the one saving grace is the track ""Curved Sky,"" which is so hauntingly beautiful, you wonder what the rest of the CD could have been. I gave it 3 stars on the basis of that song alone."
3,Cute but drippy...,"While this tea pot is a beautiful cobalt color, when pouring tea the spout does not maintain a continuous stream...hence it ""leaks"" onto the side of the pot (and elsewhere). It doesn't all hit the cup unless one is very careful. Poor design but a lovely little pot."
2,Le Disappointment,"I purchased one of these from a local vendor some time ago and ended up not using it much because it drips and dribbles big time when pouring. It takes practice to get this thing to pour without dripping, but it's never easy even so, and the big splash cannot be entirely avoided. The spout simply needs a redesign.It's a shame because otherwise this teapot has a lot going for it. It's very nicely made, it keeps tea warm for a long time (comparing favorably with some cast iron teapots/tetsubin), and if you can't get along with the infuser, there are superior ones which fit this teapot beautifully. I gave this teapot away, after replacing it with a similarly sized one that behaves itself while filling cups. I recommend passing on this one, there are many better performing teapots to choose from."
2,"Like everyone says, pouring is a mess.","I love how this looks, love it's heavy weight and how it keeps tea hot (especially with a cosy) for a long time. Le Creuset makes very fine kitchenware, so I was surprised and disappointed to find this pot pours SO badly. It gurgles and drips (a lot) all over if you pour quickly. If you pour slowly it leaks and drips all over. Much as I love it for many reasons (including its lovely simplicity of style- I have the white), I almost never use it because it takes so much effort to not make a huge mess."
2,Pass. More ends up spilled than in your cup.,"Received this as a gift and wish I had just returned it. It dribbles horribly. I read everyone's ""you're not pouring it right"" advice, and no, it just plain sucks. Either tea dribbles all down the spout and not in your cup, or in attempting to ""get the right arc"" as one commenter put it, tea dumps out the lid and spout simultaneously--don't even think of filling it more than half way. There is no in-between, you just end up with a mess. The only thing going for it is its cuteness and its keep-warmness, but those fade quickly as you are busy wiping up spills and not relaxing with your cuppa tea."
1,Poorly packaged,"The company/manufacturer Le Creuset does not package this product very well. When I received this product the first time, the knob was broken off the lid. Only a thin piece of cardboard was used to protect the teapot inside the box. I requested a replacement and received a replacement teapot with the same damage. I have requested a refund and do not intend on purchasing products from this company again.N.B.: Amazon's packaging was secure; it was the packaging inside the box that contained the teapot that was poor."
5,The definitive way to learn a language while you commute,"I have tried other tapes (10 years ago, anyway) and found that they all required books, or live lessons, or were just rote phrases. But this is a GREAT way of learning a language. You can convince yourself of this by looking at the high resale price of used copies on eBay.Anyway, all you do is listen and speak. Each tape is a half an hour. They are consistently good and easy to progress. Occasionally, they throw in a stinker tape (Lesson 24) but usually, they're really good about challenging you without making it impossible.I'd recommend listening to them at least twice. I personally listen to each side of each tape a total of 3 times.If you have a 30 minute commute, they are perfect. I listen to them on the way to work every day and have progressed to midway through level 3. I'm obviously not fluent in Spanish, but at least now I can understand some of Univision (as long as they're showing chiquitas in bikinis)."
2,"Expensive, Bad Focus and CD Quality!","My problem with this CD course is the level of appropriatecommunicative ability one has after using the course to deal with everyday situations.I believe that the focus of the program is to teach you certain vocabulary which is repeated ad nauseum and then, when you are bored to tears, abruptly ends. It is then you realize that the high price you paid was not worth the money.The CD quality seems poor to me. I would think that for the price of the course one would receive a better quality CD set and recordings."
5,Handbook of Research in Second Language Teaching and Learning,Incredibly useful! Exactly what I need all in one place!
3,Bear's Guide to the Best MBAs By Distance Learning,"Obviously you are looking to expand you knowledge and would like to earn your MBA from home or work. This book does a good job of listing numerous Colleges and Universities around the globe (mostly in the US) that offer an on-line MBA. The book has a standard format for each school providing requirements, costs and an overview of the programs. The main downside is that on some of the programs, they do not provide all of the information. That was frustrating. However, there is information where additional information may be obtained directly from the schools. The Bottom Line: I would purchase this book again."
2,Rembrandt=R.E.M.,"I didn't finish ""...The Master"" because it was so-o boring, thus the title R.E.M. I am not sure if it was because of the production or just Rembrandt's biography in itself. He made a great deal of money, lived above his means and went broke. His first wife had died, and he later 're-coupled'. However, he wouldn't marry his mistress as he had committment issues: He didn't want to share his money. Ahhh...no inspiration there. Further, the man painted too many self-portraits to keep me awake. This is in great contrast to the story of Michelangelo, who was truly ""Divine""."
3,Not impressed,"I bought these sheets based on the above reviews and I am not impressed. I didn't expect a whole lot since I was shopping for sheets from Target, but they aren't very soft and they get very wrinkled (even though I take them out of the dryer right away)."
5,Good stepper,It's perfectly sized and compact that I can easily store it under my bed.I really like this stepper. It's not too heavy.
4,Well satisfied,"This stepper is well worth the money, and after shopping locally, I find this item to be very well made and sturdy. I don't find it to be as compact when folded as I had hoped, but realize that to make it more compact would require sacrificing some of the sturdiness so we leave it up most of the time. And of course leaving it up is a constant reminder to use it, which after all, is the reason for having it. I would definitely recommend this stepper to anyone."
2,computer keeps breaking down,"I bought this stepper in July after months of searching...I thought it was a good price and the right size for my living room. I worked out regularly on it for about a month and then the computer (meter) started acting funny. It would reset itself randomly so that I could not keep track of how long I'd been on, calories burned, etc. I emailed the manufacturer and they sent me a new meter immediately. It worked for a few weeks then died, too. I emailed them again and received two new meters which were even worse--did not even function for a day! I emailed the company again over 2 weeks ago and have not heard how they are going to help?? I love the machine itself, the tension is great, the angle is great (my feet do not go to sleep), but without the computer working, I can't judge what kind of workout I've had because I can't get any data. Very frustrating!"
2,Shocks have worn out twice,"In general the stepper is good as long as you don't care about the shocks breaking every six months! I have had to replace mine twice. The first time they sent the wrong shocks, then the ones that they sent me were already worn out. The second time they once again sent me the wrong shocks and then I had to wait a month for replacements from China. I only weigh 100 pounds so weight has nothing to do with it. The simple fact is that the shocks are low quality. If they made better quality shocks then the product would be satisfactory. If you are not going to use it much, then go for it. I use it every day but I was hoping it would last longer than six months before I had to replace the shocks!"
5,"Great product, great price, great workout","I've used this stepper about 20 times and it's working very well for me. I have strengthened my legs and lost over 10 pounds. It was easy to assemble and is very sturdy, even for someone my size (200+ pounds). I highly recommend it for aerobic workouts, as it is low-impact, fairly quiet, and effective. One problem: the electronic counter seems to reset itself, for no apparent reason."
1,Broke after less than 2 months!,"I agree with the other reviews that it was good while it lasted... I weigh 130 lbs so I'm well below the weight limit and it still broke! I use it on the more high impact/fast level and the metal gets very hot, I heard a snap and the metal on the front basically broke where it was welded on both sides! This was after about 25 minutes of use. I'm going to try and patch the cracks w/ epoxy and see what happens.I don't recommend using this on fast setting for more than short periods of time no matter what you weigh. I doesn't hold up and was cheaply made."
2,Only buy a stepper with electronic display,"I researched for the best folding stepper and came upon this. I was so excited and it arrived within 5 days from placing first order. It didn't work at all, so I had to get a replacement. The second one came within 1 day and the counting device didn't work at all, but the stepper worked. It didn't seem reasonable or accommodating to replace it again. Seem like it would have given me a good workout, but it is not the best out there, even at this price that is a lie! I am sooooooooooo disappointed, had to request for a refund. Rating the equipment 2 stars because I didn't need to put it together...Amazon Customer Service 5 stars. My advice BUY a stepper with an ELECTRONIC DISPLAY ONLY not a plug in one it's too much of a hassle."
3,"Good stepper, but with a few problems","Pros:-Pretty good workout-Light weight, easy to move-Easy to assemble-ConvenientCons:-Developed a squeaking noise after the first few uses. Stamina suggested white lithium spray lubricant, which helps a little, but hasn't solved the problem.-After about a month the display on electronic step counter/timer started malfunctioning.-Even folded, its still pretty big. Don't expect it to fit under the bed."
1,no replacement parts for my older model,The piston for my Stamina Stepper 7509-06 model failed. The company told me that they no longer provide replacement parts. Be warned that you may get stuck when the company switches to new models and stops stocking the parts for the older model!!!
4,Folding Stepper,The item was as advertised. Assembly was straightforward. I consider the purchase a good value.
2,Harder than the gym stepper,"I like to work out but this one is tough on me. I agree it will take me working out for just 5 minutes, than a little more until I am used to this. It is a hard work out. It has made me appreciate the gym machine more. I really should store it under the bed."
4,Use WD40 on this machine,"I like this machine although I noticed how hard it was to operate even at the lowest/easiest setting. I figured I was just really out of shape! After a couple of months, it started to squeak a little. I sprayed it with lubricating spray WD40. Now it operates much more fluidly! Just a tip."
1,Cheaply made product,I purchaed this stepper and shortly after the the shocks broke. I have contacted Stamina products a couple times for replacement parts and they don't stock then and said sorry and it would be months before they can do anything. I would not buy from Stamina products again.
1,Not worth it,"Please don't buy this product, as they say you truly get what you pay for, this product broke down after 1 week of use and not heavy use either and also I am not a heavy person either. Customer support is non existant so don't bother trying. Dont' waste your money on this one."
3,mixed bag,"I had an older version of this model - this newer one is much better constructed and easier to put together. One hint is that a ""little"" liquid soap is NOT enough to get the grips on the handle bars. Be generous with the soap or they won't go on. The major difference other then quality of construction is the angle of the step pedals. The older models were flat to the floor and did not cause me any back (lower/hip)issues. The newer model has steps more suitable for an eliptical device with a pronounced downward slope. This pitches you forward toward the bars and puts the lower back, specifically the hips, under more stress then reasonable and has resulted in several trips to the chiropractor to get reset. I am looking for a way to change the slope as the older model did not do this. Other then that issue, this is a better model. Oh, and the older model made it easier to adjust the point where a step is counted, much more difficult with the newer model. I just count them myself now."
4,Easy stamina,"Product is good. Great price and very convenient. Doesn'T fit under my bed like I had hoped for, but easy enough to store in closet when not in use. I get a good workout from it"
5,Good workout at a reasonable price,"Many retailers both on-line and brick-and-morter sell this same stepper. This version on Amazon was the best priced. The utit itself is good, though I had to replace a few bolts that broke on first use. A few cents spent at Home Depot and the stepper has been fine ever since."
2,It was good for a week until it broke,"This machine may be alright for a light or petit person, but it could not hold up to my weight of 180 pounds. I used it for one week and then the bar that supports the resistant shocks broke."
3,"Cheap, gives you a workout","I will start by saying that the product arrived broke. I was still able to put it together as the part that is broken is the part that allows you to screw it in to base and also unscrew to unfold. I can't do that anymore.I bought this thinking that if I get a year use out of it, it is cheaper than a gym. I just wanted something to give me a cardio workout to help lose the last five pounds before my wedding.My legs are killing me after a ten minute workout.Consider the price and the use. For the price, it may be worth it."
3,Good space saver but ok quality,It's good for a beginner or light workout but the cylinders get hot and degrade over time. It's good what you buy it for but if you use it a lot you will have to buy one every 6 months due to the cylinders going bad.
4,a good buy,I really enjoy this Stamina SpaceMate folding stepper. It took me only 15 mn to mount the equipment et it was really easy. It is a good thing to have it if the weather outside does not allow you to go out or enjoy the outdoor sports.
3,"Noisy, but works most of the time","I bought this stepper in hopes that it would be sturdier and last longer than other mini-steppers that I had purchased before. I guess it's true what they say, you get what you pay for. After only a few uses, this stepper started squeking really bad and after working out for more than 20 minutes, it starts to lose a lot of performance. Basically, this is the same issues I dealt with with every other mini-stepper I have tried that costs less than $100. Since it is bulkier than other mini-steppers, not sure that I'd purchase this product again. I like the smaller steppers better since the don't take up much room."
2,Not worth the money,"The only positive is that this stepper is portable. That said, it never worked and the seller never responded to my request for help. It is too fragile and the hydraulics never worked for me."
3,Good for the money,"For the price, I'm happy. I can't afford a club quality machine. This fit the budget and the space. It came almost fully assembled and it provides a decent workout. So far, I'm really happy, no noise and no indication that it won't hold up to regular use. I use it 3-4 times a week. It might not be hard enough for a serious athlete, but the average/moderately fit person should be fine. The readout isn't all that great-you have to make sure the steps go nearly to the floor for it to register anything and unless you use a good heart rate monitor, your calorie counts won't be accurate. I use a cheap kitchen timer and don't worry about the rest."
4,Good For a Year of Steady Use!,"Best of the folding inexpensive portable steppers. If you use it several days a week for 45 minutes or so, expect it to last 9 months to a year at most, the hydraulics will slowly leak and lose pressure, squeaking will begin, etc. Still, for the price and portability, one of the best options."
4,Stamina Spacemate Stepper,"I thought I'd take a shot at a low cost stepper...not much to lose if it didn't work. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived (easy to assemble) and started using it. I used it roughly 4 times a week for 25 minutes each session. Nice cardio workout. The first one I purchased lasted 2 years, which was longer than I thought it would last. I recently ordered a second."
5,exercise equipment,"This product was easy to put together and it does the job, I will say if you have bad knee problems try something else, but this product was easy to use, the instructions we simple also."
4,Good Product & Value,"So far, seems to be a good quality product. Very quiet during operation. I did think it had wheels for easy moving but, it does not."
5,Awesome Quality For The Price!,"Thank-you, Amazon, for distributing a compact stepper that carries an awesome ratio of quality to cost. It is easy to set up, and has adjustment settings that should satisfy a wide range of users. It's cool to know that you can email or phone the manufacturer directly for any needed replacement parts. Ordered it online from Canada on a Sunday and it arrived 3 days later on Wednesday - scary fast! THANKS AMAZON!!!"
3,Hayes Vanagon air cooled manuel,Not as good as the Bently Manuel but does a good job explaining the basics.
1,Double check the facts,"For whatever reason Amazon negated my last review. I am not sure why.Anyway. My issue was that in researching this book, and whether to buy or not, I found out the author, per the cover no less of his book, states he is a Ph.D. He doesn't have a recognized Ph.d as the degree is from a diploma mill. This is not opinion, this is fact. I thought the potential reader should know this before purchasing a book by the good ""Dr."".Amazon really should do better about allowing such materials to be sold on their website."
4,New Vitamin bible,The latest edition. I wanted to bring my knowledge up to date compared to my old 1998 edition. Good over view of vitamins and minerals. Some interesting tidbits.Author tends to be conservative in his views; I can agree with some of his advice but not all.
5,Perfect for the Kindle app,This book is perfect for the Kindle...much better than the hard copy. I love that I can search for a vitamin or mineral and find every reference to it in the book in seconds and the word is highlighted so I see it instantly. I've had the original printed copy of this book for many years and am thrilled to now have this updated easy to use digital copy.
5,BEST VITAMIN BOOK,I HAVE USED THIS BOOK FOR MANY YEARS FOR INFORMATION ON VITAMINS. I HAVE READ OTHERS BUT ALWATS TURN TO THIS FOR BEST INFORMATION.
5,happy customer,Excellent product! The funnel covers the whole area it's needed for. It's just what I needed. Very fast shipping too!
5,Flash,"I was at the tattoo place at the beginning of 2006, with my sister. While waiting for her tattoo to be completed, I was browsing thru their sorts of magazines. I ran across a page that showed Hello Kitty tattoo art. I LOVE that one. A few months later I returned to find that art so the artist could do this one on me. Unfortunately that mag is now gone. :(Is there a way that you have old mags still in stock? Could you look it up for me? I think this is the right magazine or it could have been from a different author.Thanks,Judy"
3,gardens,"Video was of running water, flowers, clouds, fish, and bamboo trees. There was no nudes in the video as the right side of the video cover may lead one to believe."
3,Looks Great...works just as good as most though...,"I thought I'd purchase this carafe based on the reviews in hopes that it would keep coffee warmer for a longer period of time but...it doesn't. I sort of was thinking German made like a Mercedes but this isn't going to make the ""million mile club."" It is adorable though. I've filled it with hot tap water and also boiling water and let it sit for 5 minutes before emptying the water and adding the coffee. It keeps the coffee hot for about an hour and then warm for a couple hours but certainly not all day or even more than a couple hours like some reviews said. Not much better than reliable Thermos brand. Again though, if you are into the ""looks of stuff,"" then this is great to look at but in my opinion not worth $70!"
1,Hardly even worth one star,"If you are interested in becoming a falconer, stay away from this book. As a master falconer, and the current secretary and treasurer of the Maine Falconry and Raptor Conservancy, I have no problem referring to this text (if you could call it that) as ""deplorable.""Rowley uses photographs of hawks with unacceptable equipment, and fails to introduce even an ounce of information that is new to the sport. Having read nearly 100 books on the subject, I can honestly say that this was the least useful. Sorry Sam, but if I had been asked to review this book prior to its publication, the task would have been an easy one; and wrapped up with a single word...WORTHLESS"
4,Solid basic falconry manual,"Sam Rowley makes the practice of falconry accessable to the novice. His patient, calm, straightforward explanations of the care and training of a hunting hawk is never condescending to the beginning falconer. In the US, apprentice falconers must be under the guidance of an experienced, sponsoring falconer. When your sponsor is not immediately available, consulting this book is the next best thing. It is not the only falconry manual in print, but since it is written from a US perspective, it is more relevent to American falconry than some of the British books that are available. If you are starting out in the sport, order this book."
5,George Rocks,One of hte few latino actor to lead his own tc series. If you are from Latino background his jokes hit home every single time. I love the show...
5,Good show.,Good show and very funny but they shouuld have released the rest of the series on dvd. overall 5 stars
2,Duplicate Dvd,I received the George Lopez series 1 and 2 dvd's and there were 3 dvd's all together. One was disc 1 and the other two were disc 2. I do not know if there is supossed to be a disc 3 or another disc 2. Other then that it was ok and easy to order. I was happy to find it because I could not find it in any stores in my area. I hope I was not cheated out of some episodes.
4,Fabulous old comedy,"It's a fabulously funny old comedy.Though French, it's has a universal appeal.The only problem is that i failed to see this edition doesn't have English subtitles.Can't seem to find one that does."
2,"Hard to read, wires get caught","I bought two of these several months ago. One is on a freezer in the garage and the other is on our refrigerator. The display is too small to read at a glance, the display unit on the chest freezer in the garage spends much of the time on the floor because there is no place to attach it conveniently. The wires that attach the temperature probes get caught on refrigerator or freezer drawers on the one in the kitchen. I put some tape on the wires to keep them out of the way but these are not well designed. hard to read and wires get caught on moving things. Wireless would be better and larger display would also help. A hundred foot distance from sending to receiving units would be a good thing. I have a wireless thermometer in the back yard that cost about the same as this unit but is much more practical."
1,not worth the money,Did not like the product. It is listed as a refrig. freezer therm. but it only does one or the other and it does not have an audible alarm. Could not get it to work properly. Sent it back. I am very happy with Amazon they refunded my money as well as my shipping fee.
2,Difficult to check temperature,"This thermometer doesn't just show the temp as it should. I was able to get the freezer one to show the temperature, but the refrigerator one kept on saying that the temp was too high. I know that level was in the range, but it wouldn't show the temp."
4,Refrygerator/Freezer Thermometer,"It measures temperature in the freezer or refrigerator, but not both. That is the rub! Since we had purchased it for our freezer, the unit has red/green indicator lights for either the freezer or refrig depending where the probe is placed, it becomes an issue when only a freezer is used. One light will read red, while the other will read green showing OK freezer settings. It does work but you must overlook the slight short coming."
3,Save your User's Guide!!,"Despite its impressive accuracy, and a wow factor up there with Maverick's other 'gee-whiz' instruments, I have found programming refrigerator and freezer setpoints just impossible without the original user's guide. I discovered how non-intuitive this ""must-have gadget"" seems after replacing the batteries (a good 6 months after I actually followed the original guide). What now? Simply leave it alone with its new AAAs and see what happens . . . maybe Maverick put a brain in there."
1,"Utterly awful, pretentious dreck","This album sounds sort of like someone shouting random math equations in a loud, harsh, obnoxious voice. There's some logic to what's being said but it's extremely unpleasant to listen to and what, ultimately, is the point?This is the type of music that is created for both the musician and his few misguided fans to show how original, intellectual and ""advanced"" they are. The two parties form a small, self reinforcing feedback loop. You see, the more painfully pointless, atonal and awful the music is, the ""smarter"" it is. No one with an ounce of sense actually likes listening to it. If you want to clear a room in a hurry, put this on.I bought this CD because I like some of Mahanthappa's work with Vijay Ayer. I'm disinclined to sample any of his other recordings. Ornette Coleman he ain't."
1,Unlistenable. Utterly unlistenable.,"I'm sorry, I tried to give it a fair shake -- in fact, after reading a positive review of Mahanthappa's quartet, I was excited to hear it -- but this is the kind of cacophonous doodlebugging that gives jazz, and jazz saxophonists in particular, a bad name. A painful experience for anyone who enjoys music constructed from rhythm, chords and melody that bear relation to one another. Please, O Muses, save jazz from the random noise brigade."
1,Sour Grapes??,"This book is a clear example of how one scorned chooses to retailiate against his former brethern. Mr. Mehrally is an ex-Ismaili who has been excommunicated from the Ismaili community for over 25 years now. What other Muslims and in this case Mr. Mehrally fails to recognise is that if they are calling themselves muslims and followers of the Quran, they need not critisize other religous practices as stated in the Quran, Allah is the final judge not Mr. Mehrally or other muslims. The only reason I put a star is because it asked me to.This book is baseless, because the fact in this book is distorted by Mr. Mehrally's vendetta and scorn for the Ismaili Community and practises. To Mr. Mehrally and all other muslims who agree with his vendetta I say..""Let one who hasn't sinned cast the first stone"". We as the muslim ummah have better things to do than this. there are brothers in the middle east that need our help and support."
1,Meherally is engaging in historical fiction,"Meherally claims that the Khojas were converted from Sunni Islam to Shiism during the 19th century. He does not explain why Khoja Sunnis traveled to Iran during the 18th century (there are tombstones whose inscriptions were written in the Khoja secret script date 1722) to give their tithes to a Shia Ismaili Imam. He writes off the Khojas own history of being converted by an Ismaili missionary during the 13-14th centuries. He dismisses the results of a courtcase in British India which decided this issue over a hundred years ago. In other words, he is rehashing an old arguement that wasn't convicing then and is not convincing now."
1,Trash,"Not worth buying this book. It is writen from hate, and not the truth. Only those who have a clear understanding of the Ismaili faith will know that what he has Written in his book is completely wrong. The information in the book is very inaccurate. He has purposely left out information to make this great religion in Islam look bad. Keep in mind when he was booted out of the Ismaili religion he then joined the Sunni religion, but when they found out about his hatred towards the Ismailis they through him out.............."
1,A total waste of time and money,"Do not be fooled into spending a single dime on this piece of junk. The author clearly has an agenda of hate against a certain group of muslims. If you want to learn historical facts concerning the Ismailis, numerous better books can be found on this site alone."
1,Disapointing,"The book reads as rather emotional, and bias...so one hardly feels that one can trust the opinion of the Author, a real opertunity losed to place the Ismai'li sect under particular Achdemic scrutiny, for their many religious idiosycracys, the author doesn't seem to be able deatach his emotions, and so the book spirals in to the rantings of a hurt individuel instead of an achdemic work of scholorship, he blatently represents urban legend as faction as in the case of the Historical Background. There has yet to be a book written that is truly independant, and factual...Farhad Daftary is probaily a better bet with the Work he has done with the sect, and Cambridge and oxford universaties, with research into the isma'ili sect."
1,Total Lies.,akberally meherally has not researched his information. He has based view on their history. He has not proven any of his facts in the book.
1,Merally Does not know what he is talking about,"The only reason why I gave this person a star is because they had no negative stars. This person has not studdied the history of the Shia Ismailies yet he is giving us a so called ""History Lesson"". If you sit go through history and think about it H.H The Aga Khan is the direct dessendant of the Prophet Muhammed. Also the fact that if Mr.Merally is a true Muslim he would not go on and brag about it by writting a book a by trashing a sect of his own religon (which the Quran says not to judge other religons). Since he is doing this what is the difference between Mr.Merally and amy other Islamic Extremest. The publishers of this book Obviously do not know the history of Ismailis'.... It is people like Mr.Merally that judges faith and makes Ismailis minorities look like outcasts to the Islamic religion. One day Mr. Merally will realise that he did a mistake by writting this book and he will ask Allah himself for forgivness."
1,HATERS,"this book was a piece, of thrash .all i could see was hatered and jelosy in the authors fasle description of ismailis.the biggest LIE was that we were converted from hindus.nothing but pure muslim"
5,Every reference is confirmable.,"The biggest controversy of our time. Author removes the veil from the history of Aga Khani ismailis. After the publication of this book Aga Khan gave a farman to every single Ismaili paryer hall, not to support the author. Every Ismaili in the world knows about this author and his books and has been instructed not to support the books. A remote village in India or huge metropoliton city in USA, every Ismaili will have negetive feedback about the author and the book. Read it for yourself to see the truth. Every single aspect of the book makes sense if read with an open mind and for the purpose of research. Author gives examples from the work of Ismaili writters that current Imam is not the direct descendeant of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) And ancestors of present Imam either practiced Sunni beliefs or Ithna Ishri practices."
1,Can I give this book a zero?,"I am surprised to see such drivel actually being published. It saddens me that trees had to give up their lives for this mean-spirited work of cruelty. Islam is a religion of tolerance, and this shows none at all."
5,Teaching Our Children,Negotiating a racist social landscape is the prime stumbling block to the success of African-American young people. How do parents equip their children for this daunting task? Dr. Ward's book is a significant tool. It offers concrete strategies for parents and illuminates the struggle with engrossing interviews. Dr. Ward's book should be read by all but her model for resistance should be embraced by anyone affected by racism.
5,putting piazzolla in context,"This is an excellently conceived and performed collection. What makes it especially relevant is that with the current fashion for Piazzolla's work it is often easy to overlook the other composers working in the same genre. Putting Milhaud, Ginastera, and Ponce with him shows both his classical roots and his vernacular idiom."
2,"Skip this game, way too many other good ones","Incredible on how ""professionals"" have not only given this game a pass, but recommend it!!You have to be masochist, drugged induced, mentally ill or at the least in nostalgic denial about this C&C; game to say it doesn't suck. Need to emphasize the total lack of plot, super weapons, or at least the campy videos that at least made the red alert ones charming. Menu as usual takes up too much screen space & I was frustrated because i got bogged down having to click build new units because of the 9 unit limit per building (not young or as patient). n a 2003 game it's ludicrous!! On top of all the negatives the freaking AI blatantly cheats. Need to download the demo for C&C; 4 and hope for better days, thank GOD i borrowed this and DIDN'T actually spend any money on it."
1,Wrong,I requested the whole game and i only got the expansion package. which sucks because i don't have generals. It should have stated that it was just the expansion but it didn't.
1,Old Country Music Lover,"I Received this product in perfect condition and have Really enjoyed it, I think anyone that loves old country music will love this Item."
5,C&O Calendar,"The Blue Bison calendar has been a focal point on my office desk for a number of years now. For me the calendar is a daily reminder of nature's gestures--sometimes simple, often extravagant--and each month as I turn the pages, I consider myself fortunate that the Blue Bison photographers share their seeing with me.Kurt Smith (Photographer)Kingston, Washington"
3,"So far, pretty good","I love how this scale looks - that's a large part of my decision to purchase it. I intend to keep it out all the time on my counter & wanted something really cool & modern. It seems very accurate but I did have 1 problem (& I hope it was just a fluke). I turned it on one day & got an odd ""error"" on the display. I turned it on & off again several times & it didn't clear. Then I removed & reinstalled the battery & that seemed to fix the problem. So I hope that won't happen again. Other than that, I really like this item so far."
3,"It's beauty, BUT","It's a beautiful looking scale. I only wish that was easier to switch between lbs/ounces and grams. With my older digital scale (different brand) there was an easy to access button on the display panel. You simply pressed the button and the unit converted the weight. However, with this unit you have to take the back panel off, take a small screwdriver and move the calibration dial. Not so great if your not the only one that is going to use the scale."
4,"Great scale, but it turns itself off automatically.","This scale is easy to use and measures accurately. I've had this scale for several weeks now and use it for baking/cooking.The only thing I didn't like about this scale is that I was measuring some honey into a bowl. I had the honey in a bowl sitting on the scale while I was trying to calculate my measurement in ounces. When I return to continue where I left off (only a minute) the scale automaticlaly shut off. This caused me to remeasure the honey by emptying the bowl and starting all over...this scale will shut itself off if there is a period of inactivity.Other than that, everything about this scale is perfect. I've been using it for baking and I like the fact that I don't need to use a lot of measuring spoons and measuring cups, leveling, packing, etc. I just weight each ingredient into a large bowl, one ingredient at a time and the same recipe comes out perfect everytime. This method is so much faster and more accurate."
5,Excelent Kithcen Tool - Don't have a kitchen without it.,"I have had my scale for almost 10 years and I LOVE IT! I use it every day. When I have to change from metric to imperial, I remove the cushion on the bottom, slide the level over, replace the cushion and I am ready to go. The finish is clean and it still looks brand new. I have only had to change the battery once in 10 years and it was easy to do. In reading the other comments, you do have to be ready to measure your ingredients when you start as the scale does turn itself off after about 2 minutes of inactivity but that is something quickly overcome once you understand how it works. I consider that feature a battery saver. I have gotten more than my money's worth from this small appliance. They are much less expensive than when I purchased it. Definitely worth the money!!"
3,It looks great,"It is made in China. If it works when you receive it then you may need some help to keep it working. That nice finish is not protected and can be easily scratched or discolored. The instructions are cryptic, at best. My new scale look great but it does not sit flat on the counter top, it wobbles, a bit, and I am sure that this sometimes drives the electronic zero a little nuts at times. I am not sure what this does to the accuracy, but I feel the need to test it. There is nothing that seals the internal electronic circuit from water, etc, just a rubber guard. (I hope it doesn't turn brittle or stiff with time) If you lose it you will be in deep do do. So you must be careful. For this price it should have been made in Sweden, maybe Denmark. It does look great, now I have to remodel my kitchen."
2,Unreliable,"This scale has been irritating almost from day one. It very frequently will refuse to turn on or will display ""Low"" for low battery and immediately turn off - this is despite the fact that the scale was brand new and shouldn't have any issues with the battery being depleted. Perhaps my particular scale has a short circuit somewhere in it, and this won't affect other people's purchases. I like the scale when it is working but unfortunately that isn't very often. I also agree with other posters that the scale can be a tad bit wobbly at times. It is also not convenient to switch from pounds to grams, and if you need to do this frequently it will quickly get on your nerves. Finally, the auto-off feature seems pretty quick at times and if you take too long at measuring something then you will end up having to start all over again. A decent scale when working, but it has been really unreliable for me. I think I'm going to give up and purchase a different model."
5,if you love the Adirondacks...,"you will love this book- the photos are clear and unique, the text is very interesting- lots of historical details"
3,Good workout - not so good diet,"Most of the book talks about the curves diet which is very similar to the south beach diet. I don't like high protein, low carb diets so I didn't follow the diet. I did like the workout though. You have to have a set of exercise bands and a stop watch to do the workout. You do 40 second exercises with the bands and walking/jogging in place between each exercise. You are suppose to be able to do two complete sets of the exercises in 30 minutes. It took me an hour to do the exercises because you have to keep changing the position of the bands. I also found it hard to keep track of when 40 seconds are up."
4,Good extra,This book is a good extra to accompagnie the curves fitness in my club. It adds a lot of good ideas
5,Seeing What's Next: Using Theories of Innovation to Predict Industry Change,"""Seeing What's Next: Using Theories of Innovation to Predict Industry Change "" is a great book on strategy especially for the ones that are not aware of the concepts and cases revealed in ""The Innovator's Dilemma"" and respectively in ""The Innovator's Solution"". It is the right blend of academic insights and mindset, practical advices and flair and cases studies. Even if in hindsight some of the cases will not fare exactly as suggested the decision framework is flexible and innovative enough to be an enhancement to the readers' business acumen. Hovering between trial and error and rules based decision systems, the proposed tools handle well both the disruptive and the sustaining innovations as recipe for growth."
2,Outdated,"Christensen's Innovator's Dilemma is considered an industry standard. I figured Seeing What's Next would be similarly enlightening. Unfortunately, this one is over 8 years old and pretty outdated.A lot of innovation has happened since the book's release (2004) including iPhones (2007) and YouTube (2005). While the book is a great review on how older companies have failed to innovate, many of his innovating/modern examples are now flailing as well, like Dell.While it's important to know your history, it's too distracting to have to evaluate and reposition his ""modern"" examples over and over."
4,Insightful!,"Clayton M. Christensen's first book, 'The Innovator's Dilemma,' was a work of impressive insight and originality. His second, 'The Innovator's Solution,' was somewhat less insightful but added a necessary extension to the first by telling readers how they might begin to extricate themselves from the dilemma of industry disruption caused by an upstart innovation. The current book is a dense, harder to read compilation of the first two books, with added theoretical insights. Christensen and co-authors Scott D. Anthony and Erik A. Roth tell readers how to use theories of innovation to predict change. We applaud the effort. Don't miss the helpful appendix that summarizes the previous two books."
5,Real hip-hop!!!,"Just when I thought real hip-hop was dead, we had that new GZA vs. DJ Muggz CD and that Think Differently CD. Now we got this. For all you'z hip-hop heads, don't sleep on this. This is gonna be some classic stuff. And Planet Asia puts it down. And Architect lays the beats down too."
5,Country Blues,Piano ragtime on the guitar evolved into country blues. These are all fun to play and great tunes.
4,Cute,"This was a gift for my sister in law, a true Cubs fan. She loves them. For the cost, they look good. But I wouldn't spend any more on them..."
5,Love it,"My wife absolutely loves this product! As a Cubs fan, I Love to see here wearing it! Proudly sporting our colors!"
3,VALUABLE AS OUTPUT OF A HIGH GENIUS,"By all accounts Swedenborg was both a high genius and, in his later years, psychic...focused on developing a world view that encompassed heaven and hell, angels etc. As such this book is a collection of many of his remarks about the afterlife and heaven and hell. It has a dated feel in the sense that Swedenborgs views are firmly those of someone writing over 200 years ago...and it is a puzzle how to reconcile them with more ""modern"" writers/travellers on the path. The charitable view would be that, if what Swedenborg says is somehow true, then it is also filtered through the mindset of someone of his era (just as must be true of someone of our own era). This ""dated"" aspect of his ideas greatly reduced their value for me...but some of his ideas (eg about how we create our own heavens and hells) cannot be found elsewhere."
5,A Pleasant Surprise.,"Having been used to Julianne Bairds wonderful performances of Handel and other early composers, I was pleasantly surprised at the range that she shows on this cd. It's a charming performance that will bring a smile."
4,Drip of tension,"In this, the second of the Chronicles of Mavin Manyshaped trilogy, prequel to the True Game trilogy, Mavin is 15 years older and seeks her sister Handbright among the people of the Chasm -- who do not have Talents -- over the sea to the west of the Land of True Game.This is a fun, enjoyable, creative story, with a drip of tension part way through; a worthy addition to those in the series preceding it."
3,Okay book.,I love Sherri Tepper. I found the book interesting and entertaining. It is nothing to rave about but not much to be unhappy about either.
1,Not worth the money,"This book lacks everything that makes a ""good book""; a descent plot, character development, and originallity. At $17.99 for a 121 page book, you get to pay about $.15 per page for a boring and quite predictable ""story"". Ugh! Not at all worth it!"
5,Meat Thermometer,"Worked fine the first time. It was easy to clean, too. Instructions that were included was easy to read, also."
4,Good buy for the money.,Works well and have never had a problem with it. I use it in both the oven and on my grill and smoker. been using it for about 6 months now.
4,electronic thermometer,"nice compact unit, easy to use and program, i really like the long probe cable, i have used it in the oven, on my barbecue, and smoker. the done feature really helps i don;t have to keeping opening doors or lids to check, so things cook faster."
2,Probes are failures,"We owned this thermometer previously and had it for a year with moderate use and the probe stopped working, we elected to buy a new one and after the second use the probe stopped working again. Probe replacements are like 17 buyer be ware. Giving it two stars because it does work well when it does but there is a serious probe issue"
1,Maverick Roast Alert,It may have worked 5 times. It is an absolute piece of garbage. After the first use the probe stopped working. I called Maverick and they sent me another (they did not seem suprised about the non-working probe). It worked several more times and then began to beep and signify that the neat was done after just 30 seconds in the oven. I got frustrated and threw it in the trash.I purchased an additional Pyrex Digital Probe Oven Thermometer/ Timer which I have found to be more reliable and less expensive.Vote of no confidence for Maverick!
3,great for a while,"My son bought this thermometer for me. It was great for a while. I used it on my smoker. I loved the magnet on the back, to help keep me from dropping it. It measured so accurately for maybe a dozen uses and then suddenly in the middle of a cook it registered HI on the cooking temperature and never again came down. I just bought another one I hope it works longer."
1,Avoid like the plague,"I have the Williams-Sonoma version. It worked fine, once, but after that, it was worthless. I threw it away yesterday after I inserted the probe into the meat (which had just come out of the refrigerator) and the alarm started going off and it read overdone."
1,first use and broken,"used this thermometer one time and it says the temp is ""HI"" will not read at all. my window to return has passed and i did not keep the package so i am SOL. Be very careful if you buy this piece of crap, very poor chinese made trash. i am not sure that this product is safe to use around food. stay away if you are smart"
1,Meat Thermometer,"Do not buy this item. It does not work for any type of meat I have tried. The unit immediately, 4 to 10 seconds, goes to overcook alarm. I tried steak, full chicken and brisket.It the meat is large enough to insert the entire probe, it works. Do you cook 8 inch thick steaks?"
2,No Maverick or Polder,I've gone through 4 Polder and Maverick thrmometers of the sort that use probes. All have failed within a month or two. The only brand I've found reliable is CDN.
2,Nice but fragile probes,"Like many other users, the meat thermometer works great. I love the unit except that the probes burn out when used in the intended fashion--namely in a BBQ. I have gone through 4 of these probes within a year. I finally called the mfr (Maverick), and all they could offer me was advice to wrap the wire in aluminum foil to protect the wire against the heat. I will try this one more time, but Maverick's advice is tacit acknowledgment that their probes are not properly designed for their intended environment..."
2,Probe doesn't last long at all,"I bought this in December 07 and it worked just great, you can manually adjust the ""done"" temperature which I did for a turkey at christmas, and it was PERFECT, unfortunately I have only gotten about 6 uses out of it and the probe died. The unit gives me the ""HIGH"" alarm as soon as I plug it. This began on its 4th use and I found that if I moved the wire at the probe I could eventually get it to work and I was able to get 2 more uses out of it. Mind you, I have never submerged the probe to wash it, I cleaned it with a damp sponge, NEVER pulled on the probe wire, never exposed it to temps above 400F and never used it in a barbeque. After reading the reviews here, I thought that handling it with ""kid gloves"" would make it last, I was wrong. The unit should come with several probes to at least get you through enough uses to where you can say ""well, I guess I got my money's worth out of it."
5,bought this 3 years ago!,I got this 3-4 years ago. I LOVE IT.over that time i have forgot it outside for the winter. Came back when the snow melted (was in 4 inches of water) AND IT STILL WORKED!one word of advice. do not have it on the Grill when using it! yeah it has magnets on the back but don't do it. I did..while grilling up a chicken. the darn thing melted. BUT IT STILL WORKS!I love it. but thinking of buying one that is not so beat up and ugly.
5,Meat thermometer,The best & most accurate meat thermemeter I've ever used. Bought 2 to give as gifts.
1,do not buy,I thought this was great the first two times I used the third time it did not work at all!Save your money!
1,second time around,"This is my second unit since I really liked the first. The first, about 2 years old is still going great, but the one I recently purchased has experienced a problem with indicating the temperature. My first call to the manufacturer resulted in a quick response and a new probe. However, that did not solve the problem. After numerous calls and messages, I was told to return the base unit at my expense (grant you this device surely cannot cost the time their customer service has devoted to this, to say nothing of mine)so they could examine it. After 3 weeks, still no response from the manufacturer. Great service, heh?"
2,Not deserve 4 or 5 stars!!!,I bought this racket because of the good reviews and the price. I got it 3 days ago and I played with my friends. The racket is best for beginners or maybe pre-intermediate players. If you're intermediate or more the racket will damage your playing skills and reduce your performances.I can't return it because the company doesn't accept open items.
4,"Great, But can be hurtful","This is a great paddle for some one who knows what they are doing. If you haven't developed your style yet and don't have the control for spin and power, this isn't the paddle for you. The smashes are fast and the spin is great, but I noticed that without spin it is very hard to keep it on the table because of the speed. It can be used defensively, which I am suprised at because it is an offensive paddle. This paddle is not for beginners, or even players who are just starting spin. Work on ball placement before getting this paddle or you won't be able to keep it on the table."
4,"Terrific Racket, Good Price","I received this racket yesterday in the mail, and I immediately fell in love with it. It's interesting that the first reviewer found this to be a lighter racket compared to the Carlos Chiu, for I found the Senshu to be heavier. In any event, I consider this racket to be the big brother to the Chiu. It's definitely for the offensive player, for it's wicked fast that produces killer slams. Getting use to it for defensive play will take some time, but once you do, you have one terrific racket and a very good price. Offensive players, give this racket a test run."
5,Versatile arrow case. Good value for money.,This arrow case is of excellent quality. Holds 18 arrows and about 1 dozen broadheads. Highly recommended.
4,23 Watt is pretty low.,100 Watt replacement is supposed t/b 23 to 28 Watt. I would rather use the 27 Watt to get a little brighter light. I used two 23 Watt CFL bulbs in the ceiling fixture of the study and it lit the entire room (very much like sunlight). I guess it takes some trial and error to get the exact wattage for the purpose.
4,Great pizzelle maker!,"I've had this iron for several weeks and am very happy with it. The iron heats quickly and makes crisp pizzelle. Despite the manufacturer's claim that you do not need to oil the cooking surface, I've had to add a bit of oil to the top and bottom plates prior to cooking the pizzelle to prevent sticking. Other than that, it is a good iron for the money."
5,"Michael J. Zvolensky, Ph.D., Associate Professor, Director, Anxiety and Health Research Laboratory, University of Vermont","This text is an important, timely, and significant work on the role of acceptance in anxiety and its disorders. This book is an excellent resource for clinicians, graduate students in training, undergraduates in advanced therapy or clinical/counseling courses, and anxiety researchers interested in acceptance and mindfulness factors. It will surely become an important guide and reference for many years to come, and stimulate further work in this important domain of study.Michael J. Zvolensky, Ph.D.Associate ProfessorDirector, Anxiety and Health Research LaboratoryUniversity of Vermont."
5,"Challenging new approach, worth reading",Startling new way to treat anxiety disorders from a humanistic view aimed at creating a meaningful life despite high anxiety. The book is written very clearly and contains techniques such as metaphors and stories that are excellent and can be used with more traditional therapy.To use ACT alone in therapy to treat anxiety disorders by just reading the clear instructions of the book and using the CD that comes with it may be dangerous. It is a counter intuitive approach that must be consistantly maintained; the therapist must be 100% present at all times. It is not just a technique that can be applied; the therapist must model this approach in real life or he/she could cause more harm than good. I would love to attend in person some training in this approach and have some live supervision (as is required for EMDR therapy). Definitly worth reading and staying in touch with any new research in this approach.
5,exciting behavioral treatment,I used this book to create a hypothetical treatment plan for an anxiety disorder for my developmental behavior class. The book was very thorough and practical.
1,What the H***??????,"Don't buy this unless you want a real good laugh (both at yourself for buying it and at the people who made it). This movie gives new meaning to the phrase ""low-budget horror flick""."
1,Terrible!!!!!!,"Terrible acting, terrible direction, NO STORY!!! - Some of the worst effects ever. Don't trust other reviews, the other reviews are by the people who made the movie."
3,Closed End Funds,"Good information in this book, but feel it could have been much more concisely written. Volume it approximately 500 pages. Could have been presented in 100 pages or less."
5,Wonderful!,"This book has excellent blends, and very helpful information on how to make the pillows themselves, what herbs to use and some great blends. Buy this book, get a better night's sleep and have pleasant dreams!"
3,Christmas gift,"My wife (who is an avid dreamer) seemed to like this gift when she opened the package, but she hasn't really looked at it much since then. She found the concept interesting. It would be a good gift for someone who has time to follow some of the recipes and time to sleep!"
3,"Not bad, not great","The recipes for making herbal pillows are good. However, the book only gives you one instruction for sewing a pillow. I guess I was hoping for more than one style."
2,got herbs?,Making Herbal Dream Pillows : Secret Blends for Pleasant Dreams (The Spirit of Aromatherapy)This book is a fanciful imaginative simple addition to an herb library containing recipes for pillow sachet blends with a back page herb resources list which may not be entirely current as it is copyrighted 1998.
3,Alright,"This book does have some nice recipes. I have seen some better sources with many more recipes as well as ways of actually making the pillows themselves, I also didn't like the fact that in the book it was recommended to NOT use essential oil, I dissagree & many others do as well."
5,A MUST Have,"At first, I was apprehensive about trying out this duo because I have very porcelain skin and thought it might be too dark or clownish looking. I was pleasantly surprised how the color looked so natural on my skin. Laguna is an excellent shade of bronzer and is also great for contouring. Orgasm pairs beautifully with laguna and is probably the best blush I've ever used. It gives a radiant glow and touch of color without being too overdone. This is definetly a must-have product, one that I can't imagine being without now. Well worth the money and love the free shipping!"
4,Bronzer,I do reach for this often-it complements many skin types-and high quality NARS makeup for the loyal fans-it does contain minute amounts of sparkle for those that need to be aware of this (those of us over 40)- so I usually wear it for indoor use or nighttime events. I used it once on a sunny day and I was glittering!
3,NARS Bronzing Blush Duo,"Love NARS Orgasm blush & have been using it since discovering it several years ago. The bronzer in this duo is a little too brown for my skintone. I'll stick with Neutrogena's Healthy Skin Custom Glow Blush & Bronzer in Natural Glow, and then top off with a light dusting of NARS' Orgasm. NARS' Orgasm really is the most beatiful blush on the market...& works perfectly with every skintone."
5,Love it!,"Even though the make up arrived broken as soon as I notified them everything was taken care of on the same day, such a great shopping experience and they care about their customers! Thank you guys so much I love my make up! It looks fantastic on :) I'm very pleased!!!"
2,Dont Waste your time or Money!,"This is my second smoothie maker. They are no good after one years use. If you like thick shakes or smoothies forget about using the spout! If you try to pour the mixture out the top its a huge mess! For the first year it is the best! It whips frozen fruit and ice up effortlessly! However, after some time the seal and base will begin to loosen and disconnect while blending. So all your smoothie and milkshake mixture gets dumped into the motor! I am tired of going through this process, so I have decided to get a nice blender instead."
2,Dont Waste Your Money,If you make your smoothie to thick it wont flow out the spout. Dont waste your money and buy a good blender. I will be returning mine to the store.
4,The Evolving Human,"This is a great book about the powers of the human mind. Kelly is an excellent story teller and is able to take the reader through her experiences so clearly; that you actually feel like you are present with her.The book is definitely thought provoking and the reality is sometimes scary. It is a compelling reading. I found it difficult to put down as I was drawn into every experience.I also enjoyed interviewing Kelly on my Internet Radio Talk Show ""Love and Balance with Chidi"" on Voice America Networks.Chidi Asika-Enahoro,Author of ""Innocence Interrupted"".Innocence interrupted: A sexual molestation survival & prevention guide"
3,Graphic SF Reader,This has Mystique issues 14-18 in it.Mystique is sent to Europe to look into the possiblity that a company there is doing the use mutants as lab rats and see what they can get out of them manoeuvre.Shortpack tags along. What they discover actually goes a lot further than just a little bit of experimentation.
5,creative story,"I always liked X-Men as a kid and when I heard about this series involving Mystique, actually working towards the greater good, it got my attention- I have only read the first three books in the series, but I think its a fun story- Mystique who has always been one of the most famous villians in the series working for Magneto is based on surrounding circumstances forced to work for Charles Xavier. This book continues the story of mystique as an undercover agent for the leader of the X-men and like the first two books its very entertaining. The graphics are great and the story is fun providing the usual comic book action. If you are a fan of the X-men, i think that this provides for a continuing enjoyable story following the complex character of mystique as she is forced to make ultimate choices as to whether she wants to continue to work for the greater good, which is clearly out of line with her past character. Good clean fun"
1,Why are there 25 reviews by four or five people?,"Since when is Mara Denise Richards?The artwork was inconsistent and crummy, and the dialogue was like a forced sitcom comedy. The whole being toasted by the galaxy thing was stupid. Like that would happen. The real Jedi Order would be aghast, since to them serving the force wasn't a five ring celebrity circus. Like Entertainment Tonight on steroids. CHEESY.Han and Leia deserved this comic series to be about them, instead of half a page in a book that was told from Luke's perspective. Of course, since Star Wars has turning into the Life and Times of Mara, instead of the Skywalker/Solos, what should I expect? Miracles?"
5,At last...,"As a child, I was sure I was going to grow up and marry Luke Skywalker, but I admit that Mara is perfect for him. Ever since I read Heir to the Empire, I have been waiting for this wedding. The book was fun to read, and the wedding dress part was great. I loved how characteristics of all the main people were captured so well. The only thing I was disappointed with was Mara. She looked too cute, like a high school cheerleader- not at all the picture presented of her in the books. But still, the book was a blast. I highly recommend it."
4,"Good, but not too ""Star Wars""","I think the events despicted by this graphic novel occur right after Vision of the Future, the drawing style was almost photorealistic (specialy Han's expressions on ""The Red Rancor"") there is a lot of cinematic action, and of course the main story about Luke's wedding with Mara, (BTW: I think she looked ok by being cute, what would you expect on a woman in love?).The only thing that strikes me is that sometimes just doesn't feel Star Wars, there are many dark gothic scenes, (ok, it's the dark side some may say, but what about the gothic?) I don't remember any SW comic being so dark, it's a Star Wars story not Batman or Spawn! I don't know if that has anything to do with Skackpole's writing style, after all Onslaught and Ruin had a diferent action pace (Mangalike I would say)."
3,Epic Cliche,I didn't dislike it only because I wanted to get this side of the story for Luke and Mara... But it was written so poorly and with seemingly so little thought of non-cliche imagination that I have trouble believing Mr. Stackpole had any say. 2.5 stars
4,Almost Perfect,"This book was pretty much excellent. It was about Luke and Mara's wedding, and we all wanted to see that. The thing with the wedding gowns was funny. I thought it was weird that a Hutt would try to sell a Hutt gown to a Human, thinking a different color would make it better. The only bad thing was that at some times I couldn't tell who was talking. Also, the riot at Luke's bachelor party made no sense. It kind of looked like it was shortened from what it was intended to be. But that's about it."
4,Good but could be better,Where to start? The UP side: I thought that it showed a more careing side of Luke and Mara. The relationship between Luke and Mara was well put.The Down side: Unlike many of the readers of this novel I am yet to read the Mara Jade comic but I also thought the animation in this comic was very poor. Also the action was not there which was ok with me because thats not what the comic was about (if the only reason you read star wars is for the battles than I do not suggest this Comic for you.) In more than one ways the flaws in this comic were simalar to the flaws in The Courtship of Princess Leia such as Poor charachterization and a loose foucas.All things consider I would like to see a better editied novel of these comic and I would HIGHLY recomond theses comic to Luke and Mara fans and Star Wars romance fans and would NOT recomond it to star wars action fans
1,Not so hot,"I hate to rain on anyones parade, but I was very unimpressed with this book. To me, the dialog seemed strained, the plot disjointed and the love scenes overly syrupy. Sorry, but I think the reader can do better elsewhere."
2,SW: Union... ::yawn::,"After reading all these glowing reviews of Star Wars: Union, I purchased it from Amazon.com. Unfortunately, it wasn't interesting, nor worth the money. Although the drawings were substandard compared to other Star Wars graphic novels, the story was awful. The plot consists of several Imperials who view Mara Jade (aka the Emperor's hand) and Luke Skywalker's wedding as a sign of bad things to come for their group. So, like most villains, they decide to crash the wedding at all costs. It sounded fairly interesting, but when read, it was executed very poorly. If you're a die-hard Star Wars fan and love Mara Jade and Luke Skywalker (I'm very interested in both characters), and don't care for a weak plot, then this is for you. For the remainder of the group, I suggest reading the other Mara Jade graphic novel, which is superior in all aspects to ""Union""."
3,Not as good as it could be,"This sometimes confusing comic should have had a great story. The idea was a good one. I am sorry to say that it didn't inspire the imagination or hold interest for long. Don't get me wrong. As comics go, this is okay. I read it completely through once, but will never feel the need to pick it up again. Die hard fans beware: You will not be falling in love with this one."
5,Riveting and moving - not just a children's book...,"A lyrical, sweeping, epic story of survival against the odds. It is 2099 - and the world is gradually drowning, as mighty Arctic ice floes melt, the seas rise, and land disappears forever beneath storm-tossed waves. For 15-year-old Mara, her family and community, huddted on the fast-disappearing island of Wing, the new century brings flight. Packed into tiny boats, a terrifying journey begins to a bizarre city that rises into the sky, built on the drowned remains of the ancient city of Glasgow. But even here there is no safety and, shut out of the city, Mara realizes they are asylum-seekers in a world torn between high-tech wizardry and the most primitive injustice. To save her people, Mara must not only find a way into the city but also search for a new land and a new home..."
3,Good book,"This book is a decent young adult novel. I'm an adult who read it and some of the pages were a little young for me, but all-in-all the story was captivating. I was curious to see what became of the characters."
3,mmm...,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed reading this book immensley although I couldn't help but feel it was somewhat poorly written.The plot is very interesting, it is about a girl named Mara who's island is sinking into the ocean due to the effects of global warming (this story is set in the future) and it is almost frightening to see what the world may oneday become.But I still think that the beginning of this book contained too much detail and the end had very little.I got slightly bored of this book after a few chapters and was about to give up on it if a friend hadn't advised me against it and although I am glad I have read the book, I still think it lacks her emotion, feelings and realism.Yes, I realise it's set in the future and I have to use my imagination but it wasn't the global warming that bothered me, it was the lack of deepness in the book.Saying that, it was a fun read and I am sure, had this story been written with more care and emotion, this would have been a classic."
3,Well.........,I know that I never read the long reviews so I will try to keep it short.This is a story about a girl named Mara who lives on an island in he future. The book is full of Mara's adventures from when she leaves the island because of the terrible flooding. Depending on what kinds of books you like you may either love or hate this book. If you are looking for something even a little romantic DO NOT read this (there is a LITTLE romance but it's pathetic). I thought the book was good but not great. The reviews I read were nothing like what the book was really like so just read the book or don't
5,Vintage fat cat Garfield,"In this story, Duke, a Hollywood stunt cat, challenges Garfield to a race around the block. To prove that he is without fear, Garfield accepts, but when he begins training, quickly realizes that he can't even run around the block much less win a race. Therefore, he decides to rely on his brainpower, i. e. he will cheat. His first scheme is to put springs on his feet, but that leads to his banging his head on a tree. The next idea is to put on roller skates and hang on to Odie's ear. This works fine until Odie stops to inspect a fire hydrant. The final scheme is successful. Garfield riles up a mean dog by telling it that Duke has said some very disparaging things about him. The dog chases Duke up a tree and Garfield walks alone across the finish line.This story is vintage Garfield, the lazy cat that will do anything to avoid physical exertion. All cat and Garfield lovers will appreciate and enjoy it."
4,Great for mixed groups of Christians & non-Christians,"I work full-time with college students. As a part of leading a small group, I prepare weekly discussions. Sometimes I like to have a book or bible study to help me form questions that could be good for our discussions. I rarely use bible studies question-by-question. I usually just use resources like this one to help me guide my own writing of questions. It's suprising to me how many studies are of no help if you are working with a small group that has both Christians and non-Christians. This is one of the few studies that has questions that are answerable for both groups. Many times I would be writing my own questions, and then I would glance at this study, and I would find that they had written a discussion question I was trying to write but couldn't find the words for."
2,Waste of Money !!!,"This Cd is nothing but Quik buying time before his next studio release and trying to suck every dollar out of you possible.Most fans of Quik probably have most of his cd's already,making this disc worthless(even to newcomers).If you are looking for a good disc that covers Quik's career,buy The Best of:The Finale.Its a better and more complete collection of songs and its NOT LIVE!The only reason this disc recieved two stars was for the track selection."
4,Love the detailed instructions and comments on the side.,"No, it's not really a 30 minute cooking book but it is a very instructive book. Even for those who have been in the kitchen for a while, you could learn some really good tips. It logically explains why you may try things differently. Peeling, cutting, dicing vegetables, etc. Very elementary stuff. However, I wish it was in color though. It would make the books really huge but I think it would be worth it."
2,Not very tasty,There are few recipes here that are very inspired. This anthology seems very hastily put together (perhaps that's the real quickness) and again like the previous reviewed said a quick review of their magazine with all that why this recipe is sooo good. Problem is the recipes are often bland and when you read why you can often see what they did wrong. That was helpful ;-)but still there are other books out here in this space and I'd recommend giving them a try instead.
3,"bajo la sal , murders murders... buy from this seller, lowest price...","Teen girls keep getting kill, I give this movie a 3star, I wanted it to be a lil more scary.... Guess it wasn't too scary but its pretty cool, dvd was new, I'm saying this because I had to order this movie two times just because the other seller sent me a used non working dvd but I got a refune, this is the lowest price I found on this dvd."
4,Passion wins out,"Although I must agree with another reviewer concerning the spelling and grammar of this book, I nonetheless think that is an important book. The conversational style of writing does indeed sound like coffee house banter but that it what I liked about it. Other books, such as Dr. Griffin's are obviously better researched and more scholarly. However, Mr. Williams style, and obvious passion for the subject, make this a good companion piece to ""the New Pearl Harbor"". I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wonders what really happened on 9/11/01."
1,buy a real 9/11 truth book instead of this,David Ray Griffin's Debunking 9/11 Debunking is the best. Williams' books are intended to discredit the real cause of 9/11 truth by putting out poorly written books that simply regurgitate the findings of the many researchers who are sincerely working to uncover and expose what really happened on 9/11.
5,911 was an inside job!,911 was an inside job. We must oppose the government that has enslaved us. Most cops are abusive and the FBI is an outlaw organization. I say freedom forever. This book is what we need more of.By Christian Peper
1,Bad quality... fell apart,"in a softer wall, even in the studs,the wood split, the metal holders slipped,and i ended up throwing it away.Horrible"
3,Celtic Mandalas ( used ),"This is a lovely book. It is a used copy and is worn, but still very usable. I have enjoyed learning more about mandalas"
3,Slow,"It works. It is slow. And it is difficult to get the cards into the adapter slot. Getting them in is a pain, but getting them out requires ejecting the entire PCMCIA adapter."
4,nice clipboard,"the edges are a little sharp but not uncomfortable in hand. can hold a decent amount of paper, the retaining bar is quite strong and grippy. lightweight for its durability."
2,Size Isn't Correct.,"As a medical student, I bought this to fit in the pocket of my white coat as a hard surface to write on during morning rounds. The clipboard itself seems fantastic: very sturdy, really strong clip that could hold a ton of papers. But it's not 5.75""; it's actually 6.5"", which happens to be too large for my coat pockets.Too bad, but they really should be more accurate, especially since for people like me the actual size is very important."
3,F - L - I - M - S - Y,"Hardboard clipboards are much more rigid. I like the clip on this one, but it has a LOT of flex to it. Not yet sure if I will return this item"
5,Does its job,"I use this clipboard for work and so far its performed very well. Many complain that it is flimsy but its a clipboard, not a diving board. I also like the fact that it is made right here in the USA! Keep up the good work Saunders and Amazon!"
5,The best baby book for documenting special memories,"This baby book has it all. A calender with stickers for marking special events, a place to describe your baby month by month, sections for special milestones, and ample space for pictures. Truely a find for any new parent who wants to create a baby book to cherish."
5,A Really Great Book!,I purchased this book just after my daughter was born in January of 2000. It was a wonderful and easy way to track her important milestones and her little ones. I especially like having a picture with each month so you can see how your little one grows and changes. We are expecting our second child in October and I am buying another one for this child!
2,Disappointing,I had high expectations for this book which it just doesn't come close to achieving. The information on the musicians inside is rather basic and nothing you probably won't already know if you are a fan of any of them. There are no pictures at all inside and the text is written in a rather boring way. I had hoped to be able to look up songs or movie soundtrack albums in the index and see who actually sang them so I could order them on Amazon or somewhere but only artists are listed in the index and the book does not contain soundtrack albums at all. A very poor effort of what could have been a great and handy beneficial reference tool.
4,Quite comprehensive for the UK side of the shore..,"Nice collection of info's about 80's music,,,no pictures inside,,just entries of bands,,biased on British music scene..500 pages of info's on a decade of memorable music,,encyclopedia style...1st edition, this one is...2nd ed already out but definitely more expensive at $30.00 plus....1st ed dirt cheap -less than $5.00"
2,Targus Basic Messenger Case Designed for 15.6 Inch Laptops TCM004US (Black),This Bag is not the best fell apart in no time threads pull apart. Iwould not wast my money on this Bag!!!Targus Basic Messenger Case Designed for 15.6 Inch Laptops TCM004US (Black)
1,Lasted just over a year,"So disappointed with this. My son has used this on school days (not summers) for one year and 2 months -- 2 months outside the return deadline. The cord compartment ripped out on the bottom of the case just today. Very thin material, not meant for heavy use. Looking for a new one."
4,Targus Basic Messenger Case Designed for 15.6 Inch Laptops TCM004US (Black),Targus Basic Messenger Case Designed for 15.6 Inch Laptops TCM004US (Black) large number of compartments in the bag is very comfortable to carry the laptop computer
4,Good value for the price.,There is a wide price range for laptop carrying cases. I wanted something relatively inexpensive because I won't use it a lot. Wanted to take my laptop on vacation. I was very happy with the quality of the bag & the # of storage areas it offers. Very good buy for the price.
4,Great laptop case for the price,"I don't understand why laptop cases are so expensive. This is the exception - great price - study construction - nice strap- PC tiedowns.Only negative is that it does not have a great volume of storage space in addition to the laptop compartment. It's fine for a power brick and cords, cables, accessory mouse, and a couple of pads and pencils. But if you carry a lot of manuals or other bulky items, look for an expandable briefcase instead."
3,Messenger notebook case,I liked this notebook case at first. But I carry alot of documents with my laptop and the top flap is held into place with the clasp. When there is a lot of weight it seems to stress the clasp. So far I have had not problems. I would like one of these with a decent storage place from the AC Adapter. All in all a decent notebook case.
5,totally awsome!!,"i got this bag as a gift for a friend,he absolutely loves it!!!i would recommend this bag to anyone"
5,Nice simple laptop messenger bag.,"Nice simple laptop messenger bag, holds my Dell 1525 in a neoprene sleeve very well. Still has space for some little accessories like power supply, mouse, pens, etc."
5,Very satisfactory for the price,"If you are looking for an elegant leather bag, look elsewhere. This one is plain, functional, easy to use, and holds everything I need without being too bulky. It will hold, for instance, my laptop, the charger, a handful of pens and post-it notes, a folder and a notepad very nicely. It is a very satisfactory product for the price and I would probably have paid even a little more for it... it is a fairly good deal. It has the perk of having a zipper-closure laptop section, and a flip-over top that snaps shut, providing double protection from rain or other abuse. A functional and useful bag. No problems that I am aware of; it's just what it says it is."
4,Nice budget bag,I bought this to transport my sister's laptop and was impressed when I got it. For the $20 it is definitely worth the buy...but if you looking for a heavy duty case you will have to fork out some more pesh. Overall it was well worth it.
4,Great Organizer,Very nice laptop bag for the money. Lots of storage space. Let's you get eveything well organized.
3,Probably won't hold up long term,The bag fits my 15 inch laptop great. The handle and strap for the bag feels cheap and with such a large laptop I question it's longevity. The strap isn't padded but has a rubberized shoulder protector. This bag is a fine short term solution until a person can save up for something more rugged. I'm concerned long term use will lead to the handle failing and my laptop on the ground broken. I will be replacing this bag as soon as i can because I'd rather spend $70 on a bag than hundreds of dollars for a new computer.
2,low end bag,this bag is fine for the price. but with the reviews i thought it would be better. You get what you pay for. Small storage and it feels cheap. It will get the job done but that is the extent of it.
4,Pretty decent bag for $20,"This bag is pretty thin, to my surprise, but it was capable to carry all of my binders and pencils. The only problem i saw was when carrying my 15"" Macbook Pro, it was pretty heavy so i try not to carry it using this bag. Overall, really great bag. I'd give it a 4.5"
4,basic and functional,"I bought this bag to replace a similar one that had slowly frayed and broken in a number of places. In particular, I wanted a bag that I could use for my laptop sometimes, but for books and papers at other times.It does the job, but I would like a bit more space, and maybe a zippered pocket on the outside (top or back) for quick access--the back pocket is only velcro and makes me nervous about putting keys or wallet in it.The strap clasps are only plastic, which makes me a bit nervous about how long they will last (I tend to carry a lot of junk around with me). Otherwise, no complaints. It's nondescript enough to look professional enough for me (PhD student), and it seems like it will protect my computer well enough."
4,Nice carrying case,I like my new carrying case. It has plenty of room and a nice space on the read of the case for carrying important papers. It's strong and expands for including accessories for your computer.
4,Messenger +,"This bag will carry your laptop,cords,mouse with ease,only holds a 15 inch screen comfortably. It's sturdy and the material is easy clean."
5,excelent product,"I really like this case! For the price, it is a very good product,It has enough room for my laptop and other things I need with my laptop."
5,Very nice bag...,"Quality product. Fits a 15.4"" laptop perfectly. I'm very happy and the price was great. I mean...this is all you really need."
1,Too shoddy,I wouldn't use this bag to carry a laptop through an airport or any other activity in which I would expect the bag to actually protect my computer. I regret that I did not spend more money to purchase a sturdier bag. It would have been a wise investment.
4,Good for the price.,"For the price, it is a very good product. It does all I need it to do-- hold a laptop.Perhaps a little more space and padding would have been helpful though."
5,Great notebook case,I bought this Targus TCM004US case for my new HP laptop. It is a very good case for a very good price. It is everythig I needed.
4,Good Value and Serves the Purpose,You cannot beat this quality for the price. What else do you need if you simply want a nice bag to hold your computer that has adequate compartments.
5,Great Item at a Great Price!,This was just what I wanted for my personal laptop computer. It is completely functional for all of my needs and has extra storage space & pockets that helps keep me organized.
4,He love it,"I bought this bag for my boyfreind for Valentine's Day and he absolutely loved it. He said it is not bulky, it has just enough room on the inside for everything he needs. It is basic, but fashionable."
5,Perfect and roomy,"Great laptop bag. It's easy to carry around without having any shoulder or back pain. It's kinda roomy. I'm able to slip one of my textbooks in the front pouch and put papers in the back. Great bag for a college student.And for $15.99, it's a deal!"
1,poor workmenship,This case for carrying a laptop computer seems to be well constructed but after just a few months use once each week one of the two zippers to close the top has the handle fall off. Also the carry strap which is sewed to each side came off the first time it was used. Had the bag for 3 months before using the strap.All in all Amazon should pull the item from it inventory and refund all purchases.Targus Basic Messenger Case Designed for 15.6 Inch Laptops TCM004US Black)
3,Fine,Could be better because it could have more pockets and a better laptop protection (foam). However is a good case.
3,adequate,"this product shows a shoulder strap in the picture, mine did not come with one; that is my only complaint."
4,Worth it,"I bought this laptop bag right after I got my new laptop. Didn't want to pay $50 for one. This bag is perfect, durable, and has plenty of pockets for the small stuff. This price is just frosting."
4,Targus notebook case,I think this case is a very good product for the money. It has extra room in it for your accesories and is well paded. If your looking for a case that is funtional and well made ths is it. Sam Mi.
4,handy carring case,I was pleased to get this bag with my purchase . The note book fits like a glove . It is very sturdy and comfortable to carry. I would tell all my friends of this excellent product.
3,Case? It is in't a hard protective plastic. It is a very nice nylon bag.,"This is not a hard protective case for a laptop. It is a very nice, multi-compartment nylon bag."
2,"Plastic was brittle, Fans became loud, difficult to mount 3.5"" HDD behind","After a few months of use the fans in this unit have gotten progressively louder. The plastic clips holding the ""dust"" screen onto this unit are fairly brittle. The second time I went to remove the ""dust"" screen from the front of this unit one of the plastic clips broke. I've purchased and used other cooling solutions (with dust screens) and none of those have broken (yet).This product did NOT come with any custom HDD mounting solution. It was difficult to mount a 3.5"" HDD behind this ""HDD cooler"". The plastic edges which sit inside the computer interfere with the mounting of standard HDD rails for mounting 3.5"" HDDs inside a 5.25"" bay."
3,Weak Mounting System,"1-The mounting area, holes & the provided two steel bracket does not fit my Thermaltake chassis which uses two plastic fast mount system, so I improvised to make it installed and work.Please note that it might fit to your case without any modifications, glue, etc. I'm talking here about my experience.2-The fans should come with 3 pin connector so that you and/or the system can control the fans speed according to temp.Plus I found no installation manual."
3,Cool at first,"I had 3 extra 5.25"" bays open on my rig, so I was shopping around for some accessories. I'm not using it for a hard-drive, but rather just some addition case cooling. It moves a decent amount of air, so I can't complain about that. It also looks nice and has a filter. My only complaint is after owning it for some time the fans make a terrible noises and vibrations when they first turn on, but it goes away after a few minutes.Here is a photo of the cooler installed in my computer (sorry about the dust) (...)"
3,Does an okay job of moving some air but nearly impossible to install as a hdd cooler.,"I wanted to fill in a 5.25"" bay, while moving a little extra air, on my gaming rig. It does a good job of that, but I'm giving it a low review because, As a hdd cooler it is useless. It is really hard to assemble, and doesn't really move enough air to keep anything cool that actually genuinely had a heat issue, the three fan version of this might be a little better though."
2,Hard Drive Cooler,"I purchased this item on 11/15/10 and it was listed as in stock through j&r music and computer world on 11/19/10 the vendor contacted me and stated the item was back ordered. On 11/28/10 I contacted seller and wished to be advised of status of the order, now the ability to leave the seller feedback or rating is gone from my account and the seller still has not notified me of the status and I do not know if I should try to find another product or wait on a back order. In the last month I have had more problems with purchases through Amazon than in the whole of last year and am thinking of finding a new place to purchase and I purchase a lot. I CAN NOT HONESTLY REVIEW THIS PRODUCT AS I DO NOT HAVE IT AND DO NOT KNOW IF I WILL EVER GET IT. Beware of who you purchase this from."
1,Wrong picture and description,"Twice I tried to order this product in beige for my older computer. Twice it was sent in black. After the second time, Amazon said they didn't know why the picture and description said beige but it kept coming in black. I finally gave up and returned both."
3,Fine Collection of Jazzy Trip Hop,Another nice collection of jazzy trip hop (acid jazz dance if you prefer). Not as great as the first two in the collection but some nice tracks.
1,What a rip-off,"These films were supposed to have been remastered... you could have fooled me !! BAD in all respects. The only reason that I don't dump the DVD is because it's the only one available of ""Rainbow on the River"" If you expect a REMASTERED item don't bother, you will be grossly disappointed."
1,"Translation, adaptation or worse?","Ranjit Bolt's ""translation"" of La Locandiera is a witty, playable text, but don't labor under the misapprehension that it has much to do with what Goldoni wrote. In scene after scene after scene, Bolt supplies sequences of dialogue that are not in the original Italian in any way, shape or form. When he's not doing that, he radically re-interprets what Goldoni did write. You're not reading or seeing Goldoni in this version; you're reading or seeing Bolt, as inspired by Goldoni, but certainly not as Goldoni wrote.This is not unusual in translations of this play. Of the four texts I've studied, only the translation by Clifford Bax (1926) is actually a reasonably faithful rendition of Goldoni's text into English. Every other version I've read, including this one, is done under the idea that the translator is a better playwright than Goldoni, and we'll just stick the old Italian's name on the cover for marketing purposes."
5,A heartwarming and emotionally uplifting story,"The Love Me Bird by Joyce Dunbar is an endearing picture book story about a little Love-Me bird who just wants to be loved. So she sings her ""Love me!"" song all day, keeping poor Shut-Eye the owl awake. Yet no other bird comes... until the owl tells her a profound truth about love, and teaches her a new song: ""Love you!"" For a little bird can be both a ""Love me!"" and ""Love you!"" bird at the same time. A heartwarming and emotionally uplifting story, with simple and charming illustrations by Sophie Fatus, and especially delightful for celebrating Valentine's day -- anytime of the year!"
2,Be careful who and what you believe.,"If only every being that said it was an angel really was one. But in this case, as in so many others, to announce that there are no entities, dark forces, or - dare I say it? - evil - is a naive belief held by those who dabble in spirituality and really have no solid foundation in its practices. Much of the info in this book is misleading, although the authors seem to have the best intentions and have definitely put in much work. I originally bought this book for its info on ascension. There is some truth in what's laid out here to make it seem right, but again, some of it is misleading. For those who are truly interested in real spiritual growth and ascension, which has already begun, seek out true spiritual teachers who have walked the road and traveled the distances. They are few."
5,Kokopelli Shower Curtain Hooks- Set of 12,"These are not only beautiful, but very sturdy. I love how they look with the shower curtain. It's a wonderful set."
2,hardly even zip the case when all 96 disc is in,"for the price of the rebate, it is a good deal.Though don't expect you get an easy use of the case, especially all 96 discs are in case.With a big force to squeeze the case together, finally able to zip it, and you will get probably all the disc bent especially the outer sleeve onesIt is a bad design by having the same dimesion sleeves sew together in the center.Probably having 48 discs case would be more proper instead of 96 discs"
1,Don't fall in the number,"This product seems to be very cheap(...) as we expect it to hold 96 CD/DVD. But the truth is that it doesn't even hold 50 cd/dvd becoz of its poor design. You can comfortably keep 45 CDs without breaking any CD. Don't ever attempt to keep more than that, you'll end up in breaking your valuable cds. The main problem is due to the lesser width of the case; and the manufacturer never paid attention to the anticipated width after keeping 96 cds.The inner part of the sleeve seems to be very rough which may damage your cds. So stay away from this product."
3,Great Deal -- Bad Smell,"This is a great deal with the rebate, but the vinyl smell is awful. I'll probably have to let it air out for a month before I use it. Kinda smells like moth balls -- nasty."
2,Where are all these mistakes?,"I watched The Wizard of Os with this book's list of mistakes right by my side and I could not find most of the mistakes this book lists. I had another person watch it a second tiome with me and we could not find the things this author says are int he film. I have watched the film hundreds of times, up close on DVD, the restored versions, the old versions. These mistakes are not there.Waste of money. Maybe the other films are more accurate."
3,Average thermostat,"well what can i say? this thing runs cool all the time you are cruising and freeway/interstate traffic, once you get into traffic tho, the engine temp goes up to 210 on the gauge and sits there. i was worried after i installed this with my new water pump that it was faulty and my engine would overheat. But as soon as you get on the freeway after traffic the engine cools off basck to the 180/185 mark. tbh as and when i have to get a new thermostat i will go back to the ac-delco one. This isnt as good as they make it out to be."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered the ""Hypertech PowerStat Low Temperature 180 degree Thermostat"" because Hypertech recommended it to complement the Power Module I purchased earlier.After spending over two hours flushing my radiator and installing the new ""Low Temperature"" thermostat along with 2 gallons of fresh Prestone Dex-Cool Antifreeze for a total cost of $70 ($50 for the T-Stat, $20 for the antifreeze and $$$$ for my time), I started my 2000 GMC Sierra and it actually ran a few degrees hotter than it did with the OME thermostat.I emailed Hypertech Tech Support on July 22nd and have yet to receive a reply to my inquiry."
4,"Good product, just OK packaging","This is suppose to be the prefilter for your cartridge, is a way to keep the dirt, dust and any debris from getting in contact with the big cartridge filter.One would hope a better packaging because they were just tossed into a box without individual bags for each one, this should be fixed so the prefilters would reach the costumer totally clean and in better condition.But overall is a good product and a must have in order to properly operate the masks."
4,Replacement Filters,What can I say? They are the exact replacements for my face mask. They filter air when I paint. The box of 10 was cheaper that a pair of filters at my local store. Good job.
5,Syndicated Business Travel Columnist Offers Praise,"Here is what Tom Belden, business travel columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer has to say about this book:""Living up to the promise of its title, McGinnis' guidebook covers a wide range of subjects, offering practical advice about pre-trip planning, airlines, hotels, rental cars, international travel, navigating through airports, and staying healthy on trips. Interspersed are tales of McGinnis' experiences, little stories that demonstrate how even a seasoned road warrior can be subjected to the indignities that plague travelers. Especially entertaining is one tale about flying into Cleveland during a vicious thunderstorm and taking a city bus to a budget hotel, where the phones had been knocked out by the storm."""
5,"A warm, family style movie about the carol ""Silent Night""","I discovered this movie quite accidentally several years ago while channel ""surfing"" and spent months trying to find my own copy. This movie tells the tale of the origin of the Christmas carol ""Silent Night"" from the perspective of a little mouse called A. Nonny Mouse. Narrated by Lynn Redgrave, this warm family movie tells the tale of how the Christmas song was written but almost forgotten except for the efforts of A. Nonny Mouse and his mouse organization. Set in Austria, this is the perfect holiday movie to watch with the entire family. Nothing objectionable, no violence."
3,Ok,"Product does not contain multicolored thread as shown in the image, only army green (4 spools) and black (2 spools). Also, it only came with one needle and few other sewing accessories. I wouldn't recommend it to others."
3,G.I. style sewing kit,"I recommend the product,but not at this price. Its about a $3.00 value IMO, NOT $6.25. As another reviewer stated, this kit does not come with multi-colored thread as pictured. This doesn't bother me, as black and green are primarily what I will need but the picture should be product-correct. My biggest complaints are that the sewing supplies come in a flimsy plastic bag inside the pouch and it only comes with one needle. I suppose that would be fine for some people,but I used an empty Altoids mint can to store the items in, added 5 more needles that varied in size and a few larger spare buttons. The can fits in the pouch pefectly. I give it 3 stars because of the price and the thin plastic bag."
2,whatever,"Don't bother. You can do better at your local pharmacy. Pro: it has a little of everything (buttons, needles, safety pins, etc.) but it's hardly worth the $5."
4,Okay I guess,"kept in the glove box for those odd times when you pop a button or need to sew a torn shirt or what not. not much to be said, added a few extra needles and bobby pins for our use."
4,It has served me well,"I'm new to sewing and all I really do is fix up things I have torn. This product has served me well for that sort of quick and dirty repair work.The only ""negatives"":The scissors aren't the best, but they do their job.The button on the pouch is a little tough to open."
5,Current Events In fiction story,"I read End Of Days last year and I have been recommending it to everyone I know ever since. I thought the book was well thought out and very scripturally based. I really appreciated the journalistic style of the novel. I came away from the book thinking, ""The end of days really could end this way..."" Now, in light of current events, I need to reread the book. It is as if he wrote a news story before it happened. I would highly recommend the book to anyone who wants a realistic portrayal of how the Prophesies concerning the last days may be fulfilled."
3,Fairy,"This book wasn't what I expected, but regardless this book gave information on certian essential oils and how to dry flowers. The book gives on recipes on making potpourri. The only thing wrong with some of these potpourri recipes is ingredients not available to purchase."
1,Did not receive,"I did not receive this book, instead I received Making Herbal Dream Pillows. I like the book that I was sent but I would have liked the one that I ordered."
1,a bit of a waste,"the book is just a bit too cutesy, and doesn't really fit in any category. It is certainly not a guide to scent or perfume blending, nor is it a book about aromatherapy. I regret spending the money on it, and plan to offer it used for the price of shipping."
1,Dubbed,A French movie dubbed in English... Sad. Why does Amazon not have the original version available with subtitles? It's called RESPECT for an original.
2,don't waste your time,this is really a waste of time. the directing is dreadful. the script is not much better. this looks like a grad students semester project.
2,The other Hitomi Nishiyama?,More of a clarification than a review... It may be worth noting that this Hitomi Nishiyama is apparently NOT the Hitomi Nishiyama who is a really excellent jazz pianist. This is music by an interesting Japanese pop musician that will not do much for fans of Jazz piano.
4,blue and rose gold,"great colors on this watch ,its beautiful,but the bezel is nearly razor sharp. and catches on anything with long sleves."
3,The quality is poor,"With all the great review I was thrilled when this arrived. The silver covers are glued to clear plastic covers that screw on the jars. 2 of the silver caps were un-gluded, I will have to re-stick them with some crazy glue. Makes you wonder how many more will fall off....Update, the angle of the bottles make it almost impossible to read the labels, we are going to keep the spices and not use the rack on the counter.....Update of Update, so super glue works great on the cap issue.... We have found that this rack works great on top of the fridge, added bonus its out of the way and you can read the labels. So we will end up using this rack."
2,Decent...but a dissapointment,"Good qualities= appearance, good quality spices includedBad qualities=1. cheaply made; bottom plastic piece broke on the first day I had it.2. tops of spice containers are flimsy/cheap and do not close easily or securely unless you really press on them.3. Sea salt granuals (large ones)are one of the spices...the variety best used with a grinder or crushed. workable...but I did not expect salt to be one of my spices.4. Lack several very common seasonings. I use 95 percent of what they included...but this rack does not have the basics such as garlic, onion, ect. I cook a large variety of foods, but for the average cook this selection of spices will be frustrating.And the size of this product was not an issue for me, but I have a lot of counter space. I would plan on this rack taking up a 12""x12"" space, plus allow for the room needed for it to turn. This is NOT a space saver item for a kitchen with limited counter space."
2,Larry S review,"Spice jars are positioned and labeled in such a way as to make the jar label invisible unless the jar is removed and looked at from a different angle. Bending and kneeling down are required if you don't pull out each jar for examination. This is a daunting task when you have to search through some 30 odd jars to find a particular spice. While fairly attractive in its carousal presentation, it was obviously designed by a person who would never use it. Once designed,be assured, the designer never tested the design to determine any flaws to be corrected. It's a big flaw, rendering the spice carousal not at all user friendly and quite inconvenient. Buy a spice rack configured differently."
3,the many ways of being smart,"The book was good. But when I picked out the book I thought that it was going to be more about outsmarting people. That's ok I still like the book. It has a lot of interesting things it teaches you about your brain, like the brain grows for sizes in its life time."
4,Required reading for class,"I purchased this book for a college psychology course. The author's main point is to describe how getting together with people from different fields, cultures, etc. can help you to innovate new and unique ideas. The examples throughout the text are interesting and inspiring. The language had a nice flow and didn't get too bogged down. I would recommend this book to graduate students who are trying to come up with new experimental ideas."
3,A little too patronizing,"The catch phrases and repetition do drive the point home that you need to find opportunities at the ""Intersection"" of your experiences, but he makes it sound -- for lack of a better word -- cheesy. In many instances he cites the research of his Harvard professors, almost to the point where he loses credibility by not citing anyone he doesn't regard as a personal friend. Great concept, mediocre execution. The book gets you thinking about where your ideas might converge... it's just too bad the only way he knows how to say that is ""to put yourself in the Intersection""."
4,Better than it would appear,"This book is about developing ideas. It starts out very slowly and it seems like just another rehash of the tales told a hundred times before. It goes through the normal diversity is better arguement, which is a plus and a minus (he never gives us the minus). But as the book develops he provides a family of keen insights. He reviews much of the literature in an interesting way. Even old news is presented nicely. For example, at this point most people know that brainstorming does not really get you anywhere. Indeed, individuals will come up with more ideas than a team all working together, one after the other. He goes through this and then suggests alternatives. By the time I was done with the book I was impressed and I would recommend it to others."
2,"Come back Edward de Bono, all is forgiven","A rehash of lateral thinking, in particular the idea of a 'provocation'. Johansson's stories are fun. de Bono got there first."
4,A great read on innovation and creativity,A great read on innovation and creativity which comes pretty close to having an algorithm for innovation.
3,interesting book but need to be better,"1. the author have something to say, and he say it in a easy way that friendly to understand. it's good. But the author seems too hush to run into the conclusion, it seems if he spend more time in detail study, this book will be much better;2. For the same topic, I suggest ""A Technique for Producing Ideas"" which is short but powerful; and it from a master's hand, if you compare that book with ""Medici Effect"", you will find how good it is, ;-);"
4,Dr Doolittle for a new generation,"Just how many Dr Doolittle films can they make?Doolittle 3 could be entitled, the Next Generation. Kyla Pratt takes the reins of talking to the animals and center stage as she struggles to cope with teen age lonliness and unpopularity. Her skill in 'animal' is put to good use as she even finds herself in the White House in the beginning of the film.Clearly, the focus of this film is far removed from the original Rex Harrison production, but aimed at a Hannah Montana/Zoey audience. In that, it succeeds well.Look for it at your local video store.Tim Lasiuta"
4,Funny,Along the same lines as the first two but with a twist with the eldst daughter. Comedy with a fun aspect
2,Pretty awful,"So often a series sits on its laurels and continues to crank out episodes and the audience continues to see them because they are not terrible. Then, inevitably, the makers vomit something out with the same name, it's atrocious, and they take the viewers' money on the half effort and that's the end of it. Doctor Dolittle 3 is therefore the end.There was no point in making this. It lacks eddie murphy (they have him on the phone talking to his wife, but one cannot even hear his voice). Unlike the first two which were at least somewhat funny in a very goofy way (worth watching if you're dying to kill an evening), this was a sleep-fest--literally. About 25 min in I was in an epic battle with my eyelids, pulling out all the stops to stay awake and avoid the wrath of my wife. Alas, the eyelids won (don't they always?).The characters on this are silly, the plot...oh, I don't know why I'll bother anymore; The movie is just bad, I'd recommend skipping it."
4,soft,"This brush is so soft, sturdy and works well. I have been using it daily for three months and it still looks brand new."
2,Mediocre,"Rick Roessler's low-budget and comedic offshoot of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one mess of a movie and here's why the plot and storyline really copies TCM with a fat farmer named Buddy who acts like a hog and kills trespassers on his farm or if they mess with his hogs,second the acting seems like these so-called actors are in a High School play and reading their lines off a q-cards,third the special effects are cheap but sometimes decent like the scene where he slashes a teen's face and blood shoots all over a van window. Please do not buy this movie but if you see this at Hollywood video rent it for a laugh or to make fun of. Slaughterhouse is a stinker."
4,ONE OF MY FAVES!,"I won't bother going into the plot, it's all been said. I will say if you are a fan of 1980's horror, this is for you!A fun film about a now defunct slaughterhouse owner, his interesting son (who can't talk, he only makes pig noises) and the people trying to get him to sell his slaughterhouse to a guy who's only interest is profits from selling bad pork.The death scenes are good and sometimes very funny. The acting at times is very cliche' for 1980's, but still fun."
2,i could do better!,"i was excited to get this, but when i watched it i wish i hadn't!he doesn't show all of the aspects of boat repair it is just, all of a sudden it's done.i wanted to see it being done.the editing leaves a lot to be desired,noise in the background,out of focus,you can here the camera guy.it reminds me of the old 1980's porn movies!"
2,Overpriced!,"This slot machine is not worth $24.99, maybe $9.99. It is the quality of a cheap toy. I returned it."
4,pretty solid,"yo brahskys i got t'is 'oy and i t'ink it's pretty dang flabbin goood, aight. but not 2 sol'd"
2,"Chest clip broke, now useless...","We've had this car seat maybe for about a year. My son is now two, will be 3 in 3 mos. I really did like this car seat, until the chest clip broke, and I discovered that it was irreplaceable. I'm going to be looking into getting a booster seat next. Probably the Graco CarGo Platinum. Hopefully I will have better luck with that."
2,mediocre production,"Modern aspect of Strauss' Elektra though not of high quality. The director's aspect was totally uncaused and unreasonable, pitty for the singers and the conductor.Johansson is the best VOCALLY Elektra I have ever 'seen' on stage. HOWEVER her acting has nothing to do with Elektra of Eva Marton (the best Elektra ever for me) Gwyneth Jones, Birgit Nilsson, L. Rysanek. I feel she had NO HELP at all from the stage director.The whole production, GENERALLY, lucks of inspiration and good acting."
4,"Beautiful, inventive book.","My daughter recieved this for her second birthday, and loves it. It is beautifully illustrated and the layout is truly imaginative. The words and rhythm lend themself easily to bedtime-friendly reading (that is, getting quieter and slower as you go along). My only issue with this book is from the ""bedtime"" standpoint. The deep colors, combined with the watercolor style and offbeat typeface, while charming, make it rather hard to read in dim light. And for a book geared toward bedtime, that may be something to take into consideration."
4,"Good book, but felt like I had read just an overview.","Having read this book and enjoyed I feel I should pass on my thoughts. Firstly, and most importantly, this book appeared to me to be more of an overview of what took place hence it being only around 100 pages (minus many photos and maps ect...). If you are looking for a book that will give you an idea of what happened without the intricacies of the lead up and subsequent end to the wars then this will work for you. If you expect to read extracts from those who were there and a detailed account of the Zulu Wars then you will be disappointed. It mostly talks about Rorkes Drift, which is great and what many would like to read, but I felt like I had just read an introduction to the Zulu War campaign. This is probably a book that can whet your appetite for campaign before you find something with much more detail. As I said this still a good read!"
4,A GOOD starter Bass,"I liked this Bass a lot. It has a great sound, it looks half-decent and is great for playing in metal-bands. However, when you mastered this Bass, you're gonna want something better. But if you just wanna pick-up and play, this is your instrument."
3,A new twist,Have been to Vermont many times but now I'll have to return. The author did a very good job of showing the much lesser known history of this great state. Deserves a revisit!
4,Hack and Slash,"Well I bought this game in a day. I was browsing Gamespot and tumbled upon a video of this game, the next day I saw it at a local store so I bought it. It's a fairly easy game and mostly you just Press your way to the end. You only have to hit 2 buttons to attack.The only major problem people have is the hero. He really looks like a girl... Swordplay is colorfull (strikes of blue and green) and blurry... as if the air around the blades moved. Not really worth this much, wait for around 20-30."
5,Must have for Gackt fans!,"I'm very happy this game came to the U.S.! It is quite a fun game, with RPG style to it. You get to play as Gackt and what fangirl doesn't love that? Plus you can unlock all kinds of Gackt interviews,pictures and music. If you are a Gackt fan this is a MUST BUY!!"
5,I'm Glad I Bought It,"Helpful, informative, I'm glad I bought it. I especially like the little boxes at the start of each project that describe the time, tools, talent, cost, tips, gains, and complementary modifications needed or useful. This book gave me the courage to tackle a project I might have dodged and to avoid projects that were over my head. I only wish it were a little larger, say . . . 202 projects?"
2,Only Marginally Helpful,"I bought this thinking it might have more detail, both in description and photos, on how to perform the simpler repair and maintenance tasks on a Harley. Instead, one gets only the broadest sense of how such tasks might be done, and you get the feeling you're still better off leaving the work to a Harley mechanic. Not much help."
4,great performance ideas for TC88,I am enjoying the book. It gives a lot of performance ideas and also tidbits of knowledge that I was not aware of.
2,Save Your Money and buy a Service Manual instead,This book is way too General. You can get the same or better advice and ideas on the many on-line HD or V-Twin forums. Articles in this book provide good common performance ideas but it fails to provide sufficient details for follow through. More times than not this book refers you to the service manual. Save your money. If you plan on doing mods on your bike on your own then your knowledge base is likely above the level of this book already. Save the money to buy the service manual and search the on-line Harley forums for performance enhancements that you may want to make on your bike.
5,Great overview of all the sweet twin cam mods.,"This book reminds a lot of the old books put out by Petersen Publishing in the late 60's and early 70's. High quality, heavy bond pages that are dense with information and pictures. I use this book to plan exactly what parts, tools, and information I need as I upgrade each component group on my Road King and it was also a great read in general."
2,Too general,The book is too vague. All the tasks fail to go into any kind of detail. Unless you have access to a Harley mechanic I would leave this one alone.
1,Lack of answers a big problem,"I bought this to study for the California license exam which is currently based on the 1999 Code. This book is based on the 2002 Code but the Code doesn't change that much. The big problem is that the answer key is not included. Evidently, if you buy directly from Mike Holt.com the key is included. I don't know why. But the 1999 prep guide, available from Amazon, does include the answers in the back.In the introduction, on page ix, it says that the answers are available at his web site. This is not so. I do not know why the answer pamphlet is not included. Amazon and Mike will have to battle this one out.Now the diagrams are in color but the pages are smaller. I would advise getting the 1999 edition.~Peter"
2,Not for the lone student,"There are no answers to any of the questions at the end of the chapters. And there are a lot of questions. For the student studying alone, there is no sense of reasurance or encouragement. No way to continually measure your progress.The book has all the makings of a solid piece of work. The author's teaching style, the graphics and illustrations are all great, but if you don't have any way of checking yourself it can be frustrating. If there are answers in the book, I couldn't find them."
5,Not bad... for a couple bucks,"This is a pretty decent cheapo case. If you want something that you'll use every day in the car or at your DJ gigs, then you may want to get something a little sturdier. For my [archival] purposes, however, it works just fine."
4,Excellent for FAR,"I purchased this 11/2006. For me this was a great deal!!!!I got it FAR and free shipping by using the Prime test drive for 30 days. So my total cost was .75 tax + .39 stamp for MIR = $1.14.I have used this and other 128 and 320 Xtremes for around a year now without any problems. They do exactly what I expect... they hold CD's and DVD's. But based on the reviews I've seen, I am Xtremely careful with the zipper, which I must admit, can be difficult when the case is full. But, the zipper hasn't broke yet. Besides, I use it for archival purposes and don't get in and out of it all the time.You can expect it to smell pretty bad until aired out. I left my 320 Case in the garage for a month before bringing it in the house. But, it's ok now. The 128 Case I recently purchased was not nearly as bad."
1,Broken zipper within weeks!,"We bought the Xtreme 320 holder. The zipper broke within weeks! This means you can't carry or store the thing unless it's flat. So, basically the money we spent on it is in the toilet. Guess you get what you pay for. We'll be buying a quality case now."
4,"Tough, but doesn't completely protect the contents","This case doesn't get the full 5 stars because while the heavy rubber exterior is certainly tough, the whole case can bend. There's no rigidity to the exterior, which could lead to CDs/DVDs breaking if it were stepped on or otherwise impacted.However, there is a pocket in the inside front and back cover, which you could insert some tough card/plastic for extra protection.The tag attached to the zipper feels a little flimsy, but that's a minor issue. If you're carrying the case around a lot, be aware that the handle is hard rubber, not soft or fabric, so your hands may get sore/tired quickly.I can still recommend this; it gets the job done. The smell mentioned in other reviews is there, but not overwhelming."
2,"Poor sleeve quality, and smells awful","Keep your nose a good 3 feet from this case. The vinyl material is a stinker. The sleeves do not look nor feel very durable and are not uniform in quality. For under $10 shipped, it may be a good buy if you seek extra storage."
2,cheap,"I guess I shouldn't have been surprised these are quite cheap. I'm not going to return them, but don't think they'll last long and aren't anything special. Look for something a little more sturdy."
2,Too big for me,"Too big for my taste, but with Amazon's free returns, no harm, no foul. I loved the look of these, but they were just too big for me, but maybe not you. Who knows? Give them a shot. If they don't work, send them back."
3,to bigg,loved them so much but they just fell of my face better to just go to like walmart and get some so you know they will fit
1,Not Tortoise -- Don't buy,"This product claims to be tortoise -- it is definitely not tortoise. This product has more of a leopard design and is geared more to a women audience. Fortunately, it was only a $5 mistake so I'm not too upset, just annoyed that this product was falsely advertised. Buyer beware."
3,Seller sent completely different pairs,"I ordered one pair of these sunglasses and received them quickly. I was very happy with my purchase, as the sunglasses were a deep brown color (like the photo) and looked pretty sleek. A month later, I misplaced them and wished to order two more pairs from the same seller. When they arrived, they looked more yellow-brown, like leopard-print. Very feminine and unflattering. I thought it might have been a simple mistake on their part, so I ordered two more pairs-- again, the leopard-print glasses arrived. The correct glasses look awesome, but good luck receiving what you order. I'm sending them back and going with another seller."
4,Giving it four stars because price is so low.,"Ok, so obviously these are NOT real Wayfarer sunglasses and they make no pretense at being so. Aside from the all plastic construction, I have been VERY satisfied in using these as a ""backup"" pair when I am unable to locate my genuine Bosch and Lomb Wayfarers. For the price on offer you can't beat this deal. Also, they came with an adequate cover."
4,Great sunglasses,"For the price, you can't beat these sunglasses. I have worn them daily for a while now, they look great and do a good job. You would never suspect by looking at them how low the price was. Well worth the money."
3,Wayfarwe Glasses,"just wanted to let people know that the glasses arrived as promised, however the lenses were very large for this style. I ordered the black ones from another seller on amazon and they had a much smaller lense. So unless you have a large head these might not be for you."""
3,Decent shades.,These are cheap plastic. They are very dark so they block out the sun just fine. The tortoise shell is a bit darker than the picture would lead you to believe but they still look good. They would be very easily broken but they work just great for what i use them for.
4,Love the cat eyed glasses,I got these cause it looks like glasses that Audrey Hepburn would wear and I love the cat eyes!! Very classy!!
1,Way too big,I ordered these and another pair sold as the blues brothers style (in black) the others fit much better. I also tried on a pair of Raybans at a local store. These were 20 times the cost but the fit and look were amazingly better. I literally threw these away they were so big.
5,Awesome!,"I am beyond satisfied with these sunglasses. They are EXCELLENT quality, especially for the price. People don't believe me when I tell them I only paid $5 for them. The lenses are dark and the tortoise pattern is nice. The frames are slightly large, but I have a tiny head and they look fine on me -- no one really notices. I've dropped them a ton of times, me being extremely clumsy, and they don't have even a scratch. I say get 'em, and if you don't like them, you didn't really waste much money..."
2,Came with one side loose,These sunglasses came with a loose screw right out of the box. and the side soon fell off. The sunglasses have a good feel and the tint is just right. but this pair did not come in the mail in good condition.
5,Wayfarer Sunglasses,"Very cute sunglasses! They are a little big but I like mine that way, also came with a protector bag case that I like. I was VERY satisfied woth this item!"
4,A good read for those thinking of making a change,"Arron's thesis is simple: Law today is a beastly profession, and that is why some of the best and brightest are getting out. This is part self-help book, part career guide. A lot of the feelings these people experienced such as ridicule and incredulity from families and co-workers are explored in detail. Finally, each person who's profiled in the book talks about how and why they changed to their current job.I found it extremely informative, and the appendices were filled with URLs of websites that talk about changing from a legal career to another field. I highly recommend it."
4,A Dramatic Commentary,"Swanson is a very creative writer! His commentary is a one-of-a-kind attempt to give the presentor of St. Luke's Gospel (preachers or those who want to present the text as a drama) ideas about how to approach doing this. As is the case with many commentaries written to help preachers with creative ideas for their coming sermons, some of Swanson's approaches are very helpful; some are not. We each go about preaching the way we do it. In addition, Swanson has translated St. Luke's Gospel, reading the Jewishness of Jesus back into our English langauge text (for instance He is called Yeshua). It is good drama, but I don't see many congregations capable of handling his translation. His commentary follows the readings, Sunday to Sunday, from the Revised Common Lectionary (RCL). It is a good resource for preachers who follow the Christian Year, and not so good for those who don't."
3,Abandoned Child Finds Home Again,"Young Clay Garrity has been left behind. His father lost his job and left the family, including his pregnant mother. Now, for whatever reason, his mother has also left. Clay must deal with living on his own in fifth grade. He stops going to school and spends a lot of time scared and lonely. Another family moves into his apartment, and he has no place left for himself. This is a realistic tale of what it might mean to be a homeless kid in a big city. No bad language, and Clay does some growing up.Might open the eyes of spoiled children that another, sorrier world exists, and that the homeless are people too."
3,A book about having no parents.,Hi man! Do I have a book for you! Do you want drama and excitement? Then I have the book for you. This book is called Monkey Island by Paula Fox. It's about this boy named Clay. His mom and dad left him for no reason. Clay was both mad and afraid so he ran away to look for his parents. Then he meets up with these two guys named Calvin and Buddy. He ends up living with them in a cardboard crate. You won't believe what happens next. When I read the book I could not stop worrying about Clay. This book is for ages 10 and up.
3,A book that will change your mind about homeless people.,"I read the book Monkey Island by Paul Fox. It is a very good book. It is a book about a eleven year old boy whose mom left him all alone at their house. The boy's name is Clay. Clay stayed at his house waiting for his mom and dad to come back. When they didn't come back, Clay became a homeless boy. While out in the streets he met two people , Buddy and Calvin . They befriended him. I can't tell you any more. It is your turn to read the book. You will learn something from this book. I learned don't judge people by their looks because they might be very nice. Also, I learned we should all be helpful for the people that need more money.I can tell you if everyone helped the homeless people our world would be a better place to live where every person had food to feed themselves and their families. So read this book and see if it changes any of the things you thought of homeless people before. I tell you it will change something."
4,A book about friendship.,"The book, Monkey Island, by Paula Fox, is a wonderful book. It is a book that leaves you waiting to find out what happens next. It is about a boy named Clay who is homeless. He starts living with two elderly men, Buddy and Calvin. Clay wants to find his parents badly. They left him at a hotel when he was eleven years old. If you think that a homeless person is just a dirty, worthless person, this book, I guarantee will change your thoughts. I recommend this book for fifth graders and up."
5,sweating,this game is allsome not only you get to be a jedi and blow stuff up but you can be a clone and all these other charecters . the only problem is that you get dehidrated relly esily and you swet allot . but its still probubly the best game ive ever played (ps i have allot of games)
1,returning it,This game is very machine specific..I ordered it for my grandson's birthday and have to return it because the Mac at his house is not the right one for this game. A great disappointment. The technology exists to make things more diverse & be compatible with many computers...this game isn't.
2,way too much,When you first open up the game it is a thrill. THe kids love identifying their favorite characters and the sounds are the genuine article straight from the movie's soundtrack. But the game gets complex quickly and the frustration level soon rises. Add to that the ease of use and the constant presence of enemies and the kids end up spending way too much time just in fights. And what kid can resist a light saber? The net benefit of this game is minimal.
2,"son loves the game, but i am not impressed","the game itself is fine, provides hours of fun to the kids, and is a central magnet to all the boys that come to our house for playdates.the turning on the game is a pain, pausing and going back and stuff is just not graceful. whoever wrote the software needs some good spanking. my husband is a software architect and i was a software engineer. it's a pain to get it to run right and it has too many annoying bugs. when the game is paused too long, it messes up the screen display which has to be shutdown and restarted to have the right display. maybe it has something to do with using this on a mac instead of pc, but it claims to be a mac version."
1,Rees Shad Band is a waste of money and ears.,"Anderson Ohio is an extremely boring album, and a waste of your time and money.Rees Shad is a talentless rich boy and his music proves it. Even millions of dollars spent on promotion has proven that he is a talentless yodeller from cow-pie county. He is a self professed story teller, and nobody is interested in his boring accounts of living life off trust fund money.The music is poorly recorded and his voice is abrasive and out of tune.There is absolutely no redeeming value to this worthless piece of junk.Do yourself a favor and save your hard earned money and dissapointment and don't condider this for your music collection."
4,Note that they are end-threaded.,"The rods I received are threaded at one end only. Not a problem, I can easily thread as much as I need. But it might not be what you need. They were nicely packaged in a sturdy cardboard tube and shipped in a box.(The ""toy"" ratings are meaningless, but Amazon requires them to register the review. It appears that this is a hobby item, rated as a ""toy"". My need for the rod stock is not for a hobby.)"
1,Only threaded on one end,No where in the description does it mention that these are only partially threaded. I ordered these because I didn't have a 4-40 die. On top of that they were somehow mailed to the wrong town.
5,"Great, especially during a power outage","Does its job, which is #1! This product works, and turns on during a loss of power. The only change to this product would be to have LED's go on so you can find it (or it provides minimum lighting during an emergency), then you can selct Xenon or Halogen mode. My streamlight, that looks like a mag lite does this. Over all it is great and we bought a lot for work."
2,"Not so ""Kinki""","This book had received alot of acclaim, but I look at it more like the emperor's new ""Kimono"". It's a more , in depth ""Berlitz book. It skim's over some of the richness of Kansai-Ben (The Osaka,Kyoto & western Japanese Dialec), but never really gives you the all important cultural ties or background. It's a phrase book and not really worth the money that I paid for it, compared to other books I've purchased. If you're looking for an introduction, then this may be okay for you. But this was claimed to be an incredible tome that goes into the nuances of the language and is an academic star. Mr. Tse needs to spoend more time in the area.Okini"
4,Great Product,It works wonderful . You should try it out . It was hard product to find . Get it while you can !
2,Oog. A silly book,"This is more an inspirational book than a good source of juggling information. In common with many books of its kind, it stresses the (alleged) benefits of juggling skills while shorting readers on technical advice. Better to read a purely inspirational book if you need that, or a book on juggling technique if your interests lie that way."
4,excellent survey of Mughal military establishment,"This book provides a good description of the Mughal military and its role in the development and maintenance of the Mughal state. The only drawback is that, like all Routledge titles, it is quite expensive. Routledge caters to large academic libraries and has relatively short print runs. I wonder whether the other reviewer of this work has read it, since he refers to it as a novel."
5,The closest thing to seeing these two live.,"If you're looking at this, odds are, you already know Mike West and Myshkin. If you don't, I could tell you that Mike, who supplies half the songs on the album, is a brittish expatriate hillbilly, who takes it on himself to write quirky intellectual ballads for the banjo. Myshkin covers the rest of the musical bases with her half of the tracks, and tends to fall into a bluesy style. This album is the closest thing to seeing these two live, as they take turns playing each other's songs the same way they do in concert."
2,"Intersting book, but way out of date","There is not much I can say about this book. It is more a historical document with information, although very good, that is no longer possible to use.The reason is the methods are based on materials from a particular company that no longer exists.I wish there was materials like shown, as I bought the book hoping to find better processes that what I've been able to find today.Some restoration people disagree with the Klein method (although it is moot), but for china you are planning to use, or for a robust fix, it was a very good technique."
3,Scottish Coins by Donald Bateson,"This book represents a brief introduction to a very vast, and remarkably untouched subject of Scottish coinage. The illustrations, all in black and white are helpful as well as the text. However if you are looking for a authoritative approach, I would suggest the purchase of a Seaby or Coincraft volume on Scottish coinage as an accompaniment to this book."
1,Some metal just doesn't make it!!,I read a few reviews about this band and they sounded positive. Not what I had hoped for. This band just doesn't get it done. The music is second rate metal and the singer is boring. That's why you can get this CD for $1 brand new. This ones going to the local scrapyard!!
3,WHAT WERE THEY THINKING,"The first two games were good but then the next one was bad. Then there is this one!! Why the ""tigger"" anouncer? Why the stupid, annoying rap music? The camera angels are terrible too. I finally settled on the swing angle. No clinching and the fact that you cut the fighter so easily is not real. The game does have some cool stuff. The knockouts are cool. But overall the game is frustrating to play. You don't have that total feel that you are in control of your boxer like in the 1st two games. I only paid $15.00 bucks for it so I am not too upset. Had I spent $40 or more I would be pissed."
4,Best boxing sim out there,"Great controls! Graphics are sub par but the overall fun factor evens everything out. Analog stick mashers need not apply the computer will work you!.. But if you master the bob and weave you can unleash combos after combos. EA don't sit on your laurels though, this game is a little shallow fighter wise."
4,different but yet fun,first of all kellyb39 is real stupid and i mean that for the remarks that he made. anyway this game is different from previous boxing games. the all new punch mode is very fun. the only thing i dont like is when you knock your opponent down the way he falls i dont like that but over all the game is fun and very competative which is a step up from before. overall this game is fun with a couple of flaws you should go buy it. and the blacks are not taking over
2,Great game bad controls,If you like boxing and don't mind playing with the right analog stick on your PS2 controller then disregard this. I played the demo from OPM and it was a lot better than this game. Whenever you block the health meter on the other boxer goes up. The signature punches stink. But overall I guess the best boxing game $50 can buy.
4,Excellent game,"This game tops every game made for PS2 so far. I bought knockout kings 2002 and I hated it. You couldn't even throw body punches. So i went backwards to knockout kings 2001, but i didn't like that game either. The graphics were poor, and the gameplay was slow. Also, THERE WAS NO CREATE BOXER MODE! Finally something great came out. This game has everything you need to be satisfied with boxing. The graphics are top notch and the gameplay is realistic. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because i'm kind of picky with games. Here's just a few cons i found in the game.1. Not enough illegal moves (only headbutts)2. No referees in the ring3. Some of the knockdowns are silly looking4. No grapplingThat's all i found so far, otherwise it's a great game and i recommend it to everyone. Feel safe to buy it."
4,Were is Knockout Kings 2004?!?,"Fight Night 2004 was a very good game, What i like the most of the game was how realistic it was but the graphics for this game were really not good. Ps2 has slow processors and there is a glitch in the system that makes the graphics look like crap. I suppose the xbox version would be much better. What i hated the most of this game was that it didnt have enough boxers. Were is oscar de la hoya? were is fernando vargas? Were is vitali klitschko? were is acelino freitas? were is james toney? were is wladamir klitschko? were is manny pacquio? Were is all the boxers? Come on! knockout kings 2003 had more boxers which was much better this one had less boxers hardly even none they only had the good people like roy jones evander holy field"
1,To bad they don't let you give zero stars,"This is one of the wrost games I've played. Whoever came up with the idea to have the right analog stick as the punch control should be fired. It is the most idiotic and ridiculous system I have ever seen. They should have stuck with regular buttons. Also having you put the image of the ref in focus using the left and right analog sticks to get up after a knock down is plain dumb. Sure the graphics are great and there is all lot to customize your personal fighter with( almost to much), but that wont ever make up for crapy gameplay.In three words: This game sucks."
3,mediocre at best,not that good but not that bad either. its an ok game with strange appeal.its not addictive to play. but at the end you feel like this game is just trying to appeal to Hip hop kids without much saying from adults.i don't think its worth buying but i'm waiting till the new version comes out.
3,An improvement over KO Kings,"This game is the most advanced boxing game out there. Total Punch Control gives the gamer the most realistic feel available so far, but it has some quirks. When it comes down to the 'types' of punches you can throw, it's really no different than just playing a game that uses the buttons as opposed to the analog stick. Fighters fight flat-footed, as they do in all other boxing games, and fast jabbing/putting together quick combinations just doesn't happen. The ""rag-doll"" physics feature is great - no more animated knockdowns that physically make no sense. Another gripe is the hip-hop/urban feel added to this game. The game was intended to be a realistic sim of the sport of boxing - why not use real ringside announcers, etc.? The game has a lot of potential, but needs a lot of work to raise itself to the same realism levels of Madden, NCAA, and Tiger Woods."
3,"If you're new to Fight Night, this is good","I made the mistake of playing the newest fight night before going back to play this. I wanted to see how far they came. Anyway, this game is good if you're just starting out, create a boxer is awesome, some of the boxers get on my nerves, they run around the ring the whole fight, and it's like 'what's the point?'. I HATE, absolutely HATE the way they have you toggle the analog sticks to get up if you've been knocked down (you're seeing triple and you have to use them to 'focus' and bring the images into one) it's a pain in the you-know-what, but over all it's good."
4,Good Game,"I think this is a good game not perfect buy any means but well worth the $49.99 price unlike some games that are out there. I really wouldn't listen to the bad reviews about this game from other reviewers because they are totally untrue. The graphics are awesome, each real boxer looks exactly like their real life counterparts (expecially roy jones jr.). The all new total punch control feature is another great idea because it makes it more realistic but if you don't like it you can always use the face buttons to punch. I know hip hop isn't everyones favorite music so its up to you if you like it or not but I like hip hop but some of the songs do suck. The career mode is a little shallow but thats basically the only thing I don't like about the game because its good but there should be more things you can do in your career. Overall its a great game not perfect but much better than knockout kings and I would recommend anyone who is interested in boxing to pick this game up."
2,Rent before you buy...,I couldn't stand the way the controls were setup on this game. I played this game for about a week until a huge blister formed on my thumb and I traded it back in for MVP2004.
3,It was fun for a day,"1. The soundtrack is limited to hip hop garbage; I thought they should have included a variety. I think the hip hop is probably realistic though since boxing is a ghetto sort of sport. 2. The detail of the arenas is very good but the actual boxing graphics leave something to be desired. The boxers have a rubbery sort of unrealistic look. 3. The level of detail provided for creating a boxer is outstanding. I was able to create a boxer that looked just like me! My friend was laughing when he saw it. Overall, the game is okay but I don't think great. It's the only PS2 boxing game I've played so I have nothing to compare to it though."
5,Impressive,I gave this to my boyfriend as part of his birthday present (he's a huge fan of the comic and the movie) and we were both very impressed to see the size and detail of the figure. I was very pleasantly surprised and would definitely recommend it to Hellboy fans!
4,Nice bracelets for a gift,"My friend loved this bracelet set - very inexpensive, but a nice gift and pretty beads."
5,Karizma Lineup Pops the Lid,"Carlos Vega on drums. David Garfield on Keys. Mike Landau on guitar. Phil Perry on vocals. AND A BUNCH OF THEIR FRIENDS PLAYING WITH THEM.Enough said.The compositions are SO AWESOME. You gotta watch the movie, too."
1,Shoddy,"MADACY's double-dip gray box VHS series is one to be avoided.Recorded at SLP speed, each VHS contains a smidgen of tape. Transfer quality of stressed film stock is pretty bad, so is tracking, and when you factor in the space wasted by these two-tape sets, it all adds up to junk bin rejects.Not worth it!Best advice to anyone still purchasing videotape: try to locate studio releases or at very least labels that you are certain record at the SP mode."
2,Dated Book,"Although offering some good ideas, the thoughts and stories in this book are dated some 20 or 30 years. I read this book as an assignment for a seminary class and got a little from it but still thought that this type of book needeed to be updated. Might be a valuable idea if this thought process was being examined from an historical perspective."
1,an abuse of reason,"I thought that von Mises here is using the narrow minded dogmatism that he professes to be against. In omnipotent government he says that he is against polylogism, but this whole damn book was polylogic. He doesnt seem to allow for the possibility that socialists have mistaken ideas or just disagree on how society SHOULD be run, which is exactly the same thing that he blamed the socialists of. Mises morally was a utilitarian, and if he had taken the time to familiarize himself with the teachings of Bentham(the founder of utiliarianism), he probably knew Bentham was not the firm believer in the rule of law that von Mises professed to be. Bentham favored stuffing people into poor houses, so that they would be out of sight and out of mind. Of course, von Mises was included in the happiness for the great number, provided that he happened to be included in the greatest number and we could fudge the fact that the rule of law could be abandoned in pursuit of this endeavor."
5,"Anti-this, Anti-that","Ok, now that someone has written a book called ""The Anti-Capitalistic Mentality"", I hope someone writes a book with the title ""The Anti-Socialistic Mentality"". Either way, ""anti-attitudes"" are trite."
3,Kind of works...,"This little Mitt does somewhat of a decent job on my stainless steel refrigerator and it takes away smudges after a little work. It doesn't work right away though with a little muscle work you can get most of the smudges off. Directions are to wet one side, wipe the smudge off, then dry with the reverse side of the mitt. Don't use too much water or the reverse side might become wet before intended. It isn't bad at what it does though I would of liked something that didn't require so much effort."
4,cleaning mitt,"Overall, pleased with the performance of this item. It is a great way to clean stainless steel without having to use messy cleaning liquids and can be done when you only have a few minutes."
5,Simplehuman Sponge Mitt for stainless steel,"This mitt works great on cleaning smudges, fingerprints and other smears off my very expensive stainless steel refrigerator and other stainless in my kitchen. Very quick, easy and long lasting mitt. Recommend very highly to all. Am coming back to buy more for Christmas gifts."
3,"Works OK, but takes a lot of elbow grease","Was a little disappointed in this mitt. It works fine on plain stainless, but on the brushed or textured finishes it takes way too much effort. Nice idea, but not for all stainless."
5,These textbooks of Informal Japanese should be as mandatory as the textbooks of Formal Japanese.,"Superb. This is THE resource if you want to learn casual Japanese. Polite and casual Japanese are both crucial to learning the language. Regular textbooks (like college textbooks, ""Minna No Nihongo"", ""Japanese for Busy People"", etc.) will teach you polite Japanese. But ""Japanese the Manga Way"" will teach you casual Japanese.WARNING: This book is not really for beginners. Unless you already know all of your kana and beginner Japanese grammar, the topics won't click past page 100."
4,"Great conversational Japanese, if on the beginner side","I give the format an A+. You get the actual manga strip, it written out in kanji, hiragana and romanji, a literal translation, a colloquial translation and a very detailed explanation. Nothing could be better for learning spoken japanese.My only complaint is that this book is (not surprisingly) geared towards the beginner. I started the book on page 180. But, even so, I think the whole book could be used for learning new vocabulary and kanji even if the grammar doesn't ever get too complicated. Not sure if there are higher levels of this book but I'd love to check them out if so."
2,Not as helpful as it may seem,"This book presents you with wide range of Basic Japanese grammar. All the material presented can be found in all of Japanese grammar books. The only difference is that the examples of this book are taken from the manga directly. However, only few examples are given to each grammar point which might makes understanding it difficult for beginners. If you want to read manga, you had better find another book that explains more advanced topics in Japanese grammar, and a text that explains the variation between standard Japanese and spoken Japanese."
2,What?!?!?!,I am very confused by this book. When I first got it I thought of it as they would teach you the basics like hello how are you my name is i am _years old. Then time and date then colors but no it starts off wiht pointless saying like there's a fire.
3,No sound DVD,"I have waited months for this cd as I look forward to any Shirley Bassey release. She is absolutely the best. I ordered this cd for myself and a few extras for friends. The cd is great, the DVD picture is great- however, there is NO SOUND on any of these DVDs no matter what DVD player we have tried. I have exchanged them and even the replacements do not have sound. I have never had any problems with a DVD for all of the years I have been buying them. Is there some trick to playing this DVD or is there something wrong here?"
4,Not too bad!,This walker isn't so bad! My six month daughter has been using it for quite some time now. I have to agree with the comments regarding adjusting the walker. There are only two settings. My daughter started holding her head at an early age so I would sit her in the walker for short periods of time. I didn't want her legs hanging so I placed a firm pillow under her feet. That solved the problem. My daughter is now 26 inches long and she is able to touch the ground. She is able to push herself backwards now and is learning to go forward.
1,do not buy,my grandson is over 27 inches and still cannot reach the floor. We picked up another walker at a garage sale and he has been in that one for two months now and is in the second going on third height adjustment.
2,Wrong proportions,"Even though it is great to stick my 9 month old in if I have to do dishes, his feet STILL dont touch the ground on the lowest setting. He is over the 50% in length, so I dont understand what the deal is. We bought it when he was six months. We should have taken it back....."
1,HORRIBLE,I got this as a gift for my 4 month old and he only likes the light on it. It looks cheap and he doesn't even come close to touching the ground. Spending a few more bucs is way worth it....
4,Great Walker for the price,My 6 mo old daughter really enjoys this walker. She cruises around backwards (not yet learned to go forwards). The trays move off to the side to make way for an empty tray underneath. The only thing I wish now is that I would have bought one without all the toys. I know eventually she'll get bored of the toys on it. But for now she's having fun and that's all that counts.
3,Safe &amp;amp;amp; Fun,"We received this walker as a gift and my son loves it! He is almost 7 months and kind of rough so he hasn't had any problem pushing the dinosaur to get it to play music and light up but, they definitely could have made the music much louder, you can barely hear it. The height could also be an issue with younger babies, they definitely need to change the age on the box or add a lower adjustment because it is just right for my son now and he is way above average in height and 3 months older than the 4 months stated on the box. Otherwise, this is a great walker. My son loves the toys it came with and I like that I can open the tray and give him his snacks and unlike other walkers and bouncers with fabric toys, this is so much easier to clean when he slobs on everything from teething.... you just wipe it right off. If you plan on purchasing this item, see if they have an in-store display first, just so you can make sure your baby is tall enough."
5,Great history book.,"This is a great journey through time and even comes with recipes, but none of them apply to the US since we never really used it for medicine like the rest of the world did. I recommend this book for anyone interested in Medical Cannabis."
4,mysteriouse museum,it is great movie Adrian Neil is great actor. my children loved the video . it is great stroy I recomend it to all video Libraries.thank you for the makers of the stroy and the video. special thanks for Adrian Neil
4,We'll see how well they work out,"The description said "" No drill application "", but it does not say that these are the 'peel and stick' application type, Not the 'inside the window channel' type. Need to be careful in the application to make sure you set them at the same height on your window frame. Easy application tho, clean the surface with supplied alcohol swabs then peel and apply - good, easy directions. The only reason I didnt give them 5 stars was because I just put them on and have not seen how well they will hold out the rain, there are small gaps in the tape and some rain might leak thru at speed. Also I dont know how high heat will affect the long term adhesion to the vehicle. Also - be advised, these are designed to stick to the vehicles paint so you should have a clean application area, if there is rust or deterioration of the paint in the areas around the window the tape will not stick as well. Fits my 04 Hyundai Santa Fe fairly well."
2,TINSTAAFL,"No free lunch & you get what you pay for...is that the verdict on this product?Well, the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it. I need disc binders and the Case Logic brand, while being the original, is pricey. Low cost alternatives are needed, but not at the expense of quality and TCO (total cost of ownership). But the flap about poor customer service (rebates) and poor quality (zippers and sleeve binding) is enough to give me pause..... So, if someone from Xtreme's management is paying attention....fix it or be content to lose business. Price isn't everything to everyone in the markt for your product..."
4,Well Built Case,(...) It's exterior is very durable and the interior is built just like any other cd case. The only improvement I can see for this case would be if the pages were removable to aid in alphabetical filing without having to shift all of your CDs over each time you add a new one. It's tough to find CD cases that hold this many CDS and can still close without having to wrestle with the zipper. No wrestling required for this one.
1,Who wants a broken holder?,"We bought the 320 holder. The zipper broke within weeks! This means you can't carry or store the thing unless it's flat. So, basically the money we spent on it is in the toilet. Guess you get what you pay for. We'll be buying a quality case now."
1,Zipper also broke,"Bought this case about 3 weeks ago. Smelled bad and gave us headaches. Then the zipper broke, and it's not the kind that you can fix either. I'll also be buying quality cases from now on. I got lucky and the rebate arrived, unlike the other reviewers on other sites."
4,Good for the price,"The case itself is well constructed. Heavy nylon with good stitching. The sleeves leave a little to be desired - they are made of thin plastic. I am worried that with time they will start to split. Also, once one side of a ""page"" is filled, it's a little tricky to slide DVD/CDs into the opposite side. I would recommend this for the car or office - not for long-term archiving."
2,TB264DKO 264 Disc Case,"(...)It has a lot of slots to put in your cd/dvd, but once it get full, the case became stuffy and hard to close, or even search around to find the cd/dvd that you are looking for."
1,Zipper is horrible,"I have never EVER encounter a zipper as bad. The zipper alone merits this case a 1 star review. I would've given it 2 stars because it still holds my DVDs whether or not it was agitating to even get into it, however the zipper broke and now it's partially useless since I can't carry it anywhere without risk of discs falling out."
1,Xtremely no good!,"The zipper is a key component to make a cohesive dvd wallet and without it all the structure falls out of the book when held by the handle. I'd have to agree, that this is by far the worst product in existence of dvd wallet products and one would have to simply be a fool to purchase one."
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"This is the worst dvd case I've ever bought. The second month I had the product the zipper ripped and now it won't zip. My boyfriend, the McGuyver that he is, tried to fix it but glueing the fabric part of the zipper together, but now it's connected but won't zip! Plus, the sleeves won't stay in the case.In summation nothing in this case works. The whole point of it is to hold and carry my dvds efficiently, but in the end it causes more work."
1,Xtreme TB264DKO 264-Disc CD/DVD Case - rebate problem,"I also bought this item. Sent in all of the required documents, including original UPC. Rebate denied because UPC was not included. I emailed them 3 times stating that I did in fact enclose it . Also quoted the number from the copy of it that I retained. To date, have heard nothing from them. I have now filed a complaint with the Texas Attorney General, and will follow up and file with the better business bureau and the FTC.Jim"
2,Finally got rebate,"I had all the same rebate issues with this item as others, so if you are buying this CD case just because of the rebate, please DON'T. I did finally receive my rebate, 4 months later after a second mailing in and irate email. I just cashed the check and I'm crossing my fingers that it actually goes through! The product itself seems okay. I can see if you use it a lot that the zipper might break, but I rarely get into my CDs so I haven't had that issue yet. However, I do not plan to ever buy from this company again because of all the rebate run around. A very dishonest company if you ask me. Good luck to everyone else waiting for a rebate!"
1,No Cash Back Here!,"Please don't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised! To date, I've been denied twice. The second time they said the U P C number was invalid. Only, it's the original U P C barcode! I was meticulous filing the paperwork, yet they state, ""All required products were not submitted."" Meanwhile, I have phoned AMAZ0N to lodge a formal complaint.The product itself is average. I've used better and worse. That said, it's definitely not worth the full asking price."
4,A classic of Southern California railroading,"Cajon Pass in the 1940's to 1960's was the mecca for many railfans (and still is). This classic by the late Chard Walker, who will always be associated with that golden age, was recently reprinted."
4,Lost in laughter,"I dont know where any bad reviews are coming from. I sped through this page turner laughing like a hienea. The plot is more far fetched then unbelieveable. It could happen. Thats what stories are for, right? Someone elses imagination is us readers entertainment. This book is not deep or very complicated. It is light and funny. Its not all about lust, it is more how men and lust equals love. A man who does not admit to what he really feels, you know the hard headed, cant look deeper then the surface type who run when things start going somewhere. Only he cant run. Cant do it. So, it is interesting to see how she is going to get out of her situation. And what is he going to do, considering what he knows. Dont go in expecting Linda Howard or anything. This is alot lighter, more like knee slapping funny. So its worth it. I enjoyed it and will read more titles under this author. A nice excape for sure."
4,"Good, Sexy Fun!","In my opinion, Sheridon Smythe specializes in fun books that are sexy also. When you are looking for a fun book to read, pick this book up. I loved this heroine's bigger-than-her temper."
2,Unfounded Specualtion on Nearly Every Page,"What a strange book. Meticulously researched, well though out, flowing narrative.The problem: every other page contains a ""Kennedy must have thought . . . might have felt . . . could have believed . . . may have . . . perhaps . . . possibly . . . maybe . . . conceivably . . . etc. etc.""No kidding, someone go through the book page by page and count these speculative qualifiers. Must be hundreds.To say it is distracting does not quite capture the effect.To say it is shoddy and amateur is completely accurate.A very fine book ruined with the silliest and most persistent kind of authorial arrogance - it was truly insulting to the reader to be slathered in this kind of goopy waste.If it hadn't overrun the book, I would have given it 4-5 stars.As it is, it ruined the book.Too bad."
1,I Despair,"I was so looking forward to listening to this book and so frustrated with the outcome.That part that I did listen to was written well but read poorly. Attempting to mimick the voice of Kennedy (and others) grows so old so quickly one would have thought it would have captured the eye of an editor sooner rather than later. But never? Alas, apparently that was not in anyone's job description.If you must do anything buy the printed version."
2,A scandalous book!,"This book deserves 1 star for what it contains, but there are a few cute and rare photos of Bob, so I put two stars to this book. The writer distorts the truth and even invents some stories! I've got 30 books about Robert Kennedy and this is one of the least good ones. I you want to know the TRUTH about Robert Kennedy, buy ""Robert Kennedy and his time"" by Arthur Schlesinger, it's the best about the subject, otherwise check ""a common good"", ""the Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys"" and many others."
3,not very good,this biography is a little bit boring and there are false informations. there are a few photos.
4,A More Complete Picture of RFK,"One word sums up this book---- balanced. It is neither a Kennedy worship book nor a Kennedy diatribe. As a close follower of politics and the Kennedys for many years, I did learn some new things, including RFK's intense personal involvement in plots to overthrow Castro and his lingering guilt that this may have led to President Kennedy's assassination. The book also debunks the myth that RFK and JFK were personally close to each other. While JFK did rely on his younger brother's keen political skills, their personalities were so different (JFK, cool and aloof and RFK, intense and passionate) that their relationship seldom went beyond business. I have enjoyed Evan Thomas's writing for some time, as a reader of Newsweek and his clear prose in this biography does not disappoint"
3,Nothing like a good dictionary,"I needed a dictionary with [etymology] brackets & the newer dictionies don't seem to promote word history, go figure! I'm not a huge fan of Webster's newer dictionaries for that reason so I deceided to get an older one. Etymology tells the story behind a word and allows me to make sense of things. I would say it's a good buy so far..."
3,Name Brand For Less & One Problem,I wanted the ACE brand and even the largest discount chain store was about $10.00 so I saved a few dollars with free super saver shipping. The only downside is that this only has Velcro on one end so be advised that a lot of the non name brand have Velcro on both ends which is much easier not having to fiddle around when you need it. If ACE put Velcro on both ends I would have rated it much higher but the price is right for name brand if you don't mind the Velcro issue. I wish they would add this to the description for all of the bandages so I'd know.Next time I will try to find one with Velcro on both ends but I don't regret it for the price.
4,"Good support, velcro could be better","Ace puts out trustworthy products, and this one does what it says. I wrap two around each thigh before sports to prevent hamstring injuries. They stay put and do good work without those annoying hooks. However, the velcro strip in a bit thin and does not hold under pressure. To remedy this, I tuck the velcro under another layer of the bandage, and it stays. I use these twice a week and buy new ones every three months or so. I prefer them to a neoprene thigh sleeve which slips down my leg when I perspire."
3,Wrong one.. bah,"Bought this thinking it was for the 4 door crew cab.... My fault. It was for the extended cab or the like. The back window covers didn't fit. Grrrr It said it fit my truck, so I bought it... just be careful when you buy it. The front vent covers fit wonderfully, and I've had no issues with them."
4,Book Review,"Easy to understand and Masters spends time discussing the induction and i found that quite helpful. Very good, imaginative, scenarios at the final chapters!"
4,biollante plush review,"Biollante is a good toy. The tendrals move in a good way. the Detaling is good. It shoudent be a collecters item.It should be played with. Only one complate,The tendrals dont have a mouth."
5,the best reciprocating saw out there,This is without a doubt the most versatile reciprocating saw I've ever had the pleasure to use. It's also well built.
4,Fun Christmas story,"Christine talks to children about Christmas, ""I like everything about Christmas, don't you?"" she asks. Christine proceed to tell all the things she likes about Christmas. Each page ends with, ""But that's not the best thing about Christmas."" The repetition will have children reading along. The book ends with the story of Jesus and the with the best thing about Christmas."
1,Manipulative religious propaganda,"My mother in law gave this book to my nephew and, although well intentioned, I could not see past the sinister hidden implications of this book. Instead of teaching children about the celebration of christmas, being with family, and the traditions of the holiday, it focusses solely on the religious significance of the day. It does not mention the traditional celebration of the winter solstice that has existed since prehistory that Christmas developed from. Moreover, it presents the story of Jesus' birth as a factual truth when it's only a religious belief. A good childrens book should teach them to be inquisitive, not accept stories based on faith alone, and most importantly be historically accurate."
5,Sturdy,"These are heavy duty hooks and I installed a pair of them on a huge barn sliding door. They work great to keep the wind from banging the doors around and would be a good security option (of course you need a separate door to exit from after you lock these up).If you're not familiar with turnbuckle hooks, you anchor one eye and the attached turnbuckle to the barn and the plain single eyelet to the door making sure they can reach each other with the turnbuckle half open. Then when locking the door, hook the turnbuckle into the eyelet on the door and turn the barrel of the turnbuckle until it is hand tight and repeat on the other side. This would only work for a single sliding barn door, not a double that met together in the middle because there would be nothing to anchor the turnbuckle to in the center of the doorway."
5,Action,The whole series is great. Lots of action with a very good story line. Amust if you like Vampiers and Lycons!
1,the digital copy is a JOKE,"the movie is 'ok' but the digital copy doesn't work with itunes, requires you to install some microsoft BS software to STREAM, and the usability of their website and explanations are sorely lacking. I will NEVER buy another sony movie again because of this ultraviolet rip-off digital copy. Stick to traditional digital copies that are not made by sony. Thanks for the frustration."
1,Way to Ruin the Series Guys,"Absolutely terrible. The graphics, scenes and acting were all awful. Not only that, but what ever a-hole was in charge left it open for another one to come out, I am sure only to be worse. Do not waste your money or your time. I want to kick all but one of the directors and producers in the crotch, the last one I would just light on fire."
1,Under the world undeniabley poor,Hold your nose when you watch this one PU No return of main Caricature at least have a replacement nope. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
2,Felt like a rehash,"This movie, while well produced, feels like a rehash of all the other Underworld movies. You could almost interchange some of the scenes with the last two Underworld movies and it wouldn't show. Perhaps the director for the next installment can just piece together moments from all the movies and call it ""Underworld Recollections."""
3,why did it end like that????????,"this movie was great until it go to the end. A very dissapointing ending indeed. I must also say the way it ended you kind of knew it was going to end, but in your mind your like this cant be it.....only to realize you were unfortunately correct. This movie is only worth about $5. Thats only because Kate is smokin hot."
2,Lackluster And Utterly Forgettable.,"What's with all the 5 star reviews? Are these people middle-schoolers or production/distribution company lackeys?I'm a fan, but this new addition is an embarrassment to Len Wiseman's brainchild and Kate Beckinsale's talent. After the first 15 minutes, it becomes obvious that this is nothing more than a revenue generator. The writing had flashes of brilliance, but it means nothing when the directing and overall production is amateur. I was optimistic that the quality would be on par with past installments, but I was wrong. Very disappointing to one of my favorite franchises and I sincerely hope a 5th addition is axed to save from adding insult to injury. Len, what happened???"
2,Horrible,"Wow horrible sequel; almost stopped watching but, I will watch anything so I finished it. Plus I did pay to rent from amazon. The first was the best but even the second was leaps and bounds over this one."
3,"Not great, but not horrible either","As it is, I have a problem believing humans can overpower supernatural creatures like vamps and werewolves. But these vampires seem to be very weak. They've come off weak from the very first movie. It would appear that the only strong vampire in existence is Selena. Having said that, without giving too much away...Spoiler:It made more sense to me that this was actually a movie that kept with its tradition of vampire vs. werewolves and not both vs. humans. It was interesting to see the werewolves in control, getting the upper hand, but the story lacked a substance. There was hardly any meat on these offered bones. I would have liked to seen more vampire/werewolf interaction, instead of the story revolving solely around Selene and the ""special vampire"" child. I think an additional 30 mins added to flesh out the story more would have did this movie some good."
2,"Move Along, nothing going on here","I wasn't expecting much and that was a let down.The first TWO Underworlds were fun, the 3rd was ok, but this one just sucked.The story has absolutely NO surprises. The action lacked action and everything was filmed Dark Dark Dark, maybe so they could save money on their lack of set, action and story.At least Kate looked good.Very disappointed. If this was a food product, I'd return it for being spoiled and get my money back!"
5,Can You say Amazing?,"In all I love this movie! I'm obsessed with this franchise and Awakening fit right in with it's awesome fight scenes and the love story even though Micheal technically wasn't in it. I loved it I loved it I loved it. My only complaint was that it was WAY to short, it could have been so much longer :D That is all."
2,Like Watching Someone ELSE Play a Video Game,"I loved the first movie. I enjoyed the second movie. The third movie....If you think of it as watching someone else play a video game, it will be OK. Don't expect much in the way of plot or even dialogue. It is pretty, though. I'm happy I didn't waste theater money on it. It's pretty modest for an R-rated movie. The steam keeps all the naked parts covered. Plenty of violence--but not more than you'd see in a video game.Know what to expect and you can still enjoy this movie."
4,"All around entertaining, action packed film. A for the sequel","Underworld awakening doesn't have many flaws. It gives a short paraphrasing of early prequels to continue the underworld saga. The film includes humans now involved in the battle with some twists and turns of similar kryogenically frozen plots and more family members included. The movie basically mainly involves the camera following around kate beckinsale while others help her try to reunite with her love then her daughter. I did enjoy it, however I thought the film could have been longer and more detailed. It seemed they did not spend that much time on this movie but kind of made this as ""fast food"" film. With that being said I'm a satisfied customer with this rental. I look forward to the next one. thanks. Godbless~shauns movie review"
3,Like Father like Daughter,Plot was a little thin. The action was a bit boring with the usual slash and behead Lycans. Guess well have to see if baby makes three in the next movie when they catch up with Michael.
5,Loved It!,"Huge fan of all the ""Underworld"" series films. This one is such a fun ride. As always, this series is so much better a vampire/werewolf film series than anything out there. You will not be disappointed."
3,Love the series,I imagine there will be another movie that includes finding Michael. There was plenty of action. Beckinsale does a superb job as always
5,Fantastice Movie,"Loved this movie at the theater, even better watching it in the comfort of my own home. A must have for people who like this type of movie."
3,Underworld Awakening,"I loved the first three movies, but this one was a bit of a let down. Seemed rushed, plot was lacking, and whoever did Kate's makeup should be slapped (she was hot in the first 2, but looked like an old hag in this one)."
2,Awakening,I really thought the big werewolf was going to be much more than how it was portrayed. Where was the half breed vampire?... Why was he asleep during the whole movie? The writers and makers of this film missed a lot that could have made this picture more exciting and a better part of the series.
3,It Was Ok,"It was not nearly as exciting as the first 2 Underworld movies. I was really looking forward to this one, but was somewhat let down. Not enough action or story line. Too much time spent on the daughter character. Overall, disappointed."
2,Unboxing and Review Video Here,Go see my review video in the following link:[...]This movie was not my favorite in the series. In fact I thought it was poorly directed and it had no cinematic appeal. I got this movie for $14 from Amazon...anymore is a bit too much to pay for this movie.
2,Pointless,I believe that this movie was just pointless... There were very few action/horror scenes(compared with the previous movies) and the story line pretty much went nowhere. I have been a fan of the Underworld movies since the beginning but this movie was VERY diappointing! I was literally yawning throughout the movie!
3,It was OK for the series,"While I feel that this was just an OK addition to the series there was a lot of bad mistakes in making this film. To start off, when Selene escapes the cryogenic freezer she's made to be naked but, they CG'd her so much to hide her body parts that they just ruined the scene. It left me wondering why didn't they just have her wear underwear or something & instead of a far less fake looking let's pretend to be naked scene. Second, I think Michael should have appeared in the final battle to save the day. Last but not least, I don't think anyone liked the overly obvious open for another sequel ending. While it was enjoyable to watch, it added very little to the story & even less reason to wait for the next sequel."
1,Worst Underworld Movie!,"I'm a fan of the Underworld franchise. I found most of the films to be sleek, and stylish with amazing special effects, and of course, Kate Beckinsale as Selena is great. I even liked Underworld: Rise of the Lycans, the one that doesn't have Kate in it.Can't say I liked Awakening. The plot is lame, the acting is worse. All Kate/Selene does is kill lycans. Yawn."
1,Very disappointing,"Kate Beckinsale is back as Selene in a tight, black leather costume as usual. This is the best part of the movie. She is HOT!!!! The fourth entry of the ""underworld"" franchise is not enjoyable at all. The film has a very underdeveloped (being nice) storyline. You do not connect with any character including Selene, which is hard to accomplish since you know her back story. Action scenes are OK, but the film drags terribly when there isn't fighting. I kept waiting for the movie to pick up or end. It was unfortunately a contest that shouldn't be in your mind during a movie. Some of the story finally has a little more depth at the end but the clearest item was that there will be another one."
1,"Movie is great, UltraViolet Digital Sucks","The movie is a very good addition in the Underworld series. The disc release with UltraViolet Digital Copy is VERY BAD.Why change digital copies away from what works. You cannot store your digital copy on any computer, you have to have an internet connection and an account to watch you digital movie, no internet, no movie and slow internet, no enjoyment. Whoever decided to start using only UltraViolet must have been paid off by the UltraViolet backers."
1,stopped watching after 10 minutes....,this movie was so bad I stopped watching after about ten minutes.... the action scenes are second rate... special effects are outdated and obvious. I would really be mad if I would have paid to see this.
4,underworld awakening,"this was an alright movie. it had the same stuff in it as the rest of the previous movies. you had the expected vampire werewolf fights. the plot of week but, the action scenes were pretty good. if you have nothing else to do on a rainy day then watch it."
4,Vampire,I liked the movie but something in the story line was missing. Just did now hole up to the previous movies in my mind. Still great stunts and all that goes with it.
3,"Entertaining, but short","This is a non-stop action addition to the Underworld series, but it's a little short. I enjoyed the film, but am glad I decided to stream it rather than see it in the theater. It's too short and barely advances the storyline. I would have like to have seen a longer film that wasn't so thin on plot. Good, but could have been better."
3,Getting old......,Not as entertaining as the first ones were. The writers are evidently getting tired of coming up with new ideas for this series.
3,At least it sort of makes sense,"Unlike some others in this series, the latest installment - number 4 - is a relatively straight narrative, and mercifully short at 88 minutes. Non-stop shooting, stabbing, blood and gore, of course. That's par for this series, and you would not have gotten this far if you can't take it. But this one feels like part 1 of a two-part film, which they simply broke in two to make more money by putting out two separate movies. It ends before it really even gets going. The big mystery is what powers the little werewolf girl hybrid really has that she hasn't discovered yet. Well, you won't find out by watching this. The Lykans have evolved into huge dinosaur-like creatures by the ending here. The werewolves are almost all killed off. Their turn to rise again is next."
2,too bad,"This turned out to be a nothing show. Very little plot, not really much action either. I regret that I paid for instant video rather than waiting for the Redbox (only worth a dollar)"
2,Boring!,"Boring movie. Despite being a vampire/horror film fan, this new Underworld movie was so boring I had to stop it in the middle and not continue watching. Hughe disappointment!"
2,Not worth it,"There is very little substance to this movie. Rise of the Lycans was a far better film with an interesting plot which gave a backstory to the other films. This is just ... nothing. I couldn't even hate the villains as they were rather pathetic and not well fleshed out enough for me to get vested in them. It was great having Beckinsale back, but she was wasted in this film. The action was pretty good, but really this film is pretty light on everything else."
2,Lacking,"It seems that all the Underworld Movies are leading up to another sequel. Kate Beckingsale is undefeatable as always even against a giant silver immune Lycan. Yawn! The plot was predictable. At the end of the day, it was back to Vampires against Lycans and both of them against hybrids. It was okay for action with the usual gore in every other shot. Same old cliches...oh well, that is what is expected from the 4th installment of any series."
1,Terrible,"This movie was absolute crap...the whole 10minutes I watched the only thing that went through my head was...just shoot her and get it over with.Terrible story,terrible acting,it made my head hurt just trying to watch it"
5,Great movie!,"The movie has good story, and lot's of action. It's kind of like Blade movies, the first one was focused on the action and story and the second one was mostly about action. To me honestly this movie is better than the second part of the Underworld, Kate still looks hot as always, and is kicking butts."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"While there was more action in this instalment, there was absolutely NO character developement and very little plot.It's okay if you are just looking to mindlessly entertained for two hours. But the movie did very little to add to the story. It was more like it was just a set-up for the next movie.Eve's character was very disappointing. They did not develope her character at all. She went from a scared child to a powerful monster in minutes. You learned nothing about her life or who she is. Nor was there any developement of Selene's character. While we all knew that both were going to survive, this movie does nothing to make you care whether they lived or not.This seemed very much like just another run of the mill sequel put out to make money off of the franchise. If this was the first movie that I had seen in the series, it would also be the last."
2,meh,"Pretty weak story, been done before with other films. Pretty predictable as well. The acting was alright, pretty much Kate being the sole player in this whole movie."
4,Very Good,I hated that I missed this movie at the show. I have enjoyed all of the Underworld Series so far and this one was no exception. It was action pack and introduced apart of humanity that I never seen coming.
4,Vamps Kick A**,"She keeps faith with the previous movies, still a straight shooter. Wonder what her daughter will turn out to be?"
4,"It is what I call a ""wow' movie!",Just the first 15 minutes of this great horror/sci-fi movie will blow you away. Hold on to your beer/pop and popcorn or you will be wearing them!This movie has almost non-stop action throughout. It is also a great drama. Really neat how they were put together to make a fantasticmovie. The acting was surpurb. This is the kind of movie that can almost convince you that it could really happen. The next two sequelswere just as good. Can't wait to see the fourth release.
3,Ok,Not as good as previous too much violence without the good story running throughWould not watch again. That's it
2,Poor quality,"From what I could watch of the movie it was good but the showing of it was poor quality, the movie jumped and skipped all the way through it or it looked grainy"
3,Missed Scott Speedman,"This was an ok movie; however felt it could have been better. Wasn't real impressed with the daughter, didn't know what I expected but felt she should of had more personality."
1,Underword Awakening,"Will not play in my Sony Blu-Ray player, Have not been able to see movie and do not know what to do about it"
1,Was this release even necessary?,"I found this release to have no continuity with the previous releases if this was to be a continuation as there was not enough back story. I have been a fan of this franchise, but with this release, I think is has fizzled out."
2,what a rip off,"I can't believe I heard this was good. The characters were extremely flat and dull, aside from the super werewolf who gets maybe 5 minutes of screen time. Also the cop played by michael ealy, who is a great actor, was interesting at first, but quickly decides to be a from vampire supporter, killing his own kind in a mere instant. My least favorite part was the little girl. Talk about a dull whiny little kid---the same as any scared little kid you'd see in a movie. The only thing that gets this two stars is that the effects were good and there were some cool action sequences, however this is nothing special any more, and the sciences were not even all that memorable. A very big letdown compared to the characters and acting in rise of the lycans"
2,Underworld Awakening,"Excited about the release of the newest in the series, I quickly purchased the video Underworld Awakening.I became disappointed unpon viewing the film. It lacked newness and excitement. Not really worth the money."
3,very entertaining but too short,"I thought this movie had great action from start to finish (not to mention great sound and special effects), the only problem was the finish came way too quickly. An hour and 18 minutes is too short in my opinion, even for action movies"
3,Decent for a fourth entry,"I didn't really expect much from this film. Being that it is a fourth entry in a series that has gone through constant director/writer changes in the past and was in the hands of first time or relatively new directors, I was prepared for something like the terrible resident evil movies. But having enjoyed the last 3 I figured I would give this a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised. No it's nothing special or mindblowing but it is a decent way to kill a couple of hours."
4,Best looking Vampire,The movie gives the best treatment of the war between Werewolves (lycans) and Vampires. It includes a more powerful immortal than ihe parents and maybe more sequels.
3,Underworld Awakening,I like the series but this is probable the worst sequel. I still liked enough to recommend it. I'm not sure why but the movie appeared to be moving away from its original idea of two loners meeting and needing each other.
3,You won't get the movie Ultraviolet with this DVD,"You will not get a digital copy of the movie Ultraviolet with this DVD purchase, which is what I thought I was going to get. Apparently, UltraViolet is their term for getting a digital copy of the DVD you just bought. Why anyone would want that I haven't a clue. So, yes, you will get a digital copy of Underworld: Awakening, but not a digital copy of the movie Ultraviolet. Buyer beware."
3,"Special Effects cool, but movie is weak","I saw this movie in a Theater in 3D because I was told the movie was shot in 3D. This was an ok movie with average 3D effects. I saw Avatar in 3D and ths is no Avatar. In Avatar, you felt part on the workd. Here the3D effects seemed forced. The 3D Blu-ray rate the same. A buy for those who need to complete their Underworld collection. I would still purchase the 3D movie because it is rated farely high on a 3D delivery scale"
1,Just a really dumb movie.,Honestly one of the worst movies i've seen. Glad I didnt pay the like 18 bucks it cost to see it in 3D.
5,All Great So Far,"So far all of the Underworlds have been great movies to watch, I'm sure, well hoping that this one is as good as the others... One of my favorite warewolf and vampire movies out..."
4,Underworld Awakening,"As far as the quality,the disc and case were in good condition.The only physical problem was the case was a little warped.The movie is my favorite of the franchise.The original is a close 2nd to this one.Its filled with action and the story isnt complicated,its just a fun movie to watch.Must see if your a fan of the franchise."
5,Biodegradable,"Yes, in a way, it was just more of the same (minus a key character). Even so, I like that it does stick to its original blueprint. I like this series exactly because of the action and the characters and the creatures. This is the type of series I count on when I'm in the mood for mindless junk food. It's so satisfying as you watch it with nothing of substance to get in the way of all those empty calories. It's not deep, you don't have to ponder anything afterwards, it doesn't deal with important issues currently plaguing mankind; it's fun!I look forward to the next installment."
4,Kate in tight black...what more is there to say?,"Normally I'd be accused of leaning to the movies that have some theme or ideas and make one think. Think ""Bicentennial Man"" or ""Gattaca"" or ""The Matrix"". Really though, some movies are just fun to watch, have good acting and eye-candy effects, and get you rooting for the hero, or heroine in this case. This is one. The digital download is on my tablet and my PC as well. Easy to pass time watching this again. I'll be adding the earlier one's to my to-buy list too."
3,Its good !!,"Not the best of Underworld series, I found the movie short but very entertainment, I think this movie is for fans only !!!"
2,SO dissappointed,"I'm a huge fan of the 'Underworld' movies and was SO excited to see a new movie come out in this show but must say I was very disappointed. Just glad I never purchased the dvd before seeing it. What the movie lacked in story line they tried to make up for in violence. There is one scene where it actually looks like something out of the 'zombie' type video games you can play, I couldn't believe it. Kate Beckinsale is as always, phenomenal, but the movie is a real disappointment."
3,2.5 stars,"( I did NOT purchase this movie on amazon.com - this is moreless a film review)This movie was okay. It wasn't nearly as good as the previous ones. In my opinion The Rise of the Lycans was the best, but I'm not a fan of how the story line went. The whole '12 year old being a hero and then getting captured again and then the hero going back to save the 12 year old'. I'm not a fan of the injection lycan blood( when you see it, you'll know what I mean). That's..I don't know. It's not supposed to be like that in my opinion. It's either get bit or nothing. Simple as that. Hopefully the 5th one will return to the 2nd and 3rd film roots. I'll have to wait about 2 or 3 years to find out though. Personally, I'd rent it unless you can find it for like 3 bucks somewhere."
3,Product is fine!,Great condition and price but the movie itself is not good. They keep adding elements to expand the franchise and it is making things confusing.
2,flat 3d,the computer generated images are in good 3d but the human characters are flat. almost like a cut out. the movie itself is pretty good but since I purchased it for the 3d its definitely on the lower end of everything else we have purchased.
3,Series gets worse and worse...,"I use to love Underworld, well the first two movies. The 3rd and 4th just were horrible and not entertaining at all to me. Maybe I am just getting older and more annoyed, who knows.Decent movie at best however."
2,"Underworld Fan, not impressed with this one","I almost turned it off. I am not a movie snob, and I don't mind pointless violence. However, the rest of the Underworld series has had great story lines, AND great violence/action. This one has a VERY weak story, and mediocre action. You can tell that they didn't have as good of a budget for this film. All in all, it was ok at best."
4,Awesome Flick!!!,"I have been a fan of the series since the first Underworld. And this tale did not disappoint...well I miss the character of Michael but, I assume he'll be in the next one. Anyway, it's worth the rental and purchase...Enjoy."
4,Good Film,"The fourth story of the ""Underworld"" saga is interesting and in my opinion, just as good as the previous films in their own steads. I personally was more interested in the stories than all the visual gores, actions, and the killings, and the story of ""Awakening"" is just as interesting because of Selene's search for Michael after being in a frozen sleep for many years and ended up finding a girl with the similar abilities as Michael's. Admittedly, I would like to have Michael (Scott Speedman) back as a returning character. The dynamic between Selene and Michael was phenomenal in the first two films.In all, it's a great action-horror film."
5,Great Action Great 3d,Ready to watch it again! The action was great and the quality of the 3d was one of the best live action 3d movies on BluRay. If you like action and 3d then get this.
1,Disapointed,"Bored and disapointed, loved the other movies. First few minutes I thought ok, Im going to like this.. Paused the movie just about an hr into it and never finished the end. Pssh not interested!"
3,Glad it was cheaper on this site,"Not as good as I had hoped, but it was available for rent here, but not on Vudu.Not much added to the original premis."
4,Yep.,"I saw this movie in theatres, and though I'm not sure why, I liked it more than the other three. The same amount of action is present, though with a lot more gore than I remember from the previous films. Beckinsale doesn't disappoint as Selene, and the addition of new characters (especially Michael Ealy's) is refreshing for such a concentrated series. Some aspects are unbelievable, of course, but all in all, it's a fun, entertaining movie with just enough heart to make you want to know what happens next."
3,Way too short,Movie was too short and felt rushed. It could have used a better back story and plot. I hope they continue franchise though.
1,Item not received,"Item is yet to arrive, it is now 23rd and the package was supposed to arrive on the 18th, was hoping to have package before Christmas"
3,It's nice to have Kate Beckinsale back as Selene.,"A good premis, but how does a baby develop when your kept frozen? And mostly the daughter growls and looks scary and only at the end of the movie does the action get good. Charles Dance is very good as the coven leader. I hope they bring back Scott Speelman for the next movie, it's just not the same without their romance in the middle of all the hell!"
3,Can't compare to the beginning,"The movie had great special effects; however, the story content wasn't that great. It does expand the Underworld world for future movies and I think I'll probably watch them, but I'd say this is my least favorite of the movies."
2,The movie was enjoyable. The seller gave me an unusable ultraviolet code so it was unusable. So thanks for nothing.,"The movie was enjoyable, but not as good as the first three. I gave this a rating of two stars because the seller provided me with an unusable code to redeem the ultraviolet portion."
4,"Good, but not the best of the series.","Not a bad film. The story sets itself up for future movies, but still nowhere near the awesomeness of the first one."
1,This Vampire Movie Sucks...,Shortest review ever...UGH. A complete and utter disappointment. The 3D was only slightly less impressive than the dreadful storyline. Best advice? Give this one a miss.
4,Awakenings Awakens Franchise!,"I love this series. Every movie has been good. But the 3rd installment wasn't nearly as solid as the first 2.I think that is because the 3rd movie didn't have the same director nor actress/character of Selena. I still liked it, though.This 4th installment has the return of Selena and Michael, but not the same director. But these directors did a better job than the last, and the storyline and action was better. 31/2 stars to Awakenings."
2,Underworld,"I was upset that I spent my money on this rental. The movie was thrown together. I wish I would have read the reviews first, I love Kate Beckinsale and this was a waste of her time."
1,"3 to 4 for the Movie, UV Sucks",My wife and I thought the movie was a fill in for the next movie. Lots of action but lacking a good story.Why do I have to sign up with another studio to get my crappy UV digital copy. Half my digital copies don't show up in Flixster.
1,It can't be that bad......it is......don't do it.,"The plot is extremely shallow which is fine for an action movie, but you get an hour in and you are wondering why they even made this crap movie. Also, in every Underworld movie for something that is supposed to be more powerful than both vampire and lycans, Michael is always getting hurt/saved like a wuss (So annoying). Seriously, I had low expectations of this movie, and it sucks. I know he is your husband Kate Beckinsale, but tell him no already. Put a stake in the Underworld movies they are officially done."
1,Disapointing,"I don't see how there could possibly be a writer for this movie. There's just no way, unless it was the producer's grandchildren. Scott Speedman didn't want to do another one of the movies, and the producers could have very easily written him out, and made a great story line with Seline on her own again. Instead, the entire movie revolves around ""Where's Michael; has anyone seen Michael."" Seriously, that is the extent of the story line in this movie until the next cliche of a bunch of mad scientists creating a child between Seline and Michael is revealed.Especially with Kate doing this project, there were a lot of ways to go with the story that would have turned out really well. But anyone that writes a good review of this movie must be the same people that thought Schumacker did a good job with the Batman movies."
2,Worst in franchise.,"On the positive side the production quality was good, lots of action and Kate Beckinsale performance was impressive. However, this movie is the worst in the franchise. The plot was swallow and predictable. Dialog was cliche. And all the other actors were severely out classed by Beckinsale. This movie focused on the action and effects scenes and the script was merely to connect those scenes. The movie is fun to watch for the action and effects but nothing else. This was just a poor attempt to milk the franchise for more money."
2,Disappointing,"Up to now, I've really enjoyed the Underworld series. This one, however, is disapponting, to say the least. I agree with other reviewers' comments that the Lycans are cartoon-like, there is no plot development or exposition, the characters are caricatures, and the movie is too short to develop any story line. I believe the goal of any sequel should be to improve on the story and continue to develop the characters, rather than to simply exploit the popularity of earlier installments to make a buck. The door has been left open for another sequel. Let's hope it's better than this. I feel like I wasted my money this time."
2,its just an action movie,"This movie did absolutely nothing for me. I would enjoy watching someone else play a video game about as much as this. I admit, I'm not much into action movies. I guess I wasn't expecting this to be just that.. the story line was weak and uninteresting. It was a lot of noise, no story. I wish I could get my my money back about 10 minutes into it, and then after watching the whole thing I wanted that amount of my life back."
1,It was horrible,The only reason I finished watching this horrible movie is because I've watched and enjoyed the other Underworld movies and I heard there will be another movie. It was nothing more than a rickety bridge to a hopefully better sequel.
2,Really? A fourth installment?,"This movie is a black hole that sucks all of the joy out of a once decent franchise. Kate Beckinsale in bondage-ware cannot save this steaming pile. As some are fond of quoting main press reviewers, I would suggest a trip to the Rotten Tomatoes website, where this movie has a rating of 27%. That's not too far from, say, Ishtar at 19% or Transformers: Dark Side Of The Moon at 35%. So if you must put credence in mainstream reviewers, you might want to avoid this one. Just by chance I happen to generally agree with them when it comes to this movie.If you //are// successful at checking your brain at the door for this one, you are still subjected to plot holes, disappearing characters and a zombie-like walk through by the main star, who must have been paid a bundle to agree to come back to make this movie. They say good things come in threes - this is proof that adequate things also come in threes - this being the //fourth// installment."
2,The weak one of this series,"I absolutely loved the other Underworld films, but this one felt rushed, with poor story development, a bad pace, and some fairly terrible cgi graphics."
3,Pretty Good,I thought Underworld Awakening had some loops in it. The movie was a little unrealistic and it ended with questions of part 2.
5,underworld awakening,Great story line and great action. A must have for any fan of the series. Kate beckinsdale sizzles!. 3d version enhances what's already great.
3,Be Warned!,"Be warned that the ""ultraviolet digital copy"" can not be imported into Apple ipad or iphone devices, only your computer!!!"
3,"This movie earned three ""Meh...""s","Though the first two installments were short on story line and heavy on action, the thrd movie was even more so. There is really no further character development for Selene and the whole movie followed the formula: Action >> Segway >> Action >> Segway >> Action >> Inadequate Conclusion...I recommend waiting for the price to drop as this is not worth the whole $12 to purchase and isn't worth the probable $3.99 to rent."
1,Underwhelmed: Snoring.,"Underworld: Awakening reportedly had a slightly larger budget than any of its predecessors, which is bizarre since the FX for this film are of an astonishing direct-to-video quality. While the stories and scripts of the previous films were always appalling at least they APPEARED as though an absurd amount of money went into them. Yet I can't remember the other movies ever looking this awful. Where did the money go this time? Certainly not into the writing: it's even worse than before, if that's possible. Were the actors' fees so enormous? Was the 3D conversion so costly that the actual FX couldn't be bothered with? The only awakening that can be hoped for is that of the producers to the realization that this latest installment should be the last."
2,Very disappointing movie,"What happened to this movie is very similar to what happened with Blade Trilogy:after 2 great movies, the Blade:Trinity was released which totally killed the series. Underworld: Awakening has a very poor plot due to a probably very limited budget. Whoever liked the first 3 movies,I suggest you purchase the Trilogy on Blu-Ray and watch it in high definition-you will not waste your time and money and will be satisfied at the end. Don't waste a minute of your precious time on Underworld: Awakening or if you are a die-hard fan of the series- simply rent it. Trust me,you will want to use fast forward button after 10-15 minutes."
1,bitter tea,"I had such high hopes for this tea infuser but the product didn't deliver. It is very cute but I kept getting a ready odd flavor when I steeped loose tea. I probably tried the cup 10 times before I realized that it is the plastic giving the odd flavor. I can't even describe the flavor other than bad.Since I discontinued using the cup I have never experienced this bitterness again. BTW, I am still using the same tea and I still infuse in a plastic container but don't have this problem."
3,Hmm..,This would apply to all the other state quarters:Why would you pay $8 for 50c when you can easily get them from change at the grocery or any other store (presuming you're using cash)?
5,Wonderful!,"One of the treasured delights from my childhood, this book is still on my shelves. With the aid of a watermelon, long-suffering Benjamin finally comes to grips with his nemesis, Tulip."
4,Visually gorgeous,"This book was visually gorgeous-- everything I thought it would be. The photographs are stunning. I just wish the paper was of higher quality-- if the paper was high-quality gloss, the photos would have looked even better.Still a great bargain, I would buy it again as a gift."
3,Was surpised,Got this book and was surprised. Expected it to be high quality paper and pages and pages of high quality large photos of Adrian's work and the actresses who were lucky to be in them. I was dissapointed. This book is more for fans of Adrian as a designer and want to read about him. Not a substitute for an 8x10 photograph collection (in book form)like I was hoping for.
1,Dreadful,"This book is, at best, an insult to the intellect. As much as I prefer living on the East Coast, I found the contents of this book to be overly pessimistic, sullen and cynical. The copious references were obscure, the analogies were misleading, and the ""scholarly"" jargon was archaic.A perfect example of ""The Ecology of Fear"" is the amount of trees wasted to make this printed drivel. Unfortunately, though it was highly deserving, I could not give it less than one star."
1,Los Angels raked by Tornados?,"The author makes some spectacular claims that would make a good Hollywood movie, but make for bad science. One of the most ridiculous accusations is the ""Jewish"" media purposely under reports the number of tornados ravaging the LA area. Another ...claim is Winston Churchill wanted to use Anthrax on Nazi Germany during WW II.This book is very hard to stomach if the reader is looking for serious discussion on the topic of Ecology. The only reason I finished the book was to get a better understanding of how the environmentalist movement has been hijacked by radical elements."
2,"Amazon will not leave me ALONE, They have asked me to review over 5 times, I do not want to do a review ! LEAVE ME ALONE !","Amazon will not leave me ALONE, They have asked me to review this BOOK over 5 times, I do not want to do a review !LEAVE ME ALONE !GET A ^%^#@ HINT AFTER THE SECOND TIME I IGNORED YOU IT SHOULD BE CLEAR I DO NOT WANT TO DO A %@^%%$* REVIEW !LEAVE ME ALONE !"
1,Commie Talk,"I knew this writer years ago before he wrote his first book. I am here to say that this boy Davis is a commie. And if that is not enough to write off a book as worthless, I don't know what is!"
4,trademark Mike Davis material,"Not a sequel to City of Quartz, but a look at current and historical LA from an environmental perspective instead of Quartz's sociological view. Famous for its criticism as much as its content, Ecology Of Fear compiles a staggering amount of information into an informative and compelling story. LA's dynamism is a product of its people, land, water, air, wildlife, history, and future. This is the book that can tell you what life has been and will be like, for those who choose to live in the wilderness of Los Angeles."
5,"Kaleidoscopic, whirling, brilliant, disturbing.","What's bred in the bone will out in the flesh, and Davis' new book shows the bones, the the sinew, and the exposed nerve endings of a southern California about to spin apart. With a polymath's range and a poet's intensity, Davis spins his thesis from strands of discarded history, cast off cultural artifacts, and rejected flotsam from the collective and ecological unconscious.If you live in southern California, you must read this book. If you don't want your region to become southern California, you must read it anyway. Devoid of pablum, eschewing a 'feel-good' Strangelovian approach, Ecology of Fear shows how we move into and make our own hell, and casts an unblinking eye on some nasty, nasty truths. If Harlan Ellison had politics, this work would be his."
4,Eye-opening and thought-provoking,"I am a native Angeleno (currently living elsewhere). I read the Los Angeles Time article on the factual problems with the book, as well as the comments here. I really think that these criticisms are missing the forest for the trees--or lack of trees. For example, is Los Angeles a big, continuous, undifferentiate plain of buildings with little greenery or parks? Yes. Did it used to have rivers and greenery and the like? Yes. I don't know if the way it got from A to B is exactly like Davis says, but _something_ went wrong. My sister moved recently to the east coast, and I was amazed at how the natural environment has been better preserved there. There were hummingbirds and butterflies in L.A. when I was a kid--no more. What about more recent cultural assets? What happened to the Pan Pacific auditorium? The Ships coffee shops? The city is just a slash and burn politcal-industrial complex."
4,Catch Me If You Can,"Catch Me If You Can is a great book. It is about an 18 year old con-man named Frank Abnagle. He was an airline pilot, a lawyer and a doctor before he turned age 21. He also stole over 2 million dollars through counterfeit checks. This is a great book and also a great movie."
5,"Easy to assemble, but gives a hard work-out","The Stamina 45-1000A Manual Treadmill is one of the easiest exercise machines to put together. I think it took me less than half an hour, and I ain't very handy with tools and stuff. Because of its incline and because it's a manual treadmill, this guy will give you one hell of a workout. If you've been used to motorized treadmills, beware: this treadmill is gonna be tough on you. But you know what? It's what you need if you're serious about getting into shape!"
1,Order Cancelled,"My order was supposed to be being processed on May 29. My account was charged on May 31. On June 7, nothing had been done. Order not shipped. I cancelled the order."
3,Sterling Silver Wedding Band,This ring looks nice and shiny when you get it but after awhile it gets tarnished and it easily gets bent. It's nice for something temporary but I wouldn't recommend for long term.
4,Decent ring for the price,"I bought this ring for my ring finger actually and it's still too small, but it's the closest size I could find without having to go to an expensive jewelry store. I mainly use it when I go out without my boyfriend since I want guys who decide to hit on to leave me alone which has helped a bit for those who take notice. There's a few scratches on it from everyday wear but you can't expect too much from a ring that is inexpensive. It does the job it was intended for and looks nice since it doesn't have any gaudy jewels. Nice and simple without having to break your wallet."
5,Great!,"I wanted a band to wear on vacation because I didn't want to take any ""real"" jewelry with me. I'm allergic to fake metals, so it had to be silver. This ring is just what I wanted at a bargain price."
5,Not Long To Wait!,"This delivery was so fast, and secure. There was no damage to my jewelery. This ring was just what I was looking for. It is a great compliment to my silver ring collection. If you need a thin-sized ring to wear along with any color ring, it's great."
5,Perfect thickness and very light,"It was light in weight, but it was thick enough to look expensive. Love it! If I lose it, I will definitely purchase this again. Recommended!!!"
4,Great price!,"I was a little hesitant to order this because of the low price but I was pleasantly surprised. It came earlier than predicted and just in time for my boyfriends birthday. The ring seems a little light but is stamped with .925 so I think it is sterling silver. It has a nice, shiny surface and the sizing looks accurate - I just have to wait and see if it fits my boyfriend. The cute box that came with it was a plus. Definitely a good deal!"
5,Great ring!,"I have been a long time customer with Gem-ave. This ring is a sturdy ring, I bought it as a thumb-ring. It is comfortable and is a solid piece of sterling silver. The shipping was super fast and the product arrived boxed safe and securely. Gem-ave is the best store for sterling silver and has the best prices."
5,Wonderful,looks great with my wedding ring. Makes it one of a kind! Lots of compliments. Makes my ring one of a kind
3,It's boohbahs!,"It's a weird book, not much writing so easy and fast to read, my kid liked it for a little bit then lost interest."
5,A great book !,"A great book !I really enjoy the book. This is a great book for person who looks for way to improve his/her problem solving approach. It will help your problem solving method more structure. It contains proven 2x2 Matrix ranging from Strategic framework, Organization framework and Individual framework.I strongly recommend for everybody who are preparing for the case interview with big consulting firms. Also, this is the great book for all managers."
2,BAND CUT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE . IT WAS BEST,CUT WITH RICHARDS AND THE BAND(LEVON hELMS) CAUSED ME TO LOOK FOR THE RECORDING. IT IS THE BEST CUT AND NOT INCLUDED FOR LISTENING. OTHER CUTS NOT AS GOOD.
3,Islam Fundamentalism,"(1979C.E., London,England; Sphere Books, 180 pgs; ISBN0722153694) [March 1981, Bantam Books, ISBN0553142879] Chapters: 1-Warnings, 2-A Great Anguish, an Arc of Crisis, 3-'History Surrendered to Our Will', 4-'Distress, Misfortune and Weakness', 5-'No Compassion for Weakness', 6-'Make War on Unbelievers', 7-Purity and Punishment, 8- al-Azhar: Islamic Policy Centre, 9-Islam and Christianity, 10-Islam v the West's Intellectual Havoc, 11-Islam and Economics, 12-Islam Judged by its Minorities, 13-Islam Judged by its Women, 14-A Taste of Literature, 15-Key Countries, 16-Africa, 17-Uneasy Courtship: Soviet and Islam, 18-Out With the Dagger.

5,music to trip to,Trillian Greene is the best music ever. The sounds of the cello and the drums put you in a trance like state. It makes you want to go into the forest and sleep under a log. I highly recomend it!
5,The one to get,"You want Deadbase X over the pricier Deadbase XI. XI adds further and other side projects in place of timing charts, surveys, feedback, and the extensive look at the final 1995 shows. Over 1/3 of X was cut out and replaced with Phil & Friends, Further, Bobby side projects etc. In my opinion X is the definitive Grateful Dead. It is the most complete Grateful Dead setlists, venue info etc. The best and last edition. You can get this cheaper straight from deadbase or dharmarose. As of July 10, 2012 they have brand new hardback Deadbase X for much less than anything I see anywhere else. If you are looking, better scoop one up before they are gone for good."
1,"Lots of slick chat, not much substance.","This book is not really about branding so much as the process of naming new products. While there is some useful basic information about devloping good product names, much of the book is spent essentially advertising the author's services and telling tales of how bad everyone else is at creating product names"
1,Give me a break...,"If you want to learn about what ""branding"" god Delano is, read this book.If you are interested in branding, advertising etc., read just about anything else."
2,Self-made reviews?,It looks like the current customer review rating has been severely inflated by anonymous reviewers quoting the quotes from the cover...
1,I'm returning mine!,"What a disappointment!There is no nutritional information for any of the recipes. Although the recipes have minimal prep time (15-30 minutes), many require over an hour cook time. Also, the recipes have numerous ingredients - lots of cream of soups and fillers - blech! This is NOT a good cookbook for a busy mom who wants to know the nutritional value of meals. I am sending mine back for a refund."
3,giants earrings,these were bought as a stocking stuffer and they were adequate.........a good novelty item. so there . two more words required.
1,Never got them,would like to say good about them but im just glad I got my money back after the whole thing
2,not as represented,earrings were not as pictured I kept them anyway because not time to get new ones before Christmas and they were cheap
4,Giants Earrings,"I was delighted that the earrings came as quickly as they did.........I was impressed with the great quality, perfect size...color was great..."
4,Happy Customer,"I got this for a Christmas gift, Exactly what I expected, the only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is, I like to track my orders, and i was unable to do that with this. It took a little longer than expected to receive it, but it did arrive and i am happy."
3,Good Price but Im Still waiting 4 shipping!!!! after 4 days,I order this item the fastest way possible butafter 4 days Im still waiting my friends.....Dont pay express it false!
5,"Sprays so nicely, very light","The spray nozzle on this is so great, it allows you to spray the product so evenly. Usually you jsut get a big squirt and all the product drips but this is like a perfect mist."
1,Warranty: Purely Fictional,"The clock I purchased from this manufacturer, TimeKeeper, is made with a cheap Chinese movement. Nothing surprising about that. I think every wall clock I've purchased in the past 5 years has the same poor movement and many of them have failed prematurely.Which is what happened with this one, after maybe 6 months. The retailer told me to contact Timekeeper for warranty service. I have emailed and called repeatedly over the past 3 months. On the first call it sounded like the problem was going to be resolved. After a couple of weeks, no replacement. I called and again they said it would be taken care of. After that I cannot get anyone to respond to email or the phone.Their clocks are cheap and if they fail, you can just expect to toss them in the trash and find another. They obviously aren't going to stand behind what they sell (I'd say manufacture but the Chinese do that)."
5,"Works Fantastic, effortless","I bought and intalled this drive on a computer below specifications. I am running it on a Pentium III 550 running Windows XP. Have burned many discs and have never had a problem. I have it in the upright position and just hit the open/close button and never touch the plastic door or fear breaking it per the previous review.Great software, no issues with anything. Everything just runs a bit slower since my computer is below spects."
2,Not that good.,I bought this from best buy. It doesn't burn fast. It only burns top speed with certain types of blank media. And Sony's firmware update changed my drive into a DRX 700UA. So now I can't get the latest firmware updates. Don't buy this drive. Don't make the mistake I did. Just buy some fast internal drive.
1,DOES NOT WORK CHEAP BUILD QUALITY,"I purchased this drive being excited to be on the cutting edge with it's dual layer support. I was very dissappointed with it. The build quality is very cheap, the drive door is light plastic and will easily break off when open if you are not careful. I have tried burning to DVD with about a half dozen different disc brands and none of them are working. I am refering to single layer standard discs as I have not yet tried the dual layer discs. I have tried 1 times burns speeds up to four times burn speeds. I have tried several different software burning products and none of them work, even the Nero Burning Rom that shipped with this drive does not work in DVD Video mode. I can't believe it. I am returning this drive to Amazon for a full refund. STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRIVE. Windows XP recognizes the drive okay but no software can burn to it. This is a real joke and the product should never have been released."
1,Disappointment!,Alfi carafes are great but not this one! Exterior is perfect; inside shows wear (glass lining is spotty looking) but doesn't affect function. The problem is the rubber seal which is loose and allows coffee to pour all over both you and your cup! A mess! I gave it away after one too many spills.
5,Great American Girl Doll,This is a quality product. The glasses are adorable and my girls love to play with her. My 3 year old even drew on her face and we were able to get it off with tooth paste. Her little book will hold up to plenty of play. We have purchased serval more of these little American Girl dolls since receiving this one as a gift. We love the stories that go with the dolls. This dolls inspire imagination and curiosity for history! Great price too!
2,Not that great,We purchased this doll thinking that it came with a book and was a good size doll. When it arrived it was in a box that is about 6.5 inches tall and about 2x2. The book was more like a leaflet and was folded into the box. The doll was very detailed but it was just too small for what we were looking for.
1,Molly Mini for Collectors Only,"Molly Mini is very small and comes in a very plain box. It made for a disappointing Christmas gift for a 6 yr. old, especially for the price. There are many, many dolls to be had for the same price that would much more ""playable"". Now, if you were a doll collector, Molly Mini would make a fine addition to a collection."
2,Not What I Expected,I ordered this doll in the hopes of giving it to my niece for her birthday. It was much smaller than I expected. I returned it because I had a feeling she wouldn't get much use out if it since it was tiny. Unless whoever you're buying this for really likes American Girl I wouldn't recommend this product.
4,Much cuter than pictures,"She is much cuter in person than the pictures in magazines or on the web. My 5 year old daughter, Molly, loves small things and LOVES this doll. The clothing and accessories are of nice quality. I believe the book is the full version of Meet Molly, just miniature size. We can just barely read the words without a magnifying glass. We will go and buy the normal size book of Meet Molly. The only reason I give it 4 stars is the price."
3,doll did not come with glasses as pictured!,This doll did not come with glasses as shown in the picture. We expected that it would since it's a mini doll of Molly who wears glasses! My daughter enjoys the doll and it's nice but did not meet our expectations when we could not find the glasses.
3,don't expect much,"dont expect anything special from this 6"" mini doll and don't expect to be able to read ""the book"" with anything less than a nuetron microscope.nothing more than a small doll"
3,Great resource book for teachers,"This is a great introduction to using kool aid to dye fabric, and using it in a group quilt with kids. Not as many photos as I would have liked, but there's nothing else like it."
2,"It works, kinda","Well, it does what it says it does. But its resolution is low, and half the time the computer thinks it is constantly being plugged in and unplugged. I've also needed to reinstall the drivers every time I restart the computer. And Vista support, well, thats another can of worms. I searched online, and it appears that you can get it to work on Vista, but you have to jump through more hoops then a circus animal."
4,Yay,"Perfect service, however, the product doesn't work with Vista. I should have looked more closely."
2,Common sound problem and customer support,"Seems like a lot of people, including me, are having sound trouble even though we have top-notch computers. The company really isn't doing much and it's practically impossible to get customer support.I play my PS2 on it. Video's ok, sometimes there're green horizontal glitch-streaks but that's not much of a problem. The sound is choppy and that's really annoying.I haven't tried other cards, but I'd recommend those than this one."
5,A Nice Little Device,"This little device has proven to be very helpful to me during the past few months. I use it to hook-up my PS2 right to my PC. That way I don't have to have a TV cluttering up my room. The Gamebridge is a small device that takes up minimum room on your desk and your PC. All you have to do is plug it in and install the drivers and software, then plug-in your device and you're all set! You'll be gaming in no time with the GameBridge."
3,"It works, but support could be better","The program that came with the device to run gamebridge did not work at all, i tried to use the customer service for that program, but they did not support their product because it was sold with the gamebridge. I then tried to use adaptecs customer service, but the serial number was not recognized by adaptec, so i ended up back at square one, quite literally. Spending a couple hours on line researching and downloading drivers, video programs, and many other ways to run the gamebridge, i finally found the program that worked... thanks a lot adaptec... but once i got it to worked, it worked pretty well, not very laggy, and video & was only very slightly distorted."
4,"Nice Little thing, but the price lol",Gamebridge is a great tool. Quality is excellent(depending on what type of computer you use) and it's simple to use. The only thing is that i feel bad for people who are buying it now. [...]
5,Good Product,"PROS: Size, Price, Shipping (Got it in 3 days), Picture QualityCONS: Could be betterThe product does what it says it does. I've tested it using my XBOX 360 on my Dell Inspiron E1705 Notebook (2Ghz CPU, 2GB RAM, 256MB NViDIA, 17""LCD, 1920X1200) and it works great. After ajusting the brightness in the cofig. settings to 150, the picture looked great. This product completly eliminated the lag. Even on XBOX LIVE, it worked great. I can't say much about the sound because I hook up the sound to my Logitech X-540 speakers. I definetly recommend this product to anyone who wants to play their console games on their PC/Laptop.GAMES TRIED: Halo 3, Rainbow 6: Vegas, Gears Of War, Saints Row, Quake 4, Bioshock, Perfect Dark: Zero, F.E.A.R"
4,Very Impressed,Upon reading reviews for devices like this I was skeptic at first but I'm sooo glad i purchased this my xb360 sits right next to my laptop and works perfectly and there is a millisecond of sound delay but besides that it does exactly what it says. Plugs right into my usb and I can switch between pc and console in a flash. If anyone is trying to play games through console or laptop this is the tool that gets it done.
4,Old wine from an old bottle,I periodically go back to this book as I do to all my writing books. And I generally find something of value to think about. A lot of new books on writing are just old content repackaged but I continually find this venerable text refreshing.
2,same ald game,"can't belive this game is the remake of first ridge racer game for the ps1 control are stupid.graphic's are not for a xbox 360 quality over all ridge recer game are a frustrade experience ,with the exention of RAGE RACER game -that was a classic recer game for the ps1. not recomended"
3,Good arcade racer,"There's nothing fancy about this one. Just a solid, arcade style racer that's fun for what you'd expect of an arcade racer."
5,Fun game,"Ridge racer is about drifting. Once you can master the drifting, it's a lot fun. The best part is that it is relatively easy to master drifting. The only thing that I don't like is that I can't race with my friend without going online."
4,WOW I am impressed.,"Not by the graphics though. I thought the graphics would blow me away as they did on the PSP version. But they did not. NEED for Speed and Gotham are better in this department. However, what they did do right in this game is the gameplay. This game is wicked fun to play. Let's not forget it is addicting. You think it only has about 100 races to beat. But once you beat them, you get about another 100 to go. the downside is that many of these races are just the same tracks with different objectives like do it with nitro. This time do it without nitro. But, the racing is fast, the drifting is great, and the jumps are fun. THis game is much better than I thought it would be and much more arcade-like (fun) than expected."
3,"Fun game, but you'll want to strangle the narrator!","The graphics are outstanding in this game. However, after 3 laps you'll get REALLY sick of the repetitive comments of the (wanna-be Chris Rock) narrator!Rent this one first. Compare for yourself w/ NFS Most Wanted, PGR3, Burnout Revenge and Test Drive Unlimited (soon to be released, free demo available now)."
2,Boring and Repetitive,"BORING! You do the same thing everytime; gas, drift; gas, drift. you will also be so tired of ""Nitrous ready"" from the stupid announcer. If you want the achivements, you will have to win more than 200+ races to complete the game at three minutes each race. With doing the same thing every race, it just gets flat out boring. Graphics are good, but thats about it. PGR3 is a much better bet."
2,Share not,"was not happy with this product, may be it was me but it just did not work well. Not a happy camper."
1,Of the making of books there is no end.,Thrown together. Page after page of sprawl. The publisher must have a low opinion of the customer to offer this.
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I recently puchased this highchair for my second child (after spending entirely too much $$ on the Peg I bought for the first). Because I'm still using the first one, however, I was looking for a relatively inexpensive second highchair for my son that still met my basic needs (easy release tray, lockable wheels, safety harness/seatbelt, and reclining seat). I sort of purchased this one blindly in the store, and I have been so pleasantly surpised by it that I felt compelled to write this review. Great highchair, in my opinion, especially for the money. Not too difficult to assemble and pretty cute, neutral design, too."
5,Awesome Chair! I love it!,"This is a great highchair! My daughter absolutely loves it! The reclining postions are so nice, she even has taken a nap in it!! It is easy to clean and easy to move around. I'm looking forward to using it as a booster seat also as she gets older. I would definately recomend this highchair!"
2,kinda bulky and looks better in picture,I registered for this highchair and recieved it as a baby shower gift. It took me awhile to put it together and once it was together i wasnt at impressed by its ability to fold up becaue even folded its extremely bulky. The cushion is made of thick plastic that seems like it would be very uncomfortable to lean on and it doesnt quite fit right. I wouldnt recommend this highchair if you have limited kitchen space. We are returning it to get the fisher price space saver.
4,pretty good chair,"I just bought and put together this chair, although I won't be using it for a couple months. I liked the neutral colors of the chair. The height and recline adjustments seem simple enough and it appears sturdy. Putting it together was also simple enough. One of the reasons I chose it was the ability to store the tray on the back and having it fold up when not in use. The tray doesn't store on the back very well, it hangs rather awkwardly. When the chair is folded it will not stay upright. It has to carefully lean against something or lay flat. So, unless you have just the right spot to store it, it's not very helpful to fold it. Purchasing it for the fold feature is not worth it. Otherwise, I expect it to be a good chair for our baby, when he/she gets here."
5,Why oh Why?,"Looks at common childhood feelings and emotions using a Q and A format . Some topics covered are ""Why do I get upset with other people?"" and ""Why do I feel left out now that we have a new baby?"" Each topic is broken down into several related questions. Colorful, but slightly cluttered, book design. Karen Woodworth-Roman Children's Science Book Review"
1,This is medical advice?,"Any benefit from amputation of healthy tissue must be measured against the loss it necessarily entails. Schoen does not discuss the erotogenic quality of the foreskin, its immunological purpose, or the bodily dysmorphism its loss inflicts on some men. This books chirpy tone also alerts the reader to a salesman-like approach to the subject. Circumcision is serious surgery and the foreskin is not just skin. Infant boys shouldn't be treated so dismissively. There are much better and more informative books on this subject out there. Readers would be better off skipping Schoen and going with almost any other book on the subject."
1,"Fiction, not fact -- a biased review by an anti-foreskin zealot","This book is more fiction than fact, the work of a biased anti-foreskin fundamentalist.What happened to all the critical reviews of this book? They have been deleted and replaced by the reviews of two other anti-foreskin advocates. Why?"
1,Where'd all the reviews go?,"Way to go, Amazon, for deleting most of the reveiws on this book. Is that how Amazon operates? This book reflects such an antiquated view on this subject, it was sickening, and I posted a review reflecting this opinion back some time ago. But it appears at Amazon, censorship reigns. Ah, well - Doesn't change the fact that this is a terribly biased and irrelevant book. Just sours my opinion of Amazon, that's all."
1,Pay me for reading this!,"I wish I had spent my money elsewhere. There are several other books available that actually have current unbiased information. If Schoen thinks publicizing his poetry on the topic will aid him, he is sorely mistaken. If anything it leaves the reader almost feeling dirty and violated.Schoen simply appears to be stuck in his generations time capsule. He refuses to accept even the possibility that the information he learned, has taught and has pushed as fact, could indeed, be wrong.Medical personnel must look at medicine with an open mind. Schoen has failed miserably at this attempt.Do your bank account a favor and save your money with this one.Beth"
5,Peter Jeffery writes? BUY!,"A warm, loving, sometimes humorous man who shares his wealth so freely.If it has his name on it, don't think twice, just get it!"
4,Johnny and his cousins get into all kinds of mischief in FL,"I often laughed out loud at the misadventures of Johnny and his cousins in Boggy, FL. They scavenge at the local dump, steal watermelons and mangoes, have skunks for pets, run from the wrath of grandma Gert and find five hundred pounds of marbles in an abandoned house! Rainey made me wish I'd grown up in a family like Johnny's."
5,Excellent reading. Keeps you reading from begining to end,"I found this author to be quite witty. He writes as though it's all happening as he writes. I found myself feeling that I was there or at least knowing the people he wrote of. Though I never grew up in a rural area, he made you live it through his writing. It was extremely warm and funny and it kept my attention from the beginning to the end."
3,didnt realize i was buying a used book,"no where in the product info did it suggest that this book was used however it clearly was... their was dirt on the cover and page 97-98 is actually torn from the book, and one page was really bent as well... so not impressed by the fact a actually page was ripped out."
4,The Early years,"Before purchasing this book, keep in mind that the photos of the models were all taken in the (19)50's, 60's, and 70's. That said, the photography is good, but not exceptional. The book is small but well put together and enjoyable."
1,not much,"The pictures in this book are too small. Another problem is there are very few pictures that could be described as modern. The pictures are quite dated and the older hairstyles and makeup turn this book into a vintage photo collection, even though that's not what it's really billed as. Very disappointing, overall."
5,Redhead Aficionada,"As a straight woman, this isn't a book I would normally buy. However, as a redhead and a collector of books about redheads, I had to have it. Such a wierdly fun addition to my collection! Most of the photographs have a retro pin-up girl quality. A great gift for redheads and redhead lovers alike."
5,redheaded beauties,This compilation of Playboy models will not disappoint the admire of redheads. With Playboy you know that the women are all going to be gorgeous. The ladies are lovely and artfully bare their boobs and buns. Beautiful.
5,Gunsight Crossing,I have in my library most of William and J.A. Johnstone books and I have enjoyed reading all of them.
4,don't miss it; very good,"bought a size 7 from zappos.com, very good style and bright color-black; heel is 1 and a half inch high, feel solid, soft leather; the only flaw--it is a loafer, no lace, so the shoe is not as tight as the laced ones. don't run on them when u try to catch a bus."
3,Over-rated,"This book wasn't bad, and I liked it, but it certainly wasn't worthy of 5 stars. The book had many deficiencies. For example:The ""Pax Romana"" section didn't really address to what extent Caesar was responsible for the Pax Romana period.For a book focused on Caesar's Gallic Wars, too little effort was spent describing the actual strategies of Caesar, and too much on assessing Caesar's own bias in his own writings. As far as I could tell, this book wasn't supposed to be a critique of Caesar's writing, it was supposed to be a history lesson. One note in the introduction about the inadequacy of Caesar himself as an unbiased source would have sufficed."
4,A response to a reader with delusions of intelligence...,"I am responding to the HAARP, Alaska ""reader"". Either the reader has repressed delusions of being a comedian or Stanfords standards for English and Grammar have significantly dropped. The latter may explain why he ""couldn't get passed page 44"". The only ""brightside"" to his review was the fact that his seven year old son watches the X-Files, this proves that stupidity is not an inherent trait. I do feel for the state of Alaska, somewhere there is a village missing their idiot. I found the book both interesting and informative. I would recommend it to any avid fan of the X-Files or anyone with an inquisitive mind interested in biology and genetics."
1,childish would be insulting to my kid...!,"My 7 year old who enjoys the tv show ocassionally and most sci-fi brought thebook home and I tried, really tried to get to page 50 before saying it was ridiculous but 44 was as far as I got...I am a math teacher and science/biology major (Stanford) and love a good sci-fi and find the (true) investigation of UFOs exciting and interesting but the book was nothing buta chance to make a buck off chumps who think the gobermint is out to get us types or the really gullible people who couldn't determine truth and science from bunk even as it dropped a bomb on them (triangle ufo-aurora). Its dorks like Ms. C that ruin it for the real investigators.....Doc. Marten."
5,Iguanas and slam dancing and cancer - - Oh My!,"I had this be in my ""to be read pile"" for months. I would pick it up, peak at it and instead pick something I thought was more ***important*** to read. Let's face it work, friends and other distractions get in the way of reading - - hence I am forever behind. Big mistake on my part. For one thing, the chapters in the book are strong enough to be read on their own. Secondly. this book is immensely enjoyable and intelligent. I had some reservations that the book may be dry and dense - - but I stand corrected. Reading this book is like listening in to wonderful conversation. Jeanne Cavelos is witty, imaginative and brings the science down to earth. Not only would I recommend this to fans of the X-Files, but to anyone who grooves on science or has a sense of humor. Read the book and discover the relationship between owls, people and grapefruit!"
1,noise is big,I bought this earphone for my wife. She is using Samsung T319. The first earphone we recevied doesn't work so we have to ask them for replacement. The second one we got is fine but there is always annoying cuicuit noise when it is used. I am satisfied with their service but very disappointed with this earphone.
2,Hands free headset,"Well it's fine as long as you hold the connection tight to your phone, but as soon as I let go it seems to lose connection and I don't even realize that the person on the other end is still talking. So.... that's not good. It's really comfortable though... in case that counts."
4,When you break one...,"...you must re-purchase the entire set. Lund Int. (the manufacturer)does NOT make available replacements on an individual basis. I broke one of the rear window visors, I cannot even purchase the pair for the rear door windows. Now I've got a choice: pull 'em all off OR: another $55 for another set of 4. Sigh....Other than that, I like the visors. Easy install, looks good on my rig.Edit- I contacted Lundt International, and they stepped up to the plate. The (very understanding) customer service rep sent me a replacement set, no charge. That is 5-star service. I still would like to be able to purchase these individually, because it was my fault the visor broke. However, I'll keep the other 3 in the set, and if I break another I'll have a backup."
2,If you have a 2010 Ram Crew Cab and this product came up do not purchase,If you have a 2010 Ram Crew Cab and this product came up do not purchase as it is for the MUCH smaller quad cab windows. For some reason Amazon's (make sure it fits) app did not work on this one.Luckily amazon was good about it and paid for return shipping I had to order mine from truckaddons.com and spoke to a salesman who got me the right part the first try.
3,shades,"The shades I just purchased are OK BUT, they allow a lot of roarer when you are moving with the window is open an 1"" or better.I have had them on my previous Exployer and on my GMC pick up and I had or have no roarer problem like this."
1,Will Not fit,I ordered these shades and used the configuration tool on Amazon.com and the shades would not fit. The truck that needs them is a 2006 Dodge Ram Mega Cab and the rear shdeds are about 6 inches too short.
5,has great great great songs,"this is an awesome cd, it has amazing songs from a bunch of great bands, i got it at some store and i listen to it all the time, its downright punk"
2,"I'm sure it works, but good luck getting it into your shaver by yourself","Rather than buying a new shaver, I figured I'd fix my old one (one of the gray rotating heads had lost the top knob) using this motor.I imagine the motor works just fine. But, after the challenge of removing seven star-headed screws, I found that the motor wires were soldered to the circuit board that runs the shaver. I did not have the equipment nor the skill to remove the old motor and re-solder the new.My point is, if you're buying this to fix your shaver, you might want to have a professional do it, or be a more skilled electrician than I am. It's not a matter of simply popping out the old motor and hooking up the new.Yeah, in the end I ended up buying a new shaver. : ("
3,"Okay, but not really worth the cost","It does what it says it does, and it does it well, but the price is just too high. I am not saying that what it does is not worth the price, but that compared to what other similarly designed diffusers cost, this is high.The instructions are minimal, and you are asked to make ""work around"" fixes for this to fit certain models of flashes. When someone charges this much for a piece of plastic, it should be custom fit to whatever model of flash they are marketing it for, and not ask the customers to ""squeeze it this and that way"" to get it to fit."
1,"I like Kristen Bell, but...","This is definitely not her best work. Bell is in it for maybe a half hour, then the psycho kills her and stores her in the bathtub, burying her piece by piece. It's not only morbid and gross - the plot is awful and goes no where. Its incredibly boring - not Kristen Bell's best work at all, although she really is only in it for a few minutes."
1,Save your money,"I bought the multi-title DVD this movie was on purely because Kristen Bell was in the cast and I am a fan of the little lady. Alas, Kristen was either a total unknown when this was made and hoped it would help her career, or she did someone a huge favor by appearing in it. To put it politely, this movie sucks eggs, big time. Terrible script, terrible acting, terrible camera work, a god-awful and ear-damaging sound track, and clearly made on a shoe-string budget, probably using a low-rez Flip videocam. The creator(s)of this film are clearly better suited for their day jobs bussing tables, and I suggest they stay there and leave the movie making to people who have an iota of talent, which they clearly do not."
4,An Odd Little Film,"Roman stars Lucky McKee (who normally directs) as a shy social outcast who accidentally kills a girl (played by Kristen Bell) that he has a crush on. He keeps her body on ice in his bathtub. His depressed life changes when a strange woman becomes interested in him. This is an odd little movie. When it first starts you can easily tell that it is an low-budget film with bad camera work and lighting. I almost pushed the stop button, but I gave it a chance and I'm glad that I did. It is a strange movie, more of a thriller than a horror film. I actually felt sorry for Roman!"
2,"Mostly Horrible, Mainly Annlying","Okay, the inane boring soundtrack is the least of this feeble minded movie's problems. Acting is rigid and dialogue is purely crap, rarely ringing true. No gore, no suspense, nothing remotely worth the time and money invested. After the girl dies, so did this flick. Total waste!"
5,maple pub table,"LOVE it! solid pieces, easy to assemble and a great price in comparison to others I've seen which weren't as thick or sturdy."
2,Fair condition,"I purchased this book to replace a library book my daughter dropped in a puddle after school. It was listed as in nearly new condition. The description did not mention that there was writing in the book. Therefore, I was not allowed to turn it in. It was a total waste of time and money for me."
4,cool book!!,"Alice and Rex,11 year old kids, have been put in the hospital because of thier hunger strike. Alice is ""starving"" herself because she doesn't want to live with her cold mother, nor her abusive stepfather, the only person Alice does want to live with is her real father, but she knows that won't happen. Alice has promised if/when Rex dies she will start eating."
3,Not Brooks' Best,"The author doesn't waste any time on initial character development in this book about a girl wasting away in a hospital bed as a result of a hunger strike. Brooks' technique of starting this story in the middle of things presents a challenge. I found myself wanting more background information about both Alice and her counterpart, Rex, who is dying of a terminal illness. In bits and pieces Brooks reveals more about each of these characters, but the young audience for whom the book is intended may have long since lost interest due to confusion. While the story line will intrigue those middle-school-aged readers who are patient, the sarcasm and vocabulary used by the two eleven-year-old protagonists is too advanced for their ages to be believable."
3,The book called the Vanishing is a very interesting.,I think the book Vanishing is a excellent book and very interesting. Its keep you reading the book because it is not boring. The way it is interesting is when Alice stops eating when she is twelve years of age. She also met her friend named Rex who had cancer. Thats why I think it is an excellent book to read!
2,Not great...,"This book was okay, but it was a bit confusing. The plot was good but I think it could have been written better. It was a little weird, and it just wasn't a great book, in my opinion. I wouldn't highly recommend it, but go ahead and read it if you want to."
2,This GREAT show and its fans deserve BETTER!,"BEWARE this product. While it contains the season's episodes, it is void of episode commentary, is VERY slim on special features, and, for all intents and purposes, is HARDLY an official release.Note that Amazon even denotes: ""DVD-R Note: This product is manufactured on demand when ordered from Amazon.com."" Translation: This DVD is burned on the spot by Amazon (not MTV) for you when you order it (Notice that it's not available in any other stores besides Amazon).As far as I can tell, this was a rather haphazard and half-hearted release by MTV and Amazon at the onset of the third season airing on TV to get some quick cash. But if you want a REAL release from MTV, don't buy into this cheapy run and give them what they want!9 bare episodes and a few minutes of deleted scenes, all not even manufactured by MTV, aren't really worth the price, in my opinion. This fantastic show and it's fans deserve MUCH better, MTV!"
3,Getting Less,"I have all the Rob and Big's and the first season of Fantasy Factory. I just recently bought this second season and hold on a minute!? No commentary! I looked all through the menu's and nothing! That is my favorite part of the dvd's, and it makes no sense. Also, it appears as though a lot of the music is changed from tv (Drama Beats?) this must be a liscensing and royalty thing, but a lot of the famous artist songs are missing here, and it changes the impact of some of the episodes. So if you want to complete your collection, you are getting less with this dvd than the last three. Can only hope season three has the commentary or I might let that season go until they fix this."
2,"OK DVD, but will get dust in your shelf.","Udo's voice is shot. Only a die-hard fan would not acknowledge this. Anyway, considering his age and his singing style, it's still good.The songs, of course, are good. But editing could be much, much better. It seems the venue was so small that the producers did not know where to put the cameras adequately.Sound is good, and both guitar players are right on the spot. Stefan Kauffman tends to play his few leads close to how they are done in the albums, whereas Ior Gaudi prefers to change them a little bit.I think the cover art is simply stupid. I understand it follows the concept of their most recent album, but it's ugly and cheap anyway."
4,PLEASE RE-RELEASE THIS ON CD!,"This is one of my favorites! Unfortunately, I only have it on a cassette I taped from someone's lp back in the '70's. The songs always crack me up because they're so conceited. For example ""Girl, I got something good for you guess what it is 'what?"" ME!""or""You Need This to Satisfy That"". There's not one filler song. Even the instrumental is good. I've wanted to find this on a CD for ages. Yes, ""Jack & Jill"" is on it, but there are other good songs like ""Let's Go All The Way"" and ""Is This A Love Thing"". The label is making a big mistake keeping this under wraps..."
4,Good price - great function,This is a great knife! It's sharp and light and works well as a prep knife. It's also dishwasher safe!
4,Great little paring knife,"Pros:-- Ridiculously cheap-- Lightweight-- Thin, flexible blade-- Sharp, sharp sharp!Cons:-- No heft at all-- Small handle is not particularly ergonomicI compare this Victorinox to an old Henckels with molded handle that it is essentially replacing. The Henckels handle may be disproportionally long, but it fits my large hand perfectly, and I find the sense of heft gives me better control, as well. In spite of the weight, I feel like I can use the Henckels all day long; the Victorinox with its combination of extreme lightness and sharpness is in some ways harder for me to control and thus over time can be more fatiguing, a bit like carrying a gun with a hair trigger. If you like using tools that have a substantial feel, the Victorinox, which feels semi-disposable, might not be for you. The price and sharpness, however, are compelling, and this, along with other knives in this line, is one of the great bargains in the culinary world."
4,Good value,"Its very sharp, seems to hold an edge well and sharpens well. An excellent price - cost more to ship than purchase."
4,Reading Assessment,These assessments provide a teacher with a quick way of monitoring progress and determining need for additional testing. Easy to administer and to score.
1,Defective Manufacturing,I have Pulmonary Fibrosis and read a review that stated this dvd helped improve breathing efficiency. I have ordered about 10 of these dvd's now from different places.... none of them work correctly. They work for about 2 minutes and then skip and drag.... obviously a manufacturing defect. I was hoping to get one that worked so that I would be able to improve my breathing. Luckily I have been able to return and get refunded for each of the dvd's I purchased. My advice.... dont get your hopes up like I did! I have been dissapointed several times over this dvd!
4,ALWAYS A FAVORITE,"Calyx has been the choice of many since first introduced by Prescriptives in 1986. It's a fresh invigorating fragrance with top notes of grapefruit, passion fruit, mango, papaya and guava. Blend these with touches of freesia, lily and marigold for a scent that envelopes the wearer warmly while radiating the energetic bouquet of a garden in bloom.It's a renewing scent for warm weather and comforting in the winter months as a reminder of the spring to come. Calyx knows no boundaries as it is appropriate for a girl's first perfume and enjoyed by women of all ages.Calyx is also available in bath and shower gel and a body lotion rich in coconut oil and Vitamin E."
3,bad image and description,"The image shows a food-saver mini, it is white and shorter than the V475 and comes with a canister. The v475 doesn't come with a canister is longer and is black and chrome."
4,Great for Home Use,I have the V475 FoodSaver and it works great for leftovers or for items you need to re-package. It is very effective for home use.
3,There are better out there,"These are very average interconnects. Granted for the price I was not expecting a lot, but I don't think these are much better than the stock connects that come with most equipment. If you want really well made interconnects and don't want to spend to much money check out Dayton's line thru Parts Express. They are much better than these."
5,Great CD...Highly recommended...,I saw her at the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville a couple weeks ago and bought the CD immediately. I played it at least 4 times the following day driving around Nashville. It is still in the top 2 with Anita Cochran (who actually recommended it during the show).
5,CAN'T STOP HUMMING!,"I'm just discovering the Blues, so I'm no expert. I heard several of the songs from this album performed on World Cafe and had to buy it. I love it - especially the first six tracks."
3,It's okay,"I think it gives minor relief, but not the major pain relief I was looking for. I think it works better for some people."
3,Kool and Fit,This product works well. It controls the pain somewhat until I can get to a chiropractor. It smells quite strong but the smell goes away in about 20 minutes.
2,Came broken,Broken and hassle to return so had to go out of my way and buy one when I order online for a reason
5,Perfect!!,"This spice rack is the perfect size to sit on the counter in a small kitchen, and blends well with the granite counters and black appliances"
4,Spice Rack For Home.,As Spice racks go this is a very fair price for the quality. My 4 not 5 stars was based on not recieving some spices I use allot. The jars are a good size and have a dual purpose top. It is a nice looking rack and doesn't take up to much space. You can't go wrong with this.
3,good for price,"seems a bit unstable/ plastic-y but it seems to be solid, no issues yet. the spices that come with the rack are worthless and taste bad. plan on getting your own."
5,perfect love it~~,"just what i expected... love it, is perfect size and come with the spice ... will buy again if I have to"
5,Wonderful!,I love my new spice rack. The variety and the sizes of the jars are very generous. It has a easy spin! I would recommend it for your kitchen.
1,Disappointingly low quality spice rack,I made the mistake of purchasing this spice rack as a gift for my mom. The handle broke off of the rack as she was removing it from the packaging. The entire rack is plastic. The base was not sturdy. I wish I had known how poorly made the thing would be before I bought it so I could have skipped it altogether for a better quality product. Very disappointing!
5,Great rack for the money,"I bought 2 of these and completely changed out the spices in one of them. The first one I bought was broken at the base and I had to take it back, but I made sure the next one was OK. It would be great if the bases were wood and not plastic, but as long as I take care of it I shouldn't have any problems. If I had more room and more friends to dump spices on I would love to get a 3rd one and change out the spices as well."
3,Civil War Naval Review Part 1,"This fills in some of the gaps in my library on the American Civil War Navies, in particular, the Union Navy . This book does help with the background information that I was looking for. I would have like to see more technical drawings, with dimensions, for building models of these ships. Otherwise, a good book to read and work with."
5,"Images beautiful, glossary excellent","I picked this up in order to educate myself on the hand gestures that are so important in interpreation of specific sculptures or paintings.The images are clear, and if read carefully, one can learn the general meaning of several ""mudra"" or hand gestures. The examples chosen are excellent and for a volume so small and thick, are remarkably impressive. The proper names are given, and it covers most of the Buddhist world."
5,As good as it gets.,"I have almost all of Riley Lee's work and I love his style. Due to his Eastern musical roots and it never occured that he would do an album with a Western feel to it. Lee does show some of his Eastern flair on a few of the tracks, but Marshall Mcguire's harp sets a classical/celtic tone that is perfectly matched by Lee's lyrical adaptation. This really is an amazing album + I have no clue who Marshall Mcguire is, but his playing is sublime; as far as I have heard I don't think Grand Master Riley Lee has ever been accompanied by a more apt musician."
3,"Powerful enough, problems with bag and mulching","We've been using a B&D electric (non-cordless) for three years. Now we have a more complicated yard shape, and wanted to try cordless. Our lot is about 1/3 acre, and with this unit we have plenty of power to get the job done in one try. We like to use a bag for a clean looking lawn. However, the bag won't fill. Instead, the bag gets clogged and all the grass comes out from the sides of the unit and make ""stripes"" of dead grass on either side of the row. This happens both with damp and dry grass. I can't believe I haven't seen other reviews mention this! We removed the bag and put in the mulching chute, but honestly, we're still getting those stripes. Bought it at Lowe's for $370, and cannot justify the cost for a messy looking lawn. Will have to try another brand!"
5,great lawnmower,"I bought this mower to replace basically the same one that I had been using for several years. On the old one, the blades had become dull and the battery wasn't holding the charge, but it was quite old. I love not having to mess with and breathe gasoline and not polluting the environment. It is easy to charge and use. Prompt service and no assembly is nice, too. It's worth every penny."
3,Do not recommend if you have a decent sized yard,"I bought this thinking it was a good idea because you would not need gas or anything else, just electricity. My lot is between 1/4 to 1/3 of an acre. I cannot mow the entire yard on one charge; not even close. Other than that enormous hassle it is a good mower. It is easy to adjust and seems to mow well (as long as you have electricity)."
2,Broke after 2-years Very Disappointed,"I was excited to ""upgrade"" to an electric lawnmower. And if I had rated it at first blush - I would have given it 3.5 stars.However, in two years of using this lawn mower I have found it to be sub-par. Its width makes it a chore to mow even a small lawn. Its design makes it vulnerable to constant clumping and shutdown - whenever the grass is moist. And the last straw - a broken ""on switch"" - occurred this week.Overall, a fairly shoddy machine for the price.I am not impressed with this and other Black and Decker tools - including the cordless weed-whacker (grass hog). The battery life is quite short - about 30-40 minutes (tops) for the lawn mower and 10 minutes for the weed-whacker.Don't be an early adopter. It's not worth it. Wait a few years until they sort this technology out. I wish I had. Now I'm out $500 and considering a cheaper - but more durable - gas mower."
3,Great until it Breaks!,"This starts the third season and overall I have loved this mower. However yesterday the handle that turns the power on and off simply fell out of the holder! After a lengthy struggle to take apart the housing the problem was obvious--a part that seemed to be designed to fail! There is a pin that is difficult to access and it sheered off--black plastic with a grey interior designed to look like metal (which it was not). Since it was clearly a part that could NOT be replaced, I had to drill out the core remaining in the receptacle and screw a metal screw in. Now I get to hope it does not fail and send me shocked to my just reward. This is a penny part designed to fail and guaranteeing you will need to buy a new mower or a very expensive control system after a few years of use."
2,The industrial designers should be smacked in the head for this one.,The industrial designers should be smacked in the head for this one.Such potential -such a screw up from a design standpoint.1) Cheap self destructing safety handle.2) Charger connection - just poor.3) Key slides in both ways - but only works one way.4) Brushes seem to be a problem - but you can get it to power up if you flick the brushes with a screw driver (insulated screw-driver - be careful)I like the potential - but Black & Decker should get back to the drawing board. Any CMM1200 buyers deserve an apology and a free trade up.
2,Disappointed,"This item, Black & Decker CMM1200 19-inch-volt cordless mower, was purchased on line and received in May 2009, used to mow a 60' by 80' area weekly until October 2009. Battery did not hold charge during the entire mowing time, or distance.Proceeded to charge battery for Summer 2010 and battery did not hold charge to allow the lawn to be mowed, battery required replacing.It is presumed that life of a battery would be longer than one year before requiring replacement."
5,Good mower,"I've had this mower for 2 months now. Works great.No assembly required when opening it. Easy to charge and start.Cut pretty good, though does at times have trouble cutting on lower setting in areas where there is not too much grass. But when it is fully charged, it does a good job of cutting, even thick high grass that I hadn't cut in 1 month was no problem.Would recommend this highly. Plus, after i'm done, I clean off the mower and recharge it for its next use. No worries about gas, oil, or any other maintainence."
5,Great Mower!,"I could not wait for my old gas mower to die, and it finally did! I replaced my 5.0 hp walk behind push mower with this. It is great no more pulling the cord, messing with gas, oil frustrations, fumes carbon monoxide giving my money to the Saudis! I have about 1/3 of an acer to mow and this does the job with no problem, to me it feels lighter and easier to push that my old gas mower and is diffidently cleaner!I ordered my mower from Amazon with the free super saver shipping (5-9 days) but it was at my front door in 4. I would recommend this mower to everyone with under a 1/3 of an acer."
3,Small lawn best for this mower,"I have used this product for three mowings now and have concluded that it is very good for small yards. It does not have the battery life to last long enough for a medium or large yard. It also cannot handle tall grass very well. We had to delay mowing due to recent rains and it took two and sometimes three passes with the mower to get the grass cut properly. This means, of course, that we spent several days getting caught up as the battery cannot handle that much mowing in one day and it takes about 9 hours to recharge once you drain it down completely."
3,Black & Decker Electric Mulching mower,After using this mower for a couple of weeks we are disappointed with its results. The grass has to be on the short side before the mulching mower leaves a desirable cut. Without the mulcher you have to use the bag which is on the small side. My husband may return it soon. He just isn't satisfied.
1,Piece of junk,I got this mower from amazon.com and was excited to start mowing my lawn. I charged it overnight like it said to and I got about 10-15 minutes of mowing done and even then it was struggling to cut grass about 3/4 an inch high. I charged it again overnight and the next day I got about 4 minutes of mowing done before it died again. Totally worthless unless your lawn is about 20 feet by 5 feet big.
1,Watch Out!,"I really thought this Black & Decker 19"" 24-Volt Cordless Mulching Rear Bag Mower# CMM1200 was the answer to getting rid of my old gasoline mower with all its noise, oil, gasoline, filter, pollution and maintenance. But then, after a year of use and meeting all my expectations, a simple thin plastic rod about three quarters of an inch in length, broke in the switch lever and a new reality set in! After taking the mower to an authorized service factory, I was told, after a two week wait, that the part needed to repair the mower was on `back order' and would not arrive until September 8th. So, in the middle of summer where mowing is required at least once a week, I'm waiting nearly two months for a part! This means I'll have to buy a gas powered mower again so that I will not be fined by my home owners association.It seems that the Black & Decker 19"" 24-Volt Cordless Mulching Rear Bag Mower# CMM1200 is not ready for serious service and support."
4,B&D CMM1200 Cordless Mower,Works well but a bit heavy to push due to the battery. But you get used to it. The plastic shroud was severely damaged in transit but Amazon quickly and painlessly refunded the replacement cost. Much better than messing around with gas and oil. Glad I bought this.
4,SO easy to start!,"I was always afraid of mowing the lawn because I had trouble starting my gas mower. Starting this mower is effortless, and it's nice to know that I'll never have to buy gas for it. My lawn is a very modest size, so it works well for me; I was able to mow the whole lawn on one charge."
5,Great mower,"I think this is a great mower. I love not having to fill it with gas. Also, it is not as loud as our other mower and I can hear my music through my headphones while mowing. The kids like it and have fun mowing with it."
5,Making Mowing Greener,"So far so good. I ordered this mower when my gas unit threw a rod. The mower came within three days and, after charging overnight, was ready to go ""out of the box."" One of the good features is that you can keep the mower plugged into the charger without harming the battery (although I don't...force of habit) Add this to the fact that it starts every time when the switch is thrown, it stops as soon as the switch is off (blade stops with inductive breaking), and the only noise is the fan-like whirr of the blade, this mower is great. It will mow St. Augustine grass (that tough Florida grass) for about an hour to an hour and a half per charge...a good excuse for not being out in the heat and humidity very long."
3,heavy-- handle pin breaks,"Mine worked OK for awhile, then the plastic pin that holds in the activating switch broke.It shows the poor ethics in the design lab at B&D.; They haven't the work ethic of doing it right the first time to reduce the rate of warranty returns. I replaced it with a steel 3/16"" x 1.5"" tension pin costing 61 cents. I was actually lucky that the warranty had expired.How ridiculous to have a ""safety key"" of the same color as the working key--it just makes the use of the mower more confusing. I tossed out the ""safety key""I've seen the issues others have had with batteries and chargers. If mine dies, I'll just buy a corded mower."
2,Just returned ours..wouldn't hold a charge and it's only 10 months.,"We bought our BD last Sept 2008. At first it was fantastic! Can't say the same about it this yr. In less than 1yr, the ""beast"" barely had any power when it was charged for a full week! Thank goodness for the 2yr warranty. We returned it today and got a Lawnboy with an electrc start. Huge difference!"
2,Typical 3rd World (Chinese ?) junk,"It sounded like the answer to my small lawn needs. The item was shipped in good time and was well packed. During the minor assembly required, I discovered one of the handle bar plastic securing nuts was broken and the handle bar assembly could not be tightened. I looked for a parts list to order a replacement since the mower still looked like a good deal. No parts list. I searched further. No warranty, no instructions, no nothing !!. Not even a shipping list. When I contacted Amazon for the broken part, I was told that they didn't keep parts and I had to return the entire 80 pound boxed mower for credit, which I did at some inconvenience. In fairness, Amazon acted reponsibly and credited me promptly but Amazon should be more careful of their purchasing from 3rd World Junk Dealers like Black and Decker. Never again !"
1,Dead on Arrival,We had a Toro cordless for about 8 years before it died. I purchased the Black and Decker about a month ago. It arrived DOA. Fortunately I live only about 30 minutes from a service center. They said it was a switch problem. Got the mower back in a week and used it until yesterday when it died again. Same problem. Should have it back in another week. How many times can it fail before I call it a lemon.
1,Used 3 times,"I was impressed the first 3 times I used this mower. It was very quiet and cut the grass easily. On my fourth attempt the mower would not spool up to speed. I emailed customer service, they shipped out a charger (took about one week).... Still the same problem. Now I get to drive 30 miles (one way)to the factory service center to see if they can fix the problem. Stay away from this mower."
4,"Liked it, Wish I had the removable battery","I've had this mower about four years and have used it lightly - very small yard, maybe 10 uses a year. I've always liked it - quiet, plenty powerful, can store it in a waist-high shed when folded. I must give kudos to Black & Decker. Long after the warranty expired my charger cord failed. It came apart with copper wires exposed at one end. I felt it was a defect and should be replaced free of charge. They agreed and provided a new and improved charger. I'm glad to see the mower is working perfectly again - I was concerned the battery had worn out. Wish the removable battery design had been available when I bought this. People who purchase these are eco-minded and don't want to send this whole machine to the landfill when the battery dies. I will consider purchasing the newer design when this wears out."
5,Much better than expected,"Having lived on almost an acre for the last five years we needed a smaller lawn mower when we moved. Bought this one from Amazon. Love it.1) Quiet.2) No fumes.3) No gas to mess with.4) Good operational safetyI've never gotten along with small gas powered motors. I've used electrics before, but of the corded variety. This is much better. Battery seems to last over an hour without problems. Easy to change heights. Release the handle and the blade stops right away. Flip the switch and its back in use. No cord to mess with or run over. No gas to store, no special tools."
4,"So far, so good","Really mulches well. Easy to start. Wonder about the availabity of the battery. Not too many service centers available. Have used it 3 times. Im used to a self propelled mower and am 77 years old. Oh well, I need the exercise. No complaints as yet."
4,Everything I wanted,"This mower arrived quickly and after just a few minutes to assemble, it was running. Came fully charged and ready to go. I have over 8,000 square feet of lawn and it easily handles it on just a single charge. Because it is cordless, the battery makes this mower heavier than other mowers, especially a corded one. So on the slight hills, it takes a little muscle to push, but is much faster than my old corded mower as I don't have to use any lengths of cord, which were in the way. It's nice to have a rear mounted grass catcher that works. Also, this model gives you the choice to catch or mulch, which is good in the hotter parts of the year. In short, this is a great mower, even consumers gave this model a big thumbs up. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star is the weight. But, isn't that why you want a push mower to begin with? A mower that is kind to the outdoors plus you get a little exercise too!"
2,Need tolook twice more often,"I bought this baby from Amazon last september 09 and have had nearly one year of use with limited use (long winter and burnt grass this summer). 1)The cut is not clean at all and need to pass over sometimes twice 2) the charger died on me today 3) heavy and replacement battery looks like a future shocker... All in all, not ""excited"" about this mower..."
3,CMM1200 Black&Decker Cordless Lawnmower,"I bought this mower in Sept. 0f 2008. In general I like the mower but it does have some issues. I agree with most of the reviewers that this is somewhat heavier than similar gas mowers. It doesn't cut medium length grass very evenly (it leaves a bit of a ridge on one side) and it has a tough time in taller grass. My primary problem is that today, the plastic post in the handle of the on switch broke, rendering the mower useless. This confirms what many reviewers have said about the switch being the weak link of this mower. I guess I'll have to borrow my neighbor's Toro until it gets fixed. The good news is that it has a two year guarantee and I'm within that period."
3,Bad experience,"We ordered 2 of these, back to back. The first came with the handle bent, so that it would not slide up and down. The second came with an internal mechanism damaged so the deck did not go up and down. As these were new, I saw no reason to try to fix them, so sent them back. Both boxes (too flimsy for the product) had gashes and dents in them. Will I try again? It still had better reviews than the Homelite, so maybe."
4,Mostly satisfied,"This is actually my second Black & Decker cordless mower. The first lasted 8 years, was still cutting but didn't want to hold a charge any longer. Besides, it was pretty beaten up.I love the new one. It has power that lasts longer than the old one did even when new.I do worry, however, about the starter. It is plastic and doesn't feel strong enough to last more than a year or two. When it breaks off it will be a major undertaking to get it repaired, I'll bet.If you've got less than 1/4 acre and want to help the environment, go for this mower!"
2,poor engineering,"When my CMM1200 arrived from Amazon, the height adjustment was inoperable.I looked in the bottom of the box and found one of those cheap ""locking washers"". There's a bar that goes from the front wheel to the rear wheel that connects to the height adjuster. The bar had come loose from the shaft it attaches to. To re-attach the bar, one has to kneal on the front of the mower while lifting up on the rear of the mower until the hole in the bar lines up with the shaft. For the time being I re-installed the ""locking washer"", but my guess is that it will continue to fall off in use. Why Black and Decker didn't put a hole in the shaft with a pin is beyond me. If they can't get the little stuff right it concerns me as to the reliability of the rest of the mower."
4,Better then I expected !,"I was able to pick this mower up brand new off of ebay at a considerable discount last winter. I have been using it since the first cut of spring and....i really like it. No gas, no mess, no smell, no spark plugs. It has more than enough power for my yard(50X100)and i love the easy wheel adjustment which adjusts the whole deck at once. Quiet? Yes a bit quieter then the gas mowers, which is nice. I have had better cuts with gas mowers but i will not be taking out my gas mower again unless this thing breaks down. If the longevity is high with this mower i will consider it a wise purchase."
3,Hoping my new 'electric' mower would have been perfect.,"I bought this mower as a replacement for my old gas mower thinking it would save me money on gas and maintenance. After two uses and less than 15 days from delivery, it stopped working and is currently in the shop. It may be the mower battery, the charger or even something else that has a problem. I had to fix my old mower while I'm waiting for repairs.As far as comparison in actual mowing, it doesn't seem to have as much power as my old gas mower but does the job.Time will tell if this mower will by my 'perfect' mower or will continue to be problematic. I'm undecided if I would have made this purchase if I had known there may have been problems with this mower."
4,B&D 24-Volt Cordless,"This is my second B&D electric mower and it performs very will for an electric mower. The first mower lasted five years. It has plenty of mulching power as long as the grass is kept cut per their recommendations. My only complaint is the single handed actuation method; it is almost impossible to use anything but your right hand on the actuation lever. I've gotten used to it, but it's not nearly as convenient as the older model that had a lever going all the way across the handle."
2,Worked great for 1 season and then trigger broke off,"The ""switch-lever"" starts and stops the mower. After one season the handle broke while mowing and now we cannot start the mower. Also note that a small key unlocks the safety of the mower and we almost lost this in the grass once which would have also made the mower unusable."
1,Defective,"We recently ordered the new B&D CMM1200, in effort to jump on the green movement. Sadly, despite all of the excitement, the mower never started. After numerous charges, and numerous inspections (and much frustration), it was determined by the experts that the mower would never start, and it was a faulty piece of equipment. So, we lugged it back to UPS and proceeded to Sears and bought a trusty, gas guzzling mower, which works beautifully."
4,Quality Lawn mower,"Easy to set up and use, the cordless mower does away with gas/oil in the garage and long electric cords. So far a single charge has let me mow my entire lawn 1/4 acre with no problems. The grass catche is great if you dont want to mulch. And the best thing is all you have to do is roll it out and mow. No pull cords to start the motor, no gas or oil or other chenicals."
5,Easy Mowin',"I use this cordless electric mower to mow about 1/3 acre of smaller patches of a 2+ acre property that are too small and technical to mow with my larger tractor mower. It is always ready to use whenever I want to mow a section. It needs no gas, oil or fussing with except for occassional blade maintenance.It is clean, quiet and does a good job cutting rough weedy patches. I like that it is not self propelled because I get a bonus light workout while using it.I had an early version CMM1000 that I used very hard for about 8 years that only failed because I hit a large rock and damaged the motor shaft. I highly recommend this mower for anyone who uses a push gas mower. I suggest to B&D; that they market a solar charger as an accessory."
2,So So Mower,"April 30, 2012I have had this mower for 2 seasons now. The blade insulator failed after I hit something, it worked as expected but I had to wait for 3 weeks for Black & Decker to get this $2.37 part into their parts warehouse. The grass didn't stop growing over those 3 weeks. This is sloppy and unacceptable which means I will not purchase any Black & Decker product in the future.==I have been using the CMM1200 for 2 months now. I have a small area to mow so I can't speak to the battery time but I agree with what the others have said about this mower. It does a good job. One small thing, the rubber covering the handle bar is splitting at the curve so I cut it off just above the curve."
5,Very nice Mower - review after a year and after 4+years,"Good product. Mows a quarter acre lot on a single charge. Still in the first season of mowing so dont have a longer term record for the battery life. Quiet, a little heavy, havent had problems with the housing or key. Has a tougher time with tall/thick grass than a gas mower, but nothing that prohibits use. One handed adjustable height works well. Much more enjoyable to use than either a gas or reel (push) mower. After a year the battery is still going strong and this is the best mower I've ever owned.Update - 3 years later this mower is still doing great. Other than sharpening the blade it has required no maintenance and the battery has not had any problems mowing a 1/4 acre lawn.5 years in and the mower is still great - no problems with the battery and have had no maintenance issues at all."
3,great - but battery lasts 3-5years then $150 replace,I've had this mower (the 1000) for about 5 years and just had to replace the battery. Its available at batteries plus for about 150$. You have to open it up and unscrew everything and reconnect - there's no help for this in the manual. Now its like I have a new mower again. You have to make sure you dont let the battery run down to nothing before rechargin. I made this mistake usually and that may be why my battery ran down. It clearly states on the machine - dont let the battery run down past yellow and keep it on charge when not in use. Otherwise the mower is Ok and sure beats a stinky gas one which pollutes much more than a car and is noisy and you have to mix gas oil etc.They should make the battery much easier to replace and have material in the manual about how this is done.
3,"Good mower, but quite heavy","THe mower works really well, I have about 1/4 of an acre and it mows it totally fine on a single charge (in mulching mode) even when the grass is decently long. My only complaint is that it's a pretty heavy mower, if you have some serious hills, or have to lift it up stairs (in my case) and are not in decent shape you might have some trouble. That said, if you have a decently flat, 1/4 - 1/2 acre of grass..it's a good buy, it works great."
2,Not the best product,This lawnmower works ok as long as your grass does not grow much. I have a quarter acre of land to mow. This is much less than the 1/2 acre this lawnmower is supposed to handle. About half way through mowing the lawn the mower starts to loose power. After using the lawnmower six times I accidently dropped the charger and it broke on the inside without any visible damage. I called support and received little help in getting a replacement. They told me I would have to wait two months just to get a new charger. I would not buy this mower again!!
3,Electrical issue,I purchased the Electric Mower for our church. The price was good and all of the reviews that I read were very favorable. We were able to use it 2 times before the starter circut overheated and had to be replaced. You could see where the contact points for the key had burned and melted. The dealer I took it to was very helpful and is repairing it. The cutomer service phone center was not helpful. I was on hold for 20 minutes waiting for an operator. She asked for my phone number and when she diconnected us did not call back. She also was not helpful in trying to trouble shoot the problem. I had also tried to use the on-line service. They took 48 hours (during the week)to get back to me and had no answers. Black and Decker support is very poor. the 2 times we used the mower we were very happy.
5,Great Cordless Mower,"I love this electric mower! I have a large yard and purchased it mainly to do small mowing jobs around shrubs, trees the fenceline and areas too small to reach with the riding mower. This is exactly what I needed. Mows great and is so easy to start and use. I was so tired of trying to get gas powered mowers to start, especially at the beginning of each season. Also will be easy to store in the winter. I can't say enough about this mower. I am very, very pleased."
5,Great Electric Mower,This is my second rechargeable electric mower. Great performer. No need to store flammable gas and oil. Charges overnight. Comes installed. Green machine - saves the environment!
3,Heighth adjustment issue,"Out of the box, the mower's heighth adjustment mechanism wouldn't lock in place. I assume it was damaged in transit. I took it to a local electric repair shop that Black & Decker referred me to. They sent for a part and 2 weeks later I picked it up and took it home. I was trying to use it for the first time when the heighth adjustment slipped out and wouldn't lock again. The guys at the repair shop gave it another go and it worked this time. They were good guys at the repair shop and they did try to reassure that I hadn't bought a lemon. I tried it out and it worked fine. Much quieter than my gas powered mower. I try to roll with the punches in this kind of situation, and I thought there might be some humor in this back and forth. And I really want this mower to work for me. So overall it's still a work in progress. I'd love to give 5 stars, but can't just yet."
2,"Good idea, but poor-quality mower","Pros: relatively quiet operation, easy start (insert key and pull power handle), relatively easy to push and steer, mulching capability.Cons: I have a 1/3 acre lawn, but am only able to mow the front half or back half of my lawn, per charge. The plastic power handle is flimsy and has broken twice within the past year. Unit ""stalls"" when cutting tall grass (6-7-8""+) and lacks the power associated with gas-powered mowers. No remaining power/time indicator on mower. Need to overlap cutting path by almost 'half' in order to get a good cut/still leaves many uncut blades of grass."
4,Black & Decker Cordless CMM1200,"Nice little machine. Great for small flat yards. A little heavy when pushing up hills, and the small wheels don't help in this regard. The push handle could stand to have a little more adjustment. I am 6'4"" and have to hunch over a bit when pushing the mower, even when handle is at fully extended adjustment position. Otherwise, I am very pleased at never having to buy gas again, check the oil, or hurt my back pulling a starter cord."
1,Worst lawn mower ever,"Three weeks after receiving this product the ""reliable"" mower stopped working. There are perhaps four moving parts in it, and one of them snapped. Despite living in a city over almost 300,000 it was not possible to have it fixed anywhere so the mower had to be shipped across the state to a service center. The center took three weeks to fix the problem (a broken switch) and another week to find a box to ship it back! Upon opening the box I predictably found they had not shipped all the handle assembly back with the mower.So now, my $400 mower sits in the garage, my lawn continues to lengthen into a hay field and I cannot use it since they have not shipped the remaining parts to me. Black and Decker has not bothered to respond on this issue yet, and this has been the single worst yard/power tool purchase I have ever made. Save yourself the trouble and just buy a gas powered mower."
3,poor starter handle,"It mowed great, the battery power didn't last as long as advertised, and after a few uses there appeared to be smoke coming from the plastic safety starter area and the handle broke off and now it sits until I get it replaced."
2,BEWARE WARRANTY REPAIR,"Before buying this item beware of the issues involved with a warranty repair. I had my Black and Decker CMM1200 mower for only 4 months when the battery/charging system failed. The nearest factory authorized service was OVER 100 MILES AWAY. When I called Black and Decker's consumer '800' number, I was told to:A. Mail the mower to be repaired.B. Drive the mower to the service center for repair.c. Fix it myself and void the warranty.They finally relented and sent me a new mower. After a few hours of use and storing it over the winter THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN! I ended up returning this to Lowes who gave me a full refund towards a gas operated model.Needless to say, I will not buy any Black and Decker product again, EVER!"
4,"CMM1200 Black & Decker cordless 19"" mower ... NICE","What a difference from a gasoline mower. Loved my 20+ year old Honda, self-propelled, 21"" mulching mower. I mulched every root, leaf, and branch up to 1"" for years - but it was noisey, belched smoke, leaked oil, rattled & shook, and may well have self distructed soon, so off to the recycling center. The B&D is so light it needs no self-propel, very easy to adjust height, QUIET, uses no gas or oil (no more trips to the gas station due to an empty gas can - & no fumes in the car)... so no leaks. Never struggles to start after a long winter or on a cold day. BUT, is is a relative lightweight - no mulching branches, no powering through thick 3"" wet fall grass. Only 45 minutes of regular mowing (OK for my 0.25 acre yard if I mow before it gets too tall) Otherwise a great, GREEN choice."
4,Black & Decker CMM1200 Cordless Mower,The mower was purchased about a month ago & has been used several times with no problems. The lights on the battery charger that show when the battery has been charged are a good feature. Some design changes that would be helpful:* larger wheels would make the mower easier to push* it would help at times if the blade could be kept running when holding the handle with the left hand only* an onboard timer that would run when the blade is running would help to determine when the 1 hour of run time is up.
5,"Does the job, easy maintenance, highly recommend","I have had this mower for two years now and I love it. I'm a single woman with my own home, so I didn't want to mess with gasoline and oil. I also try to do everything I can to protect the environment. This mower is perfect for me. I leave it plugged in and it's ready to go when I'm ready to mow. I have a large yard, and it takes two or three hours to mow the whole thing. Generally, I do the front one day and the back the next, and I can spend over an hour mowing on one battery charge. The unit is light enough for me to be able to maneuver it through the back porch, over the patio, etc. The bagging is easy and quick. I love how I can just pull the handle to start the mower as I never seemed to have enough power or height to pull-start a gas mower. Also, I had back surgery and I don't have to worry about injuring myself now. Unless there is a new and improved product breakthrough, I won't ever switch from this mower style and brand."
4,Almost everything we wanted,"Getting up in years, my wife and I needed a less demanding lawn mower. So we bought this product. It is great in every way, except it is very heavy and will not pull itself. We realize that, for us, this was not the right choice. And, of course, buying it over the Internet, there is no way to return it and trade it in on something else."
1,Not recommended,"I purchased this product one year ago. Since that time it has 1. Refused to take a charge, 2. The cheap plastic ""switch lever"" broke, and 3. Today it refused to do less than half the lawn it would when new. This means one more trip into Seattle to have the batteries replaced [I hope] under warranty. It is also much heavier than the ""corded"" model due to the weight of the batteries."
2,terrible charger,"we only used this once then it won't charge anymore. we called customer service, was told charger is out of stock, have to wait for several weeks. now we have to find lawn mowing service which is not easy to find where we are at."
1,"Returned, Got Replacement, Returned Again, Purchased a Earthwise 20-Inch 24 Volt Cordless Electric","I am a big fan of Black & Decker products. In this case, it served to amplify my disappointment. The first unit was DOA, so I returned it. The second unit worked for a short period of time before it also needed to be returned.I just ordered an Earthwise 20-Inch 24 Volt Cordless Electric and I am hoping for a better experience.Earthwise 20-Inch 24 Volt Cordless Electric 3-in-1 Lawn Mower with Grass Bag #60020"
1,Weak mower,"Extremely weak pickup of cut grass, and just as bad with leaves. Need to mow the same ground twice to pick up trimmings. In rapid growth periods expect to need to mow the yard two or three times each week, or the mower will bog down and leave very excessive cuttings. This was Black and Deckers last chance with me. I'm done buying anything they make."
1,Not worth Price,I bought this to replace 8year old cmm1000. which I had loved. This thing was cheaply made took longer to charge then did not last very long before needing a recharge.As my lot is a 1/4 acre and house +drive along with patio take up alot of it this mower should have done it in one charge after 4 charges I returned mower. Thank God PG&E did a promo with Neuton mowers. I traded in my broked cmm1000 in pieces and I like the Neuton mower alot.
2,Good idea But needs more work,"I have this mover for a year because I'm faithful. Not because it a great mower. It doesn't give enough charge in one session. It takes two to three days to complete the grass cutting at my suburd house. The bag needs to be empty in between. And the wheel are medium to small. It gets stopped by the small clumps of grass. Great idea for the enviornment, just needs improvement. Especially for the price."
3,difficult to push and maneuver,"I bought this mower back in the fall and yes, it does all the good things it is described to do, no gas or oil, pull the lever with one finger and it starts, easy to charge and the height adjustment is effortless. The fatal flaw is that it is so heavy that by the time you are finished pushing and pulling the thing around you are whipped. I used to practically be able to run behind my little gas mower but this thing feels like the wheels are not oiled or something. It is very difficult to push and maneuver around trees. It doesn't turn well because it is so long, and lifting the back up to turn will wear you out. I wish I had known this before hand and waited until they came out with a self propelled version."
1,Frustrated over worthless warranty,"I purchased the mower in early June - during the second mowing - the battery did not seem to have charged completely. When I plugged the charger in again - no light! I called Black & Decker - the techie told me"" the charger is on back order until August 6."" I called on August 6th to make sure it had shipped and was told -""It is now on backorder until mid September"" After going through a couple of supervisors trying to get a new mower shipped to me - I have now turned it over to my credit card company by contesting the charge. B&D's warranty states they will ""repair or replace"" at their option. My opinion - IF YOU CANNOT GET A PART FOR 3 MONTHS you can't repair it - SO REPLACE IT!!! This company is not standing behind their product! Buysomething else!"
4,My Bag Full Sensor Isn't Reliable,"Hi All,My mower and battery are working very well.We have a pool so the rear bagging is important for us.The sensor stops the mower long before the bag is full.Sometimes a few steps after the last empty.....Any suggestions on how to tune up the sensing system?Thanks in advance."
3,Great concept! Maintenance a hassle.,"I loved using this mower for the first year or two (even though my lawn was probably too big for it). I could do my whole lawn in 3(-4) charges.Later the power got weak, and I needed more than 5 charges. Since I live in a small rural town, I had to ship it out of state for maintenance & replaced both batteries. It still can't do my lawn in just 4 charges.Now the trigger/handle broke off (a simple mechanical problem, probably due to non-durable plastic parts), and I will again have to ship this out of state for repair.I still really like the concept, and wish I could still say I loved it, but getting it fixed is a headache. Perhaps this technology is still too new for where I live (not their fault, but I hope they could share their repair tech). Some of the construction (plastic trigger) should be built more sturdily."
5,Greatest lawn mower I've ever owned,"This is the greatest lawn mower I've ever owned. It cuts great and is very easy to use. I can mow my entire lawn without the battery dying.The only bad thing is it requires it be plugged in all the time to keep the battery healthy. I didn't have a power outlet near the shed. Luckily, I had some space in my garage."
2,Disappointed,"this mower was much harder to push than i expected it would be...i think older people (in my case 76)would benefit from some self-propelled help with this mower...wheel adjustment works well...charging system works well...and, of course it is easy starting! our mowing area has a slight slope and is especially tough when one has to go up the slope for short distances...we have several black & decker products and this is the very first that we haven't been highly satisfied with...ed mansfield...[...]"
2,Heavy not powerful,"Pros:1)no maintenance2)if it bogs down, it will start up again automatically (it doesn't stall)3)easy height adjustmentCons:1)heavy. It weights 30 lbs more than most corded or gas mowers, but yet isnt self propelled. It is LABORIOUS turning this thing2)uneven cut. It likes to miss grass on the edge of its cutting path3)it bogs down on grass any gas mower would blow through.4)barely cuts 1/4 of an acre if there is much thick grass.5)expensive! Reasonable self-propelled gas mowers are this price!!!This all boils down to a mower that doesn't actually do what it supposed to do very well and that its make cutting grass easier. My old self propelled honda was easy to use.I will probably return this for a corded electric with lots of amps."
1,Save your money...look elsewhere,"Definitely not worth the price when you can have twice as much mower for half as much money. Here's why:1) does not handle rough terrain at all. and i dont mean big hills and bumps. ANY bump or change in elevation (i.e. 6 inches) will give you fits trying to push this thing through2) poorly designed and made - starter broke twice in the first 2 months i had it. Cut height adjustment broke in month 1. does not mulch properly or finely enough3) impossible to navigate the B&D; customer service line. took me 10 minutes of maneuvering to get a live rep. Guess my engineering degree and 10+ years of business experience dont help when it comes to that MENSA designed phone systemIt does have some pros in that it is quiet and does hold its charge fairly well. But, all in all, electric mowers are just not ready for the mainstream yet. Get a decent gas powered, self propelled mower for less $$ and wait a few years for the electrics to come around4)"
1,Worst lawnmower I've ever owned,"I've had this mower for about two years now. I enjoyed it at first because I didn't have to keep gas in the garage and it's really quiet. However, this thing performs about as poorly as they come. I have a pretty small yard, and a full charge got me through my backyard and about two minutes of the front before it died. Now as I type I'm sitting in my living room waiting for it to charge enough to where I can finish my friggin' lawn!Another bad thing about this mower is that it completely stops when you get to any kind of growth whatsoever. If the grass is thick and two inches tall, forget about it.I borrowed my neighbors gas, self-propelled mower last month and it was amazing how much better it was. I'll probably give this thing away soon and purchase a real, gas mower."
2,Needs improvement,"I purchased the CMM1200 last year on clearance from Sears. On the first mowing, the battery died before finishing the spring grass on my 1/4 acre lot. The next charge took it a little further, but not enough to finish the area. The mower was not able to finish until the grass dried out a bit in the summer. I lowered the cut setting in the late summer, and when I went over the round surface of a concrete drainage pipe, the blade glanced the pipe. The blade cut into the soft plastic under plate and jammed the motor. A steel mower would have survived my mistake, but not this one. I had to cut away a section of the under plate, tape the hole, and order a new blade. Now I admit it was my mistake, but mowers need to be built to survive a common mishap like this... I do not recommend this mower unless the lot is very small and you are a very careful person."
5,Excellent Mower,plugged it in the day it arrived and used it the next day. It did my entire lawn on one charge. have been using it for 1 month now (4 full lawn mowings) with no issues. turns on and off with the flip of a single lever. height adjustment is smooth and easy. I will never use a gas mower again.
1,VERY unstable product drivers,"This product is OK when it works, but how often is that? I would not buy it again if I had to do over.In the middle of mixing songs, it gives me the blue screen of death more often than not. One would be better off going with an interface that has reliable drivers that work."
3,Sleep Issue Still Exists with Vista SP1,In case anyone wonders - the issue with going into sleep mode still exists when using this product with Window Vista Service Pack 1 (in my case on a Dell Inspiron E1705). If you try to put your compute in sleep mode it will hang forever with the US-122 plugged in. Unplug it before going into sleep mode and all is well.I guess this problem will never be fixed which is a shame. Otherwise the device has worked flawlessly for me - this is really the only problem with it.I am disappointed that Tascam never addressed this issue and do not plan to buy any further devices from them.
1,Windows XP system crashes from US-122 driver,"I have yet to succeed in loading and using this device due to the fact that my new Dell 8400 with XP Pro continously crashes when I open the software. It also made my system unstable in other ways. Is it compatible? So far for me, the answer is no. I'm currently searching for a fix.I'll grant you, I am not a tech savvy person, but I'm not an idiot, either. It's been difficult for me to find a fix for this problem at Windows Update or Tascam's site."
3,"""Click OK anyway""","This product does not meet the ""Microsoft standards"", and your computer will tell you this as you are installing the product. Of course, this is probably not mentioned in the product description. What are the Microsoft standards? Well, I don't know, but I would assume that a quality product would meet them. It says in the instruction manual that during installation, it's okay to tell your computer to install the software even though it doesn't meet the standards. This happens if you update the driver, too. Of course, the warning on your computer will say how this could damage your computer."
5,Very Nice Overview of the JMT,"I recommend this film to anyone who has hiked or plans to hike the John Muir Trail. It follows a group of high school students with limited backpacking experience on a north-south trek of the JMT as well as some very insightful discussion by a Yosemite park ranger about Yosemite, the Sierra, and the JMT and what makes them all so special. A very nice overview of the trail."
3,Okay,Was looking for something ath perhaps showed more sites and scens from the trail and not about the difficulties of hiking the trail.
3,So-so,Wasn't impressed with the quality and looks of this shoe. It's been a while since I bought a pair of Sebagos and thought I'd give this shoe a try. One look at the sole told me the materials were less than durable. I didn't even try it on - simply scheduled a return and sent it back....
4,sebago men's classic moc,very good quality leather and craftsmanship. shipping was quick and the price is great!one thing though that i don't like about the shoes is that the heels were nailed to the shoes and it gets quite slippery on tiled floors
3,shoesheights shoes,I would have like the shoes to be just a little softer....but I can be quite satified with what I got for my value. People look at the shoes and say how nice they look.
1,Low quality Sebago Loafers,"Recently bought a pair of Sebago Loafers via Amazon.com. Over USD 100 and quality?? A DISASTER!! After one day of wearing the 'antique brown' color already faded on several parts and became pink-red - especially on the parts that bend somewhat during walking. Since then I didn't wear these awfull products anymore. IS THIS US QUALITY??? A SHAME, I MUST INFORM YOU!! Be aware."
3,Undersized,"These are beautiful penny loafers. However, they run narrow and short. The pair I ordered were 10 E. They were at least 1/2 size short and I wear an E (wide) and narrow. I had to return them and am nervous about reordering them to get the sizing correct. So I just went elsewhere.Otherwise they are nicely made and I'd wear them regularly - - if I could get them to fit."
2,Small and narrow and tight!,"Still trying to stretch them enough with shoe trees to get them on. I did read here that they ran small, so I got an 11 instead of my normal 9-1/2 wide or 10.They seem like nice shoes, to look at and all.<edit> After a few months.I did get the local cobbler to stretch them, and I wear them daily - but they were a struggle to get on for a while. I can't take 'em off on a plane flight longer than an hour or so if I want to get them back on. Wore through the soles in just three weeks of walking (in fairness, it was cobblestones in Europe). Got new compo half-soles, and they wear like iron.They are broken in and comfy now, but it took a while!"
4,"Good shoes at a great price, too small","These shoes were on sale at a great price in the style I like. They arrived in less than a week,I liked the quality and finish; however, the shoe size seems to run small."
4,Nice shoes,"Nice Shoes. Good fit, good quality materials. I can use this shoes in almost every occasion. Good value for the price."
2,"Sebago Men's Classic Leather Loafer, just too narrow!","These are very nice, well-made leather loafers, but they are way undersized. I wear an 11 eee in this shoe and I have a few pair of them in the Cayman II series which fit nicely after a brief break in period. I couldn't even get into these classic loafers. They fit like an 11 D, so they were returned. The rolled stitching on the sides pulls the shoe in too much and doesn't flex allowing a decent fit."
5,Best shoes ever,Best shoes ever: the first time you put them on you feel like they have been always yours. I love them.
3,Nice shoe but fit is narrow,"I have a narrow foot and finding anything but D or E widths has become nearly impossible at local malls and box stores. I saw these Sebagos on Amazon and thought I would give an Internet order a shot since we have Prime for shipping and they were offering free returns. I ordered these and a pair of New Balance and both arrived separately in a couple days without problem. The Sebago seems to be solidly built, but runs narrower than the indicated size. I ordered my usual B and it felt like I needed a C. The length seemed fine, though so it may just be the way they cut this style.Unfortunately, the New Balance were off sized on their length so both pair have to go back. Amazon only provided one return shipping label even though they sent the stuff in two separate boxes. Amazon, you need to update your returns process to match how you ship the order. Most of us don't have a ready supply of boxes to repackage stuff. 3 stars for that."
5,Continued Satisfaction,"I've worn Sebago loafers for 30 years. The leather is thick and the stitching is strong. This makes for a well supported foot. The curvature at the back of the shoe is such that you will not walk out of them. They take a long time to break in, but once they are, they are like your old blue jeans. I get them repaired with half soles and heels at a local cobbler and so I get many years of life out of a single pair. This was the first time I've bought them from Amazon, and it has worked out well, but then I know my size in this shoe well."
4,Very good quality,"They were a little bigger than I expected, good quality though. nnmb nb nb nb bn nb nb nb nb"
4,As expected,"I've had the same model in another color, and this black pair is the same: Not spectacular, but well made, they fit, and it is what I bargained for."
2,Too small,"The shoes are quite stiff out of the box. They look great, but I'm afraid I can't try them on. I've worn 10 1/2D for 30 years,and yet I could not get either shoe on, even with a shoe horn and a thin sock. I'd estimate the size at closer to 9 1/2. Given their stiffness, I've opted out of reordering in a larger size. Even if appropriately labeled, breaking a pair in would likely be a painful process."
2,Not your classic Sebago loafer,"I purchased in succession several pairs of the Sebago loafer back in the 1980s and 1990s. The shoes were then made in the US, as I recall. Each pair fit properly and took only a few days to break in. The leather was sturdy and good for several re-sole jobs. The finish was gorgeous with some of the leather's grain showing through, giving much depth to the finish.Today, the shoes are made overseas. The opening to insert your foot is now shorter and the shoe will no longer accommodate my high arch. The finish looks more like paint than polish. I can't comment on the quality of the leather or the soles, for I couldn't get my foot inside to wear them. A few years ago I wore a similar Sebago model (the Sherman) which had a rubber instead of a leather sole; the leather uppers on these failed after about 1 year.Classic?, I don't think so."
2,Brilliant Man...Average Book,"I first read about Jack Parsons in the L.A. Times and it got me intrigued. When I bought the book I thought it was going to be filled with nothing but his eccentricities and that's wanted I wanted to read. But it got real technical. Pages of his U.S patents which I did not find interesting. The author did his homework as far as the smallest details of Parson's life. Going so far as to tell you where Parsons lived (and dates of residency) and he moved quite a bit. I did enjoy reading about the relationship he had with Alister Crowley and L. Ron Hubbard which portrays him (Hubbard) as a con man he is. Basically, it's a technical book that I feel didn't quite hit the mark."
4,"Explore the connections between the space program, the occult and science fiction","This was a good read but I get the feeling that the full story of Parsons will never be known. Parsons was a rocket scientist who was one of the pioneers in the field. He was heavily into the occult, a protege of Aleister Crowley as well as L. Ron Hubbard. Hubbard later went on to swindle Parsons out of a large sum of money but not before he and Parsons conducted the infamous ""Babylon Working"" ceremonial magic rituals. Parsons died by blowing himself up at his home labratory which was ruled an accident but considering Parsons was the worlds greatest authority on rocket fuel at the time of his death many believe that he was set up and murdered. Most people really have no clue as to how much overlap there has always been been between the space program, the occult and science fiction. This book is one to dig into if you want to explore those connections."
2,Not for most readers,"I was intrigued by an article in a newspaper that summarized Jack Parson's unique life, citing this book as a source of information. As a scientist, knowing some aerojet and JPL people where Jack worked, and having spent a few years nearby in Pasadena, this book looked promising.For me it was unreadable. Even though I have enjoyed many wacky books along the lines of the Illuminatus Trilogy, science fiction, and biography, the mumbo-jumbo here got in the way of the story.Specifically, over-interpretations of events that were doubtless coincidences and pointless odd mystical digressions drained the reality and the flow from the narrative. The author should have better separated fact and plausible interpretations from his own offbeat ideas, as likely applies to his subject, as well."
2,Sex and Rockets: The Occult World of Jack Parsons,"Jack Parsons helped set the foundation for rocketry in the USA. He also delved into the occult, thinking he was the Anti-Christ and he was intensely into sex. The book also shows the sleazy side of the Scientology founder, L. Ron Hubbard."
3,I can see why the author didn't want to use his real name,"A fascinating character rendered lifeless by the author. I knew I was in trouble when the book started with gems such as ""...young John Parsons was born..."". By definition, everybody is young when they are born, no need to point it out. The book reads like an essay written for English 121.5 stars for Jack Parsons. -2 stars for John Carter's flaccid writing. 0 stars for RAWs embarrassing introduction."
2,Fascinating - but poorly written,"An absolutely fascinating story about the world of Jack Parsons, both his rocket expertise and his journey into the occult. Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard puts in a brief appearance as a shadowy occultist and con man. The book suffers, unfortunately, from being poorly written and presented. The scientific sections have all the charm of a Unix manual, and the occult sections are tedious - too heavy on the fine points of arcana and not enough on the human foibles and interactions."
1,A surprisingly dull book.,"Clearly Parsons was a fascinating character, and yet 'John Carter' manages to be boring. The seemingly endless recitations of the minutiae of various arcane rituals, the terms used without any reference, all wears on you after a while. In the end I took away no novel information about Parsons's occult beliefs or whether/how it related to his engineering skill, only the strong impression that he was a gullible sort of man who'd believe anything, an easy mark for con artists like Crowley and Hubbard. I'm not sure that's a fair reading of his character, or just a byproduct of a tedious and unsuccessful biography."
4,A tantalizing view of a misunderstood man,"_Sex and Rockets_ is a fascinating look at the mundane and occult experiences of Jack Parsons. The most interesting thing about the book (and the man) is that very juxtaposition: here was someone deeply involved in the mystical pursuit of initiation, yet at the same time he passionately drove a paradigm-shifting effort in the infant rocket industry. One might expect the two vocations to collide, and it is likely they did; but the Resistance generated from his twin loves surely fueled his comprehension of the nature of existence and ultimately the force that consumed him: BABALON. A groundbreaking work about one of the least understood figures in recent occult memory, it is worth reading and digesting by those who continue to be intrigued by his work."
1,don't get scammed,"I think at least 2 of the 5-star reviewers below are ringers. One of them ""reviewed"" 13 other books in the same genre and every single one of them contained a glowing reference to this book. Another had a similar cut-and-paste job where all his reviews were the same, advertising 5 more crappy books. After reading this book I couldn't understand how anyone could rate it so highly... it's just plain bad."
2,Not As Advertised,This product does not accurately read methanol percentages. The meter jumps up and down and is difficult to read. We tested it in our lab because our field people complained so much. Finaly we decided to return them.
4,Good price,"I have not used the strings yet, they were purchased with some tuning machines for a bass I am building, but I have used other D'Addario bass strings before and liked them. Both the tuning machines and these strings were purchased at a very good price and I am happy with the purchase."
4,Great bass strings,"I like these bass strings a lot, they give me the variety of sounds that I may need while playing different types of music. Excellent value as well."
4,D'Addario Bass Strings,Great bang for the buck. Sound nice and crisp on my 1972 Fender Precision. Would more than likely order these strings again.
2,so so,"movie is only marginally okay. anyway, i bought it to see Mira Sorvino. LOVE SORVINO and Replacement Killers was really good. guess she can only hope that movies she signs on for turn out well. this one is not really worth watching unless you like Sorvino like i do."
5,Great Resource for pastured poultry.,After seeing this done on a farm in Ky thought I would try myself. This book has been a good resource on Pastured Poultry. Although I consider myself pretty knowledgeable in poultry I learned many things from the book. It is a little old but by far the majority of information stays the same. We are using the system and it does work well. I would highly recommend.
5,Great Book!,"I really enjoyed this book for a number of reasons. First the author is truly an inspiring person. His common sense approach to life is awesome. This was the first book i read by Joel. Three books later I am still buying more!. Pasture Poultry Profits covers the good, bad, and ugly of raising chickens. It covers everything Joel and his family have learned over 20+ years. It even lists the composition of the feed and why each item is used. I believe raising broilers to be the prefect way to break into a farming enterprise."
4,Beginner's Bible,"All in all, a completely comprehensive view of pasturing poultry from the man who in essence started it all, Joel Salatin. The only problem I have with it is that he needs to go through and update it, as it was written in the '90s and the birds have evolved, giving us a new set of nutritional challenges. WELL WORTH THE MONEY for the beginner interested in getting into the business!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Pretty good book!,"I like this book ok. I have a few problems with it though. It doesn't read very smoothly, seems the author goes back and forth between active and passive voice. I had to re-read sentences quite often. As far as the information goes, it seems that the author has found the one and only way to pasture chickens and he lets you know it. Now, maybe he has, I don't know. I will be using a lot of his advice and methods, but not all. Overall, I'm glad to have this book."
5,Step by step detailed instruction on running a business,"Joel provides step by step detail simplifying start up and running of a pastured poultry business. Great instruction, detailed numbers - sharing real information to make you successful. Love this book!!!"
2,outdated too basic info,"I have in the past raised tractor chickens & beef and after a slow down in our main income source have decided to do some of this again.Although this book has some good pointers for the very new farmer, the info for marketing is outdated and written before this writer had any knowlege of the best marketing tool of our time.... the internet.Frankly, that is what I expected to find here and there was nothing but folksy ""sell off the farm marketing"", which certainly has its place but is antiquated and the author has a touch of old fashioned farmer arrogance, which is too common in this field and certainly not helpful. I found this for the most part to be too simple, boring and a waste of money."
1,Save Your Money,"Bookie Loc is a very talented MC with a unique voice. However, the beats on this album destroy the album. He was great when he was with NBK, but with the beats on this album, it's just not worth it at all."
2,Great idea - poor construction,"We received this item as a gift from grandma because my son loves barnyard animals, barns, etc. He LOVES the tent; however, the construction was so poorly thought out that he cannot touch it without it falling over and collapsing on top of him! There is no way to anchor it to the floor (weights, etc.) to keep it from toppling over. The sides have no stabilization whatsoever.The idea is super, but maybe they should consider more product testing to ensure its durability."
1,Cheap,"The tent is extremely flimsy, has no bottom to it and falls over all the time. It will not stand straight up. Could have bought a better child's tent at a cheaper price."
2,We returned it,"The barn is really cute and tall for older kids. However, it does not ""pop"" up, there are three rods you have to put in and out when putting it up and down. Also, once put together, it stood crooked, so it would not stay up. If you got it just right, it would remain standing, until one of the kids went into it. I am talking a 19 month old, not a 12 year old crashing it. Needless to say, we sent it back and will look for something better. OH, send it back via Amazon. The company called me back after a full week, and wanted $15 included with the returned tent (shipping on you). Things that make you say hmmmmmm."
2,Pop-up Play Barn,Gave this to my 4-year-old niece for Christmas and she played with it for a while then moved on. It's small; really just big enough for her and a few toys. Easy pop-up and break down; great for small places and small people.
2,Misleading information provided,"I bought this product on dicember and according to the size specifications mine size was supossed to be 9.5M, however, when i got the package i realized that it was too big and needed probably an 8.5M so as per the Amazon return policy on regards to exchanges, replacements and/or returns they were to be handled by Kenneth Cole, so i contacted them as soon as i had them and they replied to me saying it was ok to be done so i send the boots over to them but then they sent them back to me because they said i had to deal with Amazon as i bought them from them, i called them and they didn't wanna deal with me basicaly as i called like 5 times to get it done and sent me back to Amazon...so i have no place to go now with a pair of boots that does not fit my feet because of the misleading information we all are given by Amazon."
5,A great little thriller,"The title through me off for a minute but Ms. Dennis writes a taut and suspenseful thriller.Early on you knew Mia thought she had a stalker but the kidnapping happened so fast. Good character explanations and development. Along with wondering when and how she would get away, the setting and the torture was torture. The reader felt like they were there in that.......... Wonderful thriller. I enjoyed it. It was a rollacoaster ride. I want all my sistahs in my bookclub, In the Company of My Sistahs to read the book."
5,Great feel-good book to help get through miscarriage,"This book was good in that it helped to show it IS okay to feel how you feel after miscarriage, even if 20 years later. The pain doesn't go away- you just learn to deal."
5,Heartbreaking and excellent,"This is an excellent book to read following a miscarriage. After having a miscarriage, you may not know how to feel or if what you feel is normal. You may not know how to handle your grief. Others may make you feel that what you experienced is not a true loss. This book helps in all these aspects. It is also helpful for others close to someone that has miscarried such as spouse, family, friends and health care workers to read."
5,Excellent book! Good for 1st trimester miscarriages.,"I was looking for a book that would help me process what has happened to me and my family emotionally. I didn't want a book on preventing miscarriage or the medical reasons WHY I had a miscarriage. I feel like I know that already. I needed a book that described what women went through and experienced. I needed someone to tell me that I am not alone and that many women feel the way I do. I also needed a book that would allow me to mourn my loss.Having a miscarriage is horrible. It is devastating. This book describes all the emotions and feelings. I don't wish a miscarriage on anyone. We experienced a 1st trimester loss 3 weeks ago. This book has done amazing things to help me process, validate, and accept what has happened. Thank you for writing this book!"
4,Wonderfully caring book,"A wonderfully caring book from two women who have each suffered a miscarriage.Feelings on various subjects from how we are treated by friends & family, to the medical profession, pain and blood, and everything associated with losing a baby.Helpful for getting in touch with your own feelings, accepting them, accepting yourself."
2,Reads Like A Text Book,"This book felt clinical and cold. It explored the variety of reactions and full range of emotions couples experience during miscarriage. While there were quotes from parents interspersed throughout the book, there was more psycho-babble than first-hand stories. If you are trying to heal from pregnancy loss, skip this book and leave it for someone trying to secure a degree in counseling. I did not find it helpful in comforting my pain."
1,Really Bad,I thought this book was designed merely to exploit peoples misfortune. It was very poorly written and never should have been published.
5,"Love them, but like the individual pieces better","I have looked EVERYWHERE for the individual, single-flavor boxes of Jolly Rancher cherry flavor. Does anyone know if this format has been discontinued? I love the Stix, but you can't always take them along for a quick, unobtrusive snack."
2,Sent me old product,So far I have opened about 10 of the stix and all of the package sticks to the jolly rancher. I am guessing this is due to the product being old. No matter how carefully I try to open it I end up try to pick off and scratch away the wrapper from the jolly rancher. Not happy with my purchase!
5,Quite good!,"The Jolly Rancher candy is some of my favorite as a child, but next time I will pick the Cherry twists, rather than the stix. I find the smaller piece does better, and not so much sugar. I share these with my daughter."
5,You CANNOT go wrong with Jolly Ranchers!,"I love these! I've loved these for many, many years. Now, if I could find the individually wrapped candies that's completely cherry flavor instead of the mixed flavors without having to break the bank, I'd be a happy camper!I've bought these and the individually wrapped apple pieces twice and pass them out to friends. I am considered the ""Jolly Rancher Lady"" to many people. :)I'll be making another purchase soon, as I am almost running out.Enjoy!"
3,2/3 Jolly Ranchers Broken,"Even with having the film on the outside of the box, and being individually wrapped the majority of the Jolly Ranchers were broken. It was hard to tell this by just looking at the box, you can't really tell until you get everything unwrapped. Besides being broken, the Jolly Ranchers were as advertised, all cherry (the best flavor) and there were 36 in the box."
3,Every Christian who loves the Jewish people should read this.,"I thought I was getting a book about the Bible's top 50 ideas but right from the first chapter I did not get the Bible's top 50 ideas but the Jewish culture's top 50 ideas through their traditional thought and other sources other than the Bible. I had always believed that the Torah and the rest of the Old Testament was sufficient for the Jews because it is the voice of God speaking to them but after reading this book I realized that it is not so. So Christians if you really want to understand the Jewish mind read this book. Compare it with scripture, but read it."
5,Quick and easy installation. Look great.,"First, although the description states they are for the 2002-2006 Trailblazer, they also fit the '07 and '08 - I installed them on my 2008 Trailblazer (note that they do not fit the extended versions of the truck).These were very easy to install...simply clean around the window where they will be placed, peel the backing off the double side tape affixed to the visors, place on the vehicle, and press. If it is below 50 degrees outside when you install, you may want to use a hair dryer to warm the metal on the vehicle to assure adhesion.They add a nice, subtle look to the vehicle as well as allow you to keep your windows open an inch or two in the rain, allowing for good ventilation in the vehicle."
4,Great change from Knockout Kings,"First off let me say those people that complain about the Total Punch Control being way too hard...CHANGE THE CONTROLLER SETTINGS THEN!!! Total Punch Control is hard, but you can get the hang of it. It took me a while to get it, but ultimately it's kinda cool. And even so, you can change it so the regular buttons are the punches.Either way this is a good game. The career mode is cool and has enough to keep you going for quite some time and the difficulty levels are good enough for a challenge. I started on easy to get the hang of it and it was easy at first, but as I started to climb the ranks I actually had some tough fights. I've now moved on to medium and it's definitely tougher.All in all it's the best boxing game out there and just give it a chance. If you don't like Total Punch Control, just change the settings."
4,boxing bonanza,Good graphics. I like the boxers that are in the game. There are some old timers in there.
4,Boxing game done right,"Just had the game a couple of days and enjoying every minute. I agree with some of the other reviews on the clinching it should be an option, it's just apart of boxing and should be included. Also, lets get a real annoucer but I loved the soundtrack. Also, get ready for sore thumbs the game is addictive, but the toggles will wear your thumbs out (don't get me wrong no pain, no gain). It's a must buy for the boxing fan, sports fan, the game fan. Can't wait to see the improvments for the 2005 version."
2,A couple fell apart within hours of opening...SMALL PIECES,"We bought these for our 3 yr old. I wasn't too thrilled when one of the little wheels came off soon after opening the package. Also a couple of the characters popped off their wheel base (super glue repaired both problems). Though since gluing them back together nothing else has come apart, I'm still cautious about them b/c my son still tends to put things in his mouth. Their really not worth the money. He hardly plays with them at all. He probably wouldn't even miss them if I took them."
3,no customer support,"Beware that there is only e-mail customer support for free. All telephone support is for a fee and they are usually not there, nor do they return your call."
1,DOESN'T WORK!,"It says it does ""double-sided"" and ""folding"" cards right on the back of the box. There are no ""double-sided"" or ""folding"" card instructions not even in their PDF manual downloaded from their site. The ONLY way to get any help is through their discussion boards that they say they will respond to in one day. Good luck. When I copied in my logo, it stuck right in the center and spread to the edges closest to it. Couldn't select it, move it, resize it, nothing. None of the basic shapes that you can copy, squares, circles, etc. worked. I WILL FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO USE! This is very frustrating and a complete waste of my $30 which by they way they won't refund OF COURSE!"
1,not happy,"It was not compatible with my version of mac osx , which makes it useless. Their was no way of knowing this as there was no info as to os compatibly ."
4,"Fascinating look at ""advice sharing"" between famous friends","Even the famous need a sounding board..a friend who will listen and sometimes advise. Rowan, the popular straight-man of the 60's hit TV show ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh In"" finds his attentive ""ear"" via correspondence with novelist John D. Macdonald. Their letters, gathered by MacDonald, aptly describe Rowan's fight with fame, his partner, and success. True Travis McGee followers will want this volume in their collection simply because, on occassion, MacDonald quotes Meyer--McGee's intellectual friend--when offering advice and wisdom to Rowan. A hard to find book, but one worth looking for."
5,Big hit as a gift !,"I did not read this myself, but purchased all three books for my 11 year old daughter. She read all three books within a week, and has raved about them."
5,A must read for all teenage girls,"This is one of my favorite books of all time and one every teenage girl should pick up at some time or another. Brashares skillfully weaves together the tale of 4 very different girls' adventures over one summer bringing them together by the means of a magical pair of pants representing their friendship. while the idea of the magical pair of pants may seem a bit farfetched to some, this story couldn't be more true to teenage life. Both humorous and heartwrenching, i enjoyed every page of this book. i especially enjoyed the quotes that appeared at the beginning of each chapter. i think every girl can relate to one of the characters in some way or another. I find it almost scary how much i can relate to Lena. My two best friends (who are a lot like Tibby and Carmen) also love this book and we've started our own sisterhood v. similar to the one in the book, which has made us even better friends."
4,Read in One Day!,"Sisterhood of the traveling pants is about 4 teenage friends; Lena, Tibby, Bridget and Carmen. Who will be spending their first summer apart. Carmen bought a pair of jeans at a local thrift shop. One day before they were all to leave for their first summer apart. The pants were found in the back of Carmen's closet where she threw them not thinking about them again. Soon all the girls were trying on the pants. These magical pants fit all the girls perfectly, Even though all the girls have very different body types. The night before they were supposed to leave they made a pact to share the pants over the summer. Hence the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is born. As each girl has the pants something special is destin to happen to them.I realize this book is for young adult readers, but anyone who loves a book on friendship would love this book. It will take you back in time to when you were a teenager and friendship was the most important thing in your life."
3,A Light Airy Read!!!!,This was a ok novel I am not much into the norm when it comes to novels but this was definetely an ok read but it was slow and very superficial. I don't understand all the fuss that was made over this novel it really was nothing special it was like almost every other teen book in print but if you love friendships and travel and romance then you would definetely like this novel.
5,Could'nt put the book down!,"Wow, this is a great book that I couldn't put down. I can't imagine how you can think it's not appropriate for 12-year-olds. I'm a 11-year-old and I totally understand it. The only sexual content has is that Bridget thinks that it would be nice to have sex with this boy. No intimate details about it or anything. The people that are saying it's inappropriate are those overprotective parents who theink their children shouldn't be exposed to the real world. God, if they think this is bad, I'd like to see what they think about ""Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret?"" BOTTOM LINE: AWESOME BOOK!!!"
5,The Sisterhood of The Traveling Pants,"The Sisterhood of The Traveling Pants is funny, and all the girls have alot of love and friendship. It is a very moving story about four girls and how their friendship over the summer stays so strong while they are all staying in a different state."
5,"Wonderful story, beautifully written","Funny, fresh, poignant, real. I loved each girl's story, and especially how the girls related to each other--supportive but challenging too.I can't wait until my daughters are old enough to read and appreciate this book. In the meantime, it's on my Xmas list for old friends and new.BTW--I found this in the teen section. I would love to see this be considered a mainstream book--the writing is excellent, and the storytelling superb."
4,Sisterhood was what I expected,"I enjoyed the storyline, it was interesting how the girls all came together and shared a common bond. The twists were interesting"
1,Courtney's Review,"I did not enjoy this book I prefer books with mystical creatures and magic. If I had an option i would not have read, It is about 4 girls who split up for the summer and face diffrent problems. Any girls who are having problems with splitting up with their friends might want to read this."
2,Not the best book,"This book was ok, but most of the time I was bored to death. I think that two of the girls' story was pretty good the the other two were extremely boring."
3,A big but....,"As a young adult librarian, I'm always happy to see a decent book that gets kids reading. I think this is a good book for the intended audience and recommend it but, unlike the magic pants that cover any size butt, the author has given one character a big problem without covering it. One of the characters is clearly bipolar and heading for trouble. It's veiled but seems clear that her mother had the same disease and committed suicide yet none of her friends or the adults around this girl appear to realize she's ill. The author has a sequel to this book coming out in a few months where I hope she brings the character's illness to the forefront. However, I think she should have written something into -this- book to show awareness of a serious problem to get kids thinking about themselves or others as she did by presenting other hard problems teen girls have to deal with."
1,One of the Dumbest Books Ever!,"This is really the cheesiest book I have ever read. Why would anybody make up rules that you have to follow while you are wearing the sacred pants? Don't we get enough of these already?! And also - you make your future, not what you wear. Don't read this book! It's wasting your time!"
2,Do not read this!,"I spent more than 7 dollors to buy this book and it was not worhtit. I thought i could relax and read a decent story, but i couldn't stand 5 pages of this cheesy and naive story!"
1,Bore,"This book is such a bore. All the girls are so cliché. If they didn&#65533;t have different names, I&#65533;d think they were all the same girls,with just a few different personality traits. All the characters are soggy, the only thing I fount enjoyable was the plot. ..."
1,Really Boring,"I read the first 30 or 40 pages and cound not go on because it was so boring. Maybe it might have gotten better, but I do not think that was going to be the case. I do not recomand this book."
1,The Sisterhood of Utter Crap,"This is by far one the worst books I've ever read, it was a waste of about four hours of my life. The characterization is decent, but with the differences between them, it's hard to believe that they are friends in the first place. Also, the idea of magic pants being sent from person to person is just ludicrous. If I were you, and I had a second chance, I would avoid this book at all costs."
2,If it's the only thing on your shelf...,"In all honesty, this book is lame. If it's the only thing on your shelf and you have some extra time, go ahead and read it. You might find a smile or two in your. But really, it's unrealistic and a bit of a bore. It's just a very simple novel about cliche topics. What are the odds of one pair of pants fitting so many girls of different body types anyways?Maybe if I had read the book when I was 11 or 12, I would have liked it more."
2,"no, thanks","not my cup of tea.....they promised not to ever wash the pants! yuk!.....perhaps, they could've used something else, like a necklace, ring, or even a traveling journal."
5,Great Book,Definately read this. It is one of the most interesting and exciting books that I have ever read. I read this so quickly and I can't wait for the second one to come out.
5,One of the Best Books That I Have Ever Read,"After reading, ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"" overall I enjoyed it. It was easy to relate to all the four main characters in this novel, no matter how different they all were, personality wise or shape wise. tHis book was very vivid in describing things and wonderful all over all. It taught many valuble lessons about life and its many hardships through the plot as well as the inserted quotes from various places. Mostly females will want to read this book because of the overall plots and themes.In conclusion, this novel was one of the best that I have ever read and enjoyed."
5,Awesome book,This book is a great read for the teenage girl. Four very different girls... so while reading this i found myself compare myself and my best friends to these four amazing girls. No matter what kind of mood your in you'll wanna pick this book up and never put it down. It only took me two nights to read the whole thing!
4,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,This book was thrilling and entertaining. It was about four girls who were spending their first summer appart. But they still felt that they were together because they had a pair of pants that fit all of them perfectly.This captured the lives of most teenage girls today.I recoment this book to girls everywhere.
4,Fun and touching read,"Ann Brashares is a wonderful writer and captures the current teen girl subculture really well. Any reader will come to care about the characters she creates and what happens to them. Even though I haven't been a teenager for a while, I think this book is a great one to read about the power of friendship."
4,Great Book!,"This book is great! when I got it out from the library my mom said it sounded really weird by the title and I told her that my 13 year old aunt had read it and had thought the same thing and it turned out it was actually really good! I think any girl can relate to it. It was great cause it was funny,and sad at the same time. I think it's a great book for any girl 10 to 17. I can't wait to read the 2nd book, my 13 year old aunt has it out from the library right now!!"
5,My all time favorite book!!,"I LOVE THIS BOOK!! I have never read anything like this before. It is the perfect balance of everything anyone could ask for. The writing style is perfect for slow readers or fast readers.I started reading this book as I was walking through the book store and knew right away I would love it. It never gets dull and all of the characters are likable. As the story progresses you can feel the charachters growing up and learning more about themselves and those around them. All of the girls stories are sad, but the saddest would have to be Tibby's. She was possibly the most imature of all the girls, but by the end of the book she came out learning a lot. As the reader you find yourself begging to know what happens to all of the character's summers.Every girl thirteen and up should read this book, you won't be dissapointed!"
5,Awesome....Just Awesome,This book has a great drama theme to it. Sorta. It made me cry... because it's packed full of emoitions each girl is feeling. The book has awesome quotes too that relate to each new chapter. Very interesting an intriguing to read. I highly reccomend it.
5,A GREAT BOOK!,"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is such a great book! When Tibby, Bridget, Lana, and Carmen are spending they're first summer apart they agree to use the Pants, as a Sisterhood. Tibby is staying home, working at a local store, and she befriends Bailey. A girl with luekimia, she uses the pants to help Bailey. Bridget is away at Soccer Camp. When she is there she meets Eric, a really hot coach. She uses the pants to get his attention. Lana is traveling to Greece with her younger sister to visit their grandparents, Koskos, is her grandparents new best friend, and what do u know, he's Lana's age. Lana uses the pants to avoid him. Carmen is going to visit her father, when she gets there she finds he is engaged and she is going to have a step brother and a step sister. She uses the pants to make them not like her.Everyone's summer isn't going according to plan. What will happen when summer is over? Read the book to find out!"
5,No words to describe.,"If I could give this book more than 5 stars... I would have no trouble desiding to. I first heard about this book from my cousin and instantly shot it down, because the title sounded stupid. I then sat by a friend of mine on a school trip, and she was reading the third book of the series. She fell asleep and I snuck a glance at the page she was on. I started reading and I had to force myself to stop. When I purchased the original book it again had that effect on me and I reaad it in a day!"
4,Will Always Be Remembered And Loved Forever.,"I Can Not Say Enough Good Things About These Books. Every Girls In The World NEEDS To Read This ""Coming Of Age"" Story. These Books Are Truly Importent. Reading Them Will Teach You A Life Lesson. I Was 13 When I Read Them And I Learned ALOT From Them That Has Probably Helped Me With Growing Up. I Will Always Have A Special Place For These Books In My Heart And I Will Always Love Them, I Will Never Forget About It. Forever And Always."
4,I Wish I Could be the Fifth Member of Their Group!,I think this book is fantastic. I sincerely wish I would have had such a fantastic group of friends growing up. I really love that this book honors friendship and kindness amongst girls instead of showing girls in a negative light *cough gossip girl cough*
2,Superficial,"Are you an insecure teenage girl who wants to know what 'real' teens like to do? Do you think a pair of jeans can adequately symbolize your relationship with your friends? Congratulations, I know a fantastic book for you!Okay, so it's not that bad. It's not terribly written, but it's as horribly superficial and vapid as most teenage girls. So I suppose it's a success in that plenty of pre-teen girls will enjoy reading it because, let's face it, pre-teen girls generally aren't good judges of what's good reading material and what isn't.Anyway. My feelings in a nutshell: Silly premise, superficial, did not like."
5,An awesome story about Friendship!!,"A powerful first novel, Ann Brashares tells the story of 4 best friends and how their lives change over one summer. From Tibby, who thinks being stuck at home all alone is the end of the world, to Lena staying in Greece with her granparents, the girls come to know themselves and each other through the power of The Pants. It reveals to them their inner selves and how life can change in an instant. If you haven't read a good book in a while, then this is the one to read because you will thouroghly enjoy it."
2,it is hard to finish,"the only reason to read the first half is to find out if there is anything in the book besides girls with boys. along with many disappointing teenage stories, all the girls have to fall ""in love"" or something like it. a few parts are interesting, but for a non-romance novel lover, it was boring."
2,Too mature for young girls,"I have to say that I am a little amazed at the content that is presented here for young girls. The language was bothersome to me as was some of the content. I did enjoy the concept of the book and I like how the author was able to take you into the lives of these girls, I just felt that it could have been geared more to the targeted age group. As a parent I would recommend that you read this book before buying this for your daughters. I did not finish the book."
2,Review of The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"When 14 and 15 year olds Lena, Bridget, Carmen, and Tibby find a pair of pants that somehow looks great on all of them, even though they are different sizes, they decide to share the pants with each other over the summer. As Lena goes with her sister to visit her grandparents in Greece, Bridget goes to Soccer camp in California, Carmen goes to visit her Dad in South Carolina, and Tibby stays back at home over the summer, they all have special, sad, happy, and memorable things happen to them while wearing the pants."
3,A bit too cutesy,"I read this book on a rainy weekend expecting it to be fantastic. Unfortunately, it fell quite short of my expectations. The characters were boring and lacked real personality. Sure they each fit into a stereotypical teenage role, but they lacked spunk. Its a quick and entertaining enough read, good for the middle school aged girls out there. I recommend Sloppy Firsts and Second Helpings for the high school girls out there looking to really relate."
5,I love this book!,"This book is about friendship, and love. I really like this book. I like the characters, and I like all the things the group member does during summer. Some parts are funny and some parts are sad. When I finish this book, I 'm going to try the other 2 books about the Sisterhood. This book is great!"
3,Books Should Be RATED Like Movies,"I am a parent and teacher and although I enjoyed this book it is not appropriate in the young reader section. It was a bit sexually explicit for young readers, and the parents have no idea!"
4,An amazing book!!,"This is a great realistic fiction book. It is amazing what the four bestfriends do over one summer with these magical pants. Lena goes to Greece, Carmen goes to spend the summer with her dad, Bridget goes to soccer camp and Tibby stays home. All have amazing adventures that are fun to read. I couldn't put the book down!!!"
4,Magical,"I think that is book was an overall great book. It tells about a friendship that is tied between a pair of pants. The girls all seperate, but when each one of them gets the pants they feel like they have a piece of eachother. It shows a lot of love and friendship. I think that any young lady would enjoy reading this book!!"
4,Great book for young teens!!,"The paths that are taken by each of the four girls are great realities of life; love, death and divorce/remarriage. These are things that every teen has to deal with and the book gives a really good look into each one. Occassionally the timelines get crossed, and you have to figure out which girl the story is on, but I found myself (not an avid reader) drawn to finish reading the book. I read it every night for about a week. I then gave the book to a friend of mine who works with young teens and preteens. She is reading it now."
5,Anna's Review on an Amazing Book,"THE SISTERHOOD OH THE TRAVELING PANTS is an awesome and realistic novel that all teen girls can relate to. It is a story about how for best friends survive their first summer apart and how ""the magical"" pants unite them through it all.The book reveals what true love is and what true friends are. I loved this book. The characters seemed so real! I would recommend this book to all teenage girls. I am so excited about reading the sequel! I don't want to give away everything, but I do want you to treat yourself to this amazing novel!"
5,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"I am doing this book review on The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. It is by Ann Brashares. I would call this book Realistic-fiction. The setting changes throughout the book. There are four main characters, Tibby, Bridget, Lena, and Carmen. The book is based on the four best friends separating for the first time during the summer. They go through many changes, and meet new people. They make new friends also. They also stay close to each other, by sending the pants,that suspiciously fit them, to all different places. There are also rules about these pants.This book was one of my favorite books. It dealed with a lot of problems that I could go through everyday. I recommend any teenagers to read this excellent, exciting book."
5,Loved it!,"This was an awesome book! I could not put it down. I read the entire thing in a day it was so good. It was really cool how it went from one girl to another,and that added to the suspense because you had to read about the other girls before coming back to the original girl. Sometimes this was confusing, and I had to read a page more than once to understand, but overall this book rox, and the (...). If you read this one you have to read (...)"
4,Compelling,"""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" by Ann Brashares, shows four teenage girls who go through life changing experiences in one summer. Family divorces, dating boys, sexuality, death, friendship, and heritage are all the things Brashares describes through out the book. Each girl is different in everyway until they all try on a pair of pants and they magically fit all of their different shaped bodies perfectly. The pants play a big role in keeping the girls close during the summer when all of them would be apart for the first time in their lives. Brashares captures the human emotions and truth of being a teenage girl.This book is great for all ages of females, relating is one of the key factors which keeps' the reader hooked. The relationships the girls have brings the reader into the story and makes' them feel like they are apart of the book."
4,Sister Of The Awesome Pants,"I think the book was awesome. It was the best book about pants; I haven't heard any wrote about pants until about now. It was a long, funny, adventure, and great book I had ever read. The girls in the book were awesome people to read about. They were fur active girls in this book. Also every person has great or bad sides to him or her. Some people I know read the book and loved it. If I had a change to read a book it will be this one again.I'm going to read the second, and third one when I get a change. I think the book was very ,very awesome book."
3,A Whole New Meaning Of Sisterhood,"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was a confusing book.There's four teenage girls Carmen, Bridget, Tibby, and Lena. The summer coming up will be their first summer away from each other. They all find one way to keep in touch though. This way isn't any normal way they're not writing mail, or talking on the phone. They keep in touch by a pair of jeans which they call the traveling pants. They write where they were on the right pant leg, and their favorite thing that happened to them on the left pant leg. They made rules of what not to do while wearing the pants. If this book sounds like a book you would enjoy then read it."
5,Great Friendship story!,"Since it's summer now, why not relax and read this book? Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is a great friendship story, that circles around four friends, and a pair of magical pants, that helps them get through the summer together. I think this book is great to share with friends, and a great summer read. I guarentee you will love this book! Read it and see for yourself!"
1,It doesn't deserve even one star,The story lacks humor and plot not to mention positivly boring. I hated it. The characters seem unrealistic and a story about pants are boring. Ann Brashares should quit writing if she makes another story like this.
1,i dont think so,"I read the only first 1 or 2 pages because it was not right for me I think this book is for 4th or 5th graders. And I wanna know if the writer knows about the korea much more. I think she knows about the all koreans eat dogs only. Not ALL Koreans EAT dogs stupid.. The book says ""Korea, where people sometimes eat dogs.""I disrecommend this book never!!Don't waste your time with this book!!!"
5,An Excellent First Novel for Ann Brashares!,"Four best friends, Lina, Bridget, Carmen and Tibby are going to be spending their first summer ever away from each other. Friends before birth, the four girls had a special bond that would be hard to ever break, but how would they spend this summer away from each other?Carmen bought a pair of pants at a thrift store. Not an expensive, trendy pair of pants, but an ordinary, old pair of jeans. When the four friends found the pants to be magical, they each embark on their own summers, with the pair of pants traveling between them all. Between trying to be snuck on a soccer field in Baja California, making a new friend in the drug store, wearing them to a wedding and finding love in Greece, these pants truly helped the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants have one of the best summers of their lives.This is an excellent book, and I highly reccomend it to any reader."
5,Oh yeah! This book rox!,"I loved this book! You should definately read it. Well, if you're a boy then you might not like it, but I don't know. I loved it! Please, don't listen to those stupid reviews where people say 'Big Whoop' or 'it stunk like old cheese'. It really is good! I promise!"
4,"First loves & real lives; sweetly, lyrically retold...","This audiobook was utterly captivating! Goethals steals the show here, turning in an amazingly mature range of stunning performances: young women, old men, and everything in between, on a whirlwind tour of Greece, Baja California, and many destinations in between.Brashares' original story doesn't hurt things either -- it captures just the right mix of teenage angst and real-world bittersweetness. And the sheer magic of the pants! This would make a great gift for any teen on your list, or just for yourself.I wish this book had been around when I was a teenager, but being a grown-up now has its privileges: I can listen to this audiobook again and again while driving...and I don't need to ask permission to use the car!"
5,good read,"I loved these books, they were good. I saw the movies so wanted to read the books, was glad I bought these. I also bought the last book which goes forward when they're turning 30."
4,awesome,"Great read, easy to follow and makes you want to read the rest of the series. I recommend this book to all ages."
4,Good but not what I expected,I got the books that I wanted but they were not in the box set form it said they would come in. Instead I got the books all in hardback
1,Imitation just a form of flattery?,"Am I the only one who has noticed Brashares has borrowed liberally from Ray Bradbury's ""The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit""? I haven't seen him credited as having been her inspiration for Sisterhood, which is really a retelling of Bradbury's excellent short story. It just seems a sort of intellectual-property theft not to acknowledge that she took the primary story line from him."
4,Where can I get a pair?,"Ann Brashares's Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is a great book about the strength of friendship. Four friends, Carmen, Bridget, Tibby and Lena are spending their first summer apart and on the eve of their separation they discover a pair of magic pants. These pants fit each girl perfectly and become a link to keep the girls close even as they are hundreds of miles apart. As the girls run into problems, big and small, the pants are a source of strength to each in her time of need. With its positive themes and engrossing plot, I would recommend this book in a heartbeat."
5,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"The Sisterhood of the traveling pants was about a thrift shop pair of pants that magicly fits everyone. Carmen,Briget, Tibby and Lena are separating for the summer and decide to send the pants back to eachother to keep in touch. Briget is going to a soccer camp for the summer. Carmen is going to stay with her dad for the summer. Tibby is staying home. Lena is going to live in Greece with her grandparents for the summer. They all deal with different situations and have to overcome them. I rate this book 5 stars!! It was amazing. If your into a story about friendship this book is definitly for you!!!"
5,This is my new fave book!I am SO reading the sequel!,"This story is about 4 girls:Tibby,Bridget,Lena and Carmen.Carmen,Lena and Bridget are going away for the summer,so they spend their last day in town together.They find a pair of perfect pants and they create the Sisterhood.From then on, all of them share the pants in the mail and tell& face their problems in love,fam,friends and dead pets.But most of all,they help each other get thru their troubles and live.THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK.I AM READING THE SEQUEL.This book was written from the heart and Ms.Brashares has done well."
4,Two Thumbs Up!,"At first it was just a tad difficult for me to follow the adventures of each of the four girls in this cool book, hence the four stars instead of five. The point of view shifts a little too quickly in the beginning, but you'll more than likely get used to it. If you are looking for one of those novels that digs deep into the heart and soul of its main character(s), then ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" isn't for you.But if you are looking for a fun read that celebrates friendship and the things females go through as teenage girls, then you've picked up the right book!It was quite exciting to follow the girls on their separate adventures. It was like having four distinct stories all rolled into this one quick read. It makes me look forward to reading Part Two already. :)"
5,Wonderfully Written,"The Sisterhood is a great story. You get wrapped up in it and can't put it down. I find most books like this cheesy, but this one was so great, that I believe all girls aged 10-25 should read it. It's a great story of friendship and love, and I just fell in love with it. My favorite part was when Lena told Kostos... that made me cry. Everything about this book is great, and it should a) have a sequal written and b) be made into a movie. Keep up the good work Anne!"
5,Fantastic and I don't usually gush over a book!,"A very touching/moving story without being overly dramatic and ""I can't believe all this happened to these few kids"". Life really does throw you a loop and always when your expectations are 360 degrees from what 'does' actually happen. I highly recommend this book for any teen, boy or girl. I should know, I'm a young adult library assistant!"
5,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,"Lena is basking in Greece, Carmen is surviving in South Carolina, Tibby is stuck at home, and Bridget is having a ball in Mexico. Four best friends who have never been separated are trying to survive their first summer without each other. They believe they are doomed until they discover a pair of magic pants. A pair of pants that magically fit them all. The pants will take a journey with the girls as they separate. Will the pants bring the love, hope, courage, and understanding they desperately need?Ann Brashares writes books that are deep and rich in feeling. This book is the first out of two other sequels. With your eyes glued to the words on the pages, they seem to turn themselves. I highly recommend The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants to all girls who believe in magic.(...)"
4,Read it and you will enjoy it.,"This is a very good book, but I think is more for girls than for guys. It really shows us how friends should be like with each other. This book has a lot of ideas how we should be with our friends. This book is about Girls that been friends for a long time and never pass a summer with out each other until now. This book also shows how these girls have only one heart and how they care for each other. I really enjoyed reading this book and I also can relate this to my life."
5,Sure To Be A Series Worth Following...,"In the five long hours it took me to read it, my nose-- and my heart-- never strayed from this book's pages. Tibby, Carmen, Bridget, and Lena are characters vivid and real, and their first summer apart is filled with drama, excitment, and personal discovery as the sisters encounter the pain of loss, unpredicatable change, and budding romance. A pair of secondhand jeans links the four friend's stories, keeping them together when almost nothing else could.A refreshing break from the usual cruel clics so often depicted in books about teenage friendship, ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" is a terrific read. While you travel with the pants, catching glimpses of the lives of each ""sister"" in turn, the plot never sways from its underlying theme: this is a heart-warming, heart-wrenching, heart-breaking tale of true love and friendship."
4,This was a good book!,"Overall, I thought The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was a great book to teach children that no matter if you have friends or don't have friends, you must always have a positive attitude and that is what will reward you with a good outcome.This book was very descriptive and it gives you a good perspective of how challenging life may be without your friends. I think people who enjoy having their friends around and spending time with them and are sad when their friends aren't there should read this book.Each character has a special trait that they might or might not like, just like me. To me Lena was a good character in the book because she knew of some traits that she liked and didn't like. She is also a very kind person and I think that is a great trait to have.I think every girl in that book has realized that life isn't so bad without your friends and that someone is always there who cares."
5,A Great book you Won't want to Put Down!!,I loved the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants and its sequel. It was so easy to get into the book and I seriously had trouble putting it down! It also inspired my friends and I to start our own sort of sisterhood...it's great! A serious must read!
5,Great book about friendship,I LOVED THIS BOOK!! January 2002I had a hard time putting it down. I just couldn't wait to see what life-changing events would take place in each of the girls' lives over the course of the summer. I didn't want the summer to end! I loved the way that I could visualize everything that was happening.I can't wait to buy this book so that I can read it over and over again. It is a book with a lot of heart. I like that.Go to your library or bookstore and get this book. You will be glad you did.
5,A Nice Story About High School Girls,"This book made me laugh and cry. It's about 4 girls in the summer before their junior year in high school. They are all apart for the summer and use the pants as a way to stay in touch, kind of like a symbol of their friendship. If you remember having 4 best friends and all the times you shared or if you currently are in high school and can relate to this, you will love this book. It didn't turn out the way that I foresaw and was very entertaining. It only took me 2 days to read it. This would be a great gift for a girl 12-16 years old who likes to read. Or maybe one of your best friends from high school that you want to get something for so that she can ""remember when""."
5,A Surprising and Beautiful Read,"When I bought this book, I wasn't looking for great literature. As a sixteen-year-old bookaholic, this looked like just the thing to brighten up a dismal school week: fun and fluffy. Well, fun it was, but this was anything but fluff. The stories of each of the girls are moving and well-written. I found myself engrossed in Brashare's simple prose and really caring what happened to each of the characters. The first couple of chapters didn't really reflect the whole book, so if you start it and dont' like it, don't give up. This book moved me profoundly and brought tears to my eyes at several points. All of the emotions before me on the page were ones that I could relate to. If you're a teenage to HAVE to read this. If you're not, I would still recommend because it is an amazing novel that rivals the best of literary fiction."
4,traveling pants,I first bought this book for my younger sister as a gift. She read it and told me it was one of the best books she had read in a while and that I should read it too. When I read it I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it and went out to buy a copy of it for myself.
3,This book is worth reading !!,"This book taught me how friends can stick together even if its a distant relationship. In fact their relationship cycles between being close and distant, which adds alot of additional complications. It shows how these issues can be overcome even when there are four involved. I highly recommend this book."
5,Great!!,"This is (in my opinion) one of the best books I have read! It is about 4 girls who spend their summer in different places and discover a magical pair of pants that fits to the uniqueness of each of their bodies. Each girl gets the pants for a amount of time and then passes them on to one of the other four girls. This book is full of laughter, boys, teen struggles, jobs, death, friendship, and all the pleasures of being a girl!"
4,Life altering,"""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" uses a unique item, a pair of blue jeans, to keep a group of four friends together for the summer even though they are physically separated. They believe that the jeans are magical as they ""travel"" across the world and each girl also believes that the jeans bring them luck and help them to do things that they never thought possible.My favorite character is Libby. She is a rebel and likes to do things her way. When she is left at home while all her friends are traveling, she decides to make a video. While she is making the video, she meets and begrudgingly befriends Bailey, a 13-year-old girl with leukemia. Bailey teaches Libby about life and to take chances because you never know when life will be taken from you. Through all of this, Libby grows up, takes control of her life, becomes stronger and more content with who she is."
4,Sister Hood of the Traveling Pants,"""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"", is an outstanding book for all ages. This story is about four teenage girls who have been inseperable since they were born and now they have to split up for the summer and find their own adventures. Carmen is going to South Carolina where she will spend the summer with her dad, but what she doesn't know is what will await her arrival. Bridget is the boy crazy one, who is going to soccer camp. Will this be the summer she finds true love? Lena, is going to Greece to visit her grandparents. Lena is very coservative, but will the glorious trip away get her to release her inner beauty. Tibby is the only one staying home. She is making a documentry while working at Wallmans, the convenient store. Tibby makes a new friend and discovers something that is real and moving. An old pair of jeans is the only thing that will keep the girls together. How will the pants give the girls hope and love to have their best summer ever!"
4,sisterhood of the traveling pants,"I thought The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants was a great book. I highly recomend this book for teenage girls. You feel as if you know the girls, in the book the characters personality's range from sporty to flirty and you can relate to their lives.Personally I could relate all of my friends to characters from the book, making the book seem realistic.If you enjoy reading books written as diaries, such as Angus, Thongs, And Full Frontal Snogging orThe Princess Diaries I would highly suggest you reading this book.It isn't the average diary though it's the thoughts and feeling of all of these different girls.You also read letters back and forth between the girls. This book, I think, is a book any teenage girl would love ou go through love, heartbreak, and a tightly knit friendship of these four girls"
5,The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is GREAT!,The ages for this book probably start around age 11-12.Although this book would probably be interesting to teens through high school. The reading level is not very high so It wouldn't be a good choice for a challenge. Although this book is an excellent summer read. It's mainly about 4 girls who find a pair of jeans that fit all of them. During the summer each of the girls go somewhere else other than home. They use these jeans as a tool to keep them feeling as if they are together all summer instead of apart. This book tells the happenings during the summer and how these pants help each of the girls along the journey of life.
4,Wishing for Magic Pants too,"Yes, I picked up this book when I heard about the movie, so what. I usually don't pay much attention to books on the bestseller list because they can be somewhat disappointing, but not this one. It made me wish for my three friends and I from high school to be as close as we were then, but as adults we tend to let careers, marriage, and children over take the simple pleasures of what a good friendship can bring. So I learned a valuable lesson from reading this book about the teenage point of view. I have since made contact with these close friends and to my astonishment it has been successful, no magic pants needed but it would be nice."
5,Awesome book!,"This book was terrific, I read it in 2 days and immediatly looked for the second book. It follows 4 friends during their first summer apart. The characterization was very good, the girls had enough flaws and troubles to seem real, but were also great people that you could relate to at the same time. I loved the book! If you are a teen girl, this is a must read!"
