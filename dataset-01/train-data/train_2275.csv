4,highly recommended,"It doesn't matter if you dance ""on the 1"" or ""on the 2"", you'll find this dvd helpful. My wife and I have been taking lessons for about 6-7 months now and we were looking to enhance our progress. The moves are very nice, clearly explained, and easily adapted to your own personal style."
5,"Old Dog,New Tricks","As a middle aged man with little previous dancing experience,I have been finding my lessons tough going. I have difficulty leaning sufficient numbers of moves to get me confidently through a dance on a real dance floor. This video changed all that.The 3 patterns together with plenty of basics and a few add ons from my many lessons now allow me to dance confidently with my partner and other women of a similar standard to myself.The video is enjoyable to watch and learn from and is put together with professionalism by a man who is clearly the master of his art. It has allowed me to make a quantum leap and I look forward with relish to Volume 2."
3,Salsa DVD,"very first purchase on amazon in early 2005.i've watched it, but surely didn't learn much atleast for v1."
2,Very Little Content.,"Although this DVD was useful for it's sidenotes, such as foot positioning, posture, etc. It did not contain much in terms of actual steps. I think that this DVD would be good for someone who has never been to a salsa club before, but maybe I should have skipped to a more advanced version. I also bought ""The Quick & Dirty Guide to Salsa, Vol I"" I am very pleased with it, and I am ordering Volume II today."
4,Quality Ball Joint Fastener,"After using a die to clean up the threads on the ball joint end, this particular Hex Nut was an easy install."
4,Didn't receive what was described...,"I don't know if I'm not using my setter correctly or if I'm utilizing all the tips the right way, but the product description says that you will receive 4 tips to set eyelets and 3 to punch holes. This is not what I received in my case and was slightly disappointed. I recvd 3 tips to punch holes and 3 embossing tips that I still haven't figured out how to use! The setter came with a screwdriver like tip on the end that I can't figure out how to use either. Granted I'm still new at using this tool, so if I'm doing something incorrectly, please feel free to let me know! I opted to purchase this tool versus the older, hammer like one that everyone is still using and I hope I didn't make a bad choice."
5,My wife loves it,"My wife's only complaint was it was much mouser to use than she thought it would be, but she would definitely buy it again."
3,"Nice idea, needs more power and stability","Plastic ends of hole punchers don't punch through 100# stock without three or four punches even at the strongest setting. Probably fine for lighter weight. ""Trigger"" gets out of alignment now and then and requires unscrewing the top and adjusting the works a bit, kind of like the innards of a ballpoint pen. If I had it to do over, I'd probably go with an old-fashioned hammer piece with a separate rivet setter, but I suppose if you like having the different sizes and don't use it over and over (as I do for a project that requires thousands of holes and rivets), it's a handy and inexpensive option."
5,Loved It!!,"The description for this pendant is spot on! No smaller or larger and it has the nicest chain amongst the other key pendants I've seen around Amazon. The seller was prompt on responding to my inquiries and the shipping was unexpectedly fast! I had bought the necklace as a birthday present for my sister because she likes this kind of antique key style, plus the name of the pendant is really interesting as well. Long story short, she loved the necklace and I'm happy with the purchase :]"
5,Credit should also go to www.tvshowsondvd.com!,"A fantastic book about the fastest growing area of DVD releases at the moment, TV series! With breakdowns of cast and guides to the best episodes and releases I only hope enough credit goes to the website [...] who helped TV Guide put this book together!"
4,A good off-line reference to keep near the TV,"This book isn't perfect (I'd rather have more pictures of DVD set covers than old TV Guide covers, for instance, and the descriptions are a bit dry in places), but it IS cool to have a handy-dandy reference like this to use when you can't get online to look up the info. Good to take to the store or keep next to the TV. And if you read the fine print, you'll see that this book was made with the help of data from TVshowsonDVD.com, which is the best place I've seen online for that sort of info. Cool 'dat, and maybe for the next edition of the book TV Guide will work more with that website's staff to talk more about what's new, what's not out (any hints as to why), and what's expected to come soon. You know, show more of the TV-DVD enthusiast in this book...there's a lot of us out here!"
4,My Lion Belt Buckle,My belt buckle arrived in short order and in excellent condition. It just needed a little polish :-)
1,"Hemeopathy is garbage, and hence so is this product","Good grief. What you are buying here is very expensive water. Homeopathy is the idiotic belief that to cure a disease you should take something that causes the disease's symptoms (but hey, it sounds better when you dress it up in Latin: similia similibus curantur. Oooh...). But wait! It's OK, because it's diluted so much that there's nothing left of the thing that causes the symptoms. Those who push homeopathy claim that the water remembers having had the stuff in it... but then tap water has had everything in it, so if homeopathy is true, tap water should be a homeopathic cure for everything, and you can save your money.Seriously, don't waste your time or money on this."
1,quackery,"It is well known among scientists that homeopathic ""remedies"" have no beneficial effect other than a placebo effect. They can't. They are essentially pure water with a ""memory"" of a substance that has long disappeared through extensive dilution. The ""law of similars"", etc., is centuries-old superstition. It is amazing to me that the stuff is still sold. I suppose that if people want to spend their cash on a placebo it is their business. It may be a psychological benefit even if it has no curative value. It makes me angry, though, when this quack starts advertising his snake oil as a remedy for arthritis in dogs (as seen on TV). Just spray a little bit in their water every day. Sure. The problem I have with this is that the subject dogs have no knowledge of this. They have no hope for a cure, so they cannot benefit from a placebo effect."
1,Use Caution!,"First, the product did nothing for me. Of course that doesn't mean that it won't work for you. My complaint however, involves their very deceptive marketing practices. When you order on line they automatically send each month a new supply and charge your account as if you will be taking there product forever. In addition before checking out you are presented with the opportunity to get an extra bottle for what appears to be half price, when you get the bottle you find that is actually half the size. I would use extreme caution before giving these snake oil salesmen my credit info."
1,did not work for me,"Used it to the last drop, but I didn't fell any improvement. Not a bitNada. false claim? maybe."
1,Perucki's Review on Dr Frank's Pain Relief Oral Spray,I didn't see any relief. I admit that I didn't use it as strict as the directions indicated but spraying four to six sprays each dose six times a day to start seems a bit much.
1,Beware of automatic shipments and unauthorized CC charges!,"We Ordered this for our cat and paid extra for express shipping. It came in 10 days. They refused to refund the extra for shipping. In the meantime, we lost our cat and come to find out they billed our credit card for another shipment that we did not order. About 10 days later we got the second bottle. When we called customer service, they refused to refund our money and said it had been too long. We received it yesterday and did not order it in the first place. No idea if this product works, but please beware of giving them your credit card!!Bad business practices."
1,Don't buy anything from Dr. Frank,"First off, the product doesn't work as advertised. (I tried both joint & muscle sprays for myself and my dog). Absolutely NOTHING changed after using this product for 2 months. Then they keep sending more and more product with no way to contact this SHADY company. I'm embarassed that this type of company can still exist this day in age. I'm embarassed I bought into the hype in the first place. I'm trying to save you the same headache and embarassment. I actually had to cancel my credit card so they would stop sending me this worthless snake oil. This company is a pathetic money grubbing organization with nothing of value to sell. Be warned."
1,A Sucker is born every day!,"You would be wise to do a search on google (""dr franks joint pain"") where a young intern has an interesting article and study on this product. If it's too good to be true, it must not be true. This is just ""snake oil"""
1,"More Voodoo ""Cures""","Why purchase or even try any homeopathic ""remedy""?? Homeopathy is pure flimflam and no one should waste his or her money on it."
1,Dr. Frank's money making scheme,I bought this because I have Fibromyalgia and used it faithfully. It did nothing - absolutely nothing. Please beware before you buy this that they make it very difficult to return also.
2,HELP!!!,"HELP!!! First I was supposed to get 2 for $26.00 and some cents. I paid $30.00 for each one. I used one a while and did not see any change or inprovement. One is still in the box. Bought in June. they have been hanging around for what seems forever. I would like to return them and get my $60.00 back. Of course, without the S/H fees. How do I go about getting ahold of a human that can HELP me? g.huston"
2,THIS PRODUCT DID NOTHING FOR ME,Dr. Frank's Joint & Muscle Pain Relief Oral Spray did not help me with my pain. I will not reorder this product again. As I have stated it did nothing for me.
1,Phony as a $3 bill and nasty,"I purchased this liquid for my wife who suffers terribly with pain as described - not only did this con artist get money for the first order they kept shipping the product and billing. Stopped them after 3 orders to cease, wish there was some way to tell others about this phony product or stop them from advertising. Besides that my multiple contacts with their 'customer service' was with the most nasty humans I have ever spoken to' Isn't there some protection for consumers?"
1,"Sleazy company, ineffective product.","The ordering process was frustrating, with upcharges accumulating, even though I did not click on them. There was a lot of misrepresentation and deception on the ordering and the charges.The product was also ineffective. Getting them to refund my money per their money back guaranty was an exercise in frustration. Even though I canceled the automatic monthly shipments, they kept charging my card, without shipping anything.I finally ended up having the credit card company take it off my bill and accept no future charges from them.On careful reading, the 5 star reviews here seem fake."
3,this takes the edge off the pain,"They are slow in shipping, and I would not buy directly from the company because I have heard of complaints. The product does work for us, three or four sprays under the tongue, when in pain. The bottle last us 6 months"
4,A great way to kill time on a road trip,"These CD's are hilarious!!! Though most of the jokes are suitable for children, be aware that there are some that are risque and many that are just plain over their heads. Also many of the political jokes are dated. You'll find yourself thinking, now who was John Kerry again? But aside from these minor drawbacks, it's a great way to while away the hours on a road trip. Don't want to buy it? See if your public library has it in its collection. Mine did."
5,Packed With Knowledge!,"Perhaps the highest praise for this refreshing little memoir is this: if certain other captains of industry had read Ken Iverson's book when it was published in 1998 and heeded its advice, investors would have been spared billions in losses and a slew of corporate scandals would have been averted. Iverson, head of steel maker Nucor Corporation, injects much-needed common sense into the often-bureaucratic, hierarchical world of corporate boardrooms and corner offices. This persuasive text, written in the sort of clear, muscular prose you'd expect from a steel man, will make you want to give up your executive parking space and embrace an egalitarian corporate structure. We recommend this engaging work to managers who want to look at their jobs a new way."
5,ideal management,"When I read most books written by CEOs, I feel like I am being conned. I know how most CEOs are, telling upbeat lies to their employees and then stabbing them in the back. But somehow I feel that Ken Iverson is really telling the truth and giving us ""plain talk"". This book describes ideal corporate management, ideal both for employees and for long-term shareholders."
2,Pink Fairies - 'Kill 'Em & Eat 'Em' (Demon) import CD,"'Kill 'Em & Eat 'Em' was the band's 1987 comeback effort. I was pretty let down by this CD. Even though drummer / vocalist Twink plays on this ten track disc, I just could simply NOT get into the groove at all. The only two tracks that even come close to grabbing my full attention are ""Waiting For The Ice Cream To Melt"" and ""Fool About You"". In my humble opinion,'Kill 'Em & Eat 'Em' is the Pink Fairies in name ONLY, but certain not spirit or style. Check out their more recent reunion CD's, like 'Pleasure Island' ('96) or 'No Picture' ('97). Now those two are well worth seeking down a copy."
3,the inititator of punk imitating their descent followers...,"so disappointing... the original punkies Pink Fairies are run out of creativity in their 70's and have to ""update"" their sounds by imitating their descent followers... punk with no content, simply loud loud and loud. Clash's albums are far better."
4,if you like fields of the nephilim...,"First the songs: Ageless, Rest a While, Doubt All, Insatiable, Cut Down, On Your Side, This Drenching Night, Bury My Gold, Empty Hands, Eat With Me.if you like fields of the nephilim, you probably will like Rubicon,taking into account this is the band of yates, wright, pettit and wright with vocalist andrew delany.the only reason to rate this with 4 stars is because ""what starts, ends"" (their previous cd) is perfect and unmatchable, and have what i consider the best indie, rock gothic song ever: ""Watch Without Pain""you could find this two works in beggars banquet web."
5,Way to go! Wonderful Debut!!,"I am always interested in keeping track of new vocalists in all genres of music, country being no exception! I am amazed at the emotional depth and control Tammy has in her voice! Every song is captivating and highly reccommend this cd to anyone! I have a feeling she will be around Nashville for years to come! EXCELLENT!"
1,"Cheap, thin, Made in China, glass","Don't waste your $$, or think this is a good deal even if they are free. The glass is the thinnest I've ever seen in wine glasses, even when compare to cheap grocery or big box store varieties. The glass is so cheap, it is doubtful they will last a week. Try something else. Not sure where the other reviewer comes up with 5 stars. I'd rate is a 0 if that were an option."
4,This lever does not break easily. No way!,"After reading some reviews about levers I was concerned about the sturdiness of them. Pedro's levers exceeded my expectations. One can't say they are unbreakable, but if used for it's intended purposes, these levers don't break easily. It's a great way to remove the tire from the rim without inflicting small damages to the aluminum rim caused by metal levers.However, the levers was not much of a help to put back the tire inside the rim."
5,Superb Story of Suffolk Downs,"""Suffok Downs"" by Christian Teja hits the perfect dynamic, intertwining the visual, historical, personal and statistical elements that make sporting so captivating. The photos and captions together tell you not only where the track itself has been and is going, but also where the lives that have touched it have been and are headed. This is true for the human and non-human alike, including the great horses of course, but even other characters ranging from the Beatles to Rin Tin Tin. In one of my favorite depictions, the photo shows the great finish in the 1987 MassCap and Teja adds the perfect spice by telling the reader that track announcer Jim Hannon's voice cracked in excitement at the conclusion of his call. Teja does a fantastic job making the photos come alive, drawing the reader eagerly into this great book."
1,GARBAGE!!!!,You pay a lot for a 12 minute interview on 60 minutes. They didn't have that in the description. I thought it was a new DVD standup. Stay away.. As a matter of fact I will sell you mine real cheap.
3,Not What was Expected,From reading the intro I did not expect a short 10-15 minute DVD with little or no stand up from Larry.
1,NOT AUTHORIZED by Larry The Cable Guy,"Warning to all shoppers thinking about purchasing this DVD: This is not an officially authorized product from Larry The Cable Guy or his management. All this DVD contains is the 15 minute or so feature story about Larry The Cable Guy that aired on CBS' 60 Minutes in December 2006. Again.... This is not new comedy material, Blue Collar video, or anything else that Larry The Cable Guy has authorized for sale or distribution. Do not buy it."
5,Stimulates the imagination!,"My four year old son is in love with this chapter series! A friend suggested it to us since he seemed ready for a more advanced reading material at bedtime. My husband reads him a chapter every night...sometimes more because they don't want to stop. It's become a great tradition for them, and something they both look forward to. We love that there are so many in the collection! Start with number 1 and just continue. :)"
3,The Amazng Kids from the magic tree house,This book is about two kids named Jack and Annie. One day a magic tree house sends them back to the Roman times to the Roman Empire. When they got there they feel a tremble. After that they knew there was a Volcano. They fought and saved the Roman Times.I gave this book three stars because it shows Annie and Jack were determined. And it was easy to understand. I recommed it because it is a nice story and there is a good message.
5,Great Toy,"Dear all people who are interested in this book.You'll love ALL the Magic Tree House Books.Especially, this one.This is a great book about volcanos. It is a very fun book.You will love it."
4,this book is nice,this book is nice because the volcano was erupted out of the volcano.and all the people went away from the volcano.

4,Back Cover of M&B ISBN 0-263-74835-9 - (A Keeper),"Cathy had reason to be grateful to Fabian Blackthorne when he got her out of a nasty spot of trouble, brought about by her own foolishness. But then tragedy struck Fabian when he was blinded in an accident - and the tables were turned with a vengence as it became apparent that Cathy was the one person who could help him. And, inevitably, as they were forced into closeness Cathy found herself falling more and more in love with him. But what consolation was there in the situation when she knew that, in any other circumstances, Fabian would only want the glamorous Cerise Hunniford?"
2,High Price,Please beware these stock pots are very small. You might want to look at something else if you want a bigger stock pot
5,The Everlys Trlumphant Return,"After 10 years apart from each other, Don and Phil got back together in 1983 on stage at the Royal Albert Hall in London. They and their band (with Albert Lee on guitar). The Everlys and the band all sound great. The video and audio production here is excellent. One of my very favorite live concert DVDs."
1,Everrly Brothers reunion Concert DVD,"The 1st time I played the new DVD, it stopped working during the second song and froze up. I cleaned it, cleaned my DVD player - to no avail. Even tried playing it on other devices with no luck. Very disappointing, especially with all the success I've had with Amazon products over the years."
3,I wish it had gone a bit further,"The legendary Albert Hall concert is something that most fans are familiar with by now. I bought this particular DVD hoping that the documentary ""Rock and Roll Odyssey"" would also be included in its entirety. It is not; in fact, at least a half-hour of footage (if not more) is missing.The concert is wonderful; I just wish the ""bonus"" was as great as it could have been if left intact."
4,Good But Missing Something,"This latest collection of Millennium City's greatest hero may be fun but it is missing something that the previous collections had. Each of the five issues collected within contain only a single story each. While the stories do manage to be fine adventure comics on their own, they do not have the cleverness of the earlier stories. It may be because the name Alan Moore is missing from the cover. But whatever the reason, while it is good reading, it could be about any hero and comic world.In this volume, Tom Strong must discover what is behind the sudden failure of flight. Then imaginary dimensions begin to plague the city. In the third Issue Pneuman must reconcile his role with a promise made long ago. Next Tom tackles an old foe's partner. Finally Tom must face the dull reality that is his real life. In the end the reader has been entertained but not to the degree as with the earlier adventures. I hope that this will not be a continuing trend with the series."
1,Cheap junk,I bought this to fill my air tank so I did not have to hold the chuck. This piece of junk is no good. They need a lot more R&D before putting this kind o stuff on the maket.
1,Terrible - Won't lock on short stems - have to push on by hand,"I love ""Slime"" for fixing tires, it works great and the tire guys never mind properly repairing a tire even when I use this. (They won't touch a ""Fix a Flat"" tire.However this air chuck is terrible. It will not go on enough on shorter stem to lock on, I am constantly forced to hold it on tightly which negates the function of a lock on. When doing trailer tires and questionable car tires having you head next to them is not my idea of fun. This was supposed to be a solution and allow me to fill the tire from 6 or so feet away. However this product is terrible for most uses. On stems that are long enough for it to work right it is okay but more often than not especially for car tires it is horrible. Shame on ""Slime"" for selling such a poor product."
3,So far so good,"That's ok, but it's too big and so flotable. I think that sony could made a best product than this"
4,Boxset has all 20 episodes - don't panic,"While the DVD set lists 17 episodes, the ""missing"" three episodes are here under the ""More Sam"" bonus feature."
5,Applegate is an outstanding actress!,"It's a pity the show was canceled. Applegate is an outstanding and very talented actress. Whatever she does is awesome. Since the shows go on and off depending on the ratings, and in this case, the ratings went down due to a change of exhibition time which faced a harsh competition, the only thing that was left for us fans was the second season turned into a final one. I hope ABC would have a second thought on that, but they never do. So, let's wait for C. Applegate's next work."
5,Concise and clear,"This title is a very finely written history of the work of redemption from Genesis to Revelation.""The Progress of Redemption"" is clear and easy for the beginning student of Scripture to understand. Christ is the Messiah and is the fulfillment of Israel. This book is a modern ""classic"" on this topic.Only Holwerda's ""Jesus and Israel"" can compare with this book.I am in total agreement with the reviewer below...get this book, you will not be disappointed with the depth of study and scholarship."
4,An excellent choice for educational fiction,"I found this book many years ago. It is a collection of many stories by great authors (Steinbeck, Bradley and others),each offering an environmental message in short story form. I use this book as a tool teaching science to middle school students and they all love it, although, many of the stories are targeted toward more mature readers. I'm sure that you will enjoy this book if you are lucky enough to find a copy."
5,The best MxBx yet!!!!,"Anyone whose listened to Melt Banana before would know that they never dissapoint. Every one of their albums has been absolutley incredible, and every song is killer. This album is no exception. And in my opinion, the best one yet. Bambi's Dilemma has more of a rock and roll feel this time around, while still retaining those noise rock/grindcore tendencies. Yako's vocals are absolutely incredible, and Aagata(guitar) seems to be playing more actual riffs this time. All in all, if you like Melt Banana, you know what your getting. If this is your first Melt Banana cd, this is where you should start. And make sure you see them live, theres nothing like it."
3,Note:,Do not buy these woofers if you don't have adequate power. You'll be a sad customer if you do. If you listen to rap and R&B prominently I'd recommend Kicker 15s.
3,"Loud, but quality is lacking.","These subwoofers can definitely get loud.Their RMS rating is spot on, I wouldn't recommend exceeding 500w for daily usage.My main complaint about these is about their sound quality. Yes, they get pretty loud for the amount of power they handle, but they don't sound very good. They aren't the best subs for handling those low frequencies bass heads love. They shine in the 40hz + range, but they quickly fall off below that, even if your enclosure is tuned below that.If you want to get loud and you don't really care about low frequencies... These are a decent option.I used 2 of these for about a year. They were okay subs but I wouldn't buy them again."
5,Big bang for the buck.,"Replaced a failing P3, I was surprised this sub was half the price and so far sounds better. This sub is in the family car, so the bass levels are turned down. Haven't really pushed it yet, but so far I'm impressed. I actually bought 3 more for the other car."
1,bad flange,the wires that connect to the coil burns out easily really bad subs if ya want it to hit hard last for 3 month and went to crap.
1,bad,"I got the Speakers in, or if that what you want to call them. The box was torn all up, they were about 8 days late of when they said it would be here. One of the speakers was BROKE, it had a hole in the sub part. Dont but anything from this seller."
5,Works great,"Works well, sounds great....and has held up pretty good considering the choppy ride in my 3/4 ton truck"
4,Excellent quality..better than I anticipated!,"I have these in a bandpass box powered by a 1400 watt Sony amp. can't believe how loud it is! I had two Rockfords in the box before and it's not even a comparison. For the price, you can't go wrong."
5,they bang in my jeep great buy for the money,fast shipping. put 2 in a jeep grand cherokee and the bang my roof shakes like crazy and not even turn all the way up
3,The Middle School Mathematician: Empowering Syudents to Achieve Success in A;gebra & Geometry (Kids' Stuff),"This book looks very good. Summer Break just started, I plan to read this summer and use this coming school year. Sorry I can't give a more thorough review at this time!"
5,Laughter in Paradise,Will this title be available at Amazon very soon? I have seen it with some friends and it is very funny and good.
4,Well written homage,"Loved reading this had a hard time putting it down, Shay does a wonderful job bringing out the intensity. Just bought the other two!"
2,Not a Christian fiction,"I was not very pleased that this book was listed as a ""Christian"" fiction. I got about 4 pages into the book and had to remove it from my Kindle because of the offensive language. Amazon needs to do a better job at categorizing books. This was definitely not a Christian fiction."
3,Zach,"I truly enjoyed the book, the emotions were real, the language real and the long love scene between Gray and Jenn had me laughing. I loved the author's sense of humor by putting a time line in it! The Malvaso family felt very real with their differences, yet strong love for each other.I was left wondering about Zach and where his life is going now. I also wanted to understand Casey Brennan better. Perhaps in another book?"
4,A firefighters story,"This was a very good book. I didn't want to put it down. The characters seemed real, the story seemed realistic. It was obvious the author did a lot of research. I think firefighters would enjoy the story.I found the sex scenes a little explicit but I admit I am a bit of a prude. Without the expletives and the sex scenes I would recommend the book to everyone. But given the above mentioned I won't recommend it and I won't be able to read the sequels."
2,not as good as it looks,"I found some of this book pretty good. I was put off, though, by the long drawn out sex scenes (to be fair, they weren't many,) the unnecessarily foul language, and the sense of ground already covered. And covered. And covered. I'd say the book would have been greatly benefitted, earning a 4, or perhaps even a 5, rating, had probably one quarter to one third of the book mercifully fallen to a more astute red pencil. Hint to author: ""Edit, edit, edit!"""
2,Title should have been Firefighters and Sex,"This free kindle book was recommended to me so i added it and read it. I enjoyed the details on firefighting and it really had the potential to be a good story. Too bad i ended up skipping over pages and pages of long and drawn out sex scenes that were not necessary. I admittedly to not like harlequin type romance stories becasue they are so predictable, boring, and filled with nonsense. This book is on the fringe of that genre and I really hated that about it."
1,didn't like,I didn't get past 2 pages because of the foul language. I don't understand how this adds to a story.
5,kickbox with Patricia Moreno,I've been kickboxing off and on for years. I had read the reviews and was hesitant about ordering the kickboxing with Patricia Moreno but I will tell you she's the absolute best! I had been doing Billy Blanks for years and while he's quite fast and good I found this one to be well cued and effective. I didn't expect to be sore but first time I was sore for 2 days. She is repetitive which makes this so effective because you spend a lot of time concentrating on the move and not how fast it can be executed. Thumbs up all the way!
2,This One's Going Back,"I'm not entirely certain what type of person the intended target for this DVD was, but it certainly is not me. It doesn't really cut it as a cardio work out, as most of the segments are too slow with too much down time in between each series of combinations while the instructor demonstrates what you will be doing. It doesn't really cut it as a toning workout, either, as there really is not much in the way of resistance. It won't work as a beginner's workout, because many of the moves/combinations are too difficult (and possibly dangerous) to be done by someone who has never worked out before. The only segment that I found enjoyable and worthwhile as a cardio workout only lasted ten minutes before she started cooling down."
3,definitely a challenge,"It seems as though most people give the highest ratings to workout videos to the ones that make you feel like you might die when you finish it. I like a challenge as much as the next person, but if you're like me and you basically hate to exercise in the first place and you're looking for a fun workout that you'll look forward to doing on a regular basis, I can't recommend this video for you. Just trying to perfect the correct form is a challenge and if you're the least bit uncoordinated you're going to have to rewind a couple of times. It is good for beginners because most of the tape is concern with teaching you the basic moves. Once she puts them all together, the combination workout isn't that hard. It certainly motivates you to become a better kickboxer, but it rates low on the fun meter."
2,Shut-Up!,"I enjoyed the DVD as soon as I turned the volume down and put on my own music.Yes, I got sweaty and burned calories, yadda-yadda...But the incessent pycho-babble from Patricia Moreno is exactly why I DON'T go to fitness classes and like to work-out at home. The most irratating part, is that you don't have to listen to her telling you to give a 100% once, but over and over again throughout the DVD. And then each time you watch it too. She just seemed way to full of herself. I mean the workout gets you sweaty, but it's not that hard. I have an extensive fitness and dance background, so being talked to like I don't know how to punch eight times in a row is unsettling.I love doing workout DVD's. If I had know she was going to spout all the inspirational annoyances throught this one, I would not have purchased it.However, if you have an IQ over 10, you can do like I did, turn down the volume and put some groovy tunes on and avoid watching her flapping lips!!!"
2,Didn't break a sweat,"Definitely a good beginner workout, but not for the intermediate to advanced. Not challenging, didn't get my heart rate up, too low intesity for me."
4,Great workout,"This is certainly a tough workout. I do intense cross training six days a week and have been doing kickboxing for about two years now. I've certainly survived more difficult classes but this still got me working up a sweat.Patricia is very good with audio cues and easing into the moves so you can learn the combinations. As other reviewers pointed out, there are a few drawbacks. It is strange that there isn't a ""play all"" button for the sections of the workout, but it's really not that big of a deal. And I also agree that she talks WAY too much, but to be honest, if you can just block some of it out, it's worth it to stick through it because this is a very good kickboxing DVD. Definitely recommend."
4,"love having the epidosdes, wish there were features","I love Boy Meets World. It's hilairious and the characters are developed well. I just wish the DVDs had special feautes. I know when they shot these DVDs weren't a big thing, especially for TV shows, so I understand not having any Behind the Scenes footage or outakes. But couldn't they have gotten some of the cast together to do some commentary? They did for season 1!Anyways, the show is wonderful. I love that I have the series on my shelf so I can go back to high school with Cory, Shaun, and Topanga any time I want."
5,Thank you Lionsgate!,I'm so stocked for the upcoming release of season 5! Thank you Lionsgate! Keep them coming!The only thing that would make this (and future BMW) release better is more special features.
3,Go to the Light,"This was actually a gift for my little sister, however I also enjoy this movie at times. It's a lil different. It seems to be in great condition."
5,"Great show, great Dvd",Dvd came quick and was in perfect condition. Even though this is the season where they are older it is good for kids... unlike most of the shows on TV today
5,Great show!,"This makes a great gift for anyone who grew up on this show. I'm not sure how many season there are, but this fifth season was what my bil needed to further complete his collection. Anyone who even watched this show a little bit must admit that Corey and Tappenga were cute, fun and great together. This series provides lots of laughs, wonderful drama and lessons learned. Can't wait to get my girls into this show!"
5,Really? It's Boy Meets World season 5,"Anyone in my age group grew up with Corey and Tapanga in their life. If you don't know about boy meets world, find out."
5,Holy bass Batman!,"This subwoofer hits incredibly hard. I have two, and I would say that they hit almost if not as hard as my friends Rockford Fosgate P3 12s that he runs at 1000 watts each, while my kickers are on only 500 watts! It hits hard enough to give you a back massage, and yet still has amazing tone quality. I will go for Kicker first from here on out. Great pound for those of us with smaller budgets."
5,Some sweet subs,"Got my subs, had them installed the next day and had them do a quick tune on the amp and receiver, turned the volume knob up and... Boom Da Da Boom Boom...They did not disappoint, the sealed enclosure still had my trunk rattling, very nice sound, I've had them in for a month and so far am pleased."
3,Loud until they crap out,"I had two 12s 2 ohm in a sealed box, with the kicker zx750.1 amp pushing them, and they were just as loud as the two 12"" type r's I have now. With that being said, I have always heard that these subs were super durable and that you could pound the snot out of them without them crapping out on you. But I managed to melt the tinsel leads on both of my subs =/ I took them back to where I bought them and the guy said I was playing them too loud and that playing them that loud for periods of 30+ was abusing them. And that would happen. So I got them replaced and sold them. Went with the MRP-M1000 alpine amp and 2 type R's and they sound much cleaner, more punch and just as loud if not louder than the comp vrs, and I blare them for 30 minutes+ all the time without any problems"
4,Old paperback,"It was a pleasure to be able to find an older, out-of-print book and have it sent promptly with no problems."
5,Nice suit,"Very nice suit. First class seams and straight stitching. No apparent bad work anywhere.Fabric looks heavier than it actually is.... (looks like wool) so feeling of it between ones fingers can be a little surprising. It's unexpectedly thin. But an advantage is that the claim that this is an All Weather Suit, is true. Should be wearable on a bright sunny day.... just fine.... whereas a true wool suit would not be.The Italian styling of this Business Suit is interesting, in that it retains its ""Power Suit"" aspect, while allotting it a measure of artistic flair, as it were. But not so much as to degrade its true ""business"" C.E.O. quality.I like it."
2,things i thought were wrong with this book,IT DIDNT GIVE ALL OF THE INFO I NEEDED. I DIDNT THINK IT EXPLANED THINGS I HAD TO KNOW SO I COULD GET PAST THE PART WHERE THE GERNADES WERE BE LAUNCHED AT THE TRUCK THAT I WAS SUPPOST TO PROTECTON THE FIFTH OR SIXTH LEVEL.
2,Tailored to YA readers,"Alta fails to live up to the promise of Joust. While Joust seems somewhat targeted to a young adult audience, it provides the groundwork for a good fantasy series that also appeals to adult readers. Alta has the potential to be intriguing, but falls short. The plot development bored me; it left me wondering whether the series will drag on over any number of books. Definitely simplistic, probably good for very young adult readers.The Valdemar trilogies that Mercedes Lackey initially produced had much better content--and riveted my attention--much more than some of her recent work."
3,What happened?,"I was really looking forward to this book and so it was a huge disappointment to find it not half as good as Joust. I had a hard time getting into the first half, maybe because I just didn't like the characters as much as I did in Joust. Also it seemed different somehow. Almost as if it was trying to be a Harry Potter book or something. I don't know. This reader was disappointed."
5,The Challenges of Freedom,"In this sequel to Joust, Vetch has escaped from his Tian Masters mounted on a young dragon that he secretly hatched and raised according to methods learned from his master Ari. He takes back the name his parents gave him, Kiron, son of Kiron and embarks on a new adventure in his homeland of Alta, which is vaguely reminiscent of Egypt under the Pharaohs. Almost at once the skills he has learned hunting with his dragon enable him to rescue a young noblewoman from a rampaging hippo.This is a superb story of a young man encountering the twin challenges of maturity and freedom. The perils that Kiron faces and overcomes are no longer solely for himself. Once again, Mercedes Lackey shows her skill as a master storyteller. Highly recommended."
4,Couldn't put the book down!,"I have to say I really enjoyed this book. I was genuinely interested in the life of Vetch- turned Kalan- i think that's what he changed it to. But any way, Mercedes Lackey did a good job on this one. Pick it up, you won't regret it."
3,"Light weight, but fun","This is the 2nd book in the triology and develops the characters a bit more and introduces more conflict and complications. It is a fast read, rather lightweight, but I enjoyed reading it. Recommend this series to young adults also."
2,Whew!,"I could not keep reading this. It just did not keep my interest. I got bored to death trying to read this. I honestly don't know what I was expecting in this title, maybe a little amusement. It just didn't happen. I got bored with it. Sorry!"
5,Amazing and true,"I have been doing only two practices, only pranayamas, nothing else. I am up to 5 minutes of Kapalbhati and 15-20 minutes of Anuloma-Viloma pranayama. After only about three weeks my arthritis symptoms are greatly diminished. This is truly amazing. Also I have tremendous energy and markedly increased libido."
3,PUDO HABER SIDO MEJOR,"Bohemia Suburbana tiene talento para hacer mejores cosas que esto, lo demostraron en mil palabras con sus dientes, sin embargo no es del todo malo, tiene canciones muy buenas de la calidad de los otros albumes como Escualo y Herir sin darse cuenta.El resto de las canciones, son simples canciones de soft rock, algunas mejores que otras, definitvamente no es un disco para escuchar todos los días pero si es bueno escucharlo de vez en cuando.Definitivamente el tiempo separados les hizo mal y no pudieron volver con la calidad que se esperaba.Ojalá vuelvan a hacer música y música mejor que esto porque sí tienen talento."
2,Just for the collection,"Well the album is just OK i was expecting alot more but I guess they do not sound the same since the band got new drum player, and I wonder what is going on to giovanni's voice because in this cd it sucks. I guess I will stick to their second album (mil palabras con sus dientes) as the best they ever made. This new album lacks of the bohemia that used to be now is like a new garage-band who doestn know what the hell they are doing but well buy the album just for your collection and dont expect the old bohemia because that is GONE ""a long long time ago"" and now you are ""face to face with"" a new band that sucks."
5,Very good!,Wanderful T-shirt!!! It's an original Marvel T-shirt... Thanks a lot.Wanderful T-shirt!!! It's an original Marvel T-shirt... Thanks a lot.
3,Nice Shirt,This shirt is pretty nice. It feels nice and like its good quality. I got my boyfriend a large which is the size he wears for his normal t shirts. it fits fine. the sleeves were a little long but the short was actually the right length. he usually has a problem with the length of t shirts because he has a long torso. so i can imagine why people might think its too big. works for him though!
2,Lecture format; math and physics references for audience,"The moonwalk image on the DVD cover is misleading since there is hardly any mention of that experience in this DVD. Also, the format was not what I expected. However, there was information in Dr Mitchell's lecture to connect-the-dots between science and ESP research in recent years--primarily methodology to support quantum basis for sensory/extra-sensory data processing. Promising work is going on.The lecture could have been presented in an audio version as effectively (with a card listing his talking points)."
2,WHAT IF..............,"Sounds like a fascinating book....but what if no one ever landed on the moon? Because if they did so many years ago, why have current space programmes never repeated this....and what about the radiation belt around the planet??"
2,It was nothing like I expected.,"The cover says spells, rituals and meditations for everyday. But I have yet to come accross any in this book."
5,Airstream,"I loved it. It was a perfect fit, and a great value. I bought two so I would have a spare, but the original lasted 20 years."
3,"good song Any Other Woman, bad Sony","I love the song Any Other Woman, but I always copy my CDs and use the copies so that the original is preserved from scratches and damage....I won't buy anything else from Sony."
3,Buddy's sophomore album croons but doesn't shine,"If you want a CD with an uptempo country vibe, stop reading and click the back button at the top of your screen. If you want a lovely album with classical slow country ballads that would be great for a lonely, rainy day, buy this album. Jewell's voice is soft and strong at the same time and he shows off his wonderful range. While it isn't going to be a record-breaker ""Times Like These"" is a very solid CD."
1,DON'T SUPPORT CONTENT PROTECTED,I don't support artists who support content protected cds. This is not in the true spirit of music and art. ENCRYPTED MUSIC TAKES AWAY OUR RIGHTS AS AMERICAN CITIZENS. STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS AND DON'T BUY THIS ARTISTS MUSIC!
4,It does its job,"The claw is a little cheap and only works light duty, but the sock assist works pretty good."
2,Chrome plate covers,"Chrome plate coves are of low quality. Look good far away,close up chrome looks lousy. You get what you pay for."
1,Junk!,"After a very short exposure to road salt, this frame begins to pit and corrode. If you live up north or near the ocean, forget it."
4,"Attractive, Lightweight, Sturdy","This classic, chrome-plated license plate frame is a handsome addition that will enhance the appearance of the front and/or rear of your vehicle and at a reasonable price. It is VERY easy to mount. It frames the license plate without blocking out any personalizations on the plate itself.If you don't like those dealer license plate frames (and I do NOT), you can quickly and easily add an attractive look to your vehicle at a good price. I have found Cruiser accessories to be good value products."
4,Chrome license plate frame,I put two of these frames on my Honda CRV and one on the front on my Chevy PU. I don't know how long they will last but the price was good and they dress up the vehicles without being flashy.
1,"Looks good, but doesnt last long","Looks great out of the box, but within weeks, the ""chrome"" starts pitting!I'm disappointing in the quality of this product.I love the look and design of it, I just wish it lasted a bit longer than a few weeks."
4,"Great product, but it won't fit my VW Rabbit","I bought this when I had a Honda Civic, and it looked great and matched the chrome accents on my car. It didn't rust, was nice and shiny and was super easy to screw into palce. I think it's a nice, snazzy license plate frame. I'm sad, though, that it was too thick to fit on my current vehicle, a 2008 VW Rabbit. The top of the frame is too wide/tall and hit the underside of the top of my rear bumper, so the holes would not line up properly. I gave this to a friend to put on her Jeep Rubicon. It looks great on her vehicle and adds a little subtle bling to the beef of her ride. I wish it would have worked out for my Rabbit. Oh well. I recommend it, but make sure it will fit your car's rear."
2,much a do about little,i found this book to be a struggle to read.It is painfully obvious that the authors have attempted to build a minor engagement into something just short of Bull Run and/orGettysburg. They try hard but in my opinion they do noy carry it off.
1,Why make it???,"This is certainly one of the worst albums from the great Wishbone Ash. ""Twin Barrels Burning"" is also ridiculous. So, if you wanna get into this band don't waste your time and money with the albums they did along the 80's (except the great ""Just Testing"" - one of their best efforts) and run to ""Argus"", ""Pilgrimage"" or ""Wishbone Ash""."
2,Bottom of the barrel.,"(1985) ""Raw To The Bone"", is really the worst album by Wishbone Ash. The cover almost says it all. New singer,bassist Irishman Mervyn Spence from Trapeze who replaced Trevor Bolder, Spence had a good voice, but the material was just weak. Hard rock at it's most juvenile, like ""Rocket In My Pocket"". Great song in ""Cell Of Fame"" and the thunderous ""It's Only Love"". They would get back their original line-up back in 1987's ""Nouveau Calls""."
5,Review of Water Color Techniques,Tony Couch is a wonderful teacher. I learned so much from this book about water color technique. Doing the exercises gave a real boost to my confidence.
3,not a book,"This so called book arrived promptly, but it is not a book. It is loose pages that cannot be pieced together. In order to use it, I have to lay the pages out on my table. Very odd."
3,Basic guide to watercolor painting technique,"Plenty of photos to illustrate basic watercolor techniques, needed supplies. Improving your watercolor paintings."
1,Watercolor Techniques,"I did not receive this book. It should have been here several weeks ago. It was paid for by gift card. I would love to rate this book, but I need to have it before a rating can be sent."
2,Complete Novels of Thomas Hardy (Collins Classics),"The product advertised by several booksellers as ""Complete Novels"" is actually a single paperback entitled ""Selected Novels of Thomas Hardy."" It is a blatant example of deceptive advertising, and should not be advertised by Amazon."
2,Strombeck's Alternatives,"This book should be titled "" Home-Prepared Dog Diets"".90% of the book was focused on dog diets.The limited amount of information for cat diets was, in my opinion, not substantial or helpful."
2,a contrary opinion,"This book might be fine if you have a dog or two. If you only have cats, as I do, there's not enough in it to justify the price. You have to wade thru many pages of material on dogs to find several sentences on cats.There are also only about four recipes for cat food -- very repetitive and all using clams."
3,"not bad, but i don't agree with the diets","this is a decent book if you are wanting to make home cooked meals for you pet. it gives scientific evidence, backs up what it claims, and sites sources, which a lot of books on this subject fail to do. my problem with the book is opinion based. my opinion is that although it is better to feed your dog a homecooked meal over kibble, it is much better to feed raw over homecooked. and after reading this book i still stand firm in my belief that raw is the better way to go. but, if your a person who feels that homecooked is the way to go, then this is a good book to have. it's very detailed, and explains a lot on how much calories per day a dog/puppy should have, etc. also outlines meals that you can prepare."
3,feeding a reluctant eater,"This book is good for many dogs and cats with particular health problems, but my dog sends picky eaters to a new high. Sadly I found no help for this particular problem."
2,does not read easy,Tons of information however its hard to read (dry) Not user freindly if you just want to find specific nutrients important to the diet.
2,Dog & Cat Diets,"Throughlly researched, the book address health problems of cats and dogs. I would have enjoyed seeing more actual recipes. I had a little trouble distinguishing the discussions for dogs and the discussions for cats."
1,Disappointing,"I have several dogs, have been feeding them a raw meat diet for 2 years and have read many books on the subject. I wanted to make sure that I am including the correct nutrients so bought this book for the recipes. What a shame! All of the recipes in this book were variations of the same recipe: Cooked meat, bonemeal tablet and 1 multivitamin. Don't waste your time or money on this book. This is the first time I've ever sent a book back for a refund."
5,Great informative book,"Read this book cover to cover, great informative book on foods to feed your animals. Also discusses indepth how foods can effect your animals if they have certain skin conditions and allergies. Well worth the money!"
1,Waste of money,"I was so disappointed in this book, particulary after reading some of the glowing reviews. I can't believe it cost almost $40 for this paperback! I had to slog through pages and pages of information to find the recipes - and the amounts to make were in a different place in the book. The cat recipes are buried at the back of those for dogs, too - why couldn't he have separated out the info. for cats into a separate chapter!? The recipes are hard to follow (e.g., how much is 10 grains of bone meal? the only bone meal I could find was in a health food store and it's powdered - I have no idea how much to put in each batch). My cats won't touch most of the stuff I've concocted using this book and they still throw up the stuff they will eat (chicken and rice). I can't believe I'm stuck with this book now. What a waste of my hard-earned $$!!"
4,Healthy Dose of Preventative Care,"Lots of great recipes for cats and dogs, including special recipes for disease or allergies. Some ingredients are difficult to find, so search around. The book is written for a vet or someone in the industry, so it's not a simple petfood cookbook for your everyday animal lover. But it is pretty simple, really, just a collection of recipes.If I were to remake this book, I'd:- Organize the pages so there is only one recipe per page and no recipes were cut in half by a page change.- Suggest where to find certain ingredients- Give storage and serving information in the recipe, not the front of the book."
5,My dog has thrived on his Strombeck diet for 8 years,"My basset hound was born with an immune deficiency. To complicate matters, he ate a bunch of rocks and lost 5 of his 13 feet of small intestine to surgery when he was just over a year old. The vet prescribed a low residue diet on which he had constant diarrhea. He lost his coat and a great deal of weight before I decided to cook for him. I found Strombeck's book and have fed him the normal dog diet for the past 8 years. He is the picture of health. Skin looks great and diarrhea is controlled with the addition of Prozyme and live acidophilus capsules. The book is an indispensible part of my pet care library."
5,Amazing book,"I'm surprised at the amount of complaining with the cat recipes. I found the recipes for both dog and cat to be plentiful, well written, and easy to follow. I also obtained bone meal in powder form, but is it really that difficult to read the bottle, it tells you how much to give. I have used this book since purchasing it in June 2007 and have never been happier. We were about to lose our dog to Protein Losing Enteropathy (PLE)even though she was on a bunch of stuff from the vet, and this book is what brought her back. My vet was so impressed with the book that they bought a copy for themselves. I found it easy to find the recipes I needed just by going to the index. I had no dissapointments with this book and have recommended it to several people with both dogs and cats."
2,"Worked OK for a while, and then [quit]","It worked great for a few days, then started giving errors, and finally would no longer respond. It was probably just a defective unit, but I can't recommend it to others."
1,They're miracle pads- If you get the right size pads it'll be a miracle,There are thousands of Chrysler Town and Country mini-vans on the road but I received pads that didn't fit my 2003 LX. I returned them for a second set and guess what the second set didn't fit either. Amazon was nice enough to issue a refund after I decided against a third set.
5,Voyage to Perfect English,"The entire series of this text for all grade levels is superb! The text is a reprint of a classic which was used in the Catholic schools during the 1950 - 1960 era. This is an advanced English text which does not ""dumb down"" the mastery of language like the texts used today. I have used this series for all grade levels while homeschooling and I must say that the vocabulary and grammatical skills of my children are far superior to those of their peers, including those educated in today's Catholic school system. This series is used by Seton and other reputable curriculum providers for the homeschool industry."
3,Pub Rockin' Twang 0n the Borderline,"If you're a fan of Brinsley Schwarz, The Rumour, The Motors, Ducks Deluxe or 70's Pub Rock in general, this release might be for you. Martin Belmont delivers plenty of twang from his trusty Stratocaster and adds a Tejano twist with generous helpings of accordion. Mixing new originals with some choice covers and some nice instrumentals, Martin shows that he can step up and deliver the goods. He may not have the best voice in rock and he may not be a prolific writer, but this disc is just plain fun."
2,solar system toy review,The toy was ok for my son's solar system project - however it was very flimsy - one of the planets broke as we were assembling it. Then it comes with a glow in the dark paint - which dosen't even work!Wasn't the best buy....
3,Solar System Planetarium,I thought this would be a learning experience for my 8 year old. Instead it was frustrating and boring. The snap together planets did not work very well. The instructions were not clear. There was not explaination of how the planets should line up. Too much guess work.
3,Cheap plastic....,This toy as interesting as it may seem is made with cheap plastic and is not something a younger kid can construct alone. My child really only found interest in building and painting it then it found a place on a shelf and has yet to be touched again.
4,Great learning device,"My 6 year old had a great time painting and putting together all the planets ( with help). The glow in the dark paint is a nice touch, too. My favorite part of this item is that it tells you what the planets are and how far away they are from the sun. This information is on the sticks and might be missed, but I really like that they are on there."
3,Just OK,Not as much fur not color and put together as expected. It's not durable at all and not very engaging.
2,Not horrible but not good,"this game is ok at best barely a rental that will keep your intrest, do not spend fifty buck on this game unless you play online you would be retarded if you did not plan to play it online. Anyway the graphics are ok and tha AI is less that naverage well to cut to the chase everything about this game is either ok or mediocore. It just isn't very impressive. THe biggest plus is online and even that will not blow you away.This game is not worth much."
4,Review,I ordered this game and got it only three days later. Fast shipping =1star. The game was in perfect condition. Good quality =1star. The game had a manuel and you don't get that used with most games. Hard to find stuff =1star. But the best part is the game is fun. Fun game =1star. Total=4 stars
4,Delta Force Black Hawk Down,"This was a pretty good game. I really like how it has co-op, splitscreen, and online play. It's all pretty good with about....uhhh....20 weapons. I haven't done online play though, but overall its worth what you would pay for it.It's for sure worth buying."
4,Better than most shooters,"When i rented the game i was expecting something like SOCOM: US navy seals. I was very wrong. The graphics were pretty good, and i like the fact that there are medics. its really nice that you can ask your team to give you health and ammo, but the best party is that you can walk around freely in the vehicle! In a helicopter you can fall off the edge and die, or you can shoot out of the side and kill bad guys. you can't drive though, which bites, but its not a bad game. the online isn't half bad either because its not TO laggy, and you can change rolls in the middle of the game (medic to gunner or sniper etc.) if you like REALISTIC shooters, don't buy it, but if you like shooters that have SOME realism to the game, but have fanticys like healing, buy it."
2,a good game but way to short,the game was fun but its really to bad that i beat the games in just over 1 day. Its a waste of money esspecially if u dont have online.
4,"Good Multiplayer, Single player is not worth it","The single player is horrible; I did not even want to play past the second level.The multiplayer online was decent, however, it comes nowhere close to the standard in online shooters, Socom 2. I don't understand why other game companies can't take some good ideas from Socom and use it in their games. This game would be really good if it had online clans and a good friends list, but for some reason the developers didn't think of having that. IMO if they had those features, the game would be right up there with Socom.The maps on the multiplayer are very big and are really interesting. You can get into almost every building on every map. There are many maps to choose from, I think 23. There are four different roles that the players can choose to be.Rent this game...don't buy it."
4,Cancelled and replaced with $#*!... literally,"This is a charming, funny little show that couldn't hold enough of its lead or something like that. The ratings weren't terrible, and I was looking forward to a second season. Instead, they decided to go with a TV adaptation of a twitter account on CBS this year.I'll probably pick this up at some point. I've already seen all of them, but it will be fun to watch again in a year or so when I've forgotten most of the jokes and scenarios.Don't be hesitant about picking this up thinking that it just cuts out randomly. The finale offers enough closure that season 1 is a satisfying complete story on its own."
3,OVERPRICED,"My daughter had this item on LAST year's Christmas list and didn't get it so I got it for her this year. Because it's difficult to find, and I really wanted it for her, I paid the price, but it is definitely overpriced, esp. since it was a short-lived sitcom (reason #1) and it only contains two discs (reason #2). Many TV DVD series are MUCH cheaper, especially when they are older like this one. It arrived in plenty of time for our early Christmas, although I was concerned because when I shook it, it rattled (I was afraid the disc(s) were broken). However, they had just come out of their slot. I'd rate this a 5 had it been a better buy."
4,Nasty...Nihilistic..Nifty!,"If you like punk, metal, horror, torture, death, cannibalism, a dash of gothic gore, and chainsaw aggression, The Hookers make music for you. I love all that stuff, and currently the Hookers CD gets played a lot in my dungeon! Is this record a classic? Only time will tell. But this fan thinks the Hookers may be one album away from the ultimate nightmare sound."
1,This CD left alot to be desired!,"In the grand tradition of ""Black Metal"" The Hookers have followed all the rules. Profanity, loud guitars, and machine gun tempo. The problem is that they don't have the hook that most other bands of this genre do. I found this CD to be too complicated at times, and other times it seemed mundane. I am a huge fan of rock and metal music but I feel that this is not up to what they are able to do."
4,Word Perfect is almost perfect,"This version of WP is as good as its predecessors, and the conversion programs are better. Make it your default app for Word docs.There is only one problem I have come across so far. If you set Select mode to WP 9, it is still buggy; it takes some effort to select the text you want. You can always set the mode to the earlier version."
4,Always a good program,I have always liked WordPerfect better than word. My edition was getting old so I picked up this new one. It is a bit different but easy to navigate and has some great updates. I would recommend it for anyone needing lots or word processing.
3,Word processor and spreadsheet OK,The best part of the whole program is WordPerfect word processor and Quattropro the spreadsheet. The rest of the program is not worth anthing. I loaded the complete program and then uninstalled everything except the above.
3,It does not compare with what I already have,"By the way I returned the Home Edition, because I would prefer the standard edition."
1,poor quality system,"I bought these speakers hoping to have good sound, since the speakers my computer came with sounded awful. These speakers were a vast improvement, but they lack clarity, especially in the sub. The sub-wolfer is overpowered and does not put out a good bass sound, so you have to turn the bass way down for decent quality, but then there is a lack of bass. These speakers are also cheaply made, and the cords going into the sub feel loose, as if the connectors inside are falling off. Definitely looking for a new set of speakers!"
1,There is no place in the world called arabian gulf,"according to the United Nations resolutions in 1971 and 1984 the correct name of that place is PERSIAN GULF. it is a historical name that has 3000 years of hitory. the term perisan gulf does not belong to iranians but it is a cultural heritage of humanity, mentioned by herdotus and many other historians. The title of the book clearly shows that it is ordered by arab petro-dollars and there is little research value attached to it. it also shows how much corrupt and unjust some so-called researchers can be."
4,One of the best in the series,"The Shadow Academy asks a haunting question: What if the greatest hope for the Jedi's future were taught the most forbidden secrets of the Dark Side?This book provides an interesting exploration of the Force, and the nature of a Jedi's character."
5,SHADOW ACADEMY,"It is a non stop exciting book that you can't putdown. I have previously read the Jedi AcademyTrilogies and they are just excellent. I have readHeirs of the Force, The Lost Ones, and Lightsabersand I fully enjoy reading them."
4,Good continuation.,I am not a big hater of Mr. Anderson like a lot of people are. These were written to a younger audience and he achieved it. They are still interesting and these stories play a big part in the following books. I would recommend this book to Star Wars fans young and old. I'm sorry I waited to read these but it makes them more interesting knowing what happens to them later.
3,okay...,"I know Anderson is a better writer than this book, and that is taking it into consideration that this is a book for young adults, but this book was not up to his usual standards (read the first in the series, and you'll see he can write a young adult fiction well). First of all, I cannot believe that with the twins being kidnapped, Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and Lando (and remember, he is somewhat responsible) sat back and did nothing. That doesn't even fit with their character at all. I think the idea of the Shadow Academy is something Anderson should have used for his next trilogy...there was so much more that could have been done with this idea that just wasn't. I am greatly disappointed that ANderson let such a good story idea fall so flat."
3,Very disapointing sequal.,"I read the first one and I loved it and couldn't put it down. I thought it was very well written, but felt almost opposite about this one. I didn't like the plot or the way it was delivered. I might have had too high expectations for this book, but I didn't like it at all."
3,Speaker part doesn't work. Headset is great but....,Speaker part doesn't work. Headset works great by itself but hurts ear after a while. I wish the ear piece had a cushion and softer clip. Customer service is great. I broke my clip twice and they replaced it w/o any issue.
1,Waste Of Time,"Never heard from seller for 4 weeks,why post something for sale if you don't have or don't intend to sell it?Waste Of Time."
3,Daughter likes this,"My 11 year old daughter likes reading, and did like a few of these books. She got a bit bored with them though."
5,My second-grader's favorite series,"My 7yo daughter loves this series. She has read every book in the series multiple times, and she follows us around the house reading the funny parts. Franny K. Stein tickles her funny bone and inspires a love of science. Her favorite book is #6, but she likes this one, too."
4,TIGHT!,"THIS CD IS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED. THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT IT IS BECAUSE I HEARD CAMOFLAUGE WAS ON IT, AND HE WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE RAPPERS. CRIME AFFILIATES IS THE GROUP THAT HE USED TO BE WITH, AND THEY ARE TIGHT ASS RAPPERS TOO! IF YOU LIKE FLAUGE BUY IT. MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE DECAFFEINATED AND EYES WIDE OPEN.RIP CAMOFLAUGE!"
5,A truly excellent program of sequential phonics instruction.,"As soon as children know letter sounds, they can begin this sequential, six level program. Phonics skills are presented sequentially in the workbooks, beginning with short vowels and progressing to about a third grade reading level. The accompanying readers provide practice with each skill as soon as the appropriate workbook pages have been completed, so the child can actually READ the book. I have used this series as a crucial part of my Primary Learning Assistance reading program for about eight years, and cannot praise it highly enough."
4,beautiful,"This is a really beautiful necklace but the only downside was that the chain that it came with, although pretty, was much too small. It would probably only fit a child but that could easily be fixed by buying a new chain. The rose on the heart does not look cheap or poorly made; it is good quality and elegant. Overall I really like this necklace and recommend it for those that like this type of necklace!"
3,Just above average,This definitely is not the best of Tull albums. Particularly side A doesn't impress at all except for the title song Rock Island.Side B has some good numbers like Christmas song.Whalers dues and Strange Avenues are the one's which are very bluesy and really stands out and manages to pull the album above medioctity This album is the least impressive Tull album after Underwraps and Catfishrising.
1,This one sucks,"This is the worst JT album i've ever heard. Just the same as the previous CREST.. and the following CATFISH... These are all the same, lapse of spirit, really dead and dull songs.Dont like it."
2,Too graphic for my 3 year old.,"Sure, this book is based on a Burl Ives song which is ""fun"". However, the illustrations showing the fox killing the goose and holding it limp in his mouth and then bringing it home to his little foxes where they cook and eat it is simply too graphic for my 3 year old. Sure, everyone has to eat and foxes eat geese. We all die yet I am not ready to show my 3 year old pictures of dead people. Sorry to be a party pooper. I was really looking forward to reading this book to my son. When he is older I will. Not at age 3 or 4."
2,A bit creepy and pagan,"""The fox went out on a chilly night, and he prayed to the moon to give him light."" Thus begins this illustrated version of the old song, complete with the fox bowing his head in supplication to the moon (Artemis/Diana?). While the artwork is interesting, I would not call it beautiful or captivating. The moral of the story is that the moon must answer prayer, since the fox gets a goose and a duck, escapes the pursuing farmer, and enjoys the fowl meal with his canine companions in their underground home that is furnished with tables, chairs, a fireplace, etc.When looking for a children's book, I prefer something more wholesome with cheerful, uplifting and warm art and message. This one leaves us cold."
5,First Grade Votes THis #1,"Our teachewr knew the song that goes with this book. We love the pictures and the words, too. The pictures are funny and interesting and go with the song. Of all the songs we've learned this year, this one is #1!"
4,Very Cute,I used Coquette in a little girl's room I was designing. We were doing a French Pink Poodle theme and this poodle was adorable on her bed. It seemed to be very good quality and was so soft and squishy! The little girl loved it! Would recommend as an accent for a room. Would probably get dirty quickly if played with.
3,Confused by The Black Art,"I am not an electrical/electronics engineer and only have an intermediate programming experience. My concern with this book has to do with it's accuracy. I have lost faith in it due to the many mistakes I have found. I no longer trust what I read. And I am having a hard time following it through. For this pain, I am only giving the book 3 stars. Not a book for a novice in electronics."
3,Good book but read this first.,A book with lots of information. If you are new to electronics start with a book that takes it easy and explains things with examples and that has questions to test if you understand the chapter that you read. I would recommend it however because there is a lot of good info on game console design.I recommend you buy direct from the writers site though. The version sold on the amazon site is printed on demand and does NOT come with a cd. It is supposed to be downloaded from the publishers site but it isn't there. The author offered to send a cd himself! 5 stars for that!
4,Favorite book,My sister loved this book! It was one of our childhood favorites and it is in really good condition because it is a hard back old library book. She is very excited to have it. There are not tears on the pages and the plastic cover will help protect it!
2,DON'T BOTHER - LOOK FOR A ORIGINAL COPY ON VINYL,"THEY DID IT AGAIN - TAKING A MASTERPIECE AND BECAUSE OF GREED CHOPPING UP AND EDITING AWAY AN ENTIRE MELODY AND CUTTING DOWN ""I CAN'T KEEP FROM CRYING SOMETIME"" TO A LITTLE OVER THREE MINUTES. I WISH I HAD KNOWN BEFORE BUYING THIS, I SURE WOULDN'T HAVE WASTED MY MONEY. NEXT TIME I WILL READ THE REVIEWS - I LEARND MY LESSON."
4,A sonic mixed bag,"The remastered sound is interesting - I suspect a lot of the noodley bits and announcements may have been taken from vinyl, but the actual tracks appear to be from tape. They are brighter and have more hiss than the BGO remaster (which usually means that less NoNoise has been used - a good thing) We may have to await the official Chrysalis remaster this year for a definitive edition"
5,An Overlooked Gem,"Ten Years After is best known for ""I'd Love to Change the World,"" a staple of FM Classic Rock. But at their core, they were a terrific blues rock quartet, ably led by guitarist and vocalist Alvin Lee. This is a sound that was big in both Europe and the US at the time, when a new appreciation for the cannon of electric blues and boogie was finding fresh expression from a variety of talented and dedicated artists. Recorded in Europe, this record has some great slow blues, such as ""Help Me,"" and rave-ups such as ""I'm Goin' Home"" (better than the version from Woodstock), and ""Choo-choo Mama."" The quartet stretches out here, jamming ably with their straightforward and driving style, with a tight-but-loose rhythm section and tasty organ as well. A favorite record."
4,Ten Years After - 'Recorded Live' (Chrysalis) 4 1/2 stars,"My first time of getting to hear this classic live lp on CD reissue. I haven't heard this long player in eons. Total running time clocks in at 79:46. Wow. Not quite as out-standing as the much later Ten Years After release 'Live At The Fillmore East' 2-CD (see my review) but still a must-own. 'Recorded Live' was taped at four shows from the band's 1973 European tour - gigs from Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris. About every cut here kicks *ss - like ""One Of These Days"", the jamming ""You Give Me Loving"", the Ten Years After two-part classic ""I Can't Keep From Cryin', Sometimes"", ""Slow Blues In C"", the all-too familiar ""I'm Going Home"" and the awesome blues rocker ""Choo Choo Mama"". Also read somewhere that 'Recorded Live' was initially released to deter the demand for a poor-quality live Ten Years After bootleg record. Trust me on this, mission was more than fully accomplished."
4,Great music; sound quality is lacking,"I bought this CD hoping to recapture the experience of a live Alvin Lee/Ten Years After concert. I have seen them twice, both times in large venues, and they put on a show that must be seen and heard to be believed. Alvin Lee, Leo Lyons and company simply exuded so much energy. Those guys in concert were on a musical level that few others seem to attain; some rock performers half their age (or less) would do well to learn from the true masters of their craft. Professional musicianship, fantastic guitar riffs, LOUD and rocking all the way! However, my copy of this CD seems to be lacking in sound quality (even when I crank up the volume). To be sure, all the right songs are there, and the band is playing true to form (i.e. excellent), but the sound is just ""thin."" Maybe I just got stuck with a poor copy. Alvin Lee and TYA deserve 5 stars, but in all honesty I must rate this CD down a notch."
4,alvin lee's best live album,"An exceptional set of Ten Years After on tour in Europe in the early '70s. I CAN'T KEEP...EXTENSION ON CHORD ONE is worth the price of this CD alone but it also includes definitive versions of I'M GOING HOME; GOOD MORNING, LITTLE SCHOOLGIRL & CHOO CHOO MAMA. Lee and Chick Churchill on organ bring a few of these hard rockers to fantastic finishes."
4,sun ring,"i bought 2 1 of them was wrong size and gav to my sister n got an addl for myself..its a nice ring, just dont get it wet, supposed to b sterling silver, but turns finger black/green...my other sterling silver doesnt"
2,picture is deceiving,The picture leads one to think you will receive what is IN the picture. UNTRUE! Read the print. Don't look at the picture.
3,Kind of a slog.,"I'm about halfway through, and I'm not sure I'll finish. I do not find any of these characters to be particularly engaging and I'm not sure I care what happens to them. I adored Sunne in Splendour, which is why I picked up other Penman books. I trudged through Time and Chance... Devil's Brood is already on the shelf waiting for me ... and this one, When Christ, just seems really... long. Maybe I should be glad I started in the middle of this trilogy? (Or be sorry I bought all three books.)"
2,Too many characters,"I have read other works by SKP, and I must say that her books are just phenomenal. I loved ""The Reckoning"" and ""Falls the Shadows"".This book however starts out with a dramatic beguining, and a fine introduction of the main characters; but then, just around chapter 8 or 9, there is a number of earls, counts, barons, battles and sieges and it continues on and on for the entire 746 pages making this story a very confusing one indeed. Sometimes these characters are addressed by their titles only, so if you don't remember who was the ""Earl of This"" or the ""Count of That"", you really loose track of this novel, not to mention the numerous deflections and betrayals related in this voluminous book. Just in case you got frustrated reading this book, there is another book ""The Fatal Crown"" by Ellen Jones and is about the same story, Empress Maud and King Stephen but written in a much clearer style."
5,great read,I've read this book several times and it just keeps getting better with each read. It's definitely up there with The Sunne in Splendour as Penman's best. Another side of the same story is told in The Fatal Crown by Ellen Jones. Admittedly it's more fiction than history (as it focuses on a love affair between Maude and Stephen) but it's a good read all the same.
4,The Start of a Great Love Story,"I love historical fiction, and especially so when I am descended from the main characters, Henry II and Eleanor, as I am. That part of the book was great, as was Geoffrey of Anjou's encounter at the French Court with Louis VI? The battles in England between Maude's forces and Stephen's was repetitious and boring, but probably historical. I am so glad Penman included a note at the end where she delineated what was fiction and what was history. That helped a lot. Dialogue will always be fiction, but you can't write a book without it. Fun to guess what folks would have said and thought in situations. One thing that irritated me is that I have a photo in a history book of Stephen of Blois, King of England, last of the Normans, and he is cross eyed. WHAT? Not really the handsome, winesome man Penman described. Kind, and incompetent, yes. Handsome, no."
4,I'll admit it....,"I'm an Anglophile. I have a passion for British History. I picked this book up 6 months ago because it looked interesting and it is about a period of history that I am fascinated with. However, it sat on my shelf until last week, when I finally read it. I was immediately intrigued. The characters were well fleshed out and even the observers became important to me (at times I cared a little bit more about what happened to Ranulf than I did about what happened to Henry). There are attitudes and beliefs that are integral to the time period that she brings out in the story to make it even more realistic. I do agree with another reviewer though...it is hard to keep track of who is earl of what and whose side he is on. But overall, she makes the main characters so real that you are affected by what happens to them. Her writing also makes me actually able to visualize the setting. I think the book is extremely well written, and I can't wait until the next one in the series comes out."
3,"A good read, but definitely not her best work.","After the long buildup after the release of The Reckoning, I anxiously awaited Ms. Penman's next work. When I read WCAHSS, I loved it (as I love all Penman works) but I felt somewhat cheated by the introduction of fantastic character after character, only to see them disappear after a chapter.These characters could have easily been a ""mirror"" of the times for the reader, allowing us to view the world in a different point of view than of the royalty and nobility she always features.Perhaps my standards were a bit high (considering the subject matter -- I love the legends of Eleanor of Aquitaine), but I felt a bit cheated at the end.Hopefully this was an aberration and her next work(s) will resume the mantle established by the Here Be Dragons/Falls the Shadow/The Reckoning trilogy."
4,try it again,"Well, I must admit this is not the best SKP novel ever, and I did experience some slogging sensations and disorientation the first time I read it (see other reviews for more detail) BUT I found the storyline interesting. And soon after I read this, I read another novel on the same subject and that stunk like a skunk in an outhouse. So to get the 'stench' out of my brain, I read the SKP again. It was much better this time. The first time was like driving in heavy traffic -- too much going on to enjoy the scenery. The second time through was much more enjoyable. So I encourage every one to give it one slog and then read it again."
2,bummed,"I too was excited to dive into this book. Unfortunately, I didn't even make it past the first 300 pages. There were some great moments, but overall I started to get bored when I was reading about lets say, the brother of the uncles earl who had no relevant point to the story. I could see it being necessary to possibly build-up the main characters, but they did not in this book. I am not going to give up on SKP, but I have to take a break from her as this book put a bad taste in my mouth.I started reading Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follet and am having a hard time putting it down. You learn extensively about characters which ARE tied to other characters in the book who DO have relevance to the story as a whole."
3,My least favorite of Penman novels,"After reading the Welsh trilogy, this novel was a bit of a disappointment. I did not care for the character of Maude or Geoffrey, did not form an attachment for either of them, which makes in difficult to enjoy a novel. Perhaps this trilogy would have been better had she skipped the story of Henry's parents and started with him...the back and forth battling between Maude and Stephen was not very interesting, and this novel lacked the emotional impact of the Welsh trilogy. Took me awhile to get thru this book, but I did it simply so that I could read Time and Chance about the famous Eleanor of Aquitane."
3,Tedious at best,"The author is to be commended on the amount of research she must have done for this book. However, she makes a fascinating story extremely dull and tedious. The only realistic character was Ranulf and he was totally fictitious! If the subject matter itself hadn't been of prior interest to me, I'd never have gotten through this book."
2,I Tried,"I really, really tried to love this book. It hadn't hooked me by page 200 or so, so I don't think it ever would. I echo the sentiment of a previous reviewer that it is sad that Maude had her crown stolen by Stephen, and now her story as well. As far as I could tell, the story was more about Stephen, Geoffrey, and Maude's multitude of brothers. The subplots galore and the cast of thousands (with similar names) made the storyline very hard to follow, to say the least. When I caught myself grimacing at the thought of slogging through to the end, I gave it up."
2,An endless tale,This book is three times longer than needed! Feels as though Penman could not decide whom she wanted to be the central character.This book is not worth the effort to read. By story's end the characters are exhausted and so is the reader!
3,"Great detail, but lacks excitement","First time reading a Penman novel, I am used to Bernard Cornwell and Ken Folett. Compared to them, it seems I am reading a encyclopedia. I appreciated the rich history and truhfulness of this book, but it can be outright boring at times. Penman, descriptiong of the battle scenes seems distant and not very exciting. Any time something significant happenes, she never rights about it, the rout at Winchester, the exchange of Maude and Robert, she always tells these happenings from point of views after the fact. She is a good author, but if you are looking for an exciting and thrilling read, look elsewhere."
5,Great historical fiction,"In this lengthy novel, Sharon Kay Penman recounts the equally long conflict between Maude and Stephen that tore 12th century England apart.Don't let the book's size intimidate you. I'm a slow reader, but I found this story to be a real page-turner, chockfull of intrigues, betrayals, battles, sieges and narrow escapes. Some of the events--such as Maude climbing down a rope and escaping a besieged castle in a snowstorm--may seem farfetched, but they are firmly rooted in historical fact.I will definitely be reading other Penmen books in the near future."
2,Not correct,"It is has a cool and hard shell, but you cannot use the touchscreen. You have to open it everytime you have to use the phone. The stylus doesnt come out easily. The case is in the way. The groove has to be a little deeper."
3,Ehhhh...,"This purchase was made years ago, but since I am doing reviews, I thought I do this one as well.I loved that phone....LOVED IT....this case was just a basic cover. Which the phone needed...our phone got scratched.Flimsy."
2,was good while it lasted,"The case is very nice and very practical,specially with the swivel attachment.The problem is that I bought it in December and early june a part of it broke and now it is useless."
4,Great,"i reckon this film is so good, some people say that it was a bit corny but i think it was just so good and not to predictable."
4,great game but......,I really like this game but I miss the old weapons from CTR. I would be happy if it was a CTR but with new boards and everything else the same. I like the clashing option but it seems that if you don't clash with anyone you won't ever come in 1st place because the other cars go fast. When I do clash with someone I always do the shooting but then you miss the shortcuts and you don't get a full view of the board. The boards are beautiful and the details and color are great! I also like how they combined the platforming with the racing and there is also a stunt and battle mode so this game has alot of different games in one. I wasn't happy with Crash Nitro Kart and I was afraid this would be like that but it's way better. I just have one question - when are they going to make a Crash Bash 2?
3,"Eh, decent...","Yeah... This game is only kinda decent. I generally love Crash games, but this... I didn't really enjoy it as much as past Crash games. The new characters pretty much suck, the story and villain of the story suck, it's also a bit too easy. The racing could'v been a lot better. There could'v been a better selection of characters. The battles are fun, especially with friends, so there's a pro. The Die-O-Rama's are cool, so another pro. The humor is good, too, so another pro. Really the pros and cons are equal, so it's decent... -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,Not what I thought,"Game is fun but hard, I thought it would be more racing but havnet even gotten to that yet, can't get past 1st level. So just ok."
4,clash of Crash and CTR,"We have purchased CTR and CTR Nitro Kart as well as a couple of the Crash Bandicoot games. All were fun for many hours. Crash Tag Team Racing seems to be the result of a ""clash"" between Crash and CTR. A ""clash"" is a new feature of this game in which two vehicles combine into a super vehicle. The resulting game has many of the features of each of the previous games and is fun. Some of the charm of the individual battle mode of the previous CTR games is missed as it is a good way to work outday to day frustrations."
5,great game,"Had this game in the 90's, loved it. Happy to have another one. Also my kids love playing it."
4,Into the Night Music....,"I defy anyone to listen to 14 Years and not go back to a lost love...Picked this up along with Five Deez Koolmotor Instrumental after hearing pieces of both on Adult Swim....Mellow....very very mellow....And just as suitable in the car as on the home front. Sound quality could stand improvement, but it still doesn't distract from some very smooth sounds....The kind of sounds you hear, stop what you're doing...and think about something...normally something on the uptake..."
5,A frog and peachy book....,"When I was in college in the mid 70's, I saw Peter Cook and Dudley Moore open their Broadway version of ""Good Evening"" by passing each other on stage, turning their heads, and gently saying, ""Hello."" If you know some of the skits, you'll enjoy the occasional discrepencies, as those that made it to recordings had been tweaked with improvised additions and improvements. If you don't know the skits, you'll probably be adding some of these to your favorites by Bob and Ray, Morcombe and Wise, Dave Allen, Monty Python talk show parodies, and so on. The writing is witty and mostly subtle, with the well placed ""groaners."" Mostly, the book is a tribute to a humorist who didn't quite become a household name in every household (at least in the US), but who should have."
2,I'm still waiting for Cook to live up to the hype,"Clive James said: ""In an hour of casual talk he spilled out enough wit and perception---in him the two things were uncommonly near allied---to keep anybody else going for a whole television series. That was the cruel fact which so few of his obituarists, even at their most laudatory, could bring themselves to face: he wasn't just a genius, he had the genius's impatience with the whole idea of doing something *again*. He reinvented an art form, exhausted its possibilities, and just left it.""After all the pious testimony about Cook's genius, I was hoping this book would convince me of it. It didn't. Most of Cook's newspaper writings are submediocre. And the intermittent brilliance of his interview improvisations is just that---intermittent. William Cook's essay is a masterpiece. It's just a shame that Peter Cook was a lazy wastrel who failed to live up to his potential."
4,Prepare to be challenged!,"Sexual sin is one of the greatest problems in the world today. Too often, even the most respected men bring tragedy upon their families when they succumb to these temptations.Many of us mistakenly assume that God doesn't care about our lustful THOUGHTS... just as long as we don't ACT on them. As a result, we end up living double lives, never anticipating that the secret imaginations we've had for years could end up destroying our marriages, our careers, and our ministries.Merlin Carothers uses plenty of scripture and real-life examples to motivate you to stay pure, both in actions and thoughts. His no-compromise message can put you on the path to a genuine, non-hypocritical life of godly living and godly thinking. If you let it, this book will change your life!"
1,the size of this bag is for X40,I don't know why the other reports said this bag can contain17' laptop. No Way the bag I bought. It's small. I cannot put my T21 into it.
1,No Size Information...Will not fit 17 Inch Laptop,"The reviews all are misleading on this item. The actual size of the case is 10 Inches x 11 Inches (approximate). All the other reviews are for other products than the one shown in the ad which does not specify laptop size other that the brand (Think Pad). I am not pleased that 17"" screens are mentioned in all of the reviews and buried at the bottom of the reviews is the statement that the review is for an alternate selection which when investigated turns out to be an entirely different product."
4,The First of Men: A Life of George Washington,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It gave a side of George Washington I never learned in any of my history classes. It showed a very human side of him that I found facinating. Contrary to what history has taught us, he was as flawed as most of us are. But in spite of those flaws he still was a great patriot and man to be respected."
2,"Well Written, but negative on Washington","John Ferling is a good writer, but don't count him as being enamored of George Washington. Let's just say he is neutral about him. Ferling even criticizes GW for not being an abolitionist before the Revolutionary War.Ferling's constant nit picking against Washington gets on your nerves after a while. I can't recommend this book.I would pick up Flexner's book about George Washington instead."
1,WOW! THIS STINKS WORSE THAN MJ's INVINCIBLE CD!!!,"I don't know what to add someone else hasn't. It's like they took every MJ cliche, added every tabloid story and some common known facts and wrote a script out of it inside of an hour. Joseph Jackson looks cartoonish with that cheap wig-fro and an UZI!!!! LOL!! The actor that played MJ sounded like he took 10 vicodin's before every line. The broad they had play Liz Taylor looked like an old $20 crack-hooker. It's just bad....and not as in the album, as in HORRID! There is no MJ music in it and the generic music they did use sounds terrible! This is NOT a tribute to a legendary superstar just a tribute to first year film student projects that get an F!"
1,Crap,Hated it its a very bad portryal of Michael Jackson. The acting is awful and the face of the man who plays Michael Jackson goes grey for soem time. Not this is not good at all.
2,Wack..but hilarious,"This movie was corny, but it is very funny. I could not help but laugh at how cheesy everything was. Not only is this movie extremely corny, but it looks like it was made on a $100 budget. However, if you have a sense of humor, you should definitely see this movie."
1,the worst movie about michael jackson...,"granted, only the jacksons: an american dream, portrays the true mj and the only one in a positive light...and i understand for production companies, it's better to make money than tell the truth. but i saw this on vh1, and the actor is so bad at portraying mj. first off, michael stood and walked normally, why they had 'mj' shifting around so much always being bent over is beyond me. and second, any real fan and anyone with intelligence knows, when a movie is done about a person's life and they don't get that individual's consent...chances are, there's some false things in that movie. i think vh1 should never again show this movie and issue an apology to the mj estate. if it wasn't for michael jackson, there would be no mtv and vh1 today."
4,MJ Man in Mirror,"I believe that Flex Alexander did a fantastic job of playing MJ in this film. He had the voice and put so much of MJ's real feelings into this film. You can actually tell how much MJ was hurting when the allegations were happening. Flex did a great job!!! He was so softhearted, and loving like the real MJ!! If you are a true hearted MJ fan, Get this movie!!!!"
1,The Worst!,I wish I didn't even have to rate this one star because it doesn't even deserve that. This has got to be the WORST movie ever made. Please don't waste your hard earned money on this crap. The acting (if you want to call it acting) was horrible. The story line was horrible. Flex (who is playing Michael) is horrible. The entire movie was horrible. It is a total disgrace to Michael Jackson. Who ever directed and produced this should be ashamed of themselves. Don't waste your time or money.
1,Terrible movie!,"This movie was horrible in depicting the life of Michael Jackson! The movie highlights selected controversial scenes of his life and then ends with the viewer drawing their own conclusion of the trial. Flex personifies Michael as a weak, childish, goofy individual! It's really disgusting- from my point of view. I threw this movie in the garbage as soon as I saw the content. It appeared as something that was thrown together to be 'a Michael Jackson life story'. From one fan to another- don't buy it. If you are just a movie watcher- it's not worth your money or time. This is a sincere and honest critique."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER ...TRY AGAIN VH1,"Was actually looking foward to this movie when it aired on VH1 ...but to my suprise it was HORRIBLE. WORST MOVIE EVER. 1st off the actors looked nothing like the real people. I mean Flex alxander as Michael. wow. the film skipped over a lot a years. What about the ""bad"" or ""dangerous"" eras ?? It just seem to focuse on the plastic surgerys , a little on his marriage to lisa marie and somewhat on neverland and the court cases. This film could have been done wayyyyyyyy better . Omg. AND VH1 did this? they should be embrassed. It also put michael in a bad light. The other movie "" the jackson : an american dream"" was a hurderd times better and told more of story .this film just kinda bounced around and didn't explian much of anything. I am hoping that now since Michael passed , that a new and better movie will come out that will explain the last few years of his life and show ALL of his solo carrer. Don't even waste your time with this film. It's not even worth renting."
2,"So bad, it's funny!","Are you looking to watch a movie that will have you rolling on the floor laughing? Did you just have a bad break up and need some comedy and entertainment? Are you very bored and need something funny to pass the time? Then rent this movie!This movie is so bad it's funny! Had me and my boyfriend in stitches. The acting was horrible, Flex looked like an idiot with white paint smeared on his face. And when he ""danced like Michael"", oh my God, it is so corny and awful. You'll laugh so hard your stomach will hurt! Want to watch a true, interesting, and quality movie of Michael Jackson's life? Then don't watch this! But if you want to see a horrible reenactment of MJ's life that will have you in stitches, then this is the movie for you!"
1,Bad and not in a good way....,"This movie was one of the worst ever. White powder on Flex Alexander's face and his fake Michael Jackson impersonation was so comical, my children laughed through the entire movie. ""She doesn't believe in Neverland"" is the worst quote of the movie and the most comical ever. A very bad attempt to exploit Mr. Jackson."
1,Watch it the tv guide channel.,"This movie was like watching train reck that I could not look away from. There was so many things wrong with the story and timeline. The people who made this had Michael Jackson looking like a man with out a back bone. The events were out of place, the plastic surgeries scenes weird and most disturbing to me his skin color not right at all. They were not consistant on that deail at all. The way they had it was that he still had dark skin when he met Lisa Marie in 1992 and he did not. She was still married when the first started talking and he did want to have sex with her before they got married. They had a far better wedding in this movie then they did in real life and they skip over the BAD album all together. Which is a pretty good album if people would just listen to it, I love all his albums from Motown Jackson 5 to Invincible. My point is if you want to see this this movie watch it on tv and save your money. Or better yet don't watch it at all."
3,Man in the Mirror,"Fair biography. Portrayal of Michael a little wimpy. Did not show his artistic genius, but showed a fair image of him personally."
4,Good movie,"Recommended for any true MJ fan. I wasn't that impressed with the actor chosen to portray MJ, but he did a fairly good job. Some parts were obviously dramatized for effect and didn't rely on ""fact"", but it was still worth purchasing and watching."
2,What can I say?,"This man is found not guilty on all 10 counts of child molestation charges among numerous charges. Zero. This man should deserve what he gets. Yes I was a lil' impressed about this flick I seen from VH1 of last year and tryin' to figure out what's going on behind Michael and why he was messed up inside fooling 'round w/ children (white boys I mean). I can't say enuff 'bout this. But ppl should just give this 1 'mo shot and believe the currently or ex- King of Pop is no wrong for this. Pretty decent acting to the role but it's all good. I may not buy it if I don't have too. But just keep in mind that Michael Jackson the King of Pop is the star of our time and our world. No matter if u luv him, hate him, or not, he's truly gonna remain the same like Whitney and Bobby, R. Kelly, among others."
5,man in the mirror,"I love Michael Jackson...he was an inspiration to all...this book is amazing..Great price, great condition and arrived in good time...Thanks"
5,Michael's story,"This is a very good movie about Michael Jackson's life. It shows him a little bit as a child. But it mostly starts with his performance at the Mowtown's 25th anniversary. And shows many performances, Neverland Ranch, and goes through his child molestion charges. This is a very good movie for Michael Jackson fans."
1,A FALSE DEPICTION AND REALLY BAD ACTING,Don't waste you money on this - the acting is beyond awful - totally cheesy - and makes MJ and Elizabeth Taylor look like phony idiots. The makeup is really bad also - it couldn't be worse. The whole thing leaves you with a sicking feeling about the man we love. It should be boycotted by all true MJ fans. Really horrible.
1,Horrible from Beginning To End,"Speaking from the viewpoint of someone who is a Michael Jackson fan, I felt that this movie was horrible. I absolutely love Michael Jackson and I felt that this movie did him no justice whatsoever. The acting was terrible and i felt that it was a mockery rather than a adequate portrayal of MJ. The movie left out so many details of his life. In the movie as they showed Michael's skin lighten, the makeup that was used on Flex (the actor playing MJ) was just outrageous, It just looked plain ridiculous. Flex looked like a clown and a mime at some points in the film. The movie contained no Mj music, (No ""Billie Jean"", ""Beat It"", Jackson 5 hits, ""Man in the Mirror"") Nothing! I wouldn't recommend this movie to a can of worms. If you want a better essence of Michael Jackson buy ""The Jackson 5: An American Dream"" although this movie follows the development of the Jackson 5 as a group it gave a better representation of Michael."
1,Another tabloid tale,"I am interested in historical facts and anything that is Michael Jackson or the Jackson family right now. This is just another tabloid tale as far as I am concerned. You need some solid proof before ranting on about a persons very personal life and habits. I look forward to a straight factual account of the life of Michael Jackson one day. That will be a collector item that will sell, sell, sell. I say to the people who are interested in biographies; don't waste your time reading dirt written by people who exploit rumors about famous people for their own personal gain. That's all I have to say."
1,Flex - Just Say No!................ Pure Tabloid..............,I'm not sure what Flex was smoking on when he decided to take this role. This movie is about as entertaining as seeing your favorite entertainer taking a dump.
1,poorly done,"This movie was poorly done. The acting was bad the storyline was all over the place and the entire thing was a mess.Flex alexander looks nothing like michael jackson, the makeup they put on him was horrible. It looked like a container of powder was thrown on his face. There was also no singing in the movie. This movie is not worth watching it's actually embarassing to see."
2,Not keen,"This was kinda shit, I'm not sure if it portrays Michael as he really was or not as I never met him or anything but shows him in a bit of a negative light and I'd like to believe he wasn't like that."
2,A very cheesy movie about the Late King of Pop,"Why was this movie even made in the first place!?! The Jacksons: An American Dream is the best movie to have in your Michael Jackson collection; there's better acting, more believable events (the whole Elizabeth Taylor and Michael scene of them in the bed was stupid! it made it seem like female bonding happening...just plain TERRIBLE!)Man in the Mirror is a cheesy movie, and yeah I laughed at times...but only because of how cheesy it is. This movie was and still is just an insult to the Late King of Pop and those around him. I mean goodness, they could have at least gotten some better looking actors for the movie...and why wasn't there any Michael Jackson music played? *Rest in Peace Michael Joseph Jackson*"
1,Bad purchase,"This is without any doubt the most horrible ""movie"" on Michael I have ever seen! I could not even watch the whole thing. It has turned out to be a dissapointment. Don't waste your money on it. Take the money you were going to spend on it and buy yourself J. Randy Taraborrelli's ""Michael Jackson, The Magic, The Madness, The Whole Story"" This book is un-bias, and will no doubt give you what you seek to know on Michael.Rest in Peace Michael, we all love you...."
1,Bait and Switch-Product not delivered,"The owner of the product had it listed for $6.96 and I purchased it around 5pm the day MJ died. My credit card was accepted and I was charged for shipping. The owner refused to send the item to me. I received a refund notice a few days later. When I purchased this item, it said ""in stock"". Once MJ died, the owner failed to provide the item saying he sold it before I was charged for it. If that is the case, he falsely advertised the availability of this item. This was not fair and I will never buy anything from this seller again."
1,A painful experience,"This of this a $2.00 continuation of Jacksons: An American Dream. The acting is horrible, MJ actor does not pull of MJ in any respect, No MJ music is feautured in the film. Every other made for TV movie tops this in every regard. I watched out of sheer curiosity because I am a huge MJ fan. On the defensive side, it does portray MJ as excentric rather than a child molester which I feel is justified because he is excentric, but not nessacarily in a bad way. If you are a huge MJ fan you may want to see this, but if you are not, don't waist your time."
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE!,JUST TERRIBLE. IF YOU DID'NT WANT TO CATCH IT FOR FREE ON VH1..WHY WOULD YOU PAY FOR IT ON DVD? TERRIBLE MOVIE. FLEX IS TOO BLACK AND TOO TALL TO BE MJ. WHAT A WASTE! THE REAL MICHEAL JACKSON MOVIE IS THE ONE WITH ANGELA BASSET AND LAWRENCE HILTON JACOBS. TRUST ME. THIS MOVIE IS A WASTE!
1,UNREAL,"A friend of mine told me it was awful. But you know sometimes ""bad"" movies can still be entertaining. Sometimes they are so ""bad"" that they are funny. Man in the Mirror-The Michael Jackson Story, even failed on this level. This movie was so bad that I was not only unable to laugh at it, but it mede me ANGRY.DO NOT spend your money on this."
2,This movie is really bad,"I didn't however buy this on DVD or rent it, actually i did see it however on TV once, and I think Michael was the most wonderful and beautiful man. I feel like the movie itself made it look like he was easily manipulated, what i believe is that he put up with a lot of crap from the paparazzi, media, tabloids and who knows what else. I wouldn't say anything about the actors who were in the show itself, i just believe it is bad judgment towards Michael. Whoever wants to buy the DVD should think twice about the movie itself. Because this show is not for any MJ fan at all.The movie in fact is sad, a bit depressing, and shows a lot of events that happened.In fact this movie deserves no stars or credit at all."
1,Don't waste your money on this mess.....,"To anyone that is thinking about buying or watching this movie,for the love of God, DON'T! Please DO NOT be fooled by the rest of the reviews that give praise to this crappy depiction about Michael Jackson. This movie didn't reflect who Michael Jackson is. Flex made Michael look goofy and idiotic. Put aside his personal struggles, we all know Michael is known for his singing and his dancing and this guy, couldn't even bust out and do the moonwalk or even one of Michael's tornado spins!(I know no one compares to Michael, but he could have made his role of the king of pop a little more believable). Added to that, not one character in this movie even comes close to resembling who is being portrayed. Bottom line is, don't waste your time or money."
1,"Simplistic, poorly executed and inaccurate!","The acting is horrible, the storyline is inadequate, inaccurate, and just overall poorly executed. Who actually gave this movie the green light to ever be made much less released?"
1,Grave Disappointment,"I am sorry to say that this is the most disappointing DVD I have ever watched. I kept watching to see if it would get better but it never did. The acting is terrible. The characters are not believable. As soon as I took the DVD out of the DVD player I had to play short movies of the real Michael Jackson just to get the image of the inpersonator out of my head. Luckily, I did not buy this DVD I borrowed it from the library."
1,Total and utter rubbish,Absolute worst rubbish EVER! Please do not waste your money or further demean the name of MJ by watching it.Have to give it one star to rate it - but it shouldn't have any!!
1,Don't waste your money,This movie was the worst acted and worst produced piece of junk I have ever seen. Don't waste your money on this trash.
2,a classic and valuable book but a deficient edition,A new edition of this important book is welcome but I I have to complain the innacurated edition. The text is a bad photograph of an old edition. So bad that in some parts is near illegible.
4,excellent pronation control and overall foot stability,"Only downside; they only last 3 months before my feet start aching again and they are over $100 a pair! But I do wear them just about all the time, not only when ""fitness walking"" or when at the gym. I am so impressed with these sneakers and how good my feet feel in them, that I am back here purchasing another pair, downsides or not. To describe these sneakers in 2 words: supportive and soft."
4,"Comfy - Yes; Stability - So, So","Very comfortable sneaker but could be more stabilizing. I have moderate pronation and am a little disappointed in the shoe's performance in this regard. Great looking sneaker, by the way. I would not buy another pair just because of the less-than-great pronation control for me."
3,A helpful guide to moon phases ~ heavy on Western Astrology,"This was the first ""Whitches' Almanac"" that I'd ever purchased. I was looking for something that included moon phases and information, which it provided. It also offered other tidbits of calendar info like birthdates' of interesting people, Chinese astrological info, names for full moons, etc. It also included suggested tasks and/or meditations for most calendar days. The articles were interesting, but certainly not earth shattering. It also provided astrological predictions for all 12 birth signs. My only complaint is that the calendar section is divided into zodiac signs, though I aware of this before I bought it. On the plus side though, if your focus is astrology then this may be the yearly almanac for you. Also the moon phases, and placement in the astrological houses, is computed for EST."
4,Good Gift,I bought it for my Boyfriend who loves Bulbasaur. He loved it. was what I expected and I would buy it again or another pokemon. arrived quickly.
4,So Many Recipes!,"I purchased SweetSips 2 about a year ago and there are so many recipes to choose from that it is hard to know which one to do first! They have all turned out so well and the food and drink recipes really add a nice touch to our home entertaining.We have also saved a lot of money by making our own liqueurs rather than buying them from the package store. Also, there are many recipes for liqueurs we can not even find in our area. We have also used the basic techniques to create our own special recipes and shared them with Charles Thomas who sends us new recipes for us to try out and critique. He is so much fun! Thank you Charles!"
4,A great addition to your collection.,"Chicago is one of the greatest musicals written in the second half of the 20th century. I have three different versions of the show - this recording, the original revival cast and the movie soundtrack. This recording of the original version captures the greatness of the music and the feel of the 1920s era it's set in better than the rest. If you're expecting what you heard in the movie, you'll be surprised. The soundtrack has the feel of being in smoky nightclubs, but that also carries over to the voices of Roxie and Velma. I think Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta-Jones sang with better voices, but they did not capture the feel of the show as well. Other than that, I don't have anything to say about it that others haven't said previously in the review section. When I want to listen to this show, this is the CD that I almost always reach for."
2,One big problem...,Love the case...buttons work fine for me...but 1 BIG problem...it dyed the back of my MP3 player black! Not cool.
3,it's okay....,"It fits the Zen better than I thought it would. I needed to stretch it out just a little bit and it worked okay but the bottom buttons on the Zen would push down without any force from my finger. Annoying sometimes but a little more stretching and it's fine. The whole 'stand' part is kind of a joke because the slightest touch and it will fall over. I like the flip cover thing on it to protect it but it sucks as a stand. I would recommend this case if you put it in and take it out of your pocket or purse a lot. But if you plan on using your Zen in your car like I do, this case just gets in the way."
2,Format makes novel incoherent. Poor job.,"Marion Harland was a Southern writer of ""the big misunderstanding"" romances. The heroine suffers conflict due to love denied or delayed. There are usually many trials and sorrows before her happy ending.Unfortunately, this is a review of the feeble, useless e-book formatting. It made the book utterly incoherent and a labor to read.I would suggest reading this book in paper print. Save yourself the frustration of floating paragraphs, weird punctuation and words that are split in two.Example of the formatting:""Shall I soon forget how shocked, silly I was, howdisappointed my wiser mother appeared, when wereceived the letterwritten at the close of his college course,announcing his choice""End of actual formatting Example. It gives me a headache.This Kindle edition is not recommended due to formatting errors.The novel is entertaining. I'd suggest trying to find it in hardcover."
1,Production Problems?,"After reading the 'good picture' reviews from all the others, I have experienced the opposite. compared to a bl-c10a that I have, a bl-c30a had a very fuzzy picture. It is clear from 8 inches to 4 ft. Beyond that it is fuzzy. After and exchange the 2nd one is exactly the same. Clearly some kind of lens problem. Panasonic spt, told me to upgrade FW and closed the ticket. (I had the latest FW already) lousy spt. Also, The 'WEP OPEN spt', no WPA bothers me. Of course means your whole wireless has to be less secure. Wireless G, continuously losses 3 to 10% of packets 2 ft from the router, what is up with this? I hope this is not the New Panasonic, cause my $3000 plasma is Panasonic... Im looking for something with PTZ, VGA, 30fps that I can afford, for security... Returned both, may return CL-10A, because I want one app for multi-cameras..."
4,Overall good product,"Over all it is a great product. The picture quality is not quite what I was expecting but maybe that was my problem for not researching deeper.I had a little trouble getting it set up but tech support was all I could wish it to be and my problems were soon taken care of.Being able to have my friends watch the deer and turkey in the back yard with me is great.The software and site that comes with the camera works flawlessly.I really like the camera and I actually have it set up outside under my eaves, out of the weather and it has worked fine even in the below zero weather we have been having and the recent thaw and rain.I think it is a fine system and the only problem I have is with the quality of the picture. My grandkids don't seem to care when they are watching the deer from their homes though."
2,Obsolete security,"This camera doesn't support the newer form of wireless security (WPA), but only the older and no-longer-secure WEP. In order to use this camera on my wireless network, I'd have to use the outdated WEP for the entire network, not just the camera."
4,Happy until I changed routers,"The camera is as advertised; the wireless and web-functionality is great; and it's compatible with WEP & MAC filtering security (802.11g). That was fine until I changed routers, and I now use WPA security ... which this camera cannot handle. So, until there is a firmware upgrade, or I decide to run wires (not likely), it's just on a shelf."
4,Panasonic BL-C30A net camera,"We have used the camera for about a month, and it has worked well. Set up was not too bad. Hung it outside on the porch, and in the freezing winter weather, it continued to move and record flawlessly. Good color and image resolution. Wish it had a slightly greater panning width. It was easy to set it to email pictures to me at work if anyone triggered the infrared sensor by coming to our door. Only negative was the software for automated storage of video images didn't work. Must have had a defect in it. Overall, a good security device, and a nice toy. Hope it works as well in a year now as it does now."
5,Low Cost High Performance Easy To Use,"I bought the Panasonic BL-C30 as a replacement for the Veo Wireless Observer. Both are approximately the same price $299, but can be found priced lower on the Web. There are several issues that make the BL-C30 a superior pick over the Veo as well as other competitors. First is the ease of installation, the BL-C30 uses an Ethernet cable connection for set up while the Veo uses a propriety Rs232 cable. This is one to the reasons I purchased the Veo, because I could not find the cable to reset one of the Veo cameras.The other advantage of the Panasonic is the software. Both in set up and operation, the BL-C30 performed without problems, not so with the Veo which is problematic in both set up and operation. Bottom line the Panasonic BL-C30 is easy to set up and use and for the price, a good choice for home security. I highly recommend it!"
4,good all-round net camera,"i did alot of research for a net camera and decided to go w/ blc30a because of its wireless feature, design, and price(of course, panasonic brand). I'ev had it for over 3 months already, so far, it runs really well. The setting is quite abit confusing but if you follow the instruction, it shouldn't be hard to set up the wireless part of the camera. the pam and tilt on this camera is nice. if only the video were 30fps instead of 15fps.3.5/5 stars"
3,"Does not support WPA, only WEP encryption","In other words, if your wireless network uses WPA encryption, you'll need the BL-C131 (unless you intend on using this camera by wiring it to your router directly). I wish Panasonic or Amazon's websites had provided that information somewhere, before I started installing the software (you will need a Windows machine, as there is no Mac OS version - what is up with that too?). No plans from Panasonic to include WPA encryption in firmware updates."
1,Get the 131A instead,"My C30A first wouldn't connect at all, so I sent it back. Bad board, they said. Still wouldn't connect. Bad solder, they said. Now it will only connect wired. I have a 111 (wired) and a 131, both work great, which is why I figured stick with Panasonic. I can't see the difference between the C30 and the other two, so go with them if they are available. Setup isn't too difficult but not exactly PNP, either."
2,Poor Performer,Camera very slow to respond to commands. Needs to be reset almost daily. Picture quality not as good as my other Linksys 54G cameras. Can't connect at all most of the time.
3,Does NOT support WAP,"This is a good product in general but it does not support WAP encryption, which has become the standard !"
2,Panasonic Wireless 802.11 b/g Network Camera (BL-C30A),"I purchased this camera for the purposes of using it to monitor my house while at work. After getting the camera to work by changing my router security to a less secure setting, I thought I could live with that.When I got to work the next day, our IT security has the settings set to not allow Active X plugins. This made the camera useless as I was not able to view any of the images that it produced.The set-up was pretty straight forward except for the security settings drawback. The software worked well for setting up the angle and viewing of objects with the camera and was overall pretty good."
4,Very Good Internet Camera,"Bought the camera last week. I really like this small camera and it has been working well so far (4 days).Good:1. easy to set up for the ethernet and wireless connection2. picture guality is good enough for monitoring purpose3. sensor, email and ftp features work nicely and easy toconfigure4. the pan/tilt and snapshot etc work well through IE browser5. can view the real-time snapshot on my Treo 650 smart phoneBad:1. if your isp requires authentication for SMTP relay, you haveto find SMTP for outgoing email that doesn't requireauthentication otherwise the email feature won't work2. tech support is not that helpful. I have to explain to theguy why email feature won't work unless someone can find aSMTP server that doesn't require authentication. He doesn'tknow well about the setupOverall, it is a very good internet camera and highly recommend it."
4,Not good on a Mac!,"First, I will say that this camera is great! The image is clear even in low light, and we found it pretty easy to set up with our Linksys wireless router. I did have a few questions and had an excellent experience with their customer service number--both times I got someone immediately who told me what to do.However, customer service told me that this camera will not stream video to a Mac! The next best option is to have the image refresh every 3 seconds. It is better than nothing, but I felt mislead from the info provided on Amazon. It works great on our PC, though."
1,The worst product ever.,"I can not even begin to explain how bad the UI, software and manual that came with this wireless web camera are.I have had it for 2 days and still can not get a single picture out of it. It just absolutely seems to hate every piece of hardware on my network.When it says it needs Windows XP - it means it. This is not a joke like Linksys or DLink trying to be cheap and only develop the internal server for IE and let Firefox and Safari users suck it up. This thing is an ActiveX monster. It will not deal with OS X, even through VPC - that I can tell.It seems to NOT want to let internet access happen either. I can get it up and see its internally generated webpages (no pictures tho) - but once I switch it to wireless I can get the login screen and then it just dumps on merefuses to let me log in.I hate this camera. I hate it. If I can't get it working by morning - its going back and Amazon can eat it."
1,support service really bad,Not only it is very difficuly to setup the support service representatives have no incentives to help you. Be aware!
2,Could not get wireless working,Great features for the price. Image quality is so-so but is as advertised. It worked great when using a wired connection. When I tried to connect using my AirportExtreme it was a no go. I tried everything. Removing security. Renaming the network. All I got was a flashing yellow light which makes trouble shooting pretty hard. Panasonic support tried to help but nothing worked. It is being returned.
3,A decent network camera,"Here are the things I like about the camera:1. You can remotely pan and tilt the camera.2. You can download recording software from the Panasonic web site. The software allows you to set many parameters. It also will record based on change in light rather than the built in sensor.3. It has decent resolution and recordability during daylight.4. Panasonic gives you a free web site to use for remote connection.Here are the things I don't like about the camera:1. It only works on wireless channel 11.2. It doesn't have low light capability. At dusk and dark any action is very blurred.I am happy with the camera given that I paid less than $300 for it. I would like to have a more expensive camera that has zoom and low light capability for outside surveillance. Since this is an indoor camera though, I would rate it a little better than average."
5,Easy to set up and works great.,"I just purchased this camera to use to keep an eye on my elderly parents. I followed the instructions to the letter and all went exactly as it should. The web viewing feature is especially good. The image quality is excellent and the entire set-up is far better than my previous set-up of trying to use a cheap webcam and yahoo messenger. A couple tips. Panasonic no longer makes this camera although it remains widely available. They have come out with a new version, the BLC-131 wireless. Tech support told me that it is the ""same camera with more features."" I have actually purchased a second camera since this one worked so well. You will encounter problems if your ISP blocks port 80 or plays other tricks to discourage you from runner a web server. Also, make sure your router is new enough to support UPnP, and that it is enabled before you try to set up the camera. Great product."
2,Just didn't work too often,"When it worked it was fine, but too often my system just would not recognize it. Only thing to do was reinstall it. But that gets tiring real fast. I'm running XP with a new Dell dual core so its not like my systems out of date. Finally gave up and returned it."
1,A collage of rumors,"It's not an impressive work. One portion of the book is a standard overview of slavery in Virginia, drawn from secondary or much-used primary sources. The second portion discusses alleged ""black Confederates"" in the South, and uncritically accepts every rumor, alleged sighting, and unsupported account of mostly mythical ""black Confederates."" Never once does the author engage any critical faculties in looking at such accounts, nor does he explain how it is that none of these ""black Confederates"" show up in the records of the Confederacy, as opposed to ostensible sightings recorded by Union war correspondents, etc.An old saying fits the book well: ""What is good in it is not original, and what is original in it is not good."""
4,women climbers must read this!,"Rock and Roses is amongst the ""must reads"" for female climbers and mountaineers. There are so few books available about climbing/mountaineering with women's voices. This is one of the finest. It includes stories by women who were the first to push their own mental and physical limits and were very aware of the struggle (Rosie Andrews and Arlene Blum), as well as stories by women who took advantage of those open doors to push the grade (Alison Osius and Sibylle Hectell). The humor in many of these women, their ability to poke fun at themselves and at their goals, is a refreshing change from the male-dominated mountaineering literature."
3,Rock & Roses 2nd Edition Review,"This collection of essays provides some entertaining reading from humor (The Scarfer's Handbook by Alison Osius)and introspectives (Glimpses of Truth by Sally Moser), to history (Women On The Rocks ..., by Ruth Mendenhall). On content the book rates many stars. The editing is another matter as the text is laced with typo and grammatical errors. I found the frequency of such problems to distract from the impact of the stories."
4,"Part soapbox, Mostly hilarious","I'll admit that there was a (very short) stretch during this show where I felt Chris Rock got a bit carried away with his political and racial beefs. ""It's all right, if it's all white"" is funny once, not five times. I'm white, I can handle the ugly truth, but shoving it down my throat by using the stage as a soapbox isn't gonna make me laugh.If you've seen some of George Carlin's later shows, when he became far too 'preachy' with his political grievances, you know what I mean.Nevertheless, 90% of this show was Chris Rock at his finest and sharpest, and will have any fan glued, laughing 'til your face hurts."
2,maybe two or three laughs max,"I watched this Chris Rock special on television recently. I used to like Chris Rock. He was one of the funniest comedians on the planet. After watching this noise I no longer think so. It's 90 minutes of angry yelling. Parts of it degraded from stand-up to what seemed like a anti-white politcal rally. I mean at some points he wasn't even making jokes or trying to be funny, instead just shouting insults. Now, if all comedians had the same freedom of speech Chris Rock does here, then I wouldn't complain.In all, it was interesting and even worth watching, just not funny."
1,This sucked!,"Chris Rock used to be really funny. He hit his prime years ago with ""Bring the Pain"" and has slowly gone downhill since then. His movies are lame (or okay at best as long as he is a bit player) and his standup has never come close to ""Bring the Pain"" type funny. This standup had a couple of laughs but I didn't really care for the whole Al-Cracker thing at all (and I am not a thin-skinned individual or PC person). I think he just felt he was getting into ""sell-out"" status with his financial success and wanted to try and ""keep it real"". Sorry Chris, being offensive just to be offensive is not funny. And while Richard Pryor may be your idol...you can only dream of being 1/100th as funny as he was. Pryor said some offensive things but always had a point and was always FUNNY!! If you really do like Chris Rock though I suggest you check out ""Bring the Pain""...that was actually very funny. This is garbage and he SHOULD have been scared after watching a replay of his performance."
2,Big disappointment to Chris Rock fans,"What ruins this performance is his obvious sexist attitude towards women. He continually disrespects his wife, marriage, and women in general. He trashes married life, equates women to basically sexual objects for men, and his jokes are thick with teenage mentality. If you can get beyond that, and just focus on the rest of the material, it's funny at times and has some very insightful stuff in it about government and Americans."
1,Racist IMHO .,"Sorry guys but I agree with R. Robyn.First I don't think ""never Scared"" was funny and it is clearly not as good as ""Bigger & Blacker"" or even ""Bring the Pain"". The thing is when a guy makes a bunch of good things and gets people to love him, some people say that everything he does is just great even if it stinks.Second a black guy ranting about blacks is funny (Rock in Bring the Pain"") just like a white guy ranting about whites is (Carlin in ""Ur all diseased"") but any guy ranting about other races the way Rock did is not funny but racist.No white guy could've had Rock's ""blacks v niggas"" routine otherwise he would have been a (...) racist to all of you, think about it!"
5,Whatttt,Who doesn't like Chris ROck! I was definitely feeling this show! The Dvd is great and got to me in good condition. Shipping was pretty fast.
4,Must Have for Comedy Nights,"Shipping was fast and in perfect condition.For those that Love Comedy Nights or just need a break from reality, Chris Rock is a definite must have for the collection.Chris's comedy is clever, insightful, and hits topics that everyone can relate to. This particular show in my opinion is not one of his best but still very good and entertaining."
2,ahhhh not,Chris Rock - Never Scareddidn't like the way it was spliced together. Not as funny as others.
3,Falls Short,"While Rock is still brilliant and perceptive and always somewhat intriguing to listen to, ""Never Scared"" feels more like a sermon than a stand-up routine. Here, he seems almost bitter, his timing is off and the program loses momentum quite early. His rants about The Jacksons, R.Kelly, who ""real Americans"" are and his thoughts on marriage are the strongest bits, but the remainder of this material is woefully lacking in humor and often gets too repetitive to be enjoyable. He's finally run out of steam."
4,Chris Rock's best yet!,"I don't know how he does it, but Chris Rock has a way of turning the average bits and pieces of all our lives into something absolutely too funny for words! I will never understand how I can like someone so politically opposite me, yet I do! Chris Rock rocks 'em with this special!"
4,very good,"Very enjoyable and funny show. Starts slowly by poking fun at usual targets, but once on social/political turf, really shines.I suspect that folks who gave this show very low ratings prefer earlier, less mature Chris Rock spitting out profanities, but eventually saying nothing of any relevance.Of course, CR ain't Pryor, but is slowly developing his own style. It is pointless comparing him to classics. Pryor, Bruce..."
1,Don't be misled...,"This book IS NOT by Tom Osborne. It includes a foreword by Coach Osborne, but the cover and listing on Amazon are clearly intended to mislead people into thinking the book was authored by Tom Osborne. Nice marketing strategy, but bad publishing practice!"
5,The entire series is great!,I am so excited with this series. My little boy was so excited that he could read....the repetitive sight words in this series made it easy and gave him motivation to pick up another book right away!
5,Very pleased,"this was my first attempted to buy individual products to color my hair, I have always used clairol hair color; since i was 12, but this was awesome and saves me tons of money, thank you amazon for helping make that happen. :)"
2,Change to soyplex not good for me,"I loved the old maximum lift and the blonde beige hair color. I've tried to use this product and it it just isn't the same. I keep my hair very blonde and this makes my hair look drab a week or so after it is dyed. I like the way it makes my hair feel, but the results are not the same. If anyone knows where I can purchase a product similar to the old clairol please let me know. I will not be buying this product anymore and will have to find a new supplier."
3,Clairol Pure White 40Volume,I thought the Clairol Pure white was a hair dye or bleach. But it's not what I thought. It's just half of the mix to bleach or dye your hair. It's just the activater part. So I guess I was told wrong and wasted my money by buying it. I can get some thing cheper that does the job some where else.
1,Pompous is an understatement,"This book SUCKS. I suppose if you sit there and try to figure out what Ghemawat is actually trying to say, there might be some valuable nuggets in here. Sorry I didn't have the patience for that. Too bad he wrote this with such ridiculously long sentences that you will find yourself asleep and drooling on yourself before you finish a paragraph. Maybe if you are an elitist professor who thinks clear and concise language is too pedestrian you will enjoy this book."
2,Could be Better,"The text is very heavy on the theory and provides a good background in the subject matter. Less pompous writing style could make it more readable. There are numerous spelling errors and instances of the words confused (tack instead of track, stricture instead of structure). Maybe upcoming editions will be better."
1,Really disappointing and useless.,"This book is really disappointing. When the it was delivered at home, I thought the box was empty: the book is as thin as a magazine!The content is very theorical, completely useless for executives.Maybe OK for students who have no clue at all about what strategy is, but definitely useless for executives."
2,"Sorry, but no","This is one of the most poorly written books that I have been asked to read. I did not expect a strategic management book to be a page turner, but this takes comprehensible concepts and make them unreadable. The author has no cadence or flow to his writing. You have to reread a passage a couple of times to try to extract a pretty simple point.Save yourself some money; purchase a couple of reprints from the Harvard Business review, and you will be ahead of your peers who read this book."
2,"High-level material, not recommended for students or people new to the subject","Being an MBA student, I got to study this book for my ""Strategic Management"" course. I found the book material difficult to understand on my own without the help of the professor slides and explanations since the it touches different topics at a very high-level without going deeply into details and a good description of the tools and methods. Even the graphs are not self-explanatory and miss important information to help the reader understand them. In a nutshell, the book is not recommended for students or folks that are new to this subject but it might be useful for those who already have some preliminary knowledge on the topic."
3,"It's a textbook, what can I say...","I bought this because it was required for class. Supposedly reading it was required too. I got through class without reading it once, just fine. In hindsight, probably not worth spending my money on."
5,finally it's here,finally one of the best comedies made it to dvd. the music is great. the girls are great. and the comedy is great. that's all i have to say GOOD-BYE.
3,"Not much of a story, but quite hilarious.","Being a big Phoebe Cates fan, I just had to check out this one. While this movie is lacking in its storyline and definitely doesn't show Phoebe Cate's acting talents, it is a hilarious movie if you don't take it too seriously. Phoebe Cates look great in this one, so it's still a must-see movie if you're a fan."
4,Private School DVD review,"I'm glad this finally made it to DVD. After watching it in all of its cheesy glory, I must say, it's still good! Ok, ok, maybe it's just because Phoebe Cates is a goddess and Betsy Russell is so freakin hot. Russell randomly prances around flailing her exposed breasts around like it's nobody's business. In fact, just watching her top come off while horseback riding is completely off the wall, ridiculous, and awesome at the same time. Get this DVD if you like a bunch of random nudity. If you're into the typical 80s fare like Back to School, and Fast Times then you'll dig this movie. You can't be the type of person who cringes at cheesy, dated movies. If anything, get it for Phoebe Cates having sex on the beach."
4,Good old days,The Pranks and pleasures of youth. Sometimes it is fun to look back at the foolishness of youth. It sure was fun.
2,It was Bad,"You will expect to see more of Phoebe Cates. She didn't seem to be the main charater. She barely acted and the scenes she was in were really small. The film lacks a sense of purpose, and the comedy is not even fun. You wont be missing a lot if you dont see it."
1,For this movie read the one and two star reviews first ..........,"If you don't know how lame it is possible for a movie to be, watch this. Then you will know.This is the kind of movie that people leave off resumes and hope no-one will remember. There are occasional laughs, but most of the scene set-ups are so dopey that they pull you straight out of the movie and make you wonder what the director was thinking. The script is so bad that I guess he didn't have many options. Or maybe he got something better and then destroyed it. You won't know, and you won't care. You will just wish you had watched something else."
4,"bad movie, but............................................","Well this is a very difficult movie to judge. I would highly recommend it to any man who wants about 5-8 amazingly sexy scenes. Seriously, if you see those scenes....they are burned in forever. The movie itself? Well if you drink about 20 beers, after depriving yourself of sleep for 48 hours......it may seem un-predictable. Betsey Russell was a Goddess for sure!!!!!"
2,Young babes showing off their bodies,"The plot of this movie is very simple (and rather stupid); come up with an excuse for the young babes to show off their beautiful bodies. To correct the top reviewer - Betsy Russell does not ride a horse bare back; the horse had a saddle (and who would care anyway). Betsy Russell rides the horse TOPLESS. And as well endowed as she is, there is definitely a lot of bouncing. There is also a shower scene later in the movie that provides a whole group of young babes the opportunity to show how beautiful they are."
3,Mmmmm Betsy Russel,"I'm giving this movie 3 stars, purely for Betsy Russel, not that Phoebe Cates doesn't deserve some hottie points too. But man, I remember watching this as a kid on USA, and even late at night on CBS, falling in love with Betsy Russel and dying to see this movie unedited. I finally rented it recently and the shower scene is to die for! Not enough Betsy Russel skin but everything else was sweet! Did she come out in anything else? Anyway, watch this movie if you just want to see a stupid, hot 80's movie! This is as legendary as Cheryl Smith's Cinderella, which I have yet to see again since I was a kid watching it on scrambled Cinemax."
3,Brings back memories!,"I received this DVD last night and ordered it because of Phoebe Cates, who I am still in love with! She is such a beautiful woman!This movie is typical 80's fare, guys chasing women and trying to get some any way they can! That pretty much was a reflection of my own thinking at that time and loved these movies when they came out. Of course, throw in Phoebe Cates and potential skin shots, and I am there!Realistically, its not that great of a movie, unless you love Phoebe! That's pretty much the only reason I bought this movie!PS the sound is in MONO! I forgot that few movies were in stereo at that time!"
2,Marginal early 80's teen movie,"A trashy hormone driven teen movie. But--Betsy Russell has one of the best bodies I've ever seen, and I give it two stars for her best attribute--her chest. Whatever happened to her?"
2,PRIVATE SCHOOL,"I RENTED THIS WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT ON VHS. THE STORY WAS KIND OF DUMB ,BUT HEY IT HAD PHOEBE CATES. SHE MAY NOT HAVE DONE ANY NUDE SCENES, BUT SHE SURE LOOKED HOT IN THAT LEOTARD!!"
1,Really Bad,"It's just a typical 80's high school movie. I have no idea what kind of people will love it even die-hard Phoebe Cates's fan.If you're her fan,I suggest her much BETTER movies like Bodies,Rest&Motion or Princess Caraboo."
5,Made in Japan!,"Those of you wondering about this battery's capacity, it's 2100mAh and made in Japan, yes, not in China as competitive brands. I've 8 of these and workig perfectly for more than a year now. It's organge and silver, pretty for me, though I've to put these in the case of items I'm using. Great for my Olympus digital camera that eats lots of batteries."
5,The Definitive History of American Cycling,"Peter Nye has brilliantly captured the almost forgotten past of the Bicycle. From crazy invention to America's most popular sport (at the turn of the century), Nye shares the stories and experiences that vividly illustrate the evolution of bicycling. Today the sport is growing and the book captures the stout spirit of those with ""hearts of lions"" both past and present."
5,A Classic,"This book has to be one of the classic texts concerning the study of CIVPOL operations and stability operations.The editors have selected papers concerning the experiences of multiple stability operations from around the world both successful and unsuccessful. In addition these chapters are written from practitioners from numerous nations which helps avoid the usual myopic view that we tend to have here in the US. If there are and short comings with the book is the failure to address ""Order Operations"" such as those under taken by the MSU and SPUs and the problem of organized crime and banditry that has developed in many countries.This book is a must read for anyone interested in understanding CIVPOL operations."
3,Beware: This is an excerpt from another book!,"I bought this book along with another in the series to bridge my British Royal history knowledge gap. I also purchased The Lives of the Kings and Queens of England, Revised and Updated edited by Antonia Fraser and found the text in this book is identical to that volume. I think there are additional photos in this book, but it is not something completely new. If you have The Lives of the Kings and Queens of England, do not bother with this volume."
2,Very superficial piece of work,"This would be fine for a junior high school history assignment, but don't look for any detail beyond that level. The overall impression is one of superficiality, with not a great deal of attention paid to accuracy."
2,VERY POOR EDITING!,Don't bother with this. It's a total waste of money and time.Facts are wrong and useful information scarce.I consigned it to my local Goodwill store immediately.
5,Sophisticated concept album,"Ian Anderson's lyrics really shine in this cryptic but beautiful concept album, which is woven through with both religious imagery and bits of pop culture.A caution to the collector, however: the description above lists this edition of the album (regular Chrysalis CD release) as having 16 tracks, like the original LP. The CD is actually divided into only two tracks: sides A and B of the original LP. Thus, if you want to listen to just a single movement of this rock pseudo-symphony, you'll have to spring for the gold release."
1,Too Eccentric for My Taste,"Although I really love Tull and appreciate the other stream of consciousness albums, this one is a bit too eccentric for me. The interjection of the children's tale ""The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles"" right in the middle of this album totally breaks the mood, and I found it quite anoying. In addition, it gets rather soft at times, and hard to hear."
1,Silly and dull,"Pop Kulcher Review: I had a brief flirtation with Jethro Tull during my high school art-rock phase. That pretty much ended with my purchase of this record, a theatrical concept album with recurring lyrical and musical themes, all of which I've long since forgotten. It's packaged beautifully, with an authentic looking playbill tucked into the center, which is actually pretty cool -- that way you have something to look at while the music plays. Because, let's face it, while fans may rave about the depth and creativity of this album, it's BORING. Whoa, boy, is it boring. And silly. Of course, it takes a monumentally dorky album to make its predecessor, Thick as a Brick, seem hard-hitting, but, on that level, Passion Play is a rousing success."
4,A Bit Strange,"This is definately the strangest Tull album. Most people either love it or hate it. I think it is often brilliant. The only fault I can really find is that the album ends very lamely. The record is blasting ahead at full steam and then it just stops! It always leaves me going ""Where's the rest? That can't be it!"" However, up until the ending, it's great and I recommend it all the way."
5,Ian Andersons Best!,"I remember when this album first came out and I was totally blown away. Immediatly following Thick as a Brick, I was suprised that he could top it. Heavily critized by critics, Ian dropped this from his memoirs of colages and it saddened me. If you have enjoyed Jethro Tull and haven't heard A Passion Play, you haven't listened to the pinacle of his success. Don't wait until they pass away."
5,A musical peak,"Despite being a bit of a metal head over the years it has always amazed me how I return to this album for inspiration, such is it's quality. When you listen to it in it's entirity (whilst generally bouncing, preening and throwing the obligatary shapes) then you'll see what I mean.Of course, some may find it long-winded whilst others may not be able connect with A Passion Play's unique mood - fair enough. After all, hare did have a spare pair......."
5,Soundtrack to a great show,"I was fortunate enough to see the 1973 Passion Play concert tour.It was one of the top 5 performances I've ever seen. The groupplayed ""Passion Play"" to open the show, got a huge ovation at theconclusion, and then Ian said ""thank you so much, and now for oursecond number......"" and then they immediately launched into ""Thick as a Brick"" and played the entire piece as well. I'venever seen a group play 2 40 minute-plus songs to open a show before or since. The rest of the show consisted of ""Cross-eyedMary"", ""Aqualung"", ""Locomotive Breath"" and ""Wind Up"" was the encore song. I had great seats on the floor of the L.A. Forum,about 20 rows back. A rather enjoyable evening for 6.50 a ticket.Ian Anderson himself considers this Tull's finest album, need Isay more? All Tull fans should own this CD. Buy it and wear it out......"
4,like a surrealistic circus soundtrack,"Surely Tull's greatest album based on studio indulgences, and comes across like a passionate musical quilt of nifty jazz phrasings and circus music. Let the high-wire fly and the storyline put on a surreal mask. Then plug it into a far-too powerful outlet and hope for the best.The lyrics are slightly, and sometimes very vague, or perhaps just that the meanings are so far from being delived in prose that the storyline fails to be important since the musical bursts and hooks are delivered in a rapid fire method with incredible momentum.This solidifies into a musical and vocal thrill. It soars on some kind of musical high which is the essential thing the listener gets. Energy almost independent of the lyrics, the force of the music carries on like a musicians Ironman competition.The hare.......I agree......having fun is important !!!"
5,THE one to get,"This is so simple. If you enjoy APP, then find the Gold CD and search no more. It is the reference version. Buy, listen, enjoy."
5,Wonderful!,"This is a great album! And, before I say anything else, there's one subject I must brooch! The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles. I've seen way too many people rip on this piece. I love it! You have to understand its purpose. It's an intermission, to lighten the mood between the heavy music and meaningful lyrics. Yes, others have noted that, but they missed a point. Remember the title? A PASSION PLAY. Midievil passion plays could take a week to perform, and would always have a light-hearted interval, unconnected with the rest of the story. Almost exclusively dealing with a simple moral with animal characters. If you take that, and the obvious anti-establishment (for lack of a better term) satire involved, you'll get much more out of this story. (And by the way, Ian doesn't do the vocals for The Hare, Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond does.) The rest of the album's great, too, but any other review can tell you that. Check this piece out, it's worth it!"
2,the most important one is missing...,"this book is really well done, apart from the fact that there are a lot of covers shown from saul steinberg, but his MOST IMPORTANT one, the view from 9th ave westwards, is missing. this is a clear draw back of this book, and hence, since it's title is ""cutting-edge covers"", i think it only deseverves two stars."
2,Disappointing.,"Stone Age seems to have added techno-sound too much, which makes the whole tune less Celtic.The first album, 'Stone Age' is one of my favourite albums. Gaelic rap and reggae, bagpipe with transbeats, etc. So experimental, but this album seems stayed."
4,"A classy, fact-filled little book","This book is only about a hundred pages long, yet at times I found it really hard to get through. I think that's because this book is so dense with poetry and information and poetic prose. It's a very SUBSTANTIAL book--there's a lot to it, as there is to the areas the author describes.That said, she does an excellent job at describing complex geology in simple terms, at presenting new and surprising information on familiar subjects, and at developing a good perspective of the place--of the wild, desert Escalante River of southern Utah.I would recommend this to anyone interested in Glen Canyon, Lake Powell, the Escalante River, and Navajo Mountain...and especially to people who like poetry."
2,Undersized by two sizes!,"I ordered this for my child who wears a size 10-12. I ordered a large which was stated to be a 12-14. This costume was WAY too small. Due to time constraints, I had to cut a hole in it and he had to wear shorts over it. The large is comparable to an 8-10."
3,Funny business was done to 'Funny Lady'.,"I could not wait to hear this soundtrack on cd. I was impressed that the order was more true to the order of songs as they appeared in the film. My favorite song was always ""(It's Gonna Be A) Great Day"". Imagine my surprise when the original song (which was perfection) was replaced by an alternate version. This version sounds like a demo gone bad. It is just horrible! I would recommend that one get the lp version and transfer it to cd. What a truly disappointing experience. Pass on this 'funny' recording."
5,Funny Lady Soundtrack,"This was a favorite of mine in my 20s and I found myself humming some of it the other day. My record album is long gone and so I ordered this which arrived in just a few days, brand new, as advertised. Excellent transaction."
4,"Simple, exciting story","This is an excellent and exciting adventure for kids who are just starting to read chapter books (and moving beyond early readers like the Cat in the Hat.) In just a few short pages it manages to draw the reader into an exciting plot about a boy whose uncle sends him to pick up a mysterious package. When the boy returns, his uncle has been kidnapped. Inside the package is a plaster cat (rather like the Maltese Falcon), which is both the cause of the mysterious kidnapping and a clue to its solution. With his friend, the boy visits a sinister collector of these cats in town and find out what is at the bottom of this fishy business. This story is action-packed and full of memorable images; it is also illustrated by Quentin Blake. I remember reading it when I was in third grade, and I just tracked down another copy fifteen years later to enjoy again. It's not great literature but it's good fun."
3,Decent,This cd has good tracks but it's not that great of an album than what i expected when i decided to buy
4,Two Good Hits,"This CD is kind of vintage 60's British rock; I happen to like ""Well Respected Man,"" and ""All the Day and All the Night,"" but there are other hits on this CD, so you get your money's worth. I believe they are the original recordings (at least they are not live nor redone much later). You cannot buy ""Well Respected Man"" as a single, so this is your only way to get this song."
3,So so cd release.,"The music on this set rates 5 stars, but I have a hard time recommendingA cd that clocks in at a half hour. For a couple of bucks more you can get a better 'greatest hits' cd set."
5,Back to the Beginning,"This collection is pure early Kinks. They were at the beginning and were great. Not a lot of silliness here. Simple, straight ahead rock and lyrics that get under your skin. You can see why the punks were inspired by these tunes. I bought this for each of my now young adult kids so they could appreciate what was happening beyond the Beatles, The Rolling Stones and the Who. They smiled that ""Oh Dad another history lesson"" smile but then the cd stayed in their dashboard player. For weeks. Bitten again by the bug of ""Till the End of the Day,"" ""Set me Free,"" ""Tired of Waiting for You,"" ""All Day and All of the Night,"" and the unremitting, unrepentant ""You Really Got Me"" my copy stayed there too."
3,A bit different from the LP version I bought,"This was my first Kinks album, which I bought on vinyl in the early Eighties. But it had ""Lola"" on it in place of ""Don't You Fret"". It was great, for an LP. Slightly less great for a CD. Ten songs is far too few.I'd recommend it for nostalgia value only. If you want a great compilation for only about $12, get the Ultimate Collection. 2 CDs and lots more songs."
1,"Hilarious - ""Rare"" Nordic Plant",This product is not from the Nordic. Inquire with the company as to the origin of their herb . . . this company has NOTHING to do with Scandinavia or the Nordic.
5,Great job Queen Vera!,"Queen Vera happens to be my own mother in real life! I am so proud of her. She is a very talented and creative woman. She is a pioneer among women who has stepped into amazing feats without fear or reservation. She has never lost her beauty and others marvel at her exotic specialness. A true queen and a star that lights up the darkness with her amazing charm, class and presence. She has never ceased to amaze me with her wit, quick mindedness, great intuition and keen insight and internal compass that always had an amazing direction about her that caused you to know she knew how to step in where the band was playing and to reach for the brass ring and brighten the world around her. Soft as a mom, lovely as a woman, and amazing as an actress and free spirit."
4,A quietly internal revolution will turn your vision inside o,"Dr. Wright's book is a quiet revelation which led to an internal revolution for me. His careful definitions of abuse and what constitutes abuse are but the preludes to detailed and riveting stories of hurt and healing. As we watch the Roman Catholic churches wrestle with one form of abuse and the Israelis and Palestinians wrestle with another, such a definition is indispensable to our understanding of what faith and belief really mean. There could not be a timelier exploration of one of the central issues of our day -- finding spirituality that unites and heals instead of dividing and killing. Dr. Wright's book is a must-read!"
4,It's all good,"First CD of her's that I've heard/bought, so I really don't have any basis for a review, but I think it's good. The Enhanced CD part is about useless, though."
1,A nightmare,I retired as owner of a fabricating business and beleive me this is a nightmare to put together. The screws are at least a number four and almost impossible to work through three layers of about a 22 ga tissue thin aluminum stamping. I ordered a pop-rivet gun and riveted rather than screw the parts together. The metal is so thin that one might easily use two peices thinking there is only one. I could continue my complaints but I think I have made my point.
5,"Great Product, Reasonably Priced!","This quality product is great for keeping hot water on hand for making instant coffee, a cup of tea, a bowl of oatmeal or other hot cereal, and several other kitchen tasks that require hot water. I especially like the fact that you can keep your water temperature constant all day and that you can control the temperature by utilizing the three settings on the pot. GREAT PRODUCT!"
1,Mediocre book that needs documentation,This book sorely lacks sufficient documentation to support the writer's theories. Nothing new about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is offered. Nothing here to challenge the reader. Don't waste your money.
1,Very Disappointing,"This book begins on a breathtaking note but ends with such a big disappointment. The characters are well-defined, the plot engrossing, and the dialogue realistic and putantic. Doctor William Olund's murder at the beginning of chapter one grabs the reader immediately into the story but unfortunately the ending fails to deliver the promised punch. Very disappointing and predictable ending."
4,Better than OG Bobby Johnson,"This album is more complete than his last joint he put out.....This time around, he's teamed up with production team XING AND FOX, to deliver crazy beats unlike no other on this project......At first the production sounded way too weird for this album, but I feel it suit's the albums' purpose and compliments the name ""Spazmatic"".....THere were sum lacking tracks on here, like Booty with CHeese"" that track has too much going on in it, it becomes very repetitive, the album heats back up when it gets to ""My Melody"", THat and Da Musik"" are the highlights of this album......Their beatz on this album are very drug like, spacey, you know, if thats whats you're lookin to listen for.....Overall much, better than OG Bobby Johnson, not his best album tho, but one of his better ones in a long time......"
3,Unabridged??????,"My capacity to listen to cassette tapes went down the tubes when I recently got a new car. Consequently, I ordered this CD because one of my favorite ""Fresh Air"" interviews with Philip Roth (which I have on cassette tape) was on it. The CD is advertised as ""Audiobook, Unabridged"". It is not unabridged; the Roth interview was cut short by, at least, 25 minutes, and from my perspective, much of the good stuff was cut, and some of the less good stuff remained. I would also guess that other writers' interviews have been abridged, since most of Terry Gross' interviews are close to an hour long, and most of these are ca. 25 minutes. Too bad, because I don't think that any of her (usually wonderful) interviews should ever be cut."
1,Broken when received,"This was the type of product wanted but even though it was plastic, it had a huge crack in it when it was unpackrd. Returned the item to Amazon."
1,cracked,"Bought this item several months ago and have just had the occaision to use it. When I poured the fat from a boston butt into it, it cracked and started to leak on the bottom and sides. This could have been a very dangerous situation, had it broken into pieces. Anyone know where I can get one made from glass??"
2,Title is misleading,This product is posted as a Strainer as well as a Separator. It has no strainer of any kind. You would have to purchase a strainer if you prefer your gravy chunk free.Very misleading.
3,don't let the picture confuse you,"I misread description, and thought others may experience the same confusion. The bandages are cloth latex free with an acceptable adhesive.This package containsList No. 00330 1.5 in x 2 in rectangular patchesIt does not contain the other shapes. You can find the other shapes if you search ""coverlet"" followed by the list no.The list numbers are as follows:List No. 00340000 Patch 2 in x 3 inList No. 00801 Toe Shield 2.5 in x 1.375 inList No. 01306 Small Digit 2.125 in x 1.5 inList No. 01307 Large Digit 2 in x 2.5 inList No. 00385 4-wing 3 in x 3 inList No. 01390 knuckle 1.5 in x 3 inI hope this helps others who are searching for a specific shape."
4,"Astounding in bredth, a real treasure","This work features a mighty 328 philosophy authors and a main body of over 1250 pages. I have not yet come across a philosopher whom I wanted to read about and whose works were not represented in some form in this massive work. Hence it is one of the best places to start research on philosophical topics that I have found.What this book has in breadth is not found in depth. Most works in the book are excerpts, and while they help provide a brief intro to each philosopher's thoughts, they do not provide enough to really speak for themselves. Thus while it is a good place to start, in most cases it is not a work which provides a great deal of value in a vacuum.The index is of average quality, and this is one area where extra work would have been helpful in this sort of anthology.All in all, I would recommend this work."
3,"Hmmmm, better luck next time...","Love Letters is a great album. This one lacks passion and cohesion. It's okay, but the musicianship is no where near the Miles Davis Quintet of the late 50's etc. Either buy ""Love Letters"" by Roy Haynes, or get back to Miles and Parker. This one is a little flat..."
2,What's with the sound mix,"Is it just me, or was there no Steve Howe in the mix after the first couple songs. I saw the pay-per-view and noticed it to my utter frustration, and so bought the VHS hoping that the foul up would be fixed. It wasn't. How can you have this band playing these songs and have Steve Howe almost inaudible? It's inexcusable. I haven't seen/heard the DVD, but came here looking for some review alluding to the problem and hopefully a fix."
4,Does Amazon really have it?,"This DVD was unavailable for years and I ordered it weeks ago, but have not yet received it. Has it been listed as available by mistake???It's a very good show, but the sound of Bruford's electric drums make me wonder if he was brain damaged in the 80s."
4,The best live Yes I've seen,"If you are a guitarist who appreciates Steve Howe, this is worth having...if for no other reason, just to see him play Mood For a Day."
4,The best live Yes I've seen.,"If you are a guitarist who appreciates Steve Howe, this is worth having...if for no other reason, just to see him play Mood For a Day. DJFAKE's comments on the performance are right on target."
5,"If someone knows how to get one, please e-mail me.","I saw the original broadcast from Oceanview, CA, in 1989 with some friends (25) at my father's home and via satellite. My gratest musical experience without take in count the tours of 98 and 99. My VHS video was stolen 3 years ago and I need to get one, so please if you know someone or you want to sell it, please, send me an e-mail. In my opinion it's the best concert video in the history of VHS. Chris Squire was the great absent of the night, but the rest were excellent. Yes music like angels. I'm sure that if heaven have a soundtrack, Jon Anderson will be on vocals. Amazon, if you can get it, contact me soon as posible."
3,"Pretty, but impractical.","This cookie jar looks great with my kitchen decor, but the lid is so heavy and awkward to remove that I guess I will just use it for storage. The chimney, which I assume is supposed to be the handle, is so small and slippery that it just doesn't work. There is no way my children could open it without dropping and breaking the lid."
1,PAD IS WAY TOO HARD!,THIS IS A GREAT CONCEPT BUT THE PAD/SEAT IS SO HARD YOU MAY AS WELL KNEEL ON THE GROUND. THE LEGS/HANDLES HAVE NO PADDING AND IT IS UNCOMFORTABLE TO TRY TO GET UP. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT.
4,Great For Old Knees,"I have found this product to be everything I hoped. For extended gardening, I had previosly used a wheeled garden cart. As most of yard is sloped, I was uncerimoniuosly dumped on several occasions as the cart rolled out from under me. This can be particularly painful on paved surfaces. This product is allows me to get up and down more easily, and it is very stable. My only concern is how the cushions will hold up after time. The cushions are not upholstered, but seem to be of a high density foam. The surfaces appear washable, but the edges are open and may be hard to clean after a few uses."
1,The Worst English Translator of the Twentieth Century,"Whenever you see David Slavitt's name on a translation, look elsewhere. He's a third-rate poet who has made a career of destroying the great works of other poets. This translation is a good example of that. At various points he goes off on tangents, commenting--shallowly, I might add--on the contents of the poem he is supposed to be translating. You read things such as ""What is Ovid doing here with this boring passage?"" But it won't be a footnote, it will be inserted into the body of the poem. For this one, read Mandelbaum's translation. Stay away from Slavitt."
4,The precursor legacy review,This book is an ideal companion to the game. It helps you find all the 100 orbs and including the 101st orb that is usually missed in that mine cart scene near the end. Makes the game easier to play but also reveals spoilers.
2,Confusing. Not worth the money.,"I bought this guide because I thought it'll help with the game. However, I received a very short magazine-like book which had very short description of what to do. It does mention what to do, but left out a lot of description. It went from one thing to the other without filling in the gap in between the two different subjects. Overall, this guide left me searching all over the place and I've had to figure out most of the things by myself with the little clues the guide had to offer. Sure there are a few nice pictures to look and it slightly helpful but very very short description, but I wouldn't suggest purchasing this guide if you aren't very experienced with this game (like me). Its probably better to look for a walkthrough on the internet, even though it may be a little less convenient ."
1,Where are the maps?,"I recently purchased Prima's Official strategy guide for Jak and Daxter. I am extremely disappointed. For some reason unfathomable to me, the person putting together this book decided to leave out maps. Most people who use strategy guides just use the maps so if they get lost they can have some help getting unlost. They want to figure out the game for themselves. Instead of having helpful hints for when you get lost this book just includes step by step instructions. I might as well be reading a book on step by step instructions for setting a VCR, it would be just as much fun. It's not worth the price for a book that doesn't help anyone have fun."
1,Low Quality - could be better.,"Very disappointed in this guide because it uses low quailty paper instead of the high quaility glossy paper that produces clean, sharp photos of the game screens. Photos are low quality and many are useless because its hard to tell what is what. Also, there are no maps like in the ones in the Spyro series of guides. However, there some good tips in the text section of the guide. Great game but poor manual."
2,buy cheap,"Some guides are really helpful and necessary for finding and collecting everything in a game. This is not one of those guides. You'd expect better from Prima and you'd be disappointed. There are no maps and the discriptions are pretty vague.Fortunately, this guide can be easily found for under $7.99 at any local used bookstore or used media store."
5,Jan Howard,We just really enjoy her music. Were country music fans. Can't really say what they play today can be considered country.
5,Great for bike riding,I bought these in size 8.5 W. Been using these for bike riding every day for 3 years. I like the heavy shoe. Got them on sale for $28.49Be nice is they would go on sale again.
1,rating update,"Ordered them on July 19th they were in stock and on sale.I was supposed to recieve them in mid August.Then on August 29th I got an email saying the shipping was delayed and I had to confirm that I still wanted them.I did and the new shipping date is November 9th.Seems like a long time to ship an in stock item.REVIEW UPDATE:Item still shows in stock .They cancelled my order saying it is unavailable from their source.I believe it has something to do with the sale price I ordered it at has now tripled and they didn't want to honor the old price.I,ve bought a lot of things from amazon with good luck but this has left a very sour taste in my mouth about doing further buisiness wiyh them."
3,Underrated Chaney Vehicle,"One of Lon Chaney Jr.'s best horror vehicles, ""Man Made Monster"" (1941) holds up surprisingly well for a B-movie quickie. Clocking in at 59 minutes, the film benefits from Chaney's sympathetic portrayal of the electrically-charged ""Dynamo Dan."" Lionel Atwill lends effective ""mad doctor"" support and director George Waggner keeps the proceedings moving at a good clip. It's an underrated Universal chiller worth seeking out."
3,Classic 1940s horror/thriller,"Man Made Monster is an excellent example of Universal Studios' work during the 1940s. This neat little B picture has great mood and art design, some good special effects, and excellent performances by Lon Chaney Jr. in another of his sympathetic parts, and Lionel Atwill playing another of his (almost) over-the-top mad doctor roles. Highly recommended."
4,"""Dan McCormack, as you knew him, was doomed the first day he came into this laboratory.""","This UNIVERSAL Studios videotape is dubbed at SP speed from a well-preserved vault copy. It's full screen and has clean HiFi audio..Director George Waggner's 'B' grade programmer MAN MADE MONSTER has carnival sideshow man Dan McCormack (Chaney Jr.) lighting up like a neon sign after he receives from deranged scientist Dr. Rigas (Atwill) ""treatments"" of thousands of volts of electricity.In this pre-Wolf Mansci-fier, the second-billed Chaney plays a sympathetic monster to perfection. His success here led to Lon's casting in the role of a lifetime, that of tragic Larry Talbot...Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(6.3) Man Made Monster (1941) - Lionel Atwill/Lon Chaney Jr./Anne Nagel/Frank Albertson/Samuel S. Hinds"
3,Basic statistics book,This is a decent basic statistics book. Don't get it though if you are looking for college-level statistics information. I'd say this is more high school / elementary level.
1,not for beginners.......,"This book is not very user friendly. If you have troubles with math like me then this book is not for you. I would probably recommend a book like ""for dummies, or a schuam's at the beginnnig level then reread this book, and it will be a little clearer."
3,review,great seller the product is as decribed but beware one size fits all if your small as i am its going to be very big on you
2,This said it was one size,"It said it was one size fits all but my girl is only 5'4"" and not very big this would be good if she was 5'5"" at the tallest and maybe no more that 135 at most."
2,Hard to understand,Maybe it's just me but I find it difficult to understand the lyrics because of poor acoustics. The echo chamber effect makes it frustrating to listen to.
4,Great product in a pinch,"These work great, although make sure you realize there are only 3 in a pack, so you're paying a lot of money to brush your teeth. I keep these in my car but only using them sparingly."
3,you are not evan reeves,"Dear Michael Stark(if that's really your name), My mother may take issue with your statement. Do you think the folkie in Boulder is the only Evan Reeves in the entire world? I thank you for bringing him to my attention, though. Not bad for a debut album. Anyway, thanks for the identity crisis -- I'll be forwarding my shrink bills your way. Sincerely, EVAN REEVES._______Please remove your name from Google's search engine, as you are not Evan Reeves. Thanks you."
5,Transcends mainstream understandings of sexual violence,"Smith's groundbreaking book should be required reading for all rape crisis advocates in North America. Not only does she provide a scholarly examination of the link between colonial genocide and sexual violence, Smith also provides context for contemporary activism and solutions. Forget everything you thought you knew about rape and sexual abuse and be prepared to re-think what it means to be a feminist and advocate. Smith's eloquence and thoughtfulness make reading this text an ideal starting point for dialogue in both academia and grassroots organizations. You will learn about how historical events continue to have an impact today and how the mainstream (white) rape crisis movement has fallen short of providing comprehensive analysis of sexual violence."
1,A new standard in bad acting,"Is there a more unbearable actor playing a more insufferable character than David Caruso? He wouldn't be so unwatchable if I could believe he was camping it up to see how much fun he could have hamming it up, but I'm afraid he's serious...(Pause to put on sunglasses)...DEADLY serious."
1,Defective DVD,We enjoyed the Miami CSI series but were unable to watch the last two DVDs due to defects in the DVDs.
2,Not Good,"Horatio Caine is the most irritating character on TV. Glasses on. Spout aphorism. Cue music. Why won't he just GO AWAY?He's the Nancy Grace of the police procedural - more sensitive to victims, more caring, more solicitous than all the rest of us mere mortals AND he is also willing to ignore the law if he knows in his heart that THIS IS THE GUY.Not a sympathetic character. Not a good man."
5,CSI Miami the eighth season,I love CSI Miami the series is great love the characters and how their lives are tossed and turned in every way thanks Amazon for the opportunity to see this great series.
4,Decently strong Earl Grey tea,"The Celestial Seasonings Earl Grey tea is full bodied & fragrant. I enjoy fairly strong tea, & this will become strong if allowed to steep. However, the fragrance & freshness of the tea would probably be improved if the tea bags were individually wrapped."
1,Not compatible with mac osx,"This product says it is compatible with macs but is NOT compatible with OSX , in particular anything made in the last 5-6 years. It requires the 'classic os9' os which hasn't shipped in many many years. This company need to get off its tail and make some new software that is compatible and they need to stop falsely advertising this current software. Very lame that they keep selling 10 year old software.p.s. customer service never replies to email's .. big surprise there."
1,very outdated software,"I purchased this (and other) software because it was described as bring compatible with the mac OS. Unfortunately it is only compatible with mac OS 9. The last time that this OS was distributed was nine years ago. So the software is unusable on any current mac, which means that our household cannot use the software either.A waste of money that could have been avoided with a more accurate product description."
1,horrible,I'm running Windows 7 and it won't install because the software doesn't recognize anything beyond Windows XP. If I had known this I would never have ordered it!!
3,Not the best,"I thought I loved this, but it is very old school. No pun intended. The rabbit just doesn't cut it anymore, and I am finding it hard for my kids to navigate. Maybe time for an update?"
3,Won't install,I cannot really review this too much. It will not install on our computer (vista). We have tried a few times and cannot get it to work.
5,Stories of wit and realism by an impressive literary talent.,"Marian Coe has a native ability for writing stories that immediately hook the reader's attention and won't let go from first to last. Marvelous Secrets is a new anthology of her short stories filled with wit, realism, and memorable characters. Included are Local Color; All The Time There Is; Marvelous Secrets; Concessions; Homecoming; Bushes; Moon Lady; Waiting At The Matterhorn; Another Spring For Tulips; Gifts To be Delivered; The Healer; Pretty Is As Pretty Does; The Sentencing; Visit To A New Improved Jungle; Voices And Place; and excerpts from her novels ""Eve's Mountain"" and ""Legacy"". Marvelous Secrets is the perfect vehicle to introduce a major and impressive literary talent to a new generation of delighted readers."
4,A worthy read,"This debut novel from Walker Meade s not your typical mystery. The story has Dr. Forest Jamison returning to his small hometown in Indiana and reconnecting with some of the colorful characters of his past, including Miriam Dossel. Despite that she is now married with five sons, Jamison still has deep feelings for her. It is in trying to protect her from a heart-wrenching truth that he makes a decision that becomes increasingly painful to live with. Jamison, it seems, learns the hard way that not every decisions that feels right, is right, and that trying to protect a loved one from the truth is rarely a good answer, for the truth, painful as it may be, is what we all need in order to grow, and put life in perspective. This is a worthy read for anyone who has ever made decisions of the heart. In other words, everyone."
2,Disappointing,"Over the top and silly. I was a big fan of his first two books and recommended them to many people. There are just too many characters, too many places and, too many things happening that we just don't care about. The book is far too short to employ as many twists and characters as it did. Not his usual effort."
5,A Brisk Page Turner,"Bidulka had me at page 1 with the slanted spears of gilded sunshine piercing his office window - a peaceful image left in the dust when Russell Quant ends up traveling to Barcelona and nervously boarding (he's a prairie boy after all) a cruiseship in the hopes of identifying the person intent on killing his doozy of a client: wealthy, cynical, wildly inappropriate 80 year old Charity Wiser. Nothing is as it seems as Russell steams from Spain to Northern Africa to Italy, but the action and adventure follows him wherever he goes.The author writing style is unique, fast-paced yet rich in detail about the sights and smells and sounds of the fantastic locations, making it difficult to put the book down. The story ends all too soon and leaves you with a bit of a roller coaster feel - just when you thought it was over..."
1,Strap broke 1st day!,"The stap that COMES WITH THE CASE, is sewn on - and as I walked around the 1st day with my new camera in it - the little leather piece that held the strap to the case - broke away and the camera fell to the floor - luckily the camera did not breaK. CASIO DID NOT APPEAR VERY INMTERESTED WHEN I CALLED AND COMPLAINED!"
1,Disappointed,"This CD was recommended to me by a Hammond Organ site and I am very disappointed both in the quality of the recording as well as in the quality of the musicians. Perhaps there was a terrible mistake, but the CD I listened to is awful."
5,Four soulful and dynamic musicians,"This live music well represents the music industry and professional musicians of the world. It is soulful, grooving, sincere, and happy. Will rest your soul and make it swing."
4,Great Help,I recently bought this book through another book store and I love it....it makes the learning process sooooo much easier when you have the answers to compare with....it helps a lot.
3,flat out,"It's a fun game with demo durbys and just a fun game with cars, using dumbies as bowling balls to darts. Awsome and funny game."
4,A rootin tootin wild fun ride.,I baught this game shortly after I had rented it out because I saw the replay value being very high. This game is a good time waster and is very fun to play.
3,Its Ok,Came as described and sooner than it was supposed ! Most def will buy from this seller again ;)
4,History in Print,"In this day , and age this A top Historical Addition to to any Facts Collector , or Genealogical Necessity."
5,The Dragon Waiting--a classsic,"This is an excellent fantsy novel from my early years. It is well written, with rich historical detail and cutting suspense. The book I recieved was of good quality, and first edition paperback. I would recommend this book to anyone with a taste for historical novels and fantasy. Fans of Parke Godwin, Morgan Llewellyn and more recently Jim Butcher should enjoy this work."
3,For History Lovers Only,This book tells a complex story within a richly and well researched history. Don't expect your basic vampire/sorcerer horror tale. The references to the supernatural are minor to the story at hand. My one criticism is that the story sometimes gets a bit too convoluted.
5,What music's all about,"This guy's a gem! A great disc of roots rock. Reminds me of Tim Carroll, Tommy Womack, Lonesome Bob and to some degree, Robbie Fulks. A wicked sense of humour, and some nasty lyrics match his brand rock & roll twang. You don't hear enough guy's like this these days. This made my top five last year, and I like it even more today."
2,Misleading,"I love the Brambly Hedge books, but be forewarned that this book is simply a repackaging of Summer Story and Poppy's Babies, put together into a ""special gift edition."" I already own the two, so I've wasted my money."
4,Wonderful Resource,"This ""dictionary"" is a wonderful resource to have on the bookshelf. The only negative thing I have to say about this resource is that there are some important names missing. I suppose the editors could not include everyone who could have been included, so I understand. Overall, this is a great resource."
4,"Quality, Lightweight boot","Have only worn a couple times, but so far I like them.Pros:LightweightQuality-madeTrue to length and width.Overall they are comfortable (see Cons).Good support.Cons:No cushioning under foot. When I added liners, was too tight at the steel toe and crushed/rubbed on the tops of my toes. Had to cut off the toe part of the liners. Advise to buy one size larger in order to put liners in."
3,boots are VERY heavy,The boots are very well made of quality material. The sole seemed very supportive. They are extremely heavy compaired to other steel toe boots. Upon reading the other reviews I ordere a half size smaller than I usually wear and they were still larger than i wanted. Probably would have been ok with heavy socks and additional inserts.
2,painful to wear,"I bought this as my first pair of steel toe boots, but have worn many pairs of regular work boots before. I would not suggest these to anyone. I loved that they were all leather and they have held up well while working, but they always hurt my feet when I wear them. The back of the heel near my ankle has a seam between two fabrics, and this rubs on my ankle, leaving it bruised and swollen after only a few hours of wearing them. I gave them time to wear in, but after a few months they still bruise me every time. I tried wearing different or multiple pairs of socks, to no avail. They are not too small, so that's not the problem. If you're looking for comfort, don't get these. They also ran a half-size large. Normally I wear a size 9 shoe, but in this case the 8.5 fit the best."
4,good steel toe boots for women,it was difficult to find womens steel toe boots that didnt look or feel like clown shoes. these boots are great.
3,Working and alot of Walking,The boot was comfortable as long as you did not do a lot of walking. It made my ankles very sore.
3,Stilted -- maybe on purpose,"Sometimes a Shakespearean play is meant to be overacted, theatrical. It's a deliberate choice on the part of the production company, the director, someone. This version of Othello with Anthony Hopkins is of that genre. So too, Patrick Stewart's Macbeth.I keep trying to remember that, when Shakespeare wrote, he wrote for the common man. Today's elitist attitude toward Shakespeare only reflects how banal our tastes, today. So with that in mind, it makes sense that the 'traditional' way to display his plays, is to overact in them. Like the silent movies and Greek plays, all that excess pathos was designed to get through to the average citizen. And, maybe it does. Pas moi.Enunciation and diction in the play are good. Blocking, as expected. 'Amelia' was believable, as was 'Roderigo'; everyone else, way too stilted. I would like to think they were instructed to play stiffly. These are fine actors. Stifled."
4,queering straights,"Like the increased visibility and rush to study 'whiteness' in the wake of critical race theory's interventions, this edited collection proposes to make heterosexuality visible in the wake of queer theory. Applying queer theory to the contruction of heterosexuality in its many forms allows a break with the normative. The writers here thus work to make visible ""queer straights"" and further disrupt heteronormative institutions and discourse. While scattered among a broad array of subjects (from Seinfeld to Shakespeare), the papers work well together to show how queer theory can be usefully applied to the analysis of norming institutions and identities. Some may object to the claiming of a queer identity by ""straights,""; others will find that the authors make their case and do progressive work by extending the bounds of queerness."
5,Good Text for a Course,This is a beautiful book with careful drawings and magnificent color photographs. It is a serious scholarly work. An ideal text for a course on Oriental Carpets.
4,Buddha bar Specialist,Not as strong as the resthas on some great songsbut more lazy but u need to get itto have the songs missed on the other cdsStll u will be satisfiedand the price is great
2,Struggle to get through,"It is always disappointing when an author takes a fascinating subject and ruins it with his pseudo-intellectualism. It is not fun re-reading passages, trying to translate the convoluted wording that an author has chosen to obscure his work with. Mr. Cunningham has taken the fun out of his subject matter and made the reading of it a dreary chore."
5,"Very Underrated, however theatrical","I stumbled upon this album after a friend of mine got rid of his cassette collection. I gave up on Kate with ""Hounds of Love"" which I thought was pretty lifeless and dull. But what a fun and emotional revelation ""Lionheart"" turned out to be. You can feel the emotional impact of these songs, despite the oft-critized overproduction and the theatricality. But I don't mind the latter at all -- I like lush detailed production. There's no pretense here about being a rocker or having to use pointless drum machines or discordinance. BTW, I've listened to Laura Nyro's ""New York Tendaberry"" and I think Kate is the more interesting and fun listen (even if Nyro cuts closer to the bone)."
4,A Charmer,"Kate Bush's second record. Rushed out after the surprising success of ""The Kick Inside"" the arrangements are simpler than on any of her other records. She has expressed some reservations about the album,but sometimes its more direct liveliness is just right. Some great driving songs."
4,What ever happened to Kate!!,"This is by far my favourite of all kate's albums. her voice is fresh and melodic some thing to be treasured. her best song i think on this album is ""Symphony in Blue"" I cant wait to hear more from kate the Red Shoes is the best musical ever for any one who likes a darker sound yet in a classical sense buy Lionheart or if you are a fan of kates already buy the box set ""This Womans Work"""
2,A somewhat boring album.,"Fortunately, I was not a fan of Kate Bush at this time (I wasn't born yet, I was born a year later). ""Lionheart"", is as if many of the most boring tunes of ""The Kick Inside"" were compilated here. It didn't work for me as much as ""Kick"". Nevertheless, ""Lionheart"" has its excellent moments. The charming ""Oh England my Lionheart"", ""Kashka From Baghdad"", and the humorous ""Coffee Homeground"" indicated that not everything was lost in Kate. She was conscious that she could do better things. And fortunately fou us, she never returned to this low point again."
3,"Not as good as ""Kick Inside""","I think this album was still good and all, but it just didn't move me in the same way that the ""Kick inside"" did. Still songs like ""Wow"", ""Hammer Horror"", ""In search of peter pan"", and ""Don't push your foot on the heartbrake"" were very good."
3,PILLOW TALK,"When I converted my LPs and tapes into compact discs years ago, there were only a few I didn't want to keep and ""Lionheart"" was one of them. I since have replaced it and time has been kind to this luscious crop of super-feminine musical meanderings that seem just a heartbeat away from Lawrence Welk. After all this time however, I still don't 'get' ""Hammer Horror""."
5,Kate's Second Album,"Worth it just for Wow! and Oh England MY Lionheart, you'll love it if your a die-hard Kate fan like me. Must be the third or fourth time I've bought this Kate - any chance of an autograph? :-)"
5,This is my Favourite Kate Album,In a sentence this is a Life changing experience. It's just Unbelievable!!!...
2,A somewhat boring album.,"Fortunately, I was not a fan of Kate Bush at this time (I wasn't born yet, I was born a year later). ""Lionheart"", is as if many of the most boring tunes of ""The Kick Inside"" were compilated here. It didn't work for me as much as ""Kick"". Nevertheless, ""Lionheart"" has its excellent moments. The charming ""Oh England my Lionheart"", ""Kashka From Baghdad"", and the humorous ""Coffee Homeground"" indicated that not everything was lost in Kate. She was conscious that she could do better things, and certainly, she never returned to this low point again."
4,good first side,For me this is a notch above her debut (her weakest). i think the first side is a wonder and creates a magical mood - something very 'otherly' special about those tracks. Unfortuneately this is not quite sustained in the second half. From here on in her discography the number of weak tracks can be counted on one hand and that includes her b sides - she is just ridiculous really.
3,"The Kick Inside, Jr.","While I wouldn't technically call this a sophomore slump, it definitely falls short of her excellent debut, ""The Kick Inside"", and gives no inkling as to the greatness that would follow. One gets the feeling that this may have been rushed a bit, probably by the record company, in order to capitalize on her early success. The songs follow in much the same piano-driven mode as the first album but, while that one had nave charm to fall back upon in spades, this one suffers from the occasional overreach and misstep. The only songs that stand out, for me, are ""Symphony in Blue"", ""Wow"", and ""Hammer Horror"", with honorable mentions going to ""Fullhouse"" and ""Kashka from Baghdad"". Of course, if you're a budding Kate fan, this review won't matter because you're going to buy this anyway. And, you should, as a matter of fact, because it's worth having. It's just not her best."
5,Perfect for girls of all ages.,"My first grader is an advanced reader and thinker and she is a little bored now of the Magic Treehouse series. I came across this Franny K. Stein audio/book combo at my library. It is sooooo great. It has an original story line, no rude or mouthy bad-example characters, an independent and intelligent main character, and great art throughout the books. If you can snag an audio version, I recommend it for younger readers.Since starting the series, my almost 7 year-old has turned her doctor coat from the dress up bin into her LAB coat and has turned my laundry room into her lab. A bottle of vinegar, a box of baking soda and some kool-aid powder along with an empty notebook equal an hour of experimenting and documenting her results.Best book series we've read so far and we are only 3 books in."
5,Diann,"I ordered a copy of each books from this series for our school library. Now there is never one on the shelf, when one is returned it is quickly checked out again by another student. I have now ordered more copies. My daughters love the books. This one is sweet, it show's how Franny struggles to fit in and make friends. In the end she is accepted and loved for who she is."
2,E Digital doesn't honor warranty,The Odyssey 200 would have been a good value had it worked properly when I received it. The memory expansion slot was defective and fried a 32MB SmartMedia card that had been working fine in a Rio for 2 years. Tech support refused to acknowledge the unit was defective and refused to exchange it or give me a refund. Buyer beware -- the company is dishonest.
3,Not bad for a secondary title,"For being a second title Peter Parker The Spectular Spider-Man isn't that bad. The villains aren't really that great though, I mean Spider Man fights Ninjas for god sakes. The arc where Spider Man became the lizard is awful. The art is terrible and the pages are messy and unclear so its not even worth reading. Its not bad and the art is usually good but its diffidently a side book"
4,Bajans Shouldn't Read this Book in Public,"The more acquainted you are with the food rituals of West Indians (and Bajans in particular), the more you should restrain yourself from reading this book in public. You will grin, chuckle and gafaw, and people will stare at you."
5,Read it.,"Great characters, great story line, and best of all, a couple lines that I will probably never forget (and have managed to use a number of times in conversation): ""There is only one profession. Matador."""
3,If only...,"I gave this book three stars, and I thought is was well written, but I would have given it two, or less, if this hadn't been the case. What I mean is that the plot was simply atrocious, I spent a vary large portion of this story hoping against hope that there would be a plot twist, and the obvious solution would not come to pass... alas this was a vain hope, and while I will give the author another chance, on he strength of the writing, I cannot recommend this title."
3,"Interesting story, obvious conclusion","The author continues the recent trend in police procedurals of whatever nation to flesh out the personal lives of the several police personnel involved, not just the chief protagonist. This grounds the story and makes it more believable. But is there anyone who doesn't figure out ""who dunnit"" before the first third of the book is over? I hope to read some of Nesser's other books to see if the conclusion is always so obvious--I understand it isn't--so will give him another chance. But still, a good read."
3,Interesting twist but a bit simple,"Think I'll try at least one of the more highly rated books. Enjoyed this as good ""in the tradition"", when you want something interesting to read that doesn't Consume you!"
2,Barely readable!,"An ax-man is in action killing 3 men in a small town. The Van-person who is holidaying nearby is brought in to solve the issue, what follows is a confusion of names and events that meander here and there without serving any purpose. Think the book should be calledBORE man's Point!"
3,Obvious,"Well written, but the identity of the killer is pretty obvious. In fact, there's only one real possibility. Barely a mystery."
2,Lazy Detectives,"Slow story (boring, actually). The laziest detectives I have run across. No modern forensic science used in the story--I guess that means the authors are too lazy to learn about it. Half way through the book, I started skipping. Try Asa Larrson or Steig Larrson for better stories. This author was recommended from a recent article in The Economist--another reason to give up on that magazine."
1,disappointing,I Will not be reading any more books in this series. The characters were bland and the plot hard to believe.
2,slow read,"Ordered several books by this author.Based on reviews.I found the books, slow, mild plots. More involved with the inspectors drinking and chess.For the first time, I will be returning books I ordered."
3,The author beguiles the mind,"In this well-reviewed mystery, Nesser introduces an inspector of solid character and an acute intellectual presence. Yet, the plot does not fit the denoument--there is just a bit too much slipperiness between clues held back and the final solution. The character and the evocative writing are enough for me to try another one, though."
4,Wish Me Luck,"Reviewer: Middleschool studentWish Me Luck by James Heneghan.Jamie lives in Liverpool during World War 2. During the first year of the war there were no air-raids or nothing, so kids and adults started ignoring the war, until one night when the war struck to close to home. Jamie&#65533;s parents decided to send him to Canada on a boat along with the new kid, Beeker.On the boat a Navy escort for protection followed them from the U-boats. When the Navy Escort left, Jamie and Bleeker knew they were in danger. That night the boat was bombed, and Jamie and Bleeker were in for the most horrible night of their lives.Exciting and suspenseful. James Heneghan&#65533;s creative writing makes you feel like your there. I recommend this book to eight graders and up because it&#65533;s a little hard to understand sometimes and has bad language."
2,Good Plot But Needing a Bit More Finishing,"I thought the story of the book was really quite good but it definitely needed something more. More than likely, some editing. Also, it felt like he was trying to rush everything. I think he could have probably made this a 400 page novel instead of a 200 page kid's book."
2,Such a Whiner!,I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this book. I am just on page 23 and already Lynn has gotten on my nerves so bad with her constant whining and feeling sorry for herself. I probably will not finish this book.
4,Wonderful comfort,"We lost our wonderful dog, Jasmine, just a few weeks ago. I've always believed that God created animals with the intention that they be eternal creatures, but ""Will I See Fido in Heaven"" conveniently listed the scriptures to prove it.My only complaint with this book is that it heavily quotes from the 'extra' books from the Catholic Bible, which the vast majority of Bible scholars agree are not part of the Bible.It does beautifully explain that since animals do not have a sin issue of their own that they do go to heaven, unlike humans, who must deal with their sin issue by admitting it exists and acknowledging that Jesus died because of it to cover our sins and gives anyone who asks access to His gift."
4,"Now thats ""good news""!!","I wish I can say I can fully accept the Christain faith, it is good to know that my pets and all the innocent creatures won't have to suffer because of my confusion. Thanks Mary Buddemeyer-Portor for the peace of mind you provided me for your well written book, I may not make it to heaven, but its good to know my animal friends will!"
4,Will I see Fido in Heaven,"My dad is a Pentecostal, I am a Lutheran (MS) He goes by what he is told the Bible says. He is told that only people can go to Heaven.This has been an on - going dispute with him. With this book, I now have scripture to back up what was in my heart all along..Yes, the book gives you scripture and goes one step more by explaining how the fall (sin) of Adam (man) effected the animals as well.After the fall, man became with sin, but the animals are not. Therefore , they dont need to accept Christ as their savior by word, faith ect. Because they are free of sin and automatically know about Jesus and God ie; the trinity,(get the book) when they pass over, they pass right on into heaven as we do.This book will make me a winner in this on going debate with Dad."
1,preachy,I did not find this book helpful after the loss of two of my best furry friends. It was preachy and most of the book was quotes from the bible and the authors interpretation.
3,A good read,"Well written but disjointed book. However, it gives one an accurate view into how one moves up in politics. The book will be of particular interest to those who lived in Chicago in the 40s and 50s."
5,If you like Metal you will Love this!..Buy it now!..,"This is by far the Razors best record! This album has far more diversity then the their previous releases hitting you in the face from all angles! Don't get me wrong though all their albums are KILLA! But ""Where we come From"" proves once again that ""Pissing Razors"" are true heavy weights of the underground metal scene! If you have seen this band live then you know how tight & techinical they are, but they truly take it to a even higher level this time around. So support ""TRUE METAL"" & get a record that doesn't have lame samples or people wearing masks trying to be scary! LONG-LIVE-THE RAZORS!"
5,Pissing Razor's best,"Bands like Pissing Razors and Skinlab are what real metal is all about. This is their strongest release, but yet, none of their albums are weak."
3,Hardcore Texas Metal,"These guys should called Pantera Jr. Let's see; they're from Texas, have brutal songs with titles like ""Justice Denied"" and have a singer that sounds uncannily like Phil Anselmo. Besides that, this isn't half bad stuff for old school metal. ""Burning Bridges"" and the ripping ""Opportunidad"" rival Pantera's no frills stomping, with plenty of heavy riffs. The song topics here are pretty in your face; from slavery ""Born To Serve"", to religious payback ""Vengeance Is Mine."" Without the obvious comparisons to the above band, Pissing Razors do their best to carry the torch for power metal in your car stereo."
3,Getting more technical,"With their new singer (Jason Bragg) Pissing Razors hasn't missed a beat in the vocals department. Instrumentally the band has taken more of a turn to the progressive side (sometimes sounding like early Metallica). Certainly there are some that can listen to technical stuff all day. But there's too much disjointed, odd tempo rythum stuff for MY tastes. I miss the hooky, straight forward, in your face grooves that they had on previous albums. The best time they captured it on this CD is on a part that starts at 1:32 of track 7. Don't get me wrong; I like technical stuff. They just need to mix it up with the straight ahead stuff."
2,Short life,"I purchased this thermometer from my local Walmart and it worked well, for about a year, but I only used it infrequently when cooking larger cuts of meats on holidays. The probe was easy to clean and I believe it was accurate, until suddently it registerd HI when I inserted the probe into uncooked meat. I tried ""rebooting"" by replacing the battery but the screen never changed. I'm currently researching what different brand to buy next for replacement."
2,Worked for about a week,"While it worked, it was awesome. Very handy.Now the temperature reading is off by like 40 degrees."
2,Not worth the money,"This thermometer died after a month. We suspect that some liquid got into the temperature probe. It's not really water resistant.It comes with a magnet on the back for putting it on a refrigerator, but it's not strong enough for us to feel safe doing that.It doesn't have a timer function, just a temperature alert function.Not worth the money."
3,Very basic,"The instructions are printed at the back of the package. Which I cut to get to the product. There were no batteries included. Item is a little bulky. Works fine though, although I'd probably buy a different one if this one broke"
2,Not Original Recordings,"Listen to the samples, these are poorly reproduced copies. Electronic music especially is extremely hard to reproduce exact ""voices"" for the notes."
3,A little short,The item arrived in a prompt fashion and the fencing was a good quality. My problem is the roll was not 25 ft long. After cutting three 5-ft sections I only had 6 ft of fence left. I did not measure before the first cut so there is nothing I can do now and luckily I didn't need a full 25 ft. This translates to almost 20% of the product missing (21 ft out of 25).
2,Didn't work like the video for me,I have been wanting a lettuce chopper (Mezzula) for some time so I like the video. When I used it and my lettuce was slightly damp it did not chop the lettuce well at all and mushed it instead. I ended up returning it
3,Lacking the Hardware?,"Building cars and racers is a great deal of fun, I grew up with legos so this was my favorite part. The race itself is a bit on the slow side, good for those 5 year olds and a welcome change over some races which are way too fast. My primary complaint is that you essentially need the Controller Pak or equivilent or all the work you put into your car is lost, so consider that an added cost and sneeky nintendo trick."
3,Alright Overall.,"The only thing I dislike about this game is that the course variety is very small. The graphics are alright, although quite good for how old this game is. It is pretty fun otherwise."
1,The box is more fun than the game,"This looked like a fun game and for 20 bucks I figured it would be worth it. WRONG. Our kids were confused and frustrated by the rigid limitations on racing and building cars and my dear wife, who is always up for a good driving game, didn't even bother to hide her lack of enthusiasm for this game from the young ones.This game is impossibly anal retentive. The instruction book reads like the manual for a furnace. If you are a big LEGO fan, I can't imagine this game will be anything but disappointing. Ditto if you are a racing game fan. Your money would be better spent on a real LEGO set.This game lasted about an hour, then it was back to the repetitive, but far zippier, Star Wars Episode I Pod Racer game."
1,Weird Side Effects,I experienced some strange side effects such as dizziness and nausea. I don't think this is safe for me. I use Yogi's Moon Cycle tea and that works wonders for me now.
5,"No brainer, Top quality",Love these tapes. MiniDV is the best picture quality and TDK tapes have always worked for me. I am on my 48th tape of home movies.
5,Beneficial Book,This book was very beneficial to the graduate class that I participated in during the summer semester.
4,Grace and Mercy...,"In the book ""Looking Back Between The Cracks"", Verna shares her personal testimony of how God saved her in spite of her situation.From her story we learn that God truly loves each of us and he wants all of us the believers and unbelievers to come to him just as we are. She lends encouragement to her readers that ""With God All Things are possible"" Matthew 19:26.I would personally recommend this book to anyone who may need reassurance that Gods Grace and Mercy is sufficient."
2,Dont buy it used,"I purchased this game used to added to my steam account, but what I found out after typing the key is that it has been used, omg! the original owner didn't reset the key on steam, another useless game."
1,BUGGY,"This game is full of bugs, and definitely not worth purchasing at this time. My roommate and I both purchased copies on release day, and we both ran into several problems, not always the same.- Finding and copying the proper .dll's to a directory- 10-15 minute load times (or freeze up) on multiplayer maps.- Sound and lag issues in Single player- This game uses Steam, and sometimes it wants to update the entire game (10 Gig)Wait a few weeks, see what Ubisoft fixes, then check the forums to see if it is really worth it. I just wasted 100 bucks for 2 copies of an incomplete game... please save your money and don't do the same."
1,Stunningly Bad First Novel,"Ugh. Is there anything more painful than reading this book? I doubt it. Isenberg is determined to traipse a long parade of characters before us in the first 50 pages -- all of whom have been given only superficial descriptions, and only some of whom play any real role in the so-called story. All we really find out about any of them is that they ""look great"" or were dressed better than the novel's heroine.Do yourself a favor and avoid this trainwreck."
5,our gang book,very interesting for the fans and it makes you feel like you are enjoying the time of the innocence and nostalgia
5,CSI tenth season,"I love CSI and love that Amazon can get me the new seasons before Australia even releases them that is why I love Amazon so much, thanks"
5,A Nice New Route At A Longtime Series,"Like with the last two season of X-files CSI Las Vegas gave us a decent new character after longtime actor who played Grissom left the show and that was Laurence Fishburne's character Dr.Langston which I felt rejuvenated the series a lot after it seemed to slow down after season 7. The last two season we've had with Dr.Langston were enjoyable to see especially with the two story arcs they made for him, but sadly it looks like Mr.Fishburne isn't coming back for the twelfth season which is a real letdown for me. While I enjoyed the season 9 through 11 I will miss the character of Langston, and while we'll have the rest of the cast that doesn't really feel me with much hope that it's going to bring their ratings up."
4,Pretty good,The DVD came earlier then I thought it would. Part of it was a little damaged but that is what a case is for. Overall good because even the price was good.
5,LOVE,I am a CSI fanatic! I have almost seen every episode. Having it on DVD lets me watch it when ever I want. It was a great price and came fast.
5,C.S.I THE TENTH SEASON,THIS IS GREAT.I LOVE IT TIMING WAS GREAT. YOU ARE GETTING BETTER ON EVERY THING. I HAVE ALL OF THE CSI. THIS WILL HELP IN GETTING IT BEFORE THE NEXIT SEASON STARTS THANK YOU....... C.S.I ROCK.........
3,Not Impressed with L. Fishbourne.,New lead sucks. Should of made Katherine in Charge and brought GAry back. Seller good.
2,Imperfection on disc,"The product is ok, But there is a nice scratch on disc #7.This does not please me at all. I have been collecting the entire series and this is the first flaw I've found. All the other (1 thru 9) were purchased at Wal-mart and all were satisfactory."
2,Introduction to Psychedelic Music for 10 year olds!!,"As an introductory book to psychedelic music this is a less than satisfactory book and it is definitely not the tome it pretends to be. The book focuses on fifty of the most important psychedelic groups, has some colour reprints of some classic albums and includes a list of the best psychedelic albums and singles. However, it is written in a very poor way, its overall presentation is shoddy and, very often, merely states the obvious without adding anything new. The writer's tendency to refer to his own record collection is, to say the least, annoying. For a really in depth analysis of psychedelia, I would recommend THE ACID TRIP (V.Joynson), FUZZ ACID & FLOWERS (V.Joynson) or even UNKNOWN LEGENDS OF ROCK AND ROLL (R.Unterberger)."
2,"Great scent, very odd flavor","And I don't mean odd in a good way. The scent of this tea is heavenly, and you can detect the vanilla and maple. But the tea tastes sickingly sweet without being sweet. The first time I put a little honey in the tea, and it tasted like I soaked it in honey. The next time, I left it as is, and it still tasted like it was soaked in syrup without all the sugar. Of course, I don't want to say you won't like it, but just saying it's not everyone's thing. My fiance doesn't care for it much either, but he tolerates it better than I do.I think the best way to have this tea is as a diluted iced tea, if you do end up purchasing it and not liking it. The flavor isn't so strong, and the coldness doesn't bring out the taste of the tea so much."
4,Strong tea with good taste,I am not a coffee drinker so I would probably prefer a similar tea without the chicory.
1,Not quite what I expected,Not that good really. It takes two teabags steeped for over 6 minutes to get any flavor and even then it is rather watered down. Would not purchase this again.
5,This book is alive!,"As a chiropractor I have a great interest in that which brings peace, more joy and freedom into anyone's life. In reading Carolyn Hobb's book, 'Joy, No Matter What', she condensed what I have been trying to communicate for some 28 years. This book is alive! One gets the sense that Ms. Hobbs has experieced completely what she is writing about and holds nothing back in communicating her deepest truths. If you are interested in playing full out in life, holding nothing back, this book is a must read."
3,Porn History,"I bought this expecting a little piece of history and documentary about an obscure TV show in NY City. What I got was a very small piece of broadcasting history about a very vulgar and selfish man whom my Grandfather might have arrested way back in the day when he was one of NY's finest.I'm all for freedom of speech, and I'm glad things like this could be made. However, just b/c it can be made doesn't mean I have to enjoy it. I'll keep it around just for my archives, but I doubt I'll ever watch it again."
5,La Victoria está en Tí,"Si quieres conocer la Víctoria conoce primero al Señor Víctory, este libro te impregnará con esa radiación de una manera muy especial. Sentirás su poder en cada palabra y te armarás de valor para triunfar en cualquiera de tus empeños. No aceptes la derrota, invoca la Víctoria ya que ésta te espera en los brazos de Víctory."
2,"A soft, soft, soft 'Trick record (over) produced by L.O.L. Producer Ritchie Zito, and badly, too!","Not much difference between thisversion and the stateside LP. Toomuch Tom Petersson, which has wrec-ked several of this once great bandsprojects. These guys were doing finewith Jon B. Brant (re-listen to TheDoctor (***.5 stars), Standing OnThe Edge (****), Next Position Please(****) or One On One (also ***.5)!Only good efforts since His Dagmarnessgot recycled have been: Cheap Trick('97), and Rcokford, but even thatis flawed by too much 'familiarity'.Back and Blue and Wherever Would I Beare very good. The rest except for IfYou Need Me and Can't Stop Fallin' intoLove are weak. It sounds like the'Tricksters COVERING themselves! Bringback Brant, please!"
4,Grateful Dawg,"If you likes The Grateful Dead and if you like bluegrass, then this is something you have to have."
3,None of the noodling you get with The Dead...,"This is the soundtrack to the documentary that came out a few years ago. These two very hairy guys play really well off each other, none of the noodling you get with The Dead. However, due to my own personal taste, I didn't take to this album because it leans more toward folk & bluegrass rather than jazz, rock or blues. Much of it is public domain material along with a cover of Friend of the Devil (is it still considered a cover when they do a Dead song?)."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype...,"Perhaps this series gets better as it goes on, but I found this book to be a bit too charming for it own good. Perhaps, it's aimed at teenage female fantasy readers, but not my cup of tea. Not enough action and too mannered for this fantasy reader."
2,Romancing the Dragon,"If you enjoy reading to escape to a safe new world where not a lot goes on, this book is for you. Ms. Novik wonderfully portrays a believable alternate history with dragons; unfortunately she forgets to create any real sense of drama in her world. She spends most of the book describing the world and showing how England is preparing the dragons to defend against the big evasion by Napoleon. When the battle does come it is more of an afterthought. I would categorize this story more in the line of a romance novel (a love affair between a man and his dragon), than an adventure novel. I know there are 2 other novels in the series, but I don't know if I will read them. I like a little more meat and substance to my novels."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,I wasnt crazy about this book. It might have been because I am not terribly interested in the flavor of this era. But mostly I think its that there wasn't enough action. I mean a book about a dragon warrior should have alot more happening than this does. In the entire book there are maybe 3 or 4 action scenes and the rest is a bit dry. Still it read fairly fast and it had promise. Maybe the other 2 books in this series will be better.
2,Bodice-ripping Dragon Bro-mance,"Reading more like a ""historical romance"" than anything else, _His Majesty's Dragon_ misses the mark on several levels. From the author's sparse writing style, to shallow characterizations, to weak world-building this novel is closer to a bodice ripper for man/dragon fetishists than an enjoyable read for alternate history fans. Avoid."
2,Shes no McCafferty,"Its been a while since I've read fantasy (used to 24/7 it seemed) but someone who knew my interest in alternative histories thought I might like this. Well, at first I did, even tho the main character was arrogant and boring. But then it became a long drawn out description of the trainings, and of the relationship between the captain and his dragon. The fact that he called him 'my dear' and gave him trinkets and jewels to please him, and coddled him like a pet gave me a very uncomfortable feeling. Theres even one scene where the dragon is discovering puberty, a scene I really didn't need to visualize. This isn't like any dragon I ever read about. Its not until the final third that anything actually happens, and then its just more of the same. Nothing really happens in this book, there are no interesting premises of how dragons would have changed the battle. Just wooden characters, and spoiled simpering dragons. Think I'll go reread my old McCafferty paperbacks as a remedy."
4,Alternative history fantasy well worth the read,"Temeraire is a very enjoyable fantasy. This is something that I hadn't expected to write about this novel. I got pretty overdosed with fantasy dragons a few years back and haven't read many books where they are main characters since. However, this novel surprises with the nice writing tone of the author. The characters are attractive without being derivative of other successful fantasy dragon series. In fact, setting the novels in an alternative universe, but one that is close enough to our own to have recognisable historical events, with the twist of being inhabited also by intelligent dragons is very clever.Don't avoid this novel because of the dragons - if like myself - you'd had enough of that particular fantasy cliché. It's the opening to a very enjoyable read that certainly makes me want to read book 2 in the series."
4,Inserting dragon corps into historical situations,His Majesty's Dragon (vs. His Majesty's Ship) combines the Napoleonic Wars with an established air corps of dragons. It's a stellar first novel; the language seems appropriate for the time and the characters of the protagonists develop through the novel. Can't wait to read the next in the series.
3,Looked good,"This book looked good, but I just never got into it. I have a thing with books though if they dont suck me in right away I have a hard time reading. It could be a great book."
5,Good Freebie,"i enjoyed this freebie book and am considering buying the sequel if i am unable to find a copy at the library. i'm fairly cheap, so that's high compliment."
4,Seems short - read over half in first sitting!,This book is apparently almost 400 pages in print. I got it on Kindle. I forced myself to put it down after reading 54% of the book straight from the first page. Either this book is a REALLY enjoyable read or it's actually pretty short! I took a star away only because I am sorry I only have 46% left to read.
4,An Enjoyable Historical Novel of War and Dragons,"The author takes advantage of the creative freedom allowed when incorporating talking dragons into an historical novel. She develops an intelligent, loyal dragon as one of the main characters along with his captain. These two become the center of the story that portrays the Napoleonic Wars from the British perspective.I enjoyed the tone and pace of the book and especially the writing about the dragons. The story is less than gripping or compelling but is certainly enjoyable.This isn't a genre that I would have picked up on my own. I read it since it was a free kindle download. I think it was well worth the effort. If I continue reading the series, I will do so because of the excellent character development of the dragon Temeraire and his relationship to the captain. I would hope for more intriguing action in future books."
5,Suprisingly Awesome,"I ordered this when I ordered my Kindle 2. I wanted something to test out the Kindle, to see if I like it or not. The book was in science fiction and has dragons in it. The book download was free. I really could not get screwed in the deal. I was not expecting much because I believe in the ""You get what you pay for"" theory. The other theory was, read the first book for free to hook you in for the rest. It worked. I am over half way though, and I have all intentions of ordering the next book. This book is really good and very interesting. With a majority of the reviews at 5 stars, it must be a good book."
4,Great Take on the Dragon Mythos,"I grabbed this free kindle title for my iPhone just in case. Boy did it come in handy and I was happily surprised.I started reading it waiting to pick up my kids and ended up finishing it that same night.Very entertaining, extremely good development of the dragons and their interaction with humans. My only complaint is the people are a little shallow, but it was still a very good read.Now, I just hope the rest of the series is as good."
4,A very good read.,I found this to be a great break from the repetative magic/elves/swords scene and a very interesting setting. All I can say is that I will deffinitely be reading more from Novik and I suggest you give her a chance as well.
3,"Decent, but not great","The book is mild, somewhat dull, and over-laden with sappy dragon-aviator love. ""You're the best dragon, I'd trade you for nothing"". ""No, you're the best aviator, I'd do anything for you"". I'd suggest the author cut nearly a third of the book in the editing room, and re-release."
3,"A Little Boring, But Free","It gets a little weird and boring more than halfway through, but the first half is really good and it's free, so what the heck, download it."
1,pretty dismal,"Being a passionate fan of both Lord of the Rings and the Patrick O'Brian novels, I thought this might be a fun romp. What a disappointment. I honestly thought it was for adults, but this is actually young adult or pre-teen fiction. To compare it to Patrick O'Brian is scandalous. For young people it will serve fine as something to stick in their duffle to take off to summer camp. I honestly can't imagine an adult enjoying this, but apparently many have. Wonders never cease."
1,Biggles disguised as a dragon pilot.,If the subject happened to be an airplane instead of a dragon the worthlessnes of this story would become immediately clear. Dull poor writing. No plot whatsoever. No real characters. Childish dialogue. All those enthusiastic reviews look a little fishy to me.
1,painfully poorly written,"I really was not impressed with this story. It tends to jump around, the conversations are not realistic. I sometimes have to wonder if the characters ever took a breath do to the lack of breaks or description during conversations. The basic concept of the story makes a vague attempt at being unique in the Dragon Riders of Pern have crash landed on Britain sense. Over all I found it to be cliche and was so glad I did not actually spend money on it. Perhaps if you liked a series like the Dragons of Pern this might appeal to you. If you want a well thought out plot with smooth story telling and characters that actually have some depth to them, this book is probably not for you. How it got a high rating I have not a clue."
2,Weak on facts,"The concept was good. I looked forward to the book. I am an avid reader of O'Brien, Forester, Pope, Kent and the others who wrote authoritatively about the sea war in the period 1776-1820. These were novels, but carefully researched and accurate. Also, I have built a 15"" long fully rigged wooden model of a sister of the Surprise. The author made several mistakes in ship architecture, handling, and in the tables of organization. To me, not even a solid amateur in this area (I had to stop and research), this detracted from the neat personalities of the dragons and their riders."
1,BAD,"According to the review, all this book is is a copy of Eragon with a little British theme thrown in. Even the staling of the egg mirrors Eragon. I would never buy this book, ever. Anybody who is reading this, definitly spend the extra $10.00 for Eragon. It is way better."
5,"Napoleon, Naval Officers, Dragons, Oh my!","Here is a book where you start off at the high seas after a massive battle between a French battle ship and a British battle ship in the height of the Napoleon Wars. Captain Will Laurence's career draws to a close as a Naval Officer when the dragon's egg aboard the French ship takes a liking to him. From there, we are thrust into an England and a world where dragons are rampant.The battles are stunning, the characters are not flat, and the story draws you in. What more could you want? And there are dragons. Temeraire gives Saphira a run for her money."
3,Well crafted story and flat characters,"I can't give a bad review to any story handled with such competence, but I can't give a good review to the same story if the characters are this one-dimensional and naive. The historical context & research coupled with the dragons themselves carry the book. Ms Novik is a talented writer in terms of structure and pace, but the human characters are shallow afterthoughts compared to their dragon counterparts. I would suggest this for younger readers looking for a straightforward story with happy endings and predictable plot lines."
4,An original spin on alternate history.,"""His Majesty's Dragon"" is an exciting tale set in the era of Napoleon. While this is a period of time that has been written about by numerous authors, Naomi Novik has emerged from this setting with a very unique and entertaining story.The story surrounds events and circumstances of Captain Will Laurence, after he wins a dragon's egg in a naval battle with a French frigate. Capt Laurence's life is drastically changed when the egg hatches and the dragon almost immediately bonds to him. The growing relationship between the dragon, Tremeraire, and Capt Laurence is the backbone of the story.""His Majesty's Dragon"" is a very interesting and fascinating read. It has been a while since I have encountered a story as original as this. Anyone interested in an original and entertaining story should pick up ""His Majesty's Dragon"" right away."
2,Why do people like this book so much?,"The character development is poor. And the relationship between the main character and the dragon is weird. Is it brotherly love, a father-son relationship? It reads more like a romantic relationship. The author doesn't do a good job of creating a world that makes sense. Really -- talking dragons? And we just use them like airplanes? We cant think of any other use for them? Come on. Boring...."
4,A pleasurable break from the magic of high fantasy,"There are many poignant reviews of this book, so I'll keep this brief.This novel refreshingly stepped away from the magic that steers most contemporary fantasy. I'd honestly consider this novel more alternate history imbued with elements of fantasy; namely the inclusion of dragons as a military force during a period of the Napoleonic Wars.If that premise sounds good to you, do yourself a favor and read through this book."
5,Temeraire enthralled me!,"Novik's world is awesome. Having just finished LIFE OF PI and a recent translation of ""DON QUIXOTE"", I was a bit worried that Novik's writing was simplistic at first. Ha, by the third page I couldn't put it down! Wow... Tall ships, the excitement and history of the Napoleonic era, dragon husbandry, and even an excerpt from Sir Edwards's book on dragon breeds explained so eloquently. :)I read this book in two days while on vacation and ran right out to four bookstores to find and buy the 2nd and 3rd installment! The cover art is also spectacular!This book made me remember why I have loved fantasy my entire life. Anyone who loves animals, and loves history will love these books. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. This series is a keeper. The most innovative use of dragons I've ever enjoyed.And, for once, the other author's blurbs on the cover were TRUE! I was not disappointed. Keep the history/fantasy coming Ms. Novik with or without Temeraire I will read your next novel."
3,Easy & Simple Read,"Ok I love Fantasy books, but, this one fell a little short for me. Sorry... I have to say that I agree with most of the reviews, but, it was a little slow in parts & I found myself skimming alot. It is definately one I would recommend for a kid's book. It was entertaining & well thought out but not quite a deep enough story for adults."
5,Masterful Character Writing,"Probably don't need another 5 star review to read this book, but here goes anyways -I downloaded the first book because it was in the list of Kindle Freebies - most of these books are passable at best and some are down right horrid - and it took me forever to finally que it up to give it a try. I was hooked by ten pages and flew through it in no time at all - Naomi Novik pulls you in and makes you feel like you personally know every one of her characters, dragon and human alike. Only one warning I would give potential readers - you WILL have to get the whole series as soon as you finish the first book - it's that good."
4,Great read if you like alternate history!,"I got this book for free download on my Kindle several months ago and became an instant fan of Naomi Novik! As soon as I finished it, I downloaded (and paid for!) the next 3 books in this series:Throne of Jade,Black Powder War,Empire of Ivory.I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it did get a little dry in places, but never for long. I found myself easily caught up in the politics of this alternate 19th century Britain as well as the developement of the author's dragon mythology. I particularly liked the way the characters learn about Temeraire's species even as the reader does.I highly recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy, especially alternate histories!"
5,Absorbing and original,"I fell in love with tenatious Temeraire and fearless Laurence. I have read all 5 of these books and cant wait for the next one! My favorite Genre, historical fiction, but spiked with a fantasy kick. Well done!"
3,The spirit of Moorcock,"People who enjoyed Michael Moorcock's seminal The Warlord of the Air and its sequels (see the omnibus A Nomad of the Time Streams) this series is for you! It has a lot of the same atmosphere, though maybe lacking the substance of Moorcock's work, which was a clever 'intervention' on his part, riffing off Edwardian imperialists like Kipling, Conrad and Wells and his whole point in writing the book. This is set in an alternate history of the Napoleonic Wars. Some of the dialogue seems a dash clunky to me and the books lack the authority of the Moorcock titles, but I liked these a lot better than, say, Turtledove's interminable stories. Good, light reading. Recommended."
2,"Interesting Idea, Poorly Developed Characters and Stiff Dialog","This book was a bit different from the ""fantasy"" books that I typically read, but since it was a free Kindle download I decided to give it a try. I was hooked by the story right away, but at the same time, turned off by how black-and-white the characters were, as well as how stiff the dialog came across. The only character that seemed at all believable, or even human, was ironically Temeraire the Dragon. Also, the battle scenes crawled along until they came to an abrupt climax & resolution, leaving you feeling as if you missed something.I'll be reading another volume or two of this series, in hopes that her writing style has improved enough to support an otherwise enjoyable storyline."
3,The best book about homoerotic bestiality I've ever read.,"No really, the best ever.This book is interesting enough to keep me reading, but more out of curiosity than any particular love of the characters or story. I don't think you will regret buying it, it doesn't take very long to read."
4,Surprising take on dragons,"I downloaded this novel on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. The story is about a British officer who finds himself bonded to a dragon. Once one is bonded to a dragon, the dragon becomes almost spouse-like in that the dragon is put first in the person's life.The dragon itself has a strong personality. Reading about the training facility and the way the dragons interact not only with their human bondsman, but also with each other is interesting. The author does an excellent job building the personalities of the dragons without making them seem as if they are humans that are called dragons."
4,The first of the Novik books about Dragons in Napoleonic Wars,"It liked it but now have to think if I liked it enough to spend $6.29 for each of the subsequent books in the series. Ok, I do.The concept being we are in the middle of the Napoleonic Wars.And all sides have dragons - the major weapons outside of sailing ships.And the dragons are smart, in varying degrees - some are puppy dog dumb and some are intellectual tacticians.But the dragons are almost just like Anne Mccafrey's - they bond with their riders at egg-hatching time and there is no room for a ""normal"" life.So we have a story based in England with air wars over the channel between ""wings"" of dragons.Very interesting, pretty well written...and I am now committed to reading more.As an aside: not quite as deep a story as Robin Hobb writes, but not as dark and depressing either."
3,Just average,"This book is average from a writing aspect and above average from a character development standpoint. It's hardly great as everyone makes it appear to be. Often times in the story the author jumps from one place to another in just the break of a paragraph. She also jumps time in a similar fashion. The book is not laid out very well. This makes it confusing to follow. There's no transition.Overall Temeraire makes the story. You watch an extremely intelligent dragon, mature during the book under the reigns of a mature captain who will do anything for the dragon. Interesting story line but poorly placed 3/5."
5,"Dragons and Historical Fiction, Fun for all!","Would you listen to His Majesty's Dragon again? Why?I'm not really in to rereading/listening/watching of books/audiobooks/movies so I don't think I would. Yet I really liked the books and would be willing to relisten to this book if too much time went by between the last book in the series I had read/listened and the next in the series. I would need a refresher.What other book might you compare His Majesty's Dragon to and why?I think at first I would compare it to Dragonriders of Pern series by Anne McCaffrey. Yes the two only has Dragon riders in common but that is all one needs, it fits that genera. Some dragon riding books I've read hasn't pulled you in to feeling for the dragon, both Dragonriders of Pern and Temeraire series did this."
3,Ultimately Too Cute,"This book and its quirky premise got off to a rousing start. But about halfway in I was up to here with talking, cute, English dragons. Especially the little sad one whose rider doesn't show it enough attention. One minor disbelief unsuspender was the author's insistence that these huge beasts only average about 25 miles an hour! Come on, a robin can fly faster than that."
2,A disappointment,"This book has been described as ""Horatio Hornblower with Dragons."" Since I am a huge fan of both the Horatio Hornblower novels and dragons this book seemed to be made just for me - so it was to my great surprise and disappointment that I realized I didn't like the book at all. With the exception of one side character (side dragon?), the characters just did not interest me - nor did the story. This book is the first of a series - perhaps the books improved. I do not know - after reading this first book I have never picked up the second."
3,love story between man and Dragon?,Ok I read the first two books in this series and it was strange. The writing was good and there was never lack of story line. But it is weird that there is mostly interaction with a guy and his dragon. It's like nothing else matters but his dragon. I don't know I thought it strange. I like a good romance and more of a friendship between the characters. This book was just too vague.
5,What a treat!,It was wonderful to find a new novel by this very accomplished and imaginative new author. I love this era and absolutely hate authors who don't bother to do their homework. Ms. Novik's alternate world was intriguing and convincing. The dialogue and characters POV seem accurate. It was a treat to find this book and I am eagerly anticipating getting my hands on the next two!
5,"Smart, detailed and entertaining-- highly recommended.","There are dragons, so it must be Pern. Right?Luckily, not in this book. I'm actually a huge fan of Pern, but the last thing that the world needed was another poor imitation of same.Actually, I found that I was reminded more strongly of the better books of L.E. Modesitt than those of the Ms McCaffrey. Novik writes with realism, concrete detail and a solid grounding in character. It is a very nice combination when applied to the subject matter.For me, His Majesty's Dragon was exactly the right thing at the right moment. I read it eagerly, and was only sorry that it was over too quickly. I would recommend it for anyone who is a fan of realistic fantasy, or for adventure fans who are not quite certain that they like fantasy at all. One of my best finds so far this year."
5,Fun reading!!,"I picked this book up while on vacation in California, and couldn't put it down. As preposterous as it may sound, Ms. Novik puts the reader into the action immediately, and makes you a kid again, believing in dragons. I was so enthralled, I rushed back to the store, and immediately bought the two succeeding volumes, and heartily recommend them to anyone who enjoys this genre. The last novel like this I enjoyed as much was The White Dragon, by Ann McCaffrey. This gives her a run for the money."
4,Surprisingly good,"Generally I don't like books that fantasize historical events. I'm not one for revisionist histories. What I like are stories with dragons. I also appreciate something clever and new. I found that I really got into this book which adds dragons to the Napoleonic wars with Brittan. I liked the Captain and his dragon, Temeraire. I thought the story was clever and fresh.Another reviewer criticized the characterization as naive and one-dimensional. I can't deny that this was somewhat true, but I found myself charmed by the story and the characters. I liked the writer's style. It felt like I was reading a period fiction."
4,Enchanting,"Nothing's better than British History with Dragons. This fast paced, well structured piece of AU was engrossing enough that I ran out to buy book 2 on my lunch break the day I finished it."
5,"Great book for the beach, or anywhere else","What a great idea for a story, and what excellent characters. I really got emotionally involved with the characters in this book - I find the passages about the attachment between the dragons and their humans particularly affecting. I've now finished Throne of Jade, and am happy to have found this series - all because this one was free on the Kindle!"
1,This product is horrible,"Hi, I ordered this product and I deeply regret it. Yes, the actual view is dim in the mirror as the other reviewer stated, but, even worse, the lights around the mirror will blind you. They shine right in your eyes and are really annoying. The actual mirror is pretty small, too."
5,Good Overall View of Hitler's Mistakes,"This book provides a concise overview of the many mistakes Hitler made during World War II that had dire consequences both for his grab for empire and Germany. While some of the things listed arguably didn't have an ultimate win-lose effect on Germany in the war (the failure to take Moscow and the failure to repel the D-Day invasion) others cannot be so easily disregarded. For example, several times Germany came close to vanquishing Britain early in the war and thus likely had a chance to win the entire war. The failure to destroy the British army at Dunkirk, the failure to invade Britain soon after the Dunkirk debacle, and the failure to destroy the RAF are all things that Hitler had within his grasp yet blundered the opportunities away (thankfully so for the rest of the world).This book should give most if not all readers a chill when they realize how frighteningly close Nazi Germany came to victory."
3,Whew....,"Very few books have ever frightened me. This one really did. It's amazing what the Nazis could've accomplished in WWII, given their will, resources, technologies, etc...The German war machine consisted of some of the most brilliant generals, who fully understood proper military strategy, including resource deployment, timing, and also, the importance of strategic withdrawal and recoup. Thankfully for us, Hitler was far too stubborn and caught up in his own irrational strategies and lunacy to listen to them."
4,Gripping Times,"I don't usually read a 600 page novel unless I really like it. Does anyone? Perhaps highly distubed masochists. I read it because it was an enjoyable story. The author takes us on a journey with Mary Ellen, a freed slave, and Colbraith, an ex-Tammanite, as they weave their tale through the intricate web of California's history. And a fascinating history it was. I do have one criticism: the author at times digresses into historical vignettes that are not germane to the story, though they are interesting vignettes (hence the deduction of one star in the rating). But overall it kept my interest and the story actually got better and better the deeper I delved into the novel. I understand there will be a sequel and I will read it."
4,No Ending,"This book was published 5 years ago and as yet, there is no Part Two. The ending left me hanging in mid air...so many unanswered questions!!! I totally enjoyed ""Pale Truth"", but if I had known the ending (or lack of it) was going to cause this much frustration, I would have waited until all three parts had been released."
2,"Interesting plot, wildly subpar writing","I find it very difficult to believe that this is a FINAL PRODUCT that has in fact been edited and published. This reads like the work of someone with a great head for facts and little to no talent with prose. I read the entire book, since I am reluctant to put down a book once I've started it, but I almost stopped reading this one very early on. Mr. Alef has shown no talent for creating an engaging story, and in fact, rendered an interesting premise almost unreadable. I can't help but think that Mr. Alef would have done better to 1) write this book with the help of a professional writer or 2) give all of his research over to a professional writer and remove himself completely from the crafting of this book. While I read this book, I could not help but think of how much better the material could have been in the hands of a more skilled author."
1,Why no song listing?,Why in the world would you present for sale a possibly good CD and not even list the songs included?
5,varied hiphop and electronica programming,"this compilation style cd does a good job at representing san francisco's solos records crew with tracks from seven different artists in 2004. tracks run the gamut along the vocal hiphop / instrumental hiphop / electronic downtempo divide... very impressive samples selection and drum programming ...all ""original breaks"" kinda drum samples gives these tracks a lot of individual heart. dj enso & louis' ""high spirits"" is a real catchy straight up hiphop banger... all the way down to the dark and abstract ""bookworm"" and ""jovian"" productions... all on moody, abstract kinda tip... something like rjd2 but darker... all these cats have obviously grown up post-dj shadow but they're going somewhere different... a bit weird at times... last time i checked, some of these tracks were available for free download off the solos records page: www.solosrecords.com. (plus i think there are live shows archived on there somewhere? does anyone know where that is?)"
5,Big Truths for Little Kids,This book is awesome. We are using it in our homeschool tutorial for open assembly. The children love the stories and they can hardly wait to hear the next one. It gives the children a firm foundation in Christ. The book also provokes further questions from the children. I highly recommend it for home or school use.
1,not useful for us...,"I did not like this book because of its huge emphasis on catechism. We believe that it's more important for children to ""hide God's word in their heart"" than it is to put questions & answers into a brainwashed program for kids. God's word is a ""double edged sword"" and if we can get it into our kids, God will do the job. Obviously, it's important to explain what the bible verses mean so that they can understand God's word that they are memorizing. Catechism is superfluous and this book overemphasizes it."
4,Surprised,"Because of several uses of the word ""catechism"" I made the mistake of thinking that this would be appropriate for a Catholic family. It is not. The catechism referred to is that of the Presbyterian church. That said, I will pass it on to a Protestant family with young children because it does look like a very helpful book."
5,Great resource for biblical training of young children,"I purchased this book as part of my home curriculum of bible study and truly love this resource. We have read 26 stories so far and I am so pleased with the stories and the exposure to the biblical values I hope to pass on to my children. Through the catechism, the kids learn our core beliefs of the Christian faith but it's through the relatable stories that the kids can grasp what our walk with God should look like. We have six children ranging in age from 1-9 and we all enjoy our family worship time. They won't let us go a day without doing ""catechism kids"". On a date night, they even had the babysitter read from this book! Love this book!"
2,Not very good,"This has pretty bad graphics. I don't know what that person was thinking when he said it has good graphics, the only good part is the intro. The gameplay is pretty easy but overall I wouldn't reccommend it to anyone."
5,Magicimage Filmbooks Presents: House of Frankenstein,"Still another in a great series of Classic Horror Filmscripts. Fully detailed and full of lavish photos, this book goes into censorship problems of that time and gives, in the script, an alternative destruction for Count Dracula. If you loved the movie or collect items on the Universal Monsters then this is a must have. Get this, and others in the Universal Filmscript Series, while you can!"
4,a track nowhere to be found,"this is a ""must"" for any brothers four collector. it contains a track ""nowhere to be found"", ""55 days in pekin"" from the homonimous film score. (this soundtrack is unavailable as on this writing). i own a b.f vinyl from the 60's, where i've heard it first, growing to be one of my favorites. this is the first cd including it. its absolutly worth the chance. b.f baritone choirs reach great deliverance, putting their unique accent on the emotional rendering of the story in the song. all other songs you already and probably know. this track is a plus plus."
3,Pretty Good,"'Turn Around' is a blues/gospel album that is quite good.This genre is not something that I typically like too well. I had the opportunity to listen to this CD though and I enjoy it. The artist is quite talented and has a spiritual message on this album.For those who enjoy the blues, this would be worthwhile to check out. It is also a good one for those who are interested in meaningful Christian lyrics."
3,"Turn Around, too personal","Well, it has his singing, or in this case, it seemed a bit more yelling than singing. Nowhere near as much guitar playing as in the past. It's fine that he wanted to make a statement on his personal faith but I think that the things that made him standout musically were overshadowed in the production of this one.I, too, am a Christian, but I like music. I like Jonny Lang, but I would be hesitant to recommend this album to someone interested in his playing.From the standpoint of him turning his life around, that's wonderful. But, to play on words, perhaps he should ""Turn Around"" to his roots when it comes to music and make an album that shows his musical strengths, not his spiritual strengths.It's a good addition to the collection, but I don't think it stands on it's own musically."
2,A Good Gospel Album,"I heard ""Anything's Possible"" before this album came out and I thought: ""Wow, J.L. is returning to his roots"". When I bought the actual album I was REALLY disappointed. Almost every song is gospel - tainted. I wouldn't mind a few tunes like that, but this album is very redundant.I will say Lang's voice is stronger than ever and the beats are pretty catchy but get ready for some preachin'."
1,Mediocre and disappointing,"This CD just doesn't compare with his previous work.Mediocre songs and singing.Lacks the soulful, bluesy feel of his past albums."
1,Worst Album I Have Ever Heard,"Man o Man, I love Jonny Lang. He is a Blues Giant, but I must say that this new album is just terrible. One song sounds like Stevie Wonder, the rest of the songs are just god awful. Depressing, slow, no JL tremendous guitar. I can honestly say that if he continues to change his style, and keep drifting away from his abilities, I will no longer be a fan. How sad. What the heck happened Jonny???"
1,Misleading and Wrong Title,"Problem with Jonny is that he believes he is a good singer. He is NOT. His terrible voice was suited and actuallly complimented his Blues/jazz rock stlye. This album is not only bad but it is excruciatingly painful to listen.Question he must ask himself. Would he be this well know if his 3rd and 4th albums were actually his 1st and 2nd ?Turn around ,,, I think NOT. Don't waste you money, this album will not get much airplay if any. Infact He himself says that in 3rd track of this looser.Pick up the guitar and melt some faces dude. thats what you do best. leave this mainstream stuff to others."
1,Not the Jonny Lang I know and love. Huge disappointment,Is it the artist? Is it the producer? Is it the label? Why does one of the most gifted young blues artists to hit the scene in decades suddenly veer off into trite pop music? Jonny Lang is both a gifted guitar player and singer with a blusey growl of a voice that belies his youth. Why then does this album showcase neither of these attributes choosing instead to focus on poorly written and badly charted pop ballads? Hopefully this is just one of those artistic misteps that will be rectified with the next album when Jonny returns to the gutsy blues singing and trancendent guitar solos of his earlier work. Please!
2,well.....,"It's better than the last one, I give him that. And, I'll even go so far as to say that there's one or two pretty decent songs on here. Unlike everyone else, I'm not going to whine because it isn't blues oriented (I don't think you could put him next to Albert King, Little Milton or Stevie Ray Vaughn). My problem with the album is that it's just all over the road...and not in a good eclectic way. He just sounds like he's uncomfortable as hell.I don't know what to tell you, dude. I hope you find your muse soon. I'm getting tired of being disappointed everytime I buy one of your albums"
2,Rick Blues Fan,This newest CD by Jonny Lang is VERY different than any other by him. On one hand it is slickly produced and has a sweet R&B sound. On the other it is NOT the blues. The guitar work by Jonny is negligible. There is none of the original blues sound of his other CD's. If you want R&B get this. If you want similar R&B get Al Green. If you want The Blues look elsewhere.
2,Where is the real Jonny hiding?,"What has happened to this guy? The people surrounding him have totally stripped him of any use of the guitar anymore which is what he was originally known for and it's just a shame. He still has an unbelievable voice which is very clear on this recording but the whole choir/pop/soul/religious bit isn't for me, this album makes me feel like I'm sitting in a church. I loved his last album ""Long Time Coming"" but this is borderline garbage compared to that. I'm from Minnesota so I grew up with his early stuff but I can't believe it has come to this for Jonny, what a shame!"
2,"""Turn back around""","Wow! Talk about a change. I was NOT pleasantly surprised with this album as I was with the previous ones. Turn back around and leave this one on the shelf, unless you're looking for good Christian music. Obviously not what I was looking for. Bring back the old Johnny!"
1,Not worth it!,"I have 2 of his previous CDs. He's wonderful. Saw him in the Blues Brothers movie and bought my first CD then. His music was amazing, voice unbelieveable from such a young man. With faith in hand I purchased this one. I listened once. Forced myself to listen again and gave up and gave it away. Terrible. I don't know what he did, or where he went with this music, but I can't go there. His 2 previous ones are well worth buying however. Don't let this one stop you from enjoying a really terrific performer."
2,"Music by Johnny Lang called ""Turn a round""","Johnny Lang has a very talented voice but is recording the wrong type of music or he needs support in how to use his voice with the music lyrics that capture his beautiful voice. It would be a shame not to see this voice mature and reach it's true potential. I found myself only remembering 1 song ""Turn a round"" because the rest of the album could not capture my attention but his voice range still lingers."
3,"Inspired, Yes; Inspiring? No","Others have commented that lovers of the early Jonny Lang were likely to be disappointed by his previous release. I bought it as soon as it came out...and was deflated by the somewhat shallow and uninspired step ""forward."" Here too, I find a once awesome talent literally inspired, but staggeringly uninspiring.I won't fault his basis for the work, or his performance. But being called on to make a statement of faith does not make that statement one worth choosing. There is little really fresh, astute or exceptional here. This Gospel neither contributes new nuance nor does it achieve the grand simplicity of lesser recording artists.Hopefully, Mr. Lang will consult a more entertaining muse next time 'round, or at least authors better able to provide a springboard into creative inspiration."
3,"Decent album, but I like his older more bluesy stuff better","This album is a departure for Johnny from his roots in the blues. Give it a try if you like, but be prepared to encounter more of a gospel feel, and less of a blues feel."
2,The slide downhill continues,"I have had high expectations for each of Jonny's albums as they have been released. The early ones are great. This is yet another step downward with one or two songs worth a few listens. However, one spin will do for most of the record. Nothing is particularly new or catchy. It's one to skip or to buy used on deep discount."
3,THE ATTACK IS GONE,"This work lacks that extra ""something"" that made Jonny's earlier work really jump. His voice is right up front, the singing is great. The songs are good, very good. But the attack is gone. Jonny needs to get that producer back he used to have, David Z. Chances are David is either (a) in rehab; (b) passed on; or (c) parted ways with Jonny for other reasons. Well, Jonny, either get him back or get someone else who can push your work that extra step further. Otherwise I will only be hearing you on the radio."
1,"If you are a guitar fan, stay away from this one","This CD lacks direction musically. The music attempts to sound like Stevie Wonder or soul but lacks genius. The guitar takes a backseat, and too many songs are in a similar key or phrasing. The vocals are forced and overstated.I tried hard to listen to this, but kept skipping tracks during multiple attempts. One minute you feel like you really want to like this, and it just doesn't have anything to grab on to. If you are looking for a blues rock album, check out the new Joe Bonamassa CD ""You and ME"". If you want a gospel album, go find a Mavis Staples disc or even Robert Randolph as they don't compromise musicianship. Johnny Lang should find his heartbeat again. I have seen him play, and he has the stuff. This is about as sacchrine and boring a disc I have ever listened. Bring on the Kids Bop version. Arghh!"
2,Turn Around - Jonny Lang's newest CD,"This is not up to par with his prior releases. I did not care for his genre with this album. I prefer his more bluesy music. He has a greatvoice and is a fabulous musician, but this CD does not bring out either abilities. It is a very average CD. In fact, I cannot remember a single tune from it 20 minutes after listening to it.I would like to see Jonny go back to the music that made him popular. I don't believe that it would go against his new-found faith."
1,Hated it !,"I've been a Jonny Lang fan for years. When I saw him perform live, he knocked me off my feet. His guitar playing is his forte'. Whatever, the reason is that he thinks he needs to change his style is beyond me.Don't waste your money on this snooze-fest. E-mail me and I'll send you the one I wasted my money on. I'll send it to you for free, I don't keep crap like this in my collection."
5,Don't Stop...Anything's Possible,"Very good album. Unlike the music or musicians currently out there, Jonny is creative. Mixing and matching different genres of music and writing lyrics that are far cry from the words being sung from top 40s stations or by other ""blues"" musicians.Personally, I love the organ, so that addition to this album was a big plus for me. (so was the choir)His voice is... Full of soul. Full of passion. Full of life.His attitude is humble. It's extremely hard to find this in general...but in the world of music it can be even harder. His talents don't ruin him. It seems to me that he appreciates his ability to reach people and touch them with the gift and power of music, Jonny Lang music.This album is full of HOPE (the reason for the five star rating)Just read the titles of the songs on this album"
1,Soulful music without a soul...,"I am (was) a great fan of Jonny Lang. I have seen him a few times in concert and loved that a young kid could play the guitar like he did.Sure this album changes from darker themes to a more christian theme but that is not my beef with the album. The problem is that he apparently has gradually given up on playing the guitar in his songs. He was an excellent soloist and if he wants to find religion, fine, just keep playing the instrument that got you there. He is dangerously close to becoming a christian-backstreet boy.Jonny, you dont have to do drugs or sing about sin to make great music. This is not, musically speaking, great music.Maybe next album..."
2,Not the Lang of old.,"This is an easy one for me to write. If you are expecting the gut wrenching blues of Lie to me or Wander this World, dont waste your money on this.If you want his new style, this is ok. I am not saying it is bad, it just isnt what you got on his early albums.Personally, I was very disappointed."
2,"Very Disappointing, Tiresome CD","Memo to Jonny L: what the heck happened to you? Are you spending too much time listening to what those record execs are telling you to play? You're a terrific guitarist and blues musician. So, what's with this lousy Gospel-style ""pop"" album? You're not Prince. You're not Mariah Carey. You're not even Justin Tiomberlake. You're not all that great a vocalist, and the material on this CD is weak, at best. But, you ARE one heck of a GUITARIST! So, next time, stick to what you do best. Forget trying to be a ""pop"" star and just be yourself. For those fans who fell in love with your passionate renditions of great blues tunes like Ike Turner's ""Matchbox"" on your first CD, this album is a waste. This CD, sadly, can't even compare to the genious you showed in LIE TO ME or WANDER THIS WORLD. Time to do a real ""turn around"" and return to your roots."
1,Where's the gut renching blues?,The long awaited album has finally come! I was so very disapointed! I was expecting his infamous gut renching blues and instead experienced this funky R&B stuff! Where's the blues? How can Jonny sing lie to me and Wander this world and then sing R&B? I don't get it! If you like r&b or gospel music this cd is for you! IF your a die hard blues fan do not buy this! I'm crossing my fingers for his next album! Until then I continue to be a fan of the old Jonny Lang!
4,Jonny Lang is unique,"The new Jonny Lang CD includes several Christian songs, and while I was skeptical at first, I really like the material. The songs are powerful and provide a good message. Lang's sound is unlike any other singer. I enjoy this CD very much."
2,Blues to R&B to Gospel Transition,Jonny left edgy guitar slinging blues-rock quite a while back if you did not realize. His current amalgamation is more of a hodgepodge than concert of styles for my taste. I would have preferred a harder core gospel as Dylan did with 'Saved'. Two stars only because as Gospel there is much better to be found. If it was under the Contemporary Christian category I would go three stars. (He is still touring bars/clubs and not the church circuit yet though.) Probably no stars anymore for blues or rock.
1,What Happened?,"Before I say anything else, I am a huge fan of Jonny Lang, going way back and have seen him nearly a dozen time in concert. That being said, What happened?I have listened twice now to ""Turn Around"" all the way through and I'm done... I looked forward to the new album coming out and I just can't believe what it sounds like. The songs are boring (Gospel? Please! Leave it to the gospel singers), the production is beyond bad, and they lyrics are complete drivel.Jonny - here's some free advice - less Weak falsetto, more Strong guitar."
3,Good transaction,"I ordered this cd for my son and this is not my type of music so I have no idea whether or not this is a good cd. It was delivered in good condition, however."
1,Unremarkable,"I heard Red Light and Lie To Me, and it's in a different league than Turn Around. Sure I like Bump In the Road and My Love Remains, (That was a little too hight pitched for me, but still)but everything else is strange. Who is this? Not Jonny Lang! It's not his roots. He needs the Lie To Me and Red Light again. Even thought Red Light is old, I can't stop listening it. Maybe his next album with impress me."
1,Read the reviews first!,"Four years ago I bought ""Lie To Me"" on a whim, never having heard or heard of Jonny Lang before. What a gem! So this week, when I spotted a new Jonny Lange disc at a very reasonable price, I was hoping lightning would strike twice. Unfortunately, that was not to be. This is painfull to listen to, even disregarding the ""gospel"" content (there's nothing musically ""gospel"" about it, BTW, just lyrically). Try as I might, I couldn't even manage to get more than about 2/3 of the way through it before I had to just turn it off. Guess I'll have to list it with Amazon in case those who enjoy it need a second copy. No more impulse buys for me. Read the Amazon reviews first!"
1,Is this the same Jonny?,"This album does not sound anything like ""Smokin"" or ""Lie to Me"". The only way I know its Jonny Lang is the cd cover. The goosebump-inducing guitar and aching voice are long gone. Jonny, you can be pious and play blues. There isn't a commandment against it. I guess marriage has made him too mellow. Check out his old stuff; its great. This album is rubbish."
5,Incredible Album,"This album a progression musically, and lyrically, theme of redemption and the way he delivers the message oozes with passion. This is my favorite album of the year. This album should garner a lot of new fans ... old fans should be thrilled with this release as well."
5,The day I will NEVER forget!,"I was there at Armagddon, Dec. 12, 1999, and I had the most incredible time ever. I thought it was going to be so boring because I thought the matches were going to be bad, but it wasn't. I took 64 picture that night and I was so close. I was right in front of the pool. But if you dont want to see a second of nudity then dont get it. But I advise everyone to watch it. HHH vs McMachon was the best match of the night yeah it was a shocker the ending but it was still good. I will never foeget this night the best night of my life."
4,The WWF delivers again!,"I ordered this one live. Another great PPV from the WWF to close out the millennium. I give it 4 stars because the title match was Big Show (champ) vs. Big Boss Man. The main event was Vince McMahon vs. Triple H in a no-holds barred showdown! Good undercard which included: Steel Cage Match: X-Pac vs. Kane, Jericho vs. Chyna for the Intercontinental Title, Bulldog defending the European title in a Triple-threat match against Val Venis and D'lo Brown, a tag-team battle royal, and my personal favorite, the 4-Woman Evening Gown in the Pool match where Ivory defended against Miss Kitty, Jacqueline, and BB. Miss Kitty has some nice...anyway, a must have!"
4,WWF Armageddon 1999,"This ppv is most remembered for 1 little stunt pulled by Miss Kitty.Matches and Ratings1) 16-Man Tag Team Battle Royal- good battle royal2) Kurt Angle vs. Steve Blackman- **3) WWF Women's title, Four Corners Evening Gown Match in a Pool: Champion Ivory vs. Jacqueline vs. B.B. vs. Miss Kitty- can't really rate this, its not an actual match 4) Rikishi Phatu & Viscera vs. Hardcore & Crash Holly- 1/2*5) European title: Champion British Bulldog vs. Val Venis vs. D'Lo Brown- *6) Cage Match: X-Pac vs. Kane- ***1/47) Intercontinental title: Champion Chyna vs. Chris Jericho- ***1/28) Tag Team titles: Champions New Age Outlaws vs. The Rock & Mankind- **1/49) WWF title: Champion Big Show vs. Big Boss Man- 1/4*10) No Holds Barred Match: Triple H vs. Mr. McMahon- ***"
4,"A good PPV, but NOT the Best of 99","A lot of reviews say that this was the best ppv of 99. well, it was a good ppv, but not the best. The only real match that changed any big plots was the Mcmahon v HHH match. This match set up the whole mcmhon-helsley era, which is the current main plot.Anyhow, if you are going to spend 40 or 30 bucks on a ppv, dont buy this one. here are some good ones...*No Mercy 99~ Two words Ladder Match. plus austin v HHH was a good fight.*Wrestlemania 15~ Maybe the best wrestlemania, Austin v Rock one of the best matches ever.*Wrestlemania 10~ For you old schoolers. The 2nd best Ladder Match of all time.*Surviver Series 99 or 97~ Relive the injury to Austin or the real-life SCREW JOB of Bret Hart."
1,Are you blind?,"Tell me who rated tihs PPV 5 stars?It was simply one of the worst ppv i ve ever seen and i can tell you i watched most of the ppv these last 4 years 'till last Bad Blood 2003.The show was pathetic;a good symbol to describe this event is the story line between Big bossman(how old is this man? 254 years old?) and the death of Big Show's father...No comment on the Bossman coming up at the cimetary to take the casket...Who the he thinks he is? THE UNDERTAKER?Another very bad match was the one with Triple H and Vince simply idiot as the bookers of the time..And let's not forget the triple threat match between val venis ,d'lo and I don't remember the last one...Only confused and slow moves in this event; a good point for the rock n sock connection who made this disaster a PPV..."
1,Cheap Sounds,Compare with other sound effects recordings. This recording seems to have been produced from cheap recording equipment and is not very realistic. You can do a lot better.
4,"Eclectic, Interesting, and Appropriate.","I'm one of those freaks that enjoys obscure horror movies and tripped over ""The Sore Losers"" in a DVD 12 pack that contained 8 nasty vampire movies and three zombie movies that were obviously funded by a rich uncle and directed by a 18 year old. The Sore Losers was the rare gem in this pile of crap. It references obscure 1950's fanboys, supernatural asian assassins, hippie executions, comic culture, dominatrix, mass murderers, immortals, wrapped in classic cars and empty decayed settings from Southern Middle America. It had such a good soundtrack that I became obsessed with the production and hunted down this copy.Well worth a listen / viewing. Odd and disturbing. Don't say I didn't warn you."
1,tarnished,I do not care for the aluminum set. As far as it being sharp... That is not a problem the knives are very sharp. I don't care for the texture of the handles as they feel a bit odd. Also the handles are tarnishing after only two uses. Perhaps they are not dishwasher safe but I don't recall a warning on that. All in all I am not a fan
4,Honor to an Icon,"I always think how great it is when someone like Paul is recognized throughout decades of changing music. My favorite song on this tribute would by all means be "" MY BRAVE FACE ""I am a huge fan of SR71 and I would not expect them to perform this song any less artistically than they do their own.This band is so under rated and deserves the recogintion of music fans all over the world. This new recording by SR71 is just another form of diversity that this awesome group offers consistantly in their melodic, energetic original rock and roll."
5,Songs that stand the test of time...,"Although its taken this long to come out with a solid tribute to one of the best lyricists of our time-I think everyone would agree-its been well worth the wait. While no one can do a McCartney hit like McCartney, to hear modern artists do ""Junk"" (Barenaked Ladies) and ""Every Night"" (Matthew Sweet), to name a couple from the record, proves that these hits stand the test of time very well--what better compliment to their creator."
1,"""Enough Already With The Reissues!""","What is with the American record companies anyway?Every Sinatra fan from Kentucky to Kenya probably has every track on this album 20 times over....and do we really need ANOTHER re release of ""Strangers In The Night???""There's a lot of major material lying around in Warner Brothers vaults that has yet to see the light of day: the audio soundtracks to the 60's 'Man and His Music' specials; the ""retirement"" concert in 1971; an unissued concert at Carnegie Hall from 1973 etc.Sinatra fans are craving access to this material without being subject to the poor quality of inferior bootlegs.I know that Nancy, Tina and Frank Jr. supposedly own the rights to much of this material....c'mon guys--put the bootleggers out of business and give your dad's fans something NEW to listen to!"
4,Good but not Tops,"this set loses points just for that cheap duet with Celine Dion.there isn't any era that She would be able to hang with Frank Sinatra.overall there are better Compilations that are far fuller than this set.nevertheless it has many solid Moments.""Fly Me TO THe Moon"" alone is Classic Sinatra all the way."
2,Not up to his best,"The problem with this album is it has not been ""digitally remastered"" which makes the sound old & odd. Not a compliment to Frank Sinatra's masterful voice. A real let down."
2,not what I expected,I didn't really feel like some of the songs were really love songs. A lot of these songs I had not even heard before.
2,A Man From Corpus Christi,"For its day, it was an interesting adventure book about all of the problems associated with travel in coastal Texas. Although this was a scientific expedition, the book was written more for humor than facts. The author definitely was appealing to his New England audience when he characterized the people and conditions in the Deep South."
1,not the right thing,Was nice material in pants. But the opening in back just didn't work out.My mother was left with a bare back and nurses aid's refused to use them.
4,Distilled wisdom of a social psychologist,"Stumbled on this book while digging for a better understanding of how organizations behave and what a discovery! It is a classic masterpiece. Classic because the language and contextual references are a little too outdated (1800's). It's a masterpiece because the essence of this study is as relevant today, as it was back then. I could hardly gather the historic references but still the language is very lucid and leads to a completely new perspective, a rational one to analyzing the social-political-economic-&-psychological meshwork that forms and controls the crowd(s). Be it the Arab spring; demonstrations in Greece, India and elsewhere; London riots, crowd sourcing and many more such recent and historic developments - it all starts lightning up. If mass social actions intrigue you and you can digest or overlook the 1800's historical references - this distilled wisdom of Gustave Le Bon (a social psychologist), is worth a read."
4,Insightful and on-target,"Granted, much of what Le Bon writes in The Crowd went over my head. At the same time, a good portion is clear enough for the layperson to grasp."
3,"pointless, but was the first book on crowd psych","This book is filled with generalizations and class based stereotypes. All of its assertions have been refuted by actual study (see tim couch, coser etc.) However, this is credited as the first book on crowd psychology. If you interested in seeing what everybody is refuting, pick it up. However, if you want to truly understand the nature of crowds this book is a waste if time. I'd liken it to the Bell Curve, hilarious in its assertions but a good framework to refute"
2,Ok - But no looker,"Delta Force Black Hawk Down plays ok. It looks bloody awful though. Halo it isn't, Doom it isn't, an average FPS it is.If you have seen the PS2 version like i have, you maybe left wondering why thge Xbox version looks like a completely different game, different as in no where near as good.For die hard fans of the PC version only."
1,Xbox owners short changed again!!!,"Why oh why do the Playstation 2 owners get a spanky all new version of Deltaforce Black Hawk Down complete with spanky new visuals while the Xbox owners are served second best sub par rubbish? The Xbox owners get an average direct from PC conversion complete with coverted visuals from the original PC version of Deltaforce Black Hawk Down that were never that hot in the first place, all those years ago. If anything, the Xbox owners whould have be served a superior version over the Playstation 2 version.Signed: One very unhappy Xbox owner :("
1,Warning!!!!! Do not buy this game......,This has to be one of the worst games I have ever played. The graphics are just horrible the framerate is subpar. When playing on-line you see your teammates going through walls and you lose them. The weapons stink and load times are long long for an xbox game. The animations when hitting a bad guy is horrible. The off-line missions are short and boring. This game was to be great for the on-line play but that is one of the worst on-line games ever.. save your money guys.. get ghost recon summit strike next week.. that should be great..
1,did not like it,"did not like it. it being DELTA FORCE BLACK FORCE DOWN on the XBOX. All points made by Poor port to XboX are spot on. Delta force comes across like it needed about another years worth of work doing on it, the game feels rushed and the action dated."
1,worst war game on Xbox,"The Xbox effort of Black Hawk Down is the worst of worst FPS'ers on Xbox. If good looking games turn you on, then Black Hawk Down is guaranteed to turn you off. While being no Halo to look at, it don't near by a long long shot. The game is like 20 billion years too late. This game is not worthy of adding to your Xbox collection. It was in mine for less than a week! before i managed to get an exchange on the thing. Not worth a rental, a try before you buy. Best rent a movie instead. At least that way you'll get atleast 1 hours worth of fun!!!"
1,Pointless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If your gonna convert a PC game to the Xbox, the first thing to do would be to chosse a good PC game to convert in the first place. This is where the problems lie for black hawk down, the PC game was very average to begin with. Imagine taking that very same average of average PC games and converting it to Xbox 4 years down the line without any improvements what so ever (Er???) atleast the Playsation 2 Black Hawk was 100% *NEW* graphics, which kinda helps!!!"
1,"Bad, So Very Bad.","You know when an Xbox game is going to suck big time whenA:Your family buy you a game you never asked forB:Theres a stick on the front that reads PORTIONS OF THE MONEY GENERATED FROM BLACK HAWK DOWN ARE DONATED TO COLLEGE FUNDS FOR CHILDREN OF SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIERS WHO HAVE DIEDOh i feel so much better now that i am helping children of dead soldiers by playing such a retarded game as Black Hawk.For a first person shooter, Black Hawk is down there with the worst of the bunch. On a console like the Xbox, there are so many other super FP.Shooters out there. Halo, Halo 2, Doom to name but a few.Dont waste your money on this sub standard dated looking affair.And if you want to help children of dead soldiers, then give money direct to them, not via an Xbox game."
1,whats going on?,"Ok, so i donot own this game, i have however seen other people playing it in a local store. On looking for a cheaper deal here at Amazon and reading the reviews i was left in doubt. 1 star reviews and 5 star reviews? im left thinking that the 1 star reviews are from customers, games players and the over the top 5 star reviews are from the people behind Black Hawk Down."
1,Trash,Game didn't work even read in the system so obviously never checked it before sale I do give them the respect on how quick it was shipped and how helpful and understanding they were with return
1,not what sopose to be,Not what suppose to be did not like it does not fit x box 360 came with no box and not the correct item send it back
1,Better Games out there,"I don't play multiplayer shooters. So I only played this is single player mode. I thought this game was cumbersome, shifting weapons took too long. They equip you with a binocular but the bad guys only appear when you get closer. And most times they appear from out of no where. They just suddenly materialize! In the desert no less.Mannig the Machinegun on top of the Humvee was kind of hokey, not very fun or very challenging.If you own a PC and you can find it buy Operation Flashpoint, or if you have a newer PC buy Armed Assault."
2,Average game,"On the positive side, the makers of the game put an emphasis on atmospherics. The enemies were poor fighters but there were plenty of them, just like the actual event. The maps are big so the experience is confusing, just like the actual event. The music is very good.On the negative side, the graphics are below average, the AI is poor, and the squad control is practically non-existant. They should have spent more time upgrading this game before releasing it.The best part of this game is the online playing which does have a lot big maps and is easy to get into. However, there is much they could have learned from the Tom Clancy series of games!"
3,A Dissapointment,I played the game at a friends house for ps2. I loved it so when i went home i bought for xbox. It wasnt the same. I was greatly dissapointed with the graphics and gameplay. xbox live was cool with 50 people but it was too glitchy
1,Lacks any real punch,"For me Black Hawk Down came across as a wishy washy over hyped war shooter that failed to stand up against the many other war styled shooters in my Xbox collection. To put it very simply, not a great game by any lengths."
1,Poor XBOX port,"This game just sucks. I tried it out on PS2 at ToysRUs and that version was pretty cool. The XBOX version plain sucks.1) In voice commands, where the hell is ""Cover Me!"", ""goto waypoint"". Not realistic at all.2) AI is just stupid. Unless the ""skinny's"" were that dumb this is one of the poorest AI's I have ever seen.3) MP is the worst of any XBox live game I have ever seen."
1,Beware Formula Change!,"This tea has been our favorite green tea for years. According to the manufacturer, Hain Celestial, the ingredients have recently changed. They removed the hibiscus. Be warned, the tea is now yellow-green and tastes awful. The box and ingredients list have not changed. We are stuck with 2 cases that we can't return to Amazon."
1,"They did a ""New Coke"" disaster!","I ordered two cases for my Mom who loved (past tense) this tea. They really did not improve this product like they claim. They took out the Hibiscus and added white tea ""for a smoother taste"". It does not have the fantastic raspberry taste it used to have at all. Now we have two cases that nobody wants to drink. I did manage to scour my local grocery stores (7-8 of them) and find the last 5 boxes in my area. All I can say is that I/we hope that Celestial Seasonings comes to their senses and goes back to the original formula. And yes we did contact Celestial Seasonings and make complaints with them. Why do companies have to go and mess up a good thing?"
1,Lost the flavor,"This tea used to have excellent raspberry flavor. They have now reformulated it with white tea and it may be more healthy, but it has become flavorless. I have asked several friends to try it and all agree it essentially has no flavor. Unfortunately, I haven't found any replacement as good as the ORIGINAL Raspberry Gardens."
3,So so,Shipping and service was great as usual. They changed the formula on this so the taste is not as good as it used to be.
2,What Raspberry??,"I had tried this tea a while back and loved it, so I thought I would try it again. After reading the other reviews (unfortunately after I already bought it), I realized that the ingredients aren't the same. Well, either is the flavor of the tea! The Raspberry taste is definitely very weak. I wish they would change it back to the old recipe."
5,"Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, Raspberry Gardens","Makes GREAT iced tea for the spring and summer months.... Very refreshing. In a hurry? No need to boil water. I add 5 tea bags to a 2 qt. container,hot or room temperature water, let it sit on the counter for awhile then refridgerate....."
5,Great healthy teeth treat and at excellent price,"These treats help your dog to keep the plaque off their teeth, or at least that is what I have read, and are a much better alternative to some dog chews that can get stuck in their throat after they are chewed on for a while. Moreover, this is the best price anywhere."
3,adapting the battery pack to the camera,"I did not knw that by buying this battery pack that I would have to remove the doorway from the camera's battery storage, something that I am reluctant to do."
3,OK I guess,"Fair soundtrack, but leans totally to rap, leaving out quite a bit of excellent music in the process - too bad!"
4,This cd is awsome,"Yo Bob from St. Louis MO says: ""I'm getting tired of all these hate crimes in rap..."" [...] I love rap and I think that people choose what to listen to. Rappers are allowed to express their views. [...]"
3,Pretty good effort,The soundtrack was above average however i was disappointed that one of the songs in the movie when the three black guys are riding in the chevy impala and there a heavy beat and some angry tight lyrics is not on the soundtrack.Does anyone know what this song is??
4,Very Strong Soundtrack except......,"....it was missing one very key song from the film. I couldn't believe Cypress Hill's ""(Rock) Superstar"" was excluded from the track list. Still a very powerful cd, but one of the film's integral pieces of music was missing. This song was used in every trailer for the film and should have been the first track on the soundtrack."
3,Missing song,"this rap compilation is ok but im one of those persons who like to hear all the songs included in the film.""El Cuarto de Tula"" performed by Buena Vista Social Club was one of many missing traks from the movie, it appears when Alonzo Harris was driving over a bridge somewhere LA before they scared out the college kids listening ""Last Resort"" of Papa Roach."
1,High Price paid for mis represented product!,"I ordered 4 jars of the Milkmaid Tea from this vendor, having purchased it before from a store 20 miles away from me, it was more convenient to order online. The picture on the page SHOWS a 4oz package, and that was the size I had purchased previously, so I ordered 4 of them, hoping to stock up.When I opened the package (which did arrive promptly) I was dismayed to see 4 TWO ounce tubs of tea!$8.88 for a 2 oz tub of this tea is RIDICULOUS. I have written the company Doula Shop for a refund, and will wait to see what happens."
3,A Satisfying Straight-To-DVD Monster Flick,"Sparing you a briefing of the weak and equally useless plot, ""Creature Unknown"" is one of those direct-to-DVD horror flicks that are more fun than they are scary. The reason it's worth three stars is the monster. Ignoring the recent craze of CGI, the crew created a full-body suit for the actor playing the creature -- and the hard work certainly payed off. The costume is very realistic and keeps the viewer interested. But, sadly, that's all there is to this movie. The only reason you should rent ""Creature Unknown"" is if you're a monster fan who enjoys the simple pleasure of seeing a murderous creature rip apart naive teenagers (including decapitations and gut-slashing). Not to mention, decent special features such as bloopers, a documentary on the film, and a documentary on the creature."
3,ANOTHER LIZARD-MAN FILM,"The movie opens with lizard man killing two girls. We know lizard man is watching because the film gives us a blurry fish eye. During the credits we see a ""subplot"" of a woman experimenting with lizards.After the credits, Steve is e-mailing/texting his close circle of friends who are not close anymore and haven't been since high school when his brother Wes was killed. They are getting together, 4 years late, to pay homage to Wes. The personalities don't mesh as they all ride up in a single van...to the land of no cell phone reception where monsters roam and people die.While they are there, Chase Masterson shows up on a motorcycle.While this is not the worst horror film, this isn't one for the ages either. Too many daylight killings to be an effective horror movie. The creature was better than the rubber masked kind. The special flame effects was bad. The music was hit or miss as was the acting.F-bomb, brief nudity (Kristin Herold shower scene)"
1,Feature Uninspired,"The monster from Enemy Mine somehow made his way into a small mountain community, where he has taken up residence. He's being hunted by a female doctor-turned-vigilante who is out to exterminate him. This female assassin, who looks like a refugee from a Motley Crue video, rides around on a motorcycle and tries to save a bunch of kids who have chosen to have a Big Chill weekend right smack dab in the middle of the monster's turf.Decapitations and lots of blood are primarily in place to draw attention away from the story which limps along like a bad version of the Island of Dr. Moreau (and yes, it's worse than the one with Val Kilmer)."
3,A THROWBACK TO THE FIFTIES,"I guess since I just watched the abominable DEADLY SCAVENGERS last night, viewing CREATURE UNKNOWN was like GONE WITH THE WIND. At any rate, this movie reminds me a lot of those tacky scifi films from the fifties. Although the creature's effects are by no means state of the art, they are much better than the cockroaches in the aforementioned Scavengers flick. And I give the screenwriters credit for coming up with an unexpected ""twist"" at the end regarding the identity of the genetically mutated lizardman. The actors won't make us forget truly good actors, but they passed the easy on the eye test, and you'd appreciate that after watching the cast of the once again aforementioned Scavengers movie. All in all, my wife and I were entertained, and we're hard to please sometimes, but when comparing this to the uh oh once again aforementioned Scavengers movie, this one is a gem."
1,As bad as I expected it to be,"This movie has a poor plot, cheesy effects and forced acting. 'Prom Night' is a masterpiece next to this movie and with the exception of Chase Masterson, it would be a major accomplishment for any of the actors in this film to end up on the Surreal Life."
3,"Okay, but not 'great' by any means...","In retrospect I would have preferred one of the 'open' towel rings/thinga-ma-bobbers over this since it's kind of awkward to fold a towel and then thread it neatly through this ring (okay, my fault...I saw what it was when I ordered it). But this thing squeaked from day one and doesn't feel nearly as sturdy as it looks in the picture. I bought a towel ring somewhere else, T****t, that is MUCH sturdier than this one (about the same price), and it never squeaked. I guess I can oil it, but it should have come squeakless IMO."
4,Received exactly what I wanted,"These arrived quickly, were easy to install and look great in my remodeled master bathroom. They match the handles on my new vanities perfectly! They look very rich for their price."
1,Great Looking Figures that are poorly made,"The figures are nicely sculpted. The light up eyes feature is a bonus. However, the figures joints are poorly made. They break very easily. Some even break while still in the box tied wrap. I strongly don't recommend it."
4,an enjoyable vampire novel,"This was an enjoyable vampire novel. Baker does a good job of building up an empathy with Ardith, the novel's central character. Via a set of nasty circumstances she goes from being a conventional-contientious student to a wild-child vampire and sets out for revenge on the people who did this to her. This is the last thing she had ever expected to happen to her - and would never have happened when she was ""good"". This is a novel I'm glad I've read and I'm looking forward to the sequel ""blood and chrysanthemums""."
4,Toilet seat sox - great invention,"Toilet seat sox are a great invention. Washable. Changeable. Warmer to sit on than naked seats. A little coaxing was required to get it over our round toilet seat, otherwise perfect and great fun."
4,Review to the tapes,"I thought that the videos had a lot of info about the rumores at area 51. The videos had speculations as to what is flying around in the skies at night over area 51, and how the government denies its existance. I never thought the movies were boring, and the only thing I thought that needed help was to make the videos shorter and be put on to one tape."
3,Okay,The dolls do not look enough like the characters from Aladdin. I think my daughter would play with this more if they looked a little more realistic. It is still a pretty cute toy and I like the fact that it stores easily.
2,Trite,"After seeing Lucy flagellate her poor Martin guitar in concert in SF I began to realize that Lucy is a minor artist with a few good songs and fantastic backup. This album continues the great backup but leaves out the few good songs. Mostly you-done-me-wrong and you-slept-with-someone-else tunes, the album seems the self righteous rantings of someone unwilling to examine thier own complicity in a love gone bad. Great production, though."
5,Rawrtopsy!!!!,"Contains Autopsy's first two demos and two live tracks. Raw, demo quality recordings here-but the performances and the songs themselves make up for any shortcomings. The 1987 Demo has some interesting material on it, but I liked the Critical Madness demo best. On CM you get a pretty bitchin' take of ""Ridden with Disease"" that personally I like better than the recording on ""Severed Survival"". ""Charred Remains"" and ""Critical Madness"" both appeared on ""Severed Survival,"" but it is awesome to here them in the infant stages of development. The 1987 demo has ""Human Genocide,"" a really good song that I don't think made the cut for any of their albums, which is a shame because it warrants a good studio treatment, though the demo level production here just adds ambiance to the proceedings. The live recordings have decent sound, and they add a nice finish to the album. I would recommend this to anyone who is a big collector of Autopsy or Death Metal in general."
4,Needs help,"I ordered this product to aid in my engine rebuild,have since put the stand together and it works well.Only downfall to the product is the instructions included are obviously from a different country and the pictures are small and blurry.I also want to warn others that it does not include bolts for your engine your looking to spend $20 more for some grade 8 hardware.overall would recommend."
4,"Good product, bad instructions","This is a good product, and looks like it will serve my needs. The assembly instructions are not so good, but if you are mechanically inclined, you should have little trouble assembling it. It works best if you ignore the instructions and just work from the illustration.Torin T24541 1000 lb. Engine Stand"
2,Terrible directions / parts missing,"The assembly instructions for this product are terrible. I ended up using the picture, but the quantities listed for certain items (i.e. washers, nuts, etc.) were not accurate, making it difficult. Also, there are supposed to be four wheels and my package only had THREE! Frustrating. I will attempt to contact the factory, but I'm not holding my breath."
3,Bleak,"The film had a good tension level, and opened well and held my interest, but at a certain point I found it to be rather bleak, somewhat flat, with a poor ending. I thought Polanski could have done much, much better."
1,Pity,"The Ghost Writer is a propaganda film by Roman Polanski in the form of a triller. The film makes two points: one is that the CIA and the USA are ruthless, evil and criminal; and the other that the British Prime Minister is a CIA plant since his early twenties. Were it not for the PM doing the CIA's bidding, Britain would not have been America's ally in foreign policy matters, including the Missile Defense Initiative.Although the premise that a top government official is a plant and working against his own country is interesting, the persistent CIA/USA bashing gets tiresome. The acting is OK, there is some suspense, but it is not a clever story. The CIA is clever enough to control a country's leader and thus, policy, yet their agents can be found on Google. There are other very dumb things. There is no escaping the feeling that Polanski, who co-wrote the screenplay with Harris, hates America and will use his position to brainwash people."
1,embarrassingly naive,"I have to admit I actually felt ashamed I watched the movie until the end. The movie insults intelligence of a viewer by piling up cliches that were tiresome when we heard them over five years ago. The plot is naive to the extreme: a weak ghost writer outsmarts team of professional CIA agents and heads of governments and all what it takes him are three days of drinking and some Google searching. Finally, the movie caters to worst category of conspiracy theorists. Polanski for one should have known better."
2,Brutal,"I love the actors in this movie and wanted to like this movie, but it's impossible. The story just plods along. This is the classic ""checking your watch to see how much time is left"" movie.Too bad--lots of potential, but Polanski misses the mark."
3,Very good visuals and competent acting,"I especially liked the visual treatment of this film -- a thoroughly professional job. And the acting was fine, with Pierce Brosnan seeming to improve with age. Of course, his ingenue years found him mostly in roles that required looks more than acting. But for some reason, perhaps because her role has no sexual implication, Kim Cattrall was allowed to look rather unattractive. The story is resolved in an unconventional way for this kind of yarn, although it works well considering that our ghostwriter for no apparent reason chooses to reveal his hand to exactly the wrong people."
4,The Ghost Writer,"This political thriller should appeal to most men and women. Our story opens when a retired polictician (Pierce Brosnan) hires a ghost writer (Ewan McGregor) to do his memoirs. As McGregor starts to do his research he not only finds the previous ghost wrtier died under mysterious circumstances, but the man he is working for may have been an agent with the CIA with a dark past. As he digs deeper his life is in danger and it is uncertain who is friend and who is foe. Well casted, directed, cinematography, effects, and good music. I recommend it highly if you enjoy thrillers. If you enjoyed this catchChinatown (Special Collector's Edition).CA Luster"
2,"No Tension, Predictable & Disappointing Film from a Great Director","What happened to Roman Polanski? If this film had been made by anyone else, they would have said it was a bomb. I was so disappointed by the lack of tension and the preponderance of cliches in this film. Pierce Brosnan was good as a Tony Blair-like Prime Minister, but Ewan McGregor gets my vote as one of the most bland and colorless movie stars out there. Kim Cattrell's character didn't make much sense. I didn't care for any of the characters and the denouement was interesting but the ending just fell flat to me (like McGregor's body). Some parts of the film dragged on to the point where I was falling asleep (Ewan talks. Brosnan talks. They talk some more. Then more talk.) Was Polanski too worried about his upcoming trial in the U.S. to make a good, suspenseful thriller? I felt he was uncommonly restrained in what should have been a nail-biting thriller. Oh well...I guess even great directors have bad days."
1,Surprisingly disappointed,"After all of the critical acclaim for this movie, I had expected to really like it. I'm a fan of thrillers, but it was an incredible disappointment. Scenes are stilted, and often the actors project an urgency and paranoia before the plot has actually built enough suspense to warrant it. As the movie progresses, the lead character (Ghost Writer 2) alternately behaves as if he's 1) scared for his life and 2) perfectly happy to be in harms way. I won't dwell on the ending except to say that it's one of the worst I've seen in a long time. When the movie ended, the only thing I felt was anger that I'd wasted over 2 hours watching it."
2,Blu-Ray Review,What a boring movie. Blu-Ray quality is fine but the movie itself was too slow and I didn't feel it was suspenseful. Other people love it.
3,PinkosRUs,"The movie is really not that bad, but this holistic-pinko attitude to everything spoils all the possible pleasures. Otherwise, it is a pretty decent movie that keeps you guessing until the very end."
2,"Plus ca change, plus ca reste le membe chose","Yet another Polanski movie about a hapless do-gooder who wants to do right, but ultimately cannot. Dig the ironic ending!"
3,Second-Tier Polanski,"Director Roman Polanski has crafted a stylish yet astonishingly predictable thriller based on Robert Harris' topical 2007 novel. Despite the familiar twists and turns, a strong cast and Polanski's formidable skill maintain interest. ""The Ghost Writer"" does not rank with the filmmaker's best work, yet it is miles ahead of earlier misfires such as ""Frantic"" and ""Bitter Moon."" Worth seeing for Ewan McGregor's compelling performance in the title role."
4,"Yes, it has its faults","Still it's a riveting thriller. And the acting is almost believable .. how many times can you say that about a recent movie?You can read about the plot and its holes in other reviews.Addendum: My BIG question about the movie is:If you hire a Ghost-writer who finds out about your sordid past and has to be bumped-off, why bother hiring a 2nd writer, who also discovers the same .. why not just drop the memoirs?"
2,About blu-ray edition (five stars for the movie),"This is a comment about the Blu-ray edition not about the movie.When I purchase this blu-ray I don't read the cover that says ""BLU-RAY+DVD -BOTH VERSIONS ON ONE DISC-"". This is annoying, I personally hate this practice of using both sides of a disc to put different versions of a movie (Wide-Full on past DVD's). In this particular case, to put the blu-ray edition on one side, and the DVD version on the other.I prefer to get only the blu-ray version (in what I'm interested) instead of getting both on one disc.How much can cost a separate disc?Please Summit Entertainment, don't continue with this practice."
2,Surprise Surprise,"Wow, in a million years I would have never guessed this plot. Let's see, Roman Polanski, the rapist, (or was it really rape rape, better consult Whoopie ), directs a movie about Tony Blair and President Bush. And much to my surprise, guess what? Bush is stupid, Blair is a puppet of the US, and the CIA is evil. Never saw that one coming. And the really odd thing, no mention of all the deaths, rape and torture caused by terrorist, oh I'm sorry, man made disasters. The only redeeming line was by Blair, take two planes, one taking all measures to insure safety, and one where security is performed in a perfunctory manner. Which one would you put your children on?"
1,Piece of Political Dung,"Agenda driven America -hating drivel! The central plot is that the CIA kills gobs of people to protect knowledge that a British Prime Minister renditioned terrorist to the CIA to be waterboarded.The Prime Minister is corrupted by the evil Halverton Corp-get it- Halverton Corp. You know the leftist favorite punching bag Halaberton.Roman Polanski, the convicted chld , rapist if he was capable of shame should be.# 1 Waterboarding is not torture and was common knowledge.# 2 Every American military pilot or special op,s personnel was waterboarded.# 3 Thousands of innocent lives were saved from terrorist SLAUGHTER by this technic.Great fun for the love your local terrorist fool. Made to indict Bush but Obama has raised the practice of redition to countries that do alot worse than waterboarding to an art form. Don,t waste your time unless you're a Code Pink idiot!The only thing this piece of tripe was missing was Matt Damon."
1,Read the book or Torrent,"Robert Harris book, the Ghost, is excellent. It is a pure thriller and well worth the read. Yet this movie is tainted by the actions of the Director. You can not buy this movie without contributing to a un-repentant and un-punished child rapist. Therefore this work can not viewed without the lens of what you are supporting. Just as you shouldn't buy conflict diamonds, I would argue you shouldn't buy ""conflict movies"" Skip this one, borrow it from a friend, or torrent it. Buy the book, if you want the story."
3,"Good story, well acted, well directed","But filled with very unsubtle statements about America plotting decades in advance to insert a CIA-controlled British PM in place for the Iraq-Afghanistan wars (because we saw that one coming, of course). Well, take it for what it is. Anti-American propaganda directed by a man who has been a fugitive from American justice for over 30 years. Disappointing to see Liam Neeson involved in this; we love his Long Way motorcycles movies.But you notice that I can be honest about the quality of the movie -- I'm able to keep my head screwed on straight even when I disagree with someone. Let hope others will display the same courtesy when reviewing conservative movies, books, etc."
2,Wasted potential,"The initial story-telling, and set-up are there - if a bit hackneyed - but it all falls apart into the most predictable and pathetic pay-off. It's an even less plausible ""Manchurian Candidate"". The sad thing is, there is no doubt good cinematic territory to be exploited from the relationship between the U.S. and the UK of recent. But Mr Polanski reduces it all to the most laughable of far left-wing European conspiracy theories. Snooze. The most entertaining part thus becomes listening to Kim Cattrall fall in and out of her very bad English accent."
3,"What goes up, must come down...","If this movie were a nice, single-malt whisky I'd review it as follows:Nose: dried orange peel, dark chocolate, wild cherry with a hint of peat.Taste: full-bodied and almost chewy, clings to the palate.Finish: Wait? What? No finish???It all starts out very promising. From the very first minutes the movie draws you near. You find yourself IN the story, wondering what will happen next. Even though the pace is quite slow, it's never boring.Then suspense is built up, and up, and up... And then when you expect a grand finale... Suddenly the credits start rolling and you're left with a hollow feeling, thinking: ""Wait... That's it???""Therefore: 3 stars. Could've been 4 or 4 1/2 with a better ending."
1,Stay away if you don't like buying edited content.,I thought the movie wasn't too bad but I really would like to know when I'm buying edited content. Next time I'll read more reviews before I purchase.
3,The book was better,"A good film, but I must say the book was 10 times better. The movie is too obvious. (No spoilers)"
2,"thin effort, not much there except a great house on the beach","Ok acting. Thin plot. I never got this movie, and it wasn't really suspenseful or entertaining, or much of anything. There's a ghost writer for memoirs who goes to a beautiful house on the beach where his subject lives. The writer isn't the first in this job and his predecessor died, probably was murdered. By whom, and why? There's a mystery around that and the tension lies in the writer, who isn't an investigative reporter, acting like he is one except that he seems to have not an ounce of common sense considering the situation. I didn't really care about any of the characters as I didn't really learn much about any of them. Kim Cattrell seemed to do a good job in a fairly minor role that was reminiscent of Kim Novak in a Hitchcock movie."
2,Atmospheric but Dumb,"Ghostwriter gets a few points for its acting and locale, but there are so many clunky plot quirks that the effect is ultimately spoiled. Worst is the notion that a supposedly ""intelligent thriller"" hinges on the belief that the CIA will happily kill anyone who gets in their way, and that rendition of terrorists is an obvious and universally recognized war crime. We are also apparently supposed to assume that anyone involved with Halliburton is eeevil (Daily Kos readers will love this flick).It hardly helps that the source of all this anti-US moralizing is a director who is avoiding trial in the US for sexual assault. I guess rendition is too much like extradition?Add to all that the lack of any clear reason for the main protagonists to act the way they do, and an incredibly dumb resolution to the ""mystery"" (hint: it involves Googling a person's name. Who would ever have thought of doing that?). It all adds up to a very nave thriller."
2,Nonsense,"I just don't understand how the director of ""The Pianist"" could possibly have directed this. First, it's pure nonsense to have James Bond in an intellectual dual with Obi-Wan Kenobi.There are other bits of nonsense in this book. Americans don't care about Brits, and certainly don't care about the Hague -- so the idea of an ex British PM indicted for war crimes and that causing a media firestorm within America is absolutely ridiculous. Also, America doesn't need to insert a CIA spy within the British administration to tell the Brits what to do -- the Brits are more than happy to follow the Americans anyway. Then there's the ghost writer -- ghost writers are so because they have no thoughts of their own -- otherwise they would just be writers!Roman -- seriously? I know you don't like the Americans, but this movie is just drivel."
2,"Long, Boring, and Highly Improbable -","The plot in this movie centers around a former U.K. Prime Minister who's being accused of war crimes for supporting U.S. renditions and torture activities. He's also believed by some to be a U.S. puppet. The ghost writer is brought in to finish editing a book about the former P.M. after his predecessor mysteriously dies. An accidental find of old photos, a bit of probing here and there, and eventually we learn that the P.M. had been recruited by the CIA and was in fact a U.S. puppet. In between we encounter a few chase scenes and a tryst between the P.M.'s estranged wife and the writer.Extremely improbable, from the very beginning until the ending. Also quite slow-moving and boring."
3,O.k. product,"This product is a good basic look at feelings, but I wish there was an ability to add more personalization to each emotion or blank pages that the student/child could complete themselves. Good book for beginners or younger students that you are working on emotions with."
5,The QUEEN has done it again.,Elton has done a wonderful job on this follow up CD to Captian Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy.If you are even a little bit of a fan you will enjoy this CD.
3,"Great lyrics, soft music",I bought this cd a few weeks ago. When I first listened to it I thought it was pretty good but that was it. It never did grow on me like it has for other people. I actually don't blame Elton or Bernie for this fact. They both do a great job here. Very worthy of there 70's output. My gripe here is Davey Johnson. His guitar work here is very substandard for him. His guitar work has always been what gives Eltons songs there kick. And here it sounds like he just came in and did it by the numbers. I think that it's actually very sad. Elton's voice on this sounds even better than Songs From The West Coast which I would give 5 stars to. In my opinion this really could have been a classic. Nice try guys but at least it is better than the 80's and 90's stuff. For my money buy SFTWC from a few years ago. That was really Elton and Bernies comeback CD. Great music all the way through.
2,another mild let-down from Sir Elton,"I consider Sir Elton to be our modern-day Mozart, but after the brilliant ""songs from the west coast"", this album is, in my opinion, a disappointment just like ""peachtree road"" was. Both are relatively uninspired, at least to my ears. At least there is a lot of Elton's wonderful piano playing, but the songwriting is mediocre, lacking any modern Elton classics like ""boy in the red shoes"" or ""love her like me."""
3,Only EJ fans will enjoy this album,"As soon as I heard this CD was out I dashed out to buy it. I have listened to it twice now. I have to say that only Elton fans will enjoy these songs. There's little pop value to any of these songs and they will not appeal to the masses. Elton fans will enjoy these songs because they can easily relate to them. I doubt ""The Bridge"" will do very well as a single. I'm ready for Elton to let go of the past and make imspired music again. Yes, he's 59 now but he is still very talented. Although his voice isn't what it used to be. To Elton and his legion of fans the 70s are over and please start making songs that will appeal to today's generation and your older fans. This album ranks with Peachtree Road as another let down for me. A better album is Songs from the West Coast. I gave this CD 3 stars because it's average. I was hoping for a little Elton magic but he sings like a man whose retiring and has been put out to pasture."
3,No 'Porch Swing in Tupelo',"The first album I ever bought was ""Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy"", and was very much looking forward to this release, especially coming on the heels of ""Peachtree Road"" (which I gave a solid 5 stars).Having listened now at least 10 times, I find the first three songs totally forgettable ('Noah's Ark' does not hold a torch to 'Tower of Babel') The balance are very, very solid but nothing to sing in the shower. These are all boigraphical songs, so maybe it is best that this time I have to just shut up and listen. As a pianist who plays way too much Elton, I do not see this as derivative of earlier works as others have stated, just lacking in the freshness and attack of its namesake. No ""riff from God"" on any of these numbers, but the 'Captain Fantastic' reprise in piano this time instead of guitar had me heading straight for the keyboard..."
5,Awesome!,"This is without doubt Elton & Bernie's best effort since The original Capt. Fantastic. Because they set such high standards in the 70's, everthing since their hey day has had trouble living up to those expectations, when infact, Elton has put out many quality albums since, including but not limited to Too Low For Zero, Breaking Hearts, The One, Made in England, Songs from the West Coast and now The Captain and the Kid. Maybe not the Elton of 1970 - 1976, but still better and more meaningful than just about anyone out there today. Keep it up guys and thanks for 36 years and counting."
4,retro-elton,"I think the Scissor Sisters resurrected the spark of Elton John from the 70's, and this is the result; a left over portion of ""the Brown Dirt Cowboy"". This follow-up misses the intensity of the previous, but it has a nice sell out quality that Elton John is known for. Perhaps he should have spent more time in the studio with Scissor Sisters to revive the real classic sounds that Elton has always been known for. Not a bad album, and any Elton fan will agree. It just lacks the punch expected as a sequel."
3,One good song,"I expected more after all the hype regarding this CD's release. I love Elton and Bernie and have enjoyed their music through the years, so I was a little disappointed with this CD, I think I expected so much more. I will not be listening to this one over and over"
5,in great form,"best i've heard from elton and bernie in a long time. great lyrics, music, and arrangements. elton's voice is perfect. here's to old '67!"
3,Not as good as I thought it would be.,"I went to see Elton in concert. That's why I bought the CD. He played many of the songs on the new CD and they sounded good. When I got the CD, they just didn't sound as good. I've only listened to the CD once, so maybe, given time, the songs would grow on me. But I think the fact that I only listened once, tells you what I thought of it, which is weird, because I am a huge fan of Elton John."
4,From Captain Fantastic & the Brown Dirt Cowboy ............,"As was CFBDC so is the Captain and the Kid an autobiographical production so is this CD. Long time EJ fan and this is a nice way to reminisce. Although I feel EJ's voice isn't what it use to be, if you enjoy and appreciate him and Bernie, this is a must have."
3,Good Effort From Lord Choc Ice,"Overall, some very pleasant songs...especially the title track, ""Wouldn't Have You Any Other Way,"" and ""Tinderbox."" A collection of very stripped-down instrumentation with some catchy melodies. Although this is not the ""Elton"" of old, it is still better than anything currently released on the pop/rock front. It is sometimes hard to listen to Elton's lower vocal range since I grew up listening to his beautiful falsetto in the 70's and early 80's. I just wish on Elton's next album he would do some more up-tempo music (an album you can dance to). I would also love to see Bernie do another Farm Dogs album.But back to this CD...some classic EJ/BT tunes interspersed with some forgettable ones. This is his best album since ""Made In England."""
4,Flashes of the old Captain Fantastic,"The Captain and the Kid is Elton John's best album in years... From the first track, you can enjoy flashes of Elton's genius again in his happy, honky-tonk piano playing. He again turns water into wine with Taupins often clunky lyrics... Like a stopped watch though, each of the 10 songs on this album contain two interesting ideas, which is enough, I guess, for Elton to fashion a melody around. For me the highlights are those songs that SOUND like they could have been recorded during Elton's glory days (1972 to 1978), which are ""Post Cards from Richard Nixon"", ""I Wouldn't Have You Any Other Way (NYC)"", ""Tinderbox"", ""The House Fell Down,"" and ""The Captain and the Kid"". The quiet songs on the albums are lifeless, and again call more attention to Taupins often silly-sounding lyrics. Five entertaining songs on One album, is worth it, to me. I've had the album playing in my car for 5 weeks and counting. But I'm a big Elton John fan."
3,Elton is running out of steam.,"I'm a huge Elton John fan, and consider Captain Fantastic to be one of his finest acheivements. This album fails big time to capture the energy and sonic exloration of that album. I was hoping that after Peachtree Road (a MUCH better album than this one), that Elton had tapped into some kind of creative epiphone from his past. Unfortunately, this is just more AOR snoozers from a dried out pop star. Maybe it's time for Elton to hang up his hat and quit playing his fans. But I guess he's doing what he wants . . . a priveledge Elton has earned. Just don't buy this album thinking it's going to be a brilliant revisit to the original. It' not. Not even close. Get Peachtree Road, it's much more like the Elton of old."
1,The Captain and the Kid Fall,"Like most Elton John fans, I have waited and waited for the Captain and the Kid to make a comeback. It's finally happened, and this CD is a big disappointment. There's nothing exciting happenening here and my 2 closest friends who have also been waiting, are also disappointed. I played the CD twice--the second time was to see if I was just missing something. I wasn't. I won't be playing it again. John & Taupin, thanks for years of waiting---for nothing."
3,We still love you Elton,"Just saw Elton John in concert last night and he was great. It is his Captain and the Kid tour and he only sang two songs from this CD. That should tell you how much he is promoting it and what he thinks of these songs. He sang that first song about Richard M. Nixon which is so lame and the last song about the Captain and the Kid which is above average. I would say this CD is the weakest of the last three. West Coast is a 5, Peachtree Road a 4, and The Kid a 3. For the life of me I can't ever figure out why Bernie Taupin doesn't write a lyric that says something worth saying...it just sounds good to sing. Take me to the Pilot, Rocket Man, Crocadile Rock, ect. he sang all of these last night. The Captain and the Kid will fade away, but we still love Elton."
5,Sir or Queen Elton did it again,"Whatever we call him, he is a true artist. His brilliant work brings so much to all his fans. I have loved Elton's music for more than 20 years. I have almost all his albums, and he is such a wonderful artist. When I first heard of Captin and the Kid I thought oh my what kind of music is that. I loved the Peachtree Road album, which brought his 70's style to blend with the current days music. I played that album for my friends mom and she loved it, she asked me whom the artist was and I said Elton John, she said no way. That doesn't sound like his stuff - ya know Rocketman, Benny and the Jets, etcera. I also loved made in England, and Love Songs.Elton is one of few versitile song writers and singers in the industry today, I enjoy Captain and the Kid just like all his other brillant albums. Elton we love you. You are so awesome."
2,"""I'm 58 & I don't care...""...well THAT shows!","After reading just a handful of the over 100 reviews, I find myself in the minority...I really, really, don't like this album, except for ""Just Like Noah's Ark"". I was disappointed, for after ""Songs from the West Coast"" and ""Peachtree Road"" I thought he was returning to his old sound. Up to this point, I felt his worst efforts were ""Victim of Love"" and ""Empty Sky"" (except for 'Skyline Pigeon'). I feel, while this may not be his worst, it's definitely loitering just above the bottom of the barrel. While he is my all-time favorite artist (I have all of his albums except for 'Aida'), I'm not sure he'll ever hit the top again. His voice is much deeper, I'll never get used to his hair weave, and lately he seems to be known more for negative publicity than for his music. At the same time, I don't want him to retire. I bought this just after its release, but I guess I'll just have to listen to it many more times in hopes of finding a bright spot."
2,Nothing In Common With the Original,"As with all things ""art"" this is a personal opinion so please don't take offence. If you were anticipating something approaching the fire and originality of Elton John's earlier works you will likely be disappointed. This material is weak and watered down to the point of being contrived. Anything resembling rock and roll has been efficiently neutered out including Davey Johnston's guitar that was so relevant in the original Captain Fantastic. If you were hoping for more ""Songs from the West Coast"" this disc might appeal. Otherwise, the reference to the original classic is unfounded if not outright deceitful."
2,"So much promise, little delivered","Nup, sorry, not what they said it would be. I had high hopes for this release which arrived today, but 55min later (a short film I might add) I walked away having eaten a steak well done when I ordered rare. The concept of this coming-of-age drama is fine but the acting - so,so - the script - unsatisfying - and the ending - weak. I know how it was 'meant' to end but it didn't deliver the impact I would have expected. So, as mentioned, great story but poorly delivered. I was looking forward to this one sooo much, oh well. By the way, the transfer is 5/10 for quality, shame, as this also detracted from my viewing pleasure..."
3,Like A Brother,"I gave the rating I did because the movie wasn't quite what I was expecting.The movie was interesting to watch, and I had to see it through to the end to find out what happened to the main character. The actors speak French, with English subtitles. Half of the m ovie was a flashback of sorts, with what I interpretted as Zack telling his story to his boyfriend Bruno. It's like a coming of age story about Zack who finds his way in the world. It wasn't what I expected because I thought that Zack and Roman ended up together at the end, and they didn't. But I was glad Zack found Bruno though. :)I would recommend this story to the naturally curious, but I would probably rent it first before purchasing to make sure it's something you'd like to watch again. I will watch it again, but not for a while. ;)"
2,Movie moved at a snail's pace !,The plot unfolds VERY SLOWLY. Only the couple of twists at the end made it a little good. Wish I had my money back !
1,Not waste your money,"The acting is okay, but ending leaves you wondering what the point of the movie was. I wouldn't waste my money of this film."
3,if you had a crush on a friend,this is a basic coming out and self discovery of ones seexuality and how a crush on a straigh best friend makes you have to move from them to find one self
3,Good but weak,"This is in my opinion one of the weakest releases ever by Mr.Pollard.It is way to slow paced to get me going. The songs are nice but they lack catchy hooks and refrains. ""Come Outside"" is probably the best track"
5,Holiday Best by The Blenders,One of the best singing groups that we have been listening to for the past five years. I have both albums (The Nog) also. I bought these for my daughters to keep to remember of their past Christmas years at home.
3,Okay Cd,The group is okay but not my favorite. Their selections are familiar but the arrangements are not always the way I like to hear the music sung.
2,Sentimental and Weak Language,"Within the Song to Live is a beautifully crafted book, with excellent production values, and attractive Hebrew and English type. Unfortunately the poems within do not match the fine tuned quality of the physical book. Both in Hebrew and English, Yonatan's poems are sentimental and lack any bite. Technically they may be fine poems; the Hebrew is accomplished in a formal way. But overall his poems fail to present human emotion in any novel way. There is nothing new here. This collection fails to provide the reader with any visceral sense of what poetry is about: The primal hunch of something moving which we sense but can not fully understand."
4,Clemenza,"The recording is exceptionally good and clear and I cannot understand to what the last reviewer is referring.The cast is strong and Janet Baker is first rate. Any reservation would be about the cast, only because we all have our favourites. For the price you can't go wrong!"
2,Poor Sound Quality,"Although ""Clemenza"" is a great opera, the sound quality of this CD is poor. It's been recorded live in London, but with old tech, which means you can hear voices and coughs from the audience.I have looked for a Clemenza CD, but only found this one. If you want to listen to this opera its ok (any Mozart music is brilliant), but if you are searching for a great version, try looking for another version. Please, if you find one, email me! :-) (Thanx!)"
4,VERY VERY VERY SMALL,Please be forewarned this car seat is very small. I originally bought it for my six year old but was so disappointed in the size i am giving it to my 18 month old niece is expecting a little sister This toy should be recommended for children 3 and under any older and the toy will be toooo small for them. But overall the toy is okay but the size is tooo small for the age they reccommend.
1,Potential Buyers Beware...,"I bought this doll for my daughter as well as my niece for Christmas. The picture of the doll clearly shows that the doll is African-American, there is no description to confirm this obvious fact, but it is obvious that this particular doll is African-American. I recieved the dolls nearly 2 weeks after I ordered them and to my suprise both dolls are Caucasian. I am furious because none of the TRU stores in my area carry the elusive African-American doll, and I was elated to find one online. I say to all shoppers, Beware if you're looking for an African-American doll then keep looking b/c this one is not."
5,interesting info on the breed,I own a Karelian and just love her. The author knows her stuff and loved the pictures too. A must for those that are fortunate to own a dog like these.
3,Not what I expected,"I was expecting details to learn more about this breed. This book is just a nice story about the dogs, and seems more geared towards children. I have had fun reading this book to my child under five, and my one year old loves the pictures. If you are considering owning this breed and want to learn about this breed, this is not the book."
5,Buying SARK? Buy this.,"I have been a huge SARK fan for as long as I can remember, and have read and enjoyed all her marvellously and divinely coloured works.So, as much as I am inspired by her and the work she has done, I honestly believe that her earlier works are much more relevant, beautiful and divine than her latter ones. While I would absolutely recommend that everyone purchase a copy of 'Eat Mangoes Naked' and other titles, I can't help but tire slightly of her SARK font, when her actual writing was one of the most delicious parts about her books. I guess I feel that the true beauty of SARK is so much more accessible within her earlier works, such as this, whereas the latter ones are undoubtedly that much more commericalised and repetitive.Along with 'Living Juicy', I believe that this is the best of the lot. The stories are absolutely divine and inspiring, the drawings and colours vulnerable and lovable.What a truly life-changing find this work is."
5,Yes! We Are Free!,"I love this book. I'm going through a very, very difficult loss and the last thing I wanted was an upbeat book. But without realizing it, I became transformed into a world of possibility and fun. Read and cherish this book."
5,This book is inspiring! GO and spread JOY,"This book really opens your mind on the world around you and the fun you can have with it. After reading it i felt compelled to go out and be happy, make myself and others happy. I felt renewed and inspired to be myself and be the best person i can be. If you read this book, be prepared to encounter questions, anwsers and ideas. It's pages are filled with good ideas and stories, whether with plot or without. The book really made me feel better about myself and everything. GO AND SPREAD JOY!"
4,Inspiration Sandwich: Stories to Inspire Our Creative Freedom,"If your creativity is at a standstill, Sark's Inspiration Sandwich is the needed ingredient to get those creative juices flowing once again. Very helpful."
4,SARK IS SO COOL!,"I loved this book. I read it in a couple hours. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was too short. If you didn't like it, try reading ""Succulent Wild Woman"" instead. It's my favorite Sark book and I promise you'll love it!"
2,Some good inspiration but...,"There are some meaningful messages in the book. But overall I felt the author was not bringing anything new to the table except hard-to-read doodles. She makes herself sounds like a former lazy bum who is now getting rich off doodling and painting. How nice. The doodles and handwriting really mask the message the book is supposed to convey. But hey, it's a shtick."
5,Great whisk,"My Norwegian mother-in-law always used this type of whisk to make gravy. I couldn't find it in the stores, but was thrilled to find it on Amazon. It works perfectly for whisking the bottom of the pan and to prevent burning. Bought one for each of my kids too!"
3,A little bigger than i expected,"A little bigger than I expected, but the design still works great! I just wish it were a little smaller to give room for wisking in smaller sauce pans."
5,Norpro Krona Whisk,I loved this. My mother had one from years and years ago which was smaller. But I really liked this sizee and the nice long handle. Just perfect for making my gravy. May order another one because you can't find these in stores around here.
5,"If you enjoy breathing and eating, you'll like this album","A breath of fresh air in the mine shaft of today's pop, Brookman's work reminds one of the days when they wrote SONGS, not ""tracks,"" while remaining wholly original and new. Comparable to everything and nothing at the same time, one of these songs would be a revealation, but here there are a dozen tunes which build on one another like a series of cascading epiphanies. If, after the first listening, you don't play this album again immediately, then either you weren't paying attention or you have unexpectedly expired. Get it quick before it becomes an overpriced collector's item."
5,The Best TI Card You will ever See!,"... I build PC's for a living (high end ones) -- mostly for games. So I better know what I'm talking about--Right? Ok, This card Needs a picture on Amazon tot do the CArd justice--It's a beautiful blue color on the PCB (board), and has the coolest bright chrome colored heat sink on it, totally nothing like it on any other TI card...and It overclocks better than Asus, Gainward, Visiontek (out of business--so beware of that company), and all others I have tried--which is why I use this card XFX TI4200 as the staple videocard for my budget gaming machines. I have OC'ed this card to 300/695 without any screen artifacts, that is stunning. So all Amazon.com needs to do is put up the picture of this great card, and it will sell. It has a nice price - and is T H E very best TI4200 money can buy"
4,Cute!,"Super adorable, made for babies but it was adorable for me. I'm 20 and it's not too flashy it's just right."
4,A great man,"The journal of an extraordinary gentleman, one of the greatest actors ever to grace stage or screen. His reflections on his career are moving and perceptive, totally lacking in self-aggrandisement. His thoughts on the whole ""Star Wars"" phenomenon are particularly witty but smack of the desperation of being hounded by that film's fans. It's tragic that this great man may only be remembered by modern generations for his appearance in that opus instead of for his work in the Ealing comedies, ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", his lengthy stage career and his magnificent turn on TV as George Smiley."
1,Damaged and missing bottles,"Despite reading several comments about poor packaging leading to busted bottles, I went ahead and ordered this. When I got home and saw the obviously very wet package by my front door, I knew I should have headed their warnings. I'm an Amazon fiend, and for the most part Amazon does a fantastic job with packaging. This was definitely not the case here. Not only did one bottle have a crack in that made a huge mess in the box, only 8 bottles were shipped vice the 9 as described! Returning these was quite the pain as I obviously couldn't use the box they were shipped in. I'll stick to the local mega-mart for laundry detergent from now on."
4,Good unscented product,"I've used this product for a while now. It works okay for cleaning, and none of us break out from it or choke on a fragrance.If you sign up for the automatic shipping (Super Savers, I think it's called) program, you get free shipping and a discount, so the price works out to around $4.75 per bottle. In the area where I live, that's only a few cents higher than I would pay at the store, and I get the added bonus of never running out. We live out in the country, and the local stores don't carry this often, so it's worth the extra few cents to me to keep my unscented detergent on hand. Now if Amazon would only carry the unscented Downy, which they currently don't..."
5,Simmer ring,"I love this item. It really works unlike the so-called simmer setting on my stove. Great for soups, sauces, melting chocolate, etc. without burning."
3,Be Careful !!,"This gadget is okay, but keep the heat down. I used mine on high heat and it looks trashed."
2,safety hazard,The first time I used the Simmer Ring to cook soup the handle started smoldering and heated up.Heat conducted all the way to the handle and could have started a fire.
2,Not quite,"This probably would have been fine if it had arrived in better packaging, without the dents."
5,"Cheap, simple, and WORKS GREAT!","I have a ceramic cooktop (would prefer gas and a line has been run in the basement for ""someday"") but you can only turn these burners so low. I like to make cooked-half-a-day bolognese sauce without having to stir it every 10 to 15 minutes to keep it from scorching. The flame tamer makes this possible. I can go outside and do some gardening or anything else I want to do and do not have to worry about my sauce at all. Theoretically, could even alleviate the need for a double boiler with some dishes. Great for any dish that you wish to keep heat just below simmer.PS Like other reviewer, Paul, I don't care about the handle, nor will I once I get my gas cooktop. Like him, I'll just let it burn off if it must and leave the diffuser on the burner til it cools ...hee hee."
4,Still works even after I set it on fire.....,"yes, I did accidently set it on fire. But it works just like its supposed to. If you have a gas stove, you may need to offset it a little because the handle will ignite."
3,Be cautious of handle!,The diffuser part worked out okay but the handle scorched from the heat and now I am leary of using them.
1,Not really necessary,I bought this thing to go with a bodum stove top coffee maker as it was recommended to keep the glass away from the naked flame. If you want to spend 30 mins waiting for water to boil with a smoking handle then this is a great product. Threw it away after the first use and for a year and a half I've used my bodum directly over the flame with no issues. Don't buy this thing. It is a product created for a problem that doesn't exist!
2,M S Lee,"Works, but very cheap! Wood handles caught on fire the first time they were used. Only haved used them once so far, don`t know how long they will last."
3,cheap at best,The only problem is the wooden handle is starting to char on the inside from use. The handle keeps falling off. Bad design to have wood so clse to a hear source.
4,Romance and Intrigue,"LADY VENGEANCE opens with the beautiful American Celia Tregaron waiting in the bedroom of the Earl of Ashmore. However, she is not there for the usual reasons.Celia thinks Marcus, the British Earl, is responsible for the death of her brother Ethan during the war of 1812, and has a loaded gun pointed at a, well, delicate area. Celia soon discovers she was about to murder the wrong man, which is fortunate because there is an instant attraction between the Earl and his would-be assassin.Marcus, at the promptings of his eccentric family, offers to aid Celia in her quest to find her little brother still alive somewhere in England. They are in for a rough ride through the British countryside - dodging bullets, exposing plots, and, of course, lots of juicy love-making."
3,Tiniest Pinata Ever,This pinata is very detailed. Its cool and may be good for a party with just a few kids but its about the size of a hemet you would put on to wear. I bought it off another website without measurements but just be warned-its small.
2,Horrible design,"This pinata came apart of the very first light tap at my son's birthday party. There were 7 other kids anxiously awaiting their turn to hit it, so we used some duct tape to put it back together and carried on. After 3-4 more duct tape surgeries, we were able to allow all the kids to hit it. Was it fun? Absolutely! But, it really needs a better design. The helmet separates from the rest of the head incredibly easily. Another friend of mine had one and it separated when they hung it up (before anyone even hit it). I still think this is a fun item for a Star Wars themed party, but be prepared for it to come apart quickly."
2,a better mask...,"I bought this pinata for my sons 5th birthday. He, being the birthday boy, went first. He hit it once and it broke open. It was the quickest pinata ever. The kids had a great time playing with the helmet after, in fact he still has it as part of his Darth Vader costume, so that was cool, but as a pinata, not so much."
4,Darth Vader Pinata,This Darth Vader pinata was a lot of fun. It looks great and holds up well when the kids take a swing at it! It could be a bit more durable around the hole where you insert candy... but that's pretty much it!Loved it!
4,Hard to break open,"I was so excited to find this for my daughters ""star wars"" party. We used a toy lightsaber as a beating stick. The kids loved it, but it took forever to break. All 30 kids got a chance to hit it though, so it worked out well."
4,So cool,We got this for our son's second birthday. It is well made and looks really cool. The only down side is I thought it would be bigger.
2,"Looked great, horrible as a pinata","The pinata looked great, but is very poorly designed. It's made in two parts and the bottom part which holds the candy busted off on the very first solid hit and the fun was all over."
1,Not Worth It!,If I had video of this I would show you how aweful it was. This pinata is not durible at all if you use it as a hitting pinata...I was informed upon purchase that it could be used as either and there is a little panflit connected to the pinata when you get it that tells you the same. I did not try it as a pull string pinata so if you are interested in this for that reason it might be more profitable to read other reviews.
2,Weak,"This pinata was the worst I've ever had. I always have a pinata each year for both of my boys. I filled it up, picked it up and it immediately broke into two pieces. It appeared that the top was just held together by regular staples and a small amount of glue. Lucky for me I have a boyfriend who is crafty. He spent a couple of hours and was able to sew the two pieces together using a long funiture needle. I was really disappointed in this pinata."
1,no good,"my son was obsessed with star wars for this past 7th birthday. I thought I would suprise him with this. I did not realize that the kids woudl have to go up one by one and pull on a string to release the candy, but we didn't even get that far. as we were hanging the pinta up, it fell apart and there was no way to save it so all the kids didn't get a chance to do anything with it. just swarmed to the ground for their treasure. i was very dissapointed."
2,Don't buy this (unless you LOVE condensed matter physics),"Ok, ok, my title seems a little aggressive, but trust me, if you are looking for a *computational physics* (C.P.) book, this is not a good choice. I have been lecturing an introductory computational physics course for two years, and, by far, the most adequate books I found (and use) were Giordano & Nakanishi and Landau & Páez ones. Dr. Thijssen's book is highly concentrated on condensed matter physics, and it has *too few* graphics, figures, or illustrations. In my sincere opinion, is by far the worst book on C.P. I have bought, and I do not recommend it, at least for those who want to learn C.P. ""from scratch"". Ok, ok, it can be considered a ""high level"" book (maybe adequate for graduate courses), but I think that it lacks the main points on ""pure"" C.P. The reason for the two stars is because I am a condensed matter physicist, and therefore the book will at least serve as an additional reference on this subject."
4,"Nice, but not for everyone","I really like this book. But it's not for everyone. If you already have a decent background in scientific computing and physics, and are looking to expand your knowledge in some of the areas covered in the book, then it's a great buy.In my opinion, the (few) code examples aren't particularly nice and the discussion of numerical methods is not very sophisticated. But what you do get is an ""easy"" introduction to a variety of interesting (advanced) topics. With ""easy"" I mean easier than trying to read specialized literature on your own, because most of the book is not very easy. It is not overly complicated either.To enjoy the book, the requirements on your physics background are a bit higher than on your scientific computing skills. (Say at least a bachelor in physics compared to a few programming courses.)"
3,No ball included!,You'll need a ball if you order this. I didn't even open the DVD so I don't know anything about the DVD content itself.
3,Lame Video,"The workout ball is good for abs, but the video workout is for someone who has never worked out before in there life."
4,9/11?,"Anyone notice this album was released on September 11th, 2001? Hmm...maybe they should change their name to Thievery Corporation. Wait, no - that's what the White House should change their names to. Just kidding, kind of. Good album - very chill. Nice ambiance and sound mixing. Makes me remember 9/11. Check it out."
5,Awesome cap for kids,"My son loves the Detroit Tigers and this hat is very well made, and at a great price."
1,Picture and Description Don't Match,"From the Product Description:""All hems and seams are double-stitched Washable and reusable 4' x 15' 6 oz medium weight Carded""Note 6 oz. weight in above description. Of course, the picture shows 8 ounce. Hoping that the written description was accurate, I went ahead with the order for a non-painting project because I didn't have time to order elsewhere, and 6 ounce canvas is not easy to find.Upshot, of course, is that I received 8 oz. canvas and had to use it even though it wasn't the ideal weight.My real beef is with the quality of the hem stitching, which was very poor. I had to have the hems re-sewn. I don't care to leave negative reviews, but this product earns it."
5,Always enjoyable,"Written and or illustrated by James Marchall equals a special experience. ""Fox Outfoxed"", is a wonderful presentation of an older brother. All age children may enjoy the books. It doesn't hurt to have a lesson mixed in with smiles. He cheats in a go cart race, loses by pretending to not be as he is, and shows he is both a young child and caring brother."
4,good book,"My book is called Fox Outfoxed. The mane characters are Fox, Louse, Carmen, Dexter and they are wanting to win a race and the race was in the afternoon. They were doing the race outside to have fun. I think fox Fox Outfoxed is a good book because it is about some animals that sometimes have adventures and go to school. That's why I think it is a good book. And I would recommend this to my sister, Katie, because she likes animals and there are lots of animals in the book. By Matthew Z."
4,Beautifully written tale of tragedy,"Poststructuralist claptrap notwithstanding, the structure of this book is perfect for its intended purpose; to explore the psychology of a dramatic and tragic event from the perspective of several of its participants. Told quickly about the central event, each successive pass brings you closer, allows you to feel the depth and inevitability and to experience both its attraction and revulsion until you arrive at the brilliant depiction of the tunnel vision of coping and performing ordinary tasks under extreme stress. I found this book hard to read precisely because it is well written, the characters vividly drawn and the events all too plausible. And in the end you understand; all of the pieces fall into place, but to what purpose? Is the cost of your enrichment really worth it, or is your attempt to derive meaning from pain convincing in the end?This book is in the same class as ""The Bonesetter's Daughter"" in terms of a fine portrayal of individuals and cultures."
3,Interesting but repetitive,"I read this book as a requirement for a professional development teaching course called ""The Literature of Immigration."" I found this book to be thought provoking within the first half, but considered the ending somewhat redundant. The style and structure of the book is symbolic because it is much like the title, Bone, a nice tactic used by Fae M. Ng. Overall the protagonist, Leila, is a very annoying character because she has no figurative back bone. The whole time reading this, I realized I hated her because of her inability to stand up for herself and make decisions. My emotion over the book shows Ng's ability to engage the reader, but irritabilty does not make for a pleasurable read."
3,Quite a Timewarp,"Bone is a very effective story with dynamic characters (especially Leon). This book a good representation of Asian American Literature. What I didn't like about it was how Ng decided to present her story. Would it really have killed the author to tell the story in chronological order? This book's timeline was more confusing than Falkner's The Sound and the Fury. If you really work at it, you can eventually figure out the order of events. I didn't like was how the book concludes at a point in the near beginning of the storyline (before Ona's death). The conclusions that the main character comes to about her life had no impact on me because I knew that something devastating happens right afterwards that will inevitably alter Leila's opinion. Also, there are a few anacharisms in Ng's storyline, proving that the chopped up time frame even tripped her up a little."
1,not worth it,"I was expecting a well composed novel and ended up with a story instead. Have you ever been stuck on the telephone with a friend who insisted on reporting a personal story in a rambled manner while you have better things to do with your time? Or better yet, just get completely bored with the whole thing and hang up as quickly as possible? That's what I felt like while reading this novel. The composition of this novel was, at best, junior high level. And, to top it off, I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and was unable to conjure up any interest in her ongoing blah blah blah about what street she was walking or driving through. I think I'm going to take BART to the city and abandon the book somewhere in Chinatown."
3,"Good, but...","I really enjoyed the cultural aspects of this book--the descriptions of what it's like to experience America as a Chineese American, and how some of the traditions carry over, etc., but I didn't like way the book seemed to be centered around Ona's suicide (it didn't start that way, but about halfway through that's all you read about). I understand that the family was completely and irrevocably changed by her death, but I wish some of the other characters could have been better developed (especially Nina!)...It's not a bad book, just not my first choice..."
2,I didn't feel anything for this book.,"This book featured no character development, no sense of urgency with the characters. It was primarily a memory of past events by the narrator (a young Chinese-American woman) who is about to leave Chinatown; this memory told to the reader by way of inner monologue, and the recollections are as follows: One of her sisters has committed suicide, her step-dad runs up against bad luck trying to attain the American Dream, her living sister has ""escaped"" Chinatown to live in New York to work in the travel business; and, her mother has eyes for another man since she is left alone when the step-dad goes overseas occasionally on jobs as a seaman. Again, the book is the narrator looking back at what she is leaving behind, since we already know that she has made her decision to leave."
1,bone is too bare-bone,"Although there is authenticity in setting and movement, the characters are ultimately shallow and terribly one-dimensional. Mason and the narrator especially, have no depth or complexity. Potentially riveting issues are merely touched on, then forgotten, and bad lines such as ""Have yours first; I'll put Mason's in a jar for you to take,"" and ""Ona loved the love stories about the butterfly lovers,"" make me wonder how much time was actually spent revising and nurturing the author's ""poetic gift for metaphor."" I wanted to love this book, but I could barely bring myself to finish it."
3,has potential,"Whenever I read a book I ask myself whether it resonates with truth or credibility. I think this book does to a certain extent. I was able to identify with many aspects of the day to day life of this immigrant family. But what I found lacked substance were the characters themselves. As one reader noted, Mason is one-dimensional. I found this to be true of all the characters. Perhaps the father was the only one who seemed impassioned by anything. Even the mother's character was not fully developed. What motivated her to have an affair with the factory owner? The story line had potential, but it was meandering and I kept wondering where it was going and what was the point."
5,Good old big band music,"Ralph Flanagan in my opinion is second only to Glenn Miller in big band danceable music even though he never gained as much fame as some of the other bands of the era. The two bands, Miller's & Flanagan's, sound somewhat similar in style and both are great. Flangan's music always made you feel like dancing even if you didn't know how. The selections on this album are a fine example of his work"
1,bad toy,"none of the 3 received worked, it would have cost more to send them back than what they are worth"
5,Wonderful tea,"I LOVE this tea! Orange spice is one of my favorite flavors and Bigelow's version is I believe the best out there.Perfect for cool nights, to soothe with after a hard day, or as an excuse for cold hands. :)This is one item I absolutely must keep in stock at home. Heaven forbid I run out of my Orange and Spice! It'd be as much a travesty as a pub with no beer!!"
4,"A Calm, Dispassionate Description Of A Terrible Event","""57 Hours"" presents a valuable insight into something most us will never, thank heaven, have to endure - being taken hostage. Vesselin Nedkov (with Paul Wilson) has done a marvelous job of describing the basic events associated with the capture by Chechen fighters in 2002 of almost 800 Moscow theater-goers, actors, musicians, and others in the Russian musical production ""Nord-Ost"". Nedkov's story is told without any intense feeling of rancor against the Chechen hostage-takers or against the Russian forces who caused the deaths of so many of the very people they were trying to rescue. There is a lot of sadness in this book, but much hope, too, as well as the realization that among the majority of people who live lives of ""quiet desperation"" there is also a well of quiet heroism to draw upon. This is an engrossing story that is very well told. I certainly recommend this book."
3,"Some Good Music, and a Little Good Symphonic Music","This review is specifically about the 'cleanliness' of this Clean version of the Training Day soundtrack. If you are a father or mother, or would like to avoid having to hear cursing yourself, you may wish to know that the editing of this disc ranges from just okay to pretty poor.Among others words that should have been removed but remain in the songs anyway include one blasphemy, a**, h***, and d***, plus several times a lyric with the 'f' word in it (or mother f******) is edited to remove the last letters, while leaving the sound of the 'f'--i.e., your mind thinks the word anyway. What's up with that? How is that clean as advertised?I solved these problems by ripping the disc's songs as WAV files on my computer and editing the offending tracks better. But I shouldn't have to do that.Just a word to the wise for those who care."
4,Great when I can't brush with a toothbrush,"My dentist gave me a sample pack of the Brush-Ups, so I took some on a plane trip the next day. I really like them! I had some snacks on the plane and really wanted to brush afterwards but couldn't - then I remembered I had these so I got a pack out and voila - my teeth felt clean for the rest of the flight. They don't take the place of brushing of course, but when I can't brush they make my mouth feel a lot better than gum or nothing would!"
3,Meh...,"While this product does freshen your breath & get the overall gunk off, I have to say that unless you rinse your mouth out well beforehand you'll have gunk left in your teeth.I tried these over a 2 month period (I bought quite a few of them on sale) & I was underwhelmed. The first go-round I found little bits of gunk stuck in my teeth, which made me have to rinse my teeth out liberally afterwards & floss. After I rinsed my teeth out well beforehand, I had better results.I'd recommend these for when you want to get a bit of a fresher breath during work but haven't had a meal or anything. If you've drank some coffee & want to avoid the coffee stench afterwards, this is the thing for you. Otherwise you'd be better off just brushing & flossing as normal."
4,They hum,"Great speakers in general, except for the annoying hum when no audio is going through them."
3,"Incredible sound, but poor quality","Other reviews are right, these speakers sound incredible if properly hooked up to a decent sound card. The hum others experienced was probably because of improper hook-up. The down side to these speakers are in the construction. They are pathetically easy to blow, even at low volume levels. If you accedentally direct a little bass to the sattelites you are going to have a ruined speaker. It has happened to me twice so far."
4,Fantastic speakers! Easy to use! GREAT!!!,"These speakers are terrific! they are very easy to install, because the speaker jacks are not only color coded, but only certain speakers fit into certain jacks. The sound is great, but i warn you!!! i spent 3 hours trying to get a ""cracking, blowing"" sound when they played bass, but i found out that all you have to do is turn down the computer volume, and turn up the speaker volume on the speakers themselves, and this solved the problem. they are terrific speakers for the price, and i would suggest them to all my friends! my only complaint is that you can't completely turn the subwoofer off, but it's not a big problem. other than that, A++++. Oh, just fyi, these speakers sounded much better than the equal value creative speakers. If you don't believe me, just go to any best buy and try them out yourselves! A++"
2,So-so performance for a low price,"My ears are quite sensitive, so the audible hum the speakers produce when on but not playing music is extremely annoying. I can ignore the noise of the computer fans, but I cannot tune the hum out for some reason--perhaps subconsciously I just don't expect them from speakers, plus the noise is pretty harsh.The noise also submerges some of the finer details when playing music, especially at low volumes. It doesn't matter too much, since the detail level isn't high at all.I agree that these speakers are good for people who don't care much about music quality. The bass is strong, though, so if you like bass-heavy music and don't mind the hum and poor midrange/high-end, get these."
2,Very repetitive,My 4 1/2 year old played this game one time and found it pretty boring. I like the fact that is assesses their ability but the games are so repetitive. It doesn't have enough choices for them. I can't get him to play it again. We also have the Jumpstart game for Kindergarten and he is crazy about that one. I was hoping that the Reader Rabbit game would interest him as much based on what other reviewers said. He may have liked it better if we hadn't been playing the Jumpstart game already.
1,Does NOT work with Vista,This game does not work with Windows Vista. I have no idea if the game itself is good or not since we can't even load it.
4,Good for my 5 year old,"My grandson will be starting K soon. He likes the various choices and activities presented, some are more educational than others. My problem is that the format is not compatible with my newer Vista OS so he has to use it on my older computer with XP."
1,Please!,Do not buy this cheap item. I have purchased quit a few corsets and this is horrible. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!
2,"Fascinating Subject, Terribly Written","This is one of those books where interest in the subject drives you through it despite the poor presentation. The writing is juvenile and indulgent, and serves as caution to steer clear of the author's novel."
3,Snake handlers unite!,"I read this book and it was intersting, start to finish. My complaint is that it didn't really delve into more than the surface, really, of snake handling and the drinking of poison - where do these people get poison? They make it themselves? Out of what? How do they possibly survive? But: the book isn't supposed to be about all things snake handling, I suppose, and it is more about an author's journey into understanding. I would have liked to have read more about the author's family's views - including his wife who barely appears in the book."
4,An effortlessly interesting subject matter,"If the image of hollering, God-fearing folk handlng snakes in dingy,isolated church buildings, all against a backdrop of twangy sounds and summer heat attracts you, then this book should be read.For mine, the latter parts of the book, which focus on squabbles amongst the faithful, and the author's own excursion into his personal experiences, move away from what brought me to it in the first place - an examination of the character and life of a unique religious form.(Compare the very short section of snake handling in the novel Fried Green Tomatoes, or even the feeling captured in some of the decades old, origninal, recordings on the CD 'Mountian Music of Kentucky'). However, the book is well written in a 'New Yorker' kind of way, has a good pace and makes a good read."
3,"Entertaining, but not worth purchasing.","Read for a college Theology class. It's entertaining, but didn't hold my interest for long. I recommend borrowing it from a library--it's not worth purchasing. The subject in general, did not interest me."
2,Wasted my time.,"I read this book for a class. Except I couldn't accept this book as critical or objective. I found this to be a claptrap story, that was basically done for propaganda purposes. I honestly don't know why it is assigned at a university level. If I wanted more faith in anything, I'd think about it, not read about it.The book is sensational because the author is a journalist and knows how to make it fancy. I would recommen to the reader that if he wants to read it, he should go to the library, not the bookstore."
5,Very alive,"I found this book to be a powerful exploration of what is at once both a very simple and very complex faith. The trust that Covington describes is incomprehensible and wonderful; the absolute, unswerving faith in the midst of what is a very real, very evil world is amazing. Covington does an excellent job of presenting a portrait of something that has survived against the odds; what he describes is a world that some may have difficulty believing exists. The book is gripping and moving. It may be a challenge for a ""modern"" reader to fully understand this faith, but this novel is certainly an example of how anyone, even a seasoned reporter, can be moved by an old gas station, some rousing music, and a box of snakes."
3,Woody floral fragrance,"I wasn't really sure what Osmanthus was supposed to smell like, and I don't know if I'm sure now. I was expecting a floral scent, but I think this has more of a woody scent to it. In the box, it has a delightful fruity floral fragrance, but that does not come through when you burn it. Still, it is very nice and has no chemical smell to it, and if you like a more woody, spicy scent, this is a good quality Japanese stick which is packaged beautifully. My favorite in the Kayuragi line is the Wisteria, closely followed by Narcissus, both of which are pretty florals."
2,"So, so.","I found this product disappointing. It was not to the level of other Smooth Jazz CD's I own. The arrangement was mediocre, since within a particular CD everything sounded alike. I would recommend instead ""Oasis Smooth Jazz Awards Collection."" I wish I could find another one of that caliber. The arrangement on that one is absolutely great. Gret variety, great performers, great pieces. Please keep an eye that I am talking about the Oasis CD, not about This is Smooth Jazz. This is Smooth Jazz is not at all like that. Three CD, triple disappointment. I enjoyed about 3 pieces on the whole set. Buy the Oasis instead."
2,One-Chip Wonder?,"I installed two of these cards into one PC. One of them became inoperable after only about 9 months' use. Something curious that accompanied its demise was that its MAC address, as reported by ipconfig, had become (odd)."
5,Love this watch,"This watch is nice looking, can be worn for dress or casual. I like the light dial and numbers against the dark background on the face. Makes it easy to read without my reading glasses. The band was too big for me but I would not list that as a problem. I only mention it for those who have smaller wrists as I do about 6 inches. in diameter. Can be a problem when buying bracelets or watches. I brought it to a jeweler who resized it and it fits perfectly now."
2,Small band,"The watch is as pictured, but the band does not have much stretch, is difficult to get over the hand, and is very tight and uncomfortable on the wrist. I'm of average size (8-10), so when the description said ""Fits most wrists,"" I assumed that would include mine. I am very disappointed, because it is a lovely watch."
5,Different and Better,"I have reviewed, read and used practically hundreds of jazz methods and I can honestly say that NONE of them are like How to Improvise. Where other authors overly concern themselves with which scale to play on which chord or memorizing ii V I licks in every key, Crook teaches us how to play music.Each chapter deals with a different musical aspect such as pacing, phrase lengths, time, dynamics and articulation. There's a text description of each topic followed by a comprehensive regime of exercises dealing specifically with that topic.A lot of what's wrong with the jazz playing of young musicians could easily be fixed with this one book. I know it made a huge impact in my playing and my career. With Crook's book, I was able to take all of the technique I learned from other books and turn it into something people actually like to listen to. For that, I can't thank him enough."
5,A thorough guide to improvisation,"As a classically trained musician, jazz has been slow to reveal its secrets to me. I have enjoyed listening to it, but getting the hang of the jazz style in general and the art of improvisation in particular have been less enjoyable. However, the demands on musicians today makes it vital to have some understanding of all kinds of music, and this book is a great way to start your exploration of jazz. With a lot of short and well organized exercises, and a stress on learning to listen to what is happening, it tells the frustrated student how to master the mystery of making jazz happen. I know I have to work on the exercises to get where I want to, but the layout of this book makes it easy to organize my practice!"
4,Still timely,"Wondering if marijuana should be legalised? Or kept forbidden? Perhaps you have no strong feelings either way, but are interested in some neutral information that is reasonably well argued. You don't want a stridently ""anti"" screed, a la William [Reefer Madness] Bennett. Neither do you want something issued by a long time, zonked out, dreadlocked subscriber to High Times.Take a gander here. Kleiman analyses marijuana with a strong economic bent. He shows various supply-demand curves for it, treating it as a regular commodity, subject to classical economic analysis. He also looks similarly at drug enforcement effectiveness and various elasticities of demand.The book was published in 1989 and his data is thence from the 80s. Still timely. In parts of the US and elsewhere, there has been some slight easing of prohibition. But much of the status quo of the 80s remains, as though in a time warp.Kleiman also provides a comprehensive appendix. Useful if you want original sources."
4,One Day at a Time Therapy,"I bought this book for a friend of mine a few years ago when she was dealing with her husband's alcoholism. Since then I've ordered it for another friend who also found it comforting. Now years later I searched to find it for myself. No particular reason. It just always stuck in my mind because of its simplicity and quiet meaning. If you like inspirational books, this is a keeper and makes an excellent gift."
1,not what i expected,Didn't realize it was like a children's book. 5 x7 in size and just a bunch of short pro's.
4,Excellent book for mastering your Palm,"I own a PalmPilot, and this book is great for mastering every part of your Palm. Although many people don't like the Graffiti language, the chart in the front of the book with the Graffiti shortcuts has helped me with inserting text into my PalmPilot. Also, there are some useful applications that are on a CD that comes with the book that can help you with everyday stuff, like travel information, keeping track of your investments and some games. One minor detail is that most of the information is for the newer Palm III series of PalmPilots, so my old PalmPilot can not do all of the features mentioned in the book. If you have a newer Palm, it's a great book. All in all, this Idiot's Guide is much better than any Palm manual I know of, and it will definetly help you get started with your new Palm, whether you're an idiot or not."
1,Thou shall never utter the word PalmPilot. O.K.?,"It's been called the Palm offically for years. Thanx to the shinny suited Board of Directors. I know 'cause I used to own stock in PalmPilot - and I was informed in glossy, slippery paper and clever muli-colored graphics that I shall here forth refer to the gadget/company as Palm. Sorry I forget the silly sensible reasons given. Something to do with the tides on Pluto or Neptune I think.So all together now. ""PALM, PALM, PALM, PALM, PALM........Are the cows home yet? "" Arn"
3,"Good Concept, But Boring","My children are 4 and 5 and they were utterly bored by this book. I like the concept and the repetition is good, but it's just not that well written. My sons listened to it once and never again, even when I tried to pull it out a few more times."
3,good,you should read this book before any others and before you check out the world wide web for information on astral projection. it's that good
1,Leaving The Body by D. Scott Rogo,Not Recommended!!!!!Example: No solid - systematic methods - just a bunch of stories - and very hard to do exerices that don't work. Rogo should try to hold is breath on a count of 100 like he suggests in the book.
3,OK book for learning about OBEs.,"If you never had an OBE (out of Body experience) before, this book will give you some good information but lacks content. Many ways of doing OBEs are covered, but the coverage seems a little simplistic. I consider this book an average to slightly above average book on OBEs. This being said, I do not consider this book a bad one. It is worthwhile reading if you accompany it by other material."
2,this is the most boring book I've ever seen before,"the author of this book spend pages and pages about experiences of people who has positive obe,but give very few exercises,the point that made mad with this book is that you read and read only testimony and nothing else,is good to read about people who has been succesfull,but is not fair that the entire book is dedicated to thisvery mediocre book! I dont reccommend it"
5,Most Excellent Book!!!!,"I purchased this book and was EXTREMELY happy I did. What a great read!!! There are only four chapters, and they are very well organized. Each reads like warm butter. I am going to pick this book back up after I make my way through a few others purchased and re-read. It's that good! The chapter on what's great about the Catholic Church and the last one on the Saints is just wonderful!Of note, I am going through RCIA with the Catholic Church, and boy, what a great resource of information. Even for cradle Catholics, this book is a must have. Highly recommended for anyone."
2,Proceed with Caution,Rohr is a polarizing figure and his ideas can lead the unwary away from the true teachings of the church. Check out Sharon Lee Giganti and the New Age Deception for more info or contact her personally.
5,"High-energy girl group, both 60s and 80s retro","You're going to hear about these girls very, very soon. They've exploded on the British pop scene and their universal appeal will catapult them over to the States any day now. The Pipettes are an unabashed sugary-sweet 60s-style girl group with group harmonizing, hand claps, and even over-the-top Phil Specter-ish arrangements. They are redonkulously catchy. But even if you don't like The Angels or The Shirelles, the Pipettes also have high-energy tunes that will bring to mind The Go-Gos and Toni Basil (in particular, ""We Are The Pipettes"" and their most memorable track ""Your Kisses Are Wasted On Me"")."
2,Not all I expected,"I typically like the light-hearted advice books (especially ""The Sweet Potato Queens' Book of Love"" and ""The Go-Girl Guide: Surviving your 20s with Savvy, Soul, and Style""), but this one didn't compare. I expected great (or at least witty) advice about the working world and found small chapters without great advice. I agree with another reviewer that a lot of it is just common sense advice and it became boring a lot of the time. I would recommend other advice books instead."
2,Light on Substance & Style,"The book was a bit of a disappointment and didn't live up to its lofty title. The advice was, well...dull. Trust me, the girl trying to live up to this book will be far from hip!"
3,Disappointed,"I found that this book was not what I had hoped it would be. The chapters are all very short, so it never goes much in depth on anything. A lot of the advice was really kind of obvious common sense. It can be a useful light overview of work-related topics, but don't expect anything really detailed."
1,waste of money,"Speech Recognition: Theory and C++ ImplementationThis book is empty and trivial, and there is no companion CD_ROM as mention inside the book, the C++ code in the internet is poorly documented and not working,finaly don't puchase this book."
1,No redeeming features,"This is the story of a politician, soon to be president, who cannot control himself when facing a woman. The film falls short in every category."
3,Wireless and Convenient,"Got the Wideye after learning our cheaper wireless controllers didn't support a headset (except at the base - boy, did I feel dumb). The Wideye hooked up pretty easily, though the instructions seemed a little convoluted. Got it to ""see"" the base after a 5 second lapse, then it worked perfectly. Buttons are skewed slightly and tiny so it'll take me some time to get used to the layout during HALO 2 (I do love to B someone in the face). Headset works fine and people seems to hear me okay. A few random disconnects and some ""pop"" noises in the earpiece. Satisfies my need to chat though."
2,Dissapointed,"Not good. Disk one, Stone the Crows Live @ Montreaux is basically rubbish. Disk 2, Maggie Bell Live @ The Rainbow, London, is OK but if you want these tracks they're 100x better performed on Maggie's Suicide Sal CD."
4,Broil King Double Buffet Server Performs Well,"The Broil King Double Buffet Server did all that was expected. It kept a paella and meatballs hot all during a five hour party. The only slight dissapointment was the quality of the stainless steel inserts. They were not as heavy duty as I thought they would be. They did clean up well, but scratched a little from the serving spoons. In general I was very happy with the product and look forward to using it again."
3,Ehhhh.....,"The first few tunes sound like backing tracks before the ""vocals"" were recorded. It gets better after that...but doesn't live up to the hype. The track ""Dog Days"" is very good though, but one track does not an album make.Still enjoyable........but....."
5,Great doll for little boys,"We bought this doll for our 23 month old son who loves to care for baby dolls. The doll is a nice size, especially for sleeping in the crib, and it's lightweight and easy to tote around. We also purchased the stroller at the same time and he enjoys pushing the baby around the house and on walks. We haven't had the doll that long, so I'm not sure how durable it is yet. Although it is made of sturdy, soft plastic and the fabric and velcro on the sleeper are of good quality. So far these Graco toys have been a great find."
1,"Out of date, lacks MANY common species","This book is almost 20 years old and it shows. It lacks many common species, and what information it does have is very very high level. I would recommend that the reader find ANOTHER book. I wish I had spent my money elsewhere."
4,Encyclopedia of Marine Invertebrates,"This is a wonderful and informative book that you will want to have in your collection if you are thinking about becoming a ""reefer"" or are already one. You will find the answers to the many questions you will have in this fantastic book."
4,Best Beauty Secret Ever,"Gave it 4 stars because it really doesn't work with all eyeshadows -- some are too soft and clump up on the brush, but when it works, it works very well. Goes on smoothly and stays on so much better than almost any liquid or pencil I've found yet, and it only takes a drop so a bottle lasts quite a long time."
5,Must Own Book For Any Piano Enthusiast,"Simply I would put, ""Must-own for all piano enthusiasts."" It's really interesting to read through this book although it looks like a dictionary, as it contains a lot of gossips that might be taken from his interview with many pianists. Sometimes he put too much importance on his own favorite pianists (i.e., Horowitz), but still fun to read. I hope this book continues to grow its contents as time passes, if possible for him."
5,An excellent reference for piano lovers,"This is a rich, passionately written, concise encyclopedia about great pianists and great piano composers. It includes brief but interesting biographical material, and astute critiques of the professional and creative apects of the artists lives. David Dubal absolutely loves music and has a profound, sensitive and clear understanding of it. The CD of classic recordings that is included in the back of this book is a fabulous compliment to a most useful guide and reference for all those who enjoy piano music."
2,A Great Disappointment,"This is a big book, ambitious in intent, but the task was not carried out with sufficient thoroughness. Indeed, the author is quite amateurish in the manner in which he dismisses a number of very distinguished pianists in a few unenlightening lines and devotes several pages to others. Less than half the book is given over to pianists anyway: the larger second part lists the major compositions of composers for the piano followed by a list of the author's recommended versions. I didn't find this very enlightening or helpful.Finally, Dubal should have spared us his portaits of a number of pianists: they really are hideous and amateurish in the extreme."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in the color since it is not a true green, but more on the greyish side. The fabric is easy to snag. I did find that it requires no ironing and is attractive."
5,Excellent,"The tabla player on this album is amazing. He outshines the rubabist, who is also awesome. This album is very Indian in sound. The rags and ghani? (little new to the Afghan music) chosen are of a more minor/dissonant nature than the Afghan music I've heard on popular Afghan websites. The instrument itself is related to sarod, but much more percussive due to frets. The tabla player steals the show though. His use of bhari/khali technique is flawless and easily readable. Clear use of the bayan (bass) drum, not just a blur of bols. But then he hits off these rolls and uses varying stresses and mixes with syncopation. Amazing. As good as Ali Ackbar Khan and his tablaist. An excellent buy!"
1,disappointment,"What was useful wasn't new. And what little was new, wasn't useful. The majority of the book (80%), was devoted to subjects that were covered better in other real estate books. There was very little useful information on locating and buying real estate out of Probate.Don't waste your money."
1,Not a Good Book,"The book is titled ""Creating Wealth Through Probate"". I'm not a highly experienced investor, but I'm certainly not a newbie. I've read 3 real estate investing books in the last month or two and this is the worst of them. In fact, I'm actually not sure if I should try to sell it on Amazon because I don't want someone else to waste their money.If the book is about probate, talk about probate. ""Tales of Probate"" and Appendices are great, but they have little value in actually achieving wealth through probate. The author does talk about probate, but he also goes into real estate investing in general. This was a mistake. There are many, many books that discuss this topic. All of the books that I've read on real estate investing are better in content and go into further detail. No need to beat a dead horse."
2,A GOOD PRIMMER BUT NEEDS MORE,THIS BOOK MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO GET YOU TO PURCHASE THE WRITERS HOW TO PRODUCT. IT WAS INTERESTING BUT ONLY HALF OF IT WAS SUBJECT MATTER AND THE REST WAS A GLOSSERY OF THINGS THAT I DDNT KNOW WHAT IT WAS FOR.
1,"Nice anecdotes about the success of others, but where is the meat?","Thank goodness I did not purchase this book! The library saves me again. A worthless read that did nothing to educate me in investing in probate real estate. The author focuses on anecdotal stories, mostly of success with making money off personal property--not real estate."
1,Not worth it.,"This book does not give solid practical advice. If you're a new investor who has never bought a house before, perhaps this would work for you. But if you've bought and fixed up a property it isn't for you. You'd be better served going to the probate court in your area and asking questions. It included lots of general anecdotes, but it makes one wonder why he wrote it if he weren't truly going to share how to do it. The actual probate advice in this book could be condensed to a 10-page pamphlet."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I too had high expectations of this book. What a let down. I read alot of real estate books and this is the first time I felt cheated by the author. I thought this was a step by step book on how to purchase probate properties but I was dead wrong. Save your money, we all can't be wrong about this book..."
1,Don't spend your money on this one!,Rarely do I write book reviews but this one was so bad that I feel obligated to let people know about it. The bottom line is that this book lacks the detail needed to really teach a person about the probate system and how to use it to successfully invest in real estate.
1,Garbage,This thing is a piece of trash at best. I just got 4 of them at my office and installing them has been a nightmare. Good luck if you ever want to scan anything. Not to mention I did some checking in the HP support forums and the problems are the same across the board and HP doesn't seem the least bit interested in fixing any of them. Too busy counting their money i guess. I'd like to punch the person from our company who bought these things.
4,HP Color LaserJet 2840 All-In One Printer/Copier/Scanner/Fax,The Automatic Document Feeder did not work on the machine when I got it. I called HP Technical Support. They sent me a new ADF to install. New one didn't work. A Technician came to fix the problem which was in the circuit board. Everyone I talked to at HP were very nice and service was fast. Everything is working fine now.
2,I gave it to a local charity,I gave it to a local charity and I kind of feel bad about that.... terrible printer...This machine will only make a copy of the Fax to your computer if it is hooked up to your computer via USB. AND IT WILL NOT PRINT FAX AND MAKE A FAX COPY TO YOUR COMPUTER at the same time. You can only have one OR the other; Copy or Print. It is too stupid to do both at once. Shame on HP.I bought this machine as a Fax replacement for a 1999 hp inkjet that could print and save a copy... at the same time. grrrrrrrrrrrr
1,very very delay. till now i didn't get the item,I was a regular costumer but this time delivery is very very delay. till now i didn't get the printer.
5,HP 2840 - Great value.,"We bought this equipment for our City Hall offices with high expectations. We have not been let down! Packing and shipping were important items, as we live in rural Alaska. Everything arrived in perfect condition. Functionality exceeds our expectations in all areas."
2,"Slow, Clunky Software and No Scan to Email","I've owned HP printers for 15 years and this will probably be the last HP printer that I buy. The printer is slow, in fact it's slower than my old HP 5M. I only seem to get about 3 PPM on some jobs I frequently send to it (printing image based PDFs). Only in special cases will it approach the suggested speed of 20 ppm. Also, the software needed on the PC to configure and support the scan functionality is clunky and unreliable. Further, I bought it believing that it had scan to email functionality, as suggested by the literature. In fact it only has scan to PC which can imitate scan to email only with HP software plus an email client (e.g. Outlook) running on the PC. Fine if you want to dedicate a PC as a print server."
3,LASERJET ALL IN ONE,"This printer fail to live up the expectation of a HP printer. Within two months after I purchase it, it stop working. Right now it is with the service department and has being for about a month now. I am very disappointed. Eventhough HP printer are all i buy and I really saying that this fail me really bad.Janet2007 08 10"
2,Tech Support Nightmare,If you are looking for printer that is going to require a lot of maintaniance then buy this. So far I have owned this printer for 4 months and have spent approximately 20 hours on tech supporting this thing. When it works it is great but when it goes down be prepared.
1,Scanner not Compatible with Windows 7 64 bit - Do Not Buy,I called the HP support this morning and they say they will not upgrade the compatibility of the scanner with windows 7 - 64 Bit... it's absolutely worthless!
1,Worst HP product EVER,AVOID this device at all costs- it is a nightmare if you want to use it with Vista or on a network and the support is even worse. HP has trully failed its customers with this one
1,Waste of Money,"Used to think highly of HP as a company; this Laserjet has changed my previously high regard. Doesn't work on office network; had to pay extra money to IT to make the printer work on the network. Waste of money; machine constantly is ""initializing..."", interrupting available print time, which takes too long once it starts. Color cartridges are outrageously expensive. Wish I'd sent this thing back the first day. Will buy Brother next time.HP Color LaserJet 2840 All-in-One Printer/Copier/Scanner/Fax (Q3950A#ABA)"
1,HP lets the world down,"After getting what we thought was a good Christmas deal on this printer, we have been totally disappointed to discover that, contrary to stated compatibility on the box and other documentation, it is not compatible with Mac OS X Leopard. After a call to support we discover that they are still writing software for Leopard here at the end of January and it will not be available for the foreseeable future. It is hard to believe that a company as reputable as HP would do such a horrendous job with software and misrepresent their products' compatibility in all their documentation."
2,FALSE CLAIMS ON CARTRIDGE LIFE,"I have owned this printer for around 4 years and have found it to be the least desireable printer I have owned. I purchased it to eliminate the need for having a higher speed laser B/W and an inkjet for color prints. The printer is big and bulky, very heavy, and incredibly noisy - especially with its constant recalibrating. The cartridges claim to have 5,000 page life - I have never gotten more than 500 pages from the color cartridges - considering they cost in excess of $100 per cartridge, that makes your cost per page around $3 for a color print - absurd. The print quality is excellent but I have seldom found this to be a problem with any printer."
4,Liked the Printer,"I bought this printer in 2006. The noises are accurate, as this product does calibrate a lot. It also has issues with Windows 7, but I just downloaded the drivers and it seemed fine. Like others, I added memory and it printed fine. It printed in nice quality - and served me well. We upgraded and I donated this printer. Not the best HP ever put out, but not as bad as some have made it out to be. Bottom line - it works well if you keep up with the technology."
4,Built like a brick outhouse,"I've been flogging my 2840 since that model first came out, several years ago. It has required NO service, except for toner, for which it has a hearty appetite. (Word to the wise: Use only HP toner. If you don't you'll get bitten someday.)This printer/scanner takes forever to warm up, and goes through a noise self-config every half hour or so. It's noisy as the dickens when printing, and slow as molasses. But . . . print quality (at business level, not graphic designer level) is excellent. And as I described earlier, it is built to last."
1,Horrible Software,"This was my third HP all-in-one (Laserjet 3330 and Officejet 9110) and I had the same experience with the 2840 as I did with the 9110 - incredibly bad!On each of the second two, it took over four hours on the phone with HP Tech Support to get it installed. With this one at the end of the conversation the support guy found a tech note that paraphrased my second grade report card: `HP all-in-ones don't play well together'.The note was right on the money. My advice is that if this is the only HP all-in-one you will ever have installed it may be ok. If you have ever installed another one on the same system before, avoid the second one like the plague!In any case carefully consider the other reviews on this box.In my experience, going back 35 years, HP PC related software is consistently among the worst in the industry -- the software for this product is no exception."
2,Will not work with Win2000 Server,Printer works OK so far. It is slow and loud but output is excellent. Installation over network for WinXP and 2000 workstations is straightforward. But be aware that this printer will NOT work with Win2000 Server. The printer can not even be found over the network from Win2000 Server. This means I cannot use this printer with my server or any of the thin clients I have on my network. I would not have purchased the unit if I had known this.HP should have put this warning on its documentation and web site.
1,Look elsewhere,"I am forced to use this printer at the office and I can't stand it. It's loud, the color quality is poor, it is soooo slow and the build quality is poor. I'm not surprised that it breaks down all the time. I would recommend going to one of those office stores and running a test page on a few color laser printers before you go and buy this one. I tried all the color laser printers and picked a different brand for my home office, I found one that is cheaper, quieter much much faster and has incredible color quality and bought a separate scanner and it was still cheaper than the HP 2840. Whatever you do, don't let the name HP guide you in your buying decision!!!"
1,No scanning with windows 7,The scanner will not work with windows 7. HP says they will have new driver....and have been saying so for a year! Don't buy this printer!
1,2840 does not work well with Windows7 64 bit,"The hardware is solid and print quality very good. Installation is a nightmare and the software is terrible; common problems for HP devices. HP never released a driver for the scanner for Windows7 64 bit so I cannot scan long documents. HP suggests using Windows Fax and Scan, a terrible solution since the Windows scan program does not create pdf files and only scans one page at a time into separate files. The printer was sold as a business printer but once I started using Windows7 64 bit the printer doesn't work well and the scanner is essentially useless. This is my last HP device. HP tech support is also not helpful."
1,Worst All-In-One Ever!!!,"HP really dropped the ball on this one. I have to reinstall my driver every time I want to scan a document. I've been in contact with HP for almost two years about this problem, and they still can't offer a solution. At this point they simply tell me I'm out of warranty. After looking on the internet, it's pretty clear that this is a common problem if you use Windows Vista or Windows 7. I can understand that difficulties come up trying to create driver software that's compatible with someone else's operating system, but it appears they are choosing to ignore this problem and hope it passes with time. What's happened is that I no longer trust HP. I'm looking for a trustworthy machine if anyone knows a good manufacturer."
1,Horrible support,Don't even think about buying this one. HP provides no support for this printer with Vista or Windows 7. That means all of the functions are essentially useless -- save for printing simple pages. Complex pages won't print with the generic software. No scanner support. HP Director not available.Hard to imagine that HP thinks this will help their reputation.
1,An bloated dud,"If an auto manufacturer built a car that would stop the moment it reached its 25,000 mile checkup threshold, it would be front page news. But that is what the HP 2840 does when it is low on toner, it just stops. I would prefer it let me know, but finish the job with less quality color. It causes undo stress when trying to meet a deadline.Furthmore, this machine requires you to toggle its USB port on or off depending on whether you want to print or scan. A time-consuming menance.Finally, I had many issues with printing large files when the machine would just stop printing in the middle of a 2nd or 3rd copy of a report. It would not provide me an error message, or ability to restart.So this big piece of junk is off to the recycler along with the four toner cartridges I never used."
1,Terrible,"The scan function is a train wreck. Get used to troubleshooting daily, with your network administator and with HP technical support. Even the support staff at HP will concede that the 2840 is garbage. You can't really ""fix"" the problems--you can just patch them for a few scans and then a new batch of difficulties will crop up. ""I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that."""
2,"Printer OK, Scanner is very network un-friendly","If all you want is a printer, this unit is OK, but don't buy an HP2840 if you expect network friendly scanning functionality. The scan function is heavily dependent on software running on a PC. After owning this unit for a while, I finally gave it away and bought a Lexmark X422, which is an example of true network scanning (can scan *directly* to email and FTP (unlike the HP) and has java based scan-to-browser that doesn't require any installed software). Unfortunately the Lexmark is not color, but at least it's an example of how it can be done. Moral: know what you want and what to look for when it comes to scanning in a network multiuser environment."
2,Network + Vista + HP 2840 = Not so all in one,I purchased this printer whiling running Windows XP and was very happy with its network functionality. Everything worked well and integrated with the OS. Upgraded many of my PC to vista and it all went away. Took months for HP to geta driver to get the printer portion of the machine to work over the network. 6 months later and still can't fax or scan over the network. Thankfully I have one XP system that is fully functional.So in short. Nice printer but if you are buying this printer to utilize the network capabilities and are running Vista or planning on running vista. Take a pass
1,Worst software installation in the world,What are they thinking? A 1 hour long install process and full of garbage install programs. And on Windows XP they should be using the default drivers and scanner on Windows. Not recommended for normal use unless you have plenty of time to burn.
1,NO VISTA DRIVERS?,"I've had this printer for 1 yr. HP has been promising Vista drivers each month and at the end of Aug 07- still no drivers. Without the HP Director software and drivers, I cannot SCAN or FAX with this printer. The Colors are terrible using the single Vista PCL driver that HP has provided (via a download). When I print B&W- it uses the color toner cartridges and not the large Black cart it should be using making the printouts very expensive. Don't buy this printer if you plan to use Vista."
4,A Nice All-in-One,"I was really worried when I saw the bad reviews here before I made the purchase. However, after I purchased and installed one myself, it was not bad at all. I agree that the installation process take a long hour to complete, but I don't find it that difficult or complicated. It will not take you a lot of time to connect every pieces. Most of the setup time will be spent on installing the software. I believe as long as you follow the installation instruction without skipping any step, there should be no problem.The printing quality is excellent, and the software is easy to use. The only one shortfall this printer has is the scanning quality. Color is a bit distored and clarity can be improved. However, if you are looking for a printer with all the basic functions, this is the one for you."
2,Think before you buy,"I bought this machine last year, it will hang very frequently, I leave it on all the time; but when I am ready to scan or copy, the machine will just hang, I had to turn it off and on for it to work. The machine likes to calibate itself every 6 hours, and waste ink. Also, a lot of people c/o of it dies after short time. So think twice before buy this machine."
2,Not so good on an Apple,"I thought the software was crappy because this was being used on an Apple. However, after reading the other reviews, maybe its just plain lousy. The setup looks cracker jack (which is surprising for such an expensive printer). Documents get stuck in the print queue and refuse to print and I can't delete them. Then one day, they just disappear on their own. Adobe PDFs in color won't print properly. HP's response? Talk to Adobe.I've owned 3 HPs in the past - a laser and 2 inkjets. Never before have a I ever had such a problem with an HP printer. The print quality is good when you can get the thing to work. Also, cleaning, is a real hassle.Overall, I wish I had waited and bought another printer."
3,No Scanner for Win 7_64 bit,"I have a LaserJet 2840, with Windows 7_64 bit. I installed the print driver for Window 7 64 bit. The software does NOT recognize the scanner. The HP website says the scanner is not functional with Windows 7_64 bit. Funny thing is, my LaserJet 3330 (2003 vintage) works just fine and is fully functional (including the scanner) with Windows 7_64 bit. What is going on with HP?"
2,Black on Both Sides overshadows it,It's not as good as his other albums. He tries too hard and he praises himself way too much. Poor guy; no wonder it had a fake case.
2,Focus Group,"Look, I loved Mos Def as much as the next guy but if these are the types of efforts he's going to ""grace"" us with, then he just needs to quit and stick to movies. It's clear he doesn't have the time to bother with a clear direction for his music, and True Magic is no different. The cheapness of it's product design tells you that right off the bat, the lack of focus on the tracks themselves only solidifies the point."
4,Great Name,"I always think that my favorite rappers are going to amaze everytime I buy their latest cd. Although I did like True Magic. I didn't think it was anything special. It seemed homemade. The beats were average loopdy Loops. One thing I will say is that Mos Def came correct with the lyrics, as usual. So, buy it for Mos but don't expect any ground breaking material."
3,Mos Def,A few great songs but not enough to give it any higher than 3 stars. Wish that he would make his music a priory and put together a solid record with more than two or three keepers.
4,Decent MOS cd,"A good Mos Def cd, nothing like his classic black on both sides. It has a rough feel but is a good purchase."
4,This is just heat,"F*** a review, just cop it. Possibly 4 1/2 stars even, best album since BOBS. Way better than New Danger"
4,Gi dis man a break people!!!!!,"This album suprised me because i didn't think it was going to be that good but I was impressed. No it's not like his first classic and it's better than his last ""experiment"" yes I call that album that cuz that's what it was! Great effort by Mos going back to the basics. Mos need 9th Wonder, Hi Tek, Khrysis, and Nicolay in his life! These are the producers that I think can resurrect his creativity he came into the game with. Very good album, don't trip on the CD case, you ain't listening to that anyway so people get over it. Do you Mos!!"
3,a little disappointed,"The vocals and lyrical content of True Magic are good (after all it is Mos Def) but the production is lacking. It sounds like the music was made mostly with corny keyboard sounds and some of it sounds like the Kanye West style, which, frankly, I'm sick of. Everything sounds too clean and nice. Mos's vocals and message are better suited for either a more gritty underground production style or the jazz/blues sounds on The New Danger."
3,Disappointing,"Black on Both Sides was an absolute rap classic. The New Danger was somewhat disappointing, but listenable. This album...just not that great. Get back with Kweli, Mos."
4,"classic mos def sound, with modern feel","i stumbled across this accidentally, but it's a solid offering. his obligatory reference to new orleans is actually a pretty good song. overall it's classic mos def while still feeling fresh in 2007."
4,"No matter what they say,,,,","Whether this is contractual filler or legitimate content, this album is still miles beyond 95% of ""hip hop"" stocking your local record store shelves and flying out of amazon's warehouses. If you like Mos and hip hop music, this is for you, regardless of what might come out later. And his lyrical abilities, though criticized, are more pure and raw to follow the music, which is pure and raw. And who needs cover art? It's music, not foreplay."
3,"""a big f.u to geffen""","alright im sure you've all heard the rumors that this is not an official album, but that true magic will be ""offically"" released soon. im gonna go off this premise & im just gonna offer a little commentary on this cd, rather than an ""official"" review. now, from what i understand, mos has expressed some disappointment w/ geffen records, and this album is his last contractual obligation to the label, so if you really think about it, it makes perfect sense, what he's doing. he purposely had no cover art, re used beats, and it seems as if the album was not mastered properly. with poor sound quality, alot of filler & no promotion, he basically wanted this album to flop. this would be a big f. u. to geffen. now i have no facts to base this on, but it makes perfect sense, and i truly hope im right. so i wouldnt write black dante off just yet, i have a strong feeling that the mighty mos will be hitting us with some real ""true magic"", on the independant tip really soon."
3,Mos.. you can do way better!,"Let me preface this by saying I'm a huge Mos Def fan... Brought all his other albums, seen him in concert; in my opinion he's one of the best MC's out there today. Black on both Sides is legendary material. That's why I'm so disappointed in this album. I agree with one of the other reviewers, this sounds like filler material. It might be better than a lot of the crap on the radio nowadays, but it isn't up to par when compared to his previous work. Even the production sounds a little off. I don't know if he's getting 5 stars from some people based on reputation, but I've listened to his album over and over and still can't get into it. It's so frustrating cause Mos is so talented; what happened to the Mos that could break off a rhyme so drop and precise that it's mind blowing. He isn't on here. Please Mos give me something I can feel! Giving him 3 stars cause I have too much respect for him to give him anything lower... even though in this case it might deserving ."
5,BOB DEAN'S COSMIC TOP SECRET,I originally rented this set of DVD's from Netflix. I was so impressed I just had to own them. Whether you are thoroughly versed on Ufo / ET facts or just beginning to study the phenomena you will be blown away by the interviews and the information they reveal.
4,Definitive,"This little gem will satisfy. Barnard Herrmann himself conducts the National Philharmonic in doing the ""modern chamber music"" that made Psycho so distinctive.Ruthlessly original use of a very old form...The rest is good, too, although not as strong as the first two segments. This CD is a great value."
4,Easy to use,This wax is fantastic compared to regular waxes like the ones Gigi makes. It's not as painful or messy as those other waxes; Heats up really quickly. This product looses one star on it's cost...32.99 for 800g pack + 10 for shipping comes out quiet costly.
1,This video is an ad for Clark,"Thi video is not an instructunal aid but an advertisement for Clark's customizing shop. Do not buy this item to learn any gunsmithing, buy it if you want to know what services are available from Clark. I was very disappointed to have paid so much to purchase an ad video."
5,Story of the heart,"I'm a school librarian and read Crossing Jordon to preview it for a middle school media center. I read award winning young adult novels constantly, so it is a rare story that makes me cry. This is the first YA novel that has made me cry since A Day No Pigs Would Die. Although the two main characters are girls, middle school boys constantly ask for this novel to read. The characters are well developed and the plot moves at a steady pace--neither too fast or too slow. Although the characters and setting accurately depict the west side of Tallahassee--this story is so much more than a regional novel. It is a story of friendship and neighbors and how hearts are stronger than bigotry. Fogelin knows how to build a story that is timeless in scope, but particular enough to feel the hope and forgiveness of the human heart."
4,Tearing down the fence,"This was a read-aloud book for my sixth grade class. Most books we read I can't get into, but this one was just enough action to keep me guessing. I live in near Chicago so I really don't have to deal with much bigotry, but theres always some wherever you go. This book has a lot to do with things I'm interested. So it is very interesting for me. A girl's father needs to accept that some people just like to help others, and not try to prove they are better. He shouldn't punish his daughter for the way he was raised. I would definately recommend this book. It really shows that children can deal with large problems, just as well as adults."
3,"For the most part, pretty good","This novel had a good focus but far too many things seemed a little far-fetched to me. The things that went on almost seemed impossible. Other times, however, things seemed understated. It is however a good balance of humor and the hard facts of life, with well-developed characters (slightly stereotypic unfortunately), and a good overall voice and tone. Unfortunately, at the same time as the author told her own story, she also gave away the entire plot of Jane Eyre. That disappointed me slightly."
3,Color not true to photo,"I bought this as a gift expecting a medium to deep purple amethyst and light green peridot. The main stone was more of a tan or pale pale lavendar. Because the shape was so pretty, I kept it, but the amethyst was a disappointing color."
4,THE SOUND OF FRIENDSHIP,"Dr. Alexander G. Bell, noted for his work with deaf persons (Dr. Bell's mother and wife were both deaf) served as a mentor for young Helen Keller. Both deaf and blind, she stirred an interest in Dr. Bell to further his work with the deaf. Charmed by the bright, vivacious child, Dr. Bell began corresponding with her regularly when she was still a child at the Perkins Institute for the Blind. A long term friendship developed and it was a real heartwarming treat to see how friendship rang out across their different generations."
1,Retarded,"I had to read this book for school, and it was retarded. I do not know why anybody would write this book or why anybody has even bought this book. Do not ever ever ever ever read this book. I would rather watch Barney or Telatubies than read this book and I am 11 years old, yes it really is that bad. There is no point to this book. Do not waste your money on tis retarded book"
2,So so,"Purchased this when I was having a hard time locating the product I normally use, Lab Series Electric Shave Solution. Had high hopes but found that it does very little in the way of setting up my beard for a good electric shave. In fact, to some extent, it seems to be a step backward, creating more friction. Have returned to my Lab Series roots!"
4,bobc,"I've used Anthony Electric Pre-Shave for over 6 years with great shaving results on sensitive skin. Product is pricey, but very effective as a little goes a long way with no lingering fragrance. Also, the few competitor products that are available are much less expensive and nowhere near as effective."
4,Works for me,"I've been using this for a while. It seems to work well. Don't put a tiny bit on and expect things to be a ton different than shaving without--you have to apply a good amount. And it does get expensive. But if you put enough on, I find that it helps reduce snags to a degree.The only thing is the smell. It's extremely strong and smells similar to some sort of alcohol (think, nail polish remover). Don't put any around your upper-lip--it'll be hard to breathe through your nose until it soaks in."
2,Pointless?,"The good: This product smells nice. That is it.The bad: After applying this to my face (have tried a lot, have tried a little) my electric razor sticks to my skin and drags my flesh along with it. There is no smooth glide. I get a smoother glide and closer shave using nothing.Lectric Shave works better than this stuff does. Guess I will try out the Lab Series products."
4,Very nice,I like Anthony Logistics electric pre-shave. There is no alcohol in it. It smells very nice and really seems to work. I get a better shave as a result of using it. My only reservation is that the razor doesn't slide as well as with oily pre-shaves.
4,sweeping saga,"This is a sophisticated, intellectual, historical and highly emotional love story. Bernieres has demonstrated an astounding vocabulary along with a complex, sophisticated and intellectually astute style. The novel takes a little while to get off the ground but don't let this disappoint you! Corelli's Mandolin provides a wonderful history lesson re: WW2 and the relationship that existed between Italy and Greece. This is not a ""light"" read but it is certainly very rewarding."
4,"Good book, bad ending","This was the first recommendation from my sister-in-law and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Would have been 5 stars but the end is pretty unimaginative and tired (ghost writer /publisher re-write?) However, that won't stop me from reading another book by de Bernieres."
3,"3/4 wonderful, 1/4 dismal","I just finished reading this book and started it with a great deal of anticipation and wonderment. The characters were so well drawn, the weaving of historical fact and fiction expertly done, the language so precise and beautiful, with a compelling story that had me turning pages as quickly as I could, and constantly thinking and dreaming about this beautiful island in a turquoise sea and the people who lived there.I was fully prepared for Corelli to die. Far preferable for the the author to give him an honorable death than to resort to such a cliched, unlikely, completely unbelievable and out-of-character ending! I was heartsick, and for reasons I surely wasn't expecting from the first part of the novel. Disappointing in the extreme!I can't imagine what the author was thinking. Perhaps it was his editors? Perhaps it was part of the movie deal? I'll never know, but I do wish that I had stopped reading before this wonderful novel became mired in so much implausible muck."
2,A Book Club Opinion,"Our book club chose Corelli's Mandolin because of the many good reviews we saw. We didn't feel the book lived up to the good reviews. Our conclusion tonight was that the book must have been written by two different authors. The first part of the book was lyric, beautifully crafted, emotionally involving, and a joy to read. The second part seemed as if it was written by someone who didn't care whether the characters seemed plausible, and had little interest in pace or character development. It was flat, unconvincing, and amazingly, irritatingly leaden. I told our group that de Bernieres needed an editor, and that I would step in to fill this role for him. I told the group how the book should have ended, which was roughly 100 pages sooner, and with the two main characters acting in character. This would have avoided the nutburger kind of unsatisfying conclusion that you can read in the book as written, before I stepped in to fix things! (g)"
1,Awful,"I'll never trust a bookcover blurb again. The characterization and plot of this book, not to mention the dialogue, suggest the musings of a ten-year old. This book totally disappointed me. And even if you like the first 400 pages, skip the last hundred, because they're worse."
4,Live the Book,"Once in a while a gem of a book comes along that redeems all the trash that's published along with it. This is that book. Now that I found it, I want to share the treasure with you. This book describes the occupation of the peaceful Greek island of Cephallonia during WW2 by peaceful Italians soldiers, including a captain whose obsession is with playing the mandolin. The use of images is breathtaking, especially those about the travails the soldiers went through on both sides and a haunting description of a firing squad. Also laudable are the uses of subtle allusions to Greek myths, as well as the virtuosic switching of narrators that made the story more lively. I give it four stars because the end dragged and the authors portrayed the Italian soldiers as saints, while the Germans were murderous, the Greeks insincere, and the British insouciant. But altogetherm this is a great book. Why do you need a movie when you can live the book?"
2,Shallow treatment of a complex time,"The lack of dimension of the characters and predictability of plot elements makes this book one of the least worthwhile examinations of people during wartime (WWII) that can be found anywhere.The sense that this book was written in hopes that it would be made into a major motion picture in inescapable. From the charming, good-hearted greek villagers to the evil nazis, there isn't a surprise in the book."
3,I wasn't prepared for so much bloodshed,"Having read ""Birds Without Wings"" I should have been prepared for massacres. But I wasn't. It's certainly an interesting and believable look at the invasion of Greece. But SO awful. And I really can't bear books based on a misunderstanding that could be cleared up in 5 minutes. But instead leads to,years of suffering for all parties."
4,Correlli's Mandolin,"An enjoyable tale about the poor state of the Italian army in WW2 and the poor Greeks who had to in some cases look after them in their, the Greeks homes."
2,Poor characterisation and thin main plot.,"An over long book with much unnecessary and irrelevant detail. The characterisation is poor - we learn little of the people's past lives or of their opinions and the character of Corelli is one-dimensional at best. While intelligently written, the main plot is thin and has to be padded out to the point of absurdity. Maybe I am missing the point here with all the rave reviews, but I found this book to be boring and tedious."
5,Louis De Bernieres is brilliant,This may be the best book I've ever read. I laughed out loud and cried. So clever and well written. This book has made me want to read again.
3,Interesting and infuriating...,"Beautifully written in places, but flawed. Am I the only person to find the explanation for Corelli's 40 year disappearing act ludicrous? Apart from that there are some eloquent passages on love, death and war."
4,"Incredible story, but disappointing ending","I very much loved this book. It surprised me to no end, until I came to the end. I would have to agree with two other reviewers that the ending was very disappointing. It was rather formulaic and smacked of a hastily rewritten ending. I agreed with Pelagia's initial sentiments at the end of the book (which I can't reveal), but anyone who has and will read the book will understand. But the ride to the end of the book was thrilling and being one who knows little about WWII in the mediterranean, it was very refreshing (although I have read other reviewer's who take de Bernieres to task for historical inaccuracies). In any event the lost star was for the ending, but the other four stars are for the excellent story - I definitely recommend this book."
3,What an inadequate ending to an otherwise great book,"It is a surprise that on an island where there are no secrets, somebody's marital status would be a secret. Bernieres spins a good story, but he shows anxiety and rushes to end the book. It seems the story telling is so wild and enjoyable, all of a sudden it is time to end it and a few hasty, hurried chapters and a most improbable ending is all the author can do. It is abrupt and most disappointing. I strongly recommend The War of Don Emmanuels Nether Parts - a riot of a book but with an equally unsatisfying and inexplicable ending."
3,With so much happening....,"It took me three years to get past the first 70 or so pages of this book. With so much happening, I found myself waiting for something to happen. Once the real action started- about half way through- I was forced to read the rest to see if the ending would be a predictable hollywood type or if it would leave me with the emotional emptiness of the rest. What I found was a sad combination of the two. That being said, there is no way they will be able to capture the vastness of this novel, the highly historic characters, or the sense of interplay of global politics...too bad."
4,Great book but where is the ending?,I just loved this book and really got involved with its characters and story line. Where can I get myself a Corelli?!! This book is well worth the read but be forwarned that the author seems to run out of story at the end and just leaves you hanging with out resolving the major plot.
4,Will make you cry (but with a smile on your face).,"A first warning: This is not an easy read. The book's organization makes the beginning choppy, and somewhat hard to stay focused (or interested). However, persevere and you'll find yourself submerged in a charming (but simple) plot, and a language rich in original and delicate images. The story itself may make you not read it too fast... This is a beautifully told story. And it's beautiful in that special WWII way abot love, friendships, integrity and betrayal, survival and growth in the context of war. When the best of Man meets the worse of Man. The kind of story that makes you cry while smiling; if you liked Cinema Paradiso, not miss this one."
2,Overrated,"A big disappointment. Starts out well, but the author deevolves into history lectures and finally into an irrelevant 100-page ending. I am as susceptible to blurbs on the cover as any one else, but I advise the reader to resist the ones here."
2,I was disappointed!,"A friend recommended this book describing it as ""a great romance."" I was disappointed. Talk about a long and drawn-out beginning! I certainly was not convinced of Pelagia's love for Mandras...thought it to be more of a crush. I loved the imagery of the small Greek town, but was exasperated by the author's detailed descriptions of initial characters who later become irrelevant. I also felt that the author just skimmed past the latter half of the main characters' lives, and jumped to the ending...which I found incredulous. This book should be retitled ""Pelagia's Wasted Youth."" The only character who really touched me was Carlo Guercio, and the two stars are for him."
3,Mixed Feelings,"This book can be very entertaining if you are interested in the love-story. The descriptions are good and you can relate to most of the characters. The way the other ended the plot was a let down. (I won't give away the plot but suffice it to say, it should have been done slower and more realistically.)The historical details. Too many details condensed. EG: 100 years of history in three pages. It was like reading a laundry list. I understand from other readers that there are a lot of inaccuracies as well. Too bad.I found the beginning very slow. There were a few chapters from particular character's point of view that were completely irrelevant to the story. I particularly hated one that was a ""stream-of-consciousness"" chapter. Really irritating.ALL in all. It's an OK book but I wouldn't highly recommend it."
1,Tedious,"I had high expectations, but 200 pages into the book I was still wondering when it was going to start. Rambling, devoid of a coherent story line, cardboard characters, unbelievable ending...by the time I finished I was angry for sticking with it until the bitter end."
4,the quickest of thoughts,"once i adjusted to the onstensibly grandiose vocabulary, this was a fun, touching, and (perhaps) epic tale of love, war, and GREECE."
4,Wonderful book...definitly a keeper but the movie is er..,"The book is beautifully written you would want to travel to that Greek island...the characters are plausible the story itself is just amazing...what can i say i thoroughly enjoyed the book :)for those who hasn't read it forget about the hype and just enjoy it for what it is a really good read,i laughed and cried in so many areas.the movie on the other hand is a bit of a dissapointment for me i don't know if nicholas cage actually did justice to corellis character, cruz' portrayal of pelagia on the other hand was just so and so. I love the ending of the book and yet it was somehow changed in the movie...read the book and skip the movie..."
5,Stellar achievement by a new author!,"In Corelli's Mandolin, Louis De Bernieres has created characters so vital and compelling, that his book becomes a journey through the gamut of human experience and emotion, rather than mere words on paper. De Bernieres's first novel transports us through time to a wacky village on a Greek Island during war time, and through war ravaged Europe. We feel our feet grow cold and rotten in the trenches, we feel giddy with joy and longing during spring festivals, and we grieve over our lost love as we grow old with resignation. A young and brilliant master, Louis De Bernieres's vivid imagery should be watched with heart-pounding anticipation and a twinkle in the eyes"
2,Disappointing and Implausible Ending,"I had not heard of this book but became wrapped up in the beautifully written humor and tragedy of the love and war stories. However, I found the ending to be needlessly and pointlessly frustrating and tragic. Corelli did not act according to character in failing to rejoin Pelagia. This inconceivable ending basically ruined and brought into doubt the rest of the book and made me angry. What was the purpose of the author's manipulation of the plot in this way? I think it was irresponsible. I don't understand the overriding number of ""rave"" reviews."
5,Many copies being ordered for Christmas,"Only the second book in my life that made me cry. It was a gift from a friend, I would never have bought it on my own but I absolutely adored it."
4,"A powerful, captivating novel about the passions of life.","This novel dazzled me with its descriptive prose, its historical scope, and its emotional energy. The characters are beautifully developed within a story that draws at the human pathos. All that is at the heart of humanity is found in this novel--love, war, death, politics, family. The chapter about the firing squad is one of the most powerufl I have ever read, it left me shaken with feeling. Truly an accomplishment, I recomend it to everyone I know. I wish the ending were not so drawn out, just a minor complaint in an otherwise wondeful book."
5,touching and beautiful,"I read this in the British edition entitled 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' and found it so magical, it toppled my all-time favourite book of Anna Karenina. If you haven't read this yet, hurry up and do so!! It is so moving, witty, tragic and well-written."
5,"Rare and wonderful - just saw a cameo in ""Notting Hill"", too","What a story. Get through the first 50 pages and then you never want it to end. I was stunned to see a cameo of the British edition of this book (with the distinctive blue-and-white cover) in ""Notting Hill,"" too. Did you catch it? In the very last scene, Hugh Grant is reading it as Julia lies on his lap. Turns out, it's no coincidence. The same director is going to shoot the movie version of this magnificent novel. I only hope Nicolas Cage can fill Corelli's large and glorious shoes."
5,vividly written and haunting story,"A beautiful novel. I was touched by the desperation of their situation and the compulsion of the characters to do the right thing at the expense of their personal happiness. It's not a ""chick novel"", but I wept because of the uncontrollable tragedy that they endured."
5,Good beyond hope!,"I didn't know people still wrote stories like this in this cynical age of shortened attention spans. As others have commented, it will have you crying and shaking your fists in anger - sometimes simultaneously. The first few pages are a slog. The ending is flat and conventional compared to the wildly imaginative middle, but it is churlish for the diner to complain about the coffee when the chef has just served up such a magnificent meal.I do wish the author had supplied a glossary. This is the first book in living memory that required a dictionary to understand - and not always an english one at that! Email me at chowkwan@alumni.caltech.edu if you'd like a (partial) glossary.-- ray"
5,A stunning book,"It reminded me of ""100 years of Solitude"" by Marquez, masterful story telling with some truly wonderful passages of sublime prose. It had the feeling of truth, of a story that was real in a very human sense. It's been about a week since I read it yet it still says with me, the characters, the situations and the vivid rendering of the Greek island.A fantastic novel."
4,"Even when I put in down, it played in my mind all day...","I have recommended this book so often since I read it about five months ago. The author had a way of establishing a skepticism for the reader who then finds herself won over just like the natives of Cephallonia. The characters are charming and the many perspectives we get to know them (through the other character's eyes) make them seem like old friends.The title is perfect of how, despite the horrors or war, beauty cannot be ignored. It reminded me of The Very Long Engagement by Sebastien Japrisot, but I liked De Bernieres' work on a much grander scale. I am looking for more from him"
5,The best book I have ever read...........?,"I have to admit that I had never come across Loius de Bernieres until we read it for an A level paper this year. Never before have I felt such an extremity of emotions whilst reading a novel; love, hate, compassion, pity... I could go on forever. This truly compassionate story has captured the hearts of everyone I have recommended it to, and I have read it again and again. Each time, the depth of the characters becomes deeper. And the unconventional ending is what makes it such a masterpiece. Well done Louis."
1,Don't bother.,The only reason I finished this book was because it was reading for a book group. It is very slow reading till about pg 200. The ending stinks. Made me want to throw it against the wall!
1,What a load of garbage !!!!,"What a load of garbage !!!! This book depicts the British as the saviours of Greece and the Greek communists as savages. Though there was some excesses by the Greek communists, it pales in comarison to the deceit of the British metered out during and after the war. Also as always, western authors and (movie makers) depict the islands and Greece in an image they want to see. Never the image Greeks see of themselves. Non-Greeks would be surprised how different these two viewpoints can sometimes be. If people can stop romanticising about the characters and the love triangle, maybe they can buy a history book which tells them what actually did happen in that period."
1,old and tired,"Yet another old and tired love story that adds little to the genre - but what is so troubling is the typical caricature of the Greek as some swarthy illiterate AND the glaring inaccuracies of the politics of the time. Yes, it is fiction, but the author did not made an attempt to mask his political leanings. The real Corelli even had took issue with this book."
4,"For the book and the people, WWII's end is a bad thing","The introductory chapters are overwhemingly poetic. And the bulk of the novel, until the Italian surrender, is wonderful--working at all the levels needed to tell the story of the lovers, the friends, the country, and the war. Unfortunately, when the Italians are about to be given up to the Germans, Des Bernieres makes a radical shift in storytelling style whose austerity fails to accomplish what De Bernieres might have intended. The writing (and perhaps also, this reader) are not up to the challenge.And sadly, the concluding ~80 pages take yet another wrong turn. While they may have been an acceptable construction if presented by themselves, the painful lack of consonance with the first three-quarters of the book make them a dissatisfying read.The book is nonetheless a gorgeous and recommended read, but the glory is in the beginning and the middle, not the end."
3,overrated,"I read this book without having heard anything about it simply because my mother told me it was worth reading. While it certainly wasn't dreadful, I found it to be just okay. The beginning was enjoyable but during the last seventy pages or so, it became aggravating and inconsistent with the rest of the narrative. For some reason , I felt compelled to buy his first novel, ""The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts,"" and loved it, though it is consistently compared unfavorably to ""Corelli's Mandolin."" I found the ""The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts"" to be much more humorous, interesting, and overall a more enjoyable book. So I recommend to anyone who found themselves annoyed with ""Corelli's Mandolin"" but still enjoyed de Berniere's writing style to read his first novel."
3,great until the end..,"I loved this book, what a fantastic story and story teller. But the end was such a disappointment! I can handle sad endings or bad endings but this one was just plain frustrating, too simple and nonsensical for such a detailed story. It didn't go along with the rest of the book, it left me frustrated and sad. I would have otherwise scored this book with a higher rating."
3,"So beautiful, until it fell apart","I thought this was one of the best books I ever read until the last 100 pages. Then it felt like the author just ran out of steam and tried to quickly rush through and tie everything up, covering many years in the process. It just didn't work given the beauty and complexity of the story up to that point. If not for that, I would have given it five stars easily."
5,Read It Now!,"This novel has so many twists and turns you would think that you were being throttled by a snake. The time span of the novel is also amazing, being spread over a time span from pre war to almost present day. Comical yet in many parts disturbing, this is a must read book."
5,The Best Rap CD You've Never Heard,"Frankly, it would be wrong to call 'Plays With Toys' a rap CD. The only close thing to rap you find here, at least stylistically, is the rhythm of the vocals, which aren't really rap. Rather, they seem more rap-themed.Years before Wyclef unsucesfully tried to cover 'No Woman, No Cry' Michael Ivey was rapping over a guitar (yes, real instruments!) singing about women who've hurt him and how he drinks to forget about them. The mood is laid-back but not necessarily mellow. The drum beats keep pace with the music and keep you from relaxing too much... Smoking/drinking music is what some would call it.I just call it one of the most consistently perfect CD's in my collection, good for driving at night or kicking back on a rainy day. I highly recommend this CD to any fan of music."
3,"Did the job, but...","Sure wish that they had some plan, calmer colors to choose from, but if you have an elongated toilet seat - they don't make the covers anymore. So, if you want a cover, and some color, these work."
3,"Wanting a daughter, Needing a son- review from a adoptive parent","This book was good. I needed to fill some time while waiting to adopt our daughter in China. Although I did plow through this book I have to admit unless I was actually studying a certain demographic or had an academic interest in China and their ""one child"" policy I think it would be a somewhat ""dry"" read. Now, if you are intrested in the politics and culture, as well as the present, past and future reguarding the population and child bearing policy as well as domestic and international adoption; the book could be a good resourse. I have found it educational and indeed an asset in having a background on why my future daughter was given up by her birth parents in China and for answering the slew of questions I will be asked upon her arrival as I am sure many people in our community will have. This book is very helpful if you have ever wanted to know ""WHY""."
1,consider your audience,"The book was very disjointed and repetitive. I guess that each chapter was written as a separate journal article. It was a lot of facts and statistics, but there was one statement in the book that ruined it for me...""the availablity of ultrasoud makes the perfect outcome possible."" ..referring to the use of ultrasound for sex selection. I don't agree with the gov't regulations of reproduction in China, but I also don't agree with any endorsement of sex-selctive abortions. Anybody who buys this book is likely in the adoption process of one of these prescious little girls and has possibly gone through numerous infertility treatments. Probably not the best audience for pro-choice undertones."
5,Excellent African Experience,"After traveling around Africa for a summer years ago, I was eager to bring the musical sounds of the trip into my home. Each of these songs is so luscious, full of energy and beauty. Even someone who has never traveled to these vibrant lands can appreciate the diversity of each track, all of which are guaranteed to get you dancing and leave a smile on your face. I've not been back to Africa for five years, but I find myself reaching for this cd all the time, even for teaching yoga."
1,Not so good,"This lasted only a few months before it stopped working. It does not reflect the correct outdoor temperature nor does it keep time well, even after changing the batteries repeatedly. Deff. a waste of money"
3,Long and tedious,I saw a movie similar to this 10 years ago. This is a lame version of that one. Very boring and not worth watching.
3,A very funny dark comedy about a very dysfunctional family that will make yours seem normal. Very much worth watching. I say B,"""I bet we're the first family ever to be fired by their therapist"" After the mother (Davis) of a severely dysfunctional family has an accident and hits her head she wakes up with memory loss. She learns what she was like and what her family life was like and the entire family gets a chance to change. This is very very funny dark comedy. By very dark I mean it opens with someone accidentally hanging himself spying on the mother in bed. From there it gets darker and more and more strange. For those that like edgy humor seen in ""Death To Smoochy"" or newer movies like ""Peep World"" and ""Super"" then this one is for you. If you are easily offended I would stay away from this one. I however thought it was very funny. The only problem was that it got a little repetitive toward the end. Overall, a very funny movie that is not for everyone. I give it a B.*Also try - Peep World"
2,Pass,"I was thinking this film might touch a bit on the corruption and the inherently non-Western customs of Beijing, and how they related to the architects building the stadium, but mostly, it's a lot of random and ethereal statements (subtitled or in difficult-to-understand English) from either the architects or a few politicians. There's no meat to this film, and anyone wanting to really learn anything about the building of the Bird's Nest or about the culture in Beijing will be disappointed."
2,Cultural introspective,"The Bird's Next is exactly what you think it is. Except, the film is not really about the construction as much as it's about the process of getting the building built (e.g. culture differences between the architects and the locals). There are also a few side stories which go nowhere.Biggest problem with the movie is that it's very tough to read the subtitles sometimes. 1/2 the documentary has English subtitles which are in white and have no dark border. Every time the lower part of the screen is light (white) the subtitles are impossible to read.Anyway, it's fine. Again, it's what you think it will be."
3,Buy this CD just for the version of Freebird.,"It's not one of the bands best work, but this cd is worth owning"
4,Attractive and sturdy,"This clock/thermometer arrived in good condition. It looks great hanging on our lanai wall and it satisfied my every expectation. My only quibble is that the thermometer seems to be about 3 to 4 degrees off. I tested it against several other thermometers to be sure. The clock part is very accurate. Overall, a good buy."
3,Patio clock,"Prompt service from the company. The clock is as legible as I had hoped and is reasonably contemporary looking. Personally, I would have preferred it somewhat smaller with a narrower frame (half the width?) and temperatures should be in centrigrades as well as Fahrenheit (on the same dial)."
5,Best GF cracker ever!,I can't get these at my local grocer anymore.. They sale Nut-Thins just not these ones.. They are really really good and even my kids love them.. Great Purchase!
4,Balanced View of Urban Indians,"Joan Weibel-Orlando has provided a balanced and detailed study of American Indian migration into Los Angeles. The author accomplishes this without demonizing the Bureau of Indian Affairs' Employment Assistance Program, otherwise known as the ""relocation program"", which was responsible for facilitating training and employment opportunities for 30,000 Indian people in the greater Los Angeles area over a period of approximately 20 years. She demonstrates that while Indian people were confronted with some hardship in their transition to urban life, they adapted and created their own viable urban communities. She does not resort the polemics associated with calling the BIAs efforts in this area as ""cultural genocide"", a term frequently used by the American Indian Movement back in the 1970s."
4,"GREAT bedding, but no accessories","I bought this for my daughter at a high-end boutique. The blanket is so soft and you can actually use it. Most crib bedding you can not use the comforter, but this is just so soft and luxurious!! My daughter loves to cuddle with it. My only complaint is it has no accessories really!! You can get the mobile to match, but good luck with art work and all!!! For the price here I say it is a steal. I spent more than this on the set alone!!!"
5,"Excellent style, and an intriguing theory","This is one of the best books written by the world renowned Egyptologist and bible scholar. Osman's excellent style is captivating, and his logical approach is very convincing."
4,Very exciting blues/rock guitar,"Axe virtuoso Verheyen--who plays in a variety of rock and jazz styles--shows off his rock-oriented blues chops on this fine album. He also proves to be a good blues singer and songwriter. (Robben Ford fans will love the playing and perhaps, as I did, find Verheyen quite a bit more soulful as a singer.) Styles range from Muddy Waters to Cream to funky rock/blues. Then, at the end of the album, in a great change of pace, Verheyen delivers a sensational (almost Jackson Browne-like) acoustic folk tune called Silence is Golden--which he finishes with some uptempo country electric guitar playing that is truly beautiful. This album is a genuine pleaser. Highly recommended. (PS on stars--I use four stars for very good albums like this one; I save 5 for the proven classics--""Graceland"" and the like.)"
3,So-so Release,"Verheyen would do well on American Idol, his vocals are passable, nothing to complain about. His songwriting did not connect with me at all. You often here of players who are playing the blues but not sounding as if they feel it, and Verheyen, to me, is a classic example. He does play the guitar very well, don't get me wrong, but nothing spectacular. His vocals are merely along for the ride, and that's where we part ways. Not a bad release, by any means, just nothing to write home about."
3,"Fine Packaging, but a specialist item","And not being a ethno-musicologist, if that's the appropriate monicker, this fails to transcend regionalist boundaries, for me. The recording is good and the presentation first rate. The music remains pleasantly repetitive and the voices, nothing overly remarkable, given the quality of voices I have heard and remarked upon in these reviews over the years."
2,"It may have been alright, the second CD doesn't play in any of my players or computers.","I trusted the reviews on this page without hearing the work. Big mistake in the world music arena. I think often the positive reviews are from historical, local people, or intellectual fans. I was looking for inspiration more than authenticity and this doesn't do it. Listen before you buy and watch out for that second CD -mine was just a 'ringer'."
2,TOO CLUBBY!,"I have to say that, personally, I prefer darker/deeper progressive house and trance so maybe my review may not be that fair based on the Webster Hall series since these tend to be more main stream. However, When I envision Webster Hall in NYC (I was a med. student in NYC and did go to the Hall) I do think of more darker forms of music and atleast if it's going to be a clubby CD, then make the mixes good!! I did not like this CD at all. First the music was very boring and the mixing was suboptimal. I even gave the CD to a friend of mine who loves clubby music and even she said she did not like it. Trust me- you'll be waisting your money if you purchase this. If you want to hear a good Webster Hall CD- try the one mixed by Mike Rizzo (I'm not sure of the volume #)- I would give this 4.5 stars easily."
1,Faith in SPAM,"This title is currently being extensively SPAM-advertised, with particular reference to its availability on Amazon.My view is that if the author/publisher needs to resort to SPAM to drum up interest then that fact in itself speaks volumes for the work. On that basis alone I wouldn't touch it with a pole."
3,Why Didn't Anyone Say This Was a 6 Pack??,"I like this little book, but I only have it 3 stars because when it arrived, I was frustrated to find it to be a pack of 6 little books. I was hoping to give it as a gift, but it's more like something you'd put on top of a gift or something you'd send to someone just to say you're thinking of them. The book itself is good, but I wasn't looking for six of them!! I went back to the description to see if I'd missed this fact somewhere, but I coulnd't find it. I did see that Susan Branch's ""Little Bird Book"" is listed as a 6 pack, but this one had no such reference. If you're looking for a little something to send to friends, family, or garden lovers, this is a fun little book, but there's not much too it."
3,Pretty good US Shoegaze,"This might actually be better than Smashing Orange's singles collection ""1991"" though those singles got them more attention, at least in England. Here we have a well-produced mix of shoegaze and 3-chord rock, kinda-sorta like what the Dandy Warhols/Brian Jonestown Massacre would cook up years down the road. This is heavier than those bands and not particularly jokey. Highlites are generally the louder and catchier tracks: All Girls Are Mine, Something Comes Down, Look Behind You. For the price, this is easily worth getting and something of a lost US shoegaze semi-classic."
5,Light and delicate flavor,"This doesn't taste like pear to me, it just has a light, delicate, slightly sweet, and absolutely delicious flavor. It's one of my favorite teas."
3,It has a very faint pear taste,"I received it today and it's okay, but the flavor is a very faint taste of pear, so next time I will use 2 tea bags when I make it in a cup. I really like pear nectar, so I'm a bit disappointed. Also the other reviewer's caution NOT to steep it very long is correct. Since I have a 2 cup automatic tea pot, I let it stay on the heat and the second cup was really bitter. I guess the white tea is too delicate to keep heated. I think I will stick w/ only herbal teas or a chai black tea as neither have ever tasted bitter to me and have stronger flavors."
2,Slightly fun only because it's Superman,This game is pretty weak and repetitive. I only purchased it because I'm a huge Superman fan. I highly doubt that real gamers will find this game amusing.
4,catcher's helmet,"My daughter loves this helmet, it fits her head great, and it has prevented several hits to her head from softballs coming in. It has worked great for her and a great buy, too. You can not beat that combination."
4,Jessica,My brother love it and always use it!! it is a very good product if you love to play baseball
4,Good Catcher's Helmet,"Good visibility, 2-in one, good mobility, not difficult to take off. Good for moderately large heads. (L-XL) Somewhat insufficient throat protection."
5,I love this shoe because....,"it's funky enough to have an edge but classic enough to wear to work. The heel is what makes this shoe stand out and what makes it so fluevogish. They run a full size small so I got the 10. I was worried about buying them online because the sizing on vogs is so strange. I tried them on in the SF store adn sure enough the reviews I read online were accurate, you need to get a full size larger than normal. Trust me, I know it sounds scary and you think you will look like you have clown feet but they look and feel great, just order one size up."
5,Extraordinary recipes that are a delight to the palate.,"Full of unusual but consistently reliable recipes. This cookbook is now owned by many of my friends and my extended family. We get together and have Terrific Pacific potlucks several times a year. Although the recipes are sometimes complicated, their flavors are memorable. This cookbook makes a wonderful gift for the electic, experienced chef."
4,Looks Harder Than It Is,"I found Asian cooking to be slightly intimidating since the ingredients were unfamiliar and the process usually lengthy. But after working with a few of the recipies presented here, they looked harder than they actually were.Admittedly the first time I prepared one of the dishes, it took forever. It turned out great. And the reason it looked complicated and took me so long was the excellent job the authors were doing in thoroughly explaining the process. A simple recipe that may have taken me an hour the first time, now takes 15 minutes . . . and tastes fantastic.It's a good cookbook with some interesting recipes with detailed instructions."
1,Ouch!,A very average performance combined with the worst audio I've ever heard on a commercially released CD make this a guaranteed disappointment!
1,from a boz scaggs enthusiast,poor sound quality along with stale arrangements make for a dissapointing listen. i threw it out with yesterdays papers.
2,Returned - But Lovely,"The watch was very nice but I sent it back to Amazon. My husband gave it to me as a Christmas gift. However, I don't like stretch bands on watches and that is the type this has. So if you like a stretch band on a watch this is a very beautiful watch."
5,An excellent book covering all aspects of Networking,"This really is a great book. It covers practically every major principle of win/win networking imaginable and is an excellent guidebook for anyone who would like to learn how to master this valuable life and business skill.The authors are both successful business people who, as part of their businesses, utilize the very skills they teach in this book.Networking Magic will make an excellent gift for the college graduate, seasoned business pro, and everyone else who has a need to build a far-reaching network of valuable relationships and resources. The authors understand and communicate so well that the best and most successful networkers are those who take great pleasure in being an asset to others.Job well done!"
3,"It must be just me - but not a lot new, we just need to do it","Networking is over done in my estimation. It smacks of manipulation and using people for the wrong reasons. If you're into it probably a great book, just doesnt float my boat."
5,Very Satisfied,Showed up sooner than expected and very satisfied would recomend for any one to purchase from this individual
5,a great evangelist,keith green was a man WAY before his time. the album so you wanna go back to egypt was the frist contempery christian music album that I had ever had. I LOVED it. His music is SO inspiring and uplifting. I've been told that his sermans were just as good. I just wish I had been old enough to see him perform. It was indeed a very sad day when he died.
5,A fascinating study of how computer and video games may actually be beneficial to the children playing them,"""Don't Bother Me Mom--I'm Learning!"" by Marc Prensky (founder and CEO of Games2train) is a fascinating study of how computer and video games may actually be beneficial to the children playing them. Providing readers with an unique approach to contemporary games and their content, ""Don't Bother Me Mom--I'm Learning!"" delves deeply into the education benefits of gaming in the form of calculated risk taking, strategy formulation and execution, as well as addressing complex moral and ethical decisions in the midst of gameplay which may actually help children. ""Don't Bother Me Mom--I'm Learning!"" is very strongly recommended to all parents for its engaging analysis of children seemingly addicted to computer and video based gaming."
5,What Price Music ?,"This is a great album. The originals are superb and the covers are always enjoyable and more than adequate. But $45 for a single CD?! Import or no, Amazon must have struck some Faustian deal with a supplier to have to charge this amount.Who benefits? I guarantee you it's not Kenny Rankin. And it sure as hell isn't the consumer. It's price gouging like this that leads me to believe that the original Napster and other pirate download services might be a viable alternative.I love music (of all kinds), and when I see something like this I find it heartbreaking. There is no justification whatever for the $45.00 that is being charged for this CD.Rhino Records, please help! Reissue this great album that was released when music was at a turning point and Kenny Rankin was a contributer to the changes we and the music were going through."
5,Good history of the Old West,"Trails West is a good historical sketch of the Old West, and especially Colorado. I love the people who recreate history, especially my woman on page 19, the one holding the rifle."
3,Alright for $15.,It's not Need For Speed Underground 2 but what do you expect. You get what you pay for. I like that it has custom soundtracks and good graphics but the cars and trucks don't turn very good. It has 55 cars/trucks and 26 tracks. It does not have a in car dash view. The replays are fun to watch. The fact is it's a arcade racing game and if that's what you like then I recommend for you to pick it up. If you like a Sim racing game then wait for Forza Motorsport that comes out in May.
5,Screen Gems-the best and original television studio!,"This book provides the most accurate and interesting history of the original television studio that brought the industry to life and for nearly four and a half decades brought us our favorite classic sitcoms. They defined the television industry as being the first Hollywood studio-owned company to produce television programs. It may be outdated, but it is an excellent look at this ancient television studio!"
2,Blah,Ottmar - you made me swoon at your Sacramento Concert. Love thoes bare feet! Love you. It pains me to say it but this is nothing compared to your other works and how the movements interplay with each other.
3,good book,"This book was a bit slow for me, but I think it is just because I read it right after reading 19 minutes by Jodi Picoult. Can't compare the two books. The characters are likeable, and very believeable. Keeps your attention. I could relate to Leah more then to Andrea. I hope I never have to relate to Andrea. Found out that it is hard to be patient while others greif can last months to years."
3,Red Runs the River,"It is not the best film produced by BJU, but it does have a good message.If you are looking for professionalism, you would not be satisfied."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CD,"Ignore the other review posted here. This CD is a complete and total waste of time and money. NONE of the performances here are the original ""hit"" versions, and most annoyingly, the bulk of them are sound-alike versions performed by a studio group. A most glaring example of the cheesy quality of this CD is how the record label spells the name of the group The Trammps (they are listed as ""The Tramps"" throughout!)In summary, this title joins the trash heap with other titles put out by this label, Park South. I find it hard to believe that a major label (EMI) chooses to distribute the bargain-basement quality titles released by this label."
