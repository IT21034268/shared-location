5,Excellent product,"I have this on my second inlet of my DC, and it works great. Just wish it had a built in blastgate..."
3,Goes flat pretty quickly,"I bought this for my office chair as I sit at the computer sometimes as long as 14 hours a day, and my tailbone area can get sore. This thing was thick and seemed great at first, but after about a week of using it every day, now when I sit in it, I sink practically down to my chair underneath. And I am not heavy, I am 5'3 and 130lbs. I imagine if you're in a wheelchair you spend even more time there than I do in my chair, so I definitely would not recommend this product."
2,wheel chair cushion,"This cushion was great until I washed it. It shrunk a little which affected the look and lines of the cushion. Plus, it was a pain to get the cover back on. Very comfortable to sit on, hard to maintain."
1,Horrible!,"I ordered this cushion for my Grandmother and when it was shipped to me, I received an inflatable butt donut. I understand this could have possibly been a shipping mistake, but for the money I spent, I could have bought 10 of those cheap inflatable cushions at the medical supply store. Until my money or cushion is refunded or replaced I would never recommend this to anyone!"
5,Cool book on a cool product!,"I've been a HUGE fan of Sniffer for years. I use it ALLTHE TIME to figure out and fix stuff on my networks. I learned how to use it by playing around with it--which is always fun, and reading what I could find on the Web. I never saw a real book on Sniffer Pro before, so I figured I would see what the experts had to say. These guys helped me out a TON with this book. I knew how to do a lot of things before, but now withe this book I think I know it ALL. Thanks :)"
5,Awesome Reference,"I am a Network Engineer with about 6 years experience in networking and systems. This book is really cool. I have worked on so many networks that needed to be repaired and I wish I had this book years ago when I started learning. This book will not fail you. You will learn how to use the Sniffer, Troubleshoot with it, analyze with it, and best yet, you learn how to find problems in networks and this book tells you how to fix or redesign based on what the problem is. This is one of the better troubleshooting books I have seen. I also like the fact that the authors all work for fortune 500 companies, are certified as Sniffer Experts and CCIE level, how can you go wrong with this book? Hope this helps you as this book has helped me."
4,This book is really helpful,"I wanted to write a review to say that I have used this book, and I think it is really helpful. I would have given it 5 stars only if it had gotten deeper into filters, but according to the Sniffer objectives for the exam - you really didnt have to get too deep into filters - but it would have helped more as a reference. Also, this book not only helped me to pass my SCP test, but has helped me with the SCE exams too which was an unexpected bonus. I pretty much passed my first SCE exam with this book and some online resources. This book is a cool read and I hope you find it helpful too for your SCP."
1,Disappointed in this book,"I read this book, and found that the author really didn't have any hands on experience with this product."
4,Not Bad,It fits perfect but the OS didn't recognize it at once. I had to shut down and reboot a couple of times until it did. And somehow it runs the first 4% of total charge very fast.
2,Glad I didn't pay retail,"Very interesting subject matter but no real ""plot"" for what is supposed to be a novel."
3,Down and Out,"If you are from the Wilkesboro, North Carolina area, this novel may hold some passing interest. That angle alone guarentees some sales. Also, the work could appeal to those intrigued by the experiences of Asians who moved to the United States in the 19th century. Otherwise, try another read. Life is a bit short for mediocrity.I found it to not fulfill what the professional reviews indicated. Admittedly the subject matter does inspire inquisitiveness, but the intimate scenes had an obligatory, forced feel to them.Some members of my reading group had trouble pulling through, and several didn't finish the book. The structure, with its alternating time frames, strained under its own demands to the point of arching formulaic. Final impressions were that this book was written with the goal of selling books rather than creating something original or informative. In no way does this reflect upon the subject matter, but rather its treatment."
3,If you want your voyeuristic side satisfied.. . .,"this is the book for you. Strauss knows that as soon as anyone hears that Chang and Eng were married and had 21 children between them the possible ""mechanics"" of that situation immediately spring to mind. Strauss does not let the reader down--he describes their sex lives vividly and dwells extensively on Chang's problem with alcohol. For all that though, I found some of the characters strangely flat. Eng's wife Sarah was not in a scene in the entire book when she did not complain about stomach problems. It was repetitive in the extreme. Chang's alcoholism also was described so often and in such detail that it became monotonous.I found the narrative structure very choppy, as it jumped between their lives as young men and the present lives they led as old men and slaveholders.An okay book, but deeply flawed in many ways."
3,A wonderful yet disturbing read,"""Chang & Eng"" is a beautifully written book, but I also found it a rather disturbing read. I could not help but over identify with Eng's desire to be separate. If it's possible to feel claustrophobic while reading that's what I experienced. I kept visualizing ripping the twins apart primarily because I find it so inconceivable to live a happy life like that. While it's nice that they got married, had a large family and became successful farmers, the freak show scenes made me incredibly sad. I also had a problem with the ""historical fiction"" aspect. I wanted to know the truth...what REALLY happened to them. But we'll never know and I found that frustrating. Strauss is an EXCELLENT writer and he does an incredible job of making their story real. But for some reason, I just couldn't get past the fact that it wasn't. I guess I personalized this book a bit too much."
3,Sad. Unrelentingly...sad.,"I had to force my way through this novel. The premise...loss of independence, loss of privacy, loss of identity...was enough to depress me time and again. (It still has that effect now, writing this review.) So I have to admit a bias.It wasn't entertaining. It was well-written, thoughtfully executed...but not entertaining.But then, how entertaining can something be when you're wincing so often you need either shiatsu or a chiropractic session every time you turn the page?As a d√©but, 'Chang and Eng' is a fabulous indicator of Mr. Strauss's talent. I'm looking forward to the rest of his novels...which I happen to have beside me right now.But I won't ever be going back to re-read this one.Personal rating: 7/10"
3,Not What I Had Hoped,"I loved the premise behind this book; I've always found the phenomenon of conjoined twins fascinating. I thought the story moved slowly and was alittle difficult to follow. I ultimately put the book down when I realized that for most of their lives, the brothers were treated as freaks and as less than human. I couldn't bear to read about the cruelty that was so much a part of their lives. I wanted to find the courage to continue, but found the subject too upsetting."
3,Symbolism triumphs over history.,"Darin Strauss doesn't cheat the reader. He lets you know that his version of Chang and Eng's life does not correspond to the known history of the ""Siamese Twins."" But by giving voice to Eng's interior life without trying to stay within the framework of that life, I felt that Strauss was taking the easy way out. Working towards an understanding of the complexities of the life of a conjoined twin, Strauss succeeds admirably in giving Eng a voice that compels the reader to care for him and his brother. The problem lies in the soap opera elements of their relationship with their spouses and the idea that Strauss needed to change the facts to better fit his goals for the characters. A historical novel dealing with actual people need not pay lip service to history to tell the story. An interesting novel, worth your time, but I prefer historical novels to try to stay as close to the facts as possible."
4,Fills in the Emotional Gaps of Their Story,"This fictionalized account tries to fill in where history has failed us - to know what it FELT like to be Chang and Eng. The book is well written, but I don't feel that the author gets as deeply in the the heads of the twins as he might have. It is still an interesting read - with truly bizarre sex scenes... I wouldn't buy it, but it's definitely worth checking out from the library."
4,An Amazing Story,"If you are looking for a truly original book, look no further. What a brilliant concept. Telling an imagined story behind the true life co-joined twins that gave rise to the words ""Siamese twins"". Obviously connected, but with two heads, sets of arms, legs and most else, this novel manages to get into the heads of two distinctly different people -- both inhabiting the same body. At times a sad story, at times a touching love story, and at times a period piece involving P.T. Barnum, Chang and Eng's story is unlike many other novels out there. The author covers a lot of distance, from their birth to the death -- including their passage to America, their sideshow/freakshow tours -- and their courtship of two women who would bear them 22 children between them."
4,"Interesting, but somewhat unsettling","Chang and Eng is the fictionalized account of the Siamese twins, Chang and Eng Bunker who were famous world wide in the mid 1800's. Told from the viewpoint of Eng, it folows the brothers from their beginnings on the Mekong River to the sideshows, and later the salons and drawing rooms of Europe. The brothers later would marry sisters and settle in North Carolina. At its heart, this is a story of brothers, their love, their differences, their competition and the unbreakable bond. I was a bit constrained by the small voice in my head that kept saying ""It's not polite to stare."" The language is a delight to read."
3,decent review from a descendent,"As a descendent of the twins (Eng being my great, great, great-grandfather) I am always interested in reading about the twins and trying to learn more about their lives. As it is impossible to go back and learn just how they coped with their situation, I found Strauss' imagination captivating and a good read. I am curious why some facts were changed and others not. I enjoyed the book overall and would recommend it. Thank you."
4,Another Winner,"Edith Layton is one of a handful of romance writers whose work is always excellent; whenever I see her name on a book, I know I'm in for a treat. Her latest installment is no exception. She builds an interesting love triangle with believable characters, and she follows faithfully the strictures of the Regency era as to honorable behavior. She has a real feel for that period in history, and she does not attempt to ""modernize"" it as so many lesser writers of the genre do. It was a pleasure to encounter several characters from her previous novels and hazard a guess as to which ones will be featured in her next book. (I'm guessing the lady Annabelle, the third point of the love triangle.) If you are a fan of the Regency period and good writing in general, this is a must read."
4,Another Winner,"I have every book by Edith Layton, and this book was another winner. My only critique is that it wasn't long enough. I loved the heroine and the reappearnce of some of my favorite characters."
3,As basic as it gets,"If all you need is more outlets in a rack mounted unit, then this will do. I had to open mine up for a custom installation so I got to look at the internals. Simple outlets wired one to another, no filtering, no conditioning of any kind. But, it works and it's cheap."
4,good enough,"I use these as PDUs on the bottom of my 12u racks.I connect them to cyberpower UPS, so I am not concerned about the lack of surge protection.The ears were a little bent on one of the units I bought, but it was easily bent back into place.They come with a plastic cover over the power switch, which is not shown in the pictures. It's ugly, cheap, and not necessary. I've been able to rip mine off with no damage to the unit. I treat my equipment with caution and respect, and I've never had a problem with accidentally switching the power off.Basically you get what you pay for. This is a simple unit, and it will get the job done."
5,Well made PDU,"Looks and feels solid, installs perfecty on my On-Stage Rack Stand! I wish I would have known that there is a version with built-in surge suppression (1215RMS) for $1 more.Package arrived in perfect condition, too!"
2,Don't bother,"I have tried using this unit for about 30 days in my home recording studio. First off as others have stated: this thing is packaged poorly. I should have listened to the reviews on this site and others speaking about the cracked power switch cover, as mine was damaged also. Plus one of the rack ears was damaged most likely in shipping from poor packaging. But these two things were not deal breakers. The main deal breaker is the incessant BUZZING from this loud annoying thing. I mean seriously! It is loud, and for a studio intolerable. Back to Amazon it goes. Thank goodness for Amazons excellent return policy since there are pieces of junk out there like this. I gave two stars because it looks cool. I am being VERY liberal. Advice: Get something else."
5,Good Rack-mounted Power Strip.,"Excellent quality and specifications. The cord is long enough to mount high on an 84"" rack."
5,CPS-1215rm,"Solid Construction, looks nice in my network rack.. Basically a $40 power strip with a bracket on the sides. Power supply cord is nice and heavy gauged."
2,"Cheap, but rack ears shipped attached and arrived bent","I bought two of these, and while the build quality is fine, one of them arrived with a badly bent rack ear because they were attached during shipping. Even with some massaging, the bent ear will never fit flush into a rack.I also took off a star for having a power switch, a feature that seems to invite disaster without utility. I bought this knowing it had a power switch, however--I was looking for the cheapest possible PDU without surge or other features.On the bright side, the cord is long and the PDU will solve my problem of managing power on some of my test equipment.The PDU is cheap, but makes some compromises to get there."
3,Beautiful Screen But Super Slow,I owned this laptop for over a year. The screen is excellent and my wife and I love watching movies in bed. The computer runs very slow on vista in terms of transitioning from log in identities and also at start up. I have not had any problems with this PC but we consider ourselves light users because the laptop does not move much. Battery life now runs about 1.5 hours if that.Memory upgrade: pay close attention to your memory upgrade purchase. This laptop only supports 2 GB max (Vista 32 bit) and you must use both slots (1GB per slot). I tried to upgrade to 4GB of Crucial memory but the following happened: 1). Laptop did not start with both 2GB slots full. 2). I had to put the 2GB module in the lower slot (one nearest pc board) or the laptop would not start up. It did not recognize the 512MB stick in the top slot. I lost my wireless connection and the computer did not run any faster. I think I also had a low battery issue.
3,gum,"product is ok; i bought because i thought it was on the hcg diet. however, i found it had oil in it so it wasn't recommended. i wouldn't have spent so much if i had known that!"
2,Exorbitant Shipping Charge,"Don't know how I missed the $5 shipping charge for this $2.45 pack of stevia sweetened chewing gum. Must have been tired and got sloppy.The gum tastes okay but is one-third smaller than American gum products. Oh well, nothing ventured, nothing gained. That $5 shipping charge still hurts."
2,Tuff..,The gum is hard and the flavor does not las but a few minutes. It is a shame this is the only gum with stevia . Very expensive.
2,not so good,Taste is horrible and it doesn't last very long either. It is strong at first but only lasts for less than half a minute. Almost not worth the buy.
2,very loud and heavy,"I've had this laptop for about 3 years. It hasn't been dropped at all. I thought it was pretty good at first, but I've been having problems with it for the past year. First off this is a heavy laptop compared to those they have out now. It is quite bulky. It won't even close anymore (the closing latch broke while it was in my laptop case). The left click button for the mouse pad broke (whenever I click on it, it would get stuck and cause it to double click or not click at all). The most annoying thing about it is how loud it is! I took it to lectures sometimes but it got so embarrassing since all I can hear is the loud humming from the fan. Those sitting next to me have even commented on it. Don't even think about getting this model!"
2,Universal?,"I expected more from Delta. While the mechanism that turns the wheels runs smooth, the large wheel needed to be dresses up. It is very soft, so much wheel is lost during sharpening if you are not careful. The drain plug for the water basin is far too small. The tool rest for the dry grinder is cheap stamped steel, what you would expect from a cheap import. The tool rest for the wet wheel was is cast aluminum (no rust) but instead of using a milling machine to surface it, they used a belt sander, so it is not very smooth, which causes tools being sharpend and the cheap sliding miter to catch while sliding back and forth. If you are looking to sharpen hand planer blades, or wood chisels it is difficult to get a straight edge with this ""grinder"", but it puts a nice edge on an ax (so does a good whetstone for far less $$)."
4,It does the job,"I got no more than I expected. I would have loved the Tormek instead, but I was not prepared to pay that price. This Delta is a good compromise -- i.e., it beats having no slow-speed, wet grinder at all. Some problems: Out of the box, the 10"" wheel needed truing and the aluminum tabletop needed to be sanded smooth. On the other hand, after taking care of those problems, it does the job it was intended to do, which is put a straight edge and a clean bevel on my woodworking chisels and plane irons. I am not convinced you can do any better for the same price, so from a value standpoint, I rate it good."
2,"Not Bad, Not Great","I've had the Delta for over a year now and am a little disapointed w/ the grinder. As in the other reviews, the wet wheel is very soft, and in the year of avg to light use, the 10"" wheel is now probably around 7"" (or less). You MUST dress the wet wheel frequently or else end up with a pretty severe oval (trust me on this one!). The dry wheel wasn't bad but I did need to add the Veritas Grinder Tool Rest to make it really useful. Plus, you will need a good set of stones (I prefer water) to truely hone your edge.In hind site, I would rather have bought a regular Bench Grinder (i.e. Baldor). You have much more flexability in the type of wheels that you can get for grinding (shaped, silicon carbide, felt, leather, ...) unlike the 2 stones here."
1,I expected much better from Delta,"I havd owned this grinder for about six months and I am ready to throw it in the trash. To start with, the wheel is too soft and requires frequent trueing.This is particually a problem when you have to stop and true while working on a blade because it changes the grinding angle. The rpm's are too slow. With soft wheel and the low rmp's it can take over a hour to grind a blade. Cleaning up is also a problem. You have to take the wheel well off to clean out the residue of the wheel, which is considerable because the wheel is so soft.I can turly say I can find nothing redeeming about this tool!"
5,"Great alternative quick cooking ""starch"" for dinner","If you are looking for a healthy alternative for potatoes or noodles or white rice, Hodgson's whole wheat couscous is it. After you boil the water it takes 5 minutes of standing and that's it. You can add ingredients to ""spice"" it up. I wasn't able to find it in my local stores so I am very happy to find it on Amazon..Hodgson Mill Whole Wheat Couscous, 11-Ounce Units (Pack of 8)"
2,A respected work--by a convicted Nazi,"Like many, I regarded Kittel's work with respect ... but now, I am uncertain. Kittel was very anti-semitic and was tapped by Hitler to help make the Nazi's diabolical plans against the Jews theological palatable to German Christians. After the war, Kittel was convicted and imprisoned for his service to der Fuhrer and the Nazis. I cannot help but suspect that his strong antisemitism compromised his scholarship--scholarship of a Holy Book that was written almost entirely by Jews and from a Jewish frame of reference."
2,"""Theological"" Indeed.","I was somewhat disappointed after buying this 10 volume set. Though Kittel gives his all - around views of certain words, that method turned out to be his biggest problem. You will get 3 to 20 POSSIBLE answers to every Greek word addressed in the New Testament by Kittel. Unlike Greek lexicons, Kittel's take on meanings of words leaves one scratching his head. To anyone making a defence of certain theological positions, stick with Old and New Testament lexicons instead of Kittel's theological slants."
4,So far so good,"I was a little worried readi g all the reviews. But I installed the shower curtain rod yesterday and it. Is really holding ! I have a 5 year old who at some time can be a little bit more rough and it's still holding ! Looking nice too, when you hold it it feels a little cheap , because it's solight but I guess it's part of it!I was shocked to see how amazon is wasting packaging on it!! It came in a huge box. And had a lot of paper filling...not very environmental. Friendly!!!"
4,"Works, but it's noisy!","This is a functional tension rod and matches my other bathroom fixtures. Seems like it would hold up even a fairly heavy curtain. Only caveat is that, not surprisingly at this price, the metal is kind of cheapy-thin- visually you can't tell, but I bought roller hooks to go with it and the noise definitely gives it away!"
3,Odd looking,I have had this for a few months now and must say I just don't like the looks or feel of it. If I had seen this in a store I would not have purchased it. The end pieces look like eggs. They are way too large and cheap looking. I only kept it because it was in the hall bath and I didn't have to look at it everyday and it does hold up the shower curtain. My son uses that bath and said he doesn't like the big end pieces either.
4,BE WARNED!!,"I love this book, BUT it is definantly only for the Zeppelin fanatic. A lot of the pictures included in this book can be found in some of the less pricey books. If you need it soon find another book. It took almost 18 week for me to get my copy. ""Live Dreams"" is a beautiful book with pristine pictures and stories that you can only find here. It has some one of a kind pictures and a detailed cover that makes this book feel like a treasure. If you truely LOVE Led Zeppelin than this book is worth the extra money and waiting."
2,Where;s Bonzo!!!,"When I first got the book and open it there was Jimmy, then Robert, then Jones, then, where the heck is Bonzo!! I purchased this used so I thought the previous owner took out some pages. So I look to see if there was a page missing and I could not find anything. So I read some other reviews and no there is no Bonzo. Lame!!!! Even the rest of the group said there is no Led Zeppelin without Bonzo. If I would have paid full price for this book, I would have been sending it back. Makes no sense!! Paid under $20 including shipping so can't complain to much, but still, give me a break!!!"
5,caffeine is a vitamin carsters,I gave this item for a gift and they were very pleased with it. They stated how great they will be in the summertime.
2,Lame easy-listening,"Anita Bryant never wrote any of her own material. Nor did she play any instruments on her recordings. She was the typical ""marionette"" kind of performer of her era. Just a pretty (ish) face to smack on the cover of a record, and thereby sell it. Pure cheesecake, that will make you throw up (and that's before you discover that she's now a religious psycho in the Reverend Phelps mold."
5,Foundations for future Death/Black/Thrash Metal,"This album is supberb in all respects...this is one of the first where it all began. Quorthon (an company??) have outdone themselves. The production, especially the guitar/drum/bass sounds I think does have an eerie similarity to Metallica's Ride The Lightning...(am I the only one who thinks this??)...This is definetely a great thing though as that album as everyone knows is a classic as well...anyway back to Bathory...this album rules. Varied tempos...and the title track experimenting with the future sound of Bathory's full blown 'Viking Metal' era. I wrote this review after one week and a day of Quorthon's Demise...R.I.P. Great one. BATHORY will be sadly missed but will live on in Valhalla eternally!"
5,Classic 1980's black/speed metal,"This is arguably Bathory's finest album. The production, while not perfect, is better than most other Bathory albums. Excellent black/speed metal songs like ""The Golden Walls of Heaven"" are sandwiched in between the Viking-mythology epics ""A Fine Day To Die"" and the title track. The songwriting here is much more complex than it is on earlier albums such as ""The Return"", where many of the songs sounded similar to each other. The drumming on this album (played by Quorthon?) is far better than on earlier Bathory releases; this combined with the improved sound make ""Blood Fire Death"" an awesome album."
1,THIS MOVIE REALLY IS ABOUT THE DUMBEST TAPE ALIVE,THE MOVIE Extreme Machine is really not good mainly because the way the format is made it really scrows up the whole entire tape.
2,Not 30 lbs!!!!!,This is a great travel item if your pet is under 5 lbs! I bought 2 of these; both for my 2 small (about 8 lbs each) and they didn't fit! Just be aware that this carrier is VERY small!
5,Journey rocks,"The escape album really showcases Journey as THE arena band of the 80's and beyond. One would be hard pressed to find a band better. Steve Perry, ""the voice,"" is almost unbelievable, his range is amazing. Neil Schon is razor sharp on lead guitar, Ross Valory has amazing bass lines. Jonathon Cain brings his amazing key board sound to band that already has a big sound. Steve Smith is the anchor on drums. Stone in Love absolutely rocks, and the classics, Don't Stop Belivin and Open Arms are such great tunes. Get this album and turn up the volume."
5,The Great Escape !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love it! Brings back the memories from my youth ! The sound is fantastic and the live versions give it interest ! I rocked on for days to Who's Cryin now! A great album from a band that still sounds hot!
5,PURE heaven scent,"This company makes the best scented diffusers out there. The scents are not overwhelmingly perfumed like most other diffusers. This scent, Noel, is so subtle and pure, I can walk in my home 9 months after I purchased it and still smell it! It smells like a fraiser fir fresh fresh cut tree!"
4,Helped to get my GED,Really has alot of info and really easy to read and understand really helped me get my GED would reccommend this to anyone whos wanting to get some helpful info
1,Worst thing Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz did,"This edition of ""The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour"" just plain stinks. The Mertzes are written out after the first scene, and don't come back until the very end, removing two enjoyable characters. Lucy and Ricky are given the same cabin as Howard Duff and Ida Lupino, only it takes at least 25 painful minutes of unfunny comedy for each couple to realize this. Ida Lupino is written like an idiot and she should have refused to do this. As a huge fan of ""I Love Lucy,"" this was especially difficult to watch. Most scripts, even the weakest, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz seem to be able to save. For some reason, this one isn't one of them. Poor character development, an unrealistic portrayal of the guest stars, and it really comes out to be a one-joke show anyway. Get this only to complete a collection. This episode just plain stinks."
5,Time Well Wasted,"Once again Brad Paisly has recorded a variety of songs that not only inspire, tell a tale, evoke emotion or make you ignore the fact that passing cars can see you singing and pounding on the steering wheel. I can't say that I care for the naration at the end of the CD, since it is a bunch of good ol' boys just sitting around mumbling. I could go hang with my own husband if I wanted that. But the first 14 songs or so are to be downloaded and saved forever. ""When I get to Where I'm going,"" with Dolly Parton, is just beautiful. Those of us who have lost someone we loved, find peace in this particular recording. It makes me smile as tears well in my eyes.Fern StatonPollock Pines, Ca."
3,Not as good as the first three,"I love Brad Paisley's music, and I think he is a step in the right direction for country music. Most other artists lack his talent and sound more like pop than country. Unfortunately this album doesn't have the same quality as his first three. There are funny songs (Alcohol, Flowers), and there are some great love songs (The World, Waitin' on a Woman), but the rest of the songs don't measure up to his previous albums. Half of the songs on here are pretty boring and full of cliche. Most of the songs on here are straight country. He doesn't experiment with bluegrass or spirituals as much as in previous albums. Also, the bonus track ""cornography"" is pretty tasteless. As a Christian artist, I don't like to see him stoop to this level. If you are a Brad Paisley fan, I would definitely get it, but if you're looking for his best stuff, get one of his first albums."
4,It's growing on me!,"I loved ""Mud on the Tires"" so much I was a little disappointed when I first listened to this album. But over time, I'm really coming to appreciate it. I really enjoy the way Paisley writes music -- there's usually some surprise embedded in the song, whether it's in the words or the music. He doesn't go for the easy cliche' very often, which is something that bothers me about other country music.My favorite track on this album is ""Rainin' You' - he delivers it with such a personal, understated approach that I can really feel the bittersweet misery of the ""narrator."" I could do without ""Cornography,"" though! Replace it with another good, solid song!"
3,Definitely not pop-country,"Brad Paisley's got an awesome steady deep voice, and plays a mean guitar. This album though is not for people who like the more pop-rock sounding country songs. I love the released tracks, ""The World,"" ""When I Get Where I'm Going"" and ""Alcohol,"" as they are more mainstream, but the rest of the CD is for people who like real honkytonk music. (And if you like the ""real"" country sound, Brad's fantastic.) ""Time Warp"" is instrumental and is pretty fascinating to listen to. So if you're more of a Brooks and Dunn fan than a Faith Hill fan, you'll probably like this CD."
5,Brad's best yet,"There are not enough words to describe how fantastic this album is. Living in England it's taken me a week or so to get hold of Brad's new CD and it was worth the wait.I've been a fan of Brad since Who Need's Pictures when I visited Nashville back in 99 and got all of his music. (at our wedding last year our first dance song was Little Moments) I definitely think this is his most consistent album to date with such a strong collection of songs.I can't really pick out any weak tracks, although highlights are Waitin' on a woman, Out in the parkin' lot, Rainin' You (which is amazing), When I get where I'm going and Time well wasted. I even love Time Warp which was really not what I was expecting. Even my wife who is not a country music fan likes Brad's music. I would recommmend this album to anyone!!"
1,"Falling Star! Wow, what happened Brad? Bad Album","Of course I purchased this without previewing any of the songs because it's ""Brad Paisley."" What a mistake! Really bad song writing! Bad Song Selection for an album! Horrible attempt at humor and I'm wondering if Little Jimmy Dickens will continue to get speech therapy on all of Brad's albums. I'll be selling my copy of this new CD.....it's junk!"
1,What's happened to Country Music?,"Not sure why they would release this album in this shape. Sounds like a mix between Urban and Black, with alot of old tired riffs. Where is the Brad Paisley with the rockin' guitar sound? The producers never even feature 1 song where his playing takes control. The jazz into on the instrumental song is the best part of this whole album. I saw Brad at the Oprey way back when, and I must say I knew he would be a star, but this album is sooo lack-luster, very disappointing.Regards."
1,Disappointed,"I've never been a big Brad Paisley fan, but with all the popularity surrounding him lately, I thought I would give his new cd a chance. Still nothing spectacular that makes me want to listen to him. It was definitely 'money wasted'."
3,"It didn't hurt, but I can't be too foolhardy.","There aren't not very many things Brad ""Shower Spoiler"" Paisley can't not but not do. Six of them include covalent bonds. Having said that, I didn't not say it - COULDN'T not, really, and that's what makes this album so special.From the opening song, there are quite a few other sounds that lead up to a gut-wrenching performance by Brad ""Tollbooth Plunderer"" himself. This is followed by more and more, then multiple (I counted a multiplicity), and after a brief lull, there's a song about that very thing. Does Brad know how, or what?!?!hahahaAll in all, this isn't why my good friend Jerry chose Pepsi, but it will get your toes tappin' and your ears tappin', and also your neighbors arrested, probably, unless you found something out I didn't already believe.Good Hovind"
3,Good ol' country music,This is a good album of solid classic style country music. I hadn't tried any music by this artist and bought the album without any preconceived notions about it. It's enjoyable. Only thing - it has these tracks that are just a few seconds long with mumbling on them that I don't get and dont like.
5,...and money well spent!,"I had heard Ticks last summer and thought I would give this CD a try while waiting for 5th Gear to be released. I love every track on this CD. From Paisley's tongue & cheek lyrics to the soulful ballads, I enjoy his music. I am surprised I have not worn it out yet. This turned me in to a big Brad Paisley fan and I now own everything he has released without any remorse. Great guitar playing and lyrics that have real meaning. I look forward to many years of great music from this very talented musician. This album is my favorite so far."
4,All but the Cornography,Loved everything about this CD EXCEPT the stupid Cornography tracks. Had nothing to do with Paisley and his music. The space was better served with another song. What was up with those idiot tracks????
4,Great,I bought this CD for just a couple of songs but it turned out to be one of the few CD's that I like every song on the album. I have listened to it over and over again and have not gotten bored. Another great one from Brad Paisley. He seems to just get better and better with time.
3,1 Great Cut,"Brad Paisley's Time Well Wasted features the best country music recording of the past year and one of the best ever, When I Get Where I'm Going, featuring the great Dolly Parton. That cut alone makes the CD worth the purchase price. That's a good thing because the rest of the album is a disappointment. It's not that the other cuts are bad, they're just not that good. I have too much good music to choose from to settle for mediocrity. When I play the CD in my car, I find myself skipping over the other cuts to get to the Parton duet, listening to it at least twice, and then skipping to the next disc in my player."
4,"Sad That the Song, ""Waitin' On A Woman"" Does Not Include Mr.Andy Griffith...","Today Is One Of Blessings~Three Nephews Are Celebrating Birthdays! Then, The Loss Of The Iconic Mr.Andy Griffith@ Age 86.I Remembered This Was A Video For CMT That I Would See & Enjoy The Leisure Of This Elder Statesman w/Mr.Brad Paisley.It was w/ Regret To Know This Song On This CD DOES NOT Include Mr. A. Griffith's Contribution. I Am Bereft Already, Sadly This Brings Sorrow That Much Closer To Not Hearing His Lovely Voice On This Recording.One, I Will Chose To Pass This Time Around.Hopefully, Mr.Paisley WILL Correct This Over~Sight In A Future Album To Include One Of The Most Beloved Men In America's Rich, Full History."
5,WHEN I GET WHERE I'M GOING,"WELL, HERE I AM AGAIN...I GOT THIS CD BECAUSE IT HAS THIS SONG ON IT & HAVING JUST LOST MY SON, THE WORDS REMINDED ME OR HELPED ME KNOW WHERE HE IS NOW....WALKING BESIDE HIS GRANDFATHER & FLYING FREE LIKE AN EAGLE & FISHING WITH HIS UNCLE...ETC. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SONG. CLAUDIA aka..MOM"
5,Fatastic lyrics and tunes,"Time Well Wasted is the best Paisley yet. The lyrical range is phenomenal from the fantasticly funny Alcohol, You Need A Man Around Here, and Flowers, to the gut-wrenching on When I Get Where I'm Going.The tunes are top-notch toe tappin too. ""The World"" starts the CD off on a upbeat and the well-known combination of Paisley's vocals with Dolly Parton on When I Get Where I'm Going is unforgettable."
4,"""Time NOT Wasted""","I thoroughly enjoyed this CD and recommend it to anyone who is a big country fan and enjoys Brad Paisley. His songs are very uplifting, some have stories to them and some are very inspirational. I listen to Brad Paisley at work and he can really help me through a rough night."
4,"Not the best Charpentier Te Deum, but good value for price","This CD is shorter than the Te Deum CD released by harmonia mundi France, performed under the direction of William Christie, but its contents, aside from the headlining 'Te Deum' are different, and the performance quality and recording quality is comparable, and the price is far more attractive. Since Naxos has done an entire series on Charpentier's sacred works, this CD, as part of that economy set, is well worth the investment."
2,Strengths and Weaknesses,"Barbara Watkins has developed some great bones, or outline, of a story. There's a good plot and stong external conflict. It just needs to be fleshed out.As a new author, she struggles with some of the same things we all have had to learn. There's a tendency to tell more than show, and there are some POV issues as well. A professional editor would have helped the read move along a little easier.My hat is off to any author who believes in their work and takes action to bring it to life. However, my opinion is that this book was published a little before it was ready. There's promise, though, and some deeper development would lead to a stronger presentation."
5,love it,Shostakovich at some of his dramatic best. I get completely lost in this piece. The quality on this recording is surprisingly good too.
4,Supreme Skills,This anthology from one of the most talented bands I have had the pleasure to listen to is exactly that - a true pleasure. I am a big fan of Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits and his particular take on music is one that touches my soul. If I want to chill out after a long hard day I take a long dose of this album with my best headphones and my favourite chair and just kick back. It has to date not let me down once. Buy it and enjoy.
5,Knopfler Must-have,"Can't get enought knopfler; wish he would do more compilations with guitarists (like the late chet atkins, nottingham hillbillies, etc). Just can't get enough. One of the truely great guitarists out there today."
5,Knopfler and Dire Straits - great music,"Clever lyrics, great tunes, beautiful voices.Cheerful, sing-along-at-the-top-of-your-lungs music.Makes you feel young again music.Great quality recording from a group that should still be recording."
5,Fantastic listening!,"I love, love, love this CD and have it on whenever I'm in the car! So glad I found it and bought it. I've always enjoyed Knopfler's more obscure tunes and this is full of 'em It's one of those CD's that you can just put on and let it play. If you love Dire Straits and/or Mark Knopfler, this has all the classics!"
5,Simply spectacular,"Once again, Knopfler doesn't disappoint. Great guitar, opening song being ""Telegraph Road"" which for a music lover, it's ALL about music. Great riffs,loads of change, just terrific."
3,Best of Dire Straits & Mark Knopfler,"How they left off ""Solid Rock"" and ""Skate away"" is beyond me. They had all that 2nd disk and ""Calling Elvis"" is the only saving there!"
5,Great,"Classics from my youth, who could not enjoy listening to these guys...I love their music. Enjoy...I highly recommend the cd"
3,cheap down load.,The CD is a knockoff. It was down loaded and burnt onto a cheap disk. If I wanted to cheat the artist I could have down loaded the music. I will not purchase music CD's from Amazon in the future.
4,Give it a chance,"Some films require a level of trust in the filmmaker, with a solid payoff in the end. Straight Line is one of those films. I saw this at SXSW years ago, and wasn't sure I was going to like it, especially when I was initially distracted by the changes in film stock, but something told me to stick with it until the end, and it was well worth it.It's definitely an independent film, and not for those who have the film viewer version of ADD, but if you're someone willing to invest the time in a cinematic experience, especially independent film, check it out.If you like films like THE STATION AGENT, or BABEL, you'll likely enjoy STRAIGHT LINE."
4,Superb Film,"Though the acting may not be the best, No More Baths sends an excellent message in regards to peacefully protesting to make a change. It was a good story, perfect for teaching young kids about the turbulent 1960s and the changes that occurred."
2,"Slow, slow, slow... I gave up midway through this one!","Behind the Pine Curtain's plot moved at a snail's pace, which wouldn't have been so bad had the romantic tension been built up along the way. Unfortunately, not only was there no ""slow burn"", there were no discernible romantic sparks between the two protagonists (at least in the first half of the book). Gerri Hill did a nice job of fleshing out the deep friendship between the two and they certainly had a ton of chemistry; it just wasn't sexual chemistry (at least in my opinion). The secondary characters and the overall ""small-town"" feel of the book were also well-developed.I much preferred Gerri Hill's romantic suspense efforts, such asThe TargetandThe Killing Room. Unlike BTPC, they were fast-paced and the romantic attraction between the leads was undeniable... a simple and winning formula for romance novels."
3,not quite as good,"Reading this book after Hunter's Way was probably a mistake because Behind the Pine Curtain seemed so boring. Something that drove me crazy is the way the author repeats information over and over and over and over again. The narrator will explain an event, then instantly start a dialog between characters explaining the exact information. ""Blue eyes on blue"" and ""fifteen years later"" is written a million times. It gets annoying after a while and it's a waste of pages.If you end up running across this book for an excellent bargain, then give it a shot, (the storyline's good). It's definitely not worth purchasing at full price."
3,Entertaining but No Surprises,"Gerri Hill is a fine writer and ""Behind the Pine Curtain"" is a typical example of her work. If there's anything to be said for Hill, she knows how to write a romance that showcases the full depth of feeling one woman--one *person*--can feel for another, beyond the simple carnal attraction that frequently limits other authors' depictions of relationships.Nevertheless, I must confess to being a little disappointed. When I read a blurb, I expect it to be a teaser--an appetiser to whet my palate for the main-course. Unfortunately, the blurbs to Ms. Hill's books frequently *are* the books, simply summarised. If you've read the blurb, you've read the book, just with less detail. I confess, I want more book or less blurb :)."
5,Curtain Lifted!,"Pine Curtain is a must read! It is a great book and if you love Gerri Hill's writing as much as I do, you won't be disappointed! This book has a little of everything: Friendship, Love, secrets, and a little what goes around comes around! And sex...can't forget that! Jackie and Kay are such sweet characters and you just want everything to go their way! Kay's family are just good people...This book is one to keep and read again! I am glad it is in my collection!"
4,behind,Better reading than the last few... at least booze is not the central theme this time.. maybe she's hearing that all lesbians do not ingest bottles of liquor every day
4,Success could be a possibility,"Considering that pop-punk music has been on a steady decline in popularity since 2004, you just don't expect new bands to embrace the sound so whole heartedly. Stepping into 'this could be a possibility' is like traveling thru time, going all the way back to when NFG, allister and Blink were at the top of their game. While it's true that the 10 songs here go by much too fast for a full length, that shouldn't take away from the appeal. 'this could be a possibility' is worth every penny, even if it is only 28 minutes long. Fans of Drive Thru Records, Blink 182 and Green Day circa 2001 should get to know Valencia right away.'Hit the lights' on 'Cartel' and send 'Fall out Boy' to an 'All Time Low' on your playlist, cuz Valencia is taking back the genre with style!"
3,Theres Better Bands IN Killadelphia,"The headline says it all , trust me i know. They arent bad but there is just as good"
3,Leran to sew a shirt or blouse,"I felt this is a very complicated instuction. This item is not for a beginner which I am not, however I feel it could be done with much more user frinedly."
2,"interesting idea, weak execution","The plot of this novel is fairly original, and the beginning seemed really promising. Where it failed, was on the actual execution of the plot, and motivation of characters. The Blackbird is supposed to be this genius of evil, and sometimes he just comes through as a low-grade hoodlum. To me this is the problem with author's skills. The whole plot just seems unlikely. Things happen without explanation, and it is hard to believe how these people got from what they used to be to what they are. I'm being vague not to spoil it to those who have not read the book yet. Another problem is that this book did not give me the feel of the time period. You could easily modify a few details, and change the place and time. Is it a problem? Yes, at least to me. I expected the historical fiction, and found a generic, forgettable story."
4,Fascinating and Full Blooded,"Set in medieval France, this is one of the novels in which the characters are full blooded and eternal, faulted and fundamentally good. The characters that alternate in carrying the narrative are the main ones and surprisingly through their own eyes you get a pretty good picture of their own souls.I always felt that in older times, people had a different code of living and that it is not possible to subject the people who lived then to the standards that apply now - or are there any standards now at all? - and reading this book, I felt that it was not written with that mindset either. I love period pieces that stay true to them. And this is my read of any of Joanne Harris's work. Is it sufficient to say that I really enjoyed it a lot and am looking forward to read more?"
2,Not so encouraging,"There is no doubt Joanne Harris a genius and a great writer and the reason I typically enjoy her books is because the main character is usually a strong and passionate woman. I felt this story's main character is so oppressed and manipulated that I couldn't finish the book - it was tiring and not hopeful in any way. Most of Ms. Harris' books inspire me to live life more passionately, cook, garden, smell life and live it fully - this one was just depressing."
3,Unique writing style and plotline satsfies.....,"While I can't put ""Holy Fools"" in the same category as ""Chocolat"" or ""Five Quarters of the Orange"" (which is one of my favorites), I have to commend Ms. Harris's continued uniqueness in her prose and chosen topics. As far as historical fiction goes, this book is sure to satisfy. I particularly liked the themes running throughout the novel such as the hypocrisy of religious institution, revenge, true love, the scheming and battling of wits, maternal bonds, and the way secrets take on a life of their own. Definitely an interesting and recommended read."
4,"signs, symbols, saints, sinners","I enjoy reading Joanne Harris because her themes center upon the relationship between a gifted but misfit woman and a man with a certain je ne sais quoi mixed with an edge of danger. I also admire her books because, while they could be written according to a single formula, as so many authors so tiresomely do, hers are all remarkably different. Holy Fools is darker than some of Harris' earlier work, and her treatment of the psychology of group dynamics here is intriguing and realistic. I can often guess the outcome of books involving mysterious death, but there are so many holy fools in this story that it had me guessing to the end, brought about with the help of a miracle. Is it a genuine miracle? You must decide for yourself. I still haven't made up my mind."
1,What happened to Tradition?,"Why do these so-called ""Catholics"" want to satisfy the Jews and Protestants so much? Change the Stations of the Cross to agree with the Gospel instead of Tradition? Don't they know that Tradition existed before the Gospel? The Gospel came from Tradition. Changes, changes, and more changes! Since Vatican II there has been change after change after change. More evidence that the Vatican ceases to be Catholic but started a new religion with Vatican II. The true Catholics are in exile, treated differently, because we have kept the Faith and the Sacraments unchanged."
2,Poor short wave bands recepcion,"This is a small radio (5""x3""x1 1/4""), light (it requieres 2 AA batteries, not included), with good FM and AM reception, but very poor SW recepcion (I've tried to listen some SW station but till now that have been impossible). But that it is something to expect from a cheap radio like this.The plastic case it isn't very strong but the radio has a powerful speaker with good sound.The frecuency range is: AM 525-1700 KHz, FM 82-108 MHz, SW 5-8-21-8 MHz and TV 56-223 MHz. This radio comes in a plastic box with no manual and it's made in China."
5,Amazing!,"I grew up with this movie, and watched it often, just as I do today. It took me years to find this soundtrack, and I'm glad I never gave up. This is by far country at its best. I know EVERY word to EVERY song. It wasn't until I found this album that I saw Dolly's true talent. It's my most played album, hands down. If you like country, you have to like this album."
5,Rhinestone Soundtrack & movie,"As a huge Dolly and Stallone fan, I must say this is a great soundtrack and the movie was also great. I have both which I watch & listen to over and over. Dolly is a TRUE country artist. I didn't think Stallone did such a bad job. I enjoyed the movie as well as the soundtrack. If you are a Dolly or Stallone fan, you will like the soundtrack & movie. See Stallone as you never have before. A complete turn around from Rambo."
1,Nothing to read or see,"HiThis is the book you would be returning if you know anything at all about arms. I really dont want to elaborate on this. Dont buy it, its a complete waste of moneyfarook"
1,Um....,"I am in no way, shape or form a hater of any kind but I honestly believe that this author told all of his friends to write reviews for his book. Why? I read this book...well the first 20 pages and could not believe a grown man could write so poorly. My 8-year-old cousin could do a better job (no joke). I couldn't finish the book because after the first 20 pages I had no idea what was going on it might have well been written in arabic. My advice to the author take some grammar classes...my advice to readers...if you MUST read this book go to the library DO NOT waste your money."
5,Straight Grit...,"I really didn't know that New Jersey was this freaking hotttt!!! I guess I should open my mind more. This book was fast, and so realistic. 3 friends in search for that almighty dollar. I already told Al-Saadiq I hated the ending but this book is so true to life you can't deny.Du Drop, E, and Tony childhood friends who find themselves caught up in fast cars, money, women, murder, drugs.E a sheisty guy from the beginning played himself all the way through and he deserved his downfall he wasn't a real soldierDu Drop in his weakness for money he sold himself to the devil and lost his religion, a near death experience revived himTony the young school boy who took on the notorious alter ego of Nephew DANG.... he had me weak! (Angie said he would!) This young boy comes from the bench and rolls harder than his friends could've ever imagined. His thirst to enter college earned him a hustler's degree.READ THIS BOOK!!!!The author is real good peoples also"
4,Excellent,I enjoyed the book. I thought I was left hanging at the end but once you get through the three books it will answer all of your questions. The author did his thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,LOVED THIS BOOK,"I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE MY HAT OFF TO AL-SAADIQ BANKS,THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK. DU DROP, TONY, AND E WAS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL PAPER CHASERS AND SELLING DRUGS WAS THE ONLY WAY TO GET MONEY FAST. I LOVED THIS BOOK I READ IT IN ONE DAY I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN SO IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A GOOD STREET NOVEL ABOUT MONEY, DRUGS, AND DRAMA THEN PICK UP THIS BOOK YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED.I CANT WAIT TO HIS NEXT BOOK COMES OUT WHENEVER THAT WILL BE !!!."
5,"""Hotttest Book Out Right Now""","This book was so good and interesting. Every page was filled with suspense, action, and excitement. Most of all the book was REAL and I knew what was going on because I know people that been through the same thing. It felt like I was right there and I could picture every situation. I recommend this book to anyone who is ready to read about the Streetz. Al Saadiq Banks is the newest and most creative author out right now and If he keeps writing books like this hit I believe he will be around for a long time."
1,Allergic to ALOE!,"Was always a very loyal customer to Kotex for years. Who on Earth decided that adding aloe to sanitary pads was a good idea is beyond me. I don't think their development team realized how many women suffer from an aloe allergy. These new pads are TERRIBLE. They cause burning, rashes, and are super uncomfortable. Why couldn't they keep their old line as well? Kotex just lost another customer to a different brand. If only they would ask the paying customers what they want..."
3,"good product, but the back side could stick to the underwear","It is really thin and I love the cotton like surface...keeps dry all the time. But the back of the pads could be pretty sticky. Some pads(the sticky gel on the back) stick to my underwear and it would be hard to clean. but overall, these pads are much better than others."
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for a book with alphabetical filing rules. Instead, I got a little box full of practice materials that were confusing and very unnecessary. This product was new, in good shape, arrived on time, etc...it is just not what I expected or needed. I think the description could have been much more clear!"
4,such a simple little song,"I was the bass player on hey baby.we were a group called the rondels playing around ft worth tex. and bruce channel sat in with us from time to time.ronnie kelly was the ""ron"" and delbert mcclinton was the ""del'.hey baby was cut in a very short time and every one was supprised when it went to #1 on the charts.bruce and delbert went on tour in england where they met the beatles. the rest of the band made about $72.50, union scale at that time for studio work.its cool to to hear it on the radio after all these years.jimmie"
2,great at first...,Have had the unit for 2 years.. things keep cracking.. had the screw cap crack and it took over 3 months to get L'Equip to rectify.. first they sent out another piece that didn't work and proceeded to argue with me and tell me that it was my fault the piece wasn't screwing in.. I spent over $20.00 shipping screw caps back and forth and had to deal with attitude from them as well. Finally got the screw cap that works with my juicer with no admittance of a mistake on their part... I JUST started juicing again and now the blank strainer cracked. I am NOT looking forward to dealing with customer service once again. Try another brand with a more reliable customer service.
1,No replacement parts available in US,"I loved my juicer, a L'Equip Visor Model 509, until the day I accidentally put a peach pit in it. This immediately cracked the juicing screw, but did not damage the motor or any other parts. I thought, ""What a good machine. I'll just order a new part."" Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that no spare parts are available in the US, and the British supplier will not ship to this country. Since I believe that juicing is vital to my health, I am forced to buy a completely new one for lack of one part. Be sure I will buy one that has parts available in this country."
5,Nice enough to leave on the counter,"I have both the Champion Juicer and this L'Equip Juicer. I have to say for juicing carrots I prefer the Champion because its fast, yet it heats up my carrots causing a loss in nutrients; however, for wheatgrass and anything else this L'Equip Juicer is better for it masticates slowly which leaves all the vital nutrients. I love all the attachments for you can make ice-cream or sorbet from frozen fruits, nut butters, grind grains and make pastas from fresh dough. It is also attractive enough to leave out on the counter."
4,repackaged,"The photo paper is excellent in and of itself. However the shipper had previously sold this package, and it had been repackaged. It probably was returned because of damage because the box we received was damaged. Every sheet of photo paper is creased from being dropped on the corner. I would not trust this supplier. I have had no problems using the paper however because my image size includes a margin and once the image is matted and framed no one notices the wrinkled paper. If I were selling these images for thousands of dollars however, this would be completely unsuitable. Unfortunately, my images do not fetch over a thousand dollars (LOL). They are several hundred dollars, but not in the league with the greats. So this is okay for one time."
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"I searched all over the internet before making this purchase for more information about what the Museum Etching Photo Paper would be like, and could not find a very good description. I was hoping that it would be like printing onto a canvasy material, but the paper has almost no texture to it at all.It is very thick, sturdy, and it takes the ink well from my Canon Pixma Pro 9000 Mark II. As nice as the paper is, it is not what I was hoping for, and I wouldn't spend the money on it again."
5,Great speakers and vaule,The sound is actually better than some of the Bose speakers I've heard at a fraction of the cost. I spent 12 times as much for another set of surround speakers and the difference between that and this Harmon Kardon set is not huge. I highly recommend these speakers.
3,Great Speaker - Lousy Warranty Service,Purchased HKTS-18 system on July 30. One satellite speaker died on Sept 10. 10 day runaround from Harmon Kardon to get a replacement. Sent me to Amazon who sent me to Harmon Kardon who sent me to some out of state warranty service who sent me back to Harmon Kardon. This is insane.
3,"Great sound, speaker stands problematic","The speakers have great sound. The instructions are clear and simple. Wall mounting the speakers may work but I did not want that. The speaker stand mounts are proprietary so if you're planning to go that way you'll probably have to buy the Harmon Kardon stands and pay the stiff price. I understood that going in, but the problem was dealing w Harmon Kardon. I could not find the black stands thru any one else. What showed up had obviously been around the block a few times. They shipped silver stands in a box marked black stands. There was not parts inventory included so I have no way of knowing if the parts were all there and they were all loose so who knows. The return process is problematic and has taken weeks. They are impossible to get thru to on the phone and I could not get their web return system to work for me. Eventually email worked but weeks later I'm still waiting for the right stands."
1,Subwoofer dead just after warranty expired (one year),"Not reliable.Good when volume is kept low.Distortion with high volume.My subwoofer is dead just after warranty expired, one year. NOTE THAT > They give warranty for subwoofer ONLY FOR 1 YEAR BUT NOT 5 YEARS."
3,Ok but JBL's are better.,I bought these speakers and hooked them up to my onkyo tx- sr606( don't buy this receiver it sucks) and I must say the jbls I used to have sound better more crisp than these do. So I would say to anyone looking at this set of speakers get the jbls the sound much better.
4,My neighbors love this ground shacking theater system,Great sound for the price. I live in an apartment and it only took a few days for nieghbors to complain about noise. The sub-woofer shakes all my walls!! Great clear sound with the Onkyo SR805 reciever I hooked them up to.
5,Great sound,"I am not an audio expert by far so you can consider these comments as by an average listener even though I used to work in professional audio studios years ago. These speakers are the best I've ever owned for home. I probably wouldn't really know the difference between these and more expensive speakers that audiophiles may prefer but they came highly recommended by several online sources. Originally, I was going to get the HKTS-15 but decided I might prefer having the extra power these have. I believe they are essentially the same.As far as construction quality, after a couple weeks, my son managed to trip over one speaker wire and knock the speaker off a 3ft high table onto a carpeted floor. No dents or dings and the speaker doesn't seem to be worse off for it.If you are frustrated with the bewildering array of choices for your home system, and just want something that sounds like you bought a quality component, you won't be wrong choosing these or the -15 I mentioned above."
5,Simply awesome,"Just another 5 star review like you needed any more convincing. These speakers sound absolutely fantastic and look really good too. The subwoofer was bigger than I expected (based upon the photos) so check those dimensions. I wall mounted the speakers in the four corners of a 20' x 16' room and while the brackets are without doubt of poor design, they are sturdy and allow easy horizontal positioning once mounted. I ended up drilling a hole in the top of the speaker mount so that I could cleanly (and invisibly) run the wire from the crown molding down behind and into the speaker through the mount.Onkyo TX-SR705 7.1 Channel Home Theater Receiver"
5,Step a side Bose,"Making this choice was not easy for me. After months of listening and cranking up systems at various stores (yes, that's me trying to blow the speakers, I love it when the salesmen comes over and is trying to say something but you can't hear him. I like to give them that Blueman Group stare),I found what I was looking for. A sexy looking system, crisp sound, room thundering lows and easy on the pocket. While I was considering a Bose system the price kept turning me off--sounds great, price sucks. The HKTS-18 offers a great sounding system at a realistic price. Thanks to Bose's pricing, it kept me in the game a little longer. Long enough to find this gem from Harman Kardon. Very satisfied. Plus shipping from Amazon was amazing. Received the speakers in two days on standard shipping. Nice surprise."
3,HKTS 18 Nice Construction Poor Center Channel,"The HKTS 18 is a beautiful shinny black speaker system all nicely matching. Each piece is heavy for its size and can deliver quite a sound. However, the Center Speaker is small, and though its sound quality might be deemed amazing compared to its size, the overall experience of owning it leaves me with the feeling that I'm lacking depth of sound. In my opinion, if you wish to buy this system, consider replacing the Center channel with a larger unit that could draw you into the orchestra. The satellites and subwoofer are good."
1,"Sub-par subwoofer, even for quiet types","I'm one of those rare, conscientious apartment dwellers who never turns his music up past 3. When I first received this set as a gift, I was very stingy with the bass. After a few months I turned it up just a hair, but never high enough to bother my downstairs neighbor or even wake my spouse. You can imagine my surprise when, just over a year after receiving it, the subwoofer just stopped working. Lights up, turns on, but no sound.A friend suggested I replace the fuse. Guess what? You can't find this in any store, online or brick-and-mortar. Harman Kardon is the only one in the US who has it. That would be only slightly annoying if it wasn't sold out whenever I call to order one. Each time I'm told they will be in stock in two weeks. I wait two weeks, call, and get told ""two weeks"". And forget about taking it in for repairs. That will cost you about what you paid for the whole shebang. Avoid at all costs."
5,incredible speakers,"I've really enjoyed these speakers in my home theater system. They look and sound fantastic. I live in an apartment so I keep the subwoofer down. However, on the rare occasion that I have turned it up, it shakes the entire complex. I've had these speakers for five years and will continue to enjoy them for many more."
2,cheap,"Pretty cheap feeling headphones but worth it for the money if they work for your phone, since they're 2.5mm. However they did not work with my palm centro. And it wasn't worth the 4 or 5 bucks to send them back, so that was a waste."
2,don't like it,"two other people said they like this product. i agree, the sound is immensely better with two ear-pieces, but one is shorter (a LOT shorter) than the other, and it looks as though it is not adjustable. I have tried and can't do it. so i have a ton of wire hanging on one side, and the other can barely reach my ear. i also just don't like all that wire, which gets tangled the second you take it out of your ear."
4,Not what I ordered but still a good product,"I purchased these earphones for my blackberry pearl which requires a 2.5mm sized plug. This did NOT fit my blackberry. The product I received was 3.5mm. However, I still kept the earphones because they play beautifully on my computer. But now I have to order an adapter that can connect these earphones to my blackberry. So if you're buying this product for a Blackberry Pearl then these won't fit. But if you just want good earphones to go for your laptop or desktop then this is a very good product."
3,Falling Apart,"Don't get me wrong, the sound on these earphones is great, and works perfectly. However, the ear pieces are falling apart. It's hard to explain but the black plastic piece that surrounds it just fell off and it sounds like there are loose pieces rattling inside. Now I can't keep it in my ear. Maybe I just got a bad one..but it was disappointing."
2,Underpowered and uncompetitive,"There are three or four really great recordings of Walton's first and this version doesn't come off well in any comparison. The best is Previn's RCA recording with the LSO and no other attempt before or since has captured the seething tension of the 1st mov., the ferocity of the 2nd., repose and exaltation of the 3rd. & 4th. anything like as vividly. At least in Britain the Previn RCA version is available almost as cheaply as the Naxos, which therefore has no price advantage. Other versions it is also well worth having is the first ever under Hamilton Harty (originally released as 3 movements before the finale was composed) and the excellent Malcolm Sargent EMI version. The old Adrian Boult and more recent Leonard Slatkin versions are also very good."
3,"So, so...","I thought this book was okay, but I it was based WAY too much on Jessica and Elizabeth's problem. I think that something should happen with Damon, Lacey, Kirstin, and Salvador soon."
3,"Good, But...","This book was good, but I think that Elizabeth and Jessica's fight was kind of stupid, and the way their friends were so affected by it was kind of overdoing it, too. The book was pretty much about everyone being miserble the whole time because of Elizabeth and Jessica's meaningless fight.Like I said, it was good, but I still give it 3 stars because it wasn't as good as the others. The ending was also kind of sappy, but is also a happy ending. If you like school drama kinds of books, then you'll love this series."
5,Best Bottles Ever!,"When I was pregnant there were sooo many articles out about BPA and babies getting serious complications from all those chemicals in plastic bottles. The green bottles were very cute, but rather expensive. I decided to go a little old school with these glass bottles and boy am I glad that I did. My baby loves them. They are easy clean and the nipples and bottle tops are great quality. The only thing is that you have to make sure you burp your baby well after feeding because with glass bottles without any liner they are more likely to have gas. These are great and I will only use them for our babies who have yet to come!"
5,Evenflo baby bottles,"A friend of mine could not find glass baby bottles. I went on line and found the old fashioned EvenFlo glass bottles. Needlesss to say, my friend was extremely happy with my find. She just was not pleased with the plastic bottles for sanitary reasons. Thanks."
2,My son does not like the npple,My son refuses to drink from this bottle. I like the idea of glass. I just which it came with a softer nipple.
4,Mike Is One of the Coolest,"I probably listen to Soul Coughing at least once a day, maybe twice. Mike's solo stuff has felt a little lacking, but it isn't bad. I mostly don't like it because I discovered Soul Coughing first.Anyway, I said that to say this: ""Slanky"" is a great book.Whether you're a Soul Coughing fan or a Mike Doughty fan; hell, even both, you will like this book. It's filled to the brim with abstract and beautiful insights from Mike's point of view of the world, along with some rhythmic poems that sort of feel like a song when reading them. There are even some short (SHORT) stories.Definitely worth more than one read, ""Slanky"" is a book to own if you're a fan of Mike's music or just someone looking for some excellent poetry."
3,The music is better,"I miss his rhythmic delivery aided greatly by the band Soul Coughing. His choice of vocabulary is keen and unerring within lyrics but uninspired in poems. Buy the music, skip the book."
5,Great board,"I have several of these cutting boards, (in two sizes) and they are the greatest for slicing and dicing. They are non-skid, usable on both sides, easy to clean and dishwasher safe. I have fancy wooden cutting boards, which I use for carving at the table, etc. But these poly boards are what I use every day. Highly recommend."
1,The cutting surface is terrible!,"Using this board is like trying to cut food on top of something that has been oiled. It even feels like it leaves oil on your fingers when you touch it. A good cutting board will be slightly dulled and will somewhat grip food so that it doesn't slide while cutting. The food slides all over this board. It's almost like cutting on glass but not quite as hard. And I hope that EVERYONE knows not to cut on glass!My daughter who is a professional chef can't stand to cut on this board. This board is a hard slippery piece of plastic, and I wonder if it doesn't dull the knives as well. I bought this for my Mother who needed a cutting board, (not for myself) and my daughter and I are both forced to use it when we visit my Mom. It really takes the fun out of chopping and I think it was a total waste of money. As far as keeping any chopping board from slipping, simply put a damp kitchen towel between the counter and the board, and it will go no where."
2,Disappointed,"I choose this board because of the size and the juice groove. Unfortunately, the groove is very shallow and most of my roasts over-run the channel. I have had it for about a year and used it 3 times. As soon as I remember to drag it out from behind the sink, it will go in the garbage."
4,NICE BOARD,good cutting board for the money no problem so far after only about a month but i have used it and ran it through the dishwasher.
5,Best Plastic Cutting Board Ever?,"This cutting board is the best plastic cutting board I've ever owned. OXO really thought this one out. It has a nice color coded rubber rim (we bought both the red and black) to help prevent cross contamination. It has a little trough to catch juices from the various things you're cutting. This also helps you figure out which way is up to make cleaning easier. And finally, my favorite feature, it has four little legs on each side that keep it elevated off the counter top. This to me is really cool, it prevents the funk on the countertop from migrating on to the cutting board, really cool."
2,ok. but made in china,"Hey there! I just got these boards and I then I disappointingly saw the label ""Made in China"". Thought of buying stuff made in the US. That is why I will ship it back. Will see, if I can find an appropriate board made in the US (any hints are welcome! :) ). Otherwise I will buy a W√ºsthof one again."
3,Decent Cutting Board,"This board is decent and usable. It slides around a lot on my metallic countertop and needs to be placed on top of a towel to prevent sliding. It also can get scratched up pretty well by sharp knives. At this price though, its worth it even though I'll have to replace it within a year."
4,Nice construction a bit too small to cut a head of lettuce with...,"Doesn't slip, nice design and construction. However, I should I have opted for the larger version as it's hard to cut a head of lettuce on this board without pieces falling off."
1,Not bad but...,"Just another cutting board but you should know that the color is not white and whatever it really is defined as, it is not identified here.You should also note that this is a cutting board and not a trivet. It is not heat resistant. If you keep your cutting board out like me, you'll learn this the hard way. It melts. Unfortunately, this piece of safety information escapes the description and it therefore, becomes a nuisance piece of clutter, as oppose to something one can safely keep out and about."
2,Slippery surface,"I am big fan of Oxo products, but this one is not working for me. The size of the board is good, but the surface is slick and I find that when I am chopping vegetables, especially ones I have just washed, they move around on the board. There is no grippiness to the board, it is smooth. I would prefer a board with more traction."
2,Not level,"Ive purchased this same board from stores, and always loved it. But this one came uneven. It bows up, meaning it won't stay flat, and constantly spins when I try to cut on it. I can flip it and use the other side...but then I dont get the benefit of the recessed lip to catch juice."
3,Should hold up better,As a cutting board it isn't holding up very well. I have had this for about 3 months now and there are a lot of deep scratches and cuts in the main board. I do use it every day with some fairly sharp knives so maybe I'm being picky but I would think the material shouldn't scratch up that easily. It cleans up easily and being able to put it into the dishwasher after cutting up some chicken is great. And the fact that the rubber feet keep this from sliding aroung on a granite countertop is a real plus.
3,It's a decent utility board.,"It cleans very easily, stays put while cutting, seems to leave pretty deep cut marks but we've only had it about a month. We bought based on a recommend from Cooks Country who don't get paid to recommend kitchen products. (I think.) Good purchase for the price, though."
5,Awesome cutting board!,Awesome cutting board! These things have been great so far. Not warped or stained or cut up. Highly Recommended. I would purchase again.
4,the bumbastic board,"good board, it works well, i purchased a set at Samsclup and it came w/ a glass board sucked. I went ahead and returned and made my purchases through Amazon, great to have these reviews. It has little rubbers that hold it in place well. I like the way it feels, kinda like what they have at butcher shops. I like the edge rubberised style. It cleans easy and it's light weight. which is great"
5,Quality non-skid cutting board,This is a quality non-skid cutting board that met all my expectations:It fits into my dishwasher for easy cleanupIt has a groove to prevent spillage onto my countertopsIt's non-skidIt's large enough to cut just about anythingThe price is very affordableIt doesn't dull my knivesIt doesn't harbor bacteriaOverall I am very pleased with this cutting board and would definately buy it again if I needed to.
3,You get what you pay for,"While it's not the greatest cutting board in the world, the Oxo Good Grips does what it's supposed to do and it does it pretty well. The silicone feet hold the board in place well enough, even when the counter is wet, and they make the board easier to lift off the counter to put away.My only complaint is that the plastic seems a little softer than some other higher quality cutting boards. After a few months of use my board already has a few thin strips of plastic coming out from where I've cut on it repeatedly. Just be aware that these bits of plastic aren't getting mixed in with your food."
3,Not worth the price.,The house is made of 1/4 inch wood. At this price I would expect much heavier materials.
5,"The only guide to Kyrgyz history, culture and society.","This dictionary is the most useful resourse to date that proves to be a quick and thoughtfull guide for twentieth century Kyrgyz history and society. It provides the students of Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia with a concise chronology and a comprehensive list of key issues and concepts. The book demonstrates that Rafis Abazov has done a great deal of research on this neglected region. In addition to being a resource for the history of the region, the dictionary teaches the reader about cultural, social, political and economic facts about Kyrgzystan.I highly recommend this dictionary as an extensive and well-written reference book of Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia. It would make an excellent reference book for libraries, schools and universities."
5,4 years later !!!,"This was the best notebook I ever owned. Just gave to my daughter for Fall 2008 semester at college. I would still take it over a new laptop with Vista for an OS. We did learn that dropping it off a table with the screen open can break the glass inside the screen and mess it up for using the laptop screen.I just found a factory replacement screen for $69.99 on the internet and 40 minutes later good as new again. Yes there is better equipment out there and my alternative was a black MacBook to avoid buying Vista. The R3240US is now pretty cheap in the used markets, and given the ease they can be taken apart and repaired I may buy a couple of the used ones and have a good back-up with Win XP as well as a supply of parts. It really has lasted well other than the 3 foot drop test my kiddo subjected it to. No other problems with hardware and as for Windows, what can I say there!"
3,"Good performance, poor quality, mediocre value","When you first get a Compaq R3000 series computer, you love it. The price-performance looks great. The AMD processor performs well. 512 MB of DDR RAM is great. The 60 GB hard drive is large enough for most users. My favorite feature is the push button to disable the glide pad.After 1 year, you realize the quality is poor. Plastic parts begin to break and fall off. My eject buttons for the PCMCIA slots fell off, and I have never used them. The computer overheats and locks up often. The DVD drive door often opens by itself. The CD writer has never worked. After going through the technical support website, I discovered that the inability to write CDs was a known bug. After one year, there is still no fix."
5,This book rocks,"I'm a freshman at my school and my best friend and I are trying out for our school play. We needed to do a monologue, so my friends mom bought The ultimate audition book for Teens 3. We read all the girls' monologues together. Even her mom read them. We had so much fun reading them to one another, and her mom said that she felt exactly the same way that the characters did- - - We felt like Kristen Dabrowski must also go to our school, so many of the characters were just like us only funnier. I would recommend this books to every teen who loves theatre, but hope that nobody from my school finds out about it until after my audition."
5,Delicate Delight.,"Fernando Sor was Spanish, exciled to Paris for having too much affiliation with the Bonaparte regime. He wrote many compositions for the guitar, and duets, the 2nd volumeof which is heard here. The stucture and phrasing of this music is simply wonderful, and very easy to listen to- for the beginner or the experienced audiophile.The guitar playing and the sound recording are both tops- this is indeed a CD to treasure."
5,Exploring the Epistles of Peter (John Phillips Commentary Series),This book has really good thoughts and explanations on the scriptures. It gives insight that is great for studying and forteaching the New Testament books of 1 & 2 Peter.
4,C.P.E. Bach: Hamburg Sinfonias Nos. 1-6,C.P.E. Bach: Hamburg Sinfonias Nos. 1-6 is a recording by Naxos under the direction of Christian Benda and played by Capella Istropolitana. In the booklet we also get well-written linernotes by Allan Badley as well as short biographies of Christian Benda as well as Capella Istropolitana. CPE Bach's sound is very similair to that of both Haydn and Mozart and Mozart was influenced by CPE Bach. 5/5.
4,"Easy to read, and with unusual insights","Years of experience as a teacher of art appreciation, and as an artist herself, Betty has a firm grasp on the essentials of teaching the art of painting to the completely unschooled. Great examples for teachers and educators, and offers new insights into actual artworks.Nicely put together as a book as well, has a hand-made limited edition feel. (which it probably is) Too bad it's out of print, it's a great little book."
5,"A Mighty Mouse (No, Not That One!)","I have alot of Folkmanis puppets and they range in quality but this one is perfect. It feels wonderful even on a grown man's hand (a plus when doing puppet ministry at church), and it is just quality craftsmanship and attention to detail from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail. A snuggly, velvety fabric ""fur"" & fuzzy ears finish the expressive effect. There are several videos on YouTube demonstrating him in action (including mine) where you can judge for yourself."
5,Ten Stars!,"My 8-month old daughter just inherited this from her big brother and she can not get enough of it! Mouse plays peek-a-boo, gives hugs and kisses, nibbles her fingers, plays tug-o-war with it's long tail, and she just laughs and laughs. It is without a doubt her favorite toy so far and the quality is so great (Mouse is on his second tour of duty in the play pen)we've added other Folkmanis puppets to her Christmas wish list."
5,I'm gonna get one!,"My old simple bench grinder broke and so I need to buy a new one. Diving into the woodworking library I keep in my basement, I found two comparison articles. (1) April '99 Fine WoodWorking, and (2) Feb '95 WOOD. Both love the Tormek 2004. FW says: ""When you buy one of these machines, you're not buying just a grinder but a whhole system -- and a well-thought-out one. ....Most beginners love this machine because it produces results that are controlled and predictable. WOOD says: ""We chose the TORMEK as the sharpening machine we'd most like to see in our shop.""""Our favorite. Does everything from fast material removing to final polishing. Numerous jigs."" Well, that's good enough for me."
5,Perfection in sharpening,"This is the best sharpening system available anywhere at any price. It is expensive, but all of the best tools are. The book that comes with the machine looks a bit intimidating at first for a tool with one switch, two wheels, and a guide bar. However, the book is broken down into the separate jigs & attachments. Just match up the jig with the section of the book and all you have to do is read a few pages to get a perfect edge. I do a fair amount of wood turning and I cannot sharpen tools with a stone to save my life. Within 30 minutes of getting this thing home and out of the box, I had a perfect edge on my skew chisel. I even put a curved edge on it to keep it from digging in. I was never even able to put a decent straight edge on it before. No mess, no sparks, no blue edged tools, just sharp tools that cut better than when they were new. I hated paying for it, but there is no equal."
5,"not perfect, but the best","I use this sharpening tool primarily for chisels. I first learned to use the tormek when in undergrad at RISD after learning to hand sharpen chisels on a wet stone. It was valuable to learn how to hand sharpen a chisel, but even more exciting to appreciate what an incredible tool the tormek is! If you are looking to get the sharpest possible edge with the great benefit of using a chisel with a hollow grind, look no further, its worth every penny. I suppose the complaints in the rest of the comments are completely valid, but show me a grinder that addresses these problems while being as accurate and well made as the tormek and I will reduce my ratings to 4 stars."
1,? ? ?,I got to about page 28 before I chucked this. It reminded me strongly of Vance (on his off-days).From what I have read I cannot tell if Lord Drev is the Hero or the Villain. He certainly is unlikable enough to be the Archvillain in any book.
5,"Adam Lee's ""The Dark Shore"" Is Simply Fasinating","""The Dark Shore"", Adam Lee's debut novel, is is simply fasinating. Mr. Lee does an excellent job of creating a puzzle that at first glance seems insolvable, but in the end Mr. Lee puts the pieces together wonderfully. Mr. Lee also uses magnificent description making the reader feel as if he is actually part of the story. For any one who likes Fantasy, this is a book for you."
3,does it work?,"i didn't even notice much of a difference, but i was using mrs. allen's shed stop, a deshedding shampoo, a deshedding brush, AND this spray- so i'm not sure which worked or maybe ALL worked, but the shedding is DEFINITELY improved."
3,Not perfect but it works well enough...,"As other reviewers have noted, the power cord is too short, it needs to be about 5 feet longer. And the motion sensor shuts off too quickly. Ideally, it would stay on much longer when on AC power and only shut down quickly when on battery power.I have a single garage door, double wide for two cars. To mount the laser for two cars that are pulled in head first, I had to place the unit at an angle relative to the center of the garage (so it was over the hood of one car). Then the laser for the other car was at a severe angle when it hits the car but within the adjustment range of the lasers and the plastic housing.Overall, it is an ok unit with room for improvement.This unit replaces an older Instapark laser that used a small solar panel for power. I'd have gotten another unit based on a solar panel if they were still available..."
4,Very pleased with laser parking system,I purchased this on Amazon after seeing in Skymall catalog. Price was half of the Skymall price and did exactly what I had hoped. It allows me to park the cars where I need to ensure door closes and I can open fridge door. As others mentioned the AC cord is a little short for some applications. I had to use an extension cord to reach ceiling outlet but that was only a minor issue. The laser heads are somewhat limited on the range however I had no issue aiming them at our cars. Our garage is large and has two doors for those who say the range was limited.This is the best method I have found to assist in parking. Very happy with product. After installing in our garage I have bought two more sets as gifts. Bought for in-laws and parents and both love the parking system.
1,Not what I hoped for.,The cord is too short to be able reach from the outlet for the opener . I added about three feet and now the strength is very weak.
2,Limited and Cheaply Made,"The unit functioned when I took it out of the box but upon trying to get the lasers to point properly a wire inside broke. Upon examination it was clear that the design did not protect the wires from the bending and rotating allowed by the lasrs. The gage wire that was used is so thin it breaks very easily. It was broken in one place and the other wire was already set to break showing open copper to two other places. In addition, the motion sensor is fairly limited making placement difficult. The laswers also are not allowed to rotate enough to properly place the unit. They rotate backward better than forward."
2,Poor range of motion,"The product is unable to reach both cars despite having a tall ceiling. In all, the laser itself works well but its range of motion to the sides is very, very limited."
2,Works sometimes,"I previously had an older version of this unit and it worked fine for about three years until the power supply went out. I used it for a while with batteries only but the batteries only last about a week.I ordered the newer version and right out of the box it worked great except that the laser pointers did not have enough range of motion. Even though I have a 12 foot ceiling in my garage, I could not aim the pointers at both cars. I was able to modify the laser pointers by cutting away the plastic around the base of the laser pointers with a Dremel tool. Now I have had the item for about ten days and the motion detector is not working very well. Half the time I drive into the garage the lasers do not go on. I have to back out and try it again and hope to activate the lasers.This is quite a simple item, makes me wonder why they cannot spend another $2 or $3 in manufacturing and make one that works dependably."
3,Instapark Dual Garage Door Laser Parking Guide System,Product did not function completly as design. Only one of the laser lights worked.Since I only have one car it will get the job done. No sense in spending more moneyon postage. Last one I used was singular and lasted over four years.
1,Do Not Buy,"DO NOT BUY this product. the sensor has a range of 6 inches! That's right 6 inches, not even 6 feet. completely worthless."
2,Needs some engineering,"I purchased this insatpark to replace the one I had made my Genie that is no longer available. One of the lasers failed. This unit works fine except you cannot adjust the lasers wide enough to work with two cars. This could easily be fixed with a little engineering. As it turned out, I kept the Genie system for one car and used the insatpark for the other car. This is the only reason for the two star rating. If it were not for this problem, I would g ive it a 5 star rating."
2,Bad Aim,The twin lasers do not go to the side far enough to hit the area where the driver is seated to be seen properly. Needs modification to product.
2,They Got It Half Right,"Only one of the two laser beams of the Instapark Dual Garage Door Laser Parking Guide worked. Recycled switch and checked connection to no avail. Will leave unit in place for use on one side of garage. Not worth the hassle for refund as would invoke recovery of Amazon Free Super Saver Shipping cost, and exchange for identical working unit was not a menu option due to vendor is an Amazon partner as opposed to direct from Amazon. Was a major dissappointment overall, although the side that is operable is an effective parking guide."
1,"No good, no work, no ...","simply disappointed as system worked for about 6 days or so.rip off, waste of time and money. How about a little action?"
3,Instapark Dual Garage Parking System,This product is just OK. The wiring that came with it isn't very long and if you don't have a outlet close at hand then you will need to run an extension cord or install an electrical outlet.
1,Total piece of junk,This thing is a total piece of junk. One laser was way out of focus. Attempted to fix it but all the cheap wiring made it impossible. Ended up tossing it in the trash rather than wasting more time shipping the thing back. Don't waste your hard earned $.
1,Junk,"Well, what more can I say. This Instapark Dual Garage Door Laser Parking Guide is built very cheaply and fell apart before I could even get it installed. Don't waste your money on it. I recommend the old tennis ball on a string. At least if it breaks, it is cheap and easy to replace."
1,"Limited swivel, stopped working after 3 months","I'm very dissapointed in the product. First of all, the range of motion of the swivel is very very limited. After 3 months, one of the lasers crapped out, so only one lights up... Into the trash because the time to return has expired... Picked up one from Sears, and it is much better."
1,Pretty slick while it worked,"Install was easy, and I didn't have a problem with it detecting the cars. One of the lasers only worked for 2 days. Not sure if I am going to re-order."
3,Arcosanti Archetype is a very good read,"Arcosanti Archetype accomplishes what the author, Marie Wilson, set out to do. That is, provoke thought in people about issues related to urban sprawl. The book features the ideology of Paolo Soleri who has dedicated his life to environmental issues through his innovative project located between Phoenix and the Grand Canyon. Wilson has depicted the project and people through colorful photographs and interviews including quotes from Soleri. Even if you have not visited Arcosanti, you will find that this reasonably priced book is a worthwhile read with facts about the world population, quotes from Aldo Leopold's, A Sand County Almanac, and thoughts from philosopher Teilhard de Chardin on happiness and ""our task to turn the physical universe into a divine universe"". A great book to give students or teachers interested in architecture and lifestyles."
1,arcosanti archetype,"Don't bother with this book. It is not well written or well presented, and there are no good photographs either. I can't beleive I paid so much money for it. If you want a serious book about Arcosanti get the Soleri: Architecture as Human Ecology book published by the Monacelli Press."
3,Not your usual kind of movie,"The movie, ""Medea"" with Maria Callas as the title role, is a strange, even bizarre, take on the legend. Callas is beautifully photographed when she is present. She doesn't even appear until a lot of odd things go on featuring barbarian ritual practices. She is finally shown, just standing there, observing. I found the story hard to follow - what was in her mind, and what actually happened. It was edited badly I thought. I am a movie fan, and a Callas admirer, but this certainly was not in a league with her operatic performances, due to what I would deem bad directing. I'm glad that I finally saw the movie, but can understand why it never did very well."
5,Euripides under Pasolini ' s approach!,"The classic Greek tragedy in hands of Pier Paolo acquires a revaluated vision according to this talented image' s poet .The simple fact to consider to Maria Callas one of the Goddess of the Opera performing Medea confirms Wagner' s thesis about the arts ` integration .And since the stated situations may be not perfectly in consonance respect the original script , if you are an open mind viewer , you just . Forget about the rules of the tradition .The art has never been a definitive statement by itself . The transformation is involved through its grow up process . In this sense transformation and innovation may be well considered equivalent concepts .Acquire this artwork and get on the line with the cathartic experience."
4,Medea,My copy repeats the scene where Medea gives Jason gifts to present to Glauce and then shows two differeent endings for Glauce. It did not include the Tony Palmer documentary on Callas. This seemed a bit strange since the official release for this DVD is 6 December.
4,A footnote to the other reviews,"Am I the only one to notice that the killing of the Princess and her father is shown twice in the DVD version? (Is it in the tape edition also?) We see them burst into flame, then we go back to Medea planning the murder, and then we see it again! I wrote to the distributor and he said he forwarded my comments to the producers. I never heard a word from the latter. So I am posting this to ask if any one else has noticed this strange duplication. I would very much appreciate hearing from any body whose copy has the same flaw or does not."
1,A Humiliation,"How could anyone cast the greatest diva of the 20th century in this disgrace? No wonder La Divina never made another picture. Compared to ""Revenge of the Zombies"" or ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" this one is a step down. Understandably, Callas never made another motion picture. Who could have faced a camera after this catastrophe? See it only to know how beautiful Callas was--and how deeply she was humiliated after her career had ended. Sad, sad."
4,"Well, it could have been worse","Pasolini fans have been struggling with low-quality DVD's since the advent of the format, and Medea is no exception. This disc, put out by Vanguard, is certainly a step above the Wellspring and Image Pasolini DVD's, but that really isn't saying much. The transfer is fairly dirty and washed-out, and the sound is very hissy. The punctuation in the subtitles is abominable. That being said, they are actually quite easy to read.The film itself is good, although it doesn't reach the heights of Pasolini's earlier Oedipus Rex. The film is very slow, lacking a great deal of dialogue, until it explodes at the very end. It's a little convaluted, and I highly advise reading a summary of the story before delving into the film.While Medea isn't Pasolini's best film, it's certainly not his worst DVD. Worth a rental, at least."
3,An Evening with Heaney,"Nobel Prize winner Seamus Heaney's latest collection ""District and Circle"" takes us into a multitude of worlds. The finest poems seem to be in the front and in the back. In these poems he chants lyrically about Irish farming practices to miniature homages to other poets, such as Rilke and Neruda. In the first poem, the reader can actually hear the grunt of the laborer as he struggles with his tools and we are given the sensation in real time. From a boyhood in the Second World War to what seems an odd morning in the life a mature poet, we feel the impressionist candor of Heaney's writing. I found this collection enjoyable, but there are a few forgettable poems, and a few that seem irrelevant, but it may be that I missed the nuances. Overall, it is worth reading, but do not make it your only foray into Heaney's poetry for, admittedly, it had been mine."
4,This camera is perfect for what it's designed to do,"The fact that this records files with an .mod suffix is irrelevant. When you rename them as .mpg files they are fine. Actually, Premiere Elements 2.0 doesn't even require you to rename them, it deals with .mod files just fine.The video is very good, with just a bit of jagged lines when there's fast motion.The point is, this camera is meant to be an easy thing to put in your pocket so you are always ready to grab some video and it does this superbly.It's not quite as good video as a higher end DV camera, but it's not meant for that. It's a great addition to your camera collection."
3,Not Recommended,"I own this this camera since February 2004. It is very well built, light and handy, fits in any pocket.Video quality with light is very good. In low light conditions is very bad or no video at all.It is complicated to manage the files. Panasonic uses a trick to edit the video files. Files extenssion is .MOD, it is not .MPG. The change of extenssion was done to allow the edition of the recorded files with included Panasonic software and you will not find another compatibility for edition.If you backup the files in CD's or DVD's you will need to replace the extension of the files to play it in your DVD Player except for Panasonic DVD players.Example: File name MOV01.MOD must be changed to MOV01.MPG.You may want to use VLC software in your computer instead of Panasonic software included.From my point of view this product is not completely developed yet."
1,What were they thinking?,"Here's a nice piece of hardware that was sabotaged by Panasonic's software division. It's hard to believe that,in this era of video file type proliferation, Panasonic could have produced MPEG2 files that are incompatable with practically all video editing software on the market. Panasonic provides a conversion and editing program called ""MediaStage"". It's practically worthless. It's simultaneously elementary and obscure. If you are comfortable with MS Windows and then open MediaStage to run the program, you'll be stunned at how disconnected software developers can be with users. The only conversion available for MPEG2 files (in .MOD and .MOI format, no less) is to MPEG4 or to WMV. What a pity.Maybe one of these days some software developer will produce some decent software that can edit these strange d-snap files.I asked Panasonic, but they couldn't recommend any software to me. The joke's on me."
2,Don't buy it,"The camera would be as advertised if it was not for the MPEG2 file fomat and they use and lack of software control over your files. Sure you can copy and rename the files off the SD card, but don't save them to your computer first using the supplied software, it uses some compression method to create one huge file from all your little ones. And they will be little, 10 minutes record time in high quality for $900.00 + cost of 512 MB SD card, please.Lastly you cannot edit the panasonic MPEG2 formats like others using Adobe or Ulead, you can burn them straight to DVD but splitting tracks, adding effects, and doing the things that make a video look slick don't work well if at all. Many players don't have the codec available to play back the files either!Check the net for more info, plenty of angry folks on the camcorder forums discussing the workarounds for panasonics mistakes and misleading product info."
4,Size & lite weight are its strong points.,"This is a great little camcorder for having with you at all times to take short videos. You will have to download often to your computer since the SD card cannot hold much. These .MOD files for MPEG2 take up a lot of room. Most people don't like to watch long videos anyway. You will have this camcorder with you when the bigger one will be at home or in the car. The supplied software is not worth a dime. It cannot keep up with your files if you need to move them. Get Moonlight El-ecard MPEG2 Player software from the Internet. You can also transfer the videos to VHS, 8mm or DV tape. Actually, they look better doing this (then watching on your TV) than by viewing them on your computer."
3,sv-av100,"The advantage is that it is small and light, even smaller andlighter than my cannon power shot camera. The biggst problem isbattery life, it claimed that it would be capable shoot about60 minutes continuously, but in my experience, the battery isgone before I finish all 20 minutes SD capacity (in Mpeg2 normalmode)."
5,The art work is fabulous!,My nephew loves this book. The colorful and creative illustrations are wonderful. And learning how to slide the windows all by himself has been a confidence booster. This book makes the alphabet a blast to learn!
1,Hated it,I just hated the Baby Bjorn. It was so hard to figure out all those buckles and I didn't like how my baby's legs just hung down. It looked awfully uncomfortable. We were both happier with a plain old fabric sling. You can also nurse in a sling and it's more comfortable for the baby to sleep.
5,Great discussion of media coverage during the Gulf War.,"This book is an important contribution to the clearer comprehension of media coverage of a major US foreign intervention. Douglas Kellner has unearthed some rather ugly truths that make democracy and freedom of the press appear mere illusions. Kellner analyzes ""official"" media presentations and compares them to more reliable sources, producing a nuanced treatment of US imperialism in the Persian Gulf. An excellent source for critical perspective and analysis, Kellner consistently poses the important questions pressing politicians and policy-makers for answers.Kellner leaves the reader to continue questioning fundamental issues regarding foreign policy and how our blind acceptance of the professed goals further the power of our interventionist state. I highly recommend any of Douglas Kellner's books."
4,Recommended - especially timely with Iraqi War,"I found this book on my girlfriend's bookshelf (she had it for a class at UT while in undergrad), and I really enjoyed it and have recommended it to many people. Kellner brings a lot of interesting footage from the first Persian Gulf War to light and puts it in historical context. I read it before the start of the war in Iraq, and felt much more educated and objective when watching the countless hours of footage from all the major news networks. Kellner accurately questions the objectivity of our news sources, news anchors, and the media conglomerates that own them. Any person serious about perserving a democracy in which the public is accurately informed should give it a read."
4,"Sweet, quick read","I enjoyed this book as a light, summer read. I also read Durable Goods, but must confess that I don't remember it. This book is definitely about a 13 year old. Some people might find that interesting, others won't. I'm sort of in the middle. The ""coming of age"" thing is not exactly earth shattering - nor is this story. But it is sweet."
3,Not quite as good as the others,I am a big fan of Elizabeth Berg and have read all her books. I was a little disappointed in this one. It was enjoyable but seemed to be lacking her usual magic. I think this would be perfect as a YA book. Teenagers would enjoy and learn from this book. It just seemed a bit too juvenile and simple for an adult read.
1,Pointless waste of time and money,"Having read some of Berg's other books, I bought this one expecting something similar. I was very disappointed by the lack of interesting material, pointless tangents, and middle school drama that was True to Form. Skip this one and go for an early work by Berg."
5,Brought me back in time,Just finished this book....I loved it. So many of Katie's references to her life led me to thinking of my own childhood. Elizabeth Berg has captured what being a girl than a woman is all about and as a reader I just could not wait to pick this book up this morning and did not stop reading till it was finished. Already I miss Katie.
2,A Little Weak,"I was disappointed with this novel - I eagerly bought it thinking it would have something to offer beyond what we've seen in Berg's previous novels featuring the same character, Katie Nash. Instead, we get a re-cap of the other two books peppered with some extra prepubescent teen angst - more suitable for a young adult reader. This should have been displayed and promoted as such.I hope this is the last we see of the boring Katie Nash (God help us all if we follow her though adulthood."
2,Not true to form,"I'm a fan of Berg, but this book was disappointing. Nothing new happens to Katie Nash (worthwhile) from where she left off in Durable Goods. It seems Berg didn't have her heart into this book, lost interest and just wanted to get it done to meet the publisher's deadline. It was chock full of Berg's typical descriptive analogies, but to use another analogy...that's all she wrote."
4,Enjoyable coming of age novel; great young adult reading,"True to Form continues the story of Katie Nash, the young, motherless girl who we first met in Durable Goods. Katie is now 13, and her life appears to have stabalized: her father has remarried a sweet stepmother, she has finally gotten used to her new town, and she is excited about the start of summer vacation. Of course problems still occur--the two summer jobs arranged by her father don't fit her ""dream job"" description, she desperately wants to fit in with the popular crowd, etc.--but at this point, Katie's difficulties seem to be more of the ""normal"" growing up variety as opposed to the more challenging obstacles she faced in Berg's earlier novels. Although I enjoyed reading about Katie's development into a more poised, thoughtful young woman, I found Berg's treatment of Katie to be very reminiscent of Judy Blume, and thus I think that Katie's story would be most appealing to young adult readers."
4,"this cd is great, 4 all spice girls and ginger fans!!!","THis cd is utterly great! it has somthing 4 every1. i have only 2 reasons 4 why i did not give the cd 5 stars. 1. the single 'Look At Me' did not stun me, and i dont like the video much. 2. I truly am a huge spice girls fan, and i myuch rather enjoyed geri in the group. i think she would've been better off not ditching her platforms and red hair. but other than that, this cd is wonderful. geri may not have the greatest voice, but she has a lot of spunk + attitude, and a good taste in music. her new image really goes along w/ her new sound style,and ballads on the record such as 'walk away' and 'lift me up' really sound like the story of her ditching her former band mates. songs like 'goodnight kiss' and 'mi chico latino' are really great to dance to, and i think that anyone who enjoys jazz, pop, + good music should really give this album a good listen. geri, i luv you!"
1,give me a break,"Ok, I know I've only heard ""Look at Me"" on Mtv, but just by hearing that one pathetic song, I can see this CD is not worth the plastic they use to cover it. Geri Halliwell has no musical talent whatsoever. She can not sing or write music. Her biggest mistake was leaving the Spice Girls, even though the Spice Girls have gotten a lot better without her. The only thing Geri has going for her are her looks, and those only go so far. I suggest she tries a job modeling. Do not waste your money on her music!"
1,A waste of money!,"DO NOT buy this album. Every song is weak and just, well, let's face it: stupid. Halliwell, if she does have talent, does not display it in the least and every song is an embarrassment. The other post-Spice Girls should be ashamed to say they let Halliwell into their once-successfull group. I tried to sell this album for one dollar at a tag sale last month and it didn't go. It's a waste of a nickel, and Halliwell better quit her day job."
2,Geri's voice is almost unbearable,"Sometimes you wonder why some people are pop S.T.A.R.S.. Geri Halliwell is surely one of them. When I saw her in her interviews I felt she is a very sympathetic and down-to-earth lady and she might be a good actress for some soap opera, but that's it. Her singing voice is utterly awful and unpleasant (even on CD). She has to sing every song in a low tone so that people think she has a strong voice. I mean a voice does not need to be strong but Halliwell's voice has an awful sound besides. Every single song on ""Schizophonic"" becomes annoying and a pain in the neck due to Halliwell's weird tones. Hope sympathetic Ms. Halliwell changes her career to TV presenter or TV actress cuz she is not a bad entertainer and that's why I have to give her 2 stars, really only for being sympathetic surely not for her music."
4,It's good. Worth listening to.,"I bought the CD yesterday of course. I have heard it 3 times already. It is a decent Cd from Geri, considering she didn't have the greatest voice in the Spice girls and still doesn't. But the lyrics and music help her make this an enjoyable piece of work. My three favorite songs are Walkaway, Someone's watching over me, and Sometime. Those are beautiful songs. Good job Geri on your solo effort. I knew you could do it."
1,it leaks mayonnaise,"I have heard this cd and it wasn't my fault. I accidently heard it, and what I heard sounded like like the spice girls missig two breasts. It was garbage and if I could I would not even give it a star. It doesn't deserve that much. It just sounded to much like a woman trying really hard to make money for a talent she never possessed."
4,GREAT CD!!,One of the best new cds to be released this year. I hated The Spice Girls but this cd really is good!! Go Geri!! Go girl!
1,The Worst.....Awful,i borrowed this Cd from my friend when i listened to it it was awful!! She sounds like a broken record! she was better with the Spice Girls! Don't spend your hard working money on this trash!
4,Better than I thought it would be,"As a shameless fan of alternative/indie AND the Spice Girls, I couldn't pass this CD up. The lyrics to the songs are silly and inane, but they're no less silly than anything else out there; and the songs have GREAT hooks. All in all, it's a mature step forward for the former Ginger Spice."
3,asi-asi,"I absolutley loves some of the songs on Schizophonic, but it did leave a little to be desigered. What she lacks in voice is made up with all the energy New York City uses in a year. Very impressive. I love some songs, don't like some, and some I like until you get into the lyric 'Hey little girl with those big blue eyes, you don't know what your doing, you're so grown up, I watch you gind the little nut you're screwing.' Parents: don't get for you 6 year old who was crushed when Geri left, and if you do, get the CD, record certain songs onto a tape, and give them that."
5,"MMM, MMM good!","I am so impressed with her solo album. It's great how she can go and reinvent herself after the falling of the spice girl empire. I like all the songs on this album and I have listened to it 24-7(well, practically!) since I got it. My favorites are LOOK AT ME, BAG IT UP, GOODNIGHT KISS, and well, pretty much all of the tracks are my faves. I love this cd and I think that anyone who likes the Spice Girl's music would love this too. Even if you don't like the Spice girls, I recommend this cd because it makes you feel good and it's MMM,MMM good!"
5,i love this song it touch me alot,i brught SCHIZOPHONIC today an i love the song LOOK AT ME LIFT ME UP WALKAWAY is a song i love it tell you how she left the spice girl IM CHICO LATINO is a song make you wantto shake your bum GOOD NIGHT KISS is a jazz song BAG IT UP SOMETIME LET MELOVE YOU SOMEONE'S WATCHING OVER ME YOU'RE IN A BUBBLE GERI HALLIWELL YOU ARE DOING GOOD GIRL AN YOU LOOK GOOD AN KEEP UP THE WORK PEOPLE BY THE ALBUM
1,So disappointed,I was so disappointed by this album. I expected so much more. Geri's voice on her own leaves much to be desired. This is a set of the most uncreative pop songs I've heard in a long time. I'm so disappointed.
1,Geri the copycat!,"Melanie C's new album is great. She has soul, voice and messages in the lyrics. And she makes her own kind of music. Geri's new album is awful because she has ugly voice and she is copying Spice Girls. Listen to her music. Same as Spice Girls! She's probably too stupid to do something own...This album had few good tracks and they were ""Look at Me"" and ""Mi Chico Latino"" but others are boring and you can hear the Spice Girls music in the back.I don't like Geri because she doesn't take singing seriously. Her lyrics doesn't have meaning! Geri is very bimbo woman and she should stop making music, because her music is ridicculous!I'd love to review this with 0 stars, but like you can see I can only give 1 star... Bad thing!"
3,Hits and misses - but plenty of feeling,"When I first heard that Geri Halliwell was pursuing a solo career, I feared the worst - after all she was hardly reknowned for her singing skillsin the Spice Girls. However, 'Schizophonic' contains several surprisingly good tracks - the perfect summer anthem 'Mi Chico Latino', the gloriously OTT 'Bag It Up', the powerful 'Lift Me Up' and the touching 'Something's Watching Over Me' - but although the high points are superb, the low points are horrific. 'Walkaway' is a ballad that the Spice Girls wouldn't even release as a B-side, the 'jazz' feel of 'Goodnight Kiss' and 'You're In A Bubble' are appalling. However, despite her still-fairly weak voice and lack of consistency throughout the album, you get the impression that a lot of feeling has gone into the recording of this album. Well done Geri - you can only improve from here."
1,"Bad, really bad","She is the worst singer that i've heard in my entire life.Why someone like her can record a cd? Her video ""Bag It Up"" is so stupid. She wants to be a modern Madonna, but she is not like Madonna. Let me say more, She think that she is sexy, beatiful! . She needs a mirror! Why is she outside of Spice Girls? Two reasons: Pride and Money."
2,Yuck...!,"I did not like this cd at all! The only song that i like is ""Walk Away"" which is a beautiful ballad. The rest if it is trash! I guess I just thought the cd would be good cause she used to be a Spice Girl and I'm a fan of them. Well,I never heard her sound this terrible. I guess that's because the other Spice Girls were better than her and they drowned her out. Oh well. Melanie c always has her solo album....."
3,Average Outing,"From the overwhelmingly positive reviews that this cd has earned so far I expected this to be a life altering experience. This was far from the case. The cd is very ""okay"" but absolutely nothing more. Some of the slow songs are ridiculous (""Lift Me Up"" is a prime example) and Geri's voice seems best utilized with it is covered with lots of background noise (case and point being that ""Look at Me"" and ""Bag It Up"" are the two best songs here). If you are looking for some truely excellent music from Britain I would suggest buying Robbie William's ""The Ego Has Landed"". He is kinda the male equivalent to Miss Halliwell (I hope this isn't offending you Robbie!). They both are larger than life entertainers who rely on camp and attitude to get their message across. It's just that Mr. Williams does it so much better."
4,Brilliant,"I thought that this was a brilliat CD and after seeing an interview with Geri, I just had to bye it which i had no regrets about doing. I think that if she could improve her Cd it would be by adding some more spanish style music with her mother being spanish. The CD is for everyone and alot of thought has been put into each and every song. I did not like the spice girls but Geri is a one off and I congratulate her for going solo as it was a brilliant move. It was a big step which she took, as her whole career was at risk. The CD is really good and varied. I reccomend anybody to bye it."
5,GERI HALLIWELL KICKS PURE A$$PHALT!,"Geri Halliwell's album ""Schizophonic"" rocks! Her songs are great, and she has a great voice. To everyone out there: Buy the album, you'll love it! Geri, We love you!!"
5,Mi Chico Latino is the best song,"When I heard that Geri was going to do a solo album my firts thought was can se really do that? Because she hasent the best voice. But I goit real suprised when I heard ""Look at me"" for the first time and her voice...it's sounds much better now then when she was in the Spice Girls. My personal favorite songs are ""Look at me"", ""Mi chico latino"", ""Bag it up"" and ""Let me love you"". I can rely to all these songs. But I'm sad the hear that her album is not doing so good in the album sales. Here in Sweden her single ""Look at me"" got at Nr. 16 at the higest and her album isnt even on the swedish album chat yet.But anyway I wish Geri all the luck and she was always my favorite in the Spice Girls and I know that her solo careere will be a sucsess!!! All my love to you Geri!!!!Klas"
3,schizophonic,1.Look at me-good song but after you here it a while it's not so great** 2.lift me up-**** 3.Walkaway-an ok slow song*** 4.mi chico latino-an ok latin song*** 5.goodnight kiss-horrible* 6.bag it up-an excellent song to dance & sing to!***** 7.sometime-an excellent song that changes its mood!***** 8.let me love you-a great song to sing to!***** 9.someone's wathcn over me-not that great** 10.your in a bubble-it's ok***
2,I am sorry but Geri cant sing,"Well here here the musically miserable Geri. She can't sing. You can hear her pant in the song Lift Me Up when she tries to scale the high notes, but I am sorry, it's over before it even began... Even with the digital enhancements, she still cant carry a decent tune. YTou'll be better off doin' other stuff, Geri!"
5,Geri comes of age.,"Best move or Worst Mistake?? It could have been either, but I think that Geri has given us a great album and answered her critics in the best way possible. She's keep quiet about the break up and interestingly, now it seems that Mel B. is getting her claws out! miaow Scarey or Scared?? The album has something for everyone,even Your mother would like it! Good effort Geri. When's the tour dates coming??"
1,GINGER GOES BLAND,"Why Geri Halliwell left the Spice Girls to pursue a solo career is beyond me - what was she thinking?? Although she has improved her look, her musical ability us is terrible. All you have to hear is Look At Me. She is the second of the original five to release a solo single (Mel C's When You're Gone)with one major difference: Sporty can sing. Her disastrous debut has proved that she is no Robbie Williams. So unless you're a die-hard Geri fan or just have bland taste in music, stay clear of Schizophrenic...oops, Schizophonic."
4,it's all about track number 4!!!!!! i love it!!!,Geri rocks. She doesn't even need the spice girls to make great music. SHE has talent!!! This album proves it!! Keep up the good work Geri!
1,What were you thinking Geri??!!,"Geri, Geri, What were you thinking??!! You can't sing worth a damn!You're song writing skills are on kindergarten level.Even there I have heard better. My dogs sound better than you do. Do yourself a favor and model, act, do whatever but don't ever release another album. Please for the sake of humanity, don't do it!!"
1,Are you people CRAZY?,"Ok, first of all I didn't even wanna look this stupid lady up, but I thought that I would get a laugh at all of the horrible reviews....well I was wrong and I have to say I'm dissapointed. I hate Geri Halliwell and I wish she would dissapeer for good...actually, when she left the ""GREAT"" Spice Girls she pretty much did. She's only around sometimes because of her Spice popularity and if it wasn't for them Geri would have never had the opportunity to make an album. Geri needs to shut that awful voice up....FAST p.s. sorry to be so harsh...but look at what she did to the Spice Girls fans everywhere...She didn't even do the American tour but you know what? They didn't need her...they were better without her. Then again, when she was in the group she never sang anyway...maybe thats why no one missed her. They look better as 4"
4,Geri still got spice.,Although this album is not a masterpeice it is when compared to other solo projects from other who ventured out on their own. Geri gives you the best of what Spice Girls was all about. You have your dance pop and sweet ballads. Geri does good on her own.
2,Definitely Not Impressive,I was a Geri fan when she was in the Spice Girls but I'm very disappointed in this album. Shedefinitely should've stayed with the Spice Girls.
5,Pure Geri! :o),"Geri Halliwell has always been my favorite Spice Girl, and I was very impressed by ""Schizophonic"". It's really different and it's even better. Geri has a lot of talent and I think she got to express herself more as a solo artist, which is really great! I'm very proud of her for making this CD, and I hope she comes out with another some after this!!!! :o)"
4,"If you don't like her, this might make you change your mind","I must admit, even though I am a Geri fan, I was a little sceptical of my purchase on Monday. BUT ITS GREAT!! This is the sort of album where you find yourself singing the beginning of the next track in the gap after the last track has finished. I bought Barenaked Ladies - Stunt at the same time and I'm afraid thats just sitting on top of the CD player. My only slight critisism would be that she hasn't been particularly experimental, although it is her first album and she says it's supposed to be for everyone. She's done a great job, I just hope she can keep it up."
5,What A Great Comeback!!!,"I heard the song ""Look At Me"" and I thought it was so good. It's different from such songs like ""Wannabe"", etc... This proves that she can write as well as sing other things. She was my favorite Spice Girl, now she's my favorite artist. Geri, if you're reading, We (your fans) are all looking at you, cause of the great songs your writing and singing. Keep it up G."
5,GO GERI!,The new album Schizophonic is briliant! Look At Me - the first single is very poppy The next single Mi Chico Latino we'll be #1 for sure!As you can see when she left the Spice Girls she took with her the music style. even better.I wasn't Geri fan until Schizophhonic.GO GERI! if you didn't bought it so go. NOW!P.S WHOULD YOU COME TO ISRAEL ANYTIME....PLEASE?
3,"Geri's cd isn't good, but not as spicy as the Spice Girls","hey...i bought the new cd by Geri Halliwell, Schizophonic...Look at me is a great fast dance song..Lift me up and Walkaway are great mellow ballads..Mi chico latino..is great too..so is Bag it up..the rest..well, they aren't as nice as the rest..You're in a bubble and Let me love you sound like ripoffs from older songs...i think they are...Sometime is nice..so i someone's watching over me..also..if anyone bought this album and is reading this..did anyone notice that they spelled SPLIT wrong? it says spilt..lol..later"
1,THINK TWICE,"as a spice girls fan, i have to say i am very disappointed in this cd from Geri. She has the potential but her songs are all mistakes. This Cd is one I would recomend to no one. If only her other 9 tracks were as hot as ""look at me""! Geri, get some new writers QUICK! your voice is great but the music is dull. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING WORTHWHILE THAT WONT BE LOST UNDER YOUR BED OR THROWN IN THE TRASH!"
5,wicked,this cd is very good loved it. so much.........i bought copys for my friends to and they loved it.
2,"A Few highs, mostly lows in this uncreative pop moneyspinner","Geri Halliwell has no musical talent whatsoever, and her foray into a solo career is grasping at straws. This is not the kiddie-music that Spice and Spiceworld was, but I can't see exactly who it appeals to. Probably collective bad taste. Much is ego-centric small-minded pop that lacks the upbeatness of the spice girls, but there are actually some good songs here, such as 'Bag It Up' and Look at Me. Overall however it is a waste of money with strange forays into several languages, and her severe lack of vocal ability permeates the album as a whole."
4,great but a little too much repetition,"i thought that this cd was so great, but some of the songs sound the sam"
1,Geri Halliwell. Now a one hit wonder,"The album is terrible except for the song ""Look at Me"" which is the only good song. I listened to the entire album before i bought and it was a huge dissapointment to me so i didn't buy. i thought that all the songs would be as good as look at me, but i guess not.Unless you are a die hard fan don't get this album"
4,ITS SO WICKED,"I LOVE THE SONG""LOOK AT ME"". I REMEMBER I WENT TO THE AMERICA TOUR AND I WAS UPSET. THEN I SAW HOW WELL SHE CHANGE AND I HEARD THE PREMIER OF ""LOOK AT ME"" ON MTV TOTAL REQUEST LIVE. IT BLEW MY MIND. I STILL LOVE SG BUT I LOVER GERI EVEN MORE. SHE WILL PROVE SHE CAN DO IT WITHOUT MEL G, MEL C , VICKY, AND EMMA.SHE GOT THE REAL GIRL POWER TO LEAVE.WISH HER THE BEST OF LUCK AND CAN NOT WAIT TILL IT COMES OUT. I BE FIRST IN LINE TO GET IT AND I BE FIRST IN LINE TO GET TICKETS TO CONCERT WHEN SHE TOURS AMERICA. U GO GIRL.GERI # 1 FAN KATRINA ( pENSACOLA FL)"
2,GINGER'S NEW ALBUM STINKS!!!!!!!!,"I just bought Schizophonic yesterday and it sucks.The so called hit single ""Look At Me"" had a commonplace rhythm and didn't impress me at all.Don't waste your money on this album, like I did."
3,Geri is Solo,"Geri's album is ok. I love the songs, but don't really think there is musical talent in many of them. I think it's great that she is singing, but I really think, that she should take up acting. However this album is mixed sounds, unlike ANY other Spice Girls album, and that's what I like most about it! It's not just one kind of music. It's got the disco feel, it's got 50's feel, and it's got the latin feel! If you like the Spice Girls, this album is good, and I recommend that you get it!"
4,"GREAT SONGS, SMART LYRICS......BUT WEAK VOICE.","Most of the songs are really great...is a varying album, so you won't get bored. it would be the example of a perfect pop album, if it wasn't for her voice...her vocal capacities are very, very limited. but while her voice doesn't qualify, songs like ""look at me"", ""bag it up"" and ""ou're in a bubble"" are really good, funky up-tempo songs . ""walk away"" is a great ballad. ""lift me up"" and ""sometime"" are really catchy mid-tempo songs. not much to say about ""mi chico latino""...just that her spanish pronunciation is good when singing....but aweful when talking. ""goodnight kiss"" is a great kind of 60's song...pretty similar to ""the lady is a vamp"" by the spice girls, but much better than that one. not formula lyrics, but smart ones. good album....too bad she can't sing better."
4,"Stop, Look, Listen","Unlike many fans, I wasn't suprised that Geri could whip out a party pop album almost on Spice level. She was the fiesty ginger-haired pop queen after all. Similar to the fates of Melanie C's Northern Star and the Spice Girls's Forever, this didn't blow up here in the US, but it did quite well in Britain, taking three number one singles, ""Mi Chico Latino"", ""Lift Me Up"", and ""Bag It Up"". A fun little pop collection, showing Geri has a perfectly fine voice, which suits what she sings. She also has a sophmore solo album, entitled ""Scream If You Wanna Go Faster"", that is even better than this, but may not see the light of day in US shops."
5,Geri goes up¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°¬°,"The album Schizophonic of Geri Halliwell is great, all the songs included are good, even though some of them are better,all the album is good. So ¬°CONGRATULATIONS GERI!"
5,Mi Chico Latino,"""Superb""...I'm a type of person who rarely to listen to music but this song really gets my attention. I have been playing ""Mi Chico Latino"" over and over again and I never get tired of hearing the lyrics. The beat makes me wanna dance and sing at the same time, and it gives me energy in whatever I'm doing. Also, the song seems to have a ""potion."" What kind? It is up to you to discover. I had recommended this song to my friends and they love the song as much as I do. Therefore, if you have not listen to it yet,I suggest that you let this song take you away. I bet that you'll adore it too."
5,COOL! IT ROCKS!,"I HAD ALWAYS BEEN A GERI FAN WHEN I HEARD SHE LEFT THE SPICE GIRLS I COULDN'T BELIEVE AND I THOUGHT WHY DID SHE LEFT ""THE BEST GROUP OF ALL TIMES""?BUT NOW I SEE WHY ...!"
4,Unique,"I found a Melanie Wells book at the library a few months ago and since then have read several of her books. I enjoyed reading this book, although I found it a bit unbelievable at times. A major pro: the main character, Dylan Foster, is very likable. She has a keen sense of humor. She's bigger than life in that you want to see what she does next, but she's normal in that you can imagine her shopping in the next grocery-store aisle down from you. Another pro: Ms. Wells has stepped outside the box of Christian fiction. A con: do you really want this cover creeping out your guests from the bookshelf? :) Better hide the book somewhere in the middle!Her writing didn't grip me like Dekker's or Francine Rivers', but it is very promising. I look forward to see what she'll come up with next."
4,Pirx and the nonlinear,"Through the eyes and mind of the now more experienced Pirx, Lem draws conclusions of future's hold on human & android relations, philosophical and psycological attachments included.For a quick, classic Lem read, this is one of the tops. The collection starts with a few shorts, though deep contemplation, and finishes with two superb longer stories. My two favorites are 'The Accident' (short) and 'The Inquest' (long)."
1,acupressure step by step,"The book disappointed me because there is no picture of meridians though the author refers to them constantly. Besides, I prefer to operate with chinese names of the points which I did not find in the book. And finally, the structure is really confusing to me."
5,Great,"Great. Should be in the library of every person who takes responsibility for their health, and that should be every person."
2,not the best book ever!,"The book was recomended to me by a teacher who said it was a great book.When I read it at first I believed her, but as the book went on I say how boreing the book realy was!If you like books with dull taste and an even duller plot you would like this book alot.The book has absolutly no humor or anyhting in that concept!So in conclusion don't read it, unless if used for a sleeping aid!"
5,EXCITING AVENTURE GOLD JOURNEY FOR JASON,THE PERSON IN THIS BOOK IS NAMED JASON WHO WANTS GOLD REALLY BAD!JASON HEARS THAT THERES A GOLD RUSH SO HE'S GONNA GO FOR THE GOLD!
1,YO YO YO SUP,"YO, YO, YO, SUPI wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. First, I found it boring to read. I didn't understand why Jason would leave his home in search of gold. It was dangerous and he could have got hurt or killed. There was one part when bears attacked Jason and his dog. Jason's dog protected him and scared the bears away. It was a lot of action and I did like that part. I would try another book by this author, but with a little more action."
5,A RALLY REALLY REALLY GR8 Book,"I read this in 2 days and it was excellent. I recomend it to anyone in the world, thats how good it is. Its about Jason Hawthorne and how he gets to the Klondike and what happens on the way. I loved this book."
4,Not appropriate for everyone,"As an adult I really enjoyed this book. When I read it outloud to my 4th grader I had a much different response. She was deeply disturbed by the graphic and violent story line. If your child is ready to tackle issues such as suicide, animal cruelty, dismemberment, starvation and other types of dying then this book is for them. Considering I do not allow my child to watch R rated movies, this book was not appropriate for her. Just a warning to parents. READ THIS BOOK FIRST!!!!"
5,Amazing book,I am a 14 year old and i loved this book. It was a page turner. I couldnt put the book down. This book was exciting and realistic. I hope you like it too.
4,Jason's Gold,"This book was very exciting. I didn't want to put it down. I wanted to see what would happen to him if he made it all the way. Although Jason had some hard times, I wish I could have done all the things he did. It really helped me to understand what the people who went looking for gold in Alaska went through and how many people never found gold or died. He also meets many famous people along the way. I recommend this book to anyone who wants adventure."
2,Switch Turned Off,I liked the first book and it really got me thinking of all those IQ's in my life and how to get rid of them. I think I expected the same thing with this book but for whatever reason I came away feeling let down. It just seemed like less substance than the first and more of a fluff of highlights while trying to cling on to book 1. NOT a bad read but not as inspiring as the first.
1,The book was not very clear,"I thank the author for writing about an interesting topic, however did not feel the issue was explained well. It was not written in an easy to understand manner."
5,Flipping the Switch review,"Another outstanding book from John Miller. I found this to be another easy, one hour, read with a powerful message that is applicable to both our business and personal lives. I would highly recommend this book to everyone! It is a great follow up to John's original ""QBQ! The Question Behind The Question."" It stands alone, however, if you have not read the first book, I would suggest buying both! You will not be disappointed. I have read so many second books that are just a re-write of the original, this one is not!"
1,Shallow and Poorly Written,"QBQ is common sense. For a top motivational speaker I would expect a little more depth than three paragraph chapters with little gems of wisdom culled from office banter or internet rumors. I'm sure there are other authors out there who write about personal responsibility and accountability and have more to offer....Oh wait, I'm supposed to say ""WHAT can I get out of this book that will help me have a better attitude about poorly written motivational books? HOW can I be a better reader so that I can truly profit from this juvenile presentation?"""
3,It could have been better.,"While ""QBQ"" told us what a QBQ was, ""Flipping the Switch"" tells us how to implement it. However, I felt that Miller spent far too much time rehashing the principles of ""QBQ."" He gave us letters, examples, and demonstrations of how the principles can work in our lives, but at only a little over 120 pages long, I felt that space could have been used more wisely. Rather than reading examples, I'd have preferred to read more about how to apply these principles more carefully to my own life.All in all, this was still a worthwhile read. It wasn't exactly what I expected but neither was it a waste of time."
2,Arcade style,"Well..for an acade game it's ok. But it lacks online play, and you cannot unlock any of the aircraft without first going through the campaign and ""earning"" them. Hello? I pay x$ and I have to ""earn"" the right to use a specific aircraft?How not fun, dumb actually. No cheat codes will unlock them in the PC game, though there are unlocks for the PS2, X-box etc. How nice of Lucas Arts.You'd be better off buying a flight sim for Battle of Britain say, that has all the aircraft available at once without any prerequsite advanced skills required, or hours of play put into it first so you can use an ME-109"
2,I can belive it !!,"If this is a lucas art game`s. I don?t know what happend with it.This is a very bad game. I have it, new. I had played many times but i can find the interest on it.The planes can not be total contoled. Bad graphics,well bad when we had looked anothers lucas art games. It`s simple to me. I don`t like it. I perfer IL-2,expansion of it and Pacific figthers.I put my money on trash with this game.Sorry It is the true."
1,Really Disappointing,"As a fan of both Bauhaus and Peter Murphy's solo work, I found this CD to be a real letdown. I've heard bootlegs that sound better than this official release! Terrible sound quality makes it sound like a garage band rehearsal session. You'd be much better off getting the Volume I and II set for a wonderful retrospective of this seminal band's work."
4,True Classic!!,"The final concert. This album will be around for some time and it should be in your Bauhaus collection. Yes, the sound isnt that great, but who cares..your a Bauhaus fan?...right?."
5,DOO-WOP IS STILL STRONG!!,"THIS IS THE FINEST EXAMPLE OF DOO-WOP EVER OFFERED!! THE AMAZON SERVICE WAS,AS USUAL,EXCELLANT. I WILL CONTINUE TO USE AMAZON FOR ALL MY SHOPPING NEEDS. THANK YOU"
3,Dated but not worthless,"I have a copy of this book that I got from my sister along with some other books. I thot most of the information in there was useful. I wish the Editor had put more work into it though, it is pretty skimpy in some places. Anyway if this book was all the info you had it would be okay. It is worth the price."
2,Wasted Past,"I must say this book was disappointing. Although there are some nice photos I find a lot of the book is filled with poor photos of celebrities that could be surpassed in quality by the paparazzi. Poor editing hurt the content, the poorer photos should have been left out and the better ones enlarged. More photos of David Hockney and his friends and more information about the author's relationship with Hockney would have made the book more valuable. If someone one is looking for an insight into David Hockney and the author's relationship they will find very little material. Unfortunately it appears that being around great artists and beautiful people doesn't necessarily make a good book. Like the movie, A Bigger Splash, this book is a rejection of the artistic and creative ideas that Hockney espoused."
1,Can't leave this one on the coffee table,"I ordered this thinking it was a fun coffee table book about fashion from the 60s and 70s, as the cover would have you believe. The photos were boring & mostly of unrecognizable people. Plus, it contained a full frontal male nude shot, which made it too X-rated for me to leave out on the coffee table. I can't have my mother looking at this book! Thumbs down."
5,Super Fast and Solid,Pros: Incredibly fast file transfer rate. Solidly built. Metal case outclasses everything in its price range. Retractable USB connector-no cap-excellent design.Cons: A little too long for my liking. Shoulders at retractable USB connection are a little too wide for recessed USB slots on PC's and Laptops.
3,"Nice, but retracting connector isnt as nice as it sounds","There are plenty of 512 mb flash memory sticks for sale so I think the main selling point for this one is its durability and the retractable connector. It was one of the reasons I chose this one because losing the caps is always an issue. That being said, Id rather have one with a cap because the retracting tip doesnt always stay open when Im trying to connect it to the USB port. Sometimes it will retract itself making it a pain to connect. I cant complain about the usefullness of the item, its nice and works well when connected, but in my opinion the retractable tip is actually a bad idea. I worry about how long it will hold up since its already starting to retract inside the case when I try to attach it to my PC or Laptop."
5,Great USB Disk,"This is a reliable, great looking, convenient usb disk. I am a student and use multiple computers at different locations. This disk is perfect for keeping the information and documents I need with me all the time.A really nice thing about this product is that unlike other usb disks, it doesn't have a cap! So you can't lose the cap. It instead has a retractable connector."
1,Worked for two days.,"Bad quality product. Worked for two days only.I used to trust on San Disk Products, but now I'll think twice before buying any product from San Disk. I'm very upset"
2,Where did the light go?,"I don't normally write reviews but this is important because I bought this item because of the reviews I saw about it. Unfortunately I must have missed the ones that were bad.The speed is good, the price is good, and yeah its hard to break. However, for no good reason it just stopped working. The blue light went out and it stopped working.The tech support guy seemed to know that this might have been the problem as soon as I started talking to him.Buy at your own risk. Back up your data often."
4,Buen Producto,Producto de Excelente Calidad y Aspecto.Quizas el Unico detalle es que debi haberlo comprado de mayor capacidad. :)
2,Like a turtle.,"Make no mistake, this product is tough on the outside. Like a turtle, its hard shell protects it from the elements. You could drive a tank over this thing. The inside is a different story. The actuall usb drive that slides out is very flimsy-- like the body of a turtle without his shell. The locking mechanism that keeps the slide extended is hit or miss. There should be a cover or door on the USB connector side as the connector is exposed and prone to dirt, etc.My drive quit working after 2 months of use. My theory is: the weight of the case itself puts too much strain on the fragile USB drive causing it to fail. I opened a ticket with Sandisk which was closed without my knowledge. I opened another one and am waiting for resolution."
1,Great promise - then the lights went out,"We bought 5 of these in November. First one went bad after a week. Today the second one also went bad on another PC altogether - same problem, the blue light won't come on anymore!! Technical Support tried to help but, again, the thing just doesn't work, it won't work, or it can't work. They said send this one back too! I got a replacement the first time, now I just want to send them all back. I don't have the time to waste to putz around with poorly manufactured gear."
1,faulty product,"SanDisk flash drives have a really short life compared to lexmark, A-Data, and other USB flash drives. It worked fine for a short while and died. I have older smaller memory flash drives made by other companies that I purchased well before my SanDisk ones and they are all still working. I've found I'm most happy with A-Data's Jogr due to the price and lifetime warranty(all USB devices will eventually ware out the connection but SanDisk wares out unreasonably fast). Not all USB flash drives by the same company are the same, I do have one flimsy plastic cased 128MB one from SanDisk that is still working fine."
1,Failed after 1 month,"Have not written a bad review before and have used SanDisks products for several years.The Cruzer Titanium is one of the best looking flash drives I have seen.I ignored the comments about the drive failing, thinking that all products have some defected units coming off the line and these people were just unlucky. Then mine fail after just over a month and I am beginning to think that there is something wrong with this model.I still will use other SanDisks products.Maybe I was just another unlucky one.So the question is, do you feel lucky?"
1,flip a coin,"My workplace has been using these for a year or so, and we've had about a 50% failure rate within a year of use. One day the little blue light just decides not to illuminate and the key is not recognized by any PC. The things are simply not reliable."
2,The best,"SanDisk Cruzer Titanium is very a really solid, fast cle USB with a very large advantage: the software SanDisk CruzerLock that more. Easy A to use, reliable. I strongly recommend it has all"
1,Believe the bad reviews,You should believe the bad reviews on this product. I took a chance because I loved the design. Bad mistake.I needed the piece of junk at a customer site and it let me down after less than six months of owning it and light use. It just stopped working. There was no possibility of recovery. It never went near a magnetic field -- I was very careful.Edit: I have to give SanDisk credit. They replaced the product and were quite quick about it too. I needed a flash drive right away so I bought a different brand. I gave the replaced SanDisk to my niece.
1,These drives have serious issues.,"Just like everyone else, my drive failed after a couple weeks. Sandisk eventually replaced it, but only after I had to argue with their inane tech support."
1,Failed after minimal use,"I researched all USB thumb drives before I bought this, my first one. It has a nice form factor and sufficient capacity at the time. I figured I would have daily use for it, but it was eventually used only a few times a week.One day I dropped it, and not from a considerable height mind you, and the little button that slides the USB attachment out no longer ""stuck"" in the out position, which meant you had to hold it in place when you inserted it into an outlet. That was a minor annoyance. THEN after a few months, it failed on me for no reason whatsoever.Now, I am good with my products, and nothing ever fails on me that quickly UNLESS it's a faulty product. A friend bought the same thing and it too failed on him. If he told me he was buying it, I would've warned against it as I am warning you now. I like SanDisk, but this product is not good. Get a Cruzer Crossfire instead, preferably one that doesn't needs to be ""pushed out""."
1,Unreliable...don't get lulled w/false sense of security,"Device unexpectedly stopped working after 9 months. Has not been thru a washing machine, fallen in the ocean or been run over by a truck! Just nestled in my briefcase. Bullet-proof case is great gimick, but this device is unreliable as a backup for ""road"" files. Might be better off using your PDA with a large SD card."
5,Virtually Indestructible,"I've had this bad boy for about a year and a half. I've never had a problem, the case is tough and the way the usb port slides in and out protects it so well vs. other thumb drives I've had.This morning I heard some clunking in the clothes dryer. I didn't think much of it but when I went to take the clothes out, my beloved cruzer fell out of the pile of laundry. This thing went through a full wash and dry cycle.I didn't have high hopes, but figured I'd plug it in and see what happened. It was already dry (the dry cycle took care of that ;-). The little blue light came on immediately and windows recognized it and opened it up. No files lost, working perfectly.Any electronice device that can take that kind of abuse and keep going is GOLD in my book."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"I purchased 3 Cruzer Titaniums back in Oct 2005. The one I use quit working after only a month. I spent two weeks trying to convince SanDisk Tech Support that I knew how to operate a computer before they decided the device was defective and would replace it. I returned the product via Fedex 3 weeks ago. No response from SanDisk. Just a black hole. No money, no product, no warranty. I will never buy a SanDisk product again!"
1,Broke after short while,"It was great for a couple of months and then got hot, then stopped working. Blue light sometimes comes on, but the device has malfunctioned."
5,Greatest USB drive,"This product has not let me down yet. I have it on my keychain and it goes with me everywhere. I haven't had any data problems with it, and the write speed is perfect. I recommend this to anyone needing a reliable USB drive."
1,Lasted One Whole Week,"I just returned the unit for a full refund. After having my SanDisk for one week, it failed to read on more than one pc. Oddly, the unit had a burn like smell when I laid it to rest. Looks like Kingston will be getting my business instead. Oh well..."
1,Avoid this product,"I bought 3 of this usb devices in less than a month. 1 of them stop working without any reason after 2 days of usage. I don't want a replacement, I want a refound. Kinsgton is a better product, buy that mark."
3,"Titanium is a name, not a description!","I didn't do an awful lot of research before buying a $38 gadget. I compared the ""Titanium"" drive to a standard drive, with caps and no sleeve, and figured the titanium sleeve design would hold up to pockets better than a bare drive.Somehow, I did not see the bit about ""Liquidmetal space-age metal casing"" - not titanium. Or the bit about ""titanium coated metal casing"" - not structurally titanium.I was very annoyed when my ""cool"" ""titanium"" drive arrived and proved to really only be titanium-brand. I suppose I have no one but myself to blame, as I do see all these warning flags when I revisit the page, but I would like to warn anyone who might have skipped from the photos to the review.It *is* a nice design, btw - looks cool and feels nice in the hand."
1,flimsy,"Depending on where your USB holes are located, it can take some maneuvering to get the card inserted without pushing the plug back into the casing. After about a month of use, the USB plug-in part got stuck in the Titanium casing, and when I finally managed to get the plug-in part out, the two halves of the casing came apart. I've taped the case together and the device still works, but I have gone back to buying SanDisk's small, capped Cruzer flash drives."
2,Disappointing...but it looked good,"Neat idea - usb plug retracts into the case. Unfortunately, the case popped open after a month, and the drive stopped working after a year."
2,Cool-Looking Piece of Crap,"Yes, the drive looks cool, and the titanium casing is virtually indestructible, but the actual durability of the flash drive itself is laughable. If you are considering this drive, please look at the reviews. While many praise it, there are quite a few people who have indicated that the drive has failed them. I have had mine for less than 6 months, and I have babied it. I typically carry it in my shirt pocket for goodness sakes! Despite my careful treatment, the drive has stopped working. I personally suggest that the would-be buyer look into Lexar. I have had a 128mb lexar drive for several years, and it is now what I am using."
2,mine too!,"""Failed exactly 1 month from purchase, February 27, 2006Reviewer: An electronics fanI checked my order history. I bought this on January 27th and it failed the same day in February...""I hear you man.. alot of my work was on there and was lost when mine just stopped showing up when plugged in. Also, it seems that the metal conducts alot of heat, for the month i had mine, it seemed to warm up during use. Well, i guess i am getting a replacement and hopefully will be better."
2,Will not sharpen many sissors,"Many sissors have a 45 degree edge on one cutting edge, but this jig will not allow this much of an angle. This jig was purchased to sharpen all my shears and other sissors, but it is not capable of doing the job. Bad design and overpriced."
2,disappointed,"As the other viewer mentioned, it does not adapt to all types of scissor blades. If you can't take apart your scissors, don't bother with this jig."
2,"Helpful, but not what I was looking for","Yes, the week-at-a-glance lesson plans are nice, until you take a close look at them. They require you to use materials not provided in the book. Which wouldn't be a big undertaking if they actually took the time to compile a list for you of materials that you needed to have on hand along with a time line for obtaining them, e.g., for week four have the following books and supplies on hand. This shows poor organization and editing on the part of those who put this book together. In my more cynical moments, I wonder if McGraw-Hill actually wants homeschoolers to succeed, given that public schools comprise such a large part of their market.So yes, there is helpful material in this book, but any homeschooling parent can easily put together their own materials just as effectively."
4,What a find!,"This book may just save my sanity. 36 weeks of daily lessons, in 6 subjects, all planned out for you! All you have to do is ""read and do""! Could it be any better? Well, yes. For one thing, the pages are all front and back, even the ones that aren't part of a particular week, even the ones that have cut and paste activities on the other side. That is my main gripe. Also, this book is laid out to follow the public school calendar (start in fall, end in early summer). We started school in January and are planning to end in September, so I've had to juggle a few of the activities and lessons around so that we're not studying Autumn in Winter, and so on. Those two snafus aside, this is a great, well-rounded book, and will help you to cover all the bases. You'll need to supplement with library books and whatever other materials you and your child desire."
3,A bit easy for my son who was homeschooled through preschool,"This is a very well laid out book. I enjoy the worksheets, I enjoy many of the projects, additional activites and guidance given. I homeschooled my son through preschool work since age two, so at age four he knows his letters and numbers quite well and was ready for a bit more of a challenge. This book, and series in particular is perfect for the beginning homeschooler, as well as the budget minded experienced homeschooler. My son desired that we up the speed a bit!"
4,Good Place To Start- If it is the first thing you do.,"Overall I am happy with this book. It lays out a full year, with interesting activities. I would not base my WHOLE curriculum on this book. Don't think this is ALL you need. You will need to visit the Library often (and probably inter library loan). If you dont have access to a color copier, you will be frustrated by the worksheets which are often printed double sides at cross purposes. This book uses the Letter A Week approach which is good if your child is weak in this area. My daughter is far beyond this, so I am having to Rethink and Replan much of it. Most activities in other subjects build on the letter of the week.. So *for me* this means much advance planning and shuffling. I am not sorry I bought it, but I wish I had seen it first hand. If you are JUST starting to homeschool, and your child can use the reinforcement of the Alphabet, this is a terrific book."
2,Not the Preferred Choice of Clamps,"The steel band clamp should only be used in one type of application. That being where you are putting two SMOOTH surfaces together, like a garden hose or radiator hose. But with a DC application of a ribbed hose, the steel band clamp is NOT the preferred choice, use the wire clamp.The steel band clamp will only strip and never be fully seated trying to compress and secure the wire rib to the smooth DC fitting. The steel banding and worm screw is not designed to do that task and provide the needed pressure to fully seat the ribbed hose. Whereas, the wire clamp will actually strattle the rib on both sides and create a perfect clamping fit.I tried to save the twenty cents over the wire clamp, and wound up stripping the clamp thread on about 50% of the applications with the steel band clamps. I antied up and spent the extra cash and got the right product, the wire clamps for the ribbed DC hose."
2,Hardly Justified By The Contents,"I purchased this somewhat expensive book with much anticipation, since I already owned The Spirit of Tibet, by Ricard. Buddhist Himalayas left me unsatisfied, chiefly for the reason that it's size and title suggest a more expansive survey than is offered by the experiences of the authors. Several of the photographs by the Follmis consist of plain and uninspired subjects. Numerous short essays, however, provide a more satisfying description of the world of Tibetan Buddhism. With the image of the re-incarnate Khyentse Rinpoche on the book cover, I come to the conclusion that this is one more book about the remarkable man the authors were privileged to know, but hardly justified by the contents."
1,Mark is right,"If you've never heard any Martinu before, this set might pass for current. I can't think of any other way it would. It's a hideous performance. If you love Martinu's music, or even if you just mildly like it, avoid this recording. Bad performances can often be revelatory. I heard a live performance of Mahler's seventh once that stumbled over every transition. But I learned more about that symphony's structure from that gawky concert than I ever had from Bernstein's near perfect recording. I'm afraid, however, that the only thing this Martinu disc reveals is how badly Mr. Fagen conducts, in this performance at least."
4,Fila Brazillia - Luck Be A Weirdo Tonight,"Luck Be A Weirdo Tonight sees Fila Brazillia moving towards a ""live band"" feel, rather than its earlier studio-processed sound. Indeed, ""Billy Goat Groupies"" has the occasional rock guitar jam, which is a little jarring. ""Hells Rarebit"" start off like a funk band, adds into a delicate synth chord to contrast the bass and drums, while ""Her Majesties Hokey Cokey"" throws in a whole horn section. ""Rustic Bellyflop"" is much more mellow, as is ""Do the Hale-Bopp,"" although the latter has a much heavier drum hit. It's a definite change of direction, and even though it's not entirely successful, it's still worth its weight in solid gold."
5,son can't get enough.,My 3 1/2 yr old requests to watch it over and over again. Glad there are so many episodes on it and ones he had never seen.
4,"Love the show, but where is the paleontologist on the DVD?","My almost 4 yo loves this DVD. This one includes 8 - ~15 minute segments all focusing on underwater dinosaurs. Unfortunately the Dr. Scott segments (the paleontologist that speaks with the kids after the cartoon portion) on the broadcast version of these episodes is not included in the episodes on this DVD. The extra bits/special features included on this DVD are accessible via the DVD-rom drive on one's computer and includes coloring pages,a dinosaur guide (outlines of dinos, not much detail in the picture, a character guide, a game and various references for the show."
3,"Love the show, where's Dr. Scott?","My son loves this show! He amazes me by his encyclopedic knowledge of dinosaurs mostly derived from this show alone. However, as much as we love it I can't give the DVDs 5 stars as I would have wanted. The great thing about the PBS show is Dr. Scott to distill the show's topic such that the dinosaur facts themselves are highlighted. The DVDs however do not have Dr. Scott which is not highlighted in the packaging or disc information. Truly disappointing since PBS could have created a great set of discs. Now I'm left with DVDs that sit on the shelf and a full DVR of Dinosaur Train."
5,LA LA LOO!,"Embrace and celebrate the fascination that preschoolers have with both dinosaurs and trains while encouraging basic scientific thinking and skills as the audience learns about natural science, natural history and paleontology! LA LA LOO! The series joins other top-ranked PBS KIDS preschool series including The Jim Henson Company's series Sid The Science Kid, which premiered in fall 2008.Dinosaur Train is seen through the eyes of Buddy, a preschool-aged Tyrannosaurus Rex. Buddy and his adoptive family of Pteranodons go for adventures on the Dinosaur Train to meet all kinds of dinosaurs in different eras and learn fascinating new facts about these incredible creatures.He can be found running around always stopping to note: ""I have a hypothesis!""GREAT SHOW! I LOVE IT JUST AS MUCH AS MY THREE YEAR OLD! LA LA LOO!"
3,Can't really make up my mind about this,"A disclaimer: I'm an atheist, believer in evolution and against teaching creationism or any kind of religious agenda in schools.That said, I can't help, but feel a wee bit uncomfortable with this show, because it feels like religious propaganda cartoon turned evolutionist. And it's not the fact that the show teaches about prehistoric time periods or basic archeological principles, it's just how it teaches them. Every time Buddy says ""I have a hypothesis!"" it feels like he says ""Oh lawdy lawd, praise da holy book!"" There's something very pushy about how this show comes across.Add to that crappy Southeast Asian animation and a pants-on-head ridiculous set up, and you will find me leaving the room when my kid starts watching this thing. Oh, and their toys are not compatible with either Thomas trains, or Chugginton ones."
3,sick sick sick!,"How about turning the tables with a MEN in prison film? Set at an SS prison camp, this was probably one of the bloodiest and grosses films until Salo, Dead Alive and Nekromantik.Though somewhat humorous, this film is essentially S&M and I would not recommend it to any newcomer to the exploitative prison film genre.The DVD print supports 16:9 televisions and appears to have good clarity and color. Sound is monaural, but that was how the film was recorded.If you want a good gross out film, check this out. If you are looking for something a little less sick but with more ladies and more humour, opt instead for ILSA: HAREM KEEPER OF THE OIL SHEIKS."
3,DID NOT LIVE UP TO THE HYPE.,"I was diappointed with the film. All he good reviews got me to expect something else. The onlything it did live up to was the amount of naked flesh. It seemed that all the girls were naked having sex or being tortured.The sex has been better in other movies. And the torture, it fell sort too. I think the film relied on too much shock value instead of realism for the torture.You got to give the director credit. They were making a explotation film and that is what he gave the viewers. Why else would you have half naked women whipping prisoners.I gave this 3 stars instead of 2 because of the time they made this film, it was up to expectations of the 70's. Then again, there was a lot of funny tabbacco being smoked back then too."
4,Ilsa She Wolf of the SS,"The DVD was more and better quality than I expected. I am very happy I went with the provider, and will again in the future!"
1,80's cheese,"I remember hearing about this movie back in the 80's. I saw it for sale so I thought I'd check it out. Whatever I paid for it, it wasn't worth it. Poorly done movie, though it was funny seeing the Hogan's Heros sets in it."
4,Depraved,"I like a lot of bad movies, if they have a silly quality to them. I think this one crosses the shakey line of depravity all the way into nauseating. I gave it four stars for what it is, which is an exploitation film taken to new depths. If you can't take a lot of blood, stay away from this one. I was expecting lots of trashy scenes. But I was not expecting the depths to which this movie sank. I was horrifed, revolted, sickened, and fascinated all at the same time. This is extreme gore. There is a level of torture I have only seen on one other vile film. This is a prison film/gore fest combination film. I like bad movies. I like bad sexpoitation movies. This one set out to take torture and violence to a new low, and it does. Be warned. This is not for those with squeamish stomachs. I think it would appeal to certain fetishists. I gave it four stars for it's no holds barred sadism, the likes of which is rare in a film. This crosses the line to a new level of indecency."
4,"The ""Citizen Kane"" of trash","For many years, I considered ""Bloodsucking Freaks"" to be the sickest, most tasteless, most offensive movie I'd ever seen. Then I saw ""Ilsa."" This movie's reputation as the trashiest exploitation movie ever made is fully deserved. I can't begin to describe it; everything you've heard about it is true. It is essential viewing for true devotees of trash cinema. Apart from the extreme gore makeup, the frequent nudity, and the classic lines of demented dialogue (none of which I can repeat here), ""Ilsa"" ups the weirdness level beautifully by having been filmed on the old Hogan's Heroes set. If you've ever seen episodes of that TV series, you'll recognize the locations instantly ... which adds infinitely to the movie's bizarro effect. A masterpiece."
5,You can't beat Ilsa!,"Released in 1974, Ilsa Shewolf of the SS is one of the very first true gore films, and still one of the most infamous. Much like Bloodsucking Freaks and I Spit On Your Grave, this movie is probably more controversial today then it was when it was released.One thing is for sure though, unlike those films, this movie is still truly shocking, thanks to better than usual effects and an even greater lack of good taste. To say Ilsa is in bad taste is a great understatement. If you're not offended by this one, you probably won't be offended by anything.Probably the nastiest bit is the woman who is boiled alive in hot water.If you have a strong stomach, and you love these over-the-top gore/exploitation films, then give this first in the Ilsa series a rent! ..."
3,Disturbing,"""Ilsa - She Wolf of the SS"" is a hard film to classify.Is it 70's soft core porn?Well, it does have the requisite nudity and simulated sex.Is it an S&M;/horror grindhouse flick?Again, it has appalling scenes of torture and sado-masochistic action.Is it a Nazi exploitation film?Hey - it's ""She Wolf of the SS"" remember? So naturally there are plenty of Nazis running around, mostly busty Arayan females.The production values are low (they used the abandoned ""Hogan's Heroes"" set), the script is mediocre and the acting is generally atrocious.Nevertheless, viewing ""Ilsa"" is a disturbing experience, to say the least."
1,"Boring, not shocking","Poorly made drivel. The only thing that shocked me was how often I looked at my watch after 20 minutes of running time.The plot for what its worth, is about the planning for, and eventual activation of, escape from the camp, ignoring totally the need for suspenseful build up, or character development.The film appears to have been made by someone who has previously been informed what a movie is, but has never actually seen one."
1,ILAS Is What It Is Trip To Nowhere,"I hear alot about this film and so I had to see it and what it is,a bad tash movie with no story line worth anyone time to watch,nothing can save it,not even it's nude ladies in it could save it.Just a all around bad movie out of 70's.Cult Classic, it isn't,just everyday tash movie.Sorry I even waste my time with it.No thiller."
2,Not that great!,"I got this movie on a recommendation by Rob Zombie, and apart from being a little brutal, it was softcore porn rubbish. I would only recommend this to horny pre-teens that can't get their hands on real porn. And ""Saw"" fans wouldn't be to into this either, as it's not near as brutal as those films."
2,This is entertainment?,"That's the horrible part of it, there's no doubt that the producers hoped to entertain certain types of people here. Since this exploitation film has become quite famous I guess they succeeded.Well, if you want to see nude women tortured (though most of those scenes are mercifully short and choppy), I suppose this is right up your alley.I saw this and another Ilsa picture out of curiosity. The other one was just as sick, but had some skillful production values. This one doesn't even have that to justify its existance."
1,A waste of time...,"This movie is terrible on so many different levels. The acting is awful. The script is absurd. No doubt many of the positive reviews stem from the bevy of gorgeous babes paraded about in the nude. But, honestly, if naked women are your pleasure, surely you can find better movies than this to watch. As I think about it, though, I suppose the S&M crowd must think that Ilsa is a great piece of work. There are certainly more than enough naked women being tortured to satisfy the needs of the freaks among us. Ilsa is a movie which many will buy just to say they saw something nasty. It is nasty but so what. It is also boring and absurd-don't waste your money."
1,JUNK,"Who had the idea for this junk? It's sad to hear the actors trying to be Germans, there's few female nudity, the girls are very ugly. Blood? That's red painting and strawberry jelly made at home. And the tortures they have are nothing. Tickles are more cruel than the tortures in this film. And the hero, he's blonde with a white smile, he's clean and just shaved, while the other prisoners are dirty and gross. Save your money for a movie with perfect chicks and a lot of female nudity, not for this junk."
2,crap warmed up,i have never seen such rubbish in my life when i bought this there would be full on sex and graphic violence its like watching an old hammer movie with a few naked women in it with pubic hair like a thstched roof of a cottage. do not believe the hype i also watched i spit on your grave and even though that wasnt as bloody it was better acted and more shocking ilsa is just a joke of a real historical moment from world war two no wonder the director took his name off it cause he knew he would be hated by any war veterans
4,A shocker in its day still holds up pretty well.,"I loved this movie from when I first saw it as a young teenager. It is about a new teacher and former GI trying to teach a bunch of 1950's juvenile delinquents. Glen Ford is the teacher and the classroom is populated by some future stars when they were very young. People like Vic Morrow and Sidney Poitier are fun to see in this story.The sound track includes Bill Haley music that was considered pretty hot stuff at the time. I understand that the movie was banned in some places because it was too wild for its time.More recently a movie called ""Dangerous Minds"" starring Michelle Pfeiffer was made and it was a complete rip-off of Blackboard Jungle. It was not even close to being as good. Actually it wasn't very good at all.I thought the original was good enough to buy so I did."
5,satisfied customer,"The dvd is in great shape like the seller said...came pretty quickly, and I am satisfied,and would use this seller again."
5,Surprising,"Often, it's necessary to take older movies with a grain of salt in order to enjoy them. This is to say that you often need to readjust your mindset to appreciate the historical context of the film. The amazing thing about Blackboard Jungle, however, is that it holds its own even today. This film is just as entertaining and its issues just as relevent now as in 1955. Great acting, compelling story - do not miss this film."
3,"ok, but atimes slow moving j.d. drama","although Blackboard Jungle is at times interesting and a bit disturbing, it is not a gang or delinquency drama as it is often believed. it is the story of a dedicated teacher in a rough school. Glenn Ford is good, but he could have done a better more riveting job. A better look at young toughs from a book by the same author is the Young Savages (1961). A better more realistic and ultimately disturbing look at youth gangs is the little known but very good film Crime In The Streets. This films takes us to the heart of teenage hoodlums"" attitude and mores. Few films have illustrated the harsh but bitter reality of a gang leader's willingness to commit murder because his manhood was threatened. This is a rather small film, but it says more than alot of so called classics that deal with this theme. By the way Reginald Rose (Twelve Angry Men, t.v. show The Defenders) wrote the screenplay."
4,Blackboard Jungle,"This is a great collectors item. Very exciting but not in it's original format. It is matted , top and bottom of picture chopped for widescreen tv viewing. It should be listed as matted widescreen. Please add this to your format descriptions. We should have the format option. I really prefer a film in it's original format for my collection.Thank you"
3,So-So Movie,This movie is NOT for a person expecting gut busting laughs. Ten bricks were delivered to the wrong address and three petty hustler thinks they are going to finally make it big---UNTIL the puerto Ricans the dope belongs to find out they have the drugs. This movie had some memorable moments but watch it on a boredom night....NOT when u are expecting to be REALLY entertained.
1,Next Day Air didn't deliever on entertainment!,What from the previews looks like a funny movie proves it's not in the final excecution! In fact it is almost depressing. Do yourself a favor and settle with watching the preview!
4,finally,FUNNY. just to see how and why it all goes down and the great ending. Was well worth the loot.
1,STUPID MOVIE..... WASTE OF MONEY,This was the most stupid movie I've ever seen. I'm glad I bought it used. I just might throw it away that's how stupid it was.
2,It's not a comedy...or a good movie,"The previews and Amazon description of this movie suggest that this is a comedy, and that the stars are Donald Faison and Mos Def. Nope. Although Faison's character is responsible for setting the sequence of events in motion, he's definitely not a main character. This is really a Mike Epps movie. As for Mos Def, it seems like the director wanted him in the movie but didn't have a part for him to play. So although Def is featured prominently in the previews, his character is inconsequential and he's on screen for less than 10 minutes.As for the movie itself, while there are some jokes, there aren't enough to make it a comedy. And as a crime drama, the plot is obvious, boring, and predictable. In fact, if you saw the extended preview, that actually is the entire movie--including the best jokes and the climax.Take a pass on this movie that couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy or a crime drama and ended up doing nothing well."
3,pam's blues,"i thought that the preview aired on tv indicated this was a funny movie, well it had some funny parts but the ending was lame, weak, if someone would have loaned me this movie before i purchased a copy, i would have definitely cancelled the order before it went into process, what a let down."
1,Bad Air,"If you make a movie with guns, drugs, language and a lukewarm chick it'll find an audience no matter how boringly repetitive the concept of misplaced drugs ending up in someone else's hands and their attempt to benefit from their new wealth goes awry. Find your FF button and just get to the, thank-goodness, brief shootout and weak ending. Summery: Story - stereotypic. Acting - what acting. Backdrop - delivery truck and apartment. Props - very fake (fortunately small amount) blood."
5,MUST READ!,"Thoroughly enjoyed this delightful mystery filled with excitement, suspense, and unique twists that leave the reader guessing at every turn.The farm setting is a wonderful stage and the author obviously knows how to hold the readers attention and keep them wanting more.I highly recommend this five star novel."
3,RAS - Rhythmic Altered State,"Ras, and his acronymic debut RHYTHMIC ALTERED STATE, roots himself firmly in Africa, tossing out the percussion on ""Do Your Dance,"" as if he's out there on the savannah. But there's a bit of Spain, as well, in ""This Is Ours,"" even if the uplifting lyrics are a little bland. Unfortunately, ""African Kangaroo"" is unremarkable jazz, and the dark dub of ""Areas of Perception"" doesn't do much for me. But the angular horns and jazzy syncopated piano chords of ""Dashing Steps"" overcome any lingering doubts, as does the Afro-jazz of ""Diggin'."" And the mellow ""Beat De La Romantique"" shows a totally different side to Ras that's quite appealing. ""Exit Routine"" ends the album on just the right note - frantic African drumming to cap a nice jazzy interlude."
3,The forgotten California,"This is a good reference book, useful but sprinkled with a little resentment. Justifiable resentment, but not useful to documenting the native peoples of the west.Stephen Estopinal, Author: El Tigre de Nueva Orleans"
2,I wouldn't recommend it.,"As a fairly new clock collector I was looking for information to help me when purchasing clocks off of ebay. This was the first book I bought and I haven't looked at it since the day it came in the mail. I came across the Tran Duy Ly books shortly after this and purchased one, the one for Ingraham clocks and watches. I used this book constantly and have since purchased three more, (for Ansonia, Seth Thomas and New Haven). I pull them out every time I am interested in a clock. They are extremely thorough and accurate. Plus, you can get updates just for the prices, you don't have to buy a whole new book.This book is going to be one that stays on the bookshelf and will rarely, if ever, be referenced. Purchase the ones by Tran Duy Ly instead."
3,Identification Book on Clocks,"Price Guide to Antique Clocks by Robert and Harriett Swedberg contains information on the identification of American clocks from the mid-19th century until about 1940. There are more than 600 photographs with identifying information in this book. These are different photographs than were included in their 1989 book, ""American Clocks and Clockmakers"". While prices for the clocks were given, there was no information about whether these prices were retail or auction prices or how the prices were obtained."
3,difficult to flip pages. Very bulky,This product is very bulky which can be good and bad. If you want something that is more stable bulky may be good. Only good for larger books and it is very cumbersome to flip pages.
5,"Cool gizmo, lots of uses","I have a couple of these, and they are useful for kids' schoolbooks and reference material as well as for cookbooks in the kitchen. My only criticism is that particularly large, heavy books outweigh the cookbook holder, but it can be propped against the wall. It is reasonably priced and sturdy, and doesn't take up much space. Just right for me."
5,"Had it for years, wouldn't cook without it","I like this cookbook holder very much. I have had it for years. I read the other reviews. When cooking instructions come from a magazine or a one page recipe, i put another cookbook behind it to make it rigid. The only thing is when the recipe is in the front and continues to the other side of the page, or is over multiple pages like Julia Child's 'The way to cook', page-turning mid recipe can become a challenge. Sometimes my hands are totally in flour or what have you and I need to wash them to turn the page, which is harder since the cookbook holder holds the page. However, that would be true for any cookbook holder. I was looking a the more expensive cookbook holders and cannot see their big advantage. This is light, clear and easy to work with. I would buy it again and am getting one for my daughter for Christmas."
2,Broke too easily,"Had it for three months, and loved using it - when it fell, it shattered. If it had cost $2.99, I wouldn't complain, but for ten bucks I'd hope for plastic that would withstand some wear and tear."
3,not quite right,"Unfortunately this cookbook holder didn't work for me. The holder was too think to fit most of my large cookbooks comfortably. It was also not slanted back enough to read comfortably. There was often a glare on the surface and I had to stand almost eye level looking straight at it to read it.I think this might work better for people who use magazines or thinner cookbooks and maybe have higher counters. I did like that the shield covered most of the book for splatters and it was sturdy.Alas, I will have to keep looking for the perfect holder..."
3,Nor Pro cookbook holder,"Though it's a bit on the thin side, it's what I was looking for and couldn't find anywhere, but it took 11-12 days to get here. That's downright silly."
2,Get what you pay for.,This cookbook holder would be fine except that it doesn't lean the book back far enough to read it properly.
4,Second Chance,"This was not my first choice, however, my first choice fell apart so I ordered this one. I like it as itis one piece and fits well on my counter. Holds receipe book, cards or paper without problemsDelivered quickly"
1,Badly Designed Cookbook Holder,"Does not hold book at an angle for easy reading, so it's worthless. I plan on returning it if it's not too late."
2,Half a loaf not always better,"Lutoslawski's Paganini Variations is very engaging. His vocal music leaves me cold. His Symphony #3 is half annoying and half stunning. Why a talented composer writes a work in which the first section is intended to be unsatisfying--and obtains this result--is beyond me. The second section is stunning, but the composer simply wastes my time with the first section. Unfortunately, he does the same thing in several other of his so-called ""mature"" works. In sum, the ""mature"" Lutoslawski is not for me. Caveat Emptor!"
4,The right book to get facts and make the right choice,"I am a Plastic Surgeon from Guadalajara, Mexico. I had always follow Dr. Tebbetts trends in breast and Nose Surgery. This is a clear, well designed and presented book. Has everything, facts, for real, to take the decission to have breast augmentation. highly recommendended."
5,An truthful and informative book.,"After reading this book by Dr. Tebbets I became so comfortable with the idea of breast augmentation, and confiedent that Dr, Tebbets was the right doctor for me. I live near his practice in texas, and I met with him. He is an expert in his field, and I am very happy with my results."
5,EXCELLENT,This is the best book for information on breast augmentation! It is very comprehensive. Well worth my money!!!!!!
2,"Not the ""best"" book in my opinion!","I don't know about anyone else, but I got tired of feeling like they are speaking to me as if I'm a dumb blond. Page after page of exclamation points and bold, 30 pitch fonts drove me nuts!I received this book free because I had set up a consultation with their office (phone consult). I spoke with Terrye- who is not even a plastic surgeon , rather the wife of the plastic surgeon- who was very rude and snide.I think there are probably better books out there on the subject that will speak to you on an INTELLIGENT level and not assume that because you desire implants that you are some uneducated person who can't read and comprehend some medical terminology."
2,This Book is Biased,"I have been to two consultations with two different doctors fora breast augmentation and both doctors had nothing positive to sayabout this author or this book. I began reading the section on round vs. anatomical implants and noticed right away that there was a huge bias towards anatomical implants. I got suspicious and flipped to the back cover. There I learned that Dr. Tebbets was one of the designers of the anatomical implant. I also found out that he gets paid (the equivalent of a royality) each time a doctor uses an anatomical implant. Read this book with a grain of salt. Better yet, don't buy it. Save your money for your operation and check this book out at the library."
2,NOT THE BEST,"This book has a clear bias towards anatomical implants. Further, the font and formatting has bold and centered text throughout the book, which makes for difficult reading. Most of the information you can get for free from the web.Furthermore, don't expect to actually get surgery done by Dr. Tebbetts without suffering through his very rude wife, Terrye. She was, by far, the most condescending person I have spoken regarding surgery. Her response to questions was ""Can't you read. Everything you need to know is in the book.""Both the book and the office proved to be disappointing."
3,A1 MEDICAL INFO/ NOT FOR THE GIRL WHO WANTS BIG BREAST,"Some useful information, but for the most part, if you want full, breast c cup or larger, information is not useful. Dr. Tebbetts takes a very conservative point to breast augmentation, useing small implants and insisting on a NATURAL look. After photo's of his work are not impressive. I love the question portion of the book, it will help in choosing a surgeon, and other medical info is great, but as far as placement, size, and apperance, he leaves a lot to be desired. He also disagrees with the majority on most placement issues. If you have a tublar breast, or you are a AA cup, and desire on a B cup, it is worth the reading. If you desire a D cup, save your money for the consult."
4,Murder at the God's Gate,"You can almost feel like you're there in the heat of the Egyptian sun as it bakes into Thebes and with the dangers of court life. It was a wonderful trip into a time and place we can never go otherwise. I recommend it strongly. The plot is intricate, strong and solvable by those who look carefully."
2,disappointing second novel....,"this second novel in the Lord Meren Ancient Egyptian series, was not as good as the first. It took me a week to slog through this book, and towards the end I had to practically force myself to finish it. The storyline was much more ""court intrigue"" than mystery. The main problem was the author introduced so many new characters, that it was hard to tell which was which as well as taking away from the relationship between Lord Meren and his adopted son Kysen, which was the most enjoyable thing about book one.I'll still try the next book in the series as I've already invested so much in the series, but I wouldn't suggest this particular book as a stand alone.2 stars."
3,THIS BOOK IS ONLY FOR NOVICES,"I just got done reading this book. It is a very good ""broad"" overview of the world of miniature horses, but I am a little disappointed because on many of the aspects such as care, showing, conformation, etc. etc. the author instructs the reader to read ""other"" books that go into more detail. I feel that if you have never owned a horse before, and are interested in minis, it's a good book for you. But if you are like me, and already have knowledge of equine behavior, this may just be a simple review of what you already know. Definitly a good book for the novice, but the more experienced horse-person will not gain a whole lot."
5,The Minature Horse,"This little book has so much information on the minature horse, it is excellent reading, has been a great help to us, can recommend it."
1,very dissappointed and still waiting for my refund.,This product was sent to my sister for a gift. what was sent wasn't what was advertised. It was broken and in poor packaging. I will not buy from that merchandiser ever again.The worst service I have ever had on amazon.
3,Iluv wireless headphones,"You get a lot for your money here but if you own an iPhone, stay away! It will not pair with this phone."
1,utter waste of money,"Don't buy these headphones. The noise cancellation feature does absolutely nothing, the audio fidelity is mediocre, and the signalcuts out beyond 5 ft. On top of that managing the controls is awkward at best."
1,awful headphones,really really bad bass reproduction and lot of noise at the high end as well. Stay away from these!
1,waste of money,there is a big delay between the time the sound should be heard and the time that you actually here it. I'm out 100 bucks. Not even worth reselling because it's a piece of junk.
1,They eventually snap right above the earpiece,"I can't recommend these as they have a serious mechanical design flaw. After a few months my first pair snapped at the thin plastic where the headband connects to the earpiece. I sent them back to iLuv and they replaced them for free. The second pair broke just like the first. I was able to glue them back together but they just broke again. I'm now on my third pair, but this time I've glued some thick neoprene foam on the inside of the headband just above the earpieces so that it, not those thin plastic pieces, take the strain of the headband pushing inward. We'll see how long they last -- I don't hold out much hope.If they'd fix this flaw, it would be a reasonably nice product. There's some buzzing as others have noticed, but it's not too bad, and other than that the sound is pretty good. The freedom from wires is very handy."
3,One part out of two isn't that bad...I guess.,"I really like the headphones. They're comfortable and the sound is very good. My problem is with the transmitter, which has a battery time that is less than the amount of time it takes to charge it. It takes a couple of hours plus to charge the transmitter for only 90 or a 100 minutes of transmitting and the transmitter will not work while it is charging. If you're buying these for work don't expext a full day of listening unless you do what I did, which is buy a separate transmitter (from another company) that plugs in."
2,okay,"I rate the headphone 2 out of 5 because the plastic that goes over the head slip off frequently, you gatto have a big size head to make it stay. The turnable ear cups are too loose too, makes it unstable on ears.The sound is nice, but not the best. The bluetooth strength is a little weak, and I couldnt connect the little adapter after the phone; one is gonna disconnect another.Somewhat worth its price."
1,Not the best 'Best of',Gerry Marsden and his Pacemakers are great. I just want to point out that the double-CD 'Best of' Import has 15 extra tracks and sells for about the same price. There is just no reason to buy this compilation instead of the import.
5,"Excellent ""Rome""","""Rome"" is excellent televison...thank God for HBO and their series. From ""Oz"" to ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Wire"", Home Box Office has another winner. I'm glad this was renewed for another season, and hopefully it will not go the way of ""Carnivale"" which was also a wonderful show."
5,Wonderful. I recommend to everybody !!,"Bismillah, prayers, the Resurrection, why humanity and the universe were created, the Qur'an and modern thinking, Hadith, natural calamities, the Divine Being and His Attributes and acts, worldly life, Messengership, the Qur'an's references to scientific advances, Divine Unity, belief, and worship.The Qur'an's miraculousness, Divine Decree and Destiny and human free will, ijtihad, the Companions, the schools of law, Paradise and Hell, angels and jinn and other spirit beings, the world's destruction, the Resurrection, the human ego, particles, the Ascension, and God's Existence and Unity."
2,Didn't particularly like it,somewhat informative but the way they present the info is merely meant to entertain. I have seen most of the newton workshop videos and some we like some we don't. This we don't. I don't think presenting science in a way only to entertain really teaches kids anything but silliness and foolishness.
1,FAKE,This was a fake product!! So Upset with this people!! I bought to Brasil to a friend and we compare to the real one !!
2,ok,"After trailblazing through black metal, death metal, and viking metal, Bathory for the first time takes on an already established style - Pantera-style aggro metal. Unfortunately, Bathory doesn't get a good enough production job to pull it off. A weak drum sound and awkward sounding vocals just make this seem like a watered down version of Pantera. Quorthon can scream, and he's even proved that he can sing, but he's not too good at the hardcore-style shout. The underlying songs aren't too bad, but they just don't come across."
2,so-so,"in fact, this is the worst bathory album. it's kinda boring and annoying. sure, it has some cool songs, like born to die (very great).. but... only buy this if it's the last one to complete your bathory collection."
2,hmmm,"Well, this is probably the most unliked bathory album in forever. nobody likes it. personally, i think it's not bad , and not good. the production is not so bad as everyone says, but the songs are not well composed. it's kinda the same style. there is a very good song called born to die on it. but anyway, i like to listen to it."
3,good but....,"Overall I enjoyed the book but I also had a few problems with it. First, it was hard to read a book where everyone was so stuck in the past. I understood why Colin and Winnie would hold grudges but what was everyone elses problem? Maybe it's because I didn't grow up in a small town but I couldn't understand why anyone else would still have a problem with Sugar Beth. Especially the Seawillows, they were her partners in crime yet they don't seem to attach any blame to themselves! So she stopped hanging around them when she went off to college. Big deal! Why are they still hurt by that? Maybe if you grew up in a small town or community and you still live there this book would hit all the right notes. For me, there was a lot here I didn't get(I don't even remember who the rich b---ch in my high school was). I identified most with the character of Jewel who was the only one who seemed to be living in the present and not in the past."
3,An Entertaining Read,"Except for sex scenes dropped in randomly that totally didn't fit with the mood or the story, I really enjoyed the gritty characters and the fun banter. I had trouble mentally switching between imagining the southern belle accent and the English one. It was refreshing that the character was mature and not artificially immature and sweet but with plenty of baggage like we all are at 35. Despite many additions to my ""never write this in a book"" list I still liked it."
2,Could be better,"This is the first book I read of Susan Elizabeth Phillips: I bought it because the plot was very interesting. But the Truth I didn't liked it very much. I kept or reading the book, just hoping for it to get better.The only character that I liked was Gigi."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"This has been by far the most boring book I have ever read, it doesn't really talk about anything but sex.The author finds the way to talk about it in every way, if you are looking for an erotic novel this is the one, if not save your time for real literature!"
5,sassy and southern,"I thought I had read all of SEP's books, but somehow this one had slipped by. So glad I found it. I laughed out loud the whole way through. Love, love, love it!"
4,The past doesn't have to hurt.,(Edit)A great story of sometimes you past can come back to kick you in the butt. That doesn't mean you can't learn from it. I love Susan Elizabeth Phillips she is one of my all time faves. I read and reread 98% off all her books.
2,Ain't She Sappy...,"The first and last SEP book I will read. The humor was cliche, the ending was an unrealistic fairy tale and the novel was one step above a Harlequin romance novel. I am sure I winced a few times reading this book. I just kept hoping it would get better."
5,"I am picky, and this was one of my FAVORITES!","I have not had a ""new"" favorite book in a long time. I feel that I am pretty picky with what I read. However, I could not stop reading this book (and at the same time, did not want it to end!)I laughed so much. I even cried a couple of times. I fell in love with all of the characters.It is a truly MUST read!"
4,"Ain't She Sweet pulls you in, won't let you go","4.5 stars actually. This is my first book by this author. I'm having a hard time describing this book. I thought she wrote romantic comedy, but I didn't find it particularly funny, not like Jennifer Crusie can be. It is a romance, but it's also more, and it's heavier than what I'd expect romantic comedy to be. It's painful and then hopeful.When I first started reading this book, I didn't think I was going to like it. But I did. But I don't think I can read it cover to cover again. I just feel the pain of some of the characters too much.Unlike many other books I've read lately, I couldn't put this one down until I was over half way into it. And I ended up finishing it in one night and part of the next day. And I wish I hadn't finished it. I was enjoying the last part so much. And even though I feel sad that it's over, I still can't re-read it."
4,Big surprise!,"I wasn't going to read this book. I like SEP, but sometimes she gets a little too quirky for me, and I was sure that was going to be the case with Ain't She Sweet. I got it used for a couple of dollars and immediately groaned at the description of the hero. The initial description of Colin as a skinny schoolteacher with a huge nose and an affinity for poetry sounded totally opposite of what we've come to expect from our heroes. Still, the storyline drew me in immediately, and I was already laughing reading the first page. I actually ended up LOVING this story. I laughed so hard and even fell a little in love with Colin, even though he's English, which doesn't appeal to me. This one is definitely a keeper, just quirky enough to make you laugh, but heartbreakingly sweet at the same time. Give it a try."
5,SEP is a master storyteller...,"Having read just about every book published by Susan Elizabeth Phillips, I couldn't wait to get my hands on her newest offering, AIN'T SHE SWEET. I must admit I was expecting more of a light-hearted comedy reminiscent of the humor found in her ""Chicago Stars"" books. But what I did find was a powerful redemption tale that dealt with the darker side of the human psyche. The book brought to mind another ""redemption tale"" of SEP's, DREAM A LITTLE DREAM. Like many readers who start out reading AIN'T SHE SWEET, I had the idea in the back of my mind that the book's heroine was way past deserving forgiveness and thought to myself, ""Ms. Phillips, there's no way you are going to make me like Sugar Beth!"". However, in the SEP's world no character is beyond hope and by the end of the book, I found myself truly fulfilled to learn that bad starts can lead to happy endings and that bad girls can do good."
5,The BEST,"I do have all the books by Mrs. Phillips and so far I think this is the BEST! I didnt like ""Breathing Room"" too much and was apprehensive about the new one. But WOW! what a surprise! You will NOT be dissapointed!I couldn`t put it down! You just got to love the characters and the dialogue between Colin and Sugar Beth... PRICELESS!I did Not want it to end, the waiting time for Mrs. Phillips new book is going to be very loooong!"
5,A Honey of a Story!,"This is the first time I've encountered Susan Elizabeth Phillips. I picked up the audio book at the library. I was hooked within the first 3 minutes. Honey Beth is everyone's high school nightmare... rich, popular, blond and perfect. I loved her sense of humor and unbreakable spirit. Her interactions with Colin were a hoot. The only thing I have negative to say about the audio version is the narrators awful British accent. I kept picturing Hugh Grant's voice... much more appropriate. I usually listen to books on cd on my way to work and on road trips. I took this one inside and listened to it for two days until I devoured all 11 hours. I found myself laughing out loud and mumbling to myself like a nut. So if you're looking for something entertaining especially for a long commute this is a good pick!"
5,Ain't She Sweet?,"Susan Elizabeth Phillips is the master of the heroine who has her back to the wall, but ain't dead yet attitude. Sugar Beth Carey is exactly an SEP heroine in the footsteps of Rachel Stone from DREAM A LITTLE DREAM. She may be down & out but she's not giving up or giving in until she succeeds at what she's set out to do. We all did things in our youth that we regret as we grow up and mature. Sugar Beth grew up well-to-do and then went on to the ""School of Hard Knocks,"" doing more growing up there than she ever did in her teens. Colin is the perfect match for her and her relationship with Winnie gives everyone hope of reconcilation. A very good read."
4,Ain't She Sweet,"In high school, Sugar Beth made many enemies. When she left town for college and deserted her ""Seawillows"" she made more. Now, she has come home broke and desperate, but to get what she is after, she will have to repent for her sins. This was a real catchy book. The characters were awesome and Sugar Beth was hilarious. I found my self laughing out loud several times. This is not your every day romance novel and I would definitely recommend it!"
5,Another Winner,"Ms. Susan Elizabeth Phillip scores again. The tale is such so whimsical, unbelievably funny, and improbable that I couldn't help but keep turning the pages long into the night. I loved it! The main characters are multi-faceted, so that one truly gets to know them. I enjoy some lighthearted reading in between some of the deeper tomes I usually indulge in, so this story was truly a breath of clean air which fit that bill. Ms. Phillips is a treasure. She has great insight into understanding human frailty and emotions, thus does a great job of rationalizing and explaining Sugar Beth's self-centered persona in her younger days. Additionally, Ms. Phillips knows exactly how to redeem those same personality flaws in her characters, in this case giving us a great heroine in Ms. Sugar Beth. Kudos to you Ms. Phillips!"
4,A good time,"I enjoyed this book. I liked the two twists Ms. Phillips inserted early in the story: Who Winnie was married to, and then Winnie's relationship to Sugar Beth. The dialogue was wonderfully witty.But the story wasn't without its flaws. I simply didn't feel Sugar Beth's devotion to her elderly deceased husband, or to his mentally impaired daughter. Maybe because this happened in the past and the author didn't paint a visual picture. It was the one hole in an otherwise extremely well developed character. Nor could I understand the Seawillows. I don't see where Sugar Beth did anything for them to hate her so much, other than leave town and lose touch. Winnie was the only one who had a right to hold a grudge.But flaws aside, this was a great story of loss and redemption."
1,High school all over again....,"This book was dumb. Basically messed-up people have to get over their high-school issues 15 odd years later. No one was likable - neither the ""hero"" or ""heroine"" (I hate to even use those words) -- nor the background characters. I recall Breathing Room and a few of her others being so much better."
2,Not up to her usual standards,"Last SEP book I'll buy, they just keep getting worse. Her earlier books were much better, now she is just recycling parts of other stories."
2,Not as good as her others,"I was really disappointed in this book. Sugar Beth wasn't very likable and I didn't really care for Colin, either. Their romance fell flat. I was more interested in Winnie and Ryan's love life then the main characters! I will say the dialogue was very good though. Nice and snappy at times."
5,NO PUPPETS,"I purchased this item because the review told me there were none of the puppets. My two year old granddaughter wants Caillou every night and just loves him! I would recommend this DVD and also C's Playschool Adventures, C the Creative, and C's Family Favorites, as there are no puppets."
2,"Not much to ""Touch and Feel""","If you are looking for a book to offer your child textures to feel, this is probably not the best book for you. The book is actually more about animals than a garden and the textures are very small. The colorful pictures are nice."
1,Delay in the shipping when it is coming to Canada,I'am very dissapointed with the shipping service.My product was shipped on Jun-15-2008 but until now Jul-10-2008 I didn't receive it.
5,"2 Great reads, very steamy.","These secrets books are a great way to find new authors. After reading these short but very steamy stories I want to find more from them. Roarke's prisoner (Angela Knight) was my favorite out of the four, with Snowbound (Bonnie Hamre) coming a close second. This series is turning into a very enjoyable read & i'm looking forward to the rest."
2,disappointed with the collection overall,"I thought the four stories were too different in style to fit together well. I assumed incorrectly that because Angela Knight's story was futuristic that all the others would be too. I would not have purchased it had I known two were historicals and one a contemporary with nothing in common.I was disappointed with this collection. Angela Knight's story, Roarke's Prisoner, stood out and was worth a second read--and almost made the cost worthwhile by itself. I was disappointed with the rest. They all needed more development to make me believe in the sudden relationships between strangers, especially the historicals.I often keep books for a second read before trading them in. Not so for this one--right into my trade-in pile."
4,note repeat title,"There is a great Donner song here, properly titled ""(What A Sad Way) To Love Someone"" that is included twice & mistitled both times once as ""(What A Sad Way) To Love Somebody"" and as ""To Love"". Maybe one's stereo & one mono? - or maybe not. ""I Got Burned"" is conspicuous in its absence here, on 33 hits, & on the $100 CD set. I'm glad I've got it on 45 :)"
4,Very listenable Elvis-like sounding CD from the 60s - Ral Donner,"Ral Donner was a singer who sounded very much like Elvis in the 60s. The tunes on this CD contain the best of his work and they hold up very well today. If you like Elvis's voice, you'll enjoy Ral Donner."
5,Beware of Lying Reviewers & Bad spelers,"Elvis Presley's mother did NOT catch him recording Ral Donner's music; she was in fact dead when Ral (true name Ralph) came along. (Typical of that reviewer). Ral did NOT precede Elvis; in fact, he was born in Chicago seven years after Elvis. He was very good in his vocal impersonation and even did Elvis' speaking voice for narrating the semi-documentaty movie ""This is Elvis"". His charted hits are on this package; I recommend it. Mister Donner died of cancer in 1984; cherish the memory--unless you just discovered him."
3,a childhood memory,"I order this DVD because I remember seeing it as a child. It is a good, moral story that is not a cinematic masterpiece, but entertaining nonetheless!"
5,"good memories, good movie!","I grew up watching The Buttercream Gang. My siblings and I watched the VHS tape about a hundred thousand times. So naturally, when I found it here on DVD I was ecstatic. Great quality. Can't believe it is on DVD. Not only do I recommend this seller, but if you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor and check it out. Young or old, it reminds us that we can all use a little cheesy, heartwarming storyline in our worldly, overstimulated lives!"
5,Wonderful!!!,"My kids love Mr. Henry!!! If you want your kids to have a deeper understanding of the Bible and have fun at the same time then buy this product. This is unlike any other childrens Bible story/education program. Although my kids have heard most of these bible stories, Mr. Henry helps them to experience them. They beg to hear Mr. Henry tell them ""just one more."" Mr. Henry (Frank Peretti) does such an amazing job making the stories come alive. He helps the kids comprehend God's Word. I am so thankful for these audio cds."
3,This movie sucks and had a good story line,Darn!!!! The acting by the lead charter was well it stank. But the story line was well written. I must admit that I have seen some of his later work and it was a lot better. I give everyone an fair shake and this movie needs to be remade. Who ever wrote this movie needs to have their hand shaken. A.L. Scott
2,Far-out silly...,"I read the info on it before I bought, was disappointed. Want my money back....lol."
1,The Worst Movie Ever. Really.,"This is the worst movie ever made. I am serious, no joke here. I watched the whole thing just to make sure."
4,OOOH-OOOH-OOOOH-OOOOH,"GREAT L.A. DOO-WOP FROM THE 1950'S THE ONLY ARTISTS I HAD EVER HEARD BEFORE WERE BOBBY DAY AND THE SATELLITES (LITTLE BITTY PRETTY ONE, ROCKIN' ROBIN) AND RICHARD BERRY (WHO WROTE AND DID THE ORIGINAL RECORDING OF LOUIE, LOUIE, WHICH IS NOT ON THIS CD). GREAT VOCAL HARMONIES IF YOU LIKE DOO-WOP YOU WILL ENJOY THIS."
1,"this dvd is the same as ""Sympathy for the Devil""","The same company selling this dvd, has just re-released it with a newer picture on the cover as ""sympathy for the devil"" in an attempt to sell the same thing again to fans. its a weak documentary in the first place, and the fact that the company is trying to rip-off fans by re-naming this is further proof of their intentions.neither dvd is worth it, and Amazon should note on each page these 2 dvds are exactly the same or they will be dealing with alot of returns."
1,Dear Amazon,"Company is producing a poor portrait of a worthless doppleganger. please take this off of your listings and fans beware. ($) kill your god, kill this company."
1,sad that there are not all the song of the films,I bought this to be able to enjoy more the music and songs of the film...but no lots of the songs were missing and i could not find the ones i enjoyed during the movie. If you are looking for the love songs...they are not there...I m even planning to sell it back on amazon...or ebay.
3,Cheaply made but Ok,It's kind of cheaply made and seemed a little expensive for $6 but it does the job.
4,"Good price, pretty good product","Given the price, this product is pretty good. It appeared nicer in the photos, but it was pretty cheap and my friend uses it a lot. He says that it's really useful, especially at parties."
4,Trusty jigger,"Not much to say, this is a nice jigger. It was the only jigger I could find that was 2oz + 1oz, and those sizes make it quite versatile for making all kinds of drinks. I have not had it very long but it has held up well so far."
4,Handy,I use this once after I got it. It was really handy. So helpful especially for those who like mix drinks and thinking about making it at home.
3,Ehhhhh...,"Somewhat poor quality. Not the greatest. Also was expecting four Jiggers, not just one. I guess that's my fault, as the title says ""Jigger"" and not ""Jiggers.""Could take a different picture... Either way, I'm buying a new one from a different company, of higher quality."
3,"Jigger, Made in India",I bought this for my brother-in-law for Christmas. It is made in India. It is functional and has a low luster for Stainless Steel. I wish it was made in the U.S.A.
5,Only received one jigger instead of three,Everything else was good (gift to my son) but only one stainless jigger arrived instead of two.
4,Jigger,I bought this jigger because I like the wide mouth on it which prevents spilling liquor as you pour it in. No line to indicate where the 1 or 2 oz level is so I am not sure if you are supposed to fill it to the top or not. I like to make a variety of cocktails and the portions seem to be coming out OK.
5,Great Jigger,"The Jigger is exactly as described. It is an hour-glass shape with a 2oz shot on one side and a 1oz shot on the other (I actually measured and it is spot on). It is reasonably priced and durable. It is very functional, easy to clean and a throw back to what my grandparents would use. Have fun."
1,producers envy,Program dismissed the actors and Roddenberry as insignificant. The assumed audience of the series was considered air heads. There was no mention that the series was moved to a dead air late Friday night spot.
5,An aussie classic featuring young Nicole Kidman,Take a rare look at young Nicole in this Australian action adventure. This was one of my favorites growing up. I'm sure my brothers and I watched it 100 times. Who knew that this dainty ex-wife of Tom Cruise was such a tough young thing. Check out some of her moves on the bike!
5,GREAT DOO-WOP,"This is a GEM of a Doo-Wop cd. It contains 15 unheralded songs ranging from great ballads to excellent uptempo tunes. The groups are : The Harptones, The Eternals, Dean Barlow + Group, The Genies, The Fashions, The Mello-Harps, The Distants, The 4 Winds, The Tokens + The Inspirations. You've probably never heard of most of these songs but you'll be glad you got this cd !!"
2,theres better curry paste out there,"this paste is actually what first got me into thai curry, at the time i loved it, made it all the time, then i discovered a better brand of curry paste, hand brand curry paste, premium stuff, amazon doesn't sell :(, hint to amazon, stock it, but you can get it at [...], its based in seattle and they import everything from thailand, the flavor of hands brand is so much better the mae ploy, a huge difference, i went back to mae ploy after having hand brand and i didnt even finish my meal, very bland, boring by comparison, also as a side note, these are very small containers, i was used to buy the large ones at my local asian store, these are like 1/4 the size of those ones. not a good deal if you can find it locally."
1,This book is hitting the Trash!,My daughter got this book for Christmas. We read it once and it is now in the trash. I cannot read such rubbish to my child. The father duck sends the little duck away for not meeting his standards. It is only once the duck accidently fits the mold that he is allowed back into the family. It also uses another animal/group (the chickens) as a means of degrading the duck.
1,Not my Amsterdam!,"I've been to Amsterdam and it's a beautiful city. Unfortunately, this item doesn't show the beauty of the place. You'll like it if you're gay, smoke pot, and like staying in flop houses."
1,Beware of Amsterdam,"The film spends about 60% of the film on the gay scene, in fact it says that 40% of the center is not straight, lousy cafe service, crumby markets, raw herring, not sushi, just raw herring deboned and swallowed slime and all, and bycicles and bycicles, and rows and rows of boring looking flats along canals, no wonder the drugs are legal, one probalby needs that to keep from going bonkers, I had planned a trip to Amsterdam based on internet data, but nothing showed all this, I'm from New York this place looks dinky from this film. I want to thank the film makers for saving me a ton of dough,if you want astoner trip go to Morroco,or Turkey or MoBay Jamaica."
5,It is helpful,"I like it and I love it. Very helpful book to begin with Adobe Photoshop 7I hope the author will continue to write about CS 3,4,5 and 6 books"
2,a decent book but not for a real beginner.......,"It did cover the basics but the way the book is organised did not work well for me. One need to know VB.Net and C# on a intermediate level and some XML and SQL knowledge to appreciate this book. It seems to foucs how to use visual studio .net for XML and database, rather than understaning VS.net inline with C# and VB.net ,more details and explanation of VS.net features with relevance to OO concepts like inheritance, encapulation, interface,etc; which i felt would be more effective for one to understand visual studio .net better and its proper usage during window form programming.Not really for someone needing a better understanding of VISUAL STUDIO .NET with relevance to C# or VB.NET !!!"
1,"Regrettably, it sucks.","I did not read the reviews before I bought this book on a friend's recommendation. I made a big mistake. The critics are right on target. This book needs major editing before it will be an aid to anyone. And while I've marked mine up and cannot therefore recover my $30, maybe I can save you yours.Maybe if sales of this book die as a result of the reviews these publishers will think twice before rushing out so flawed a product. They should truly be embarrassed."
2,"full of errors, theory is pretty good though","Although to me some of the errors were obvious but for a beginner they might not be that obvious and you could get stuck with an error screen for hours and hours thinking YOU are wrong and the book is right, before finally discovering you need to adjust cause the book is just wrong.they add four menu items for example, while in the image you see it are five. then in the code they work with five so you have to make the fifth one yourself and discover its name etc. Also they tell you to rename the buttons but in their code you can't follow anymore cause they didnt rename their own buttons.This was just in chapter 1, the third day, which is the first real code writing lesson.I can't understand why someone would give this book a five star rating. It's very confusing for a beginner with all the errors. But if you have a decent basis and you can easily discover the errors it might still be ok, but not highly recommended."
1,TRASH!!!,"I bought this book a while ago but I am now just going through it for my new job. I am about 2/3 of the way thru and while it does have some good information, the code samples are complete and utter TRASH!! My god if one simple application of his actually worked without hours of figuring out what HE DID WRONG I would believe Bush is an intelligent man. Stay away from this garbage -- the authors website doesn't work either so basically you're screwed."
2,Cannot recommend this book,"Unfortunately, the code examples in this book are fraught with careless errors. What's the point of picking up a book to learn VS .Net if the code examples don't work? Moreover, the author's claim (p.3) of a website featuring code samples, fixes, and other helpful materials to supplement the book is simply untrue. That website (http://www.vbasp.net) exists, but has nothing uploaded. I wasted many hours trying to get code examples to work before learning through Amazon.com Reviews that others have had the same problem. How disappointing."
1,Waste of money,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this book has a lot of mistakes in it. How sloppy does an author/publisher have to be to put out a beginner's book where many of the examples don't work? It's a lot easier and more effective to learn this material by using the documentation that comes with Visual Studio."
2,Could be good... but,Could be good... but WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY too many typos that will make you spend hours trying to figure out if you've done something wrong or if it's just another typo in the book text.
1,Not ready for prime time,"The layout and content of the book are excellent, but the utility to someone trying to ""Teach Yourself Visual Studio"" is severely hampered by excessive errors in the text and samples. Publishing this book in its current state is the equivalent of implementing an application as soon as it successfully compiles. Both are not a good idea."
2,Did anyone proof this book?,"Far too many errors, typo's and omissions fora self-help book. While it's an OK walk thru of.Net IDE features, the sample code is buggy andit's hard to get any speed when you have tofigure out what the author left out."
2,A frustrated programmer,"I thought I would be spending 21 days learning Visual Studio .NET, instead I have been spending much of the time working around bugs in the code examples. All of the code listings are suppose to have both VB.NET and C# listings. In one case there was no C# listing and converting the VB.NET code to C# was not easy. In another case an error in both the VB.NET and C# listing resulted in a form that had bogus data displayed and this form was shown in the book! This book is not for the beginner. It assumes you have a basic knowledge of SQL Server and XML. It lacks organization. Very poorly proofread."
4,Where's the errata?,"The author claims in this book's introduction that ""My own web site will have the code samples, fixes, errors and omissions, additional stuff I forgot about, and other goodies for this book... As of April 9, 2003 that web site appears to have never been online. If you need the code samples, you may want to wait until that website is online before you consider buying this book.May 15, 2003 update: Jason Beres reports that the code samples are available on the Publisher's site... Apparently the related ""fixes, errors, omissions, and additional stuff"" were a casualty of a crashed server and are being redeveloped.The book is definitely helpful. I recommend it."
1,Nitrous information lacking,I bought the book to do a paper on nitrous oxide racing in motorcycles. The nitrous chapter was very small and seemed to refer to one company too much. The other two chapters were much better. Why did the author not cover nitrous and turbos or superchargers?
3,Following his advice cost me thousands of dollars of pain,"I followed Joe Haile's advice but the vendors he recommended to me took my money and after many years of holding (and misusing) my motorcycle and money they did not deliver the goods and services they promised. I had to sue the listed vendors Luftmeister, RB Racing, Matt Capri, & Bob Behn for fraud and it cost me thousands of dollars and my motorcycle does not run right after many years of their supposed help. I bought this book and called Joe Haile many times and his advice cost me thousands of dollars of pain."
2,Will not read flash cards greater than 1 GB,"Well, I liked it until I tried to download my pictures from a 2 GB SD card on the built in card reader. It thinks it is unformatted. Technical support says it will not read a card over 1 GB. This is a new computer. What did they think no one was going to buy a larger card?"
3,"OK, not the best out there",These mats are good if you are looking for a good deal. I think the Classy Kid Coloring Toppers are much better because they have a sticky strip on all 4 sides vs. 2 for the Neat Solutions mats.
2,not new package,"I thought I was buying a new product, although the placemats were unused, there was no original packaging, they were placed in an ordinary zip lock bag.. this was embarassing to give as a gift, especially in view of the price! I was dissappointed."
4,"Good product, want variety",I really like these table top covers. They have stayed in place and are great for knowing that the surface my son is eating off of is clean. Mine also had sticky on all 4 sides which other reviewers have said theirs did not. One hit I have is to put the bottom one under the table so it is harder for your child to pick it off:).I was very disappointed that all 50 place mats in this pack were the same design. I would have really enjoyed some variety. Lucky for me my son is too young to know that all of his place mats have the same searching game.
4,Useful even if not perfect,"I received two different designs & the version with adhesive on all four sides. I (& my kids) like the designs the characters are featured prominently & the colors are very bright. One design has a picture search that is pretty much pointless, it's so easy that my 9mth old can point them out when asked. But still both designs keep them entertained, 9mth old batting at the characters & 3yr old makes up stories about what they're doing, while giving them a clean eating space. My major compliant is the adhesive seems to be weaker on these 4 sided designs then the 2 sided ones I had before. Even my 3yr old had to work at getting the two sided ones up but these undo at the slightest provocation."
5,Great for going out or travel!,"These are very compact and lightweight to stick in the diaper bag and travel with. They stick easily to any restaurant table we've tried, and stay put pretty well. They have a sticky strip all the way along the top and bottom edges, stay put, yet come up easily to dispose of. My son isn't trustworthy with plates yet, so it's nice to know I'm putting his food down on something clean, not just the wiped-down-with-water table."
2,Disappointed with the photo here,"The quality of the product is great and it stays on properly. However, I'm giving 2 stars as I expected to receive various design of Winnie the Pooh like the photo shown but ending up getting one design for all 50 counts."
3,"Great item, okay graphics",I love table toppers and have used them with 2 kids. The graphic on this one is just okay. I prefer ones that have lots of letters and numbers or the Dora ones with many objects in 2 languages. It makes waiting for meals more of an opportunity for learning. These are just fun with the characters on them. Better for babies that aren't up to the letter learning yet.
2,poor construction,"this doghouse, was cute, unfortunately, the construction was poor, poor panel fit, and wood quality was not good, i do not recommend it."
1,DISAPPOINTING,As a huge admirer of Profofiev's early demonic piano pieces I bought this album mainly because it included all of them - starting with everyone's favorite Toccata Op.11. And immediately knew this pianist and the mushy sound she prefers was never going to compete with other Prokofiev CD's I already own. The best by far in terms of both staccato and sensitive finger work being a Melodiya 1970 ADD recording (reissued by BMG on CD) played by a young Russian virtuoso Yekaterina Novitskaya. Boris Berman also has Prokofiev running in his veins. The only problem being Chandos used absolutely no thematic logic when putting together his 9-album complete Prokofiev piano music set. Making finding and playing his piano output in the order it was composed an unnecessarily tortuous exercise.
3,Works well but is incredibly expensive,"This attachment works well. Just make sure that the grinding stone is exactly true. In other words, dress the stone using the diamond truing tool before using this jig. Planer and jointer knives always seemed to get knicks long before the blades become dull. With this attachment, it's easy to quickly clean up those knicks. But it is very expensive. Tormek could have earned a satisfied customer for life (me) if they charged a price that was reasonably related to the manufacturing cost of this item. Instead, I'll just write this not-so-positive review.26OCT2005 Today the price was $90. I paid $140 for mine. At $90 this is more reasonable."
2,Mini indeed,"I am a fan of this series in the regular size, but I was disappointed in the mini size. The font is very small. Only 28 pages. Not worth $10 in my opinion."
3,Same over and over - not enough How To,"Her top 10 decorating mistakes in the first chapter are good info. But then the rest of the chapters are about different clients and their makeovers. Too much time is spent describing the room (this lamp here, this picture there) both before and after....and not enough description of HOW she knew to put what where to make them better. The before and afters are dramatic, and it's amazing what can be done with what one already has. But she doesn't impart enough direction to the reader on how to know what would go good where."
3,Not My Favorite Lauri Ward Book,"I own Lauri's two other books and am a big fan of ""Use What You Have"" decorating. The things that I did not like about her latest book, ""Home Therapy,"" for one, are the use of black and white photographs in her ""before"" pictures. It was really hard to see the details in these shots. Second was the use of too much description. (I know what you're thinking-how could there be too much description?)Lauri goes into lots of details about the clients' rooms and I found myself flipping the pages back and forth to try to see everything she was pointing out. Very confusing. If I were going to recommend one of Lauri's books it would definitely be her first one.(""Use What You Have Decorating."")I love it and have bought it for friends."
2,Not as good as as her first book,"I did not like the layout of this book at all--particularly annoying was the fact that you had to turn pages between the ""before"" and ""after"" room drawing layouts-they should have been either put on facing pages or on the same page.Also, her first book worked well because it seemed to focus more on average people with decorating issues, this book was definitely skewed towards people with scads of money like the people with the view home in Laguna Beach, who practically had walls made of windows--hardly what the average person is looking to showcase!I would borrow this one from the library, but buy her first book."
4,Finally a new book by Lauri Ward,"I have been looking forward to Lauri Ward's newest book. I am a huge fan of her first book, ""Use What You Have"". I have noticed that the pictures in that first book were beginning to look dated. This book, Home Therapy, shows many great up-to-date photos and explanations of the ""whys"" of the arrangement steps. The only small flaw is that the book shows several ""after"" rooms with a rug angled out into the room rather than the rug following the lines of the furniture arrangement. As a decorator myself, I do not care for that technique. Otherwise, Home Therapy is a great addition to your collection of decorating books."
2,Misses the Mark Totally,"It's disappointing when the all important concepts of scale and proportion aren't discussed, terms missing in her previous books as well. How can arrangement design be effective without an understanding of scale and proportion?Art is hung too high over the sofas in many cases drawing the eye to the space between the art and the top of the sofa; art overpowers the furniture below it in many of the rooms giving an oppressive feeling; the size and format of the art is not considered in scale to other pieces in a grouping; nor is much thought given to format and proportions.Buyer beware."
1,A waste of money,"This is a horrible book. I have Use What You Have Decorating, which is a very good book. This book shows a black and white before picture with an endless list of every piece of furniture, pictures, etc. and where they are located in the room, followed by a color after picture with an endless list of where every piece of furniture, pictures, etc. are located. After reading this same format in each chapter (over and over again) for each of her customers, and not being able to relate any of this to my own home and with little or no explanation of why she changed what she did, I dumped this book in a box of books to give away. Don't waste your money. There are lots of better books out there."
5,So much FUN!,"Once again, the Unstable Fables deliver another funny and fun cartoon. This one had plenty of cameos from the other Unstable Fable stories and that was fun to see. Using the old disco classic, We Are Family is a great message that all the Unstable Fable DVDs share. The power of family is a great underlying message in an otherwise full of laughs, well told story."
4,Sounds good and Patton always does!,"The only thing that is missing is LOMBARDO... which is kind of a biggy, but the Melvins man fills in fairly enough, if not just as well, but.... Neil Hamburger never disappoints...even when he tries really hard. Was a nice Christmas present to myself. Thanks me."
5,BEST LIVE DVD EVER!!,"Hands down the best live dvd ever made. Just for the fact that, no matter how hard you try, a live dvd CAN'T take you there. If you weren't there you missed it. A video is just a very sub par way to experience a live concert. Without the feel of the sound and the energy of the band and crowd, it really falls flat. THIS DVD however, is not trying to recreate a live show but turn it into something completely different. Lots of fun effects and it's a real artistic take on the entire show. At this price it's worth buying even if you have never heard the music. Just for the experience."
2,don't buy this -,"unless you have a particular interest in the writing of Cecil Gould. Buy the new book on Parmigianino's Paintings by Mary Vaccaro instead (the compliment to her book on the drawings). The reproductions in that book are ten times better than in this one - all colour, superb full page details, full range of paintings (some now cleaned and restored). And it's cheaper. No contest."
3,A pretty good book,"I read this book hoping to learn more about Parmigianino's life than I already knew (from Vasari's Lives of the Artist). Unfortunately, this book doesn't offer much more. This book addresses the chronology of his paintings (within a summary of his life), and relates his paintings to each other, and to other works of art. It includes most of his paintings (I don't think it includes all of them), but some of them are not in color."
5,A great read,"Not a big enthusiast of the Napoleonic war, I was still compelled to read this book, being one who enjoys to read such first-person accounts. I have to say, it was very much worth it. Indeed, it is a short book, and therefore a quick read; but it is infused with a wealth of information about the life of a soldier of this era. The prose is clean and clear, and like the previous reviewer states, in no way marred by the agenda of the more scholarly memoirist. I highly recommend this book."
5,A Rare Primary Source,"It has a wonderful way of following along with his travels and he does not withhold details that are gruesome or terrible. He even attempts to describe the terrors and misfortunes of being a soldier to his readers. At a certain point in the writing it is as if he has decided that this is a book that will be read for years to come. Beaten, starved, and cold he continues on his journey through his experiences of a terrible war that was not seen through Napoleon's eyes."
4,"Quick read, interesting, worthwhile","This is what it is. Not profound or hugely insightful, but if you are interested in these wars, or reading natural accounts or letters of times past, this was a quick read full of pathos but not bathos, and a reminder of just how lucky we have it. His description of trying to get over the last bridge, among a sea of people and cannon fire, taking 4 hours, is amazing. He was a lucky man, and it is clear he knew it."
1,this book is REALLY BAD!!!,This book will have you lost in a mattter of no time. I found it so borng with no insentive to have you keep reading it . It was just really really bad.
3,"Look gorgeous, but...","I bought this case as I love the pink color, and I really love the apprearance. The materials used are A grade. However, when used with my Motorola A1200 MNG, my phone does not response properly as usual -- when there's incoming call, the phone will vibrate longer than normal with delayed in ringtone, and I'll have to wait for a while before I can start talking on the phone (because the vibration does not stop and I cannot hear the voice of the caller unless the vibration would stop and the ring would start.) I don't know if this happen to other phone models. I still keep it for my keys instead !"
1,Beyond lame,"Dr. Lightman, the hero of this book, is faced with having to create a cure for a newly emergent strain of the flu that's certain to wipe out the world. That's great and all, but he's got absolutely no personality to speak of, and is such a spineless push-over, that it's impossible to get behind this man and his cause. That makes the rest of the book as ineffective as he is, even when the supporting cast is fairly interesting. Skip this one."
2,Losing my religion.....,"As a DT-fan from the start, I think the new album disappoints. When you scan the intro's it's quite promesing, but in some tracks it evolves in an incomprhensible mess of sounds. Craftsmanship of the individual players is undoubted. But it takes more than that to make a unity. I adore most of their albums, but this one I dislike. Music is supposed to be a bearer of a message. Well, this message is too far hidden and the music just as vague. Sorry guys, please order ""Scenes from a Memory"" or ""Octavarium"" but not this one.....I wish DT got back on writing real theme-albums, or at least songs with the deep and uplifting lyrics as they usually did. Do not try to copy Metallica, nor any other band... which in some instances can be heard on Systematic Chaos.Greetz from a disappointed Dutchman."
3,Not quite inspiring,"I love Dream Theater. I own all their albums and DVD's. I'm sorry to say but I believe Systematic Chaos is a filler album, put together in a hurry in order to have something to sell. I have heard it several times and have found in it no really memorable songs or melodies. It certainly has its good parts (it is still DT after all), but not what you'd expect from this band. There is just too much improvising and too little filtering; it seems everything they recorded ended up in this album. I think Octavarium was much better. Also, I thought the political lyrics were heavy-handed and too Hollywoodesque for what has been called ""thinking man's metal."""
2,"I like Dream Theater, but . . .","This album is lame. Seriously. I'd honestly only put Falling Into Infinity below it. I like DT quite a bit, but no matter hhow hard I try to like it, Systematic Chaos comes off as nothing more than musical masturbation. They're ripping themselves off at this point. Listen to ""Sacrificed Sons"" and then listen to ""In the Presence of Enemies, Pt. 2"" and one of the key themes is almost identical. They've been and can be much better."
3,Chaos Allright.......,"Nothing groundbreaking here....""Systematic Chaos"" sounds like a rushed production. The usuall excellent musicianship is still present, but there are NO memorable songs. JP is fast,but offers none of his trademark melodic solos. DT still has yet to produce the quality and intensity of ""Scenes From a Memory"" with their last few outings. Production is excellent , though."
3,Jump the shark?,"Well, having been a fan of DT sinceAwake, I must say that this album is a huge disappointment. DT reached their zenith withMetropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory. I've gotten used to most everything they doing seeming fairly average since then. This album, on the other hand, is half noise and half interesting but unrelated tracks. They demonstrated their ability to do a fairly pure heavy album withTrain of Thought, which was a pretty good album. I'm not sure what they're trying to prove with this album. I would not be surprised to see James and/or Jordan leave prior to the next album, and I think we'll look back at DT in 10 years and identify this album as the point in time where they jumped the shark."
1,What Happened?,"Basically you can sum up DT's career in 2 phases., pre and post Scenes From a Memory... It seemed like right after Metropolis 2 DT became heavier and heavier and seemed to lose their happiness.. Every album since this has less and less 'pep' and 'bounciness'... yet I keep buying their albums hoping that they will reinvent themselves again... gone are the days of the DT tight guitars (listen to this album compared to LTE 2 and Awake and you will know what I mean), great hooks, and even any recognizable song structure....I have listened to this album about 4x since I purchased it, and it just doesn't get me feeling as I did way back in the day.. I actually figured it out., somehow it sounds like Lamb of God w/ keyboards and someone that sings...I'm sorry DT, I had such high hopes."
2,Stop writing lryics... please!,"I simply don't have the ears for these lyrics. I would have been happy if this was just an instrumental album. I really respect the band, musicianship and all the hard work. I've got absolutely no memorable moments listening to this album. Nothing stands out or grabs my attention other then how sick I am of listening to religious lyrical content. Instead of Parental Warnings there should be one for explicit use of religious undertones (whether you're singing about your own, or someone else's). I started having flash backs of the ""Take away my pain"" song ... stop writing cry-baby lyrics."
2,"I hate to admit it, but I don't like it.","I have been a loyal DT fan; but ever since Train of thought they have been making heavier and more angry sounding records. I can't relate to that stuff, and I don't like it much. The older I get, the less I dig it. Unfortunately, this album doesn't have 1 song on it that I enjoy. I think that metal enthusiasts will enjoy it, but if you're like me and like the early stuff, this may not be a winner for you."
1,Garbage,Dream theater is good and they ARE BETTER than this material that they made. It seems a little too much and as if they're trying to hard to make music still.
3,It's okay...,"Okay, I'm not huge into this album, but there are three must have songs on it. If nothing else, buy those three on iTunes or something. ""Forsaken,"" ""Constant Motion,"" and ""Dark Eternal Night."" Even though I didn't really bond with the other songs on the album, the DVD that comes with the deluxe edition is hella cool and I really enjoyed watching the guys at work in the studio.I won't whine about the past, because I was a hardcore DT fan for Images and Awake. After Infinity, which I could not, and still cannot, get into, I didn't listen to them for a long time. I am a huge Kevin worshipper, but I have accepted that Kevin won't be back, and I'm a huge Jordan fan too. Bottom line, don't buy the whole CD if you're not completely hardcore, dedicated DT fan status. It's about as simple as that."
3,Systematic Ego,"DT is one of my most favorite bands. I have liked or loved evey cd by them. I have to say though that this cd sounds like tracks that might of gotten left of some of there better cd's.There constant fast paced noodling on this cd makes it almost unbearable to listen to. I get it!! You guys can play! Labrie is starting to sound bored, and who could blame him? Everything just sounds so recycled and blurred together. Not to mention the lyrics and melodies are getting realy stale.I agree with some of the other poster's in that they have just spread themselves way to thin. I think they need a break as well. As much music as they put out they have surely earned it.The only real positive is that even a bad DT cd is better than most, but still very dissapointing."
2,Great album...but defective record.,"I can go on and on about how amazing the album and the band is but for some reason the record I recieved was falty. The final song, ""In the Presence of Enemies Part 2"" wasn't on it for some reason. Instead ""The Ministry of Lost Souls"" appeared a second time in place of it. Hopefully for anyone else's sake, this was just an error on my product and no other ones. We'll see when I get a replacement for it."
2,Great musicians....but James labrie i cant stand this guy,"pettruci, portnoy, myung, ...great musicians! am I the only one that thinks JAMES LABRIE kept this band from being the best prog rock band on the planet? but wait people think they are and give alot of credit to james....."
3,Not their best.,But if you're a fan you'll probably like some of it anyway. Some great musicianship as usual. Sounds rather un-inspired. Fairly good sound quality and engineering. A little flat. It would have been nice if they would have issued the DVD version with a 96khz/24bit stereo track but it only has a 5.1 Surround...eh? Expected more from DT.
3,Not too good.,I love DT but this cd was disappointing. It seems like they just wanted to knock out a cd and get it over with. I am glad Petrucci decided to go a little harder on this cd. I would not recommend this cd. I'm seeing them at Cal-Berkeley next month and hopefully they will not play much of this cd. Latez!
2,Dispair Theater??? What happened to the Dream?,"DT's musicianship is solid as ever, but their lyrics are becoming so dark and depressing that I want to find a knife and slash my wrists after my first listening. I used to be excited and inspired after listening to a DT CD, but ever since Octavarium, they have taken a downward trip to the depths of dispair...it is really sad. John Petrucci is probably the biggest offender here. With his lyrics for ""In the Presence of Enemies Parts 1 and 2, and especially ""The Dark Eternal Night"" and ""The Ministry of Lost Souls"". He (They) have got to lighten up a bit. I am sad to say that this will be the first of all the DT CDs that I have that I will be selling to the Used CD store. I hope they ""dream"" of something more positive next time."
2,Falls on its face,"I am by no stretch a Dream Theater fan, in fact, I only appreciate them for the talent they possess. Often I feel underwhelmed when I hear their music. They do have many albums, and I feel it necessary to clarify that this one is not good for a couple reasons. One, I have noticed Dream Theater die-hard fans will praise every album they have done without a critical eye. Two, a new buyer would be better served starting somewhere else. You may be wondering where else to start, the answer is simple, anywhere else! This album fails in comparison to everything else I have heard by them. You could literally blind choose any other album and be better off. I gave it two stars because I found ""Ministry of Lost Souls"" and ""In the Presence of Enemies part 1"" to be fairly engaging. If you still feel unconvinced go and buy ""Images and Words"" at the same time you pick this up and tell me that this isn't horrible."
2,Disappointing,"This is easily Dream Theater's worst work to date. Most of these songs are boring and uninspired, and mainstream sounding. Not in a good way like Falling Into Infinity, but in a ""Metallica meets Rush and absolutely overshadows Rush"" kind of way. The only great on this album was ""In Presence of Enemies"", a 23 minute epic which is probably one of their best newer songs. Dream Theater has now completely thrown away their old styles from long ago, and stepped into the territory of mainstream metal. I can only hope their future albums are much better than the creative disaster Systematic Chaos was."
2,Overblown nonsence,As my first introduction to Dream Theater I have to say I was pretty pissed after I bought this cd. I bought it on the strengh of Ministry of lost souls which is why I gave the cd 2 stars and not 1. I finally realise why I hate Prog Rock (with the exception of anything John Oliva does) It is so over blown over polished all of its soul has been ripped out. Were is the rawness this stuff is so sanitised who in this band has such a fragile ego that they dare not leave any sparkle left in this music they have to make sure every lick is perfect every chord played to a T every drum hit just exactly right uhg!The singer is good I do like him and have heard he has done some solo stuff maybe that will be better
3,"As Always Great Music, Really crappy vocals","Always loved dream theaters music but the vocals are just plain horrible. What in the world are they thinking, why even sing if it's going to be that bad?"
3,the box,why is it every single modern prog band is mired in horrible industry standard sound production?
2,OMG DO SOMETHING NEW!,"Once again, Dream Theater sought out to make a heavy metal sound, and ruin it by letting James Lebrie near a microphone. Dream Theater ""was"" my favorite band, but not really since Train of Thought, and then dropped them altogether when Octavarium came out and they still thought they were god's greatest gift to music. They need a new vocalist on each an every album, in my opinion, to pull off what they want to do. I've heard metal done better by.. hmm.. metal bands? I've heard Dream Theater done better by.. well you get the point. They need a new singer, and they need to tighten their sound. Better than Octavarium and Train? certainly. Is it any good? NO WAY! don't bother purchasing this album, DT doesn't deserve your money for this garbage."
3,"Lotta good, but also a lotta lame","There are lots of cool parts in this album, but there's also many cheesy parts that are just plain embarrassing that I hope nobody in the car next to me hears. It's not fun when you have to fast-forward the track to avoid the really lame vocals.I'd say half the album is sweet, other half is just plain lame - better than Octavarium though (more original at least). But still not as good as I&W; and Awake.And who else besides me hates keyboard solos??? I mean really - solos should be left to the guitarist. Maybe if what Jordan was doing wasn't so irritating to listen to, I don't know..."
2,I don't even need to hear the album to give it a bad review,"How weird that the departure of a keyboardist can lead to the demise of a band's quality, but there has NOT been a great album from this band since ""Awake"". The opening tracks on ""Scenes from a Memory"" and a couple songs I found on Limewire that don't even appear on ""Train of Thought"" even though they came out at the same time are the ONLY comparable tunes this band has come up with since ""Awake"". Everything else has been so boring and pointless that it doesn't even matter these guys are so talented... the music has no rock 'n' roll soul whatsoever, and the lyrics are either a ripoff of ""Operation Mindcrime"" or some boring diatribe that doesn't contain the grabbing horror and imaginative images that the albums with Moore contained. Thus, I'm 99.9% sure this new album is as disappointing as everything they've done this millenium, and I will not be giving it the time of day."
5,Dream Theater is BACK!,This is their best album since Six Degrees (If not their best album to date.)
5,A journey into the depths of the tortured soul we sometimes think we are,"I'm not a die hard heavy prog fan,but, I have been getting into the sound of Dream Theater over the last few years. I was anxious for this disc and I am not disappointed.They exhibit a difference from song to song which I cant find on some bands releases. I love Forsaken. I did not find the album discontinuous at all. Very well done. A band that can be proud of the work they have done without being pretentious, this is not self indulgent resting on your laurels tripe. Maybe I like it because I am so tortured but really have it pretty good. Poor pitiful me. Maybe I have been Forsaken..."
2,When did DT become Pantera,"DT has been on a change of course since SDOIT. They have become Pantera. While this album mellows out a little, still not classic DT like I and W, and M2, or Awake.I have been a fan since the beginning,and have seen them in concert over a dozen times, but I think they have jumped the shark."
2,Pandering to the metal subsect.,The few thrilling interplays amidst this total screech-and-sludgefest are almost a slap in the ear.
5,A systematic and progressive metal,"An excellent album, is a combination of heavy metal during the first half and melodic/progressive in the second half, just like Dream Theater does. I really like it.The DVD shows the making of the album.........is like a ""reality show"" of the entire album, very interesting. There are interviews to the members, some funny things during the recording and technical info of the recording process.In addition, I live in Chile and I did not have any problem with the payment and the arrival date."
3,Not their best,"A good cd, but check out Symphony X's new one for some better song writing, and tunes that are just more fun to rock out to. Mike P said he wanted all the tunes on SC to be cool, I don't think they quite made it. Most of the better instumental sections I've heard done very similar and better on other DT cd's."
3,"Not bad, but not great","I have been a Dream Theater fan for 11 years and this album was mostly a disappointment. I pretty much agree with ""James Hare's"" review, except I couldn't care less about what lyrics they write (DT fans listen to DT to hear Petrucci and Portnoy and Myung do things that none of us can do, not to hear Labrie sing mediocre lyrics).There are a few bright spots on this album (Forsaken and Constant Motion are pretty cool) but for the most part, this album just doesn't have it's own character like past DT albums. Octavarium also struggled to come into it's own unique identity.If you are buying your first Dream Theater album I recommend in the following order:Scenes from a Memory (1999)Falling into Infinity (1997)Train of Thought (2003)Images and Words (1992)Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (2002)"
5,killer metal melodic metal!!!,buy the MVI DVD of this LP. You'll love it. Its a great listen or view or both w/ pictures from the songbook on the tv 1 for each song just like in the book and easy browsing with your remote + bonus featrures that rock!!!
5,"A fast, funny read...with surprises","I picked up this book, took it poolside, and literally did not put it down. Jennifer Archer's multi-generational tale of three strong women on the verge of big changes is laugh-out-loud funny. What surprised me were the poignant moments, the little tugs through rich characters with all their realistic flaws and foibles. Belle's letters to her deceased husband Harry made me cry more than once. (Which makes for a mess when you're slathered in sunscreen.) The ending was wholly satisfying, and I felt like each of the story lines were compelling and complimentary to the others.I'll be looking for Ms. Archer's next book..."
5,Loved it!,"I loved this book. I think it is her best by far. I think she did a great job of letting you get to know the main three characters. This book made me laugh and cry. The letters from ""Belle"" to her deceased husband were so sweet. Buy it, you will love it."
2,Uninvolving performance,"Far better performances of these pieces are available from, e.g., Peter Hurford (Decca/London), or Jozef Sluys (Koch Discover Int'l). I am somewhat amazed that the other reviewers gave this CD 5 stars. Also, contrary to the assertion made by another reviewer, there are plenty of other single-CD recordings with all the sonatas - at least 6 currently available. ... I wanted to get a recording of Mendelssohn's organ sonatas after hearing them played at church. I did buy this Naxos recording and was very disappointed in the performance, which to me sounded rushed and superficial, missing the depth and subtlety of the music. ... I would very much recommend the Jozef Sluys (which is also available at budget price) recording over this one. ... Naxos has some very good CDs in its organ music series, but this isn't one of them."
2,87% organic..,"First off. I dont like this product so much. Its about 4 oz for ten bucks. It claims its organic but not fully, 87%. When I used it, after my normal wash, it left my skin feeling oily. Maybe this is for people with dry skin, it did not specify. I usually use a scrub on my face and have no issues. This felt very sticky like. Didn't feel like it was scrubbing my face, and was watery. I just dont like this products results. 2 stars was for it being organic, the other 3 stars would be for if it worked and didn't add excess oil."
1,Missing information on CD,"Generally speaking studio recordings are always better than live recordings and that is why I personally prefer them. Unfortunately on this CD there is a few live recordings with no reference to that fact anywhere on the CD. I hate clapping and ovations in the middle of the songs!! Not recomended if you are looking for nice, original clean recordings."
4,"Art of the Baroque Trumpet, Vol 2","Art of the Baroque Trumpet, Vol 2 is an album that explores the art of the baroque trumpet and is played by Niklas Eklund. The sound quality is great but not as good as that of a Deutsche Grammophon recording. However, NAXOS is a budget record company and one has to take this into account as one listens to their recordings. Being a huge fan of Baroque music this was a must listen and I dare say I was very pleased. Recommended. 4/5."
1,Health as Expanding Consciousness,"This is one of the most absurd works I have ever come across. It reads like a bad acid trip from the 60's, which may have been the inspiration. It contains such nuggets of wisdom such as health is the same as disease, rocks have consciousness, and we are energy fields rather than human beings. It would be hysterically funny if not for the fact that colleges are actually teaching this nonsense in nursing programs! Do yourself a favor and pass this one by!"
5,good sox,"These socks are cushioned but not bulky. Also, the toe seam is flat and does not rub. Ankle length is perfect."
4,Great read.,"Not only does this book present an incredibly vivid portrayal of a not to distant past full of scandal and political intrigue (not to mention sorcery!), it is full of the brillaint insights of Aldous Huxley. Both are equaly eye opening and valid today."
3,Religion and Hysteria,"Not an easy read, the writing the style is too academic for the leisure readed, however the influence of the church of the period is facinating and frightening."
4,Good quality and price as long as you don't need it today.,"Good quality. Good Price and free shipping. What else needs to be said other than if your not in a hurry, it's the savings is worth the wait."
3,A bit confusing,"After being enthralled with Brave New World, I decided to check out this book, since the premise seemed really interesting. However, unlike BNW, it's not a full blown narrative. I really want to enjoy this book but at times it proved to be overwhelming to a casual reader like me. I find myself being confused over some of the concepts that Huxley delves into. However, I will do my best to get through it. The section of Grandier and Phillipe's amorous development and downfall highlights the exceptional writing gift that Huxley has."
2,not good,"what was that performer thinking. ok, i admitted tha concerto 1 is very hard, but toooooooooooooo slow. go listen to the one played by gil shaham, it's one of the best. also, you can hardly hear the bass! and...tooooo slow. even i could play that in that tempo. the orchestra was out of order, very messy, just like a big blah."
4,Pretty good.,"Patterns, patterns and patterns. Connect the right dots together, and Wa-Lah! . . . you've got something. This book provides the human indicators to keep your eyes and ears open for when dealing with friend or foe."
2,the wrong focus,"Trust yourself. There's no technique or set of behaviors to memorize. If you get a feeling from someone that doesn't connect to the words they're saying, don't suppress it. If you don't open yourself up to all of your sensory input, learning details will mean nothing."
2,The other reviewers are right on,"Unfortunately, I bought the book while browsing, rather than doing my usual checkups on Amazon.I like that the author approaches the four different aspects of reading people to give an overall sense of the person, rather than just focusing on body language or personality by itself. If I can find another book on the same subject but written better, then I'd love to read it. But I had to skim past the inane quizzes, the arrogant examples, and the oversimplified explanations. In doing so, I think I may have missed a few of the good points she probably makes. I know I'll try to re-read it, because there are some good things in the book, they're just more difficult to find."
5,Crystal Clear,This is one of the most informative books that I have read on the subject. Lillian is direct and easy to follow. I would highly recomend this book to anyone who wants to improve thier people skills. It would even be a great gift for the holidays.
1,Not very good,There's some useful information but it's extremely difficult to find through all the pointless little quizzes and stories about how awesome the author is at reading people.
1,reading this book,Buying this book is a waste of money. Reading this book is a waste of time. The author is evidently narcissitic. The author is not shy about dropping names of the famous people she has treated. All the examples are of famous and affluent people she knows. The thoughts are only partially developed. She begins a subject and leaves you hanging. The chapters are very generic and things you already know. The book is an advertisement for herself and at the back she has a full page devoted to contacting her to do business with her. Your money and time would be well spent looking elsewhere for help on this subject.
1,Agree with others - fluff and arrogance,"I agree with the other reviewers in labeling this book as ""fluff"" and an opportunity for the author to talk about how great she is. She uses extreme categories liberally throughout this book - trying to pigeon-hole people into descriptive categories that are narrow and negative. For someone with a terminal degree, she provided not one reference or citation to studies that she referred to while attempting to validate her points. This book is not scientifically based and there is NO way that Oprah would have this woman or her book on her show!"
2,Fluff,"I found the first third of the book to be interesting and useful in helping me become aware of people around me. I notice a lot more about people in public after reading that first portion.The rest of the book was very single-minded, opinionated, and arrogant. It was very difficult to drag the helpful information from the book. Most of what she lists in the book are examples of extreme personalities, and aren't helpful when trying to ""read"" people in average situations (at a meeting, conference, or restaurant)."
3,This is a LIVE album,This is a live recording NOT the original studio cuts. There is no indication on the cd cover that it is a live recording. You don't realize it until you play it for the first time.
1,Awful,I love Peter Cetera and all of the songs listed on this album. But this recording (live) is awful. Waste of my money.
2,Varied but not very good,"I was pleased that the CD included three of my favorite duets, but they were not the original recordings. I really wish I had read the feedback on the page more carefully prior to purchasing this or I wouldn't have done it, as I wanted the original tracks. Therefore, I got all of the songs that I wanted, but not the recordings I wanted. :("
3,Shakey Run.,"Pretty flimsy story and acting but I love road films.Great views of the Clyde Dam,Queenstown,Cardrona and the Rimutuka`s even though the continuity is all out."
1,This is a piece of junk!,"I purchased two of these items, one as a gift. This was a big mistake. They have expensive batteries which only last for a couple of train whistles. Apparently they do not have a good connection and that's why they fail. It's really mickey-mouse."
4,"Nice performances, boring production quality","Great band- I've seen them a bunch of times. My only problem with this CD is the amateurish production. You can tell that it is basically homemade. It is a fine recording, I just wish that they would get into a top studio with a good producer to get a fuller, more polished sound. This is recorded pretty much straight, which is, I guess, a more jam band purist approach. I haven't heard the other CD's yet."
3,Hard Ball is Soft!,"""Hardball"" (the book and report) is a great beginning for the focus and tenacity needed to compete in a global economy. However, the title is misleading. The term, ""Hardball"" conjures up ideas from Ayn Rand and Machiavelli--take no prisoners and act rationally in your self-interest. Not so! It takes you there, but doesn't pull the trigger. It lacks the rawness and edge truly needed to slay the dragon and gain control within an industry.It leaves the ""Rah Rah"" 1990s, but doesn't effectively enter the George Bush World. It's a good read from the ""Poly Anna"" books that often truncate the pragmatism of human nature.Edward BrownCore Edge Image & Charisma Institute, Inc."
4,A singular talent,"Her words were always her words, her voice was always evident in each word she put to paper. I heard her speak at a Writer's Workshop seminar at the University of Cincinnati when I was a senior in High School. She shares the same birthday as another one of my favorites (Prince)and she writes about her experiences as a person of color and as a product of her enviroment. Everyone comes from some place, and in her works you will get to see this place and meet the people and part of you will feel as if you grew up with her. This is a definite must have for anyone looking for the best of the comtemporary poets. You won't be disappointed."
3,Nice Fun,"It is what it is! A nice fun handy monocular. A bit small in field of vision as in how wide an area is seen through the view finde. But tons of fun at the beach and the games, easily held in one hand. Not easily seen by others. Nice, Fun."
1,"Bad Item, not able to focus.","I could not get the item to focus. Item has lifetime warranty, but you must send $10.00 to cover shipping and handling. Item only cost $9+on Amazon. Don't buy!"
3,reasonable,"this monoscope is reasonable for the price of under $15 when i first used it for spying on my tricky neighbors i found it worked reasonably well at a long distance. If you plan on using it for examining thing such as flowers, grass whatever but don't get to close; around 15-17in. is a reasonable distance. I hope this reveiw was helpful"
2,Eh,"It's okay. Not the best monocular I've used. I am visually impaired, so I use it to see the board in my classes. It gets the job done though."
4,"Actually quite good quality, for the money","This little scope doesn't compare to the high-end pocket scopes out there, however, it does produce a very sharp image, it has decent focus and seems to be fairly well made. What more can you ask for at this price."
5,Perfect,"What else can I say? This is a product that does exactly what it is supposed to do. Fast shipping, excellent optics, great price."
3,Good pocket scope,"Use this as a cheap spotting scope I can leave in my pocket at the range. Only issue is that it isn't very glasses friendly. The eyepiece will fold flat so you can place it directly on your glasses, but the FOV is noticeably smaller compared to using it without glasses."
1,Junk,Don't wast your money. My bare naked eye worked better than this monocular. Spend your money on an eye chart for better results.
4,Acceptable For Quick Viewing,"I bought this monocular as a pocketable magnifier for traveling, and occasional bird/tree viewing.I was surprised by the relatively good build quality, considering the price. The monocular is light, but has a good ""feel""-not cheap.I do agree with other viewers that a 10X magnification makes ""hand-shake"" an issue.The fully magnified viewing field is also narrow, so don't expect a wide, binocular-like viewing field of the object you're observing.Still, for quick glimpses of objects, this monocular is ideal, the price is excellent, it's easy to carry, and the build quality is very good."
4,Good for what it is but too powerful for some tasks,"I bought the Tasco 10x25 monocular as a lightweight alternative to binoculars that I could slip into my pocket. I have no complaints about the product - it is well made and lightweight.I would suggest, though, that 10x is probably too powerful for most tasks. If I had to do it over again, I would go with an 8x or even 6x scope. The problem is that there is more jitter when holding a monocular versus a binocular. Also the field of view is very limited. This means that locating and focusing on a particular target is difficult. If you and your target are fixed (e.g. golf course), there is no problem. For finding and viewing targets which are more difficult to locate (e.g. birds) I would recommend a smaller magnification."
1,Terrible build quality.,I purchased three of these for gifts. One broke the first day. The second broke within a week. The third rattles. Absolute ****.
5,works great for me!,"I have used mine for over 4 years now. I work outside everyday rain or shine. I read electric meters for a living. My Tasco 10x25 is great for this job. This particular model focuses in very tight with a small feild of vision. For my job its great, But, most people wish to have a wider angle. If you want a wider angle dont buy this product. If your looking for something that will focus close and tight on an object this is great!!!"
3,Alright,This took forever forever forever (said like on The Sandlot) to ship and when we got it it wasn't the (brown camo) it was just plain black. It does work and is small and compact though which is nice.
3,Worth the $11 I spent,"I've been shooting archery from longer distances lately, up to about 70-80 yards, and at that distance it's difficult to fine tune my sights between shots. A lot of the guys who shoot from that range have very expensive, tripod-mounted, spotting scopes. I can't afford that and my eyes are relatively young so I thought I could get away with a much cheaper alternative. This does the job, but just barely. It's really not that much of a zoom and the field of view is very small and uncomfortable to use.I'm a professional mariner and I know good optics when I use them. This isn't it. It is good enough to be a cheap, small, device I can leave in my bow case and use once a week or so."
2,More toy than tool,"I see a number of people like this so maybe it was the one i got, but I found the image quality/clarity to be nearly unusable. The image looking at a known scene (our back yard) was very challenging to actually identify. The great disparity between what I got and what most of the ratings are lead me to be open-minded that maybe I got a bad one but I was not willing to go through an exchange cycle to find out."
2,too simple,It's too simple device. I think it will be good for children.The quality is 3 stars of 5. I don't know what you mean for this price.
3,Its okay,"Nothing to write home about. Gets the job done. I dislike the fact that it doesn't provide a large field of vision when I stick my eye all the way up into it, but I'm guessing this is common to all monoculars in this price range. Aside from that, no complaints."
3,pocket telescope,I bought this for work. I need to see small numbers on boxes 10 to 15 feet above me. This little guy didn't do the job. I now keep it in the Jeep and use it to see things that are farther away and it is just OK.
2,Poor quality and design,"The rubber armor around the objective lens came off the day that I received it. It was held on by two very small dabs of glue which did not adhere to the rubber at all. The rubber piece was very loose fitting and would not stay on without adhesive. The body under the rubber is metal (aluminum?), but somewhat thin-walled. The eyepiece adjustment ring also loosened with initial use and appears to be made of cheap plastic materials. The unit is definitely not waterproof, and likely not splash resistant. The eyecup folds down for use with eyeglasses, but it makes little difference because it has such short eye relief making it uncomfortable to use. The high magnification, narrow field of view, and dim optics make for a poor viewing experience."
4,Great for the price...,"I'm visually impaired. I was looking for a monocular that I can keep in my bag for when I need to see something distant, like a sign. There are many very high priced ones that are sold by speciality shops for the visually impaired. This one does the job very well, and it costs much less than the others. It is larger, but still small enough to keep in a book bag, or messenger bag. I'm very pleased with the quality of this product."
1,"Soft focus, worthless","I bought this based upon the other reviews. I didn't expect much from an inexpensive monocular but thought it could be helpful on an upcoming trip to the Galapagos. Well, it is useless - very small viewing area and, what you can see is in very ""soft"" focus. In other words, things are enlarged but they're not terribly clear and because the field of view is so narrow, you really need to hunt for whatever you're looking for.It probably isn't worth the shipping cost for me to return it, otherwise, I would."
3,"Good knife for the money, difficult to clean",I wanted a utility knife for skinning and quartering game. The knife has a decent edge and the edge holds up okay. The zipper is handy for iviscerating w/o puncturing. The knife is a little wide for close in work but is well suited as a general purpose skinner. Probably wouldn't want to cape with as it doesn't get into tight spaces well. The texturized handle gives a good grip but it's a bear to get the fat and blood out of all the crevices when you are cleaning.Overall a decent knife for the money but not a one knife does it all in my book.
5,Informative and Entertaning,I found this book quite informative and entertaining. It was recommended by one of my instructors when I went to recording school and I can see why. Working in the Post Production industry I got a couple of laughs when I related to things the author wrote about. Good read even if you're not an audiophile but just a music fan. Love the behind the scenes stuff.
4,Niiiiiiiice,"I'm not a big fan of the ""Tabernacle Choir"" or ""Jolly guy singing around the fire"" kind of Christmas music, so when I heard a selection from this collection, I was curious. Needless to say, my curiosity made me buy this collection of fine remixes of classic Christmas tunes.... and look, no barking dogs....."
5,Holiday Chillin',"I bought this CD a few years ago, and I still love it! It's got a great ""vibe"". I really only listen to holiday chill/remixes now!Check it out!"
4,"Overall, a really good mix.","Personally, I can't stand either the typical ""classic"" Holiday music, or the pop remakes of it. So, in order to get in the Holiday Spirit, I have a bunch of the electronica-techno-electro-whatever-you-want-to-label-it Holiday Music.Just picked this one up this year, and, compared to the others in my collection, I like it a lot. There are a couple of tracks I don't care for, they go a bit ""too eclectic"" for me, but overall, and especially for the price, this is a good one to own if you want to add some new tunes to your techno-holiday music collection."
3,Gregorian chant,"I enjoy the CD, though I find I prefer the traditional all-male voices in Gregorian chant. The male chanters have such beautiful voices on this CD."
3,"Fun game, poor graphics...","I owned this game right after it originally came out and I was impressed by most aspects of it. It's based off of the Age of Empires II game engine, so I knew it would probably be good. I got rid of it a few years ago and just bought it again today. Even with the graphic details set to high and the screen set at 1024x768 (the largest it will allow me to set), the image quality is poor. My laptop's native resolution is 1440x900, so everything looks HUGE on my screen. The game's action is still fun, but the animation of characters isn't nearly as good as Age of Empires II, the game it's based on. I dunno. I'll probably get bored with it real soon and sell it."
5,Best Star Wars RTS!,This is the best Star Wars RTS hands down! I have used up so many hours playing this game. Many other people have reviewed this and gave it a detailed run down so I wont. But I will say if you ever wondered about getting this game DO IT!!
5,Worth every cent,"This game is one of the best PC games I've ever played in my life. The graphics are great, the storyline is great, the whole game is great!!!!"
3,Star Wars Battlegrounds,"I love this game because of the Star Wars nostalgia. Age of Empires is one of my favorite computer games, and with it having a Star Wars theme it's even cooler. However, the graphics are not so up-to-date anymore. When I played years ago when it first came out, it was amazing. But now that game quality has improved over the years, playing this game again is not as exciting. I wish they would come up with a newer version, using the latest ""Age of Empires"" engine. But for what it's worth, it's a decent game that I enjoy playing from time to time."
4,Worth the money,"It's a thin Star Wars veneer to Age of Empires 2. It's actually very fun, but I had some issues:1. Infantry can't shoot aircraft like in StarCraft. (???)2. There's a bunch of random, un-canon units. Races aren't as varied as I'd like.3. One of the playable factions is the Gungan race. Need I say more?4. They leave out a bunch of units they should have used and replaced them with very questionable alternatives. (i.e. instead of an Imperial Star Destroyer, they have what looks like a cross between a pickup truck and a tie fighter. A gigantic tie fighter)5. Weird voice acting and unit responses. Sounds nothing like the real thing.Other than that, it's a lot of fun, especially with the scenario editor. The editor, the same one Age of Empires 2 uses, is the simplest out of any RTS I've ever played, and the only one where you can place any unit in the game and watch it fight another unit immediately. Very useful for recreating your favorite Star Wars battles!"
2,Very disappointing.,"I bought this book on the basis of Scott Kelby's glowing recommendations. Having gone through the book, either Kelby's taste differs from mine or he was doing another author a favor.There is very little on using Photoshop as a web design tool. The book, while extremely well illustrated and designed, is nothing more than another cookbook of Photoshop hints and tips. It is not particularly well written and is often sparse on detail. Many of the tecchniques are taken from others (some with appropriate attribution provided). The substantial number of pages devoted to Adobe GoLive are wasted -- unless you are a GoLive user.Overall, not a book I would recommend and one that I am strongly considering returning while I can.Jerry"
1,poorly done,"This type of book is invariably rushed to print to coincide with the release of new software versions.This book is no exception, very poorly organized with no cohesive thread from beginning to end.This is supposed to be book on using photoshop 7 and go-live 6 together to create web pages, yet there are 20 pages on doing just that and dozens of pages of pretty color wheels and charts meant to fill up space."
5,Kosher gourmet cooking,"We actually bought this book by chance, as it was the first kosher cookbook we had ever actually seen in a bookshop here in town. And what a pleasant surprise!The charming layout can perhaps best be compared to Joyce Esersky Goldstein's great books, e.g. Cucina Ebraica: Flavors of the Italian Jewish Kitchen, but while Mrs. Goldstein serves down-to-earth Mediterranean food in a wonderful way, Mrs. Kirschenbaum's recipes seem heavenly inspired.The recipes are a proof that kosher can be for gourmets as well.Additionally, so far I have not found any detail not corresponding to Kashrut, while other kosher cookbooks are sometimes a bit careless in this respect."
3,"Cynical, are we?","Before you jump to conclusions and immediately take in all of what Wizzkid said, I notice he left out an important few things. First of all, considering the catagory in which this book is placed, it would be safe to assume that much of what was submitted was written by younger children. Certainly the quality of the poetry varies, and for such a belittling review to be posted without description of age or circumstance, I wonder if it is that you submitted a poem you found exceptional, and were disgusted when you realized it was placed in the same genre as a 5 year old... Fellow poetry readers/writers, don't believe everything one says until the entire story is outspoken."
1,people these days!!,"get this book or not.. all i'm going to say is that it's true. books from the international library of poetry are all scams. every ""contestant"" that sends in a poem will recieve mail within a month or so saying that they are in the semi-finalists for this and that.. and saying that you can buy the book or not at your choice...of course you're gonna buy it because you think you achieved something big. sorry but i fell for the same thing. ask anybody that has entered the contest or try it out for yourself at poetry.com. it's sad because there are many talented people that really tried.. there are good poems in the book. but the whole system is corrupt. read reviews for their other books.. there's more on the scams .. ""The Fountain Of Peace"" ""Dances In Moonlight"" ""Chorus of the Soul"" ""Dances in Moonlight"" ""As Minutes Turn to Hours"".. etc.."
1,Vanity publishing,"This book and all other anthologies by this crowd come under the category of vanity publishing. If you submit a poem on their website they will write to you telling you it is the best thing ever written and that it will go in the next book. They then tell you you can buy a copy for an exhorbitant sum, or maybe two copies, or maybe six. They promise your poem is in whether you buy a copy or not. This is untrue. They make their money by selling copies to the poets themselves. Very few others are sold and no wonder... Over fifty bucks for a book?????"
1,Better on paper than on film.,"I'm sure if this movie had been written in a book, it would've caught my interest more. Not soft porn by any means, and definitely not hardcore. Dinosaurs are cheesy and the set looks like the hills of California. However, given the funds I'm sure weren't available, it was a nice laugh."
2,It needs to be a campy porn movie.,"First of all, we need penetration in the sex scenes. Showing simulated sex just does not do it anymore. Who care's if they get an x-rating. Hasn't anyone ever thought of having a good plot with the sex before. Anyway, when making a movie like this too, the girls need to be constantly getting both tops and bottoms ripped off by themselves (love the catfight, best part of the movie), cavemen, and/or dinosaurs."
5,Worst Movie Ever Made!!,"This is by far the worst movie ever made.. I tell you. Its not even good for masterbation material. I tried and I just couldnt do it... If you buy this movie, you are a bigger idiot than me!"
3,YUM,"Laughable plot, bad acting, goofy special effect - I loved it! This movie has no pretention. Just a goofy movie with plenty of yummy gratuitous nudity!"
3,Out there,Unique and edgy. Hard to say but not unusual for Brandford. I really like the Crazy People Music album of the 90's better. Also the audio on Braggtown was muffled and not well mixed.
3,An Insightful Game for Everyone,"This is both fun and educational. In the spirit of fun and humor, one is able to get a better insight of himself and those around him."
2,Not true 3D - Could be better.,"This video uses the Pulfrich effect for 3D, meaning that with glasses that have one dark lens objects that have backgrounds moving sideways across the screen have the illusion of of 3D. Only some of the scenes use this effect. And although some of the quality is good, a lot of this video is filler with not enough time of the women on the screen."
5,Not Another Blonde!,"I just finished reading this book basically because I knew of the author and wanted to see her work. I was really impressed with the writing, and so much so, I passed it along to my fiance, who in turn started to pass it to her friends. If you are into deep talks on image, perspective, or just Barbie, it's great. I honestly didn't think I would be able to understand it or get much from it because I'm a guy not into dolls, but I really took a bit away with me. I just wonder if the author ever wanted to be a blonde?"
1,An undergraduate thesis,"I usually do not review books on-line, but I was so disappointed with this book that I felt it necessary. For anyone interested in buying this book, it should be pointed out that this is clearly an undergraduate thesis -- with all the errors and theoretical naivety of undergraduate writing. I am a college professor and honestly would be thrilled if I had Ms. Weissman as a student, but when I purchase a text I am looking for a higher standard than a good piece of undergraduate work. The book has an excellent bibliography and the author clearly did her research. An excellent term paper, but nothing more than that."
4,"Great brass sound-a new spin on Blood, Sweat and Tears","I had searched high and low for a CD by this group and I am pleased that I found it. An excellent selection of music. I was not disapointed! There sound is reminiscent of Blood Sweat and Tears, a group that I have always appreciated. Fine musicians all around!"
4,Good digital,"This camera is good for point and shoot. However when in auto the pictures seem to have a lot of noise. I think this is one of the main problem with Panasonic sensor; Even when I fix the iso at 80, there seems to be a lot noise.The camera takes good pictures at sufficient light. I am especially impressed by the movie mode. It can take really good quality movie at 30 fps. Overall at this price I think it is a good camera."
4,Lumix DMC-L25K Digital Camera Review,"I do a lot of fishing, hunting and hiking and wanted a ""smaller"" camera. This camera balanced size, performance and price better than anything else I could find. It is quick and easy to use ( after you spend a good amount of time understanding how to use it and it's seemingly endless options ). Many of the pictures that I end up taking are either in bright sun or frequently in the woods with a blend of light and dark that can be difficult for some cameras to meter properly. This one handles both situations very well. I also needed a camera that would meter/adjust to quick movements. So far this has handled that pretty well also. For the money, you will be hard pressed to find a camera that does as well as this one"
4,"Great zoom, Great color. Great Image Stabilizer, Little noise","This product has got great zoom 6x (compared to other compacts), great and accurate color. The Image stabilizer is rare in models in this price range.Only cons, little noise.At 6.3MP really did not matter to me as I print in A4 or Letter.Oh yes, and movie quality is also really good. zoom cannot be changed while movie recording is going on."
4,"Good Camera, Nice Quality","Though it is my very first digital camera, but I think in first buy itself I made a wise decision. :-) Initially I was bit scared while buying it over well know products Canon/Sony. Picture quality is very good, zoom works pretty fine though couldn't make out till now how to make the optimal use of both digital & optical zoom combinedly. Dim light is not atall a problem with this camera. Even the night pictures are as bright as day light pictures. Yet to explore the other features of this, but in the last 2 days it seems to be a good buy."
4,Great camera for regular user,"I have been using it for almost a month and it has worked perfectly. My only complain is that the batteries that it includes lasts less that the middle of time that it says. However, you can replace them with Alcalina which works good.Great product for a regular user."
4,Story Time Fun!,"I'm a teenager and I still enjoy reading the stories. Offodile adds such a creative touch to the stories that keep me enchanted. I'm glad that he has captured so many of these folktales in writing so that I can share them with my children as well. I am lucky, being born of Igbo parents, since my mother can sing the songs to me the way they are supposed to be sung. It is very interesting how similar the stories that aren't even from Nigeria are to the ones that my mother knows. Get this book and keep it in your library for fun stories to enjoy in the future."
5,outstanding!,... certainly this is a outstanding recording of Hotteterre! Execelent: I dare to say that is one of the best releases from NAXOS...
4,Marlena on Columbia,"Never judge a CD by its cover! This shabbily packaged CD includes practically all of Marlena's fine first 2 Columbia lps, ""SWEET BEGINNINGS"" and ""ACTING UP"", except for 1 cut (""I Wonder"", which IS on Marlena's 1999 Sony reissue). This is 70's smooth soul at its finest..."
4,tight set,"I've always dug Me some Marlena shaw.Her direct take on any subject matter always moved me.somewhere Between Betty Wright&Millie Jackson is where you shall find Marlena Shaw.if Erika Badu truly got Her stuff right marlena shaw is who she would sound like.""go away little boy"" was always the Jam.this is a Good set here."
3,One classic and a whole lot of filler,"""Tell Him"" is a genuine classic, a sublime one-shot, a perfect match of singer, song, and arrangement. The singer's limited range, though, eventually wears thin and drags down the rest of the material, which is not terribly strong to begin with. This is the CD to go with, if you're looking for one, since it has the best selection and an informative booklet, but be assured nothing else on the disk approaches the heights of ""Tell Him""."
3,BE ADVISED! Coaches from Single-Sex Schools Need Not Order!,"These two volumes are, indeed, highly useful for forensic coaches...well, for those in co-ed settings, anyway. I was quite surprised to find, when I received these books, that each and every scene was created for the male/female duo pair. The vast majority do not lend themselves to play by single sex pairs. (I had expected a more balanced approach with, perhaps, half designed for the male/female duo and the other half split between scenes for the female/female and male/male duo as is so often the case with scene books.) I actually felt strongly enough about this point to write to the authors--as I hope they will take the needs of those of us in single-sex schools into account and provide us with material too! A LATER ADDITION TO THIS REVIEW: I actually hear from one of the authors--and quite promptly, I might add--who agreed that this was a strong need and indicated that these works are close to completion! So, watch for them!"
2,Sony = Too Bad For Leo,"I was really looking forward to buying this CD after hearing it on the radio; but I will not be able to easily or assuredly rip it to my PC and mp3 player becuase of Sony's bumbling ""anti-piracy"" ( eg anti - customer ) software. I will not purhcase it until I can be assured that I can rip it for use on my other devices without problems."
5,awsome!,I absolutly love this slbum! It has not left my rotation since I bought it! Bound to be a classic -
2,"A ""One Hit"" CD plus the usual Leo Kottke stuff","If you already like Leo Kottke's music you'll probably love this CD, if you are like me, most of this CD would qualify as background music for a busy day.I bought this CD after hearing their cover of ""Sweet Emotion"" on KFOG - I think that song, which they've redone in a minor key (?) and performed in a minimal style - is a work of genius. I had to own it. If you are expecting any of the other songs on this CD to be in the same style you will be sorely disappointed.I hope that the popularity of that one song will inspire them to do more like it.I own maybe 4 Leo Kottke albums, yes he is incredible from a technical point of view, but his music just doesn't grab me. And because this CD is copy protected, you can't take the one great track or simple just get rid of the annoying tracks - you are stuck with the whole CD."
1,"I love Leo, but will not buy copy protected CDs!!!","People need to speak with their wallet, or lack of it, to tell the greedy record companies that we will not tolerate copy protection preventing us from putting our music on our computers and iPods. I love Leo and was looking to buy this but absolutely refuse to do so, no matter how good the recording is."
1,Can't buy it if I can't use it.,"I like the music. I wish I could buy the CD, but I have been screwed by ""content protection"" in the past and vowed that it would not happen again. If you want to sell a CD with content protection, you should spell out exactly what the limitations on my use will be. Otherwise, I'll just move on to the next CD on my extremely long list."
1,All Sony should be recalled,Why is Amazon still selling this and other Sony copy protected CD's when they have stopped selling Neil Diamond's 12 Songs? All of Sony's releases should be pulled off the shelf until this has been resolved- not just the cd getting all the press. I would love to buy this album as well as 12 Songs and am afraid it won't get recalled because it is more obscure.
1,NO WAY,"I know the music is fantastic, but I will NEVER pay Sony to let them ""expose security vulnerabilities"" on my computer! When copy protection puts law-abiding, paying customers at risk, you know something has gone horribly wrong with the priorities of the Corporation. I hope all the various lawsuits still pending take Sony for millions. Or billions!"
4,"Forget the corporate implications, just enjoy the music","This is a great CD. I'm not much of a fan of Kottke, as he's a bit too weird for my liking. But I'm a Phish fan so it was only a matter of time before I checked this out. This is definetly not Phish.I love the island influence, and the style changes between each selection. Each song has its own soul and voice. The only production complaint is that I can't hear Gordo in a lot of songs.Be sure to check out ""Rings"" and ""The Grid"" as great examples of a quality CD.I bought this online to avoid the legal ranglings. Reviews should be kept to the music, not the record company. Got a beef? Write a petition, and keep it off the page."
4,"Not Perfect, but Good Listening","Mike and Leo get together for another excursion. This isn't a repeat of ""Clone"" but think of the sound of Clone with more of an island feel. You have to approach this disc without any preconceptions of what Leo should sound like (this isn't a solo disc) or of Mike from his Phish days. This is two artists trying something a little different. It doesn't always work (""The Grid"", ""Over the Dam"") but at other times, it's pure magic (""Living in the Country"", ""Rings"", ""Balloon"").If you're not a fan of Mike's vocals, there's nothing I can do to convince you, but the cover of ""Sweet Emotion"", even with the dead pan, bland vocals, works for me.If you're coming at this as a fan of Phish, think of the ""Ya Mar"" (a nice fun version here) and that's the sound you can expect from this disc.Overall this is an enjoyable ride."
3,_,"This album is an example of change. these guys are music veterans and are obviously exploring new types of music under the microscope of all the judgemental / diehard phish and leo fans. god forbid these guys put out an album that THEY like. you cant listen to this cd and hope for a phish jam or for kottke to rip a crazy guitar line. youl be dissapointed. if, however, you listen openmindedly you might learn to appreciate something other than what you're use to. i tip my hat to these guys for going out on a limb and putting out this album. cant wait to see them on tour."
1,Would have bought it if not for the copy protection,"I saw Kottke and Gordon play at the ACL Festival last year, and really liked what I heard. While I fully support artists getting paid for their craft, I will not support Sony in their misguided attempt to control their customers."
1,wont play,"dont know what this sounds like, as it wont play on my car or home cd player and locks up my computer with its ""write protection "" software- i will not be buying any more sony/bmg cd's"
1,"Excellent cd, bought it accidently because I didn't notice the copy protection","I bought this cd accidently because I didn't see the copy protection warning. The recording is adequate but a little sterile although the music is excellent. No matter how much you love these musicians, you should not buy copy protected cds. Refusal to purchase is only means to prevent copy protection. I only listen to music that has been loaded into flacs digitally for my home stereo. DRM make this take longer, and who know, if we continue to buy bad products such as this they may one day come up with a DRM scheme that works. It is appropriate to review the DRM scheme because you are reviewing the product and not just the music that is on the product."
5,Can't stop listening to this CD!,"This is a great CD from start to finish. I love the textured, fun natured compositions on this album so much that I have listened to it at every opportunity since purchasing it a week ago. Everytime I listen, my smile just gets wider. Gordon and Kottke together make quite a pair. This is a new, orginal sound for both musicians and it is very clear they had fun making this music. As for the listener, the pleasure both musicians had recording this album is hard to ignore. What's so bad about that?"
4,great musicians!,"I can understand some reviewers being angry with the label for the ""copyright protection"" thing, but come on; the rating should focus more on the music. And what we have on this album is very, very good music. I thought this album was much better than Kottke and Gordon's previous effort, ""Clone"". The playing on both is excellent, especially Kottke's always brilliant guitar, but I thought the song choices on this album were much better. The covers of ""Oh Well"" and ""Sweet Emotion"" are especially inspired ones. I'm not much of a Phish fan, but I've been listening to Leo Kottke since the mid-1970s and to my ears he still sounds great, both vocally and on guitar. I'm very pleased with this album."
4,"Love the songs, hate the CD","This isn't going to be a review on the music. The music is great, I'm assuming that if you are reading this you know enough about Mike and Leo to decide if you will like them. It's folk/calypso style is hard to not like.No this is a review on a horrible, customer un-friendly, CD.This CD comes with copyright protection that makes it impssible to use in my computer. The only way to play the CD on a computer is by using a horrible built in media player that doesn't even work. The only way to rip the cd into your MP3 collection is with said player, which also doesn't work. To boot, the CD tries to install software which, from what I read also spys on your usage and can open you up to spyware. I had known about the spyware issue, but had also read that those disks had been recalled, so I felt fine about purchasing this disk. Sadly I was mistaken, and other than once in my car, have not been able to enjoy my purchase.BEWARE!"
4,Excellent,"I don't understand what the other reviewers are saying. This album is a lot better than Clone. Twice as good. It's very mellow, very relaxing, yet has a very happy vibe to it. The interplay between the two is superb they compliment each other very well. If you're a strait up Phish fan or a strait up Kottke fan this probably isn't for you. This album is geared more towards pickers and fans of acoustic music."
1,another lost customer,"there's plenty of other reviews that have already commented on the copy protection. i just wanted to point out that i'm another lost sale. as a linux user, the copy-protection really wasn't going to stop anything, but it's the principle of the matter.big kottke fan, big mike fan, big ""clone"" fan. sorry guys. maybe one day there will be a real cd i can buy. i'm disappointed."
1,Don't buy this CD!,"I love Leo Kottke, but I would not even dream about buying this CD because of its copy protection. You spend $15 for the CD but then you can't play it in your computer CD player or load it onto an ipod or burn a CD-R for the car so you don't scratch the original. I have hundreds of CDs and have never pirated any of the tracks, yet the music companies won't let me use the music I've paid for. I sympathize with their situation, but copy protection schemes only punish the innocent--the pirates have enough technical knowledge to circumvent the copy protection but the average Joe gets stuck with CDs that can't be used."
1,Not Worth the Price,"Thanks to Amazon for alerting us to the fact that this is ""copy protected."" I've listened to the samples and am not excited. Kottke is a much better picker than me but I like to copy cds and listen in my car during the long hours of bay area commute. This CD is not worth dragging the original around.Sorry, Kottke is not the only guy on the block,,,I'm not buying it."
2,"""SistySix Steps:"" A clone of ""Clone?""","After reading the lone review (previous to mine), it made my decision easy NOT to purchase this CD, and probably be thoroughly disappointed, as I was with ""Clone."" To me, there was no ""chemistry"" between Kottke and Gordon on ""Clone."" I doubt that there will be any this time either. Furthermore, neither of them can sing worth a damn. There are a number of vocals on ""SixtySix Steps,"" which helps to kill my interest. The vast majority of cuts on ""Clone"" were vocals. I listened to it 3 times, hoping to like it better, and could not. I am just not willing to take the risk of being that soundly disappointed again with ""SixtySix Steps."" Kottke is a masterful guitarist with an inimitable style. He needs to make solo albums without the distractions (and detractions) of other musicians and his ""singing"" voice, which was self-described early in his career as ""sounds like geese farts on a muggy day."" Noone has said it better. C'mon, Leo! Quit disappointing your fans!"
2,Baby hates this...,"I personally like the concept. Easy to clean, catches food, bright color. Unfortunately, my daughter hates this bib and complains every time I put it on her. It's hard plastic, so I guess it's uncomfortable around her neck. Quite the shame, really..."
1,Too small!,"This bib was so small around the neck it immediately went to my 3 year old as a play bib for her dolls. No chance at all it would get around my average size 7 month old's neck. Looked nice, but was too small!"
5,love this bib!,"We ordered this bib for one of our friends who has a new baby because we love ours so much!It's so great, because it catches almost everything the baby can spill, even liquids. And it can simply be rinsed out after each meal and ready to use again. We like the design of this bib, too. We had a Kangaroo bib for our first child and it was so hard and unforgiving, she couldn't move. And it was big--too big for stashing in the diaper bag. The Baby Bjorn is smaller, more pliable, and easy to fit in the diaper bag.We love this bib!"
1,Didn't work for my son,"I bought this for my 1 yr old son. He screamed every time I put it on him. I think he hated it because it is a firm plastic and he knew he had it on and it bothered him. I finally had to just put it away and give up. He loves the ""Take-out"" baby bibs. He doesn't seem to notice he has it on and it protects well. Also the ""Take-out"" bib fits nicely in the diaper bag."
2,Baby Bjorn Bib,This bib is too small for my 2 1/2 year old. The closure is very inconvenient and she does not like to wear it.
4,great independent release,"This cd is one of the top independent releases i've heard. Quality varies threw out the cd. The cd is evolved around the single ""jay's song"" which is the best sounding tune on the disc. The simplicity of the writing is great. The hooks are there with a little cheeze that gives them a commercial sound. Compared them to 3 doors down, weezer, and nickleback."
4,Amazing Shampoo,"This is a very mositurizing shampoo. My sister has very dry hair and she has a lot of damage from styling and she recomended it to me last winter. I have very fine hair so I was only able to use it once a week or so, but it really helped keep my hair healthy through the winter months."
5,Real bargain,"I have been using the Kotex Lightdays Pantiliners,Extra Coverage for about three years. They are comfortable and keep underwear from getting stained. Getting six boxes of 80 liners per box for one low price is a definite bargain for me. The added attraction is that the liners come to my door, saving me time and gas. I checked on price of six boxes at Walmart with sales tax and Amazon.com is cheaper especially since there is free shipping/handling."
2,Not good at all,"These are definitely not the same as they used to be. I was finally done with my 6 pack of Lightdays long and bought the 6-pack of this thinking they were the same, just different packaging. I loved the older version - cotton (not any horrible plastics like other brands), longer than standard liners... But unfortunately these newer liners are a disappointment. First, the size is NOT longer than the old long size (though Kotex's description would lead you to believe so). Same length, and a bit wider thus making them too big. Second, the edges are not comfortable at all. The edges are not soft or smooth like they used to be. After wearing them for an hour or so they irritate me. So not only do I have to trim them to FIT so they don't dig into me (sharper edges making it even worse) I also have to so all of the edges don't irritate me. When I'm done with this 6-pack I will not be purchasing again. Will need to try again to find an alternative."
4,I like 'em!,"I've been using these for a few years already. In speaking to Tsten's review: I hear ya! They're not the same as before; I miss the previous version of this product, too. That being said, I still find these to be soft without shredding easily. The grab on me is that these little pads have really pulled through beautifully for me when having a menstrual ""accident."" Sorry for the TMI, but I say so to impress upon you that these are still rather comfy (not plastic-y against me) and very dependable pantiliners. I also can't find these in a big package at a store, so I get them here."
3,same but wider,"These are the same as the ones I was using, just a little wider. I assumed more coverage meant thicker. NO big deal!!! Still a good product."
3,OK intro to Bettie,"Pretty nice overview with kitsch thrown in all over it about the iconic chick who steals hearts after 50 years and even in death, Bettie Page. Her life -an especially her other contributions- are plentiful, so start around here, look into the Cult Epics DVDs including their own DARK ANGEL bio, and choose how much you want to know from there. And really, it's all kitsch anyway, and rockin'.Twenty zillion Bettie fans can't be wrong. Welcome to the fold."
5,Asimov: a brand of his own,"Isaac Asimov(mhrp)is a never-fail brand name. While some of his science fiction becomes dated as science itself advances, his wide, eclectic vision has not. This is a rich commentary/guide to Shakespeare's works, and a never-fail reference for those wishing to bone up on the bard before attending a play or dropping bon mots in cocktail conversation."
5,For the novice as well as knowledgeable scholar of the Bard.,"I bought my old edition of Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare at the Southern Oregon Shakespearean Festival bookstore some twenty years ago. I have used the text to prepare my neices, nephews, and grandchildren for their first experiences with live performances of the tragedies, comedies, and romances performed by the Ashland repertory company. Asimov's narrative includes just enough Shakespearean diaglogue to allow the novice playgoer a glimpse of the richness of language, wit, and perception contained in each play. That glimpse is all my young pupils needed to attend (in all senses of that word) their first plays at age 10 and to keep attending these twenty years. And Asimov's insightful interpretation of each play has kept me reading him as well as the Bard as I prepare to introduce a second generation of children to great threatre. I am ordering a new copy of the book, as my old one has been worn out."
4,Chockfull of interesting analysis of each play.,"This book is a dream come true for any Shakespeare addict! The massive volume covers each and every play in great detail giving the vital statistics on historical background, characters, plots,sett- ings, etc. The sections on all the history plays were worthwhile and fascinating."
5,Brilliant and funny,"I love going back and forth between the text of the play and the Asimov commentary. He provides excellent historical context for both the events of the play, and for the events in Shakespeare's time. And he has a great sense of humor."
4,Excellent Reading!,"My only complaint about this book is that Asimov gets too strong in some of his personal opinions. (Harsh opinions of Banquo, Brutus, Richard II etc.) But aside from that I value this book highly. He helps us to see some things Shakespeare's original audience would be able to pick up on WITHOUT being told. This helps one to understand Shakespeare's plays more. Also for the most part he DOES avoid the absurd marxist views that tend to over simplify the anaylisis. He is especially helpful in the history plays. Understanding Shakespeare's historical plays depends to a large extent on knowing the facts that Shakespeare does not mention (but that the original audience would have known). He also offers educated speculation that offers deep insights. While I do not agree with him on EVERYTHING, his views are interesting."
5,Azimov on Shakespeare,"Isaac Azimov's Guide to Shakespeare is insightful, educational, controversial, well researched and fun. This is an excellent, alternative interpretation of the Canon. Anyone who wants to understand the history, the mythology and the drama of the plays should read this book. Highly recommended."
2,Super Reader,"While Conan of Venarium is readable enough, the boy band reject on the cover, and the scence of Conan chopping the vegetables in the kitchen alongside his ailing mother are all rather incongruous, and I am sure I am not the only one that feels that way.Alternate history may be Turtledove's thing, but not much place for it here."
1,"Run Harry, Run!","I used to be a BIG fan of Turtledove. I would give his books to friends just so they could enjoy him also. Then along about the middle of the Great War series I got bored. I even tried a couple of his other series just incase it was the series I was bored with. Nope. Tripe. When I saw this Conan story my interest was piqued. I've been a HUGE fan of Robert E Howard since the late '60's and will read anything about Conan (Robert Jordan wrote the only Conan stories even close to REH). I have to tell you I wish I had NEVER read this book. Bob Howard is waiting for Harry Turtledove in the Void and the things he will do to him will make all Howard's monsters and villainous wizards seem like baby kittens and playground bullies. Run Harry, run."
2,"New cover, same songs.","Although I welcome any new release by Hazell Dean, I must admit this ""new"" CD is somewhat disappointing. This album consists mainly of a selection of the recordings that were released on the 2002 Greatest Hits album, along with a few from the 1995 Best Of collection. There are NO new songs here at all. The 2002 recordings are NOT the original versions of these songs (if you want the original versions I recommend the 1995 Greatest Hits (EMI) which is a very good collection indeed). This, sadly, is a low-budget production and sounds like one."
1,an A.M. sound,"This is the most mediocre cover from original songs ever, Changed the original PWL bass,hard drum and clap+bell as Dead or alive sound to an awful a.m. radio quiet whisper. Sure do not recommend to buy, its a first grade children music. yuk !"
2,Does an okay job on some things...,"I was lured by the idea of not having to buy lint roller refills ever again, but it seems that this lint remover is actually very hit-or-miss. It does pretty well with lint and pet hair on the couch and other solid objects, but taking the cat hair off of my sweaters and jackets it another story...it just doesn't quite get the job done. If your main concern is upholstery or some other fabric-covered item, this is a fairly good product for that, but traditional sticky lint rollers may give you more bang for your buck."
2,Difficult to use!,"I found this article difficult to use as it keeps rolling over if you don't grip it very tightly! Also, there is a strange odor to the block. I haven't washed it yet so the odor might dissipate. More later....."
3,first one had a seal problem,"I love how it looks and feels. It's a small, stylish watch, that goes with about anything.. except water. I immersed it in water while playing with my 2 year old, and sure enough, there are large drops of water inside, and the dial is all fogged up. And this is just 1 month after buying it :( I'll have to see how the repair/exchange will work out...Ok, watch was exchanged and the new one water tested. Apparently that one had a seal problem. I'm going up to 5 stars for the watch :)"
5,"Beautiful, stylish, tough watch","I recieved this watch in December 2004, and wear it every day. I'm pretty rough on watches, but this one has lived up to everything I could possibly do to it. It is comfortable, very stylish, and I get many compliments on it. My only complaint is that the clasp is easily unclasped sometimes. Maybe not the best clasp design. Otherwise, I highly recommend! I've been swimming, take showers with it on, and it's even gone through the wash without so much as a fog on the inside of the crystal. The crystal is still completely unscathed as well, which still surprises me. Great watch!"
5,I AM HOOKED!!!,I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I AGREE WITH THE OTHERS IF U LOVE TO READ GOOD I DON'T WANT TO PUT IT DOWN BOOKS THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE TO PICK UP. THIS BOOK IS OFF THE HOOK. IT KEEPS U GLUED FROM THE VERY FIRST PAGE. I AM SO LOOKING FORWARD TO READING SINCERELEY YOURS I AM ALMOST FINISHED THIS BOOK. EACH PAGE LEAVES ME WANTING MORE AND MORE.
5,OFF THE CHAINS,"Saadiq knew what he was doing when he wrote this book. I never read NO EXIT, but after reading BLOCK PARTY I definitely have to pick that up..BLOCK PARTY was a page turner, I did not want to put the book down..Cashmere and mayor were some interesting characters..My favorite character of them all though was Slim...He was a deep old head....He taught Cashmere a lot......I have to say that this was the best street novel that I have read in a while, and I pick them up all the time....BUY IT NOW"
4,Hot book,"Block party was a cool read. Cashmere and ""The Mayor."" I felt the characters and will give the word out. I gotta read ""NO Exit."" Now."
4,GREAT BOOK,"I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS A GREAT STREET NOVEL MR BANKS DONE IT AGAIN IF YOU LOVED NO-EXIT,YOU WILL LOVE BLOCK PARTY, I CANT EVEN IMAGINE HOW MR BANKS COMES UP WITH SUCH GREAT NOVELS BUT HE DOES! THIS BOOK HAS SO MUCH GOING ON.CASHMERE,AND MAYOR ARE SOME CRAZY CHARACTERS ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS,THEY KNOW HOW TO MAKE MONEY, AND NOTHING WONT STAND IN THEIR WAY OF GETTING IT. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD BOOK, YOU HAVE TO PICK BLOCK PARTY ITS WORTH IT."
4,Excellent for graphic artists,I found this little book to be just what I was looking for in the way of Egyptian graphic designs for use in my jewelry work. Many interesting black and white designs to choose from.
3,Egyptian designs,this book is filled with mostly black and white pictures. if you are getting this book to use to draw egyptian designs keep in mind that alot of the designs are very small and hard to draw and the bigger ones are even harder because of all the details. however it is a nice book to look at. but if i were you i'd wait till it go's on sale
3,I purchased this to explore different textures/looks,"While it is watermarked, I was not particularly impressed with the granite texturing. Just feels like a dull perhaps even dirty matte gray. On the other hand I found that the ""Linen"" style Southworth paper has a more luxurious high end textured look to it.Southworth Fine Linen Paper, 25% Cotton, Size 24, Ivory, 500 Sheets (564C). And the color is a true Ivory unlike this WausauWausau Paper Vellum Bristol Cover Stock, 67 lb, Letter, Ivory, 250 Sheets per Pack (82361)which turned out to be a manila yellow. I plan to try the Linen texture in gray to see how it works out for printing, envelopes etc..."
1,This film was Dumb,"This movie tried way too hard to be hard core. If this movie was a high schooler, it would be the poser kid, who tried to fit in with the thugs by carving crap on his arm with glass, before going to class. Then ended up in the ER because he got a staff infection. And what is up with the main villina, Justin. His eyes look like he had bees purposely sting him before each scene."
1,"It's all right, 'cause we're Saved By The...","C'mon, some kid scams a profit from a staged classroom Stock Market assignment? This is a plot device that some corporate, network ""brain trust"" deemed weighty enough to float an episode of ""Saved By The Bell"". I can not IMAGINE a more fitting testament to the intellectual vapidity of this After School Not-So-Special. And I can imagine Exploding Ninjas and Robot Zombies!"
5,Midsouth Recommended!,"I think Down to Earth is the best cd by Midsouth or The Mid South Boys I have heard yet. All of their cds are great but I would rate this one above all the others I have. The songs carry a very clear message in each one. Midsouth is one of the best Country Gospel groups I have ever heard, they have great songs and music. I definitly recommend this cd to anyone!"
3,Buy this book just to read 'Blood and Kisses',"Although the erotic scenes were good in all the stories, I only found Angela Knight's story of 'Blood and Kisses' believable. I never questioned why a character or situation occurred and felt I read a 'complete' plot. I plan on reading everything she has written."
5,More than worth the money!,This is the best Secrets Volume yet. Blood and Kisses (an erotic vampire story) makes the book worth the money all by itself! Not to downplay the other entries in this Volume. All EXCELLENT!
5,Rare find these days,"This album has been in my collection ever since it's original release way back when. My collection is quite large and have been slowly collecting some of the old stuff in CD format that I have on vinyl such as this one. It took so long for it to come out and nearly gave up and forgot to check. Now I found it while searching for ""Zone"" DVD's and discovered that it's out of print it seems! Wow from one extreme to the next and nearly missed finding it. One reviewer mentioned one song in this CD ""why was it even on there?"" In fact, that very song was the main reason I wanted it. ""Nights Are Forever"". It was the song playing in the night club when Vic Morrow walked in. It was not a mainstream song in the film. But I liked it so much. I was very pleased that it made the sound track."
2,Jerry Goldsmith's The Twilight Zone: The Movie,"Only purpose to buy this soundtrack is because I'm a Goldsmith fan and collector. Not his greatest work, the movie was a flop! Worth having if you're like me, just put this special and limited edition with the rest of his great collection. Jerry Goldsmith still remains as the best film scorer of all time in my opinion. But this CD does not reflect that, too bad."
4,Goldsmith's music elevates an average film!,"The producers of the trouble-plagued ""Twilight Zone-the Movie"" can be satisfied with one of their decisions: the hiring of legendary Jerry Goldsmith as leader of the baton. He, like fellow composers John Williams and Elmer Bernstein, belongs in a class by himself, with few even meeting him (or them) halfway....the album is short (45:20), but a little bit of Goldsmith goes a long way. The highlights are the scores from the segments ""Kick the Can"" and ""It's A Good Life"". There are some recognizable Goldsmith touches but that does not lessen their impact or beauty.It just shows that one has a trained ""Goldsmith ear"". Any fan worth his/her weight in gold would be able to discern Goldsmith's style from another's."
5,Worth the 17 year wait.,"As a fan of Jerry Goldsmith's music for most of my 28 years, I have waited over half of my life to get this soundtrack. I'd almost forgotten about it, assuming it would never be released. But, here it is, and in its entirity and original form.So was it worth the wait? I'll say. I really wanted it for the scores to Segment 2 (""Kick the Can"") and Segment 3 (""It's a Good Life""), and to finally here it in such quality is fantastic. The sweeping, waltzing score for ""Kick the Can"" is vivacious and moving, while the music for the cartoon nightmare of ""It's a Good Life"" is fantastical, scary and at times surreal, capturing perfectly the mood of the segment. There are only 8 tracks listed on the CD, but several of these are almost 10 minutes long, so don't be discouraged by appearances.This CD is the original orchestral/synthesiser orchestra recording, not a re-recording, and comes recommended to all of Jerry Goldsmith's fans and film score-philes alike.Wonderful."
3,Vauge,"While the dart manipulation ideas are great, the instructions are too vague for anyone just starting out to understand. Sometimes they wanted you to try a harder method than what my teacher suggested, and she's the one that told us to get this book! I'm looking for something that makes more sense to designers just starting out."
4,for class,I bought this for a class. Teaches great techniques for flat pattern. I ended up keeping the textbook for future reference.
3,"Cute, but lacking deep thought","Although relating many topics such as government, society, metaphysics, artificial intelligence, and other topics, this book (to me at least) fails to comment on any real deep philosphy. Upon the discussion of artificial intelligence, Hofstadter completely ignores the notion of emotion in AI, and ignores more specifically the emotions of greed and lust, that drives many people (such is the reason why if AI were to exist, man-kind would cease to exist.)He also fails to mention the notions of religion, and its implications to self-reference. In his discussion for Tit-For-Tat, Hofstadter also fails to mention that Tit-For-Tat is perhaps the most unrealistic scenerio in life, since many game winning algorithms exist. In essence, it is a thought provoker, but in the sense that it would be compared to a good crossword puzzle, while a real philosphy text would be paralled to solving a tough mathematical proof."
4,One of those books,This is one of those books (like GEB) that you could own for a lifetime and refer to at random and always learn a new tidbit or be taken on a new tangent. A book that feels like being in someone elses mind (again like GEB). Excellent and worthwhile. I give it four (instead of five) stars only because the truly great books take you into someone else's mind and leave you thinking it was your own...
2,"4"" Black leather cushion",Too tall for a short person and not comfortable. Foam cushion that they gave us at the hospital was more comfortable than this. I believe it would make a good archery target though!
1,Big Disappointment,"I needed a seat cushion addition to my desk chair at work. My chair doesn't seat me high enough to keep my elbows/shoulders from hunching on the armrests, which result in shoulder/neck pain. I thought from the product description that this would be perfect to add a few inches of height. When I sit on this cushion, it compresses on one edge. I stand up, rotate the cushion and try it again. Again it compresses. It is not firm enough to hold its shape. I do not recommend it and wish I hadn't bought it."
4,overlooked era,These guys span an overlooked era in pop-rock history.They go from doo-wap to the British invasion to the Vietnam draft era.Tremendous harmonies combined with great arrangements are agood listen for anyone. They do great impressions of their rival vocal groups also.
4,BIGGER TALENTS THAN THEIR RECORD SALES,"Probably because they took on an early repuation as a novelty group, the richly talented Four Preps made some terrific,but often overlooked music for their time. Their collective sense of humor and brilliant mimicry of the acts of the late 50's and early 60's enhanced what some might describe as a mediocre success record. I dare anyone of any generation to listen to ""26 Miles"", ""Big Man"", ""Cinderella,"" or several others on this well-packaged collection and not wake up singing their tunes. One more thing: As a lover of the ORIGINAL Kingston Trio, I laugh every time I listen to ""More Money..."" Their impression of the Trio's Bob Shane coughing during the song would miss most folks....but I loved it! Unfortunately, The Preps' later material departed from the original sound so much in an attempt to salvage some radio air time,so the quality suffered.But,still well worth the money and ""More Money..."" for this Preps fan."
1,THIS SHIRT IS A TOTAL RIP OFF,"this shirts quality is absolutly horrible, just like the yankees, this shirt is a total piece of junk."
5,"A ""MUST READ!""","Definitely helpful in everyday face-to-face interactions, not just for public speaking. I originally read this book several years ago, and it made such an impact on me - the ideas were very logically presented and I put them to use immediately. My communications skills improved immediately, as well as my social life. When I saw this book offered here, I just HAD to buy it! Do yourself a favor, buy it, read it, and put its concepts to use. Your life and relationships will improve."
5,Speaker/Former Journalist: If You Get Only One Book Get This One,"Bert is a trailblazer presenter who has trained a cadre of colleagues in his firm - all to help diverse others hone their speaking skills. And he never keeps learning as this book demonstrates. For practical, specific and original insights about how to become an authentic, frequently-quoted speaker, get this book. I bought two for my job-hunting nephews"
5,This CD IS SWINGING!!!!!!,I LOVE THIS CD!!Part 1 is verry good(The songs are short but the time they do play is awsome)Part 2 is my favorite (J.J. In Person) I like that it is live and the solos are GREAT!! I Love how the cornet and trombone play together in Walkin'. Misterioso is also a really neat song and the cornet solo is cool.Then J.J shows his beautiful side in My Old FlameThis CD is a MUST HAVE!!!
4,Nostalgia,"In the fifties, when I was a teenager, I had a vinyl recording of Jay and Kai + 6. I remember passing around the album with my friends. As a trombonist myself, I was awestruck by the Peanut Vendor arrangement. Everyone had a favorite. Unfortunately, when the record found its way back to me, a trumpet playing friend of mine had left the record in his car, and the sun had warped it. Now I am going to order a new one. I can still hear the clear, vibrant, staccato tones of eight trombones calling to me from long ago. I know that I won't be disappointed"
3,looks aren't everything,"i've lusted over this bag for quite awhile,and finally bought it.although it's georgeous, it weighs A TON!!!!!even with a minimal amount of stuff in it,it's like carrying an overnight bag.i don't think i'll be using it as an everyday bag,it's too heavy."

1,Buyer Beware: Defective Product!,"I purchased two of these to help organize the wiring of my large salt water aquarium. After about a month one of the units literally caught on fire and burned up one of the switches. I contacted the manufacturer and they admitted that they had sold and not recalled a bunch of these units that had the switches not wired through the fuse. They offered to exchange for another unit, but wanted me to pay shipping after they had caught on fire! Who knows if I had exchanged them if they wouldn't be defective too. I threw both of these expensive mistakes in the garbage and promptly bought name brand units and have zero issues since."
3,Quality Issues,"I mounted this under a shelf in my workshop and use it to switch various chargers for power tools and batteries on and off. It is just what I expected and looks very durable. The lighted switches are a big plus. However, I have had problems with two of the switches. One would not switch on, no light or power to the outlet. After about twenty flips and a few taps, it started to work. Another switch was on and remained lit even in the off position. The solution was the same.It could be the switches just stick a bit when new, or they could be of low quality and prone to failure. Only time will tell."
3,Fair.,"I had this strip for about three months before one of the toggles stopped working. Happy with the rest. Fit perfectly into a 19"" rack and took up 1u.UPDATE. ON 9.15.2012. One toggle just fell apart. All the pieces hit the ground.Now I have 2 switches that don't work. One an empty space and another a dead light. I've only used the power strip in rack mount system in my home studio.I hope there is a better quality product out there or American DJ gets its act together for this power strip. I am very very grateful that I did not have this installed on my road gear!I just replaced both broken switches at 5 bucks a pop. You can get the rocker switches on amazon.Amico Red Light DPST ON/OFF Snap in Boat Rocker Switch 16A/250V 20A/125V AC 30x21mmby AmicoChris A."
4,DJ PC-100A 8 Channel Power Strip,American DJ PC-100A 8 Channel Power Strip with Lighted TogglesI needed a mobile equipment rack to house the synthesizer and speakers so that they could be moved around conveniently and deployed easily. I built a rack to house the equipment and needed a way to provide power to the various components and organize them. The power strip was just the thing and at the right price. So far it works great.
4,strip review,"I have yet to actually use the strip but so far I give it 4 stars, would have been 5 but one of the corners was bent which was a easy fix with a pair of pliers but when I buy as item new my expectation is to not have to do work to it...I will update once I use the the strip"
3,Not satisfied,"I bought this for my ever growing studio power needs. It arrived in what appeared to be an already open box. I thought about returning it but, I really wanted to get my studio up andrunning so I didn't.I really like the way it lets me isolate what stays on and off. It fits perfect in my desk rack.Just two problems:1. Rocker switch number 5 won't shut off.2. It's just over 30 days since I received it and can't return it.Other than that, it seems like a nice piece of gear."
2,DJ PC-100A 8 Power Strip,"Received the power strip in excellent external condition. Quickly put the strip to use and found that two of the switches did not work correctly. Upon further use one of the switches started functioning properly and the other is still not working. Hopefully it too will start working. I purchased the strip for use on my aquarium for the various pumps, lights and heaters and it makes maintaining the aquarium much easier and faster. I really like the functionality of the device but am not impressed with the quality control."
2,2 switches already broken,"I received this on May 15, 2011. I use it to power my home audio equipment. The second switch just broke, and it doesn't get very hard use. I'm going to spend a little more next time, and hopefully be able to rely on it."
1,Power Switcher,"This item is a total piece of crap. The switches (which power on the ac plugs on the back) fail extremely quickly. The first failed within a week. The second within a month and then others have failed subsequently over the past 10 months. All this unit is supposed to do is turn power on and off like light switches. Monumental Fail. Also, attempting to have it repaired or replaced has proven impossible. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM, IT WILL FAIL. (since my purchase I've learned of SIX other units by this company that have done the exact same thing) TOTAL CRAP GEAR, NOT WORTH A DIME."
1,Breaks Easy!,"I bought this, set it up with my system and it worked the first time I turned it on. The problem came when I went to turn it off, the channel 1 on it is stuck on. I plan on writing to American DJ about this and hopefully I receive a replacement free of charge! I will post back as a comment when they get back to me."
1,ME TOO!!,Two of my 8 switches no longer work. Will let you know if I lose anymore. A real shame--would be excellent in computer room.
1,220V is a Lie,"I purchased this item because I live in a country that has 220V power. I receive it, ask their staff how to set it up for 220V operation and am told that the specifications are ""incorrect"". Oh, and they apologized for any ""inconvenience"".So, if you are thinking about buying this because it says it is rated for 220V, DON'T. It's a lie."
4,...,"Excellent product for the purpose that it should perform. I opened mine up, since I couldn't get my cable in one of the outlets. Well, it should be at least $10 bucks cheaper than it is..."
4,not just for DJ's,"I purchased this product for our Networking lab at work. we wanted to controll power to individual components of the lab without having to open the lab rack up entirely. This is actually the second unit we purchased to expand the number of selectable devices. The first unit was purchased 8 months ago, and used almost daily for testing scenarios. i am a little disapointed at the 1 year manufactures Warranty, and the quality of parts. I figure we hammer this unit harder daily than any DJ will on a weekend gig though. we had to send the original unit in for RMA as 3 of the 8 rockers had failed after 8 months. no fuss though, and the unit was back to us 10 days after we shipped it out."
4,Very good product!,I bought this when I needed to upgrade my surge protector. I know this is NOT a surge protector but when I attached it to a new 2500 Joule rated surge protector it afforded me a way to connect all my peripherals. It's been a great convenience for me. Great product.
5,"Great product, great price!","This is my second AC power strip from American DJ. Having used the 4 channel version before for many years, I can certainly recommend them and say that they are well worth their meager price. Hope my new 8 channel strip will be as reliable as my old one. So far, so good. Keep in mind, however, that you may still need a power 'conditioner' as well since these strips do not clean up your electricity or offer much protection against AC spikes."
1,Many busted switches.,We bought a bunch of these for racking 100's of set-top boxes. About 50% of the switches had a non-functional switch right out of the box. Have not had any problems with Eliminator E 107.
3,Down 2 Switches,"Had this for 2 months and two switches have already failed. But when it was working it worked great, and even though I'm down to switched there still enough for me to put on my light show."
2,20A Power Strip from American DJ,I mounted this 1U strip in my road case to supply power to a multitude of hardware. The rocker switches are solid and illuminated when active. The unit supports up to a 20 amp load via a standard grounded 3 prong 120v plug. The spacing on the outlets is good for just about any wall wart you may need to put on it and each outlet is clearly labeled so you get the right one. I guess my only complaint is the length of the cord. It would have been really nice to have a 20' foot cord but considering the price I can't complain. EDIT - One of the rockers stopped working on the 3rd week of use. I will call the manufacturer for warranty replacement.
1,Don't buy this,"I'm on my second PC 100A, and this one is so cheaply made I had to write a review. I have to smack the buttons with the butt of a screwdriver to get them to turn off. What happened to this product? Somebody is saving money and screwing the consumer. I hope I can find a similar product by another company that is actually functional. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!"
5,Get's it done!,Absolutely excellent customer service! Truely lightning fast shipping! Product works perfectly and is very easy to use. I have ordered two. I use them to control all of my reef tank equipment and pumps. Perfect for the job!
3,Might as well stick with Jedi Academy.,The fighting is the same as jedi academy which is good. But this game compared to Jedi Academy is boring. Which by the way if ur looking into buying this game don't. Buy Jedi Academy it;s way better i promise!
3,COOL,When I first got this game it was so much fun!Later I got Jedimod and it became sooo fun!But as I played it more and more it got more boring...
2,amateur-ish and full of mistakes.,"Full of mistakes, mispronounced names and missing many more interesting locations.This may be an interesting view for those who are simply channel zapping, but for anyone planning a trip to chile it's mostly worthless. It shows very few of the main attractions in chile, and for those it does show, there are either mistakes or omisions of facts that need to be known such as: rodeos are only held around the 18th of september, cerro tololo observatory is far from being the biggest in the world and a trip to the juan fernandez or easter island is outrageously expensive. The author is notably uneducated about what he is visiting and could have read all the information given from a travel guide book like lonely planet.In a single phrase: Look elsewhere for useful information."
3,Atom Nine,This was a fairly well done sci-fi movies that was worth the watch. It is what I refer to as hamburger in that it satisfies the consumer without making a real impression on them.
1,"Atom nine, an atomic Bomb","Poorly written, poorly acted. Must have been a very low budget film. I watched it in sections waiting for it to get better.At least it had a happy ending!"
3,"Ayyyyyyyyyyyy, ok","Pretty bad, but lot's better than a lot of stuff they put out today. Much better than a lot of stuff produced today."
2,Cheesy,Was way to easy to guess what was going to happen next. Needed way more depth to storyline. Characters were shallow. The dialog wasn't even B movie grade.
4,good bargin,"I bought this product for my wife. She says for the money compared to other perfumes this is one of the best,"
5,The best perfume around,I don't understand why the retail stores stopped selling Sicily in the United States. The last time I purchased it was on a trip to Aruba. I am delighted that Amazon carries it.
5,Delius review,Listening to this cd brought back fond memories of the Elderhostel program I attended in January in St. Augustine at which we were introduced to this composer who lived in northern Florida for a time and was inspired to write several pieces based on his experiences there. A beautiful composition that seems seminal to works by Copeland.
1,"Tiny Book, Don't bother",My wife ordered this book & didn't look at the page count. This is a tiny book (size of a childrens book) not worth the money.
5,get any of Thieme's books FREE at www.rbthieme.org,"This book, as all books by R.B. Thieme Jr. is an incredible book by an amazing man. But there should be no price on this book as he never puts a price on any of his study materials as that is incompatible with grace. All of his books and audio materials are available free of charge by writing toR.B. Thieme, Jr. Bible MinistriesP.O. Box 460829Houston, Texas 77056-8829and requesting a catalog."
4,different direction,"This mix finds Oscar G going in quite a different direction than Live at Space, switching from house with progressive leanings to house with a strong electro influence. He doesn't use high bpm, popular vocals, or flashy tricks to move you, just an insistent groove that doesn't let up until it seeps into you."
2,Dissapointed by one of my favorite Dj's...,"Ok, to be honest Oscar G. is one of favoite dj's. I was their for the grand opening party for Made in Miami Sunday's @ Manision and it was absolutley insane. I have all of his mixed CD's including one of my all time favorites Oscar G. Live @ Space. But, This CD does not come close in comparison to hearing him live. Both CD's have a slow electro feel that tend to go nowhere. Leaving me feeling anxious for something more. I listened to this CD a number of times hoping it would grow on me, but it never did. Please do not judge Oscar G. as a Dj based off of this mixed CD. He is a great DJ and a very talented artist. This just happens to be a very bad release. My suggestion is that if you don't own Oscar G. Live @ Space already, then definitley go out and get it. The CD is filled with bangin tribal and each song is worked incredibly. I hope this helps."
4,Good Clarinet CD,I own lots of clarinet CDs and for a budget brand this one is good for the collector.
3,Dissappointed,"I like the shirt, but the picture shows it as a light blue/grey shirt. It is dark blue/navy. Either way the picture color is not nearly as dark as it really is."
5,Everything in one place,"I bought this for our condo which has limited storage space. It's right in the front hall, is nice looking wood, and keeps everything organized. Our clubs, shoes and balls are right there, ready to go!"
5,Not bad for decaf,"I bought this product because it was a cheaper alternative to the Senseo coffee pods I've been buying. I don't have much to compare with, but overall, this decaff tases fine."
4,Very good coffee at an excellent price!,"I decided to try this coffee when I saw how much cheaper it was than the Senseo pods but I didn't hold much hope for it being better. To my surprise, they are full bodied and rich for a decaf. I do find the taste a little bitter, but not enough to make the Senseo a better choice. I like my coffee strong and these are definitely up to my standards."
3,"Probably worth having, but not as good as others","This is a good, but not great, Stan Rogers CD. There are some really compelling songs, like Cape St. Mary which, while a bit slow, is heart-rending at the end . There are some catchy songs, like Badger Drive and Two-Bit Cayuse. But there are some rather tedious songs too. All in all, it is worth having if you like Stan Rogers music, but it probably won't be as much a favorite as say, 'Home in Halifax' or 'From Fresh Water'."
1,Cheaper elsewhere,"Well I like this show, I discovered yesterday at target that you can buy season 1 and 2 there for five dollars each."
1,Damaged DVD,I wouldn't know if it is good or not because the DVD sticks and jumps ahead. I tried cleaning it twice with no luck.
4,Can't stop laughting..at first,"My husband and I watched the whole series a couple of episodes every night while eating supper. The first couple of seasons were quite hilarious, but then it seemed to slide into nothing but sex. Such a shame, it was such a novelty."
3,Buyer Beware!,"I bought this set solely based on the ""Life Has Been Good To Me"" number because I wanted to see it in 3D. (I had previously seen the clip on the internet.) I was quite disappointed to find that this glorious number had been cut at the beginning and end. So the people who have complained that these are the syndicated (cut) versions know what they are talking about. I feel like the product was misrepresented and I am considering returning it. The cuts in the shows make many of the transitions very choppy. I wish I had read all the Amazon reviews before purchasing this."
4,JGL b4 the big screen,The whole cast was very funny and nice to see JGL before he made a real name for himself on the big screen.
1,Works great...,"...at returning my white towels to their natural color, which, I assume, must have been black/dark gray. It also colors my white countertop blackish. But as for my hair, not so much. I've heard mention that this stuff penetrates the hair and combines with your natural blah, blah, blah to restore your natural hair color. This cannot possibly be true, or I would not have black towels every time I wash and towel dry my hair. This may darken your hair (and anything else you spray it on) from the outside, just like spray paint would, but my hair is not changing color. The smell is unpleasant and the texture of my hair is even worse. This is a big disappointment."
4,It works,I think it's a very good product my hair is turning black gradually and there are not side efects like itching
1,Just a bluff,This review is from: Verseo GrayBan Anti Grey Solution 6.8 oz. (Misc.)I purchased the product from verseo. Label with improved product packaging and results in 3 days. I used the product for 3 months and did not see even one white hair changed color. I turned to the company and they even did not respond as expected. Do not buy this just a fraud and waste of your money.
1,The odor is pretty awful! does hair texture matter?,"I am an African American. Before purchasing this product I contacted the company and asked would it work in the same fashion for your 'typical' African American hair texture. (i.e., ""kinky) and they said yes.I have used for OVER a month now and have NO significant change in hair color and the smell is God-awful!!!My girlfriend complained that she has a hard time with the smell also, so I know its not psychological.I am more dispapointed by the smell than i am about the effectiveness, because nothing is 100% foe everyone. the smell though is mentioned specifically in their ad as being odorless.Very unsatisfied customer."
1,Bad for my hair,"I really regret trying this. I used it faithfully every day for 30 days, and I didn't see any change in my hair color at all. I have nearly-black hair with about 25% bright silver hair coming in. What I did notice was that my hair became drier and drier, and more and more brittle. So I stopped using it. It's been 3 months now, and my hair is still incredibly brittle and thin. My shower drain clogs every day with all the hair I'm losing. It's probably going to take at least a year for it all to grow back out."
2,The sulfur smell is overwhelming!!,I used this product for about 10 days. I didn't see any real change but I couldn't last for the recommended 4 weeks for the full effect. It Stinks to much!! The smell is so overwhelming that I had to give it up. It goes on with a pleasant smell but gradually builds into a powerful sulfur smell. It follows you around all day. My bathroom smells like sulfur this morning just from washing it out of my hair. I don't know how anyone lasts a full 4 weeks with this stuff. If you use it at night be prepared to throw away your pillow. I was wondering why I had never heard of this product before and now I know why.
1,Doesnt work,"All this product does is slowly """"paint"""" your hair, but it washes right out when you wash your hair. Anotherwords, your hair only stays lightly colored(not even fully) till you wash your hair. To me, it seems like it colors your scalp more than the actual grey hairs.A waste of money. A complete rip off."
5,ROCKIN 'N' ROLLIN BY BUDDY JOHNSON,"I have been looking for ""I'M JUST YOUR FOOL"" for FORTY YEARS, I never realized the whole CD would be so GREAT. They don't make music like this anymore. Thank you Amazon for having my kind of music. I have bought other great CD'S from you and will continue to do so."
4,Underwhelming,"If you have Walk 'Em....well, you have to decide. Walk 'Em's elements of groove, musicality and lowest-common denominator appeal are held in an almost-Mozartian balance. This combined with the excellent sound makes that CD a must. It made me want more - and...this CD is more - and less. Nothing here is on the level of such tracks as The Stuff You Gotta Watch or Root Man Blues. It's good enough. But rarely hellified. The instrumental A-12 is the best cut. Caveat Emptor."
5,We Love This Game!,"I played Rigamarole for the first time with my Mother and a group of women I had just met. We had a great time playing and we were all laughing and carrying on like old friends by the time we were finished. The game is played with teams of two or three (or more) players and it's a great way to get to know your team members as well as everyone's talents.I especially liked the variety of challenges Rigamarole presented. No one player dominated all of the categories, and each team member found she excelled at something. This game is the perfect follow up to a dinner party."
2,Save your $$$,"This could have been a real fun, simple, straight forward tennis game but the control keeps it from success. The cartoony graphics are old-school but well done and fun. I suppose with some effort you could get used to the timing and collision but its just not intriguing enough to encourage that type of investment. A-1 games has the right idea for producing quality budget games but this one falls short of the net."
1,no good,this gane has horrible graphics and i havent played it since i got it. it is not realistic to tennis
3,Simple Fun,"This game is really simple compared to anything that comes out of EA Sports. No options, no saving, no creation of your own players. But it is quite a blast to play, especially two player. It's hard to get used to the timing and position of the players but once you do you can kick your friends butts!pz"
1,The Perfect Game,I think it is the best game in the world an its great and it's wonderful and entertaining and a must buy
5,"Super safe, extra long for bigger babies","This carseat has been terrific for us. Our son is now 10 weeks old and at his two month checkup was 14 pounds and 24 inches. Two more inches and he'd be too small for most of the other infant carriers. This allows him to be a bit bigger when we start using the infant-toddler seat. The padding on this seat is great, and the ""boot"" (which snaps firmly to the seat) keeps him toasty warm without the need to bundle him in so many layers of clothes. With all of that, it is a pretty light seat. We frequently get compliments on it, especially from parents of taller, bigger babies."
2,Not So Much on Retirement,"This may be considered a good book if you're interested in reading the memoirs of intellectuals and former activists. I was looking for practical advice on preparation for retirement. Instead, this book is filled with a bunch of women reflecting on their yuppie, professional lives and personal histories. Most of the women drone on with self-indulgent, narcissistic drivel. There are a couple of interesting stories (like that of Ms. Carol A. Scott) and in between some of the blather there are some startling statistics and interesting facts. But overall, this book has very little sensible advice on retirement, and I feel I've wasted my money."
5,Like a Sandwich,"Like a sandwich of which the two slices of bread are more nutritious than the jelly in between, the best parts of THE SUFI MYSTERY are the first chapter by Siddiqi and the Afterward by the editor, N. P. Archer, who writes, ""That there is a 'law' of the deterioration of learning and of schools of spiritual subjects just as surely as there is a 'law' of the decay of organisms seems as good as proved from any comparison of the still widely extant Sufi classics with some of the extravagances reported in various papers here [in this very book!]. The reader is forced to decide for himself."
5,Beautiful from Beginning to End,This album is a breath of fresh air. It is amazing from the first track to the end. One of the best albums I've heard in years.
4,Nice & Smooth,"I really like this CD. I discovered this artist by accident and wanted to hear more of her. I really like her style. It's smooth, and jazzy. I play almost the whole CD. I would highly recommend her music."
4,Not as good as her first CD,I am a Goapele fan I enjoyed this CD but I was not able to listen to the entire CD without skipping. There are two songs that I really don't like and therefore I have to skip to the next song but overall I have enjoyed this CD.
3,Goapele's latest,"Goapele is a beautiful woman who probably has a great spirit, but she is blessed that God gave her such looks. I think that without them, she would not make it as far as she has, as is so for many entertainers today. I was intrigued with her debut song, Closer, and always wanted to hear more from her but had not until this album. I was dissapointed with her vocal skills, but the production of most of her tracks on Change it All is great. She has that neo soul, politically conscious thing going on. I just think the girl cannot truly sing. She has horrible rifts and does not ad lib very well. She needs some vocal coaching."
2,She's over-rated!!!,"Goapele's voice bothers since she came out with her first single closer. I think she has a great stage presence, but her songs are not creative and are not revolutionary. They are very safe in my dictionary.Nothing has changed! She can not change a bit."
2,Boring Neo soul,"She has a decent voice&some interesting subject matter,but on a whole there ain't much here that holds you.marginal songs at best.diem a dozen.not One song that truly knocks me out or stands out.the chick is a Knockout,but Musically for the most part just aight!"
3,Changed It All,"In 2002 I heard Goapele for the first time. I looked high and low for her album and fell in love with it. When I heard that she had another album coming out I could not wait to get it. I even went to hear her live in hopes to get a preview. However, when I did get this album, I was disappointed. I feel like she sold out for the almighty dollar. It did not have the same feel of her first album. I felt like she was writing from her heart and trying to please only herself on the first album. However on this one, it seemed as if she was trying to please everyone else. I hope that Goapele can find her way back to her roots."
4,Goeapele is one of the beautiful species in danger of going extinct!!,"Goapele is one of the few artists who go to the studio not trying to figure out what is selling in the market but instead pushing herself to deliver the type of music that will survive with time.When I saw the video clip ""First Love"", I said ""Eureka"" coz I had discovered a soulful and mervellous artist. Her style is close to Shade's or Jill Scott's but with some kind of sensual and erotic ingredients which makes her special... Goapele is definitely a divine creature and buying Goapele's album is like protecting all species that are in danger of going extinct!!"
4,great album,ignore the numbnuts thats trying to hold GOAPELE the musician accountable for a dispicable label tactic....she cannot help it and more than likely encourages people to share her music and spread it so people will hear about her. Goapele is the angel voice for west coast hiphop supergroup Hieroglyphics (like Joyo Velarde is for Quannum.) Her voice is beautiful and the production is great. There are better albums out of this style (Anthony Hamilton's new album being one of THE best) but this one is still REALLY good. don't listen to the haters...buy and love........
2,"Please Change More...Or Less, Just Don't Stay Here","Goapele has a so beautiful voice, but frankly I think this album ruined it...I don't have a feeling of Soul at all, it's contemporary R&B or something else?"
3,Please take your time.,"I first heard of goapele when i saw that she was to open for floetry this past spring in san antonio, texas. I bought the album and hoped it would sound exactly or very similar to floetry. I was completely wrong. The first couple times i listened to this album i didn't really connect with it, but after watching her live I started listening to the cd religiously. This cd is a great album it has to grow onto you. I was not fully appreciating goapele's album because i was to busy hoping for another band to replicate the floetry sound. Goapele is wonderful and this cd is worth your time. I would dedicate some time to getting into this cd if you haven't had the chance to have her first album certainly try this one. You will come to love it in the long run."
4,"Sometimes there are no happy endings, just endings","Reality sucks but not without a bite first. This indie is, to me, a stand-out among gay cinematic achievements because of its brilliant script and its non-fairy tale type of ending. In the stark reality of life, there are beautiful moments that do not necessarily lead to happy endings. Sometimes love is meant to be savoured in that one miniscule moment and then it's off beyond one's reach. How do we deal with it? We just do.I certainly enjoyed watching it and would gladly recommend it."
4,Weekend from Criterion Collection,"Bittersweet, but still a love story worth watching, offering a different perspective on the development of love between two men. Absorbing - worth the time - I've already seen it twice."
3,The Movie was Not Quite as Good as Expected.,The seller shipped this DVD on time and it arrived in good condtion as described. I was disappointed in the movie however. It wasn't as good as some of the review I had read. I wouldn't recommend it. I thought it was slow moving and the story was a little boring.
5,Sincere,"I thought this movie practically vibrated with clear simple sincerity. The characters were completely believable and it became almost beside the point that the two male leads were just so attractive on screen. These two male leads in their own distinct ways have so excelled at their craft as to produce a film which is about love, not same-sex love, but love..Very well done indeed! Highly recommended."
2,Not what the reviewers claimed.,"As others have said, I bought this with great expectations.First, the sound quality plus the thick accents made it nearly impossible for this Anglophile to understand 70% of the dialogue without repeatedly re-running bits. Even then, many lines are impossible to decipher.The overall plot *should* be engaging, especially for gay men, but neither the characters nor their story was compellingly told.I did go back and re-watch the last 15 minutes, because that's about when things get interesting enough to care. Otherwise, a bit of a dud.Oh- the guys are half-way decent looking."
1,DVD not readable in France,"the film is excellent as I saw it at the cinema, I wanted to have it at home but it is not readable on my blueray disc player. I want it in original version with English subtitles to follow the dialogues."
5,Incredible,This film represents how it really is. I saw this a few months back and was amazed at how accurate and on point it is when it comes to gay relationships. No posturing or posing about this. I've never seen a truer description of two guys falling in love.
4,Indie doesn't mean bad,"I watched ""Weekend"" on telly during a special ""Gay weekend"" on one of the movie channels. To my surprise, it deserved all the positive feedback it got.Two guys meet, sleep together, but what is more important, TALK. Talk a lot. Spend time together. It's just a weekend, but it can be a beginning of something very serious.True to life, isn't it? It sounds like one of my own stories.Happy to see that low budget enterprise can be so fruitful!If there is one thing that I didn't like, it were the drugs involved here. Is it really so gay to take them every Saturday???"
3,"Uneven, but gets better as it goes along","""Weekend"", a love story about two men (Russell and Glen) who meet, share a couple of days together then part, has its moments. Unfortunately those moments don't come until well into the film. The first hour of the film is tedious and boring...I felt no sympathy to either of the main characters. The sound editing is very poor and the dialogue banal. But at one point the two men are sitting with each other in a chair discussing gay marriage and that's where ""Weekend"" begins to pick up. When Glen has just hours to go before moving to America, the two share many tender moments and the final scene at the train station brings the film to a satisfying conclusion.This could have been a much better film in many ways, but it's worth a look. If one can get through that first hour, then stick with it to the end."
4,Great Golden Oldie,"Oh Honey was worth it alone, but the rest is pure ""old-school"" and makes this CD among one of my favorites."
4,earrings..,"Cute earrings. However, they're much more lavendar than blue. That's my one disappointment. I didn't thinking I was buying purple earrings."
2,These heel pads slip around too much,"Sorry, but these heel pads slip around in my shoes and will not stay put in the heel area of my shoes. I am using Spenco orthotics PLUS another full sized Spenco insole to give attitional padding in my heel area which works well. The heel pads seemed like a good idea, but without using some glue (which I have not tried) they do not work."
1,Useless,These are useless if you suffer any kind of heel pain. Save your money and invest in stretching exercises or proper full-length inserts or custom orthotics.
1,Sickening. It should never have been published!,This book is a disgrace. If Paul Finebaum wants to write he should try something different than slandering coaches and colleges. Indiana University is an excellent college. Bobby Knight's players graduate!!
1,this book is pure dribble,"this book is pure dribble and should have no buisness being published. in fact the whole series is innane and should stop because the books are an insult to football programs everywhere. Finebaum is inconsistent in his books,writing books about both teams from major rivalries and showing nothing that tells us he is educated. the only one of these that should have beenwritten was the purdue one"
1,Please don't cut down more trees for this trash,"A trash book, pure and simple. ""Boilerblotto"" below is typical of Purdue fans..."
2,dsl modem,"I purchase this unit hoping it will work. Well, I got it without an installation disc of any kind or not even an instruction. How would I use it without the proper support?"
3,OLDIES BUT GOODIES,"WHEN I PURCHASED THIS ITEM I WAS REALLY LOOKING FOR ONE SONG ""IN THE MORNING"" IT TURNED OUT THAT ""THE MARVELOWS"" HAVE A FEW OTHER SONGS THAT I WASNT HIP TO BUT NOW AM ENJOYING LISTENING TO. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF OLDIES BUT GOODIES, DOOWOP, OR OLD R&B YOU'LL ENJOY THIS CD."
1,It broke!,"I received this as a gift and I LOVED it! I already have the mouse. The keyboard was very slim so the keys didn't take much to push them. That took some getting used to but I LOVED it! And then one day, not even a month after I got it, it just didn't work. I turned my PC on, trying to do the Ctrl+Alt+Delete thing and it just didn't work. I tried plugging it in to other PCs with no luck. I plugged another keyboard into my PC and it was fine. So it was definitely the keyboard. Unfortunately, I did not send it back, keep meaning to, so I have no feedback on the customer service. Will update if I ever get it done!"
3,Meh. Ok i guess.,"Well, it looks really good, the color is perfect. Thats about all I can say that is good about it. It is awkward to type on, the buttons all work, but it is uncomfortable, and just feels like an inferior keyboard. The keys are too close together or something, and do not grip your fingers well. Great looking, but bad for typing."
5,So Cool!,I bought this as a present. It's very cool and everybody loves to look at it! It works just as good as any other name brand keyboard.
1,Battery died before first use,"I took this out to use, and first of all could barely figure out how to change the settings... but the battery showed it was low when i turned it on the first time. I couldn't find a replacement anywhere... so I gave up. Shame, because it looked promising."
4,It does it's job,"It says it's an 8 second thermometer, which I guess it may be. It seems like it takes longer than 8 sec for the temp to come up. It does it's job tho, for the price I can't complain."
1,Junk,"This thermometer can take longer than the 8 seconds and the temperature reading reads very very high, 100.5 was a norm. It did not read accurately at all, and I would not recommend this product."
5,Excellent!!,"I've unfortunatly had to use this recently for the 1st time. It's so easy to use!! I've always been scared to use a thermometer rectally but I wasn't nervous with this one at all. The reading was very quick and easy to read. It saves your last reading so you dont have to try and remember what it was last time to know if your baby's temp is better or worse. It also has a backlight on the screen so you can use it in the dark, which is nice if the child/baby is sleeping and you dont want to turn the light on and wake him/her up to take their temp.And I LOVE the way to folds up inside itself so you dont worry about loosing the cap or cover, which I always do.This is a quality thermometer and especially for the price!! So easy to use and much more accurate than the ear thermometers (dont EVER buy one of those, theyre a complete waste of money and dangerous to your baby by being so inaccurate!!)"
5,"Great, simply put.","I like that it folds up, takes ONLY 10 seconds to get an accurate temp and has been reliable for 1+ years. I use plastic covers over the end that I find at Walmart."
3,Important Design Flaws,"What I do like about this thermometer is that it seems to take fast, accurate oral readings. fast is crucial since young children often like to fidget.Where the unit has significant problems is in its functions and poorly written instructions. Unlike most other thermometers, this one can't be switched to take reading in Centigrade. Also, although the mechanism for the termometer folding and storing inside of itself is a novel idea, the unit is not constructed well enough so that you end up bending the tip when it is inserted for storage and constantly worrying whether it will break or not.I would give this thermometer a miss and stick with one of the others available on Amazon."
1,Horrid! Scaired us over and over,"We ended up chucking this last week and i wanted to be sure to warn others. It was all over the map thermomoter wise. It would say 100 when we thought she was slightly hot, so we'd get out hte 'freebie' from the hospital and it' would then say 98.4. Oh, since we were nervous we'd then get out another one and do the same thing and it would then say right around hte 98.4. Unfortuantely, this was not the first time it had done this to us. Save your money! We invested in the ear thermometer scan hospital grade from braun. holy goodness. piece of mind. it's worth the 50!! you figure you'll need one thermometer per kid with this type, the ear one is for hte whole family. Yeah, I'm sorry I spent the 12 originally and tried to cheap out because this caused way to much worry."
1,cdrum,"I tried using this thermometer under the arm of my 3 month old son, then orally on myself and him, and finally rectally on my son, and it was not at all accurate with any of these methods. I called the number on the back of the package, and the company sent me a new one which I promptly took back to the store with my original receipt. I then bought the Braun Thermoscan ear thermometer which I like for myself but find unreliable for my young son. It doesn't hurt to try and save time, but for my household, I've found that a simple, B-D digital thermometer with disposable covers used rectally is the most accurate method (and therefore easiest in my opinion) for infants. Maybe they've had some bad batches of thermometers in this production line (noticed some good reviews amongst the bad), because I generally like products manufactured by Safety 1st."
1,"Gravely inaccurate, belongs in the trash can.","Gravely inaccurate, regardless of the mode of use. No way to re-calibrate it. Not worth the hassle of returning it. You get what you pay for, really."
5,Works just as described,"We LOVE this thermometer! We had been using the freebie digital thermometer we'd received from the hospital for months and months getting a lot of exercise literally dancing for my son's entertainment that he'd not cry and squirm too much during the minute it took to read his temperature. I had looked at a bunch of forehead scanning thermometers but between the reviews and the price they didn't seem accurate or worth the cost. So I thought to give this 8 sec thermometer a try and have truly been thrilled. By the time my 9 month old son realizes I'm holding down his arm the thermometer's already beeping. and it has always been accurate on me under the arm so I trust it is the same for him. Well worth the extra money of other digital thermometers, and a steal compared to high end ones. I highly recommend it."
4,Perfect but gives reading in fehrenheit only,"The reading is perfect, I compared it to a traditional thermometer. The only bad thing about it is that it gives the reading in fehrenheit only."
5,Very accurate,"My son is 4 months old and I've used this thermometer at least 10 times and found it to be very accurate. I don't know if the other users are taking into account the fact that you need to add and subtract a few degrees when using it rectally, orally and underarm. I've heard that the ear thermometer isn't accurate for infants, but is better for older children. I think this one is great for infants."
2,cannot get rectal temp with it,"this thermometer beeps when it is done taking the temperature and works fine under the arm or orally. but, for some reason, when done rectally, it has never beeped to let me know the temp taking is complete - it just shuts itself off after 10-15 seconds. very frustrating as i'm trying to get newborn's temp to know if i need to take her in or not and i'm never assured that i'm getting an accurate reading. for oral or underarm it is fine."
2,Worthless,I agree with the other reviews. This thermometer is worthless! The readings are inaccurate and you really are better off just taking a wild guess. Do not spend your money on this thermometer!
1,Do not buy!,"My wife and I have only tried to use this thermometer under the arm, but it is not accurate. It usually gives readings that are ridiculously low (93-94 F)unless I preheat it by holding it for 20 seconds. It only displays in F, and my wife would prefer Celsius."
5,refreshingly candid,"As a Christian Scientist, I appreciate the scholarly analysis of the social and intellectual climate of the times in which Mary Baker Eddy lived. He has done an excellent job of explaining the problems she faced in the context of the times in which she lived. I found new insights in his book. Such thorough scholarship requires some effort on the part of the reader."
4,Good,"The helmet is good, and meets the OSHA requirements. The only thing that I don't like about it is the fact that the OU logo is a decal."
5,Great!,"I can't believe that I am only now discovering the music of Leo Brouwer. His music is sophisticated, yet highly accessible. He manages to mix virtuosity with lyricism in equal parts. The performer Ricardo Cabo is also a real find. He is amazing. Lastly since this is a CD put out by Naxos the quality is high and the price low."
5,Teacher Resource,First of all this version of Anne Frank is by far the best casted and portrayed. The characters are easy to relate to and the storyline flows easily. My students are in middle school and they were enthralled by the movie. The interactive activities were relevant for my ELA class and provided some great discussion. Overall I strongly recommend this video with interactive DVD to any classroom teacher or parent.
3,"K. Braxton, Mechanical Engineer","I have beeen using AO Safety Face Shields for many years. I like the fact the you can replace just the shield, rather thant the whole unit. The shield is easy to use and if you are careful with it, not to scratch it, it last a good while."
1,hose ready to burst,I purchased this item March 25th so unfortunately I just started using it living in Boston I had to wait for the weather to warm up. I have used it now for about a month and there are bubbles thru out the hose do to the pressure build up. My previous hose never did this I just changed hoses do to wanting a red hose to go with my non functional fire hydrant. I would not recommend this hose and will be going back to my origanal hose do to the fact that it is over the 30 days I am sure I will not be able to return it. I would not recommend this hose!
5,Best TV radio!,"The Sangean Sonido radio is a great product! You get 4 TV channels, AM/FM and weather alert and they come in perfectly clear. Sound is great! The only trouble I have is keeping a hold on the channels when I preset them, turn radio off and later turn it back on. But it doesn't take any trouble to reset them! Great for listening to TV and news while you're doing dishes!! Shipping was fast too!"
4,Solid,"I bought this radio to use primarily on weekend camping trips. Overall it is great little radio. The sound quality for a 3 inch speaker is top-notch. It only gets distorted with the volume near max. The features are easy to figure out even without instructions. The materials are of high quality. The only beef I have is that the AM reception is not as good as other Sangean products I have used. It is good, just not great. The FM reception is above average and very clear. Also the battery life might be the best I've seen in a portable radio. Four cheap D batteries have easily lasted two three-day trips.When at home we use this as a kitchen radio. It's small footprint and aux. input have proven to be very useful in this role. I love the weatherband features, particularly the standby alert for severe weather.Overall it has proven to be a solid radio that serves it's purpose very well. I would strongly recommend this product if you are looking for good sound quality in a small, well built package."
4,Big improvement over other radios here,"Bought the radio because one here (another brand/type) broke. Have a very high interference environment for AM broadcast band, and need a better quality radio to escape intense buzzing sounds from fluorescent lighting. This radio was a huge improvement, much clearer and more crisp. As a result I listen to it a great deal more than the radio which broke"
5,Sangean Sonido Radio,This has to be the best portable radio ever. It runs AC/DC and is small enough to be easily carried around. This is the second one I've purchased - this one for a gift. I highly recommend it because of the excellent clarity of sound and ease of use.
5,Excellent Blackened Death/Thrash,"This album is an excellent example of great death/thrash metal with some black metal mixed in. Even though it was released in 1996, it sounds like it is straight from '89 - '90. The riffs are catchy, yet fast and brutal. The sound is very similar to early Merciless and is just as good as 'The Treasures Within'. In my opinion, this is the best Occult release, but 'Prepare To Meet Thy Doom' is a close second. I came upon this band after listening to their later releases, now under the name Legion Of The Damned."
4,Great game for small time!!!,"Battle Hunter is a Role Playing Game with turn based action. The game is in the near future when more than half of the world has been destroyed. Scientists can bring back the destroyed areas if they can get their hands on certain items. You take on a hunter that searches for the needed items in dangerous doungeons. Thiis sounds so simple, but it isn't. There are also other hunters, some with you, some against you. But in the end, the only thing that you can rely on is that you can't rely on anyone. This is a fun game. It doesn't take to long to beat, but still keeps you interested. Cheap price! Have fun!"
1,Corny,this&the Whole World are where Outkast has kinda lost me for a minute.I still think they are Talented Cats but these Last two Songs are too Corny for me.but I think they can bounce back.
4,Nice body spray,"This body spray has a fairly light scent, not so overwhelming like some body sprays. It is light enough to layer with your favorite perfume, I've used it with several and it blends nicely with each of them. I also like that the scent has enough staying power, you can still smell it many hours after applying."
3,Vanilla Body Spray,"I am a lover of Vanilla but was a bit disappointed with this ,will go back to using Coty Vanilla ."
3,Not a first choice,"While these symphonies are played competently enough, they are seriously short on inspriration and energy. The playing's decent but lacks anything special. It's like the orchestra came in and said ""Arrrg...Beethoven again. Well, we're getting paid."" There are so many better recordings that this one can be avoided."
4,Beethoven: Symphonies Nos. 4 & 7,Beethoven: Symphonies Nos. 4 & 7 is a recording under the direction of Bela Drahos who leads the Nicolaus Esterhazy Sinfonia on a Naxos recording from 1995. The recording is not bad but it lacks the amazing sound quality that Harmonia Mundi and the like have. For an unexperienced listener this will suffice but for a connoisseur like myself it lacks the little extra. Still I can recommend it. 4/5.
2,NOT HIS BEST,"'Glad she's a woman', and 'Watching Scotty grow', are not badsongs while 'Honey', 'Autumn of my life','The straight life',and 'I'm a drifter', are outstanding. The rest of the songs onthis album are terrible and in this regard I can only agree withMichael C Vanier except this is not Goldsboro ""at his best'.At his best Goldsboro deserves to be brackted with John Denver,Neil Diamond, Garth Brooks, Billy Joel, Barry Manilow and PaulSimon to mention a few. If you listen to his albums HONEY (1968),WORD PICTURES (1968),TODAY(1969),WE'VE GOTTA START LOVIN'(1971) AND SUMMER (THE FIRST TIME)(1973) you realise thata lot of good songs are missing from the above-mentioned album.Rather get his 'Hello Summertime'album or better still his'Honey/Summer(the first time)' album both which make a mockeryof this album been the best of Bobby Goldsboro."
4,bobby goldsboro - honey,"good old memories of the good old times. nothing is the same or even close any more. too many cell phones, obsolete every week!"
2,Disappointed,"This was a gift bought for my mother. I can remember hearing her play the song ""Honey"" night after night when my father was overseas during the Vietnam war. She called me a few days ago and said the quality was poor. With todays technology there is absolutely no reason for this."
3,Bugs Video,"One good disk out of 4; the first disk had lots of classics, the other 3 were waste, but still, we watch the first disk a lot."
4,No Speedy Makes Better Collection,"I panned the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume Four since it contained an anusually large portion of useless Speedy Gonzales toons. I was pleased to find that all the 40s-mid 50s jems of that collection to be contained in this Spotlight Collection. It was nice to be given the choice. Whoever chose the ""picks"" for the Spotlight Collection did a pretty good job. A star removed for not including 8 Ball Bunny, Southern Fried Rabbit and Plane Daffy."
1,8 TUNES?????,Yep - Time Won't Let Me was one hell of a tune - still sounds good today.Bur 8 tunes on a compact disc that holds 79 minutes? Get real.
3,Not thought out well,"While the pictures look nice, it is very difficult to get the desired results. My 16 year old son carved the big ""G"" with ""Packers"" under it. The ""G"" is not supported well enough and collapses. It was also difficult to cut out the fine carvings due to the kit only coming with the larger tool. He used the tool from another kit we had and it was easier."
2,too complicated,The designs on this one are way too intricate and the tools are not sharp enough to get the job done. We kept losing parts of the pumpkin and only got one to turn out.
4,Good review book,This book condenses all the information learned in one year very effectively and clearly. Excellent for review. I only wish the Disc had more test questions on it versus most of them being in the book. This book is excellent for people taking the MBLEX since it does not ask much in the way of eastern theories. If you are taking the other version of the test I would recommend something else with more eastern theories review.
3,"Not what I needed, but made it work","I purchased this for a college course as it was not available in the campus bookstore. When I received it I was a bit upset as it does not have numbered lines, like most copies of this do. I found a way to make it work, but it required a lot of extra work on my part. I couldn't send it back because we received such short notice to get it."
1,May be good but no need of it,I plant onion and garlic in garden. Keeps all the ghosts away. No need for shift and incantation.Thank you.
4,Some interesting information,"I did not actually read this edition. I read the Seventh Edition, which was published in 1923. Thus it considers the tariff history of the US up to 1923. Taussig makes a lot of sense when he discusses tariffs, and his discussion shows that ordinarily the Democrats had a sounder position on tariffs than did the Republicans. Does anyone know of a book which would cover the tariff question from 1923 to the present? Reading the seventh edition of this book made me interested in reading a more current evaluation."
2,Disapointing,The game was overall very disappointing. The gameplay was repetative and clearly lacked any substance. Even the title on this one is misleading. A game that is best avoided.
3,Super Reader,"A plot involving artificial earthquakes, more than one man named John Acre, both supposedly the same, a spy and her brother, and the nitrates industry in Chile, which is where this adventure ends up.The Little White Brothers have dictatorial ambitions, and controlling and industry will fund it. Two agents named Velvet and Biff try and interfere with Doc in New York, and his record based answering machine helps him out, after his finishes the operation that restores sight to Johnny's bad eye."
3,Ehhh...,Not that informative all around but it does make some good points. This topic has been covered much more thoroughly in other docs.
1,not satisfied,I was not happy with this product. Description should have been more specific. I was looking for a CD and this was a tape...not happy at all
4,Resonable Purchase,Not what i expected but may be my expectations of a thin wooden spatual is too much to ask as i havn't seen any product at any price range. Works well for what u pay
2,Disappointed in quality after 1st use.,"Got these to replace an old wooden spoon we have that was starting to wear out. The tall spoon chipped after just 1 use of stirring soup. Have not used the others yet, seeing as they are cheap I won't bother with trying to return them, but I did have promising expectations after reading the reviews. I just had mention my experience with them. I put up a photo of my spoon with the chip on its very first use."
4,Bamboo rocks,"I love bamboo. It is strong, beautiful, and an environmentally responsible resource. These utensils are straightforward so there isn't much to say about them other than they have the benefits of bamboo and I feel free to stick them in the dishwasher."
3,"Cheesy quality, though low-priced","Well, what can you do? It's only six bucks, but still... the bamboo isn't finished very well; really needs to be sanded, or sanded more thoroughly. Also, the spoon had a small slit in the surface, and I was afraid it might end up turning into a real crack and therefore useless. So I returned it."
2,looked better in pictures,"I have to say that these looked better in the pictures. For the price, I was expecting a heavier duty set."
3,Love bamboo but questionable finish,"I picked up this set at a regional Home Goods store. The utensils are very nice, usable sizes and shapes and I do love the color. But what I don't like is the finish. It looks like shellac. (Please note the product description claims a naturally-occurring finish created by heating the utensils, but I can see on mine where there are drip marks that appear to be from a spray-on finish so I would say that is not the case.) Of course I don't know exactly what they used, but I'd prefer natural bamboo. I don't like to potentially add an unknown, possibly toxic finish to my food. Another reviewer suggests sanding but I probably won't go to that much trouble BECAUSE I found the perfect use for the long spatula: I have no other way to apply moisture lotion to my back after showering. This spatula works like a dream!"
5,A Must-Have!,"I love this stir-fry set, though I have to say... I've NEVER used it for stir-frying! I've used it for just about everything else in the kitchen, though. Even the shorter rice paddle has come in handy for all sorts of things (it's fairly flat, so you can even use it like a spatula). Also... It's sooo cheap! I feel like I should order a few more sets, just in case. I've already gotten it for friends and family to throw into a Christmas stocking or to wrap up with a cookbook or pan. The best part: they are dishwasher safe! I've washed mine over and over and have never had a crack. Awesome product."
5,Great bamboo cooking utensils,"These are some nifty cooking utensils! For the price ($7) they can't be beat. Each utensil is of a different length and shape, giving you a good variety to choose from. I've searched high and low for wood or wood-like cooking utensils that came ""sealed"" and these are among the only good ones I've found. Since they are burnished they won't absorb whatever food you are cooking, and best of all they are dishwasher safe! What a great find!"
3,"Fine, especially for the price",These are not what I was hoping for. They feel very light which I know is normal for bamboo but they are even lighter than other bamboo tools I have had. Also the shape is just a little awkward for me. The quality seems good though and I will continue to use them.
2,Think again. These are very thin pieces.,"I don't mind thin wooden utensils, but these are very thin and smaller than I thought they'd be, which suggests they won't last long before they need to be replaced. I can buy better at Wal-Mart, sadly. Joy has let us down with this set. Skip it and find better."
1,Gave me a splinter!,"I ordered this product based on the good reviews and low price. I should have known the product was too cheap to be any good. The first time I touched this product which was to open it and take it out of the packaging to wash, I got a splinter!!! It's not made well and the edges are not smooth. I don't even want to touch the product anymore but since I already bought it, my husband wants to use it for a few times before we toss it. The spatula and mixing spoon are a bit on the short side in my opinion. I'd rather spend more money on a higher quality product. I really do not understand how this item got such high reviews. I noticed that many of the reviews are quite old, from the 2006 era...maybe the quality of the product has changed since then. Stay away!"
1,Not First Quality,"This is my second set of this product,, the first set I purchased from a hardware store in Texas. And I loved them. This set from Amazon is a second quality, they are not made with the same quality as my first set, there is a flaw on the back of two of the spoons, the finish is rough and the edges are misshaped on one of the spoons.The price was good but I did not know I was getting seconds till I opened the box and saw them."
5,Sturdy,Well made & I cook with them at least 5 days of the week. Easy to clean. And I use them even with my cast iron cooking ware. Would buy again.Note: It took too long for shipping. C'mon guys...I'm still waiting for orders I placed in May. Way to go Super-saving shipping??!!! I think I'll start paying for shipping if it means I don't have to wait for two months.
4,Works for me,I wanted something that I could assure myself would not be used in gluten containing dishes. These do the same thing as other non-bamboo utensils. Work great for me.
4,Nice set,It's anice set of bamboo stirrers. They take a little getting used to as they are heavy and thick and therefore not as flexible as nylon or steel would be.
1,Very disappointed,I regret buying this product. If I had had a chance to really look at the calendar first I would not have bought it.The biggest problem that I have with this problem is a major problem- I can not write on it with ball point pen reliably and I worry that other kids of pens would smear. I don't want to have to use a special pen for it.The other big problem is that the squares are too small.I am not a fan of the way it is dated. I am somewhat disappointed by the lack of cute graphics. I don't really mind that the questionnaire portion is the same every month because it is neat to see how things change as baby gets older.I am on amazon tonight so that I can buy the same calendar I had when my oldest was a baby because it was much better (Baby's First Year by Russ).
2,Try her nonfiction works,"Nancy Hale wrote for magazines such as the New Yorker, and her memoir work is fine sophisticated writing. As a fiction writer she was less sucessful. Skip the fiction, but if you see Life in the Studio or A New England Girlhood at this point probably only available used grab them. Hale was the daughter of painter parents and a descendant of Nathan Hale. She was born around 1900. Her memories of Boston and New York as a child and a young deb are to be savoured."
3,A Community in an unlikely place,"Imagine watching a remake of the hostage classic ""Dog Day Afternoon"" by the filmaking team Merchant/Ivory. ""Bel Canto"" presents a story which is at times a taut hostage drama, and at others an insighful meditation about community, love, and other forms of human relations.Maybe some of the plot twist are farfetched, maybe the narrative slows to a crawl for a short-time before the emotional and action-packed finale. However, the characters have plenty of depth, the romantic sub-plots are moving, and all details are charmingly observed."
2,Trashy romance novel disguised as literature.,"What a disappointment this book is. It starts out promising, the premise is interesting, but it soon deteriorates into something on the level of Jackie Collins. Even if you can ignore the numerous grammatical errors, as the plot develops it becomes increasingly implausible and unbelievable, and the Soprano herself is not even a likable character. But ultimately, what really destroyed the book for me was the incredibly *ridiculous* Epilogue.I have read Ann Patchett's other books, and I do admire her writing style. And somehow, even in my disappointment I felt compelled to finish the story. I suppose if one goes into the book liking and expecting nothing more than a cheesy romantic fantasy, this book would be fine. It just did not meet my expectations in the least."
1,Slow story,"I read many books on my own and with a book club. This was a book club choice. I did not like the book or the story. It was very slow reading and there were too many details , too much character discussion. And the ending was really poor."
1,"On your list of novels to read before you die, this should be #5,167,810","In order to find the time spent reading Bel Canto worthwhile:1) This must be the first novel you've read2) You must have a maudlin passion for maudlin passion3) You are willing (and able) to check any expectations of realism at the front endpaperHow else could a reader accept the artifice of ""terrorists"" entering a residential structure through air conditioning ducts, unless they are 6-8"" tall? I should have stopped reading here, but my curiosity at how this trite, poorly-researched tale could end up in print got the better of me. ""There must be a hell of an ending,"" I thought. Suffice to say that if this unfortunate disaster were plotted based on its banality, the ending was the climax.Possibly the worst book I've ever read."
2,Major disappointment,"After receiving several recommendations I wonder if I need new friends. The best I can say about this novel is that it's easy to read. I had difficulty with the two-dimensional characters, syrupy writing style, and bizarre ending. It has all the complexity of a made-for-TV movie."
2,"Nice idea, but","I was excited to read (well, listen to the audio version) of this book. I'm a big opera fan, and thought it sounded interesting. It could have been, but in the hands of another writer, I think. The story dragged, and as much as I liked the idea of an opera diva being one of the main characters, Roxanne Coss never seemed like a real person, and the adulation of her by almost everyone in the book got old real fast. I was bothered, also, but the audio version's mispronunciation of several operatic terms.The ending was unsatisfying, as if the author had decided who would end up where, and couldn't figure out a way to make that happen, so snip, snap, a couple of quick, unlikely deaths and we are on our way!Overall, the book seemed to me to be a book that was trying really hard to be important and great, but never achieved it."
2,Surprise ending,"This is my first review ever. . . . that ending surprised me in a way that really put me in a quandry. That ending came from beyond left field. It made no sense to me at all. Perhaps if a relationship was initiated following the deaths of their loved ones I could foresee a possible connection and in time, a relationship. There was nothing to warrant this and although it was so written, for me it was not believable. It felt more like an afterthought."
2,You can't write a novel telling of a voice,"The synopsis of this book caused me to believe it would be interesting...however, Patchett has centered her book on one of the most unlikeable characters I have ever come across. If I have to hear the author gushing about the beauty of Coss' soprano voice again, I think I am going to tear my hair out."
4,"Poor timing, well written","My wife and I read ""Bel Canto"" in the middle of 2001. It's a beautiful story, with sharply-drawn characters and surprising complexity.I found the book easy to read, my wife did not. The difference: 9/11. I read the book before, she read it after. It's ironic, because while Patchett's book is based on true events, it seems untrue, a fairy-tale perhaps, now that we have all been made aware of the true horrors of terrorism. One recoils now from a lyrical love story set among hostages...That being said, a good read. The parallel love stories are captivating, and one cannot help but think of magic realism while reading this book. The ending is a bit harsh but has a ring of truth to it -- I won't spoil anything -- but Patchett's last chapter interestingly undermines the conventions of the love story."
2,So much potential.,"I read the first 160 pages, which took forever, and the last chapter, and I got pretty much the whole story. At first I thought the book was sophisticated and intriguing, but it took so long to get to the point that it turned me off. The end was out of nowhere and left many questions. This IS your run-of-the-mill, ""people get taken hostage and then you learn about their sordid lives."" Not to my taste at all."
1,Why???,"I just didn't get it. Why? I found the characters uninteresting and bland. The ""terrorists"" were a joke - sitting around playing chess, watching their Soap Operas and letting a bout of the Shingles take over their face! Everyone falling in love with the Diva, all the hidden talent -- one a concert pianist -- another a closet-Opera-singer!!! Please!The Mel Brooks connection below is right-on -- I also thought of A Weekend at Bernies! The story-line was ludicrous - the ending Absolutely Implausible! Why the two that ended up getting married GOT married -- I'll never know!Bad book . . . Bad!"
2,Gag Me,"I'm about 200 pages into this book and I am bored to tears. I doubt I will finish it. I'm so sick of hearing how everyone is in love with the opera diva, Roxanne Coss, over and over. Just the sound of her voice mesmerizes everyone, brings people to tears, makes them want to leave their families, etc.etc. Ok, she's pretty, she can sing, does she also have magical powers?? The descriptions of her voice and the effect it has on the listener are so ridiculous and heavy handed. I don't get it. The hostage situation just goes on FOREVER and nothing ever happens. This book just d-r-a-g-s. I don't get the rave reviews for this boring, boring book."
3,"A Great Story Line, Not enough action",The story is interesting but it seems to drag on too long without enough action. This is book I would recommend as an average book.
4,An aria of aura,"This book has a magnificent setting, exciting plot and fascinating characters that face an extraordinary set of circumstances; all of which gives this book an epic depth."
2,Wish I had read the customer reviews first,"I was so glad to read Laura Harvey's comments on this book (and some others) because quite frankly, I have heard nothing but great hype for this book; that it is so wonderful, etc. and I definitely did not ""get"" it. Honestly? I thought it was boring. I started to hope the so-called terrorists would start killing some of these people. I agree with Ms Harvey that I could not think of anyone to recommend it to because it is impossible for me to imagine someone that would enjoy it."
4,Good story...great writer...,"I thought ""Bel Canto"" by Ann Patchett was a really good story. I also think Ms. Patchett is a great writer. Very colorful in her worded description of things. It takes a lot of talent to make someone feel as though they are a fly on the wall during a play-by-play in a story. Ms. Patchett did exactly that for me. The reason I gave the book four-stars instead of five was because I didn't exactly agree on a few things in her story, not meaning I'm right and she's wrong, it's just a different point of view that I see (captor v's captive.)"
5,Gorgeous Book,"When my mother recommended this book to me, saying that it was about an opera singer and a bunch of diplomats who get taken hostage in South America, I was less than enthused. But I was without a book at the time, and I decided to give it a shot.This book is gorgeous. I have no better word for it. The character development, the way the relationships grow between the characters, the care and detail that go into the descriptions of the music...Patchett has such a gift for bringing her characters to life. Please don't let Oprah's seal of approval turn you away. This is not a ""chick book."" This is prose at it's finest."
4,Bel Canto,Difficult to read in the beginning but picked up and was hard to put down! Reader became attached to both the hostages and the terrorists. The last chapter was a shock - I doubt anyone expected that outcome!
4,Journey of the Soul,"Beautiful, well written story, reads like a grand opera...unusual, melodramatic, overreaching, exaggerated, and exquisite all at the same time. This story is not action packed by any means, but more a journey of the soul. Easy to read, but very complex. LITERARY OPERA is a perfect definition of this story, as one Amazon reviewer stated. I felt the power of the music affecting me, changing me, and bringing me closer to my heart, much like it did for the characters in the story. And to think, I was not listening to actual music, now that is PURE MAGIC. I think the poor reviews are by people that failed to understand the beauty and purpose of the story. 4 1/2 Stars"
2,So-so,"A friend chose this for our book club selection and although I really wanted to just abandon it, I did end up finishing it. I didn't find the story line to be super interesting or compelling and I didn't care much about the characters who were, at times, difficult to keep straight. There is a lot of detail left vague and the ending is somewhat predictable. It wasn't so bad that I refused to read it but I did not enjoy it and would not recommend it others."
4,Worth Reading,"The book was entirely absorbing, but I found the end to be disappointing, contrived. Not enough, however, to prevent me from looking to see what else Patchett has written."
3,Bel canto,"I read the book because it was a book club read. I'm not sure if I would have chosen it myself. The book held my interest most of the time, but it dd get bogged down some of the time also. I think the most interesting aspect about the book was the psychological exploration of each individual character, showing both the ying and the yang of their personal situation."
2,Slow and boring,"I found this book very boring. It is extremely slow paced and none of the characters -- Roxane Coss, Mr Hosokawa, Gen, Carmen, etc are impressive. At some places, it becomes too descriptive and it is not that I don't like the descriptive books but this one just starts getting even shallower with the description. I found it hard to finish it but as I knew that there was suspense in the end I waited until I got to the end. However, the ending wasn't exciting at all. I wonder why this book has gotten such good reviews."
3,Hogan's Heros updated,"The soft, sentimental terrorists of Bel Canto are so much like the inept, bumbling Nazis of the old tv show Hogan's Heros that I'm expecting a tv serial to be made from this book!The turning point in relations between terrorists and hostages comes when the famous soprano, Roxanne Coss, belts out a famous Puccini aria. How many of you readers are familiar with that beautiful aria, ""O Mio Babbino Caro?"" There are a number of sites on the internet that have the entire aria (don't miss the last two lines that are often omitted). Sarah Brightman's web site has the words in both English and Italian. Listen to it a few times and you will find yourself with tears rolling down your cheeks.The book is a bit slow and not too believable, but enjoyable as a light read (just like Hogan's Heros). The marriage between translator Gen and soprano Coss at the end of the book was incongrous, but there were enough insights into marriage and life to keep my interest to the end."
4,"A beautiful read, a troubling ending","This is a spectacular book that questions how we learn to communicate with one another when the only common language is music. It's extremely well-developed. My only problem with this book was the epilogue. I was so moved by the entire book, but found myself shouting ""WHAT?"" on the very last page. Still, I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of literature or music."
4,"""What is it about music that moves us so deeply""","""What the deuce is there in music, and above all in singing, that moves us so deeply?"" (J Joyce)If you want more information on the specifics about the plot and characters of this book-go read the other very good synposes provided by several readers. I read this book about 3 months ago on a long/quiet trip and it still lingers in the curves of my brain. It was quiet, recumbent , beautiful prose, rich with imagery. I don't ever recall reading about music in the way that Ann Patchett describes it. I remember thinking, I can hear this. It is so real and deep that you are immersed, swimming through the pages. Music, like scent, evokes emotion merged with memories and desire. Yes the ending was abrupt-this is not a fairy tale by any means. I am saving this for another re-read on a still weekend-it is not a book to rush through."
4,"Powerful, moving, well-written, but not without flaws.","This book is a very powerful, moving, mostly well-written book that deserves most of the kudos it has earned. As might be expected given the subject matter, the ending is more than a touch depressing; that, in itself, I could accept given the implausibility of any other outcome. But I felt that the brutality of the ending was not sufficiently explained; without giving away too much, it is hard to describe what I feel was missing, but I do feel that it would have helped if we, unlike the characters, had had some insight into the thought process that led to the result."
3,Moves along,"I found this book engrossing but at the same time not entirely credible. There are a few sections where the writing is just beautiful and I was transported. It did make me wonder how people would respond were they placed in this most unlikely of circumstances. It was interesting how the captives and captors were in suspended animation, as though their current situation would go on forever, but at the same time knowing it would probably end badly. The character development was pretty compelling in some instances. I guess I would rate this book ""good,"" but not highly recommended."
2,Sloppy and Poorly Researched,"I'm still stumped as to how this novel won a Pen/Faulkner award. The plot is completely unbelievable, the writing is overly dramatic, the characters are two dimensional, and it appears that the author completed little or no research on Latin America, international politics, hostage crises, translation/interpretation, opera or any of the the subjects she touches on. Add to this the weak ending, and the book is simply a complete disappointment."
5,Awesome!,"Beautifully written and unique! This book WAS an opera...I could actually HEAR the swelling of the music as the plot quickened...the drums, the woodwinds, the strings.....the sudden climax ...and the denouement. Astounding."
1,Very disappointed,Waiting a whole month after paying for this purchase and finally was informed that they could not honor it. I was refunded but very poor customer service.
2,Held hostage by bad book,"The premise of this book is a good one: a group of strangers taken hostage by terrorists. Unfortunately, reading this book is like biting into a beautifully decorated cake, only to find that it is dry and stale. There is minimum chracter development, and as a result I found myself not caring about any of the chracters. (Everyone in the book seems to be obessed with the opera singer, but it is hard to understand why.) In the beginning of the book there is tension between the hostages and terrorists, but the author lets the flame die out rather quickly, and in the end it seem as though she is writing about people being at ""summer camp"". The book never explores how the situation is affecting the hostages psychologically. The ending of the book is unexpected, and somewhat unbelievable. Very disappointed in this book, a slow read that never lives up to its potential."
1,Boring,"I felt I was being held hostage by this plodding book. Then the ending comes and is over in a flash and the epilogue is just inane. Our book club was about 1/3 like, 1/3 hate and 1/3 couldn't finish it."
4,This book sings!,"I was mesmerized by this novel. I couldn't put it down. I don't know why I'm not giving it 5 stars. The writing reminds me of Joan Didion, for whom I have no higher praise. It is creative, novel, magical. I felt I was in an opera (and I don't usually like opera) but here the words and the characters caught me like opera doesn't. It has stayed with me after reading it; it's different, delightful, and utterly enchanting. The ending was a bit of a letdown but the rest of the book made it all worthwhile. I completely recommend it."
3,The ending kills the story,"I did not expect this book to be completely realistic and I enjoyed the magical realism interpersed in it. However, I feel that underneath the whole kidnapping ordeal was even a deeper story that was going to come out at any moment. What a wasted potential! The book stays pretty much at a superfluous level most of the time. It almost insults an adult's intelligence. It had so much potential but the author never took the time to dig deep and thus delivered a poorly developed story. It was a light, summer read until the end. It was really dissapointing and did not make any sense given the events. This is the major flaw of the book-- the author did not set the stage, even subtlely for the ridiculous ending."
5,Loved it!!,Reading this book reminded me of my experience reading The Fourth Hand by John Irving - it just simply tickled my fancy because it was so unbelievable and quirky yet so darn enjoyable.
4,Great story,"A singer friend suggested the book to me, and I loved it. Excellent character development and the story line, though it sounds bizarre, works quite well. I admit that the ending was a bit contrived, and a let down. However, I recommend Bel Canto, and in fact, plan on reading another Patchett book."
2,overhyped and boring,I can't believe the great hoopla and reviews this book recieved. I was very dissapointed in it and found it rather boring and a ridiculous story with a more ridiculous and unsatisfying ending
2,What a cop out!,I have loved all of Ann Patchett's books so I was ecstatic when I saw this one at the bookstore last year. I settled myself in for a weekend of delicate prose full of bittersweet images and unbreakable characters. And that's exactly what I got until the last ten pages. Then it turned into a manure pit.Do yourself a favor when reading this one...don't read the last scene. It's unnecessary and reads like a completely different author's work. I wasn't expecting a Cinderella style ending but I did expect more somehow.If you want to read a really great book by Ms. Patchett get yourself a copy of Taft. Those characters have stayed with me to this day. It's brilliant.
2,Eh......,"Someone I know raved about this book, so I opened the covers expecting an captivating story, and it was, for maybe the first 10 pages. But the more I read, the less interested I got in finishing the book. Slow pacing, uninteresting characters (for example, there's an opera singer that all the men fall in love with -- why? no clue. Roxanne Coss is a cipher of a character.) So I read about 90 pages, skipped ahead to the epilogue, then went back and read a paragraph or two every 40 pages or so until the end. That told me all I needed to know about the story. As engaging as People magazine and deserving of about as much of my reading time. Just not my cup o' tea."
2,Don't get why this is so highly acclaimed . . .,"I bought this book years ago and attempted to read it several times. I finally forced myself to read it during the holidays. I love opera and I love books, but the words that come to mind regarding Bel Canto are ""tedious"" and ""disappointing"". The Epilogue seems like something that the author threw together to meet a deadline. If I enjoy a book, I'll usually read everything the author has written. This book definitely did NOT make me a big Ann Patchett fan."
1,Bored......,"OK, I heard soo many good things about this book. I thought, I must be missing something!! I got to page 175 and thought I would go read some of the reviews. I found that I agreed with half of the readers. For a while I kept thinking ""what is so great about this book""? I made myself continue to keep picking it back up. It was boring,the plot was very unrealistic and just did not think that the author could possibly keep the average reader interested. I do not like Opera, and I did not ""identify"" with any of the terrorists. It is obvious that a lot of readers loved this book, so maybe, yes, I did miss something, but I can only say that it felt like a text book I was made to read in High School."
4,Bel Canto,This is the first of Ann Patchett's book that I read. All her others have failed to measure up to this one. This one is a delight to read; the others -- mediocre.
4,Really Different,I really enjoyed this book. It was very different and thought provoking. The author has a wonderful view of the human spirit.
5,Bel Canto,Wonderful story! The entire book takes place in one mansion as a dinner party is taken hostage and held for several months. All the intricate relationships that develop over the time spent in a confined place is fascinating.
1,Has to be one of the worst......!!!!,"I started a book club with a group of friends. Bel Canto was recommended. It sounded great... exciting,profound,complex.. nothing could have been further from the dream. The reality found me FORCING myself to pick up the book and get to the end... hoping I could find one thing that would sing its praises at our book club review. It reads worse than a Mills and Boon romance (the mass produced love stories in the UK). I couldn't find a character I was drawn to, a piece of writing that sang to my soul, an event that had me on the edge of my seat... and to top it all off, the plot appeared oh so familiar. The terrorist group Tupac Amaru took a group of hostages in Lima, Peru, back in the the late 90's and all of them blown to bits at the end. Not an original story, needed strong coffee to stop me falling asleep and I would NEVER recommend this book to anyone, least of all a book club!!"
2,A Struggle,"I was expecting more from this book after hearing glowing reviews from trusted sources. It dragged for me. While I loved the language and imagery that Patchett used, I had no emotional attachment to the characters. I found most of them to be quite shallow and unsympathetic. While I believe that the pace was intentionally slow, so as to add the proper setting for the story, it never regained what momentum it had in the beginning. I was lost in the monotony, and it was a struggle for me to get through. Probably closer to 1.5 stars for me, as, like I said, I did enjoy the prose, just not the story or characters."
5,Brilliant and Provocative,"This is a beautifully written, mesmerizing story about people I came to care about (to the point of aching) by the time I reached its emotional, powerful ending. It is riveting. It is not like any book I have read before--and I have read a few! The plot is unique and intriguing. The characters come together in an incredible situation, all at odds, but by the dramatic ending, they are dancing together in a fine and beautiful waltz. But the ball must end, and when it does, I was left stunned. It is not overly graphic in its sexuality or violence, and yet it manages to evoke strong emotions from the reader. It is romantic, riveting, personal, and spellbinding. Something here for everyone."
2,Thin characters,"I have to echo the sentiments of the previous reviewer. I'm an avid reader, but I'm finding this book difficult to finish. The character development is weak in my opinion -- I just don't care about these characters. Also, for the most part I don't find Patchett's language to be interesting, engaging or unique. I'm disappointed..."
1,"Repeat After Me: Repetition, Repetition, Repetition","I thought at first I had a wonderful book, a blend of lyricism, love of music, and romance. Then the absurd happened. The plot plodded along. I felt bludgeoned by the repetition of everything in chapter after chapter. Uggh. Life is too short to read this stuff. If you want something in a whole different class and a hundred times better, read ""An Equal Music,"" by Vikram Seth."
5,Simply Lovely,"There is an absolute beauty in the simplicity of this story and to Ann Patchett's writing in general that I find irresistible. ""Bel Canto"" was the first of her books that I read and it lead me to read every other novel she's written. I'm only sorry I have to wait for something new to be published."
5,Amazing,"This book was so amazing. What started out as a thriller with the terrorists taking people hostage, turned into a love story and a relationship between the terrorists and the hostages that you would never expect. The grim situation turns into a beautiful event, and the ending will have you speechless."
3,Overrated,"Lured into buying this book by all the positive reviews, I was greatly disappointed after reading it. The plot line could have been taken from any cheap thriller, the characters remain strangely flat and underdeveloped, and the references to opera music could only be classified as pretentious and superficial. If you are looking for good writing rather than plot driven melodrama you are better off reading Jonathan Franzen, Jeffrey Eugenides or Michael Chabon."
2,Fluff,"Ms. Patchett's book is an easy read. Her writing style is at times beautiful. Therefore, if you are looking for a bit of fluff reading, complete with action and romance, you are unlikely to be disappointed. However, if you want characters to be well-developed and to behave believably or if you want to be intellectually challenged, you should probably look elsewhere. This is not a terrible book, but, because I, based on the high praise, was looking for the latter above, I fount it to be terribly disappointing."
2,Not worth the time,I caught myself dozing off several times while reading this book. It just really didn't hold my interest.
2,"Disappointing ""award"" winner","The BEL CANTO story line is very contrived and contains far too much foreshadowing of future events. How fortunate to have so many talented individuals available to manage any situation. I prefer a story line that draws the reader in, allowing them to make their own conclusions about the events as they unfold. This story is utterly unrealistic and leaves very little to the reader's imagination. I wish I would have realized it was just another sappy romance novel."
2,Are you all in another dimension? This book was terrible!,"I was completely disappointed. The unlikeliness of the hostage situation, the sheer boredom of the novel until at least page 200 and then the hideous ending...Truly not worth the read."
3,Hit Over the Head,"I was relieved to find out that other readers had similar reactions to this silly book since it got such positive play in the press. Patchett does have a gentle and readable narrative style, but I became bored with repetitious descriptions of Roxane's towering talent and Mr. Hosokawa's self-deprecation.(A side note: Someone should inform the publisher's back cover copywriter that ""Roxane"" is spelled with one, not two n's.)"
3,Bel Canto,"The delivery, of course, was immediate as I ordered it on my Kindle. I find the book difficult to get into but will try again."
3,Bel Canto,I was not at all crazy about this book. We have just recently started a book club and this was the second book to read for it. I just couldn't get into it. We did have a rather intense discussion about it.
4,Wow!,"This was a wonderful beautifully written book. Perhaps it was a little slow to start, but the book reminds you of the beauty of people that lies below the surfaces, people that we frequently rush past or discount."
4,Bel Canto - lyrical and lovely,"In the jungles of South America, terrorists disrupt an international gathering of wealthy diplomats and powerful businessmen. The rebels hope to capture their country's president, but unexpected events transform their perfect plan into a hostage crisis. Although few speak the same language, captors and captives alike reach an understanding through music, forming unexpected bonds, discovering hidden potential, and learning the meaning of happiness under the most unusual circumstances.There's a reason Bel Canto is an award-winning bestseller. Patchett has a gift for language, crafting a tale of beauty and violence, of love and tragedy. Her vivid descriptions, humorous yet believable characters and all-too-familiar depictions of relationships combine to create a novel that sings."
3,Music¬øan International Language,"You don&#65533;t have to like opera to like this book&#65533;just like the characters who people the book didn&#65533;t have to like opera to love Roxane Coss. The story takes you into a frightening situation&#65533;being a hostage&#65533;and begins to uncover the beauty found when tragedy or fear renders us all equals. Music, like love, is something that transcends cultures and borders and is a fit metaphor to build this story around. A Japanese gentleman finds himself soulmate to an American, more so than to his own Japanese people. A young terrorist begins to find she belongs in the land of the educated and cultured. This book shakes up the assumption that you are what you are born to and explores the process of change, growth and adaptation. Fairly good read, though a little slow at times."
4,Beautiful Experience (4.5 points),The reading of this book is an experience. I almost always choose books that are plot-driven. This is not one of those. This little book is about people in an unusual (and unpleasant) situation. It's how they adapt and survive. It's not for everyone -- but maybe for you.
5,A Beautiful Book!,"I just happened to pick this book up about a year ago and absolutely loved it. I read it slowly so I could linger over the characters. No one I knew had heard of it, but I kept seeing it on the best seller list...for months and months and months. I knew I had discovered a gem. I often daydream of a movie being made from the novel...who would play the different parts? What an international cast! What could it teach us about the futility of terrorism, but might it give us insight into why these things happen? This books shows that deep down we ARE all the same. Who among us remembers this happening in real life? I do, but vaguely.The very end was a little strange, but then stranger things have happened!This lovely, small book is a must to read."
2,Bel Canto..............very slow!,It became very boring after maybe the first chapter....................the book never moved! stuck in the same descriptions of their movements. I understood the concept. Ms. Patchett explained in her interview that she based it on the Lima hostage of the Peruvian President in 1996 ? but it seems she did not research in what happened in the 4 1/2 months they were detained. Someone would have lived to tell about their ordeal. Disappointing.
2,Rewrite the opening and closing,"About 40 pages into the book I was worried that the author was going to give me the same scene from every character's perspective. And with more than 100 characters in the room, it would get quite tedious. Patchett settles on about a dozen characters to develop and follow through the story. The main section of the book flowed well, but I did get to a point when I wanted it to end. The last section of the book was disappointing. While you expected the terrorists to be killed, the final marriage was unexpected and unbelievable."
4,Microcosm of Terrorism,"This is an extraordinary novel -- well written, suspenseful, knowledgeable about opera, but most of all, it creates a microcosm of an ideal world -- if but for a short time - which ends disastrously. Its inevitable ending, foreshadowed from almost the first pages, intensifies its relationships and subplots, because the reader recognizes how tenuous they are. There is no Stockholm syndrome here. Rather the slowly evolving relationships among and between some of the hostages and terrorists seem as natural as breathing. One quibble: In describing one chess game, the author mistakes a rook for a knight - a jarring error in an otherwise well-researched novel. The last few pages of the book, while still holding the reader, were unnecessary. The shock of the book would be even greater were we not to get the sort of post-script."
2,Bel Canto,"This was my first Ann Patchett book. Her style simply is not for me and I am not induced to read any of her others. If you like her style, you will most likely enjoy this book but, I found it tedious. When I got close to the end, I was only reading a few sentences per page just to get through it. The story itself is a great idea, but the book failed on holding my interest."
1,Bel Canto,"Hated it. This book came highly recommended from a few people, which is the reason I actually finished it. A very slow read, and I didn't connect with the characters at all. The story, which takes place in current day, seemed so unrealistic to me, in that the unlikely affairs in an unlikely time frame were such a stretch for my imagination. I plugged along because I just had to see how the writer wrapped it up, and was disappointed again. I only suggest this book if you are having trouble sleeping."
5,Lyrical,"Patchett's book is about a group of people taken hostage in a South American country. It's about the relationships that develop between the hostages and their captors, and it's a wonderful study of the importance of music and art in life."
2,"Two out of three ain't bad,","This holdiay season I wanted to go with erotic reading, so I got TOO MUCH TEMPTATION, OLDE HOLLYWOOD and this book. I was disappointed with the character choices throughout this book. I was expecting great tensions and twists and got none. It was natural, terrorists hostages angry men, frightened women threats of death for non compliance.... The acquiesence was too easy and the ending will leave you shaking your head wondering why the author ever came up with that. I'm going to watch the news tonight and see if I can find a story to turn into a novel like this author did. So much for originality..... But the other two books were great so I'm way ahead of the game."
1,It doesn't work. It's terribly overrated.,"Yes, people are raving, and I began to read with greatanticipation, but the book doesn't work. The charactersare not at all deeply imagined, and I never felt close toany of them. Maybe this is what happens when you base a bookon an idea (and one lifted from the news) rather thancharacters.And her prose is fine but nothing great, no sentences you'llbe jotting down and quoting to others.A great novel really brings you deep within the people ofthe story and shows you something new. This doesn't do itat all.Read Russell Banks or Joyce Carol Oates or John Edgar Wideman.They write great novels."
4,BEAUTIFUL SONG,THE CASSETTE TAPES OF BEL CANTO WERE IN VERY GOOD CONDITION. I LIKED THE NARRATOR AND WAS OVER-ALLVERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE.ALSO THE TAPES ARRIVED IN THE MAIL WELL PACKAGED AND IN GOOD TIME.
1,not worth the time,"i failed to do the research, not something that i would usually like, additionally, not well written, boring and very flat"
2,Who thought this was award-worthy?,"I had high hopes for this book based on the plethora of positive reviews and the fact that it had won several awards. Well, whoever decided that Bel Canto deserved an award or thought that it merited a rave review needs to be fired.The idea for the story was unique and HAD potential. However, as executed by Patchett, all potential is lost.The plot is boring, the main characters do not inspire passion or thought, and the epilogue makes no sense. In fact, the epilogue is the worst part of the book. The main character Gen does something that so out of character that it is unbelievable and none of the other characters seems to think his behavior is out of character!Attention critics...You shouldn't give a book an award just because the IDEA behind it is good, the author needs to follow through and deliver a good book.What a disappointment. Skip this book and read something else, anything else. Ugh."
5,Bel Canto,"Captivating, made me want to see an opera, ballet, listen to music, make love to my husband,incourage my children on the gift of languages. Only I did not like the very endding, but hey great reading till then."
2,Starts out well...,"Although it was enjoyable overall, it was not that great. (I preferred the Magicians Assistant.) In Bel Canto especially the story drags on too long, the middle has too much ""filler""."
3,ROMANCE/THRILLER--not . . .,"Typical romance novel fare--- although there's nothing wrong with that if it's done correctly. The author seems to have lifted the scope of this novel right from the evening news, mrely changing the location from Peru to an ""Undisclosed South American Country."" The book is plagued by predictable plot points and there are no delectable plot twists, or sensational character development. This was my first Ann Patchett novel, and she is ceratainly a good writer, but I would be skeptical of reading another of her books unless I saw a spark of originality."
1,Lost my interest,"I am a professional classical musician, and was looking forward to reading this beautiful book about the power of music. To my disappointment, this book turned out to be a total bore, with a stagnant plot and dimensionless characters. The ""psychological"" babble only skims the surface of human experience. I'm already three-quarters into the book, and still can't find anything worth turning of the next page. I'm only still reading it because I hate to quit a book I've started. The only redeeming feature of this book is its simple prose, which makes it a quick read."
5,Poetic and engaging,"This is an excellent novel that is written with a great deal of flair and originality. The plot is intricate and imaginative, with a lot subtleties and nuances. It's downright suspenseful and exciting too. A terrorist abduction may not sound like too unusual of a plot, but there is more than meets the eye here. Plus the characters are very interesting and well developed. The quality of writing is also extremely high, as well as somewhat eccentric in a pleasing, poetic kind of way. Overall, the novel is excellent on a number of levels that I've mentioned, and I recommend it highly. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
2,Bel Canto - For Whom the Bell Toils,"I fail to see why this book is acclaimed. While the subject is timely ""terrorism and kidnapping in an unnamed 3rd world Latin American venue"", the plot is tedious, and implausible. Worse, the author spends 50% of the novel telling the reader about the voice of a primadonna...yes...a selfish primadonna and by the end of the book we are supposed to like her??? Only a quarter of the way into the book I had tinninitis because I was so sick of listening/reading about The Voice. Other characters are woven in but are very stereotypical. The ending is so improbable...it seems the author ran out of time or ink and certainly creativity. Maybe not, since there is only the slightest plot and a boring preponderance of adjectival description of operatic voice. This book could have been saved if there had been some real history woven in or even some real geography a la James Michener...some redeeming value."
4,What a read!,"Bel Canto was a selection by my book club in which I read many months ago. The author, Ann Patchett makes you love and hate the characters for their human behaviors. It is not a simple story of being held captive, but where due to the circumstances they are made to self reflect, learn love and hopefully to grow. This is one of those books that tears at your heart strings and makes your brain go into high gear. Enjoy!"
1,Surprisingly average,"I bought this book really wanting and expecting to like it. I read that it was on several people's top ten book list. The premise sounded interesting. After the first chapter the story stalls, very little happens until the next to last chapter, and the last chapter makes no sense at all. I diddn't care for any of the characters so I gotta ask; what the ...??? How did this book manage to win a prize? At one point the author actually writes something like... ""then one week later"". It's a bad sign when an author has to skip over one week's worth of her own fiction to move the story along. Sorry but I can't recommend it. Life is too short to waste time reading so-so writing."
3,The reader of this audio book detracts,"I heard great things about this book from friends, but the reader, Anna Fields, detracts from the story. Her voice is too strident, making it difficult to enjoy (or judge) the writing."
1,Not worth it,"I read this book since I had seen the reviews and the premise sounded intriguing. I was not impressed. I thought the setup would allow for some great political, or class, or international relations issues to be dealt with; perhaps this bias wasn't fair to the author. This is possible. I also may enjoy opera, but have nowhere near the love for it as a single one of these characters did. That ended up being a major gripe; I could not believe that everyone loved opera and opera singers that much (oh, and the incorrect naming of a chess piece was also grating). Simply not possible. Finally none of the characters pulled me in. In fact, I disliked almost all of them. The ending was one realistic and revealing part of the book. It was not enough. Reading this ended up being painful; although I am fully aware that it could be because of my personal tastes."
2,This book is very boring,"This book was selected as a book club read, but I am really struggling with this. The premise of a group of people being kipnapped for months on end is just ridiculous. Although the characters themselves are interesting, in general, this one is a slow, tedious read."
3,Not as good as I expected,"The first half was captivating, and the second half annoying and felt like a fancy romance novel. After the first 100 pages or so, it would be hard for anyone to suspend disbelief. In that regard, the epilogue was the worst. Also, I feel that the author should have been more critical of the military tactics used to resolve the hostage standoff.However, I will still check out the author's book Truth & Beauty when I get around to it."
2,"Boring, Boring, Boring","If you have a ""Y"" chromosome this book is not for you. My wife liked it (she IS a soprano); however, couldn't relate at all to the characters and thought the ending was completely contrived and illogical. Very much in the vein of ""what are your really thinking"" and ""share your feelings with me."" Budding juvenile chess masters and choir boy opera singers and the translator that just happens to speak every language known to man (with the possible exception of aramaic) strain credulity."
2,Didn't meet expectations,"I had heard great things about this book, how thought-provoking it is, etc. Most unimpressed. The characters are not very intriguing. The ending is totally unsatisfying."
2,Certainly not what I expected.,"This was my bookclub's choice that I didn't get to read until a month later. Too bad!! I wish I had skipped it. Reading 2-3 pages at night it took FOREVER! And, I have to ask myself, why did I only read a few pages? Ans: nothing was happening. This book is truly unbelievable in every way....and SLOW. My impression is that the author has other good books, so I will give her another chance. Can't recommed this one, though."
3,Not that great.,"After hearing my sister and a close friend rave about this book I bought a copy while I was at the beach. It's an easily readable book but the story didn't grip me. I did, however, like the author's interesting use of names - some (particularly the opera singer) were called by their first AND last names 99% of the times they were mentioned while others were referred to by their titles (Mr. or General) or first names throughout. The book has a surprise ending but I found it very implausable."
5,Absolutely Beautiful Novel,"Wonderful book, very well written with wonderful nuances throughout. An absolute joy to read."
2,Bel Canto Finisho,"I bought this book because of the rave reviews from friends and other sources. I am approximately 3/4 of the way through and have no desire to finish. I feel that the book has been such a bore and letdown that I simply don't care what happens at the end.The story is extremely slow-moving. Quite simply, it is a story of a bunch of rich people at a birthday party who are taken hostage. Sounds like an interesting plot but Ms. Platchet has managed to turn it into a very mundane matter.I did not find myself connecting with any characters and I will say no more. If you want to read the book, borrow it from the library - it's not worth buying."
2,Too much hype,"Sorry, I didn't see what was so special about this story -- couldn't suspend disbelief and didn't care for any of the characters. Ending was very disappointing."
2,bland and lacking metaphor,"i read this book for a bookclub. we split on how we liked it - as is normally the case. i dislike it. i think it is bland and lacks an external link that would have made the book so much more worthy to recommend. i appreciate the love stories, opera references and the author's deliberate rebuking of stereotypes relating to nationality and gender. there is a factual basis to this book and a little more political or socio-economic commentary however subtle would have been appreciated. There are reasons to like this book but there are so many better books than this to read. quite honestly i'm surprised this book has received as much fanfare as it has."
2,Nothing like I expected,"With all the hype surrounding this book, and all the awards, I thought I couldn't miss by reading it. This book frustrated me the way it droned on without much of anything happening. Unless of course you count hostages falling in love with fellow hostages unpredictable and interesting. The ending was terrible. It was as though Patchett decided she needed to finish the book on the double, so in the span of a few pages all the bad guys get killed, the adulterer gets killed (how convenient that now he doesn't have to face his wife), and the only ones left are the singer and the translator. I found that particular aspect of the story nauseating. I have read other books by Patchett, so I know she's not a bad writer; she just didn't realize her potential in this novel."
2,Bel Canto,"Tedious and plodding to read at first. Some of the prose is lovely, but if the reader is not a sophisticated music lover it is hard to identify with the characters' passion for it. Got better toward the end, but not enough to recommend book to others unless you are an opera lover."
2,Not What I Expected,"After seeing Bel Canto on many lists, I thought I would check it out. The premise of the book sounded interesting and I thought it would be suspenseful. Instead it turned out to be a lame romance novel with a disappointing ending. I appreciate the moral of the story about slowing down and really learing what makes you happy but most of the plot seemed implausable. You know that there can't be a happy ending, but how about more than one only 3 paragraphs long! That was the biggest disappointment of the book. You finally start to feel for the characters and then you're dropped without any closure. And don't even get me started on the ridiculous ""plot twist"" epilogue.I would not reccommend this book to anyone who likes a complete story. While the writing is good, the story left me hanging."
2,What was the point?,"A four and a half month hostage crisis. Hostages sneaking around at night to make love. And a Japanese translator that speaks any language the author can think of all tied together by an ending that will leave you confused and disappointed What kind of story is this? I will admit, however, that Patchett writes well, but I do not think that the story itself is worthy of the awards it has received."
2,"Decent writing, mostly boring, totally unbelievable...","Basically a Harlequin romance but better written. There were a few stiff lines, yes, like ""...the silk folds of her brain"" but for the most part, 'tis better fare than the pure, adulterated romance stuff. Unfortunately, though, this may be even more farcical than your average Harlequin affair: The plot is wholly implausible.A lot of women will like this, I suppose; a lot of men will be bored to tears, like I was.Not a lot of grit, the stuff of life--mostly a lot of fluff."
1,Bel can't oh,Sorry. My 2nd PATCHETT book. I guess we don't speak the same language! Fiction should at least be entertaining as a payoff for the investment of time.
2,"condescending, patronizing and empty of wit","Patchett 's characters feel like miniature toy humans--- cute, but incapable of stepping outside the caricature that Patchett so repetitively describes. The essential premise is promising, but Patchett fails to take advantage of it and instead relies on the kind of silly melodrama that El Presidente Masuda stayed home to watch. The result is tedious in the extreme. I felt as if I had been taken hostage.Patchett does know how to write. If only her characters were genuinely interesting, instead of stereotypes."
3,Read it once,"I had to read this for high school. It was a summer reading book, and I was dreading it. I waited until the end of summer to read it. It started off slow, then it picked up. Soon i found myself excited to get to the next page. This book really made me think about things from different perspectives. I enjoyed it and ended up really liking the characters. So if you had to read this book for school, cheer up...Def don't judge this book by it's cover. It's a really good book."
2,Huge disappointment,"What a letdown! Having heard great things about this book I was set for a fine read. Reading a few of the reviews here I just have to understand that one person's treasure is...well you, know. And this book is as cliched as that old expression. Character development? Amateurish and simplistic. Thin Plot? Absolutely! Fascinating evolution of the characters? Huh? Improbable and arbitrary is more like it. Plot resolution? Foreshadowed is too kind...telegraphed is more like it. An exception is the unlikely pairing of two characters after the resolution and that is simply another two-dimensional element of a two-dimensional novel. Perhaps it is an attempt at trying to make the book more intriguing with an ""unhappy"" ending...one would have to care about the characters for that to work. I was only happy that this tired tome HAD finally ended. Sorry...thanks for playing! There are many fine novels out there...please try again!"
1,A poor excuse for a book,"If I could, I would give it a minus 5.How can such inacurate drivel receive the reviews that it did.I want my money back !!!!"
2,A study in minutiae,"I bought this book because I am a singer. I heard on NPR that it is being made into an opera. That sounded intriguing. I must preface my remarks by saying that the book I read before this was the autobiography of Maria von Trapp. Obviously, I had just come from a book that was full of twists and turns, close calls, movement from country to country, etc. What was SO FRUSTRATING about this book is its over-reliance on minutiae. The majority of the book takes place in one room. Toward the end, the characters start to travel to other rooms in the house. I became mildly interested when the plot began to turn on the eventual interaction between the characters. Perhaps I am just not a fan of this genre. Perhaps ""magical realism"", as this book has been labeled, is not for me. I have no problem with Patchett's writing ability. The writing is poetic and informed. I just feel that the plot was very flat until a spike at the end followed by an unusual epilogue."
1,Bad spelling,"I haven't finished the second chapter yet, and all the spelling mistakes in Spanish are getting on my nerves (not to mention the use of some words). Is that difficult to hire someone to correct those mistakes?"
5,I adored this book,"This is escapist reading of a most unusual sort. It's not about someone escaping to a remote island -- it's an ""accidental"" escape that none of the parties have planned, and the results are fascinating and exhilarating. I didn't want this book to end -- but the situation in the book is one that obviously couldn't be sustained indefinitely. The author's insights into how a hostage situation might effect those involved, and how the relationships between captors and captives might evolve are really impressive."
3,"Polished prose, soul-less story","The author clearly knows how to put words together. My main quibble with this book is that the characters and their actions are just too polished, too neat. The singer is oh-so-marvelous, the interpreter is oh-so-capable, some of the guerrillas are oh-so-talented - if only their talents were allowed to flourish!Etc., etc.Also, the way in which the hostage drama proceeds (over an extended time) seems wholly unrealistic.This book reads like an exercise in style rather than a story of real, live, flesh-and-blood people with their strengths and weaknesses, their inspirations and mistakes, their emotions and actions and choices. It's not bad, but it's far less than it might have been."
1,thought it would never end,"I was really looking forward to reading this novel because of the excellent reviews and from a recommendation, but I have to admit I was very disappointed. It was boring, very slow and I couldn't get into it. I didn't care much for the characters and their love of opera. It would not end!"
2,Implausible and drawn out with a rushed and horrible ending,"Grueling needless descriptions, but I thought that it might get better so I kept reading it. It took me a very long time to really start getting into it. I did start liking some of the characters. At least I was able to finish it. I got so SICK of everyone worshiping the opera singer in such an unrealistic fashion, and I like opera. And they were in that house for how long?? Ridiculous. And the ending made it feel like the author simply got sick of writing the book and had to bring it to a swift end. I could think of so many better endings. What is the point of developing the characters so well just so they can be swiftly eliminated at the end. Stupid. It could have had a fabulous ending, which is where I thought the author was taking us."
5,"Bravo, Ann Patchett","The most touching, moving book I've read in years. Explores the human condition from many angles, profiling a wide array of international characters and the unwitting, often surprising connections they make with one another. Filled with pathos, romance, as well as the heartbreak of humans not fulfilling all their full potential. Written in beautiful prose, not one wasted word.I give a lot of books away after I read them. This one I must keep.C Weingartliterary fiction, contemporary fiction, opera, book club book, hostages, fiction, amazing read, 20th century american fiction, novel"
1,Not a pleasant read,"For me, Bel Canto was extremely overwritten, had stereotypical foreign characters, and an inane story line. I struggled to read it as my mind kept wandering and I kept wanting it to end. The main character was completely unappealing. The hostage situation, ridiculous. Overall, I found this book extremely disappointing and shallow."
1,PLOT MOVES LIKE A GLACIER...ZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"you'd think with a premise like this book has,it would be a page turner. oh my. couldn't be farther from the case. i started this book at thanksgiving, shelved it and returned to it only after my book club insisted on reading it for march. i'm STILL slogging through it. while there is technically nothing wrong with patchett's writing, it is just tedious, dull and uninteresting. the plot moves along at the speed of a glacier. save yourself a few bucks and take a pass on this novel."
2,Not for people who know Latin america,"While one can't expect an author to only write about places she knows, readers who know about Latin American politics may find it hard to stay engrossed in this book. There are too many times I found myself distracted by the hodge podge of generic Latin American qualities lumped together into one fictional country and I was reminded of an 1980s old plot on All My Children that took place among the banditos and federales ""in South America"". But then, Bel Canto is meant to be operatic. We don't listen to Aida to learn about Egypt. So, if you are a reader who doesn't care about stuff like that, you will probably really enjoy this book. If you do, reading this will probably annoy you and make you feel like a curmudgeon ""malgre lui""."
1,What a disappointing waste of time,"This is one of the those books that makes you mad you wasted your time on it. I can't imagine why anyone thinks this is good literature? It could have been a very interesting story, but you come out knowing little more about the characters than their ""base"" descriptions which you painfully hear over and over and over again.My book was actually missing 16 pages (not sure why) but I read on expecting that not much would change. And it didn't. I just had the advantage of missing another 16 pages of fluff.How could this book win awards?"
2,Put this book down & stop reading it if you find yourself rolling your eyes over the excessive flowery sentiments in this book,"I completely agree with the reviewer below who gave the advice for us to put the book if you find yourself 'dragging"" through the book for the 1st 20 pages or so...It really does get worse. Ann Patchett describes her main characters with too much sacharrine, I felt I was getting cavities while reading it. She describes them like a mother who brags excessively about her only child. It just got extremely boring, agitating and too predictable. The way the opera singer was presented was so unrealistic. It gets to be overkill at a certain point I think. I got through 5 chapters and had made a wise decision that I'm not going to finish this book. Ughh..I was so disappointed. Had high hopes for Bel Canto though and her writing style and seriously think that this book was over rated."
1,What a Waste,"Ms. Patchett has an obvious gift for writing. What a shame to waste her talent on such a preposterous premise as put forth in Bel Canto. This plot might fly on the big screen with the help of technicolor and surroundsound to overwhelm our sense with our senses. My willing suspension of disbelief, however, took a nose dive in chapter six and was not able to recover from the tailspin. Out of respect for the author I finished reading her novel, but it was a struggle, indeed."
1,bored to tears,I'm just amazed so many people gave it a good review. I had to force myself to finish it.
2,Tepid storytelling,"Moronic, simplistic plot. Little character development. This ""award winning"" book did little to pique my interest or make me care if anyone made it through the contrived hostage-taking. And the epilogue...give me a break!Don't waste your time on this one."
3,Bel Canto falls flat,"The novel is hailed as being a superb study of character development and an exploration of how terrorists think, how people fall in love, etc., etc. It does none of those things. The charcters are really nothing more than two-dimensional figures who happen to spend 4.5 months locked in a house together. I had no emotional attachment to any of the characters and I found their actions improbable and plastic. This plot idea is interesting, but it falls flat. The depth and heart of the story is superficial at best. I was dissappointed."
2,"novel trivializes terrorism, political unrest, and art","Even before September 11, I would have found this novel--with its stock characters (South American terrorists, Japanese businessman, banana republic politicians) somehwere between offensive and dull. Though the author is a wonderful writer, her use of stereotypes and central casting characters and settings ultimately trivializes what could have been an interesting fictional meditation on the power of art. The smugness, insularity, and the connotative shortcuts could only have been written by an American for whom issues such as beauty, justice, and culture are not life-and-death (literally or figuratively) issues."
3,I've heard this somewhere before,"Oh yeah the evening news. I like erotica and all, but this was just a mindless attempt to titilate and I thought that it was just so poorly done. Everyone acted like caricatures. It seems that everyone is knocking off everyone else or themselves in the literary world these days and this is just more of the same. Read my reviews of other books, because I have found some originality off the beaten path."
2,windshear,"What starts out as promising in the very beginning, attempts to take off and then crashes to the ground. Poorly written and poorly researched. Ann Patchett tris to illustrate how unpredictable love is, yanking on heartstrings trying to make us believe, but ends up with disjointed drivvle.318 pages worth of wasted time."
1,Waste of Eyesight,"The book has an unbelievable story line, no action, wooden characters and an ending out of left field."
2,Boring and Overly written,I didn't like this book at all. I couldn't even finish it. It was too complicated and too many underlying characters.
1,Plodding...,"Well, I simply can't finish is, and I'm 3/4 of the way through. I bought it because of the good reviews on Amazon (Patchett's relatives?) and I have yet to care about any of the characters or the thin plot. Feels like walking on a sticky floor. Yuck."
2,Poor,"This book was a disappointment. While the plot was initially intriguing, I lost interest quickly. The characters were unrealistic and the writing style was excruciatingly bad."
2,Great Start that gradually grows tedious and boring,"I read some great reviews about this, and was anxious to read it. I read a lot, and love great writing. However, after 200 pages of this thing, I just couldn't take it anymore. What started off as intriguing and suspenseful gradually turned tedious and implausible. Ms. Patchett's characters seemed to lose more of their charm each day the hostage situation dragged.........on.Eventually, I didn't care about any of them. I just don't see how all those men could suddenly fall in love with Opera and the diva. I have a hard time believing that the people ""outside"" would do nothing for four months - c'mon! Mr. Hosokawa...who could like him? Roxane Coss...diva is right - totally unlikable. Gen...great potential for development until his juvenile infatuation with the little terrorist. I don't care what happened. I had to quit."
3,Not her best effort,"Was excited to read Bel Canto, since Magician's Assistant was flawless. This one is all in the language: Patchett writes like her character Roxanne Cross supposedly sings, but the story was weaker than usual. Didn't care enough about any of the hostages or terrorists til too many months into the saga."
3,Elements of humanity,"This book was a gift from a friend because of my love of opera. Though the book contained the character of an opera singer, the elements of humanity in this day of terrorism and its influence in our world were brought into focus through the characters of those who sought to bring about a difference to the world in which we live. Opportunities to bond with people in desperate circumstances, to understand the talent and ability of people who have never had opportunity; this is the fiber that brings meaning to this story, even when you understand that there can be no alternative end. The writing style is uncomplicated, allowing your imagination to paint the images suggested within the pages. A good read with some thought provoking ideas. Not too complex."
2,Under developed and disappointing.,"I was really excited to get this book after reading the great reviews. However...it just dragged on and on. I simply could not connect with the characters. I just didn't care about them. The author has a beautiful style of writing, but lacks the ability to fully develop the characters in this book.The plot was thin and could have been written by anyone. Perhaps if I was an avid fan of opera I might have enjoyed it more. Many parts were just a bit over the top of reality. I could believe a translator who fluently spoke five languages, but when Gen speaks in eight or more, that strikes me as a bit far-fetched.I finally made it to the end, only to be disappointed again. That type of ending would have happened realistically within the first week or two. But 4 1/2 months later??It was a very disappointing book from a very talented author."
3,An uneven read,"There were great portions in this book, but it wobbles to the finish line and collapses short of the tape. There are portions that are unreadable and the sentences are poorly designed with dangling participles strewn about. I was surprised at how poorly edited the book was. It read like a rush job that was patched together piecemeal so it could get out on time. Perhaps there will ultimately be a better edition edited. The storyline is an unoriginal newscast, but that could've been interesting as well if it took us inside this dramatic event from an interesting viewpoint--it didn't."
5,Mesmerizing read!,"Like good music, this story flows over the mind and heart, pulling the reader in. Bel Canto, by Ann Patchett, is a fascinating study of human character in unusual circumstances. Even though I knew the eventual end of the story, I, like the characters, kept hoping for the best outcome. I couldn't help myself! I was drawn in--as they were! The story was riveting, but the characters were even more so. I loved them all."
3,A whimsical tragedy with a diverse cast,"This book's mix of a very romantic tone, preposterous alliances, cutesy sense of humor, and underlying impetus towards the tragic worked in waves for me. At times I found it annoying. Other times, it was all as beautiful/funny/poignant as it was intended. By the end I felt genuinely sad. I liked Patchett's way of describing some things. Her most brilliant creation was certainly Gen the translator. The way he blossoms while under hostage in the Vice President's home is believable and interesting."
3,Ahh...The Power of Music,"there are moments while one is in the midst of reading this wonders to themselves how it is that these very different chararacters come together & fall in love. The author has taken the most unlikely women & men and had them fall deeply for each other against the background of unspeakable depravitiy. As one reads the story & continues to wonder why, the author does reveal to the reader not with words but with her thoughts that what she describes as love goes above & beyond what we everyday humans can ever imagine. In Bel Canto love is the ability to feel safe with another person (even if the thoughts of safty are an illusion) & for two people to be together (even if they don't speak the same language); to know that they can feel each other through music. This is a novel of how music touches our souls; & therefore our hearts as well. A worthy read for those who can only imagine the unimaginable...."
2,What was she thinking?,"Imagine eating a bucket of popcorn, and then discovering a dead cockroach on the bottom. That's how the ""epilogue"" to Bel Canto works. Patchett has spun us along, whispering ""Imagine THIS happens,"" and because her language is vivid and the fantasies appealing, we agree over and over, knowing full well that ""THIS"" only happens in the imagination. Then reality dumps a hailstorm on the sandbox. Fair enough.If she had stopped there, she would have had a lyrical tale, not so much cautionary (Pretty maids all come to dust) as whimsical (Isn't it nice to think so?). If she had, as one reviewer suggested, gone with the humor that the story inevitably creates, since it runs contrary to our and the characters' expectations, she would have had a book not so different from Bel Canto. Instead she gives us an epilogue centered on event that is neither a satisfying fantasy nor likely in the real world.Give it a read, if you don't mind cockroaches."
2,Some rich descriptive passges but poor structure,"I found this book very disappointing in the end. Some of the writing was very evocative and quite beautiful, but just when you were feeling like you were enjoying being immersed in the words, something jarred you out of this feeling. As a novel I felt it was quite unbalanced and ran out of steam. One desperate fan in my book group defended it by saying this was deliberately done to evoke the hostage drama running out of steam. Please! And the ending was appallingly crass and tacked on. Utter tripe was my overall feeling!"
1,Ugh. Wait for the inevitable movie,"I think Ann Patchett had a love affair with someone closely resembling Roxanne Coss and wanted to send her a valentine...this book must be it. This character does not merit the fawning every other character performs on her behalf, and the whole concept of these ""Stockholm syndrome"" characters acting the way they do is way beyond concocted. Save yourself the burden of reading the story, as this is the precise type of drivel Hollywood loves to produce into an overblown movie (Think of ""The Horse Whisperer"" and you'll know what I mean)."
