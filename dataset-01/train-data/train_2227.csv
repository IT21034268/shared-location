1,Caveat Emptor,"Remember the scene in the Nicholas Cage movie ""Bringing Out the Dead"" where the old man is dying and they play him his favorite Sinatra to soothe him during his last moments? Diana Krall's past few CDs are like that to me.... So, fool me, I bought it without listening to it first. It is bad. Very bad. It's not romantic at all; it doesn't flow from one song to the next; and the singing and lyrics are awful. There is one nice ballad, ""Narrow Daylight,"" but I'm way past buying a CD for just one song. A past reviewer who praised it, nonetheless called it a ""hard listen."" In these times, we could all use the gentle, soothing, and romantic listen that was Diana Krall."
2,I Hope She Stays in The Other Room,"I admire all artists of the caliber of Krall and I respect them taking a new adventurous side road. However, this album is not for me. Krall has had me spending money for years but if this keeps up I'll have to find another performer to perform the music I prefer."
1,Diana should stick with the old standards,"I have enjoyed all of Diana Krall's albums ... before ""The Girl in the Other Room"". It was a struggle to hear this new one all the way through and once was enough. It sounds as though she's making up the lyrics as she goes along. Diana, please don't go in this direction. Stick with the old standards which you do so well."
2,an unpleasant surprise,"I should preface my review by saying that I'm a huge fan of Diana Krall. I appreciate her musicanship and the brilliance of her previous albums.That being said, *The Girl in the Other Room* just doesn't stack up to her other work. The musicans on the album are still great (as before), but so much is missing from this album. Diana Krall is just confusing her *brand* with this one. It sounds more like Costello, and less like Krall. Not to say that Costello is bad, but I purposely bought a Diana Krall CD, and I don't feel that I got what I paid for. Besides a couple nice tracks (like *Temptation* & *Love Me Like A Man*), it's really not jazz at all, and the lyrics are abstract not thought-provoking.It only gets two stars because for the first time ever, I have to skip tracks on a Diana Krall CD."
1,Too much Elvis in this CD,"I've been a Diana Krall fan for some time. I love ""Temptation,"" but the rest of the CD is just flat. Not an Elvis fan at all, I could hear his influence way too much. Go back to your own style Diana."
2,Just not very interesting.,"Regardless of genre, the music and lyrics of this album just aren't as interesting, fun, touching... as other songs she's performed in the past. She also tries some different vocal stylings, and I think they tend to sound forced -- and they clash with her otherwise smooth style. It's not that she shouldn't do originals at all, she just needs better originals to do."
2,ATYPICAL KRALL,"THIS IS CLEARLY NOT THE KRALL I AM USED TO OR EXPECTED ON THIS CD.ON MOST TRACKS IT SEEMS AS IF SHE TOOK A PARAGRAPH FROM A MICKEY SPILANE NOVEL AND TRIED TO ADD MUSIC TO IT. IT DOESNT WORK. MELODIES ARE HARD TO FOLLOW, LYRICS (BY THE WAY, ARE WRITTEN BY HER NEW SPOUSE, ELVIS COSTELLO???)MAKE LITTLE SENSE.KRALL, LET'S GET BACK TO COVERING THE STANDARDS LIKE YOU DO SO WELL WITH YOUR BAND. UNTIL THEN, YOU ARE OFF OF MY BUY LIST.GORDON"
3,Disappointed Fan from NorthShore Mass.,"We have all of Diana's CD's and love all of them...until we purchased ""The Girl In The Other Room"". I had read the reviews and took a chance that it wasn't as bad as indicated. Well, it's not bad enough to keep out of our collection, but it is certainly not our favorite. It's just not the Diana that we know and love to listen to. I think it's a search for a different sound that she should just drop! It doesn't do her voice and talent justice...we want our fabulous,wonderful old Diana back!"
2,Even great musicians ocassionally lay an eqq!,"I have all of her Verve recordings. They have all be excellent, until this one; The musicianship and production on this album are outstanding (typical Verve), but the material is weak. One would think with some of the best musicians in the buisiness one couldn't go wrong. Oh well, I hope she makes a strong come back on her next album and that she doesn't let Elvis drag her down."
3,Different.....and so-so,"There are a few songs that make the purchase worthwhile, but it is my least favorite of her CDs. Marrying Elvis Costello may make her happy, but I do not believe that it has been beneficial to her career. Diana, please go back to jazz and ballad standards."
4,Different...,"I agree with most of what the previous reviews have to say, so I wont repeat it. This album is a departure and I was somewhat disappointed after listening to it through for the first time. But do have to applaud Diana in trying something different from what we have come to expect.Good Production value and excellent performance by the musicians."
1,"LOVE THE PICTURE OF CD , NO THE ALBUM.","I LOVE DIANA KRALL, I HAVE MOST OF HER CDS THIS IS ONE OF HER NOT THAT GREAT WORK. nothing special keep listening the "" Look of Love "" album . the picture looks like a great album but is just boring ,she makes albums like every year too fast ."
3,Dark Diana,"I have all of Diana's CD's as well as the DVD of her magnificent Paris concert, and I adore them all, except for the first one, Stepping Out. She has matured so much as a performer since then. I was disappointed in The Girl in the Other Room; although the performance was sterling. The songs were all of a type, dark and enigmatic. A friend surmises that her loss of a parent and her marriage must have affected the content of this CD. I know nothing of Elvis Costello's music except for what is on this latest CD. Maybe I should check him out?"
5,This is great!,"I've been listening to Diana Krall for a couple of years now. I bought the CD ""Love Scene"" some while ago. No strings, just bass, gitar and Diana. I bought another record for my mom, it had string arrangements, but seemed descent. This has been typically Diana, hasn't it, a record for your mom. She has been somewhat overhyped. She is clever, but a bit too slick and easy. The Girls in the Other Room is, as I see it, is her first no-compromising album so far! This is GREAT musicmanship (is this an english word?). Diana performs with a feeling for the music that is both unique and admireable. I don't care much for many of her earlier albums, I find them too easy. This one I really enjoy. Her best so far!! What else do I like? Miles, Mingus, Monk, and not to forget Polly Jean!! And now: Diana Krall."
2,"Girl In the other room, lock the door and don't come out!!",It's seems like her CD was majorly influenced by Elvis's style. Not like the old Diana at all. Very disappointed in this CD.
2,Dissapointed,Format: SACDI have played the album a couple of times now and it leaves me underwhelmed. I feel that this album is not showing what Diana Krall should be capable of. The music seemed 'complicated' and/or 'technical' in places as though she was experimenting with a new style that she does not quite feel comfortable with. She seems to miss a couple of the notes and the album in general feels soulless. Even the quality of SACD was unable to bring the music to life. A real shame as I think she is capable of so much more.
4,Not a Sellout,"The arrogance of fan(atics) who accuse a musician of ""selling out"" their fan base by trying something new astounds me. Diana has a right to try what she wants and those who don't like it don't have to buy it. That's how music grows and changes. It's called innovation, and without it we'd all be listening to the same song all the time. Honestly, reading the reviews of a lot of CDs on Amazon, I have reached the conclusion that hard-core jazz fans are some of the most closed-minded people around. Of course, now this review will be rated as ""not useful"" by all those who don't like this CD, a typical response of the closed-minded to a different opinion.That said, this is definitely different than Diana's previous disks. Small wonder that those who eagerly awaited a clone of her past work are disappointed. This is a very listenable disk. Open-minded listeners should enjoy it, though perhaps not as much as some of her past work. Her vocal and piano skills shine as always."
1,DISAPPOINTED AND UPSET,"After "" LIVE IN PARIS "",her best album in my opinion,how could Diana make this horrible album.Has Costello influenced her so much that she literally forgot her jazz?Her marvelous talent as a jazz player was totally abandoned in this CD.At least the band is always very good. Great musicians!Hope it gets much better for the next album!Go for it, Diana!"
3,"Bluesy, not jazz","I'm a jazz fan, and a big fan of Diana. I put off buying this CD for some time because none of the songs were familiar to me. Finally, I broke down and bought it. The songs are all in a blues vein, and not jazzy. If that suits your taste, then you'll like this CD. It's well done, but too downbeat for me."
4,l love it! A great Krall-Costello creation....,"Jeesh, what is all the negativity about? i picked up a copy of diana's new cd at costco thinking it would make yummy post-wedding background music. a few songs were so sad and lamenting, i had to listen to them again. then when i thought of elvis costello's idiosyncratic style of songwriting, i listened to her songs in a different way. IF YOU CAN APPRECIATE ELVIS COSTELLO'S MUSIC THEN YOU CAN LOVE THIS ALBUM, AS WELL. my favorite song is 'Departure Bay' and 'Abandoned Masquarade'. Please DON'T honor the negative press until you just sit back and take it all in. it is so beautiful."
1,Off Ramp,"I have been a Diana Krall fan since before she was cool. I Have every one of her CDs., DVDs. I have several CDs sitting atop my CD Player for frequent play - most of Krall's other works, Ella Fitzgerald, Dave Brubeck, Miles, Norman Brown, Coltrane, Stacey Kent. But this one will go into the CD binder, and, unfortunately, probably won't come back out. There's not much here. No groove, no swing, no moving ballads. She left her chops at home on this one. Disappointed to be sure."
2,Why not stick to jazz?,"Diana has been consistent with each album until her latest. Don't understand why she has bothered to select these songs but I guess her knight in shining armor might have affected her judgment. No doubt this will be a phase and she will return to the likes of ""Cry me a river"", ""Besame mucho"" and many other good songs.Still, I will cherish her elegance and tastefulness."
1,It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing...,"... and, unfortunately, this thing swings about as much as Ben Stein on 'ludes. My advice to Diana: don't allow yourself to become influenced by Elvis Costello's vision of what direction you should take your music and get back to what people have come to expect from you - don't fall into the trap of becoming a self-indulgent artiste. Your fanbase really isn't interested in listening to Tom Waits, Joni Mitchell or, for that matter, Elvis Costello interpretations. My advice to you: don't waste your money - this disc is nothing more than a misguided attempt at becoming hip with the Elvis Costello crowd. Perfect for slingshot practice."
1,The Girl in the other room is Dena Derose,"I'm sorry but this latest DK album is so boring The performer is meant to breathe life and joy and pain into these songs. Diana Krall is just the opposite of that. Her voice is lifeless, her phrasing, liltless and uninspired . I love jazz, but I guess the reason Diana Krall is so successful is because, she is becoming ""jazz' for the masses. If you're a Diana Krall fan, you should probably pass on this one. I thought it was a bad choice of songs. S'boring. NOW IF YOU WANT snappyy, upbeat, Jazz Standards from the Great American Song Book, updated and sung like no one else, listen to DENA DEROSE ""Love's Holiday"" or any of her albums. ""Love's Holiday,"" is a delightful collection of standards and two originals that showcases her versatility, resourcefulness and genuine talent.? She's great on standards that have been masterfully arranged here, including ""Close Your Eyes"" (from which the album title is taken."
2,Destined for the trade-in pile,"Some CDs you love instantly, others have to grow on you. After my first listen I thought this was one of the latter but after my third listen I'm beginning to doubt it. 'Girl in the Other Room' is largely a collection of ballads that are, as another reviewer put it, tedious. The voice is as sultry as ever and, as usual, Krall does nicely interpreting works of others like the opening track 'Stop this World.' But sorely missing are the straight ahead, uptempo numbers featuring Msrs. Clayton & Hamilton as well as Diana's solos, which I always felt were underappreciated. I've enjoyed her experimentation with different styles and arrangements in the past but this CD will not occupy a permanent place in my collection."
2,Hope this is not a sign of things to come!!,"I know that musicians like to branch out, try different things. This is how they evolve and change. However this is certainly not Diana's best work. Let Elvis write his songs and sing his way and Diana you stick with what you are best at. I am glad this is not her first recording. The CD is not without its good points, but not what I really want when I buy a Dianna Krall CD."
1,"Didn't see this movie yet, but","please at least get the date that it was made right. It was made in 1959, NOT 1969. Ms. Dandridge had already died four years before then so it's not possible that the film came out in that year!"
3,So So movie.,It's okay. Dorothy Dandridge did a great job and it was eye opening about slavery in those times. Okay film.
5,Tamango,See Dorothy Dandridge in her beautiful prime and magnificent acting. Such beauty and a great actress. It is sad she didn't get the parts she deserved (ones she could show her real acting abilities).
5,Great History,"A small production it may have been, but this a great piece of film history that has received little recognition. Because the movie has received so little recognition and small distribution, this DVD is special. No great special features dealing with the movie, but it has excellent quality for being such a rare film."
1,I can not agree that a good admin book could be like this,I can not believe that a good database administration book could give Oracle Enterprise Manager only two pages (page 173 to 174) plus three line on page 172.
1,Corrections and recommendations needed.,"We r trying to upgrade from 8.0.5 to 8.1.5 and this book was not helpful. It contains hundreds of pages copied directly from the Oracle 8.0 documentation which we already had. Usually the copied text is changed very slightly like adding or removing commas. For some reason the recommendations Oracle gives are not always copied into the book so sometimes you r left with explanations from Oracle without the matching recommendation.Hopefully the authors will post corrections somewhere. They've managed to copy in some of Oracle's errors as well as adding in their own like calling CTXSYS a ""demo account"". They should try dropping it and seeing how their context applications start failing. Bottom line this isn't essential it's sometimes wrong and for r upgrade it wasn't even helpful."
1,A Disapointing book from O'Reilly,"Beside the fact the book is made from Oracle documentation (thanks God for cut-and-paste), which is by the way available on their web site for free, this book may be suitable for very junior DBAs. There is almost nothing inside which can be used in real DBA's life - explanations are too shallow and few available scripts can't help much. So, if you are experienced DBA or doing some serious work with Oracle, this book can't help. I have six O'Reily's book (Oracle) and this one is far bellow quality of the others."
1,A severe disappointment,"I really expected much more than this from O'Reilly. Almost half of the book is just cut-and-pasted in from the Oracle online documentation (which is available free online!)! Oracle should be getting half the royalties, or the book should cost 50% less. Plus, it doesn't cover 8i so its coverage of Oracle8 topics is incomplete and incorrect. I can't believe this is the best these authors and O'Reilly can do. I rate it 0 stars and plan to send my copy to O'Reilly with comments."
1,How can 130pages for 7 chapters clearly explain DBA's work?!,"Can't understand why someone gives it 5*, ... worse than handbook and document came together with cd.I have this book at my hand, it used only 130 pages (p1-p130) to cover all OCP test contents except SQL. unbelieveable...."
1,This movie is brutal...,Like many... i rented this movie hoping it would be somewhat as cool as the comic... however... after about an hour of what can only be described as a display of the contorted inner workings of a graphic artists mind... i was ready to put my baseball bat through the tv.. THIS UTTER WASTE OF A DVD DISC SUCKS!!!! DO NOT RENT THIS THING!!! clean your windows for more entertainment.....
1,Razzberry,After Doberman (garbage loaded with ultraviolence) Kounen got high and decided to bring this spectacular masterpiece (Blueberry`s a movie about screensavers)in theaters. Now on dvd!!!
1,the worst western ever!!!!,Indians make drugs and Cowboys use 'em!!!! the worst western I ever saw!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!
5,"Relax, and keep breathing.","I just watched this movie last night. During the final scenes of the movie dealing with the plants, I felt like what I imagine the guy I had seen as a child in a movie theatre freaking out during a screening of Platoon must have felt. This guy just started screaming ""That's how it was!! That's how it was!!!""If you are at all familiar with plant shamanism than you should see this film. I am amazed at how well they were able to capture the sights and sounds, the awe-fulness, the fear, sadness, agony and eventual bliss of the experience.I hope that eventually the ratings here will average out much higher than it is doing so far. It will be a trojan horse to some, but in time this movie will quietly become a cult classic and will never be forgotten."
3,Really Strange,"I liked this movie enough to buy it at the really cheap price. It is no grand epic or anything, but it is a weird one. Half the movie is taken up by peyote eatin indians getting high - I like that. The plot is pretty grim with Madsen as the bad guy with impure motives and Cassell as kind of a whimpy hero who ""sees"" the big picture thru his eating his share of go-juice. In the end the two of them have a get-high-down in some cave and Madsen bites the dirt in a drugged out stupor. The best part is seeing Juliette Lewis towards the end swimming around in a pond with her muff takin up the screen. I don't know how many people can appreciate her muff like I do, as I don't even know what I see in it, but it is a bonus shot. I like this one."
2,???,Why was this movie in the western section? was all I could ask myself over and over again after recovering from the headach I received after watching this movie they should have put it in the stoner section with a shinny cover so they could giggle while watching the colors dance in the light. This movie actually got a good rating on this website for some reason it boggles the mind a little if you look it up in blockbuster you might find more suitable advice I wouldn't waste any time on this movie unless you are into tripping out yourself. I thought it was dumb but that's just my point of view.
1,Not a Good Western or a Good Film.,"This was a horrible movie, sorry. It was disjointed, pretentious, poorly acted, cheap looking, it had no flow, and the cinematography was awful. Just because it's strange and eerie and plays at some kind of metaphysical significance doesn't mean it's actually deep."
3,This Is How You Can Meet Your Beast,"You don't need Red Bull to do that. It looks like at least 1 indian in this movie would be named Red Bull. Mike battles enemies from his past to meet his beasts. It got all too kooky for me, at least, am not degraded by this stuff to meet MY beasts. I'm not even sure how to actually try it. This movie was not all about that. It has a better plot. Occasionally, there is very pretty mountain scenery, and it gets weird. But I guess that is all part of the quirky entertainment."
3,RENEGADE Had Promise...,"This nice looking and surprising western had a great premise, but was slowed down with not enough nicely cherographed action sequences, along with a miss-cast of the leading man.Hugh Jackman, along with not so high-dollar actors could have played this leading role to better execution.The storyline was excellent, but the pacing and the skinny, boring lead actor made this hard to swallow.The special effects, especially near the ending, would have been more exciting - and more properly executed - if the Good and Evil spirits would have battled it out.Instead, we are thrown in some cool looking images...but quickly had me and my friends saying - ""Enough already!""I love half-breed type westerns, and the filming and scenes in this movie are magnificent, but the lack of a strong lead actor, along with scenes that felt unfinished and/or polished, made this film in much need of some explosive, Sam Peckinpah-type action.Look up DUST. That's a better western."
1,"Worst 'so called"" Western of 2004",This has got to be the worst movie of 2004. Possibly the worst of the decade. I can see NO redeeming atributes what-so-ever. A total waste of film and a waste of your 2 hours.
3,This is really the Jan Kounen film BLUEBERRY,"Just so you know this is the latest work by sadistic ""Dobermann"" director Jan Kounen. It's perhaps worth checking out."
4,Snakes!,"From what I understand, the director managed to get the visions of the drug accurate. The drug they are using causes intense violent vomiting followed by curious hallucinations. The most common vision reported appears to be of snakes.... But also the drug of choice (the snakey drug) would not have been that common in the southwest. It would have more likely been a south american visitation.... But, hey, call it creative license.So enjoy the film. It's a bizarre hoot... And it's got Ernie Borgnine. How cool! Oh, and it's French, so I take it to be a Franco fantasy take on American cowboy movies as transmitted through the medium of Italian westerns such as The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. What's not to love!"
4,If you are into Shamanism get this film,If you have any interst in Shamanism get this DVD. The Shaman CGI journey in this film coveres the entire price of this DVD.I will watch this DVD for many years to come.
5,Cool A*s!,Absolutely fantastic. A true gem. This flick excels and in the process creates a whole new genre - the fantasy/Western. It will become a cult classic.
3,"An OK production, 3 stars","It's not a straight through live concert, it's a selection of about 7 -8 of their more popular songs, intertwined with interviews with the musicians and producers of the group. It's half live concert and half ""making the music"" type of production. The recording is not the best quality, video wise, and sound wise, don't be expecting the most fidelity.It's a good historical DVD to have, but not for conoisseurs of good salsa DVDs."
5,UNIQUE!,"This book helps us remember the unique beings we are, and to acknowledge the unique world and universe we live in. It helps to awake the truth that rest inside us. A book to have close at hand, to open every once in a while, in any page, and read its beautiful paragraphs. The believings of a culture whose origins are lost in the shadow of ancient time tell us that, maybe, our technology can't hide our true nature and feelings. A great book to start 1999, and maybe change some of the purposes we stablish in the dying minutes of 1998. In my opinion it deserves six stars."
5,Book for my soul,"It's a book for the soul -- for my soul. When my friend recommended the book, I first got the sample e-version and began reading. Immediately I wanted to highlight passages that moved me but it wasn't possible for sample versions. I wanted more of the Anam Cara wisdom so I purchased the book. Before I knew it, I was quoting right and left and people that I would share the anam cara wisdom would end up buying the book. One reminiscent of Gibran's The Prophet -- the type that you keep going back to as it teaches you about how to go through life and love. It is a wise purchase."
5,Anam Cara,Well worth the reading. Presents good concepts on spirituality from his Irish view. Well studied with wide variety of ideas.
2,Disappointing book,"Being an incurable celtophile, I bought this book in hopes that it would contain a good basic introduction to the Celtic concept of Anam Cara. However, what I found upon reading was that this book was in actuality little more than a somewhat postmodern primer on neoplatonism and New Age philosophy.Interspersed with a few interesting tidbits of Irish folklore and even less historical study, what the author most often cites are classical philosophers and mystics like Plato, Plotinus, Augustine, John Cassian, Meister Eckhart, Buddhist writings, (none of whom qualify as Celtic, interestingly), in addition to a smattering of modern Irish writers who shed no particular light on the concept referred to in the title of this book.Cahill's _How the Irish Saved Civilization_ was a much more helpful, instructive, and, may I say honest, book, in that it actually delivered what it promised. I truly wish I could say the same for O'Donohue's _Anam Cara_."
5,The Ancient Celts would have been proud of their son...,"John O'Donohue has composed a work of depth and beauty comparable only with the Bardic Tales, the Eddas, the Vedas. One need only read a single chapter to gain a clear benefit from this book.I can see only one way to improve this book: render it as an oral tradition."
5,A change of life...,"This is the third Anam Cara I have purchased after giving my first two away to individuals I felt could use the wisdom. If the reader is able to open the mind and absorb the love that has gone into this book it is a wonderful read. I recommend this book to any individual that can set aside instilled religious views and read what has been placed before him or her. This book gives the reader a set of true, natural values that can cause no one harm and only support the good that we seem to have lost in this world today. It is uplifting, invigorating and gives a measure of hope. I love this book and will probably purchase many more as give-aways."
4,Excellent Overview of Celtic Wisdom,"John O'Donohue truly has the Irish gift of storytelling, and the skills with language to make this topic come alive.One of the best in this genre.."
2,Repetitive,"This book really wasn't worth the effort. Author O'Donohue repeated simplistic assertions such as ""The body is made of clay"" or ""Silence is good"" ad naseum, tying these trite platitudes together with meandering stories about this-old-woman-in-Ireland, etc. Not exactly the wisdom of the ages. I found about six worthy sentiments in the entire book (for example, the idea that each of us carries a complete world inside ourselves was intriguing), but sieving those thoughts out of the rest of the text was a boring process."
3,Anam Cara,"Anam Cara: A Book of Celtic WisdomAn interesting view of the theory that we all have a perfect match in the world. The author also reviews the Celtic theory that we are all made from clay. Traditional Celtic wisdom reviewed and explained as a sort of religion. Whether we all have just one soul mate is not certain, but this book overviews the concept from the point of view of a type of truth."
5,Anam Cara - on time and great title!,"I received my copy of Anam Cara: A Book of Celtic Wisdom in great time as far as delivery, and the book condition was as promised. The book itself is full of wonderful stories and, as promised, plenty of wisdom. Thanks!"
5,Inspiring and fulfilling,"I am not finished reading it yet, but I'm already thinking about reading it again. If you have ever felt a certain way, but could not explain it, this book may shed some light and provide some words for your feelings. Regardless of religious affiliation or personal values, this book is a collection of the basic thoughts significant in enriching one's life. Written in words easy to understand and to read, yet very meaningful and satisfying."
5,Beautiful,"I was very saddened to learn of John O Donahues death in 2008, he was only 52 years old, but after reading the chapter he wrote on death, began to see it differently. This is deep philosophical stuff, but written in such a way it makes for compelling reading. It took me a while to read as I found myself re reading sentences to grasp them again, and on reaching the last page was saddened. But will read and reread it. He had a unique and beautiful way of cutting through the nonsense of an increasingly superficial and empty world and putting the beauty back into it. Something we sorely needed. RIP Mr O'Donohue."
5,A tonic,"This book reads as a tonic for the world-weary. In an age of over-information and over-stimulii, this book reminds us of our roots, and of how our ancestors believed for the millenia before us. 'Tis food for the pysche."
4,Words to ponder,"This is a Sunday afternoon read or before a time of meditation. The author gives words of wisdom,inspiration and comfort. He speaks to the mind, heart and spirit."
1,Vague New-Age schlock,"A friend of mine gifted this to me, knowing my interest in all things Celtic. It's been sitting on my shelf for a few years, and now I see why. I've been skimming and reading bits and pieces and this is all feel-good New Agey schlock. Every page is full of vague spiritual soundbites that have no discernible relation to Celtic culture whatsoever.This is an absolutely terrible book. That it currently has a 5 star rating disturbs me."
3,Enjoyable,"This is a great book, if you like poker and just want to waste time. There is no strategy in this book, it is just an enjoyable read. One annoying part of the book, at least for me, is that the author makes up characters that revolve around real players. For example, Sam Garrington is really Dan Harrington. You can see that it's not that imaginative.Its a nice break from strategy books but its not something you will die to devour."
4,Great Cookware!,This saucepan is fast becoming my personal favorite piece of cookware in the kitchen. I really like the even heat distribution and the high quality feel of it. The lid fits perfectly and stays put. The handle stays nice and cool like it is supposed to. If properly taken care of it should last a lifetime. I once burned something in it through negligence on my part. It would have distroyed lesser quality cookware but after soaking a couple of hours it came completely clean. The copper exterior take some extra care but looks great and retains its shine. This is a terrific value when compared to the All-Clad stuff. I have used All-Clad and it is terrific but has nothing over this cookware and it is a lot more expensive. My only reservation about giving it a 5 star stems from the fact that the copper exterior is harder to care for then just stainless steel. Of course you cannot pop it in the dishwasher either.
2,cellet cell case,"at first i liked this product, but the more i used it,the more aggrevating it became. when in the open position the top piece constantly falls off the phone.whenever i want to take a picture the case is in the way of the camera so i have to remove the top part.when the phone is closed it's great and attractive."
5,Single-handedly taught me Flash,"This was the definitive resource for me ramping up on Flash. Too bad Adobe pulled the plug on this great product, the sun has set on Flash and I've since moved on to HTML5 -- feels like starting all over again. I missing the tweening of flash!"
4,good book but lack of source code ...,"There is no doubt this is a good book. I have bought and read a lot of books by the same author on Director. They were very informative and enriching. But the agony with this is the lack of a CD with source code. According to the book, we are able to download the code from a url but till now, i still have problem getting to the site ..."
2,Good idea bad execultion,"The idea behind this book is very good. Provide people with examples of Flash games and try to teach how they are put together. However, the emphasis is placed on pretty examples with very little teaching. Unfortunately, the examples are not explained thoroughly and a lot of times are left scratching your head. I would recommend this book for advanced Flash users, but definitely not for beginners."
4,U have to buy if develop games,"It' s not and incredible book...the best U ever had....but is useful if u have to develop games, 'cause there' s many example with .fla"
2,Not a deal,"There are a lot of problems in this book: Not all the useful functions expected in a ""ActionScript for fun and games"" book. The comments for the codes are poor. And so on..."
3,"Thin on a number of subjects, but overall a good book.","I found this book a bit disappointing. As the owner of all of Ben's other books, I was expecting the ""Advanced"" version to cover some of the technical details and applications in a more complete manor.For example, the section on the CFFTP tag is just a rehash of the Allaire documentation. Also, this tag used to be in the Web Application Construction Kit, but is no longer covered there.Also, I realize that this book is seperate from the Web Application Construction Kit, but was it really necessary to include the same Tag and Function reference in both books? If you own both books, the extra 200+ pages is a bit excessive.Don't get me wrong, this book does contain several good chapters on topics like scalability, WDDX and a host of other technologies, I'm just disappointed that it left me wanting for more..."
4,Excellent instruction into the more advanced CF topics,This is the book if you want if you need to expand your ColdFusion applications. Very good examples.
1,This book lacks in simple database principles.,"I've found this book somewhat incomplete. You can find better information about tags within the Cold Fusion Studio tags help. For instance the lack of trying to figure out how to dynamicly loop, and display values from a returned recordset. It only shows how to display hard coded values like #fieldname# not query. and then the dynamic name. There was no mention of columnlist after your query or anything. It basically just shows tons of hard coding which I find incomplete. For an advanced book it should have contained much much more. Ben Forta its not that great"
2,It was OK,"I was disappointed with the amount of coding errors in this book. In one chapter, he even has a screen cap of the error message for one of the example scripts! Where was the editor on this? Many of the example scripts used in this book are so error-riddled that I don't recommend it for anyone who doesn't already have a decent knowledge in Advanced CF, just because a beginner won't be able to debug his work."
2,Too many coding errors,"I was upset after I found so many coding errors in this book. Ben Forta usually displays excellent language and instructional techniques in his books. However, this one was a let down. Most everything can be learned from the Cold Fusion manuals distributed with the software and this book is not worth the money spent."
1,Not again,"I should not have order this product after reading someone else's review about loading on Windows 7 or Vista, both 64 bit. To many hours trying to load and than getting files/maps on box. Still cannot load files as product instructions. I thought NG would have put out a better product. Google Earth has more up to date maps. I like NG's support.... tell us your problems....I'm not the first with this. Where are the Fixes for this. Spent to many hours already to tell them now to make it work. Not AGAIN"
4,A Good Intro to the World of Plyometrics,"This book does an excellent job introducing the topic of plyometrics to the reader. It discusses the different types and categories of jumps as well as the varying intensities. It even gives sport specific plyos as well as sample programs. However, this is not the definitive book on plyometrics. I think of it as more as a good reference tool. I would really recommend ""High-Powered Plyometrics"" for even more in depth info on this wonderful method of training."
3,so do you need to jump?,"this book is a top recommended reading from all leading authors in strength and conditioning. However, you should also buy the companion dvd in order to help facilitate the exercises in the book."
2,Disappointed,This book is not written that well. It could be organized better. It reminds me of a term paper thrown together from bits and pieces of other reports.I find the exercise drawings hard to follow. Photo sequences would have been better.Make sure you examine this one at the bookstore before you order it.
5,Power training for all levels,"This book explains, with easy to understand illustrations, various exercises for power, speed and agility (to enhance athletic performance). All exercises have little pictures of all sports which especially benefit from these exercises, like baseball, basketball or power lifting...even more `exotic' sports such as fencing, skiing or horseback riding.The exercises suggested in this book can be used for specific athletic training or to add some fun and variety to your own workouts :-)"
4,Get Kids Interested in Reading the Bible!,"Through the Bible in a Year gives Sunday school teachers and anyone who works with pre-teens a plan to follow to help them read and understand the Bible in a year. It comes with easy to follow exercises and activities. When the kids get a little older - early teens, you can try If I'd Only Known... by Edee Wilcox. It's a fictional, yet realistic story about a teenager's struggle with acceptance, sex, and Christian values. It also includes discussion questions that can be used in group settings or between parents and their teens."
4,"A good, extra virgin olive oil","Bought a bottle locally and was pleased with the taste. I also like the fact that the bottle is darkened glass which protects the oil from destructive light, and that the label has both Production and Expiration dates stamped on it. What the labeling lacks are info about acidity level (which for extra-virgin olive oil should be at or below 0.8 percent) and the province where the olives were grown, such as Northern Peloponnese or Crete. To its credit it doesn't use the term ""first press"" which is meaningless marketing hype. Virtually all extra-virgin oil manufactured today is pressed once. With modern machinery that first press extracts all the oil and there is no need for a second press."
1,Disappointing and Poorly Organized Text,"Given the large number of VHDL books out there, this book comes up signficantly short. Although the title clearly implies this is a VHDL book, actual VHDL is not introduced until Chapter 11; the first ten chapters explain various digital design concepts. This type of instruction is better left to other sources. While the explanation of VHDL modeling is clear enough, the order in which concepts are explained are puzzling at best, and maddening at worst. The terribly incomplete index is also frustrating- it's not possible to look up VHDL constructs or keywords for syntax! My advice would be to explore other VHDL books- this one is best left alone."
4,"Decent, cheap tarp","This is the second of these tarps I've bought off of Amazon in the last 18 months. I use it tocover my 19' FunfinderX trailer and wrap it like a Christmas present, just as others here have said.As I type this the old tarp is still on the trailer but is becoming worn thin (as all tarps do) and a smalltear has just developed. I live in Central California and it was very hot this summer with nearly twomonths worth of 100+ weather so this tarp probably held up well considering. I figure it makes senseto buy these cheaper tarps every other year or so than spending hundreds of dollars on a trailer coverthat will probably only last a couple of years anyway.All-in-all, works well to protect my trailer from the elements."
2,tarp review,"I bought this tarp because I needed to cover a pipe frame tent that was designed to take a tarp that measures 20x30. The manufactures website boasted that their tarps are full finished dimensions. The first tarp I opened was 20ft x 32ft. I called the manufacture and they told me,"" the tarps actual dimensions are usually +/- 3% of the stated dimensions. Two feet longer seems a little longer than normal. Sorry."" Other than the tarps being too long, the grommets seem cheap or poorly set. The moment I opened the tarp two grommets fell off and a few others seemed to be on their way out. The tarp material seems ok but seemed a little thin."
4,White tarp,"As usual, the tarp was delivered exactly as advertised. It material is heavy duty, it works really well for what it's intended purpose was. It is great."
4,White tarp,At this point all is good. I guess we will see if it holds up over the winter and springtime.
2,Reinventing the wheel,"Fish has sliced and diced some obvious concepts and with academic obfuscation made them all shiny and new. When trapped in his own rhetoric he indulges repeatedly in reductio ad absurdum to prove his point.He beats the drum over and over until intense boredom sets in. After he gleefully comes to a conclusion for the umpteenth time I was ready to scream "" allright, already! ""His argument could have been made in one third of the space.Picasso took an object and did the same thing on canvas. But, it sells better in art than literature.Thumbs down for me."
1,"Posturing, pseudointellectual hooey.","All Stanley Fish does is rephrase Machiavelli and Hasan I Sabah. ""Nothing is true, all is permissible, and I will gladly lie to you if it advances my interests."" He's a phony, his prose is repetitive and self-congratulatory, and his constant and shameless self-promotion is nauseating to behold.He is the glib and gladhanding public face of an utterly useless and morally repugnant philosophy, and he has as much as admitted--in this book as well as his other works-- that he'd be happy in a totalitarian society as long as he and his fellow postmodernism-peddlers were the ones making the rules and burying the bodies."
3,In defense of principle,"You cannot comprimise with a thief unless you wish to give something of yourself. This is the point of Stanley Fish's book, and it provides both the point and a thrust to go along with it. Fish argues that many dominant subgroups within modern Liberalism are philosophically bankrupt, and provides the basics for a more honest Liberalism based on a different understanding of tolerance."
4,Super bowl time,"I bought this book years ago, and with the big game approaching I broke it out over the weekend. A classic read, with all his inimitable cliches, and euphemisms, and pontification. It's almost like you're sitting next to him in the booth. Great job."
4,Helpful for understanding the basic of Linux,I found this book helpful for understanding the basic operations of the kernel. It does tend to take a higher level view of things than I had hoped. It is helpful for what it covers.
2,"now out of date, questionable accuracy even when it was new","This book covers linux kernel version 2.2, kernel version 2.4 is not covered. There are trivial comments at the conclusion of each chapter ""looking ahead to 2.4"" which are nearly worthless.There is no worthwhile discussion of ACLs (access control lists).Worst of all, even when the information was current it was of questionable accuracy. In the chapter discussing the VFS on page 334 there is a list of fields in the superblock object. Then compare this list to the list of the fields in the chapter discussing the ext2 filesystem superblock on page 499 and you will see great differences. Why is this?O'reilly needs to update this book. It's a good start, now finish it."
2,No coverage on networking,"Networking is an important part of LINUX, this book does not cover it. They did a poor job or even incorrect description on ""Linking Modules on Demand""."
5,kernel for everyone,"Understanding the Linux Kernel, now is possible with a simple, easy readable wonderful new book."
4,The best you can do without grepping through the source tree,"A pretty handly book - goes well with the Oreilly book on linux device drivers. Covers memory memory mangement well, although it can be a bit confising on the difference between Intel memory segmentation and kernel Paging. Good attention paid to forward looking differences between the 2.2 and 2.4 kernels. It would be nice to see the next revision deal exclusively with 2.4 (lets hope :) ). All in all, a worthwhile book to have on your shelf!"
4,Helped me get started on the Linux kernel,"I just recently started working on the Linux kernel and thisbook helped get me off the ground and going. I do wish it hadmore depth and detail in some areas, but for the price I don'tthink you can go wrong. For example, I needed much more detailin the area of multiprocessing than this book provided. Anexcellent companion book is ""UNIX Systems for Modern Architectures: Symmetric Multiprocessing and Caching for KernelProgrammers"" by Curt Schimmel. This latter book provided theextra background and depth for me to finally understand howall the pieces fit together in this area."
3,Good book but not a good approach,"This book is definitely very good introduction to Linux kernel.But the approach used in this book is not good.I recommend it as reference material.In my opinion, to teach S/W, the best way isshowing Data structures and how each data structure is related each otherin a big picture.All you need to say is problem description, objective and data structure used to solve the problem and bried mechanism if necessary. In doing so, you don't have to say much. Just a few pictures are enough.But this book tries to explain some codes in words.This is not good, boring and even frustrating. Instead, the authors should have excerpted actual source codes.Most chapters are written this way, so for newbies, this will be really boring.This is a good reference for existing code not a good introduction to kernel components."
5,simply the best,"This is the linux kernel book thar makes the difference. Although I 've tried some other books on the subject it was ""Understanding the Linux kernel"" that gave me some answers to my questions. It covers anything (ok, except networking, it is the core kernel book) from booting to other topics with lots of diagrams."
1,Don't buy online (will melt in transit)!!!,"The product itself is great, but when I bought in online it melted in transit. But Amazon took it back and refunded everything so all I lost was time."
5,Pleased thus far,Thus far I have been very pleased with this product. The children like them and take them daily with ease (I don't have to remind them). The price and and quantity is a plus also.
4,These are a little different than the others,"We like them, but my daughter complains that the texture is ""hard""... they are harder than the other Lil Critters Vitamins, but still very good.A great way to boost vitamin C intake."
4,The brief Purgation and Purgatory took my breath away.,"I have not read any Christian mystic who more brillantly captured the excitement of the concept of God's infinite love. Where Luther or Augustine wrote volumes to give voice to the experience of unmerited grace, Catherine of Genoa does full justice to the topic in a few lines.By contrast, the Spiritual Dialogue rings a little hallow after the thunder clap of Catherine's Purgation and Purgatory. The shadow-boxing between Body, Soul, Spirit and Self Love offers little fresh insight and no drama."
5,Strange By Modern Standards But In Her Context . . .,"Catherine of Genoa is an amazing example of activist spiritual approaches - interaction with God through service to others. Her selflessness is extreme, and in aversion therapy approach she describes is loathsome in the extreme. But if one can see what's going on beyond the startling nature of these things, one can see God at work through her willingness to selflessly serve."
1,Battery compartment poorly designed,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, my anti-skipping mechanism did work. However the player lid does not open sufficiently for the batteries to be pryed out of the all-too tight battery well. And this thing does eat batteries!I was on my third set of batteries when I broke the tiny plastic hinge on the lid trying to get the batteries out with a knife. I threw it out in disgust. Very poor design."
1,zero stars would be better.. false advertising!!,piece of junk.. can't even bike ride either wo. it skipping! now have to pay for shipping it to emerson to and back from them.. now should I risk 10 more dollars for them to send me the same piece of junk refurbished??
3,Might Be Great for Really Experienced Players,"I just started playing piano again after a 20-year break, and this book was way too difficult for me. I used to play many hymns, but the music in this book is much more difficult, requiring you to play a great deal of sharps and flats. I used to play ""Just As I Am,"" for example, with almost no sharps and flats, but this book requires you to play them continuously with this song. This could be a great book for experienced musicians, but if you're still getting up-to-speed -- like me -- you might want to try another hymn book."
5,Great hymn book,"This hymn sheet music book is quite good for an intermediate / advanced beginner. It contains almost every ""old"" standard hymn used by the majority of protestant / evangelical churches.I deducted a star only because it's spine-bound, not spiral-bound. That makes it difficult to use on a piano's music stand (having to put other books on either side to hold the pages). I have other books with the spiral binding and it makes a huge difference."
4,Useful for making chapati dough,"I bought this primarily to make Indian chapati dough and am very satisfied with it. It makes kneading dough a lot easier. You could even make different kinds of rotis/parathas by adding an array of vegetables to it.I have also used it to slice vegetables, works well. For slicing wider foods like apples or potatoes, it would be nice if the feeder were a little broader.The blades are really sharp and I would be very careful with the exposed blades.Cleaning is not much of a hassle either.Would recommend the product."
4,dlc-2014c,"I have had my cuisinart power prep plus for about 4 years and although I would not be with out it I do have some problems. The main design of the power base is great and easy to clean, but I find the handle on the bowl will get flour in it as there is no seal on the top .So when you wash the bowl there is no way to clean it out . After 4 years there was a very dirty handle which would not come apart.Also I find the rest of the top hard to clean out also all in all a very poor design."
4,Works great,I bought this food processor a year ago.I never thought that I'll be using it so frequently. It reduces so much work in the kitchen. I wish that it had little more capacity.9 0r 11 cups will be ideal.I would recommend this to anyone.
4,A Versatile Tool for Any Cook,This appliance is used frequently enough to warrant a permanent place on my kitchen counter. It easily handles a variety of food prep tasks. I'm especially pleased that Cuisinart has solved the locking problems that plagued early models so am glad I gave this brand another try.
4,My Review,This is the perfect food processor for the non professional. I usually use it to chop cheeses like mozzarella and hard cheeses like parmesan. It works wonderfully. I would recommend it for anyone that isn't going to use it daily. If you want to use it more frequently than I would recommend getting one with a larger cup capacity. But still make it a Cuisinart!!
5,preparation has never been easier.,Great product. Easy to use. Fast and efficient. My carrot cake was prepared so easily that I have been making them for friends and family. I have recommended this product to others looking for a food processor - it is well worth the price.
5,"Good food processor, reasonably priced","I had one exactly like this one for several years and liked it a lot. It has just about everything you need on it, shredding blade, slicing blade and mixing blade. Very easy to use and durable, pretty easy to clean. The price is good, especially on Amazon.com."
2,An unpleasent surprise,"Beware, as of 2/2/07 Cuisinart does not offer extra blade/disk options for the DLC-5 models. You only get the sizes that come, NO EXPANSION options (6mm, 2mm, French fry, fine grater, dough blade, etc).I received the DLC-5 as a gift and was very excited the first time I used it. It cut great, was powerful, and easy to clean. I decided that I wanted a thicker cut for my carrots. I went online to find a disk/blade and discovered that there are NONE offered. Other models have plenty of options available.Now I'm in a dead end. Does anybody know a work around?"
5,Must Have! How did I do for so long without it?!,"I've owned this for 3.5 years and use it almost daily. In fact, I'm not sure how I did without it for so long. Even my better half who loves those expensive knives utterly fell head over heels for this unit. Perfect for salads and food prep of all types, this is one of the most used products in our kitchen. Great size for small families, it's a little work-horse that performs as good today as it did 3.5 years ago. Well built, powerful enough for most items and sized right. A must have for every kitchen!"
5,Great deal - works very well,"For some reason, I'd never used a food processor before. Very easy to use and very easy to clean up. It comes w/ the standard chopper, a shredder, and a slicer. It does not include the dough thing.A real time saver with excellent results for chopping, mincing, pureeing, and slicing. I'm impressed with the way it handles small amounts relatively well.Remember: If you haven't owned one of these, the blades are VERY sharp. If you have children, you MUST keep these even further away than knives. Like knives, I hand clean the blades immediately after use and place them directly in the storage location."
4,Cuisinart DLC-5 7 Cup capacity Food Processor,"I like the Cuisinart and the price was very good. It is large and heavy, but the motor is unbelievable!!"
4,getting old but going strong!,I've had this processor for nearly a decade now and it is still going strong. No issues at all with the motor.It did always have the drawback of leaking all over the place when pureeing sauces so I had to get a blender for that kind of thing.What is bugging me now is that the bowl has not held up very well and is showing nicks and scratches and even a few cracks. Nothing leaks yet but a replacement bowl costs over $30 and the lid is another $15. That's half the price of a whole new machine!The other thing to note is that if you need to grind less than a cup of stuff it does not do too well. I've just ordered a cuisinart mini processor from Amazon to take care of that.All in all a good machine at a reasonable price but not perfect.
1,Cuisinart disappointment,"I grew up in a Cuisinart kitchen - so when it was time to stock my own kitchen with necessary appliances - I knew Cuisinart was the way to go. Boy, did I make a mistake on this one, I guess you get what you pay for.While it does well slicing, using it to make sauces or doughs leaves a lot to be desired. There is absolutely no seal between the bowl and the lid - if you put any liquid or flour in the bowl and turn it on, it comes flying out the sides and top. Not only does this make a mess, but it screws up the proportions in your recipes.If you are going to invest in a food processor, I would choose either the very well rated Kitchen Aid or one of the more expensive Cuisinarts (perhaps the classics or the power preps)...."
5,Great Machine,"I love this food processor! It's fast and very quiet. Slicing and grating has never been so easy and fun! However, I ordered two of the accessory discs listed in the page and was very disappointed when they arrived because they are not compatible to this processor. The stems on the discs for this machine are not removable and the other blades require a removable stem. So beware if you want to order additional discs."
1,DLC-5 Disappointment,"A Krups owner for over 20 years, I recently bought the Cuisinart DLC-5 at the bargain price (...) Although described on the exterior of the box as having a 7-cup capacity , the instructions inside caution the user to use no more than 2-3 cups of liquid for any single processing operation. I used one cup of liquid. At high speed (the only one other than pulse on this model) most of the liquid spewed out of the bowl and onto the walls and countertop. I repeated the operation in case I hadn't engaged all the necessary parts. Same result. Clearly there is something wrong when the listed and recommended capacities are at variance with each other. The fact that a 7-cup bowl can't handle a single cup of liquid merely adds to the suspicion that Cuisinart is aware of a design flaw and is now offloading DLC-5 stock at an apparent bargain price. It's no bargain. I've gone back to Krups."
5,Best of Disney,"I hate Disney movies. I rented this movie only because I had seen Secretariat race in the 70's in black and white on TV. What a surprise. The movie works. It worked so well, I purchased it from amazon. Sometimes I forward it to just the last 3 races and sit there cheering -- he's been dead 40 year, but he might lose if I don't cheer him on. What a delight."
4,Secretariat,"This is a very good, clean family movie. My heart was racing at the end of the movie, even though I knew what was going to happen! Diane Lane plays her part excellently."
2,Skip this one and watch Seabiscuit instead,"Great cast, but boring movie. None of the drama of Seabiscuit, which had characters I cared about, and related to, and was a much better film all around."
5,Spectacular,"Wasn't especially interested in horse racing, but as so many others, I became caught up in the nobility of Secretariat. The awe and thrill of watching the race live in 1973, and now having access to the story behind 'Red' on DVD is pure pleasure. If I'm feeling a bit down, and my heart needs to sing, this is one of the DVD's I reach for. Thank you 'Red' for your love of life, and thank you Penny Tweedy for allowing him the opportunity to be himself."
4,amazing story of loyalty,"I have always loved stories about the underdog that no none believes in coming ahead to victory. Wonderful movie for the whole family to enjoy. It makes a person believe that you should never give up and you should believe in yourself, and don't give up on the one you love no matter how bleak it may seem."
5,Feel Good Movie,"I absolutely loved the movie. Secretariat was one of those magic horses, that seemed to know exactly how the people around him were feeling. I loved the relationship between Penny and Secretariat, they had a true bond. He was a unique horse that comes around once in a lifetime."
4,Beautiful,"This is a beautiful movie. The animals as well as the scenery are magnificent. The story towards the middle bogs down a bit, but it ranks in the top 25 of all movies centered around animals in our book, and probably in the top 15. This is appropriate entertainment for your entire family."
5,Inspiring and entertaining!,"This was a great movie. I especially liked the fact that it was a decent movie without vulgarity. It was family-friendly, exiciting, and heart-warming. I am glad that a wonderful movie can still be produced that doesn't have to promote sexuality, immorality, violence, vulgarity, etc.Great Job!!"
4,Nice Old-Fashioned Family Film,"This was a great old-fashioned family film, in the vein of the pre-animation days. Based on the true story of Secretariat, the last horse to win the Triple Crown, and his 'housewife' owner (who made headlines herself at the time), played by Diane Lane. The racing sequences are masterfully filmed, and kept me on the edge of my seat even though I knew how they ended. The family drama was perhaps a little weak, in the sense of being not completely fleshed out, but other than that, this film was very solid and enjoyable."
5,Secretariat DVD,"Love the movie, music, and the thought inspiration. True that the bloodlines really do matter in breeding quality. Not just horses but other mamals as well."
5,GREAT MOVIE!!!!,This is one of the best movies vie seen in a very long time. If you are a horse lover or not you will enjoy this film.
5,Great DVD/Blu-ray set,"This is a great set. I like the idea of having both discs. I have a Blu-ray player in the living room and a DVD player in several other rooms, so this way i can play the movie anywhere."
4,"Good movie, good value",Being that I'm in my mid 50's I actually had the pleasure of seeing Secretariat run. An amazing horse to be sure. I like the fact that it's a Blu-Ray/DVD combo and the extras included on the disc. The movie is very well done and the racing scenes are particularly good. It didn't have the breadth or depth of Seabiscuit but still a good movie and worth owning. You will watch it multiple times.
3,Dull,"I got this movie for my 9 year old son, because he loves horses. He did not even sit still while the movie was on. He got bored. It was ok for adults. Not interesting enough for young kids."
3,Secretariat,An ok horse race movie. Had a lot of anger and bad language! Our kids love horse movies but I've seen better!
5,Big Red,"Take this movie for what it is, a tribute to the greatest racehorse that ever lived. What Secretariat did at The Belmont is still beyond belief. Don't get caught up in the human characters, it's a movie and Hollywood seldom, if ever, shows it as it actually was. The accomplishments of Secretariat are legendary and probably will be for a very long time. Sit back and enjoy it."
5,great horse history,Great inside story of a woman's fight to do what she felt she wanted to do regardless of what others (including family) believed was possible.John Malkovich was great.
2,"you blew it, Disney","Disney has control of the greatest of all documents of the legend of Secretariat - the thrilling ESPN SportsCentury documentary commemorating the '35th greatest athlete of the 20th Century'. It is an outrage to not have this included in the extras for this DVD, and a criminal act to have no footage of the real Secretariat at all. I assume that one of the motivations of Randall Wallace, et. al. in making this was to introduce him to young people, but the archiving of this film with nothing else means Secretariat is no more real to my eight year old horse-loving daughter than Mr. Ed is.I enjoyed the movie in the theater - despite a few contrivances, it was marvelous to watch a movie where none of the characters are evil. It should be rented only - Disney should be punished in the marketplace for such lazy packaging."
4,Good family movie,"Good family movie... good feeling story. Acting good, somewhat predicable but nice movie on great story in sports and horse racing. Story was just as much about the strength and perseverance of the woman owner as well as Secretariat himself."
5,Great,"Great, clean movie. A must watch over and over again. Even if you don't follow horse racing, the movie is easy to follow this historical event."
2,Disney's Secretariat is no Sea Biscuit!,"The title about says it all: the Disney-fication of the story of a great horse is no competition for the excellent movie ""Sea Biscuit"". It was as I feared it would be: a production by the Walt Disney factory with pretty horses, wan and wimpy humans, and a story that seemed not to know where it wanted to go. No competition to the hearty, well-told (even with flaws), beautifully and strongly photographed tale of the little horse that could. Another flabby reworked story from Disney... too bad, it could have been a great movie. The bones were there, but no meat. How sad!"
2,Horribly Inaccurate,"This is truly a Disney movie. A nice family movie as long as you don't know anything about horse racing. The only thing that was accurate about this movie was that Secretariat won the Triple Crown! The storyline is really about Penny Chenery's journey and I know they have to bend the truth a little to tell the story in a couple hours. But, the true story is truly exciting; why screw it up so much?"
2,Getting a percentage will make you lie,"Saw a youtube interview with Bill Nack, the author from whose book this supposedly ""true story"" movie was based. In it he admits to greatly liking the movie and having fallen a bit in love with Diane Lane during his stint as film advisor. I believe the falling in love part, but if he truly liked this movie he must not think much of his book, because it's everything this movie is not. I guess it's hard to bite the hand that feeds him, no matter how much he'd like to. If he could, I think we would have seen some unbelievable fangs. When I watched this film, all I did was count the untruths and half-truths throughout, so I can just imagine what Mr. Nack went through. That's no way to watch a movie, so my question is this: Why change the truth when the true story is why you want to make the film in the first place? My advice is to save your money and read Nack's book. The picture in your head will be ten times more enjoyable than anything you'll see on the screen."
3,A little boring but my niece like it,"I think the modern movies for kids are sophisticated enough to be written to hold adults interests also. This was So boring. It was really a huge disappointment I had bought this used for a present and watched it first, now i'm not even sure I can look my sister in the eye after giving her daughter this movie. There are probably better horse moves out there."
5,Go! Big Red,It was amazing and spectacular because it has so much heart in it and suspense during the races. A really good movie based on a true story.
2,Very old fashioned story telling,"While it was interesting to see the background behind Secretariat's story, this movie feels like a made-for-TV feel-good movie. As a horse person, some of what they showed with the horses was just foolish. The BluRay looked nice on the new HD TV with the new player."
3,A great horse deserved a much better movie,"When watching Secretariat, I couldn't help but think it was not so much about one of the greatest horses who ever graced the race track, but more of a film that tries to take the film Seabiscuit and simply transport it 30+ years later. The movie tries to make Secretariat seem like an underdog when all along the horse was seen as a champion. No one in this film struggled for money. The training of Secretariat would have made for a good film but only horse race champions would have been interested.The horse racing scenes are amazing, but all in all this is a film you don't need to see. There are better movies out there!"
4,Good story,"This is about a horse which is probably the greatest. Record breaker in every triple crown race.Something here about how everything coalesces owner, trainer and groomer. This makes a team that makes the talent (the horse) even better.If you have ever worked with a horse or trained a horse, you will enjoy this movie. I'd also recommend that you watch the Belmont Race on YouTube and see what this horse did.For others outside of racing, I think you would get an understanding of what a team can do and how to put together a team. For those who are a member of a team, I think you can see the accomplishments of a member of a team.For those outside of racing, I think you can see a little bit of what people admire about racing, a horse that does the spectacular. Not all are Secretariats, but on a good day you can see a horse do something beyond their capabilities."
4,Good Entertainment,Being a horse lover this is a must see. If one wants to see an all american story this one is the one...
5,Excellent Family Movie,"Secretariat is a very enjoyable movie, about the horse, the family who owned it, and the men who road and trained it. Like Seabiscuit, this movie is as much a story of the humans involved as it is about the horse. Great acting, wonderful audio and visual effects, an upbeat soundtrack, and attention to the societal issues of the day highlight this fine film that's great for the whole family to watch together."
1,So Complicated,"I love this movie, but I haven't received it yet from Amazon and I bought it 2 weeks ago. I hope I get it soon!"
1,What Happened to this DVD?,"I was very interested in race horses and I ordered and prepaid for this DVD ""Secretariat"" some 4 months back. I thought I was able to give my view on this particular disc but it never came. I reported the non-delivery and the only answer I got was a refund of my postage. I reminded and re-reminded Amazon's staff that I still wanted this disc but got zero reply.How do Amazon expect me to review this disc?Secretariat"
1,No Digital Copy? Not Cool Disney,"My one-star review is not based on the movie. That I give 5 stars to. The 1-star rating is because Disney has not released this combo pack with a digital copy disc. The released ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" as a 3-disc combo pack and I know that they can do that with this movie too. I will still buy Tangled 4-disc Blu-Ray+Blu-Ray 3D+Dvd+Digital Copy combo pack BUT, unless Disney decides to make this a 3-disc combo pack that comes with a digital copy, I may refuse to buy this movie.Disney, please add that digital copy disc. You were able to do this with ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" so I know that you can add that disc to this movie too."
5,Horses,"Gives the horse world a new twist, also it show`s how with the right owner anything is possible if you believe!!"
5,Love It,This by far is one of my favorite movies. Excellent acting and I do love that horse. Movie is exciting even after watching it several times the last race is by far most exciting. I would recommend to anyone who loves horses.
4,Loved it!,"Enjoyed the movie very much!! It is a great story of a horse with plenty of personality and courage. The actors were excellect. It is one of my favorite movies and from a person who does not buy many movies, I own it."
5,secretariat,this was send very quickly I was pleased with the dvd. I read the review before I bought it and they were good. If you saw the movie you will like this dvd.
5,Great Movie,It is hard to find a good clean movie that you can watch with your family. This is one to see. I have watched it a couple times and my daughter watched it every day during Christmas break. GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!!
4,"Too long, short on substance","Gotta love Secretariat! Whadda horse! I saw all three races in the 70's and it was awesome first time around. Awesome watching the movie too.The characters are stilted & predicatable & pretty forgettable....except for Penney. The kids in her family don't seem to age very much despite the chronological progression. How neat is that.It's too bad the horse's dam doesn't get more kudos for his successes, all I hear is Bold Ruler this, Bold Ruler that, and from what I've read, he wasn't that great.Phrases like ""in foal"" not ""pregnant."" And it's a ""boy""....no. It's a stud colt. That's horseman lingo. >cringe<The race at Belmont is thrilling, but then comes this ""O Happy Day"" music??? Religious overtones, notching Secreteriat to the level of a deity? I think not. Please. Just a horse who ran incredible races.Very interesting biopic on this horse, but no need to give him a halo."
1,This film is a bunch of horse you-know-what,"A 10 year old could have done a better job directing. It's *sort* of about a horse, it's *sort* about an owner, it's *sort* about the comeback of trainer, but only skims all of them while indulging us in none. You can't blame the cast - these people are good, yet completely disengaged while on screen. Malkovich is hurrying through it as if he's got something better to do (he probably did!) and Ozzy Ozborn would have been more convincing as the owner than Diane Lane. A complete disservice dealt to the greatest racehorse that ever lived. Watch Seabiscuit instead. That was excellent and everything this should have been."
1,poor sound quality,"I ordered this tape in February. Summer is a bad time for me to watch DVD's.Finally open and tried to watch Secretariat. The sound was so low I couldn'tmake out the words. Tried to adjust it and was unable to. Checked DVD playerand all OK. You can only return it within 30 days so I'm stuck with a worthless DVD. I should have checked the return for exchange policy beforeI ordered this, or checked it when I received it. Will know better in the future."
2,not really about the horse,"I'm a big fan of Secretariat but this is a movie about Penny Tweedy and Secretariat, how their lives touched. I liked the storyline: that you can make your dream come true but the title isn't true. Secretariat's career wasn't followed to the end, the movie touches on the fact that he was smart and that he had a huge heart but the race footage wasn't real. They only used bits of the original footage for the Preakness. The Wood, the Derby and (worst of all) the Belmont were all fake, not him. For real information about Secretariat, the horse, I'd recomend Bill Nack's book. Let me also say I felt the same way about Seabiscuit."
1,Bad history,"Secretariat was undoubtedly one of the greatest race horses in American history, and thus the telling could not miss as a great story, especially for anyone who loves horses. But this movie by Disney Studios is just plain stupid and factually absurd. Please read Nack's book! Penny Tweedy was no great saint, and she had little to do with the horse's success. Her husband was no villain, nor was her brother! Stupid Disney mess as always, and with a truly great story! - this movie offends horse people. Just like ""8 under"" - a historical mess."
3,Secretariat,"I was very pleased to get this movie as I have horses and love the stories of horses with heart.The film was well done and I throughly enjoyed every moment. I have been to the Kentucky Horse Farm an was fortunate enough to see this horse in person which for me makes the film vevn mors enjoyable.The only dissipointment was the format of the DVD, it was supposed to be the wide screen version but was not so some of the picture was lost at the edges. I would have paid more for the correct format."
5,Clapping and Sobbing Out Loud,"I see a lot of movies in the theater, around one-hundred a year. I cannot remember a movie that had the audience clapping as much as they did in the showing of Secretariat I attended. A guy in the row behind me was audibly sobbing. I'm probably jaded, but I didn't find Secretariat that emotional a film. But I found it a great film, great acting and great cinematography. I think a lot of people in the audience were horse lovers, maybe small business or housewife admirers. Maybe all three. But I swear I have not seen such a emotional reaction in any film I have attended. Do yourself a favor and buy this film. See what everyone got so riled up about."
2,Eddie Sweat had the true connection to Secretariat,"I was unimpressed with this movie. The title character was more of a prop for the Penny Tweedy character. Penny Tweedy was Disneyized into something she was not; the reality is she was a woman of wealth who grew up in the horse industry, not a ""simple housewife"" who had a special bond with Secretariat. At the end of the movie, a beautiful black and white portrait of Eddie Sweat with Secretariat was shown. Theirs was the true story; Eddie's bond with this amazing animal was of the heart. A film honoring the Secretariat/Eddie story would have been powerful and inspirational, two things that this movie was not."
3,Nice film,"This is a nice. mild old fashioned kind of film. I'm an adult, much given to complicated films, but I was pleased with it--pretty good acting."
5,great movies,"this movie arrived sooner than scheduled ,I would highly reccomend this movie to anyone,it is a wwonderful addition to your DVD ollection,worth seeing time and time again."
5,Great Movie for all,This is a one of a kind moving about one of the greatest athletes who ever lived and the support behind him. Anyone will enjoy this film
5,Another great Walt Disney classic,"I loved this movie. It was well done with no sex or swearing! The acting was great and the horses were beautiful. We call this one a ""keeper."" Which means we will soon own it to watch again."
4,Fun family movie,"This movie is a very nice story that will give viewers an idea of the determination of a woman who breaks out of the mold of the 1970's wife and mother. Mrs. Tweedy is a somewhat upper class mother of four, married to a lawyer. As she is making breakfast for her spirited family one day in Denver she receives a call that will change her life in unexpected ways. She meets immediate challenges trying to take charge of her father's breeding race horse farm in Virginia; from the dishonest trainer to other breeders in the area, she manages to hold her own and continue her father's dream.On a personal level I had to enjoy the tale that gave me a look back at the year I married and remember how different things were for a ""housewife/homemaker"". I learned quite a bit about a racehorse that I remembered from yesteryear. It was a nice trip back in time."
1,Amazon rental,I'm sure the movie is fine but u was unable to view it in any devise I tried. It would never open.
5,Great family movie,"This is not only a great family film, but a movie for all horse lovers. I love movies that are based on real people and animals. You will find yourself cheering Secretariat on to the finish line."
2,Mediocre movie,"It's sad that a mediocre movie like this somehow garners such high ratings on Amazon. Maybe the story of Secretariat lacks drama - but it's kind of needed for the movie. Where was it? I was never convinced that the owner of Sham was a villain. And was there supposed to be drama in regards to Penny's family situation? In movie terms - dramatic tension, character development, pacing, emotional resonance - SeabiscuitSeabiscuit (Widescreen Edition)was by far the superior movie.If you want a predictable, mushy, mostly-fictional horse movie, you've found what you're looking for. But otherwise, save yourself the money and go watch the videos for the actual Triple Crown races that Secretariat won. Nothing beats the thrill of the actual races run by this amazing horse."
2,"Great horse, mediocre movie","Hollywood tries really hard to create drama and build the story around Peggy Tweedy, the 'housewife' turned horse breeder. But it's a forced effort at best. Diane Lane is stiff and John Malcovich horribly miscast. The horses did a better job of acting than any of the humans. It's sentimental, predictable, and boring. ""Seabiscuit,"" this ain't."
3,See Seabiscuit instead.,"This movie was okay. The acting was okay. It was nice to see nostalgic scenes of the 70s, when I was 20-something. The final scenes of the Belmont would be hard to film in a non-thrilling way. But this film was a bit of a let-down, and I think I know why. I've seen ""Seabiscuit"". More than once. It's one of the best movies I ever saw. And it beats this film by 31 lengths, going away. In every way: acting, (true) story, cinematography, suspense, humor, pathos, history, it's better. If you haven't seen ""Seabiscuit"", save this film for later, and buy ""The Biscuit"" first. You'll be glad you did. (And it's probably cheaper!)"
3,spotty cookware,"I never removed a plastic coating from my pans. Maybe that is why I cannot get them shinny? I try to clean them but they never look good. Also, I have a copper pan from revere ware that is d/c'ed. I love that pan It cooks so great, I like it much better, it cooks better,oh It is better."
3,Did not get a chance to use this book,"I purchased this book to get to know Powerpoint 2002 in depth, but my company upgraded to Office 2007 so I had to start all over again!! 8-("
4,Helpful,Purchased this to help teach myself Powerpoint. It is nice to go at my own pace. Very helpful book.
2,Barely Adequate,"I purchased this book based on the reviews and am disappointed in it. Yes, it does show you exactly what to do but the examples are disjointed. Instead of actually working on a project, you make absolutely minute changes to a pre-existing file. In fact, in one section the authors have you open a blank presentation and save it without having typed a thing!I thought that maybe each chapter or maybe the whole book would be devoted to creating a project and that the CD would have the supporting files. I had not anticipated that each section of the book would have its own file and so you never build on what you had done in the previous section.I had used a book on MS Publisher that did just that - you created a project and the authors provided the supporting text and graphics but you actually made something.Perhaps the book will improve as I am only on chapter 4 but I'm not real hopeful."
5,Exactly as specified..shipped on time,As described and arrived on time. No complaints and would order again if I needed again for a project. .
3,too much power!,"This mixer has a ton of power - in fact, the drawback is it lacks a low speed. Even the lowest setting is warp speed - I can't imagine ever using the two higher speeds, except perhaps to power a small vehicle. I mixed chocolate chip cookie dough with no problem on the lowest setting. I highly recommend you use a deep mixing bowl so you don't splatter your entire kitchen with food. Given the great price, however, I am keeping this mixer. I plan to start the mixing manually with a wooden spoon and switch to the mixer once I need heavy duty power."
4,"Good mixer, but too powerful","Agreed - this mixer has got a TON of power!!! I actually had to purchase a high-walled mixing bowl to go with this mixer. It splatters liquids all over the place with a regular bowl. However, now that I have the high-walled bowl, I find it to be a very good mixer that gets the job done. I love the new design of the beaters (no center post) - its makes it immensely easier to clean and less waste!"
2,Noisy & Flimsy,"It may have a strong motor, but it howls like a military jet on afterburers. What's worse, the beaters are made of flimsy wire. After a few uses, nothing very hard, they were bent and out of balance. Now the off-kilter beaters make a terrible racket as they bang together. We had an old Cuisinart food processor that was pretty reliable, so we bought this mixer based on the brand. We bought one of their coffee grinders as well. Both have been only fair to poor. Be warned."
1,WASTE OF MONEY-CUISINART SHOULD BE BETTER THAN THIS,"Yes, the mixer is powerful, but I only got about a handful of uses out of it before the beaters quit turning. I emailed Cuisinart who didn't care because they said it was past warranty. Warranty or not, I expected more than 10 uses out of mixer made by Cuisinart! Very unhappy."
1,Cuisinart Electronic Mixer-Bah,"Electronic controls on a hand mixer are annoying. Press a button to turn it on, then press another button to increase speed, repeat, repeat, then press another button to turn off. Problem was that in no time, the ""on"" button stuck ""on"" and the mixer couldn't be turned off. Threw it away."
2,Nice while it works but that is not for long,second cuisinart hand mixer I have owned in about 6 years. both times when mixer is just out of warranty the beaters break (come un-welder where they touch the food). Cuisinart WILL NOT replace beaters even if just out of warranty. A mixer of this quality should last longer. Do not buy Cuisinart.
2,"Great performances, disappointing sound/video production","Prince is in fine form here. . . but, unfortunately, he's done a disservice by the ""director"" and producer of this video. I've gotten spoiled, I guess, by more-recent HD-quality widescreen concerts with 5.1 sound. This is something different. The image is often fuzzy, and the sound at times actually feels *mono*. This concert is from only 5 or 6 years ago; they could have done better. Add in the eclectic song selection (of the video producer, not Prince -- who apparently played much more material than is represented here), the ""artsy"" (and completely unnecessary) filler between songs, and the lackluster camera work (which often focuses on someone other than Prince, even when he's playing a killer guitar solo), and you have a video that is better than nothing at all but probably not appealing enough to encourage multiple viewings."
5,WOW,OK although the quality isn't as great as RAVE it's still a good DVD. A tease because it is so short but it's Prince and watching him perform is always a joy. It's a definite must.
4,a keeper....,"Now few years back I saw this on direct tv like in 2004 I think but I kind of lost the tape. I have been told they left some songs of the recording, but hey it's Maceo Parker and Sheila E, so why not. I love it."
2,not so impressed,"it was a copy of a cd.....the seller said new but the cover of the cd looked re printed,,no shine....i know a bootleg when i see one. i wound not buy from this seller againps i love price so i kept the cd"
1,Not a Classic like Sign O The Times Or Purple Rain,"I think everyone should see this, but I don't know about buy it. The Sign O The Times Concert and the Prince And The Revolution Concert are ten times better. ""Pop Life"" and ""Gotta Broken Heart Again"" only work in the context of the album. This is more like a ""One Nite Alone...Deleted Scenes"""
1,Haven't purchased or seen the DVD,"I saw the free programming this past weekend on DIRECTV and was blown away! The diversity of music and talent was A+! The question that is lerking at me is the 1 hr 20 min show on DIRECT TV the same showing on the DVD? I would like to purchase the DVD if there is more music than was shown on Directv. Can anyone clear this up for me?By the way, I am a believer of Prince's music now. I saw him in 2001 in Denver CO. Can't stop thinking about the show.. it was all of that and my 1 carat diamonds 8:)"
4,Prince & The Revolution .... VHS,"Purchased from the AllNightSwapMeet ... Received on time,and, as they stated, in Original Case and in very good condition."
2,How to make a bad dvd of a good concert,"AOL music allows you to download the entire concert for free, which is FAR better than this dvd. This is NOT a dvd of the Las Vegas concert; it is a dozen music videos, all of which were created from the concert footage. The director has chopped-and-diced this concert beyond enjoyment. The sound is not in true surround sound, and the MTV-style quick-cuts and wacky angles are so annoying as to make the video unwatchable."
3,Not One of His Best Shows,The song list could have been a lot better. He's a lot more talented and exciting than he showed in this concert.
2,"Disappointing concert, poor quality production","Not only does this look like a disappointingly brief and offhand concert effort from Prince, but the production quality is pretty near the bottom of the barrel -- uneven film quality, poor sound, and bad camera work.High talent potential + low effort + poor showcasing = letdown."
1,Save Your Money,"I like Prince, but the poor video and audio quality of this DVD spoiled the show. I kept thinking there was something wrong with my system until I put on James Taylor's ""Pull Over"" DVD, which I purchased at the same time. I was relieved to find that it wasn't my system. Pull Over is pristine. Hopefully Prince will put out something worth buying in the future."
4,"""enjoy this live performance in the style of Prince""","Hip-O Records presents one of the greatest artists of our time ""Prince-Live at the Aladdin Las Vegas"", featuring the talents of Prince along with special guests Nikka Costa, Sheila E., Eric Leeds and Maceo Parker. Each cue specialized with the style of Prince and his hot band, as we take in this fabulous video with R&B mixed with rock.Entire album is a stand out ""POP LIFE"", ""MONEY DON'T MATTER 2 NIGHT/THE WORK"", STROLLIN'/U WANT ME""(Previously Unreleased), ""WHOLE LOTTA LOVE"" and ""SOMETIMES IT SNOWS IN APRIL"" lets you in on the best show of 2002 in then some. Jump on the chance to pick this one up. Enjoyable video, just like sitting in the front rows...gotta love it!Total Time: 80 mins ~ Hip-O Records 602498606315 ~ (8/19/2003)"
2,Not what I expected........I wish I could return it,"I was expecting vintage Prince. I did not recognize most of the songs on the DVD. Basically, this video was very boring. I am a Prince fan, but not a fan of this DVD. I would without a doubt buy this used if you are considering purchasing this item...... Do not spend full price......."
1,Somebody please shoot the director of this DVD !!,"This has to be the worst directed DVD in the history of film.The music is great, funky performance by Prince, Maceo, Eric Leeds and Sheila E. But this is beyond amateur stuff. I can do a better job with my ... video camera!!If you use this DVD as a CD, buy it! Great.. But what a disappointment. I can't believe that Mr. Perfection let this one out on the street"
1,the worst,"This DVD is a waste of money. This concert is worst I have ever seen. All the songs he sang sucked, his performance was even terrible. And I'm a huge Prince fan.What a let down I want my money back I was so bored I cut it off. I'm not watching the whole thing it will just piss me off."
3,I LOVE PRINCE,This concert was good but not his best. I have seen Prince in Detroit several times over the years and have just fell more and more in love w/ him. He is still going strong and I did enjoy some of the songs and performance on this concert dvd.
3,Loved it for its quirks!,"The black and white, early 1960's movie gives you a glimpse of older Venice, California and lets you hear jazz on the beach (complete with bongos). Sure, it wasn't the greatest written movie on the planet, but it sure was interesting. (Here's Dennis Hopper in one of his ""nice guy"" movies.) This particular edition did not include Hopper and the director making comments of the movie during the 1980s (?)."
4,Venturesome Vegetarian Cooking: Bold Flavors for Meat & Dairy Free Meals,I found the book to be very good but as I have not tried all of the recipes yet I can not give a OK to all recipes. But what I have tried were very god.
4,"An oldie, but a goodie!","This is a great cookbook. The recipes are not difficult and truly are healthy AND delicious. I am vegan and it is one of my favorite veg cookbooks (and I have many!). It really utilizes whole healthful foods and does not rely on dairy and soy products to make great vegetarian meals. This is a great cookbook for vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores looking for better recipies. Some favorite recipes of mine are the chocolate pudding and the eggplant parmesan."
3,"By Gene Selznick and co-authored by Tom Valentine, later of Radio Free America fame!","This book, with Wilt Chamberlainon the cover, was also out in softcover, along with three other TomValentine authored/co-authored gems.Get them while you can!"
5,Scholarly and informative.,"This is the most scholarly work on the subject of Jewish exorcisms in English. I recommend it to the student and religious practitioner alike. If nothing else, the appendix and bibliography are invaluable to anyone interested in the subject.I feel that not enough attention was paid to non-dybbuk forms of possession. Demonic possession, though not as prevalent in Talmudic Judaism, does appear throughout Jewish history. Also, more information on 'good' forms of spirit possession would have been helpful, specifically those forms which exhibit themselves in Chasidism.My only real negative criticism on the text itself is that the translations leave the average reader quite sated but only whet the appetite of a serious scholar. Chajes should consider providing the original Hebrew and Aramaic texts in an additional appendix."
1,Did not like!,"This book was very boring and hard to get into. This is a topic I'm interested in, but this had absolutely no draw."
5,entertaining and edifying historical anthropology,"A wonderfully suggestive work. Clothed in sometimes rigorous scholarly prose, this book is a fit remedy to the spiritual pabulum of our day. Not everyone who dies is escorted by loving family members to the spirit Harvard in the sky.There are ""homeless"" spirits, who can't even find their way to hell and others so purposeful, they refuse to wait for their next incarnation to have their say. They both might choose to occupy the bodies of people--or dogs.If they're the homeless type and Jewish, you might consider bringing a Muslim or Christian exorcist. The spells and spirits they bring will crowd out and disgust the Jew into leaving. If they're the other kind, and they misquote a classic Jewish text, but you don't quite catch their drift, they could decide you're too dull for dwelling in.An entertaining and edifying historical anthropology of a key phenomenon, spirit possession, at the dawn of modern Jewish mysticism."
3,Okay JOURNEY IS BETTER,"I bought this movie off of the reviews given. In truth, this was not that great of a warren miller film. The soundtracks weren't that great, and the filming and angle was just average. Journey is a great movie, and really can't be beat. Journey is my favorite ski movie ever, and It would be a much better buy than Storm."
3,No value to us,In our opinion there is no instructional value or race footage on this DVD. I can't see how this type of product is useful to learning to ski. There are much better videos out there for ski coaches.
3,It Depends Very Much On What You Are Expecting,"Ashkenazy sounds somewhat like Michelangeli when the latter was young. But his Mozart here is rather interesting to say the least. Other than Andre Previn, I have reservation as to whether Uchida could rank as a great pianist even judging from this piece here. Does her sound carry at all? It is amazing that one just can't find anything common between her and her former piano teacher Stefan Askesnase. It is not surprising for some Americans to find Francesh's Mozart subdued, especially for those who find Alfred Brendel's Beethoven an understatement."
3,Blah blah blah,"O.K. I read the book too but I'm not going to whip out all the hooplah and praise that everyone else above does (and strangely enough they all write with the the same abundent use of explicatives and adjectives ??). You want to read a book that interviews flash ""geniuses"" than buy it. You want to re-build the Juxt web site than click Purchase. You want to learn how to use the core functions of Flash ??? Then this one's not for you. But that's just my opinion."
2,Lacking content,"This is one of those cases where the fluff and hype outweighs the content. Had I checked out the sites desconstructed in this book before ordering it, I would not have purchased this book. I was not impressed by the design and coding, and I found their attempts at deconstruction rather shallow. Several key flash files were omitted from the books' download page also."
2,Interesting But Far From Comprehensive,"With only a few tidbits of practical information this book simply does not have enough content to make it worth the purchase. Usability seems to be a term lost in the clutter of ""new and improved graphics."" Weakly borrowing from outdated Carson ideas this book seems to focus more on trendy copycat designers rather than the plethora of fantastic and imaginative work online. If you want to know how to make fancy animations that fit the ""look of the week"", this book might appeal to you, but if you are looking for strategies in effective communication this book should not be on your list. In short cute but certainly not substantial."
4,Excellent Flash and Process book.,"I am always interested in studio process books. It's good to learn from the real pros that are out there everyday doing and living what we all are trying to learn. I think that this book is well designed, very informative and highly articulate. Juxt has done some amazing work, and learning from their process and hearing about what goes into large scale, fun, interactive web sites was interesting. I recommend this book to other designers I know."
3,"Worth reading, but ...",For an art type of site and to show creativity it is very good. My interests are commerical applications and it isn't good. They go to some depth on their business processes but their processes aren't optimized. Probably better business processes than most design companies and wonderful that they described them. Serious creative talent there. I wasn't impressed with their portfolio of sites but my portfolio is worse. You get what comes in the door and that rarely shows your potential. We would really have a feast if Terra Incognita or Second Story Interactive would write such a book!- jim
5,They way children should learn the atomic war,"It's hard for a child to imagine the consequences of an atomic war. But not so hard if it has a happy end.In ""The Bomb and the General"", the beautiful texts by Umberto Eco and Carmi's fantastic ilustrations teach what should be learn by everyone about wars: its better to have doormen than crazy generals, and vases than bombs."
3,cute but small,"The box was alot smaller than I expected, but the pieces seemed to the same as regular puzzle pieces"
3,Campy 70's T.V. Movie,"This DVD is really a silly movie. Kiss acts as if they are just going through the motions in this one because they do not know how to act(at least back then anyway). The movie's plot is that a scientist who makes the rides for an amusement park gets fired because he is ""behind the times"" and he gets his revenge by making robots that do his biding. Enter Kiss, they are booked to play at the park, to help save it from going bankrupt, and they encounter these robots. In the end Kiss saves the day with their ""Powers"" and the park flurishes. I payed $12.99 for my DVD at Borders Books on 5/28/2006 so look it up at their website, I do not know why they want $70.00 plus for this one?"
4,"Cheesy, but hey, Its KISS!!","Yes yes yes, its a cheesy film. Hell, even the members of KISS will tell you that. The special effects could have been handled alot better and the dialog bites. But who doesnt love seeing Gene smash throw the wall, or Peter singing the acoustic version of BETH by the pool?While the DVD almost looks like a bootleg, it played fine and I watch it all the time. And if you dont think the KISS Army will snatch up every copy they can get their hands on, well, then you just dont get what its all about anyway."
1,RIP OFF,Man I can't beleive I am seeing what I am seeing! over 100$ for a crapy copied DVD and self homemade dvd-r media. lol. This is good for your own private collection but not for sale of over 100$ Kiss made this film dinally availble for purchace within there Kissoligy box sets. Man if anyone is thinking of buying this movie please dont. I will give you a copy for free!!! Yes I said it Freeeee!David. (A real Kiss Fan)
4,"OLD 70""S KISS RULES","THIS MOVIE CRACKS ME UP. YEAH READING THE REVIEWS FROM OTHERS IT IS PRETTY ""CHEZZY"", BUT HEY IT IS ""KISS"". ACE HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY HERO! HE HAD TO BE DRUNK TO DO THIS. YOU HAVE TO BE HIGH TO WATCH THIS. NONETHELESS IT IS A ""FUN"" MOVIE. HAVE IT ON VHS, AM GOING TO PURCHASE DVD COPY TOO. FORTY BUCKS IS A BIT HIGH,BUT WHAT THE HELL."
1,Quite possibly the worst film ever made!!!,"In a word: ""RUBBISH"" - and I'm a KISS fan (which is why it get's 1 star)!"
5,I'm glad I found this movie of the legendary band Kiss,"I'm so glad that I found this movie Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park, it sure brings memories of when I was younger watching KISS on tv when I was a child back in the seventies."
2,"""The Phantom""","There is only about 30 minutes worth of actual KISS members in the film, but there is some outstanding live in-concert film from the show at Magic Mountain in the spring of 1978. Some of the show is the actual live recording, not dubbed music. This is the made for TV movie that came out on Halloween of 1978.I believe this video is out of print, so grab it if you can find it somewhere. A must for any diehard KISS fan."
3,Wow I had forgotten how hokey this was....,This was a very hokey film from the 70s. It was a made for TV movie with THE Heavy Metal band of the day. It was fun then and yet silly even for members of the KISS Army. A good way to remember our youth.
4,quick shipping - as described - thanks.,"This movie is extremely cheezy, and that's why KISS hate it so much. But any KISS fan should definitely see this - you will love it."
1,kiss this one goodbye!!!!,The first time i saw this junk I thought I was watching a dubbed foreign film. Its not so awful its funny category its just awful and had stand ins for criss and frehley since they were so high and drunk most of the time. A true piece of kiss crap. This one screams we did it for the money but with Simmons and Stanley you knew that. Rock Bottom awful.
2,Caveat Emptor: DVD-R presentation?,"Unless I have been seriously hoodwinked, KISS Meets The Phantom Of The Park is only available in DVD-R format. While this campy 70's rock 'n' roll sci-fi flick plays just fine, some potential customers may be discouraged by the fact that it is not a professionally-produced DVD. This film is still, however, recommended for cult movie fanatics and die-hard KISS fans alike. Unfortunately, the presentation leaves alot to be desired."
4,Great Book.,"This book is great. There is one thing, however, that one should note before purchasing it. I found it good because I am very familar witht he subject. I could not say how it would be if I did not already know ASP.NET. All and all though, it is a great book."
2,Not as good as the cover promises!,"I have read through the book and I should say this book is like other last-minute-published ones, filled with numerous typos, especially in the code, (in snippets and the final project). The typos and lost parts make it a real challenge to learn ASP.Net using the book and impossible to do it in 21 days.If I remember correctly, this line of TY in 21 days, are supposed to help people learn new stuff in a short time, while in here we have a book which makes you wonder how to solve the writers mistakes and get the code working!!!"
5,Perfect book for ASP developers,"I read this book from cover to cover, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who already has a background in ASP. I found a few mistakes in the code samples, but what book is without them? I consider debugging them a useful exercise. The chapters are very well laid out and follow succinctly, exactly what I expect from a single authored SAMS book.If you are an experience ASP programmer who wants to develop a good grounding in ASP.NET, this is the book for you."
2,Same old same old,"I was very disappointed in this book. It makes the same mistake SO MANY computer books make, that renders it useless to the novice. It breaks the universal, critical, #1 rule in writing computer instruction books: NEVER NEVER NEVER use code in your examples that hasn't been covered yet! Authors of these books have NO IDEA how infuriating this is to a novice user who is struggling to learn, yet after decades of flashy, overpriced new computer books, it continues. For example, in the first few chapters, runat=server is used three different ways:runat = 'server'runat = server/runat = 'server'/...with NO explanation of why. Fact is, ALL of them work, and you can actually just userunat = serverand it works just fine. This book is FULL of stuff like this, and it makes the novice learner want to smash it against the wall. Sigh. ..."
2,Not for the Novice,I purchased this book to convert from classic ASP to ASP.NET unfortunately the book is littered with mistakes which unless you have some idea of what you are doing you will find difficult to correct yourself. To make matters worse the publishers do not even have errata corrections on their website to point you in the right direction. Unlike OReilly who have errata for all of their books.The book was also written against the Beta release of the software and this raises problems for anyone who is developing with the Gold release.This is not the first SAMS book that we've been unhappy with!
2,Code doesn't work!!,"As I'm going through this book, I notice that a lot of the code doesn't work as it is written in the book. I also was unable to download the code from their website and get it to work. I am constantly getting a host of errors though I've typed the code perfectly from the book. I find that the help file in Visual Studio.NET provides me with working code that has subtle differences from the book."
2,There are much better choices then this book,"I have many years as a VB developer and found this book leaving me with the feeling of ""where do I start, and what am I missing?""I then picked up Murach's ASP.NET web programming with VB.NET.ISBN 1-890774-20-0. Murach's book is the best on ASP .NET.Thank goodness for Amazon, I sold the Sam's book, hopefully that person will be able to get use from it, I could not."
1,Not the same as previous learn asp in 21 days.,"I am frustrated because this book has let me down. I expected to learn asp.net just like I learned asp, from the sams teach yourself 21 days series. Instead I find myself second guessing code examples and surfing the internet to get through the book. (And I am only on page 217!) There is no doubt that the bar has been lowered here. But I guess thats just how it is in America where the quest for little green pieces of paper outweighs logic, integrity, and reason!!"
4,A great primer for the newbie...experienced devs may sift...,"The book is a great piece of work...a very good look at what ASP.NET can do for devs. The examples are very basic and are layed out nicely. The methods are taught in ways which are beneficial to both newbies to ASP 2.0+/ASP.NET, and as well for experienced developers.However, I would have wished that the authors spent more time on the topic of C#. Most of the examples in the book were carried out in VB.NET...which is logical, since this is expected to be the dominant method of coding...but the so-called ""chapter"" on C# merely introduces the language, briefly states it s relationship and purpose in the .NET Framework, and then gives a very basic syntactical outline of how to write C# code (which, if you are familiar with Java/JavaScript, won't leave too much of an impression).Otherwise, the book is great, and it's one of the better ones out there. A must-read if you're just starting out in taking your Web projects to the next level."
5,Must read for ASP developers...,"...looking to move on to ASP.NET this book is an easy read, and if you are already familiar with ASP this book will show you what you need to know in the first 5 chapters. This book assumes you will be using VB.NET as your language of choice."
2,Code doesn't work in some cases,"I'm a big fan of Sams Teach Yourself in 21 days series, but I have to admit that this book isn't worth it. It skips around and doesn't explain in detail what the code is trying to do. Having bought Sams Tech Yourself ASP 3.0 in 21 days, I was very pleased with this book. But when I purchased Sams Teach Yourself ASP.NET in 21 Days (2nd Edition), I left, very disappointed. I wanted to learn both VB.Net and C#.Net. The book advised it would explain both, but this is not true at all. While it has sample code in both languages, a lot of the time, it used VB.net. And when it covers C#.Net, the code doesn't work half of the time. I only wish Sams looked more closely before they allowed this book to be published."
3,Not good in explaning Database,"I am totally new to web programming but not new to vb and c++, this book is the right choice for me to get it quickly. If you are looking for a more detailed book. ASP.net unleashed is the best in the market. Not only does it cover most of the basic stuff in 21 days, but takes you to a professional developer.However, I have found several shortcomings of the ASP.net 21 daysThe worst topics are ADO.NET,Dataset and datagrid,which are the most important stuff in web programming. The author just gives a very simple example. I have to check MSDN and my Unleashed for the right answer. I have to explore myself expensing a lot of time. Probably, it is a beginner book.Other topics are generally good."
5,Excellent Book on a beta product,"I have several books on ASP.NET and find this one to be the most current with beta 2. Normally I am not a fan of the ""Sam's Teach Yourself in 21 days"" series as I find the books at a simpler level than I prefer. This one is an exception in that it provides a great base for most of the important concepts. Undoubtably there will be more comprehensive books written as ASP.NET commercially releases, but this is a great book to get a good overall understanding with examples that actually work."
4,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK-It's out of date.,"It's a good book for what I used it for. I didn't use the book to actually learn how to program asp.net. The examples in the book are useful for indicating how certain classes are supposed to be used and there is some explanation of usage. It's thick and heavy.Biggest drawback is the fact that this book was written for ASP.net 1.1. The industry is at version 3.5 right now. You cannot transfer the classes used in 1.1 to 2.0 or 2.5. All the examples that I used were in VB.net, which is in my opinion after programming in java for 3 years before, much closer to java than c#. This was a great book when it was its time, but the only reason to purchase this book now is to serve as a door stop, or if you are running a really old windows web server with just .net 1.1 on board."
2,Not for beginners,I'm am new to ASP.NET and figured this book would help give me a good start in developing my own pages.Although it has helped me start the foundation to ASP.NET I find myself forced to look to other resources for answers to my questions. I found this book full of errors and poor explainations. If you are reading this don't buy it if you don't know how to program.
3,"Not bad, but not their best","A little watered down in comparison to their earlier stuff, but a half decent rock album. Just a little too middle of the road from their previous albums."
2,LOSERS - last song is a REMAKE!,"I can't seem to find mention of credit anywhere...The last song is a remake of Warrior Soul's ""The Losers"", 1990 - LAST DECADE, DEAD CENTURY.Last Decade Dead Century"
5,BACK TO THE GREATNESS,"Being the freak of knowing the entire first 2 cds and some of the singles of Insomniac(spelling?) Dreams, I really believe they are back to where they were. I have to say that Planets was the worst CD I ever heard, they said ""n*gger"" and that ruined it for me. But ""Shoot the arrow"" is a good song but, back to this review.A good song is ""All These Years"" to show the flexablity of their music. ""Los Angeles"" sounds almost like Mark did on Unstable, very impressive. ""Days go by"" reminds me of Puddle of Mudd...Really badly!""Cold and Jaded"" sounds like Adema's debut album like many people said...Overall they are back to the basics and are rocking hard...I am into the new sound! Awesome!!! WORTH THE BUY!"
4,Ear Candy,I haven't heard Adema since their debut. I had a friend lend this to me and I can't get it out of my car. Really well put together album. Very very catchy while still having some balls. Cold and Jaded and Open til Midnight are 2 of my favs on this record. Enjoy. I have to see what the other albums are like since the debut. It sounds from reading the reviews that I should avoid planets.
1,I had 3 sendmail issues before half a day with this book,"And still have 3 issues.I bought this book thinking it would help a relatively unexperienced administrator figure out how to work with sendmail. Unfortunately this book does not give the type guidance that I need. There is basically no ""how to"" section. I was able to find one of the problems I am having stated in the book, with absolutely no resolution to it listed. This book was a waste of my companys money."
2,"out of date, poor tutorial, decent reference","...I've owned both v1 and v2 of this book, and have continually been frustrated by both.Big problems here are that the book isn't tremendously helpful for learning - more of a reference, and that it is at least four years out of date, which is a long time considering what's happened with the Internet since then...."
4,"The ""Bat Book"" belongs at your desk.","I knew nothing of sendmail (or Unix!) when I was asked to implement a new mailhub, mail-gateway, and mail-relay. While I was learning ls, cp, and vi, I was also learning how to compile, install, and configure sendmail! -Thanks to this book.If you're going to be involved with sendmail, you've heard of the sendmail.cf file. Don't be scared, just jump in and learn it once and for all. With this book, you'll quickly master the .cf file and amaze your friends by configuring SMTP mail servers in no time. More than the complete sendmail reference, this book gives many real-world examples you can adapt to your environment.The only drawback concerns the release of sendmail 8.9. With the significant changes between 8.8 and 8.9, O'Reilly would do us all a great favor by releasing a 3rd edition covering what's new in 8.9. Regardless, the ""Bat Book"" will maintain its position within arms reach of my keyboard."
4,Everything you ever wanted to know about Sendmail but...,... were afraid to ask!If you want or have to work with sendmail the ubiquitous SMTP server written by Eric Allman et. al. then this is the book for you. I have been an Unix system administrator for 15+ years and I still run to this book when I have to do anything fancy with sendmail.Every system administrator worth their salt has to munge the sendmail.cf file at least once in their career. This book will at least point you in the right direction.
1,Disappointed,"I cannot believe this material is not available for download for free somewhere. Did we, as tax payers, already pay for this?"
1,Electronic LED that controls speed stopped working,"I wouldn't by this mixer again. I bought mine and in less than a year, the Electronin LED speed control quit working and now I have an expensive like-new mixer that no longer works. In addition, I hadn't used it all that much. No quality!"
5,the healing power of art,"This is an important and powerful book that responds with passionate complexity to a very difficult subject. Clearly the Holocaust has been addressed many times and in many different ways through the media over the past 50 years, but this approach is unique. The artists represented in this volume have chosen to write and make art as the best means for expressing both pain and hope, anguish and redemption. It's inspiring to see how creativity and self-expression can offer possibilities for healing, and this is a message that is particularly relevant in the face of ever-continuing forms of darkness and despair. Anyone who appreciates eloquent writing and meaningful visual art will find work to be moved and enlightened by in this collection."
1,Nice design but poor quality,"The design of these gloves is just what my son needed. Unfortunately, they lasted less than one week before tearing on the palm, on the fingertip, and in between two fingers. The replacement pair started tearing after one game."
4,12 years of everyday use.,"I too find this to be a classic set. I'm afraid after 12 yrs. of usage; by two adults, the most heavily used (salad plates) are cracking and breaking up. I have used them in the microwave. And I believe this was their downfall.Do I still want them? Yes They suite us very well."
5,Mikasa French Countryside,"I have purchased this product before from different retail establishments for my daughter at Christmas. Usually they were out of the pieces I preferred and they were back ordered. Your service was excellent! The price was less than I had previously spent; I was appreciative of that, and the free and prompt delivery; a win, win situation. Thank you!"
3,Good tool for longer hair!,"I have very short hair, and although it's the narrowest I could find, it's really hardly usable on most of my hair."
2,"Do not order if you have fine,long hair!","WOW!This is not for me at all!I have long,fine hair and thought this Hot Air brush would give me nice waves...Tangle free?!Yeah right! I used this on 3 different occasions thinking if I did something different I would get better results,instead my hair got tangled in this every single time!And it was almost impossible to get out.This would probably work if you have short to medium hair,but if you have long hair I would recommend staying away from this.I am going to give this to a friend since it has no use for me."
3,Helen of Troy hot air brush,"I have very curly hair. I was looking for a curling iron with tangle free, ceramic combs to replace the one I have which has been discontinued. I decided to try this product and was pleased with the results. It does hold the hair in place while drying so this eliminates blow drying then curling. The release button works great for tangle free. If there is anything I would like to change perhaps I would like for the temperature to get a little hotter. My hair is thick and course so I have to hold in position for a long time to dry and control the curl. But I would recommend this product to anyone looking for curl control as well as a styling tool. It is light weight and easy to handle. Good quality"
1,JUNK,"Dryer turned on, except the barrel end tip kept swiveling & cap could not be tightened. Next morning the switch was loose then would not turn on at ALL.So I never even got to use it. And to make matters worse the box it came with was thrown out & can't return without it. $25.00 down the toilet.I'm not happy at all. I've used Helen of Troy before without problems but this one is JUNK"
5,Unfairly maligned ?,"I'm not sure why the previous two reviewers had difficulties, and I'm not doubting that they did, but this device is widely used, and has a pretty good track record. I even use them in my home, I have installed them for others, and I take one on the road with me for remote access to my phone lines. Biggest trick is understanding the settings, and not accidentally purchasing one which is locked to some iffy provider (no names, please). Hard to beat for the price."
4,Works like a charm,"I ordered one of these for use with VOIP.MS service. Easy to set up, lots of configuration options and very clear call quality. Highly recommend for anyone who wants a home phone number for around 3-5 dollars a month."
1,Not the Greatest Seller,So I guess I should have waited to purchase my PAP2 until my internet problem at home was resolved but I didn't. It therefore took me about 5-6 weeks before I was able to test out the device which does not work. The seller will not accept the defective item because I waited too long to try to return it. I paid over $70 for the ATA device and now have to go out and buy a new one. I will not use this seller again and I probably will look to purchase an ATA device from a different manufacturer.
1,Overheated and died,"We purchased this SIP adapter a few weeks ago and it just died today. It no longer boots up and will not get past the blinking blue power light. I do not know what caused it to die so suddenly. I have contacted the seller to request a replacement. Seems the quality control on these might not be so good, although I only have a sample size of one unit to base this on. Maybe some other people can share their experiences with the pap2"
4,Not Bad Value !,"Whilst I feel the book is excellant value for money and the Author has done a good job I would argue that some of the material in the book should have been excluded (to save a tree or two) e.g. Chapter 2,52 - 54 and included in appendix ? - but hey thats me trying to reduce the 1000 odd pages that I read !!.Overall Comment - definately worth buying, but my advice is to allocate some ""quiet"" time to read and digest all the material - Not really for the beginner."
1,Not a good book to recommend,"I bought mamy books and do not have time to write many reviews. But if I was really disappointed in a book, I want to write a review. There are many junk Java books in the market. This one is not better than them. The book even does not have a good example to show what a J2EE technology is. If you have money and just want to put a book on your book shelf to look up occasionally, you can consider this book."
3,It gets the job done,"This digital voice recorder is very good for the price. The ease of moving files to my laptop is another plus. The display is a bit small for my liking, but the price offsets that. Great product from RCA."
2,It's okay,"Don't buy for recording!!! I got it cheap, and I still hate it... I used mine for class lectures, and when I played it back on my computer, it sounded like I was talking in a noisy room. I even plugged an external Mic, and still, if someone would say hello, and if that person isn't near, then you can't even tell That person said hello. I also placed music on hear, and it is really clear!!! For me it works better for music, but not recording. If you need recording, go somewhere else."
5,My dad loves this thing!,I bought this for my dad for Christmas one year. He said he always wanted one so I bought it thinking he would use it once or twice and hate it. Quite the contrary. He loves this thing! I haven't used it but he thinks it's the easiest and neatest hair cutting tool. He doesn't mind breaking out the vacuum to use it because that means no hair all over the place to clean up.
5,Perfect for my toddler,"My mother came by the 1990's version of this product as a White Elephant gift and it sat in her attic for decades. I just acquired it and LOVE it! It still works fine! It takes about 5 minutes from start to clean-up with my 1.5 yr old. He doesn't mind sitting still with the vacuum sucking his hair - and he doesn't sit still for much. (I do strap him into the high chair to keep him restrained.) I intend to buy some replacement parts, but will continue to use this product for my boys."
1,RIP OFF... READ THIS,you can get the 13 box sets that are out now for about $370 if you buy them in the three packs and two packsDont wast your money on this BS bundle that will run you $512 if you want the 13 box sets that are out now
3,Same opinion as others. OVERPRICED !!!,I've bought most of the sets at walmart of all places for $30. This set averages out to $45. Too high!!!This should have been priced at $300 or less.
1,Great show but horrible price,"At a cost of $349.99 is way to much although the show itself is very good. If you buy all 10 from Amazon.com it should only be $338.90 ($11.09 savings) using Amazon.com prices. However the first four sets are being sold for $40+ each when you can buy them for around $20 - $25 in stores brand new. Each box set tends to be priced differently even at a store for some reason, older sets sometimes cost more than the newer ones.I do love the show and suggest it to others, but as a set the price needs to be checked."
3,it is a different approach,It is very good to understand the importance of simplicity on the web sites. Not all webs are fantastic if they have flash or animation!! you just need to be very concise!! say the things that the customer need and that is all!! good book!!
1,Very little useful content,"This is an outdated book that has very little to offer in the sense of ""learning good design"". The authors tell you commen-sense ideas, such as ""don't have too many graphics"" and ""avoid tacky backgrounds"". On top it, these ideas are hammered over and over again. Reading this book was a chore: I did not learn anythingnew ... The concepts of layout, color themes, navigation, and many others, were largely ignored. The book essentially tries to convince you to stay away from the newer technologies. However, this is a philosophy from the 1990's. Plain, bland pages just dont cut it anymore. If you are even mildly serious about learning good design, choose another book. This book is targeted towards people who have no prior experience at web design. Even for beginners, this is a poor guide that will take you nowhere."
1,"Boring, NOT funny, and totally outdated.","I was utterly unimpressed by these two fools. They rant about design and then throw pictures of themselves on the cover of their book??? That seems a bit lame and also very scary as you can tell by the picture up above. They assume that in order for a web site to have good navigation and overall unity that it must be extremely bland. (...) Also the book still costs a fortune for a 3+ year old internet book...total ripoff.If you want to learn design from a couple of internet geeks then this book suites you well. You too can learn how to put your face on every page, and use all the pretty pastels of the rainbow! ughhh..."
2,"Occasionally humorous, but mainly fluff","I picked up this book expecting to get some lessons in Website design, or at least some lessons in what NOT to do. What I found was a book full of personal judgements by two overweight and not very funny guys.This book is mainly fluff, with little to offer to make any type of recommendation to anyone."
1,Doesn't get it,"Like the website that proceeded it, this book and its authors decided too early what the internet was going to be and refuse to accept it's moved in other directions. If you can't stomach your plain text internet being polluted with all these newfangled sounds and music and java and animation, this is the book for you. If you've moved beyond 1992, give it a pass."
1,I don't get it,"I don't really have this book, but I looked at their website and it was bad! You should seriously check it out if you want to get this book. Just a warning"
3,Funny but out-of-date,"This book is 3 years old, on the Internet this is decades. I enjoy reading it, but I didn't learned much. The authors seems to concern themselves more with the aesthetics of web design than with the usability. Borrow it from your local library , there are better books to buy on the subject."
1,"This book leads the pack for ""Web design books that Suck""","My overall impression of Web Pages that Suck is poor at best. The writing style of the book is choppy and suffers from taking decent copy from a web site and padding it for the book. Judging by the many side bars and paragraphs explaining American cultural references, the authors seem to be writing for amateur web designers in the international market. The design of the book is just as poor as the many web sites is condemns, glaring colors, bad photography (we could do without the see through Elvis suits - ugg) and poor organization make the book look amateurish.If you think that you can learn good design by looking at bad design then 1+1=3. It just doesn't work that way. Save your money or buy another web design book. No one has topped 'Creating Killer Web sites' yet, and if this book is a sign of things to come, then no one will."
4,Excellent for the Fledgling Web Site Designer...,"The title is what drew me to it at first. This is a thoroughly enjoyable book - it makes a superb reference manual. For the fledgling web designer this book delivers great, generally accepted insight as to the do's and dont's of web design. It is well written and quite humorous, and the software is a nice bonus! Those considering taking the dive into the realm of web design, get this book!"
4,"First-rate, usable content; delightful read.","From inception to design, execution, maintenance, and marketing, WPTS is a thorough guide and delightful read.For many, some of the material isn't new. But that's fine; with so many Dr. Frankensteins on the web creating eye-popping, bandwidth hogging sites, lacking in content, it's a good refresher.My only constructive addendum: too many cute pictures of the authors and canned photo backdrops. On balance, though, the ""content"" -- and the author's credo is ""content is king"" -- is superlative."
5,Sucks a paradox,"Ideas are presented in a easy to understand manner showing how great concepts fail miserably in web design. Ths KISS principle is evident throughout this book and their ""No holds barred"" attitude is refreshing."
4,Get one and start your own database driven site,"If you have decided to use Perl and MySQL to develop your web site, then get this book! It explains all from configuring Apache for CGI, configuring MySQL, mod_perl, session management, setting up SSL, and many more. It has many real world examples of application. The writing style is also very easy to follow.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I used PHP and not Perl. But still I could learn many useful things from this book."
3,MySQL and Perl but no templates?,"This isn't a complete review but readers should be aware that this book does NOT cover templates (it doesn't appear in the contents or the index). There's no mention of Template Toolkit or HTML::Template, for example. (Text::Template and HTML::Mason get mentioned as an aside, but that's it) Similarly, there are three chapters on forms, but no mention of CGI::FormBuilder.Seems like a big omission to me. YMMV."
4,Good starting point for beginning Perl/MySQL programming,"This book provides some solid example applications that the reader can use as is, or better yet, expand upon to add some nice features to their public web site or private intranet site. The book also provides some useful information on using mod_perl and creating your own Perl modules.This book is the ""tutorial volume"" that should be placed along side Paul's other book ""MySQL"", the ""reference volume"", in all Perl/MySQL programmers personal libraries."
2,Disappointing,"I own his other MySQL book which is excellent. This book lacks content, and would have made a good appendix to his first MySQL book. Maybe Paul should have taken more time from his NuSphere job, and added more content to this book. If you don't know the Nusphere story, check out the MySQL site...."
5,Liberation by laughter.,"I opened this book and started to read. Within seconds, I had the attention of everyone around me, and I was laughing too hard to be embarrassed. I had just read one of Larson's most controversial cartoons. It's the one where the woman yells for her dog to run through the doggy door, but she's propped the door shut with a wooden board. This is my kind of humor: sick, but not sickening. I wiped the tears from my eyes and stumbled to the cashier, where I bought the book and drove home so I could read it and howl in peace. This book is marvelous. It reminded me of how much I miss ""The Far Side"". Luckily, I have ""Red Meat"" to give me my weekly sick humor fix now. But thanks to this book, I'll never forget where my taste in humor came from, and who introduced me to it. Thanks, Mr. Larson!"
5,hahaha,great collection of gary larsons greatest and worst works a most buy for anyone who enjoys laughing
1,TOXIC INK - THE WORST I EVER ENCOUNTERED,"About one minute of exposure to the inside print ink (could be paper too, but was probably the ink) gave me a migraine within a couple of minutes, that lasted more than a 24-hour day.I am severely chemically sensitive to multiple varieties of chemicals (mostly man-made synthetics), but was never exposed to ink this toxic, not in newsprint, laser copy, or anything printed.It is printed in China, but so are a lot of innocuous books I've read. i.e. Maybe I just got a batch wreaking of shipping container fumigant or some other contaminant - who knows?Plant-based ink doesn't bother me, but even petro-based ink never gave me a migraine this severe, lasting this long."
5,A Hilarious behind-the-scenes...,"This is a behind-the-scenes look at The Far Side. It amazes me how similar cartooning is to advertising, my profession, in terms of the process, the clients, the portfolio, the frustrations, etc. Includes early sketches of cartoons, changes that were made with rationale, and a hilarious section on reader complaints. Also has a chapter on mistakes, one of my favorites of which was when a newspaper accidentally swapped a Far Side caption with a Dennis the Menace caption. I was laying in bed reading it alone, and laughed so hard I started crying."
3,Mork-A-Thon,"I wish that they still kept Conrad Janis and Elizabeth Kerr in the whole run of the show. Have DaVinci Deli as another hangout place (outside of the record store & Mindy's Apartment). Bring out the 4th Season and final season. Have some extra stuff with it (i.e. bloopers, interviews with the people who are still living actors, Garry Marshall etc.). Could bring out the animated series also."
5,Mork & Mindy-The Third Season,This was one of my favorite series to watch when I was younger. Now my daughter loves it as much as or more than I ever did. It's good comic relief when you need it!
3,4 1/2 Feet Tall,This lamp is only 4 1/2 feet tall fully extended (ad stated less than 4 1/2 feet); a little short for many applications.I wanted to use it behind a chair for reading and found it to be too short.Still I like the lamp and will use it elsewhere.
2,Grace Jones - sanitized and bubblewrapped,"The titles included in this CD are indeed a good representation of Grace Jones's work. The 'remastering', however, is not.Every single track on this compilation has been reworked to dull down Grace's raw, edgy power. It's as though a roomful of suit-and-tie record executives lifted Grace's vocals and laid them across Lawrence Welk arrangements, the result being that everything that makes Grace Jones blow your mind has been comfortably pasteurized for the coffeetable chitchat set.God forbid Grace should make anyone uncomfortable, or challenge their perceptions in any way. No, let's just turn down the volume and put a nice, safe audio bow on her.Save your money, buy the original recordings, and pull up to the bumper, baby."
3,Millenium Series is weak,"BUT this one is relatively OK. Still, If you like Grace at all, ""Island Life"" Gives a more rounded portrait, with early disco tracks and also ""Slave to the Rhythm."" (Don't get both--too much overlap.)I personally think that ""Private Life: Compass Point Sessions"" is a great deal--$15.00 for two CDs of the reggae influenced material. If you like the mood of those tracks, it's worth it.""Nightclubbing"" is also a great place to start. In my opinion, one cannot go wrong with that album, ""Warm Leatherette,"" or ""Living My Life""--all solid albums."
3,"Average, Not complete","Only a few of Graces's hits appear on this CD, songs bring back memories, but you would be much better off buying a more complete collection. I missed the ""next page"" when looking..so if you must buy..get the 2cd set ultimate collection, that has all her big hits! So for me, to fill out her hit list..I have been purchasing what I am missing with MP3 downloads.."
4,"Free-Line B*, Soda Drinkin' Man, A Walking Disaster...","...Demolition (Wo)man.Get it for that cut alone. The decadently droning electrosynth, the whip and tickle whiplash percussions, the 80's rock punk guitars...cool. Get it if only to hear Gracie's S&M; Dietriching about drawing folks to her like a moth to a flame and 'you kept on coming, you should have ran...' on that cut. Deliciously wicked. Blast that one, Walkin' In the Rain and WARM!...Leatherete.Missing from the overall mix: The great ""Pars"" and ""I'm not Perfect (But I'm Perfect For You)"". But it's still a good product. Get it and Enjoy the Mistress. And don't forget to bring your ace bandages and carbonated beverages."
2,shark clorinator,"It floats and dispenses chlorine. Its nice also because it holds a lot of chlorine at one time. My only issue is after 1 season of use, i have a real sticky pasty accumulation of chlorine on the bottom of the shark inside where the tablets store. I tired to wash it and it was a like washing tree sap off a car. I have never used another floating chlorinator before so this may be normal of all of them."
4,Pool Chlorinator Holding up well to the Texas Sun,"Very good quality plastic, has held up well to full Texas sun. Large capacity keeps my 40 foot pool clean for up to 3 weeks."
3,dolphin pool chlorinator,the item is cute but a little difficult to open. also i found it cheaper in one of my local pool stores.
5,What is creativity in Mathematics?,"Euler is the apotheosis. Read this book for inspiration, or just to have your eyes opened about how one person could have so many different ideas in one lifetime."
3,Roar and Sputter,"I purchased this mixer based on the Cuisinart reputation. It did work, but was too loud to be comfortable using. It sounded like the internal parts were grinding on something. It also emitted an acrid odor that worsened with heavy dough. It even smoked after mixing cookie dough. Thinking it was defective, I returned it for another. The replacement was exactly the same. I gave it away and replaced itc with a Kitchenaid 5 speed which is infinetly quieter and I find the slide speed swith less cumbersome than the touch pads."
1,Waste of money,"I purchased this item...a well known name brand---to replace a 33 year old hand held Oster which worked. I decided that its useful life would probably end soon so invested in the Cuisinart. Gave the other one to my daughter at college who is a less frequent user. Well, hers still works and mine died during Thanksgiving dinner--less than one year old! Of course I can't find the paperwork, who would think to keep that? The machine would allow you to go up to two mixing speeds, not the 7 it should have---kind of worthless for making whipped cream! Stay away from this item....a real dog!"
2,Am Looking for a new mixer,"I purchased this mixer about three years ago when my old GE finally failed. My husband had bought it for me at a household auction and it was used, of course. It was a great little mixer. While the Cuisinart has some bells and whistles, it does not do the job my old one did. IT won't properly mix brown sugar if it has a few lumps in it, it just doesn't mix cookie doughs, or cake for that matter in an efficient and consistant way. When you use the whip to beat egg whites or whipped cream, no matter how tall a bowl I use, it whips part of it up and over the edge. Also, my old one had the speed ""uses"" on the handle. This one, I have to go to the book everytime I want to find out what speed to use for egg yolks, creaming butter, adding dry or wet ingredients, etc. It's just a pain. I do not like the beaters and,obviously, they're the reason it doesn't do a good job of mixing. Give me a good old mixer anyday."
4,its all good...,"i like it, but it is a little loud, untill you stick it in some heavy dough that is :)"
1,Mystery Package,We have no idea of how well this machine works.We ordered a 7 speed mixer. What arrived was a 5 speed in the 7 speed box.This was reported to you on 10/30/02. We are still awaiting a return shipping label.Your customer service people have been good about this but that label seems a long time coming. RC May
5,top billing,i have read this book in my country with over 50 class mate and we regrard it as our best book yet. the author have cptured everthing possible in short forma and without talking more than onc about same idea. I am so happy I bougt book and didnt buy many books of same topics.
2,"Badly written, too dry","I read a lot of technical books and I cannot recommend this one. It is full of badly written, extremely 'dry' prose. Simple subjects are presented as being far more complex than they need to be. There are better books out there covering each individual subject (though maybe not all in one volume)."
5,Building Java Enterprise Systems with J2EE,"Could you post the table of contents online please. So I can read it, judge it and buy it."
2,Don't look at all the stars....,"Looking at the number of stars it has got in reviews my expectations were too high...... I am still trying to figure out how to use this book. It does have some good chapters on JNDI, JMS, LDAP etc. but they are not enough. The worst part of the book is the CD which comes with it....the evaluation copy of WEBLOGIC has already expired. WebLogicLicense.xml file reveals that it has an expiration date of June 2000.......the book was published in the same month."
5,Good J2EE book with great examples,"The book has good number of examples in most of J2EE APIs and how to integrate them. The weblogic licence comes with book expired , but the book web site has link on how to down load new licence. The security examples helped me to fix some problems with my existing rmi servers. UML diagrams are some times confusing. But overall it is a good book for enterprise Java development."
4,Comprehensive,The content is quite exhaustive for architects. Programmers can take it as a start point.
2,"Only ""Good Overview"" of J2EE.","The title of the book is impressive and is certain to fool many a serious developer hopeful of ""Building"" J2EE systems with the help of this book. It will be painful to find out that this books gives only a overview of the technologies that comprise J2EE.System Architects who wish to find out what the various J2EE ""buz words"" are about may find this book interesting."
3,Mac users beware,"I would have given this book 4 stars if the CD was Macintosh-compatible, as stated on the cover.It isn't.It's Macromedia's fault for not offering a Mac version of ColdFusion or Flash Remoting (yet), but this book is by Macromedia Press, so I hold them accountable.Unless you have already figured out how to set up your Mac as a server, and/or have Virtual PC running on it, don't look for answers on Flash/database connectivity here."
5,Outstanding,"I continue to be impressed by Akiko Suwanai. Although her technique is flawless, it is her gorgeous tone and lyrical artistry which I find most appealing. I especially like her performance of the Tchaikovsky concerto and find her lyricism very refreshing in a piece often played as simply a virtuosic warhorse. I must admit that I prefer Gil Shaham's recording of the Mendelssohn Concerto to all others, but Ms. Suwanai's performance is well worth hearing."
5,If you build/repair machines - read this book,"Fabulous book on fasteners. Up front it sounds really dull, but C.Smith makes it painless. You will find out things here that simply are not available elsewhere. Must reading for people into cars, airplanes or machinery in general"
4,This book is very very good,"This book is VERY good, it's informative, comprehensive, fun to read and goes a long way to improving your understanding of the ""whys"" rather than just the ""hows"". It's an excelent resource for someone looking to build their own race car. Anyone looking to attach something to something else or move a fluid from one place to another will get something out of this book. As an added bonus in the years since it was first written most of the fasteners that the author found hard to find have become available easily online."
5,Required reading for everyone before turning a wrench,A very thorough guide to automotive hardware.Very readable as well. Mr. Smith is veryopinionated however.
5,Sometimes Laughter is the Best Medicine,"Infertility is a serious problem. Depression is a constant companion during the roller coaster uncertainty of IVF. The author, although unsuccessful in her many attempts to become pregnant, has not only documented her experiences for others but has done so with a wit and good humor that will make you laugh through your pain and tears. This book is a ""must read"" for every infertile woman."
1,Disappointed,"Dealing with almost ten years of infertility, I really thought this would be a book I'd breeze right through. Barna tends to speak only to IVF patients as she refers to the Lupron Loonies. What happened to the Clomid Crazies which I'm sure many more infertility patients can relate to? Not all infertility patients can afford IVF or even feel led to go down that road so I found her frequent mentions hurtful. I really did not laugh much. I expected to be laughing so hard I'd have to stop to wipe the tears or hold my sides but it was just a chuckle here and there. I found her wording to be difficult at times as if she was trying too hard for a laugh. Lastly, why is this book so much money? If you understand those of us going through infertility then you would also realize much of our money has gone to ARTs, adoption, HPTs, OPKs, doctor visits, surgery, tests, etc so where's the break? $20 could easily go toward a copay."
1,Infertility sucks a little less than this book,"I hate to be so scathing in my review but I've read several books claiming to handle this topic with humor and I just didnt find too much about this book to be funny. I did feel that it recycled several jokes and anecdotes that I have already heard. I smiled a few times but I can't say I learned anything along the way and really found some of the one liners to be a little annoying. I generally like to share books that I feel are helpful but to my fellow infertile's, this one will not be passed along."
2,Uck.,"I just couldn't get into this book. The writing just wasn't my style, and I didn't find the jokes funny... Oh well."
2,Some funny bits but mostly negative,There are a few funny sections to this book but overall it is negative. A lot of us infertility patients deal with our own emotions - positive and negative - on a minute by minute basis. I don't think this book helps lift your overall mood.
2,Too Sarcastic,"I'm not sure I was emotionally ready for a book that takes such a harsh and sarcastic view of infertility. The subject is delicate and if you are an emotional woman, like I am, you might find this book a bit much. I realize the author might have been trying to interject humor, but I didn't find a lot of her anticdotes amusing at all. If you're looking for a good book on infertility that has it's share of humor and encouragement, I'd recommend ""Girlfriend to Girlfriend"" by Kristen Magnacca. It touches on a lot of the same points without offensive sarcasm. It is also much more well written than ""Infertility Sucks""."
3,Not a helpful read for me.,"Although I really like the author's humor, I did not find this book very helpful. I am not infertile, but I bought the book so that I could be helpful to a friend who is struggling with SECONDARY infertility. I want to be able to understand what she is going through, and not say stupid things like ""Just relax.""This book didn't even talk about secondary infertility, which is just as frustrating to couples, and I really didn't understand a lot of what the author was writing. Not a good read for me."
4,An oldie but goodie.,"A good way to get Python to 'do stuff' in a Win32 environment. I've found it most useful for dealing with people who utilize an exclusively Windows environment. Mostly, I've just taken my programs that others 'need' information from and quickly tacked on a printed report or updated spreadsheet that they can use. I don't know about writing whole programs in Windows, but it was more than adequate at helping me bridge the gaps I needed bridged. I presume the book to be pretty dated, but nothing I used was so out-of-date as to be non-functional."
2,"When it works, it's great. Problem is it rarely works.","I have now poured about $250 in to Ott Lites and each and every one failed relatively soon after purchase (within 3-6 months) without possibiltiy of replacement or repair. Be forwarned, the problem is not the bulbs (which are expensive but available) but with Ott-Lite miserable quality control. I love the full spectrum lamp but I can never be sure it will light up when I turn it on, and tonight the 3rd of the three I purchased died after only 4 weeks of use. It stayed in its box, unopened, past the warranty period and now I'm stuck with a $100 lamp that does not work. I've learned my lesson--no more Ott-Lite brand lamps. The two $20 imitators I got at Home Depot five years ago still work great on their original bulbs. Ott Lite is just not worth the money, and Joann Stores will not help you if it goes bad."
4,Great lamp for gramma,"I bought this as a reading lamp for my 90 year old grandmother and she absolutely loves it. She can adjust it and it gives her plenty of light to read, do puzzles, or whatever!"
1,Not Worth the Money,"I, too, bought 2 Ott floor lamps from JoAnn, with a 50% off coupon.One arrived with the box smashed and I eventually got a replacement bulb, but the minute the warranty ran out, the lamp died.The other one gets little use, has never been moved, and has worked for several years.Even at half-price, these lights are way too expensive and unreliable. Do not go for the name brand... find something at a better price that will last."
4,By it,It has purple my faveorite color.And long hair like mine.My sister is chelsea churo.By her now.
5,Excellent Introductory Text on ML,"This book serves as an excellent introduction to machine learning. The material covers a broad range of important machine learning concepts and algorithms. The text is well-written and well-organized, and I use it frequently as a reference. In addition to describing the basic theory and mechanics of the algorithms, the book helps develop an intuitive feel for the algorithms and provides examples of how they have been used.That said, the coverage of the theory behind the algorithms is fairly superficial. Additionally, having been written in 1997, many recent algorithms such as SVMs and methods such as Adaboost are not covered. For those reasons, this book cannot serve as a stand-alone text book for a course."
3,A disapointment,This book just breezes through all the machine learning concepts and does not go into any great details. It felt more like an index of learning techniques with a short summary on each.
4,The best book for machine learning,"When I came to the field of machine learning, the book provides me a clear, easy-understanding picture to the field so that I believe any of you can get into the field by use of the book. If you are looking for your first book to this field, don't waste your time, it is. Even through my life in the research, I depended on it most of the time. It's too great."
4,Excellent book for the niche audience,"If you are interested in the topic of machine learning, this is the start book for you. It is quite informative and covers the actual methods of learning and the concepts involved. It is not the most readable but the author does a good job livening it up. For that matter, I do not know how to convey the topic in a readable fashion so compared against other similar books, the presentation is outstanding. For those in the field, this is a must."
3,Jack of all trades.,"Mitchell provides a good coverage of ML subject matter but niether goes right in-depth, nor gives a digestable overview.I'm a post grad student working in the area, and expect to find one of two things:1. a clear & concise overview that can bring me up to speed on a body of research - what the competing theories/methods are, when they would be useful, a review of business cases or experimental results justifying various academic positions.OR2. In depth analysis of the theory and methods of implementation.I never felt as if I got either from ML."
5,Excellent reference book,"I liked the book. But I think author must provide more figures in the book like Duda and Hart's Pattern Classification book. I used the book as master course and I found it easy to follow, interesting and useful book even I am newcomer to topic."
5,This book has proselytized me!!!!,"Everything I will do in the future will be based on ML and just one semester of an ML course & this book has converted me(even though my major is not Comp.Science). Of-course this is due majorly to Dr. Thomas Ioerger and his teaching abilities(Texas A&M), but the book presents all concepts(even seemingly complex ones) in a way that is easy and enjoyable to learn. One of the most useful books I've ever studied!"
4,Old But Still Good,"Given that this book was released in the mid 90's it should be outdated given the field that it is in, yet the book still provides a relevant overview of the major methods in the field of machine learning."
2,Just a brief introduction to ML ...,"First of all, the statistical part of machine learning is JUST a real subset of mathematical statisitcs, whatever Bayesian or frequentist. Secondly, the non-statistical part of machine learning is not systematic or well developed yet.We have used it as a textbook for a half-year course of Machine Learning. I think[1] this book is a collection of many methods from Pattern Recognition, Statistics, Coding Theory, etc.[2] anyone who wants to make clear the algorithms of EM, ME, etc, DO NOT read this book.[3] it is suitable for undergraduate students in light of its simple mathematics.[4] the examples in this book are very very naive."
1,One Boring Book,"There is no real formatting in this book, just one big slob of text. It is very unreadable and boring"
2,Covers important aspects but lacks depth,"I teach AI at the graduate level in a major US research University, and I specialize in the area. The book does cover many different areas of Machine Learning. Unfortunately, the treatment is quite superficial. A student would find it extremely difficult to grasp imortant concepts without referring to other material. It may be a good reference, but I would definitely not recommend it as the main textbook. Unfortunately, there seem to be very few books in this area adequate for a senior or graduate level course."
4,Double Head Wet/Dry Rechargeable,It takes a few uses before it cuts whiskers like i need them cut.Is really great in the shower and works quite well with many name brand shaving cremes and soaps.Would definitely buy again.
3,Pretty Good shaver for the price.,"It works well, and I like that it's a wet/dry. It's the second one I bought, mainly because the screens get holes and it's only a little more money to buy a whole new shaver instead of a new screen.It does an adequate job and it's not expensive, I think it's a good value for people like me who are too cheap to spend a lot on a shaver."
5,Panasonic ES4025SC Wet/Dry Shaver,"I found this to be a very nice shaver for the price. Easy to handle, Does a nice job of shaving on my average beard, and Holds a charge for a reasonable amount of time. I would recommend it."
4,Great buy!,"I never used a better electric shaver before this one ,and I have used a Braun & Norelco previously. A great value for the price of it"
4,Good shaver for the price,"This is the third one of these I've bought. The motor, trimmer and charger last just fine, but the blades and outer foil need to be replaced before 9 months has passed. The reason I keep going back for an entire shaver is that replacing just the blades and outer foil would cost about $35, while I can get the entire shaver for under $30 every time. I may try changing just the blades this time (around $15 online vendors) and seeing if the outer foil holds up. That would extend the life of the shaver a good bit, but for $30 every 9 months or so it's a cheap enough deal, works just fine and does the job."
1,Missing something that is very important ...,I will leave the debate about if it shaves well or not to those who have tried it.I decided to return it immediately after I opened the box. The charger works with only 110v (100-125 to be exact) power source. Very stupid design on something people will travel with.
4,Panasonic ES4025SC Pro Shaver,There is only one thing keeping me from giving this shaver a 5 star rating. The closeness of the shave is not quite like my last Panasonic shaver.The charge lasts for about three different 7 minute shaves before needing a recharge.The recharger itself is an excellent design.
1,too fragile,"got this shaver for 2 days....used it twice and now it's in my trash can. the thing is that i dropped it and it broke...however, i have dropped my last shaver numerous time and it was still intact. this shave is just too fragile....all the parts are made out of weak plastic."
1,does not cut. even a little bit for me.,"does not cut. even a little bit for me. i tried pressing really hard and nothing. i bought another brand for 30 dollars at wallmart and its the round blade type and it cuts but it hurts and feels like it pulls my hair out. and it really doesn't cut that well at all, it leaves spots. i don't know if my bad experence is because i have only tried cheap automatic shavers or what, but they suck :)"
1,SUCKS,"man i bought this thing by reading good reviews, i was convince by reviews but later all when i used this thing, it did not clean cut my shave infact my cheeks where all reddish and at some areas were bleeding...SO ALL IN ALL... IT SUCKED to me!!!"
1,This shaver does not work for women.,I have always thought that a man's shaver would work on woman's beard. This one does not.
2,Good Price but Weak and Featureless,"I bought this Panasonic as a replacement for a better model whose replacement cutblock and screen cost almost as much as a new decent razor ($60!).Let's face it, it's cheap and performs as such. At least it has a pop-up trimmer and works wet/dry. The motor is weak even at full charge and only lasts 4 shaves at best. This might be because it takes so many passes over your face to shave it actually takes longer than other razors.It lacks the ability to use 240V so it's no good for overseas either.I'd have to describe it as barely adequate and frankly, as soon as I get what I consider to be my ""money's worth"" out of it, I'm chucking it and buying a mid-range model ($50) somewhere between this one and my old one, but I'll still probably go with Panasonic."
1,Pop-up function does not measure up,I purchased this shaver mainly for the wet/dry pop-up trimer but found it weak for the task. I had to upgrade to the panasonic 8000 wet/dry shavers. These are pricey but function for 10 mo0nths on average. This latest purchase is my 4th on the 8000 series.
4,"Great Price, not for all facial hair","I bought this shaver for the great price, and it works; just as it says, wet and dry. I've used in the shower and everything, but I can't get my beard done with this, it leaves spots of hair that I have to finish with my blade. I still use it to get rid of my mustache when it has 2 or 3 days of grow, after that I gotta use the blade instead."
3,"Beautiful pattern, great selection of pieces, NOT durable","I registered for basically the entire set of these dishes and serving pieces when I got married. I loved the pattern and the great selection of pieces. It looks beautiful to serve on both formal and casual meals. Over the past four years, however, I have chips in nearly half of my plates and one or two of my cereal bowls (and I'm pretty careful - never had a problem with any other dishware). It did not hold up as I would expect. I have had no problems with my serving/baking pieces and canisters. I plan to keep those and invest in cream dishware to replace my plates and bowls."
3,"Very pretty pattern, chips easily, difficult to find extras","We got this set about a year ago when Amazon had them on sale for a very good price. It is a very pretty pattern but what others say about the chipping is true. We have several plates with small chips out of them, most likely due to some rougher handling by teenagers in the house. Still I think they should be a bit more durable. It is also getting more difficult to find matching pieces to the set. I have had to resort to Ebay to find extra items. Still looking for a set of cereal bowls."
3,Beautiful but not durable,My wife and I like the pattern but this set is not very durable. It easily chips which was a big disappointment for us.
2,Seconds: Warped Stoneware,I purchased 2 place settings to replace some chipped pieces in my dishware set. I was very disappointed to find that ALL of the bowls and plates in both sets are warped. Because they are warped some of them actually pivot and rock on the table. These sets should be labeled SECONDS because they are not of the normal high quality for Mikasa stoneware. The price was a little less expensive than buying directly from Mikasa but there is a reason why they are cheaper. Buyer beware.
5,"great item, but one arrived cracked.","We were very excited to order this item, but one of the place settings arrived cracked."
2,Shipping problems,I was pleased when I finally received the product but it was triple the expected time length.
5,Best Skateboard game yet!!,This game blows all the tony hawks out of the water!!! The only thing that I didn't like is the background is a little choppy sometimes and the game could of been longer. highly recomend this game if you like skating!
4,Best Skater Game on PS3,"I was interested in getting a skateboarding game for my PS3. I decided to get the first game in the series as it was the cheapest. The graphics are excellent, great trick and combos available. The online gameplay is only so-so. The music is really good as well. I only wish that my character could get off his board and climb stuff instead of being glued to the board. There is also a great selection of clothing and personalization. Highly recommended if you're interested in skateboarding and don't mind the basic elements of the game."
1,controls????,"The controls are bad in this game, a big pet peeve of mine is difficult controls, i don't won't to know the ""learning curve"" for figuring it out either, i know how to play video games. This game seems fun and has some original missions to do around the park. I lost interest after the third mission because it takes forever to try to pin the controls down, call me lazy but I bet the Tony hawk skateboard controller will be easier than this trash."
4,A classic,"I am not a huge Barry fan, but this one is worth the read and still worth producing. As a side note: I saw Kevin Spacey perform the role of Dexter at the Old Vic in London and he did a smashing job! As we all know the casting of Tracy Lord is what's key to the plays success, and since one can't help but visualize Katharine Hepburn every time you read or see the play, it is a great challenge for any actress to make the role her own."
5,buck naked arson (eyes of fire) is very well written,"I didn't know what to expect when I started this film, but by the end I really found the characters endearing and the dialogue was very funny. I laughed out loud several times and even shed a little tear at the end. If you enjoy witty banter with some heartfelt moments, you ought to give this movie a look."
2,Mixed review,"The three CDs contain many tracks of Goa trance, however, they are not mixed well at all. Tracks end abruptly and the next starts just as quickly. If you prefer a subtle mix from one track to the next as Tiesto, Armin Van Buuren, Ronski Speed, and others have perfected, then this set is not for you.The song selection is Goa trance, however, the songs quickly turn into repetitive techno. Not many tracks stand out from the rest.I give this compilation 2 stars for the 3CD value. However, I'm planning to give the set away as it isn't strong enough to stay in my music collection."
5,Hideo3,"This is a very good saw. As soon as I got it I cut down 6 trees with 3"" diameter trunks and about 8 bushes with 1"" diameter trunks. Also pruned a bunch of palm fronds. The saw cut smoothly and without much effort. This my second G-saw. The first was borrowed but never returned. I would highly recommend this saw"
1,"Cheap, terrible quality clamp","The clamp used inside of this fitting is pathetic. You put any tension on it and it strips away leaving you with a useless fitting. Total cheap, junk. It looks pretty in the picture, however, will not hold up. Who wants a clamp that is a poor design and will fail?"
4,keypad,For everyone who owns a laptop this is a necessity if you enter numbers frequently. The keys are big enough and installation was a snap. It sure beats hunting for those number keys on a laptop keyboard.
2,Really don't like it,"First off, I don't think there's anything functionally wrong with this item. Unfortunately, I use it on my laptop, which is located on my LAP. I don't have a whole lot of space to rest the pad on and still be able to use my mouse. If I had considered that before purchase, I would have just gotten a wireless one. I also don't like the keys. I was under the impression that the keys were going to be more like laptop keys than regular keyboard keys. I don't like the regular keys, and therefore don't like the keys of this key pad. Also, the 0 key is small, and where it might extend into the pad (thereby making it larger like other key pads), there is an awkward 000 key. I don't like that feature. Overall, I would not buy this again.Also, this is from Amazon, and yet arrived in molded plastic. I thought they had the ""frustration free packaging""?"
4,Works like a regular ten key on a keyboard,Doesn't lag and is very responsive. No scratches or dents when it arrived. I would recommend this to anyone that needs this.I mainly needed it because I have no ten-key on my keyboard.
2,No Mac OS,"Does not work on Mac OS Tiger or earlier. Seems to work okay on later Mac OS and probably Windows.It also doesn't send a real numlock key when you press it, and when numlock is off, it sends arrow keys instead of real numpad keys so it didn't work so well for some old computer games. But I'm sure it works fine if all you want to do is type spreadsheets into Microsoft Windows."
1,Obviously not MAC compatible!!!,"Great disappointment. Plugged in this equipment and tried typing in all the applications I own (Excel, Word, FreeHand among others) and displayed typed numbers (when it did) with extra spaces and squared characters. Should specify in the product description that is NOT MAC compatible. I'm not aware if PC users faced this problem as well."
3,Yes! I made it work with my Mac and here is how,"----------(The item I am reviewing is Targus PAUK10U USB Keypad)----------This doesn't work with a mac unless...Do exactly as I say and it will work fine:1. When your Targus keypad is disconnected press and hold the Num Lock button.2. Connect your Targus Keypad USB cable to your mac USB port (not a hub) while still pressing and holding the Num Lock key.3. When the Num Lock green LED light goes on, wait for exactly at least three seconds (count 1, 2, 3) then release the Num Lock Key.4. Now it shouldn't Beep and it will work fine in programs like Excel.-----------I am typing a bunch of numbers on it as a proof below:123456789 0 000 . / * - +It works smoothly.-----------I gave it three stars only for being such a hassle to use on macs when any stupid USB keyboard would just work.I have a MacBook (latest intel black model) running mac OS X 10.5.6-----------I hope that was helpful."
1,NOT for Accountants and other Finance types!,"If you're a wiz at 10-key, this is NOT the keypad for you. I'm an accountant and the last thing I want to worry about is wondering if the number key I pressed actually registered. My Targus USB Mobile Mini requires me to put the keypad very, very carefully or I'll have missing numbers. I have never experienced this problem on a keyboard numeric keypad -- they all seem to have the tactile response of a calculator. I would not recommend this item, it is sitting in my desk drawer right now. I pulled out my old keyboard and hooked it up to my laptop to get access to the numeric keypad."
4,It Works,"I certainly wish it were smaller, but I guess that'd be hard to manage while retaining the feel of a normal keypad. The unit works well and adds some features that would probably be handy for spreadsheet work, like enter and backspace keys."
2,Not Mac compatable,"The product description should be more specific--this product was made with Windows Vista in mind. It is not compatable with Macintosh computers, so I don't know if it's any good or not."
1,Did not work right out the package,"I bought this brand new via Amazon from Tiger Direct. Three of the keys stuck when pressed and had to be pried up. A fourth key didn't register anything even when pressed. I can't comment on how well it works connected to a computer as given the problems I haven't even connected it. I contacted Targus to obtain a authorization number (as directed by Tiger Direct) and they had no idea what we were asking for and suggested we just return it to Tiger. Tiger will not allow us to return it without an authorization number! Therefore, I am stuck with it and recommend you don't fall into the same trap."
4,Solid device - flawless on a Mac,"I tried it with and without the previous poster's suggestion about holding numlock and the keypad worked flawlessly with my last gen MacBook Pro.I wish the keys were tighter as they feel cheap but hey, it's cheap and SO much better than hunting and pecking on this blasted regular number portion of the MacBook keyboard."
3,Does not match item description,"The Targus PAUK10U Ultra Mini USB Keypad works great. It was simple to set up (plug and play) and response time is solid. No issues with functionality. My main issue is the item shipped was not the item ordered. My Keypad did not have the 2 USB hubs imbedded in the keypad. So therefore, I had to go out and buy a 4 port USB hub because the keypad took the last USB connector. Had I known, I would not have bought this product as the price should have been closer to $10 without the 2 additional USB connectors. Don't know why I was shipped something that did not match the description, but I need the product so sending it back would be a waste of time.."
2,Unreliable,"I am an accountant and have used Targus keypads for years. The one I most recently have used is the PAUK10U. Last week, it randomly started leaving out numbers if I typed too fast. It doesn't matter how deliberate my keystrokes are. I figured maybe it was getting old and just needed to be replaced so I just purchased another and I'm having the same problem. I went to Targus' website to see if there is an updated driver, but the link to their downloads says page not found. After reading similar reviews, I'm thinking it is this product. I'm going to return it and try a different, better rated brand."
4,Making my job easier,"I use it almost everyday! It is so much easier to use a USB keypad then it is to use the keypad on a keyboard. You can place it anywhere you want, it is more ergonomic for your wrist and able to have easier access to. If However, if I could change one thing it would be to delete the ""000"" key and replace it with ""00."" Targus products have been reliable for me. Great product for a reasonable price."
3,Works...almost....,"Works as a keypad should in most applications. One minor complaint is that in Sid Meier's Pirates the keypad definitely does not work as it is supposed to. I didn't buy this product for the purpose of playing this game, but an item as simple as a keypad should work universally without a problem. Hopefully I will not find myself using an application for work that this keypad is incompatible with."
1,NOT MAC COMPATIBLE,"Despite what the package may state, this product is not mac compatible. I bought this product specifically to work in excel spread sheets and that is the only program it doesn't seem to work in. The packaging is completely false. I will never buy another Targus product. IF YOU OWN A MAC, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!"
5,Efficient Keypad,"I haven't used this keypad a whole lot, but I have tested it out and it seems great!I'm used to the keyboard's keypad where there is room to move your fingers so when I first used this, it felt kind of weird.I had to move my fingers close together and curl it up a bit.Overall, this is good for quick use. Longtime use of this can give you a cramp."
5,Targus keypad makes life easier,Using the keypad has been very easy. I use it at work and the built in hub is great. My laptop only has 3 ports on it so having the extra ports is great.
3,Short cord!,Cord is too short for use with a desktop computer. Only buy this one if you intend to use it for travel or laptop use.I had to order a USB extension cord to make this usable with my desktop.
3,"Just got it working right, thanks to a helpful hint from Amazon users","I didn't even realize the extra bonus for using this with my macbook pro is that now I have page up and page down buttons! the stupid thing is that you have to hold down the num lock button while you attach the device and keep it held down for at least 3 seconds after.I also took off a star because the USB ports are 1.1, which is slower than 2.0- but at least I get an extra port in the process. All told, its a simple solution for my needs at a fairly reasonable price."
5,Lovely accent light.,"I would not call it an illumination, but a lovely, eery accent light.Have 4 of these lights bought this summer, poked 2 in the ground, 2 on the deck rails to compete with the moonlight.Eager to get more. It depends somewhat on how the rechargeable battery holds up through the winter, though it would be nice to have them for Xmas.-Spiders love to spin their cocoons around the battery positive end to effectively disable it.The disassembly and cleaning is easy with a small Phillips manual screwdriver to make sure not to strip the plastic screw tread.Got mine at Biglots, at 3 bucks each, plus 6% sales tax. I will not buy them on the web: shipping cost is ludicrous."
1,Let the Buyer Beware,I ordered this UNRATED VHS version and received the 80 minute R-rated version. I sent it back without watching it.
2,KC watch review,"The price was great, and the delivery was quick, however, when it was opened at christmas it was broken. The pin to change the time was off and in the bottom of the box. After christmas, the date indicated it should have been returned 10 days from purchase, not from Christmas. I am getting it repaired, but probably won't do business with that company again. I take responsibility for not reading the fine print."
1,Petroleum based dyes in here,"My daughter is allergic to all artificial food colors. We have faithfully used the L'il Critter Gummy Vites. She has really liked them. They have been made with vegetable based colors. These ones have red #40, red #3,yellow #6 and blue #1. I'm really not sure why they decided to add the petroleum based dyes to these ones. They are not vibrant neon colors. They are still the same colors as the vegetable based gummy vites. Probably less expensive. I am giving them a star because they do taste good, just not for those with allergies or sensitivities to dyes."
1,if i could rate this less i would!,"this is by far the worst book i have ever read! if you are looking for something light, entertaining or even slightly comedic then keep looking past this book. The plot is slow and seemingly never ending, extremely unrealistic. At most this book is depressing."
3,BREASTFEEDING PROBLEMS LANDS YOU IN JAIL!!!!!!!,Most women know what its like to have just had a baby and it starts crying and your milk starts flowing and drenching the front of your top even though you have nursing pads on.But Maddy is in Harrods so grabs some frozen peas and puts them inside her top to stop the aching breasts until she can go outside side and feed her son.Alarm bell ring and everyone rushes outside of harrods. Maddys sits on the steps and starts to breastfeed. The security guard tells her to stop and that it is not the place for it. Well Maddy lets fly verbally at him she is only breastfeeding. The guard calls the police because he has seen the frozen peas under her clothing which she swears she forgot about and she ends up in the lockup with her baby.The overall story is brilliant. It just needs the 50% of the crudity taken out. But if you like crude jokes this story is for you. (without the crudity i would have given it a 5 star)
1,How embarassing! Thankfully it's a forgettable read,"This is another C grade novel from Ms Lette, who hit her peak in her teenage years with the book Puberty Blues (co written, incidently). Mad Cows offers the reader another unbelievable plot, unlikeable characters and those irritating recycled puns that Kathy is fond of using time and time again (in interviews, in the paper, on TV, etc.)This book was turned into a straight to video movie that rivals ""Blow Dry"" as the worst British comedy ever made.And what a shame, considering that Lette is married to such a classy guy, the QC Geoffrey Robertson, human rights lawyer.Argh!"
2,foxy lady on cover makes 4 bad reading,"this book was sort of bad... i didnt really enjoy it...it was supposed 2 be funny but not being a mother i guess i couldnt see the humor... i guess the author only writes 4 a certain audience...obviously not me. but whatever....its cool, no offense... 2 the point, the book was pretty boring, not that funny, pretty predictable, w/ a weak ending..."
5,"An absolute ""must-have"" for physical education instructors","Written by exercise science professors Neil Dougherty & Linda Carpenter and attorney/sports official Alan Goldberger, an Sport, Physical Activity, and the Law is a no-nonsense, in-depth survey of the American legal system as it applies to sports and physical activity. Now in an updated third edition, Sport, Physical Activity, and the Law covers first, fourth, and fifth amendment issues in sports; legal responsibility for participant safety; legal issues of exclusion versus inclusion; and much more. The text is accessible to readers of all background without being dumbed down, and is especially helpful for its in-depth descriptions of common legal pitfalls. An absolute ""must-have"" for physical education instructors, sports coaches, and anyone else involved in teaching, conducting, or supervising sports and physical activity, particularly when responsible for minors."
2,Wait for a REAL Java Crypto book,"Java Cryptography was the first O'Reilly book I found disapointing. I had expected a book like this to contain examples of really cool encryption, demonstrating the usefulness of the Java Cryptography Extensions. I had expected it to at least offer an implementation of RSA, and possibly SSL (secure socket layers). The book was disapointing, there is no CD containing source code or the required Java Cryptography Extensions, and by the books own omission, some of the examples aren't even available online.I understand that the publishers were limited by US export laws, but without solid examples of things Java developers might want to write (SSL), without the JCE which international readers will be unable to obtain, this book was extremely disappointing."
1,If I could have given this zero stars I would have.,Do not waste your money or time. This is a very poor book and is very much out of date.
1,kinda disappointed,"broken at the bottom. and received it too late. also the brush is too tough like plastic weapon, i don't want to destroy my seats.It smells good, though."
5,Does what it says!,"I purchased this products in the hopes of saving myself from having to hire a professional cleaner and it works exactly as stated! The armrest of my cream colored sofa was a shade of grey at this point and I was not sure anything would work. This product did exactly what it said. My sofa including the armrest are now back to cream color. Easy to use, no bad smell, dries quickly and a little goes a long way. I used with a brush. Would recommend highly!"
2,Didn't work for my Room and Board Microsuede couch,"I bought this to clean my Room and Board brand microsuede couch. It didn't work at all, and I followed all the directions. When we bought the couch they recommended cleaning with babywipes or water. But there are stains that are fairly permanent that I hoped Blue would clean. I guess it's the wrong material."
5,"Was skeptical, but worked fantastic!","I bought a used car that looked like it had never had its fabric interior cleaned ever. I was resigned to having to buy seat covers, but wanted to give an upholstery cleaner a last shot. Bought this after reading the positive reviews and extremely impressed by it! Did exactly what the bottle said to do: spray liberally, work in with a wire brush, wipe off. And it removed 90% of the accumulated stains and dirt from the seats! I used it in combination with a Mothers wire brush and couldn't be happier with the results."
1,Disappointed,"I have used Blue Coral Upholstery cleaner for about 10 plus years and have loved it. It got every stain out of ties, suits,rugs, just about anything. I have never used it on a fabric and not have it work. Now we have a new Coral Cleaner and it does not work on ties or suits. If I knew this change was coming I would have stocked up on the old stuff. I am really disappointed and will have to look for a new product. These days the present good quality would not have gotten off the sale shelf years ago. I am waiting to hear that everying is just the same as before, but it really isn't or maybe I just got a bad batch.My rating is very poor! George K."
5,Cleans like a dream!,"I used this on my olive green micro-suede couch and cushions. After life with 2 small children, 2 dogs, 3 cats, a couple couch surfers, and a stint in a storage unit, this couch needed to be cleaned badly. The Blue Coral got all the stains out and grim. The smell that had been there before is now gone. Its got its softness back and the lid brush was a big help on the tough stains. It took one can to clean my couch. I would definitely buy this again!"
5,It does magic!,"I haven't tried any other upholstery cleaner products, but this cleaner did magic! It removed stains and dirt that have been on my car's seat quickly and effectively. Make sure to wipe off the sprayed area with a cloth or paper towel after you scrub. My seats look good as new!"
2,not for me,"I guess Course in Miracles thought is just not for me. Maybe just too Christian, with all its blame/wrongdoing thinking, I don't know. I didn't finish this. I don't like Williamson's writing. There's just a bit too much judgement going on in her approach. It's just not the highest and best spiritual philosophy I've been influenced by. But someone just coming to New Thought from a Christian background might get a lot from Williamson and the CIM point of view. Just not for someone who has explored wider and is maturing spiritually."
5,Cook Belgian frites at home & choose the right Belgian beer!,"This book offers a humorous look at the history of the Belgian frite (french fry) as well as offering traditional Belgian recipes. You will learn how to pick the right Belgian beer to accompany your food, as well as how to prepare your own Belgian frites! And if you are in Brussels, they even give you suggestions on where to find the best, and the most unique, Belgian foods! Overall a great book!"
2,Fatally Flawed,"Yes, it does provide a bit more eye relief, and can make it easier to see the whole frame (by making it smaller), BUT there is a major problem with this. The eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this, and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you. This is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses."
3,Save Your Money,"View is too small and not enough light with this eyepiece. It does extend the eyepiece to keep your smeller off the display, but you will sacrifice by having a much smaller and less accurate view in the viewfinder. It is easy to add to the XTI and take it off again. The build quality of the eyepiece is very good. It just wasn't worth the amount of loss I experienced in the viewfinder. I ended up taking it off my camera and it now occupies a cherished spot in my camera bag. Maybe someday I will add it to my camera and take it off again just so I don't feel guilty for buying it and not returning it."
3,An inexpensive canon accessory?,"I purchased the eyepiece extender for my 50D to prevent my nose and cheeks smudging onto the LCD screen due to oil. Yes, it did help, but not significantly.I guess you can't really complain considering the price of this canon accessory."
1,Extender EP-EX15 or EP-EX15 II for 50D?,"1) Which extender, the EP-EX15 or the EP-EX15 II, fits the 50D better?2) Does the original rubber frame fit on both of them?3) What is the main difference between the two?4) Does the tighter one still fall off the 50D?5) Can you remove the lenses from both of them?6) Appreciate any other advice concerning the two VF extenders and the 50D."
2,Not what I thought it did,1) it doesn't keep my face from touching the back of the camera or improve ergonomics to a noticeable degree.2) it makes the viewer image SMALLER and adds barrel distortion. It's like looking into your high-tech SLR with expensive lenses through a peep-hole.
3,Should have been standard not an option and reversed,"As I read all the reviews about this product, I realized that we AALLLL had a common problem with our Cameras and this particular product.For me it was simple, I dismantled the eyepiece , took the lenses from the inside, trimmed the metal plate on the inside ( in order to hold the plates together stiff ) and mounted it on the Camera - Canon 5D Mark II - , end of story works great this way.But such an oversized eyepiece should have been standard on such Cameras.If you want to do the mod like I did, don't forget to trim the metal plate and mount it back as it were on the inside , otherwise your eyepiece will be loose and it will fall, so keep the plate and it will be stiff in it's place."
4,nose print preventer,"If you want to keep nose prints off your ""preview"" screen, then this is the ticket.works great. Stays on camera fairly well.would buy again."
4,Canon EP-EX15 Eyepiece Extender for 50D,"To clarify since I searched the web all over and found no clear answer, this eyepiece is the perfect fit for the 50D. Super snug, perfect snap. The II version may fit as well, but I'm just confirming this one definitely does. It extends the eyepiece a slight amount, and it's just enough to keep your nose and face off the screen. In my opinion, it also looks better on the camera.I am rating 4/5 based on the slightly smaller viewfinder image. Yeah, it's a little smaller, but nothing major. It's not as bad as some people are making it out to be. If you have good eyesight you'll be fine. I did read somewhere it is possible to manually remove the less magnification from the extender, but I'm fine with it for now.Overall I am happy with the purchase! 4/5"
1,no use.. resting in my backpack,"The product is nice, but useless.. it's resting in my backpack since I bought it. It makes the viewvinder so smaller you cant check focus and other caracteristics of the image."
4,eyepiece extender,"Excellant accessory. Keeps smears from LCD. In the climate I shoot in, this is important."
2,Not a tight fit,"The extender works well for extending...and allows me to get close without smashing my big nose. The issue I have with this extender is that it doesn't come with a pad for the eye, so you use the one that came with the camera. As a result the tolerances aren't correct and the pad continuely falls off the extender...I've considered gluing it to resolve the issue. This could be solved by including a pad with the extender or by making the attachment to the pad more than a pressure fit."
4,Just what EYE was looking for!,Fits snuggly. Helps getting your face off of the camera and reduces tilted shots because of a tilted face trying to squeeze into the viewfinder. I deducted 1 star because the internal optical magnifier inside is problematic. As soon as I did what others suggested to do about removing the piece I was happy with my purchase. I purchased this with theHoodman H-EYEC18L HoodEYE for 5D and 5D Mark II DSLR Camerasand together they have improved my framing. Well worth the money for both.
2,Smaller Viewing Area,Got this in Hong Kong when purchasing a lot of little add-ons for my Canon 5D Mark II. It cuts down the viewing area through the viewfinder so I don't like it at all. I have a protective cover for the live view so not worried about smudges. Interesting - I noticed I wasn't enjoying taking photos as much anymore. Then remembered I had that eyepiece on there. Really affected the view area.
2,Crops field of view in viewfinder,"PROS: Distances your nose from the LCD, reducing ""smudges""CONS: Biggest issue is that it crops the field of view in the viewfiner. It's almost a guessing game with how much more the picture will include than what you see when taking the shot. Also decreases the size of the image, making it difficult if you don't have strong eyes (like myself)."
2,"J Hodges West Point, Utah","Yes it does extend your eyepiece out, but at what price? It's like looking through a pair of binoculars backward. Your view finder is about half the size."
2,I CAN'T SEE!!,"Oh my god, it doesn't prevent my nose going against the LCD screen at all, it extended about 2mm, that's pretty much it, I am asian and my nose is not even as close to Jacky Chen! on top of that, the viewfinder is about 30% smaller! it's so hard to focus at low light, cause all your objects are SO FREAKING SMALL NOW!"
5,Works well,I bought this eyepiece because I was tired of my face smashed against my LCD display on my 20D and the resulting smudges.The extender moves my face away just the right amount - no smudges but also not so far out that it is obstructive.
5,Have glasses and can't see the entire viewfinder screen?,"I wear glasses and my prescription is too strong to correct with the standard diopter adjustment. I have to press my eyeglasses against the eyepiece warping them in the process. On top of that, my eye still sits too far from the viewfinder screen to see it all at once. Sometimes this means that I miss important information like a shutter speed set too slow to avoid blurring or the fact that my flash unit isn't quit ready yet for the next shot. Or I miss seeing a portion of the scene that I would have liked to completely include or exclude from the shot. The Canon EP-EX15 Eyepiece Extender solves this by showing me the entire viewfinder screen all at once. And I no longer have to keep adjusting my viewing angle or smashing my nose to do it. Ah, that's much better."
4,works for me,"This little item does what it's suppose to do with a some cons depending on how you look at hit. It will extend your eyepiece by about 5mm from the original position which will help reduce those oil smear from the lcd screen. This will help you find a better position to take your shot since it you won't have to push your face in contact with the camera body to actually see your subject.The extender will reduce the size of your viewfinder by about 20-30% which can be a pro or a con depending on how you look at it. Pro if you want to see the whole view faster since you'll see the image on the viewfinder at a reduced size, meaning that you can evaluate the shot faster. Con if you need to see a magnified image on the view finder to see the detail before taking a shot. (not really a con for me, that's what the LCD is for :P)Better comfort overall."
4,Good but ...,"Perfect match to the camera, but the eye cup keeps falling off. I have a difficult time keeping it locked on, especially when taking in and out of the bag on the fly.Other than that, it is perfect."
1,Not Compatible with the Rebel XS,This eyepiece extender does not fit on the Rebel XS camera as advertised. It is too wide for the coupling.
1,doesn't fit right?,This gets 1 star for the simple fact that it doesn't seem to fit my Mark II body properly.
5,a pleased coustomer,"I love this item I wish that they made a longer one, my nose still touches the back screen. My item came in the time stated and as ordered. Jerry"
3,Good if you don't have a screen protector...,I ordered the eyepiece extender because you really do need one so your face or nose doen't mar up the screen. The only thing is that I also ordered a delkin screen protector and you can not use the extender with the protector. Since it's more important to me to protect the screen I use the delkin.
2,Makes image too small,The product is of good quality but it makes the image so small that it is hard to see what is in your viewfinder.
1,What's for???,"At least this accessory do not help to a better sight, the motives appears so far from the camera. Pay attention, this model do not fix well for Rebel T1i as announced."
2,Not worth it,"I've lost two eye cups using this thing, so having to replace those I'm spending money unnecessarily. It currently does not sit on my camera and instead in a drawer where I will never find it again. It also makes the viewfinder ridiculously small. Not worth it, even free."
3,The Decameron (Oxford World's Classics),"This is an easy to read book and, undoubtedly, has been well translated. I read the Canterbury Tales from the same series and enjoyed it more. These tales, like those in the Canterbury tales, are earthy and funny. But they tend to be variations on the same theme(marital infidelity) and, after the first 50 tales, you get tired."
4,THE GROUP SHOW,"This is a main stream performance. Both sound and picture in this blu ray disc are very good. The group dancing is very enjoyable creating wonderful shapes. Regarding individual performances, there are better productions. Letitsu herself although a very skillful dancer, casts a very sad and unenjoyable mood. This production is the complete oposite of the Zurich production with Semionova where the production is not the standard one, the dances are different, the group dance are less enjoyable but the individual dances (and not only semionova) are much more interesting."
2,Smaller than described,"I received the salt and pepper shakers and was disappointed that they were not as large as described in Product Details. They actually measure 2 3/4 inches tall; 2 inches wide at the top; 1 3/4 inches wide at the bottom. Good enough quality, but I sort of feel like I have been duped by false advertising. I haven't decided whether it is worth the hassle to return them or not."
5,Good and soft!,"I like it, it is easy to handle. Also, there is a choice of very light weight, which is sometimes, hard to find.I am totally satisfied."
2,Not a great product,"I was dissapointed that it broke 2 days after receiving it. I tried to contact seller, but to no avail."
1,Horrible,Worthless. It rips off your battery door when you try to take the phone off. Flimsy and broke within a week. Not even worth the 0.01 I paid for it which is sad. :(
5,Beautiful Set,"This is a very pretty set. Neutral colors, but with a trim of navy blue and green. Very detailed. Sturdy. Nice large rims around the plates and bowl. We leave our dining room table always set with these. It looks beautiful."
5,"Melodic, Moving et Mémorable","With such soulful and melodious lyrics, Ridan's spicy, yet soothing voice has definitely captured me as an avid listener.I look forward to hearing more from this fabulous chanteur!"
4,pleased,It took a bit of time for the order to get processed but once it did I recived them quickly. I would buy them again for my son.
5,Should have just a little VB in there,"Dan Wahlin is one of the top experts on XML, and this book is absolutely fantastic. Almost every question that I have ever had about working with XML and .NET has been answered... except that I don't use C#. So, I always need a translator.If you use C#, this is the perfect book. If you don't, learn to translate from it, cuz this is the best book around."
4,Pretty good book,"This book does a good job explaining the ins and outs of XML programming with the .Net Framework.These are the types of books you need to look for. Take a small part of the .Net framework and give it a decent amount of coverage. Overall, the examples are fairly substantial and apply very well to real world programming situations."
5,Good one for ASP.NET developers,"This book not only gave the introduction for XML, but also expalins the XML namespaces and ADO.NET and XML transformations etc.. Nicely written and very good book."
5,XML for ASP.NET!!,"The content of this book is really good.The author explained the topic really well. The examples are not a boring scenario.If you're a serious .NET developer, you will keep this bookas your reference."
2,Not easily explained comparing with Microsoft XML's docs,"On the book's description, I couldn't find any information explaining that this book is for beginner or advanced level. As I'm a beginner to XML and I have an advanced level in ASP.NET, the book was ok until page 131. From page 134 to the end, the content is not easily explained comparing with Microsoft XML documentations for .NET framework and SQL server 2000."
3,dont get this version,"It is nice to have this huge book in the portable kindle format but since there aren't annotations you will miss a lot unless you can translate French and have a good understanding of Russian politics and culture. Arnna is not as large apart of the story as you would expect and she often disappears for extended periods while other characters hunt, discuss politics, harvest, and reflect on grass and mushrooms."
2,Not as advertised,"Expected razor to glide over face, but ended up cutting myself. It works much better if you use a lot of oil, but then it's not cost effective. Vegetable oil might have just as much lubricity."
1,Misleading information,"Even though you are asked to pick the color and weight of the exercise band when you order this item, the band is not included. You only receive the guide. The description is also misleading as the description is for the band itself not for the guide. I felt cheated when it arrived."
3,Pretty helpful but not enough,"I just started using the Xering teaching my Jazzercise Personal Touch class (we also use XerTubes, fee weights and the Swiss ball). The booklet shows helpful stretching, and primarily leg exercises. I expected more options using the ring. We have some exercises using it for abdominal, core and arm strengthening, and none of these were in the book."
2,More drunken anthology than Live Footage,"I hoped to maybe get a live concert like off of Live 101 Proof but there's mostly drunken, behiind-the-stage antics going on. Its fun, play along, match Dimebag shot for shot, but it gets a little old. There's a good live Cowboys from the '91 Moscow Festival, but no Live TrendKill. The cool videos off of Far Beyond are within all the meyhem and not in the menu. Probably a True-Fans-only DVD but I know I'll keep mine."
5,"Just shut up and watch, if you're a true fan that is........","RIP DIME!!! This is a great DVD for any fan of this colossal band. Being a local resident to the Funky Town/Arlington area where these guys (with the exception of Phil) are from, I have had the privilege of seeing these guys perform in basements all the way up to packed stadiums. Yeah- and for all you little whining half nerd panty wastes, the DVD could use some added functionality but does it even need it!!?? If you are a fan you will find a lot here that far exceeds what you can do with the disc (Give me a break and leave this one for the O.G.'s)!!!!!!!!RIP DIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Old Release, Minimal Features","Well, my friend has had this one since the initial 1999 release. Back then it was common practice to put out DVDs of poor construction and little or no perks. This one definately falls into that category. As others have reviewed before, it is basically 3 VHS vids thrown on a DVD with no chapter points. Of course I love the material involved, but even 5 years ago the lack of chapters was a huge letdown.Fortunately these days I can re-author the thing myself, adding chapters to skip to and fixing that hissy sound (almost sounds like the older stuff was a straight VHS to DVD transfer). So my final result is much better than this original. Not slamming Pantera, mind you, but I would have a hard time paying $35 for a used copy of this."
5,Necessity for Pantera fan,"My hubby was very happy with the videos! If your a fan, you must get these! It was bundled so you get all 3 videos. The quality was good."
4,Hallelujah!!!,"One of the coolest Xmas gifts ever. Pantera has always been my favorite metal band since first hearing them late Eighties back in high school. Saw them on the Cowboys tour with Exodus + Suicidal and every tour thereafter. Anytime they came through my town it was on. Never experienced such power before. Phil was a God, Rex held it down, and what can you say about Vinnie and Dime that hasn't been said already. This vid package provides a fantastic representation of what I experienced first hand as a long time fan. Everything the hardcore could want. Great footage onstage, backstage. Raise a glass to Dime. A must have for all down with Pantera."
3,Good Music. Very poor DVD design,"I'm a big fan of Pantera so I find the music on this DVD to be great. I don't care much for all the behind the scenes stuff on the disk (which is probably 70% of the content) but I can get past that.The biggest problem with this DVD is the design. What they did was take the three Pantera VHS tapes and put each on a seperate track on the DVD. That's it, 3 tracks. Which means you cannot just jump to your favorite song or section of the DVD because it's not divided. The best thing you could do is find the time elapsed for your favorite section and write that down on the DVD case and then jump to that time.Why use DVD and not use the features of DVD?UPDATE: Evidently there's a new version where they've fixed the chapter problems. I wonder if Amazon would accept a return 11 years later? :)"
5,Worth buying even if you have it already,"Because you can skip through chapters. Don't anticipate 500 chapters though, each video has about 6-8 chapters which basically split up the music videos from the shenannigans. If you haven't seen this video yet, it gives you a very different view of Pantera. They're just a fun group of guys that partied hard. A great thing to watch while you drink before you go out."
5,Great video on it's own.,"I can definately see why some people gave this dvd a low rating. If you've got any of the original pantera videos it's a waste of money.However, I must admit that I enjoyed this an aweful lot. The live performances were awesome. My favorite is definately ""domination"" on the monsters of rock festival in moscow. It's so damn energetic, just makes me want to jump up and break stuff. ^_^. In addition, I really love all of the backstage stuff. These guys are hilarious and the clip with Yngwie Malmsteen in the first video is too funny... ""I don't want no donuts!"" ooooh man, I still get a good kick out of that.Anyway, to sum it up, this dvd is worth it as long as you don't have any of the other pantera videos. I don't mind not being able to skip to scenes, it does bring back the older days of metal where you would always watch the bands tour videos on VHS. These guys have some balls and I'd say deserve some respect for being so nuts and wonderful."
3,I agree with the last reviewer,"I already owned all of these on video, but i bought this version because i thought that i could get the conveniences of dvd. unfortunately, with each video getting 1 track, it is no more convenient than vhs. i do not understand why it would be put together like this. but that being said, these videos are amazing. the behind the scenes stuff is hilarious. the videos are great. the live stuff is great. still a must purchase for all pantera fans."
3,Cute!,"This is a cute little book great for kids when you want to give them something to do. It is great because of the easily colored pictures, that can later be attached to a window for easy display, and let the sunlight shine through it to create a great decoration for any kids (or big kids) room."
3,Neat but really small,"When I bought this I thought it was the size of a regular coloring book. It was TINY! Probably the size of a 3x5 notecard. The pages were great and my daughter loved it, but I didn't think it was worth the price for what it actually was."
2,VERY LITTLE unicorns stained glass coloring book,"I was quite disappointed in the LITTLE size of the book it only measures4-3/8 x 5-1/2. The wording in the auction made me think that the book would be coloring book size with unicorns, with coloring book style pictures, out lined pictures with no fine detail. I thought it would be good for STAINED GLASS. The pictures are so small, 3-3/8 X 4-7/8, that they will all have to be enlarged to be able to be used for stained glass, even for sun catchers.I would think a ruler or a coin in the photo or some other size reference would have yielded 5 stars. I left a 2 star rating because the books are new and have clear coloring book style pictures. I think for the size of the book, the auction is over priced. No where in the auction does it mention the tiny size of the book."
3,"great product,but it can be defective","Tried 2 buckets of this product to remove 50 years of paint and primer. I liberally applied it, took sheets of painters plastic and stuck directly onto the Ready Strip paste. About 1 1/2 days later, I pulled the plastic off and the old paint literally fell off - I was amazed. I went back and bought 2 more buckets. Nothing happened. I had lost the receipts so I wrote to Back to Nature complaining about lack of quality control. Back to Nature's response was that this is a biodegradeable product and after about a year it degrades. They said to shake the bucket at the store before purchase and if the past moves, it is defective. Question: Why is there not a warning on the bucket or why are they not telling the distributing stores this info? There was no offer to reimburse for the product. I am now tryng Peel Away; bought it today and hope to see what happens tomorrow."
5,Just as good as the infomercial promised.,This product did everything it said it would and was well worth the price.
4,Paint Remover,The product does work as advertised. It did remove several layers of aging paint. I believe that the fact that we have a home over fifty years in age may have had an effect on the products performance. All in all I found that it met our needs much better than others that we had tried. I would recommend it to a friend.
5,Great Shelf System,"This shelving sytem worked very well for my application. I created a lumber storage system in my shop. I used the 36 inch standards with 3 brackets per standard. It's important to secure the standards into the studs in the wall. If this is done properly, this is a very secure system. I am storing lumber as large as 10 foot 4 X 4s. I estimate the total load on the shelves to be about 150 pounds. I highly recomend this system."
4,Great clip lamp,"Good design, perfect size, nice product and clip is very strong, Great for inside closet, and bedside reading.I own 2 of these already. The ivory is a nice color."
4,"This lamp is so awesome. When you turn the knob, a light comes on.","It doesn't get much better than this. This wonder of science features an amazing switch that, when twisted, causes this magical device to emanate beautiful heavenly light that increases all saving throws vs. shadow creatures by +2. Highly recommended when facing Nosferatu or otherworldly creatures.Also serves as a useful reading lamp on a bedpost."
5,Better than the manual,Ben's done it again! His book is loaded with tips and tricks that you'll never find in a yellowbook.
3,Outdated Information,The only reason to purchase this book would be to use as a paper weight. Most of the information is R4\R5 related. If you haven't upgraded to R6x you should not be using domino.
3,I'm the writer of this film.,"First of all I must admit I am surprised that this DVD has not been reviewed by one single person. Our film came out on Maverick Video back in Feburary and has been a consistant best seller and rental since then. Com'on people, support our little independent film. As for my review, I won't be biased, but for what it is this movie is surprisingly effective. The director, John, acheived quite an impressive look for the film on a very, low budget. The acting is natural and the plot has a good pace which gives time for character development. Since ""The Neighborhood"" , John and myself are working on a new feature. I can't divulge anything about it until it comes out. But, if you liked the Neighborhood, you will like this film too."
3,No Information on Projects!,"This book is pretty good overall but it left out any useful information on Oracle Project Accounting. All the other financial modules (GL, AR, AP, etc.) had entire chapters dedicated to them but NOTHING FOR PROJECTS. This ommission is a huge disappointment given the fact that PA is so complex and not widely known in the consulting field like the other modules."
2,Oh oh! No published date information available,"I recently ordered this special edition used book and it arrived within 1 week and in good condition. I am very happy with the prompt service. However, I was dissapointed that the book was of year 2000 publication. As the book I bought was linked to the main latest edition book on this site and with no information to the contrary, I was expecting the latest edition book. It is suggested that it should be mandatory for every book appearing on this site, specially the IT books and software to carry the edition and published year information. We must be allowed to make informed decision.In the virtual world of internet we cannot examine for ourselevs and have to depend on whatever information is provided. And sometimes we have to learn the hard way. I will never again buy a used IT book unless it states its details clearly."
3,Lo Behold ! At Last,Implementation of Oracle Applications is one of the most challenging and interesting Job today and a handbook to guide you through this is of paramount importance. Good that at last it is goning to come out after a long wait.
3,Original and uncut. 2 movie deal.,This is the original night of the living dead and uncut and in black and white same with carnival of souls. I rate carnival of souls a 1 star. Night of the living dead will always be a 5 star film to me since george romero set the standard for all zombie films.
3,Inconsistent,"This book seems like it was written by a team of strangers- the advice, style, and point of view vary throughout. Pregnant women were advised to avoid alfalfa sprouts completely because of toxins in pesticides, then they appeared (raw) as the main ingredient in a sandwich. Orange roughy was listed as a fish to be avoided due to mercury levels, then it appeared on a list of fish recommended for pregnant women.The first section is noticibly stronger than the second, and it certainly contains a great deal of useful information. I will probably refer to some sections again, particularly the many charts giving nutrition information for specific foods."
5,Informative and helpful.,This book is great. It helps you modify your eating with terrific recipes and even good choices at a variety of fast food chains. She even suggests menus for when you don't feel like cooking or eating.
2,Not up-to-date,"Although accessible and easy to read, this book is unfortunately woefully behind on nutritional research. Recommendations such as to avoid fats are misguided and out of date. We need healthy fats, such as found in eggs, seeds such as flax and hemp and animal foods. Women who are pregnant have particularly high needs for the omega-3 essential fatty acids. Swinney's recommendations fall short in protein; getting adequate protein is one of the single most important and effective things a mother can do to avoid pre-eclampsia. It is unfortunate that Swinney's book is not up-to-date because it is clearly written and accessible. We would all benefit from a revision to the book that is based on the latest research."
1,Waste of time and money,"This book seems designed to cash-in on a group of people, mostly women, who are desparate to do anything they can to either get pregnant or have teh healthiest possible pregnancy. This might be ok if the book was well written, had a novel perspective, or great recipes. It has none of these. It is repetitive, self-contradictory, and tells you nothing that you could not glean from the internet in less than 30 minutes. Don't waste your money."
2,Okay for Kids but not Challenging,"Although this game was a little enjoyable for my children, 6 & 8, it was painfully slow for both me and my husband. The cards needed to be shuffled and reused 4 times before the game ended. More and different cards would have kept it interesting and more educational. For children who do not know the story of Exodus well, this might be educational, but, for children who attend day school, this is redundant and repetitious. There is nothing challenging about this game. I'm sure they will play again, but this will not stay in our Passover collection very long.Just a side note to the manufacturer, on the front of the box, the suggested age says, 4-8 and on the back if says 5-10."
1,One of the worst movies ever!,"I was expecting more than a one-star piece of ""HUH?"" but that's what this movie gives you. It seems to be interesting but then peters out to ""Huh? What happened? Did it just end?"" A very big disappointment. Nothing to do with Bradbury, who I love."
3,Padding!,"First consider that they had to pad the script by about sixty pages! It's a great and classic story by Ray, and the filmmakers did a good job adapting it to the screen."
2,Misleading Title & Poorly Written,"I did not particularly care for this book for three reasons. First, most of the locations listed certainly do not fall into the ""World's Most Haunted Places"" category. Second, the locations are well-known to those with an interest in true ghost stories--in other words, nothing new. And third, the author makes numerous grammatical errors and his writing style/ability is about that of a high school student. Mr. Belanger just doesn't have what it takes to tell a good ghost story."
3,Something's Missing,"I enjoyed this book. However, a more apt title would have been ""Some of the World's Favorite Haunts,"" for it is by no means inclusive. I won't contest the author's belief that the sites he lists are indeed very haunted, but why does he believe these particular sites are more haunted than others? He doesn't give a criteria for why this is so, and I think it would have benefited him greatly if he had done so. Nonetheless, a worthy read, with photos and web sites, and for the most part well-written. Just keep in mind there are other places out there which are just as, if not more, haunted than many of the sites he lists in this book."
5,This book is truly amazing.,"This book is really great. Jeff is an amazing writer.If you ever get the chance to meet him, he is truly a nice and sweet guy, if he has candy he always love to share!Thanks for signing my book at the April Mansfield event Jeff!"
3,"Um, Not too bad.","Entertaining, definitely leaves out some majorly famous haunted locations and includes some very non-famous ones. Firsthand accounts are pretty interesting, written for about a seventh-grade reading level. Purported ghost pictures in the book are terrible and shouldn't have been included--just make the whole topic look more deperate for recognition."
2,paranormal snoozefest!,"what an awful book! poorly written, stories tell too much unnecessary back story, not enough actual ghost encounters, too much ""interviewing"" with people who haven't even experienced the ghosts first hand, and the author uses first person writing style throughout the book! not to mention the numerous mis-spellings like ""lode"" (should be ""load"") and so forth. I bought this book at a bookstore for an airplane flight to keep me occupied and I ended up falling asleep...on both flights! don't waste your money."
4,Well written overview of Oracle 7,"A great overview of database concepts and how they apply to Oracle. Well written, in plain, easy to understand language."
2,"Good ideas, bad presentation","I was required to purchase and use this book for an Oracle database design class.Although the authors are experienced DBAs and have good ideas on database design and implementation, they convey their ideas rather poorly. They don't deal with topics one at a time and jump from one idea to the next at times within one paragraph. This book has good ideas, but one has to read this book several times and also must be an intermediate to an advanced level Oracle developer to get the most out of it."
1,The reaction watch,"It would of been great but time zone gave me the wrong watch and when i wrote them they did not respond, they sent me a New York watch which is a cheaper watch and the knob fell of 6 days after i got it, do yourself a favor and don't do business with this company it seems like they don't care about the customer and just trying to make a quick buck.... You have been warned... Time Zone is no good..."
3,Pretty good toy.,"We got this toy for my pitbull puppy when he was just 2 months old. he loves it. he has since grown to be 8 months old, 50 lbs, and is a bit rougher on toys now. Besides him ripping the arms off this thing he still has it and loves it. Would probably last longer with a smaller or gentler chewer."
4,Good Book if you like potential series.,"His book was wonderful and a delight to read. For one Amazon book recommender was right on with my tastes. I wasn't sure about this book in the begining because it didn't explain anything about why Kari was so driven to please her father at any cost. Once I figured things out it was a very enjoyable read. The books one major flaw was that it didn't come to an ending. It just kind of leaves you hanging about what happens to all but the main two characters and even that is kind of hanging. You know they get married (come one I didn't really spoil anything did I?), but beyond that what happens to them? It just smells a little like a sequal and me spending more money."
3,Poor Quality Control,"I read other reviews and decided to gamble. Received lamp, switch was defectivelucky for me it was broken in the on position didn't have to remove switch,thought about sending it back,but would have cost 68% of what I paid for it. No guarantee new one would be serviceable. For $3.50 I installed a inline switch,measured from the headboard to a handy position,and IMHO actually improved the function. Light works great,another review say no side adjustment, 20% tilt,mine rotates left and right & tilts 20%. He was right about the tilt. He must have got a damaged one too. Look at all the reviews, fairly high % of problems with this lamp.I don't think LAMPS PLUS makes these, Just sells them. A little better quality control & this would be a nice little reading Lamp.I think I will just stick with products only sold by amazon and is qualified for Prime. Purchased from Amazon seller, Lamps Plus"
3,its okay,i thought it was wireless but it wasnt which is why i gave it 3 stars. other than that the clip serves its purpose perfectly.
2,could have been better,"It seemed like a nice item when first looked at - it is sturdy and clip worked well. Plugged it in - put a bulb in it and hey great - works fine. Next day - went to turn it on - no good. Spent 10 minutes verifying it's not the plug/outlet/bulb. Basically - I have to try it about 10 times before it decides to either turn on or off. Obviously the switch has issues. Doesn't make me feel like it's safe. Also, 60 watt bulb over my head in this - felt like I was being sweated at police station - OK - I'll talk!!! Without a shade - it's kinda brutal just glaring right above you. Will switch to a 40 watt and try using the plug to turn it on/off - but it certainly isn't very convenient now. Shame, it looked like it could really be a good thing. Looks sturdy - but the quality is not there."
3,"Okay, But Barely Adjustable","It's a decent & simple little lamp. Uses standard bulb. But... it is barely adjustable. It has like 1"" range of motion up & down. Okay for the price."
5,BARC Better Than Bite!,"I could shave with a buck-knife, slap on some lotion then be good to go. Something happened in January 2009. I noticed electric razors gave me ingrown whiskers plus not a clean shave. I switched to the Gillette Fusion. Ultra-smooth shave but my face exploded with ingrown whiskers. I mean, bad. Like, losing self-confidence bad!Tried a woman's razor with moisture beads but that didn't work either. Spent over $300 on products which claimed to to prevent or stop ingrown whiskers. Most barely worked or worse, burned the skin. I was at a loss about what to do. It was awful.I went to a disposal which helped but gave a lousy shave. I still picked up ingrown whiskers but they were smaller. Finally, I read in Grooming Lounge about BARC. Went to Amazon, found it then read the reviews: Eric M. is right on the money! The Mach 3 razor plus BARC gave me no ingrown whiskers for the first time in six months! This product is amazing. BARC works! No, I don't work the company"
3,It's just ok,"I'm a Black woman who tweezes some chin hairs. I get the occasional, annoying hair bump. This product helped a little. Didn't do enough for me to purchase more after I finished this bottle."
2,Works better for razor bumps than razor burn?,"I think there is a difference between razor bumps and razor burn, and I think I had the latter. Excessive shaving was causing dark red, itchy patches on my face that took days of not shaving to fade and heal. I tried using Barc, and while it burnt like heck (indicating to me that it might be doing something productive), it never did anything to heal these red patches. In the end I gave up and started using a cortisone cream. Maybe it was just a coincidence, but after switching to the cortisone the red patches went away completely and permanently. Maybe I was not using Barc for its intended purpose, and if that's the case then please disregard my low rating."
1,Doesn't work well at all.,I read about this in Vibe and bought it. It did not fix the proublem. I was hoping that it would work but it really didnt do anything from what I can tell. My girlfriend didnt think that it did anything either.
2,dbeau@flash.net Very Misleading Title,I purchased this video because of the title Sinatra The Man and His Music with The Count Basic Orchestra. This DVD has only 2 songs with Count Basie. I thought the complete video was with the Count Basie Orchestra. Instead it has cuts with other string orchestras. I was very disappointed in this video. I would not purchase it if you want to hear the music of Count Basie and Frank Sinatra. Instead buy the CD's.
3,He found a second wind,"....Sinatra's voice is greatly improved from 1974's Main Event.""I Get a Kick Out of You"" with quartet is one of his best--not to be missed.About the songs with the Basie band--check out the drummer. That's Gregg Field, who became Frank's permanent drummer in 1990 after the passing of Irv Cottler.It was a good time in the singer's professional life, a year after the top-selling TRILOGY and right after the issuance of SHE SHOT ME DOWN, a strong saloon song effort.Definitely worth acquring for song content, orchestrations and Sinatra's vocal renaissnace."
3,He found a second wind,"First off, the year posted here (is wrong), it was 1981.Sinatra's voice is greatly improved from 1974's Main Event.""I Get a Kick Out of You"" with quartet is one of his best--not to be missed.About the songs with the Basie band--check out the drummer. That's Gregg Field, who became Frank's permanent drummer in 1990 after the passing of Irv Cottler.It was a good time in the singer's professional life, a year after the top-selling TRILOGY and right after the issuance of SHE SHOT ME DOWN, a strong saloon song effort.Definitely worth acquring for song content, orchestrations and Sinatra's vocal renaissnace."
5,The best album in their catalog,"I think this is the best album in their catalog. I had the original version on Vinyl and the 87 remake on CD. This Deluxe Edition gives you both versions, remastered. Now that I have this, I can finally get rid of my 87 remake version. I'll keep the original on Vinyl, for nostalgic purposes."
4,great BUT....,"OK, it's a masterpiece of prog aural bliss. BUT one thing I cannot forgive. The Prelude on the suite ""Fall of House of Usher"" is literally from an unfinished piece by Claude Debussy, ""La chute de maison Usher"". The fact that this is not acknowledged in the album information (or is it on the Deluxe edition?) is something of a scandal, I believe. Do messrs Parsons/Woolfsons/Powell want us to suppose they could ever write such music on their own? Opinions on this please!"
5,ABSOLUTELY SUPERB EDITION,"This set caps the re-release of the first four AP-supervised remastered titles (three more to follow in September '07, and the final three in December).For this edition, for the first time on CD, we finally get the original 1976 mix of the album that started it all. While I definitely prefer the '87 remix, there are passages in the original I also enjoy, so it's great to finally be able to compare the two, especially in glorious, remastered form.In the additional material, there are two excellent spoken-word pieces: One, Orson Welles' entire original recitation, sans music/effects, and also a very enjoyable 8+ minute 1976 radio interview with AP and EW.The booklet is a wonderful, detailed labor of love, with a great essay.If you're an APP fan, this is an absolute must-own."
1,"Terrible image quality, poor sex, No interest at all","Very disapointing pseudo DVD .It is likely that we have here a MPEG1 ( CDRom like) edition of a vey unattractive movie. the scenario is poor, the actors below average, the direction nil.Technically, no chapterisation, sound below average, the image quality terrible.In less than two words: MISERABLE.Stay away from that."
1,"flawed and dull story, poor acting, bad editing, misleading title","Wow, really bad. Storyline contains numerous flaws and holes which destroy maintaining any interest on that level. There's a naked scene at the beginning which is about all you get, and the action scenes are pathetic. Skip this one."
5,Beautiful Cd,I love this Cd. When I'm at my lowest point and I need something to remind me of how good God is and how his mercy is forever..I just listen to Smokie and it just makes me feel so much better. I love the whole Cd but one song that really touches my heart is #2 Still say Thank you...beautiful...and #7 is one of my favorites also..I need you know..if your looking for something that helps you pick yourself up when your down..look no further...I love this Cd..I love Smokie Norful..may god continue to bless you to bless us with more great music..
3,Outlined the experience but no depth,"In my journey to explore the Harlem Renaissance, I started with this book. I felt the author gave a good basic view of the era but he left out the soul. He focused on six or seven primary personalities of the time, from Langston Hughes to Zora Neale Hurston, and tied the times into their existence. I was left feeling like there had to be more about the era. The author also chases around issues of major character homosexuality, stating it but not really being clear about it. I was ready for it to end."
2,Need more in-depth coverage,"... a Flash book that just don't help much, and let me explain why. The book tries to cover a lot of stuff in Flash 5, but not getting deep enough into why the scripts and structure are done for each of the project. At most you get one or two lines such as ""this line does this function, blah blah blah"" and not letting you know why the author chose this way to make the whole function work. This book is great for those Flash Developers that just like to copy and paste codes instead of really learning the actionscript, so if you are one of those ..., you're in luck. For others, try Friends of Ed books for a change, they might not be in all color but the content for all their books are worth every penny you spent on them"
5,1 Star reviewers WAY off,"I don't normally write book reviews, but when I saw all the bad reviews for this book, I had to speak up. I've gotta think that the majority of one star reviewers on this book are either from competing book authors or their friends. This book has been out and away the most valuable Flash 5 book I purchased this year. The code on the CD, alone, has paid for the book probably a dozen times for me. I did do differently than the authors intended though. Instead of starting each chapter with the unfinished or ""start"" files (I think), I just followed along with the chapters using the finished files because I usually didn't have time to do it the other way.I've checked out most of the Flash 5 books available and with the exception of parts Colin Moock's book-which is more of a technical reference book, Flash 5 Magic is the only real world application book available. I don't know what I would have done for several of my jobs this year if I didn't have Flash 5 Magic."
2,No reason to get this book,"Boy did I hate this book. I read so many reviews and everything before deciding on this one. Good thing my company paid for it otherwise I'd really be kicking myself. This book is ugly and confusing. I had a general knowledge of ActionScript and kenw the tools in Flash like the back of my hand when I started reading it, but I just couldn't make myself go through this book. They just make you do some exercise projects which are not useful at all and it all just confuses you much more because they don't seem to keep in mind that the reader may not be a programming expert. Everytime I tried to read it, I came away with my mind being totally messed up, look at this review! I can't think clearly anymore! Better get Colin Moock's ActionScript: The Definitve Guide, which is much clearer, much more prolific and way way more useful."
1,Frustrating,"As with Flash 4 Magic this book has been written by coders for coders. If your not a real actionScript, ASP database guru then don't waste your time on this book. These guys are clever but they have no idea how to teach. It's more of a ego trip for extremly experienced programmers. The only thing I learned from both these books is how little I know."
2,only good for the one interested in game design,"Most of the chapters are about how to create the cool games, but I want to know how to create the cool sites!"
2,Flash 5 Magic,Most of the chapters of this book is about how to create the games. How about I just need to create a Flash website?
4,Nearly pure Magic,"The previous version of this book took the world of Flash development by storm. It was THE book to have for the aspiring Flash designer. But, like all magic, the luster wears off after everyone knows the tricks. Flash 5 Magic is an updated version with lots of new content, but it suffers from many of the same flaws. Much of the content is hard to follow unless you are a seasoned Flash developer. Also, the code is not error free, leaving the reader to scratch their head and wonder why. The sample files in this book are better prepared than any other Flash tome (with the exception the the New Masters book) making it a worthwhile purchase. Of course, expect all the other Flash developers to be able to offer the same tricks within a month..."
4,Does what its predecessor didn't,"After finding Flash 4 Magic to be one of my more disappointing purchases of the previous year, I was hesitant to pick up this book. Fortunately, this one delivers. Flash 5 Magic not just a book on how to do basic graphics and making simple timeline based movies. This version gets in depth with Flash 5's Action Script and XML capabilities.If you already code, don't really want another graphics how-to book, and want some good ideas, this is the book for you. On the other hand, If you are a beginner at Flash, or conversely, want some real in-depth and comprehensive info (like a Wrox or O'Rielly publication), you may have to wait a little longer. Don't wait too long though; those types of publications have been few and far between in the Flash world."
2,These trainers need training.,"I am getting so frustrated at the number of books from alleged experts in a subject. Maybe they know their material, but their knowledge didn't make it to print without a significant amount of damage. Would it that be hard to have someone unfamiliar with the book try to complete the exercises before they publish it?"
5,Still Helpful as Ever...,"I would consider myself a semi-advanced Flash developer. In my department we have programmers, animators and developers working with Flash 5, each at different levels. This book has really helped us out with our projects. The different projects and ideas that this book has to offer as helped us get started with our projects. For me, the great part has been some of the more advanced ActionScript examples in this book. As most Flash developers I get stuck from time to time, usually hours before a project is due. This book has many different examples and I am able to review them and usually find answers to my problems. My animators like the book because it offers more than just ActionScript... something that is still a new concept to some of them :)I don't find all the chapters to be useful to me but most of them are quite useful. I use parts of each project in the book to help me with my projects."
2,same mistakes as flash 4 magic,"I am an intermediate Flash user (from the Design end). As such, it's hard to spot the many mistakes this book has. I had to redo some of the exercises several times and I didn't get them all to work, even using the code included in the CD. They have you typing code without telling you about how they came up with it. Anyway, this is the last one I buy from these authors!!!At least the swf libraries are ok..."
2,I don't get it from this book,Sorry this book has a extremely confused writing style. I don't trust the 5 star reviews at all. This book must be for the way advanced but I'm not a newbie and still have a lot of trouble with it.
2,Too tough for newbies!,"This book seems to be filled with some quite clever idea's, but is too complex for us newbies. I suggest you start out with something simplier. This book is a little more targeted towards game developers for AS, and I gave it 2 starts since it does talk about creating games. Definatly needs a little more explaination about the script that your writing..."
1,THE worst Flash book I have purchased,"This was one severely disappointing Flash book. I've worked a few chapters so far (the calendar and the shopping site chapters), and have found extensive errors in the code. The example code has so many errors that I'm keeping a list of what I've had to correct. If/when I finish all of the examples, I am going to email it to the publisher.My guess is that Friends of Ed has been putting out Flash books left and right, and New Rider felt some pressure to get out Flash 5 Magic before it had been fully edited for code errors and clarity of meaning.The back of the book describes all the *cool* things it encompasses, but don't get your hopes up. This book fails to go into the much needed detail to make the examples come to life in your head. There's no explanations given as to why they structured their code as they did, and I am always left in the dark...Not worth your money... get Colin Moock's ActionScript book instead..."
3,Mixed review,"Going through enough examples in the book, I found it inviting...though I still say that they need to make the context more professional. Otherwise a good learning material."
3,Chilly Takes Over Broadway,"'Take Me To Broadway' is the first single for Gonzales' new album 'Presidential Suite'. 'Take Me To Broadway' is a three track release full of Gonzales' noted bravado, and the funky beats he has become known for. The title track is a dark hip hop song, being able to combine gangster rap attitude with a sense of humour that makes Gonzales so endearing. 'Return Of The Sugar Plum Fairy' opens with a kitschy yet danceable drum pattern, and from there progresses into borrowing the music from 'The Sugar Plum Fairy' and combining it with a series of enjoyable Groovebox devised samples and instruments. 'Concerto In E Minor' carries on from track two, with a similar use of hip-hop liberally dosed with musical-type instruments. With 'Take Me To Broadway', Gonzales has managed to create a hip-hopera vibe within the space of three tracks. The music's great, and the concept is fantastic, and is definitely worth investigation."
4,Nice reference section,"This book assumes you know a bit about programming already. They don't spend a lot of time teaching in this book with ""how to's"". You get this book for the reference section instead, which has examples of how to use the code which are much better than the ones found on MSDN's VBScript Language Reference pages."
4,Decent book for certain VBScript purposes.,"This was the book I started out with learning VBScript and ASP. It is a fairly decent quick way to get into the language. This book starts out in tutorial mode for the first 200 pages, then the next 300 pages is reference. I found it a bit hard to follow in the tutorial section. I suggest this book for people who want a quick reference, not a complete reference."
2,VBScript,"This book was written for experienced programmers transitioning from another language (or two) to VB Script. Other than the chapter listing commands, this book is mostly a waste of time and money.... if what you are looking for is learning how to program VB script in a nutshell...."
5,Best reference book out there,"Haven't had it that long, but I can look up the parameters to function calls quickly in this book. If I just had to have one VBScript book, this would be it."
2,Not Beginner Friendly,"I was looking for a VBScript book to help me get started. This is not that book. There is nothing about what software must reside on your computer, no instructions about how to get started and there are no correctly written working examples anywhere in the book. In other words, nothing a beginner needs. I guess I should have bought a ""dummies"" book..."
2,This is not the one.,"This book is completely reference oriented. If you want to learn to write VBscript using this book, you will get nowhere.I found the first error in the book within 30 minutes. To be fair, I have not yet found the second one after 10 more hours. The problem is, with 10 hours of intensive reading and searching, I am not able to figure out how to write a simple script to find a file with a known name and check its last modified date and conditionally delete it.Many say it has a good reference section. It may be true, except that a) it is not complete - I found no reference for Subfolder except the container, and b) the examples are plentiful but they are mostly one- or two-liners which show how to use a particular language element, rather than how that element can be employed to solve real life problems.$23.07 and ten hours. That's it. I am cutting my losses."
3,2nd edition didn't document all the changes in 5.6,I've been a big fan of the 1st edition for years and found it very helpful. I use Regular Expressions a lot in Perl and found VBScript's support for RE's a bit lacking (could not extract the submatches). I was pleasantly surprised to find that this capability was added in VBScript 5.5. I bought the 2nd edition of this book because it claimed to cover VBScript 5.6. Imagine my surprise when the SubMatches collection isn't documented at all.Overall I'm quite disappointed in the 2nd edition.
2,Mighty small nutshell,"I bought this book hoping to pick up the basics of writing VB script. I had previous experience writing scripts using kixtart and a little VBA, so I thought this book would help out. I found it to be poorly organized, filled with typos, and didn't even come close to describing the basics of VBScript. The author assumes the reader has at least an intermediate understanding of VB to start. Another huge omission was code samples. The book was filled with them but didn't come with a c.d. nor did the web page offer the samples for download. My learning style is hands on and without the scripts to actually test, the book was of little use for me. The one good point is that it does have a good reference section for the available functions in VB script. Definitely not a book for the pre-intermediate level VB coder."
5,A very much appreciated reference book!,"A friend of mine recommended this book for me a couple of years ago and it took me a while to find it in the book stores. After finding and reading it I was absolutely amazed! Very full of information and tips, easy to understand and written with humor as well.I have about a dozen of those Post-It flags in my book to mark the several sections that I am currently reading. The design and cross-referencing is excellent! I have yet to see a book as well-constructed as this one."
4,a great intro to text and file processing in unix...,"I continue to learn from this book. It has a really useful review of text and file processing, including a detailed description of 'find'. I like the way it is organized with lots of short sections with plenty references to other sections - sort of paper-based hyperlinking.In my opinion, many of the tools described have been replaced in everyday use by perl commands, so a new version describing the equivalent perl commands would be useful."
5,Awesome book!,"This is by far the best Unix reference book on the market. I keep coming back to it again and again. I really love it. It contains a wealth of information on just about every Unix topic you can imagine. This book is like having a Unix guru by your side at all times, and actually teaches you to become a Unix guru yourself.If you have to have only one Unix book on your bookshelf, this should be it."
2,How to be Your Own Herbal Pharmacist,I was very disappointed as this book contains no herbal formulas. There are a few formulas for cosmetics and aromatherapy but not for the herbs. It has some useful information regarding the uses of a large number of herbs but without the measurements to mix the formulas it can not be true to the title.
1,Great Sleeping Aide,"Daughters reads very slowly. The book is filled with several interesting scenarios. However, they go undeveloped. The scenarios share no common link except that they involve the same characters. There seems to be no purpose to the book; including the title. (There was only one daughter.) I was determined to finish because I wanted to know the point. There wasn't one. Like Seinfield, this book is about nothing but it's a whole lots less funny, uneventful, and boring."
2,Where's the beef ? Leaves you searching for more.,"This is a book that I would only recommend to a novice or newcomer in the Yoruba studies and culture. For a practitioner or an avid student or person with knowledge on the subject matter is leaves you saying ""Where's the beef"".It is written in a rather sophmoric manner that may only be satisfying to a very very new beginner in the Yoruba religion, or Santeria or a newly initiated person. For practitioners of Ifa, or accomplished practitioners of Santeria or Yoruba's religion, it will leave you longing for more...... much much more.I hope that this accomplished author will find it in his heart to write more with more substance in the future as I am sure that he is well capable of doing.This is a book that I would only recommend to a non-Yoruba religion practicing person who is interested in learning BASIC concepts of the religion and it's practices."
2,A fair start for the non-devotee to understand orisha.,"This book is fair and has a good summary of the Orisha. What lower its'rating by this devotee of the religion is its' misnomer by the author.He states that the Orisha ""Obatala"" is a ""white"" Orisha.Oba=king T'ala=refers to white cloth.All Orisha are African in origin."
5,Re-Packaged New Age Nonesense at the Expense of the Faithful,"Editing review - I did not intend to give five stars but ONE star. Full disclosure, when I first read this book, I thought it was great. But that was when I didn't know any better. Today, I can tell you that this is one of the most inauthentic primers of our faith out today. It claims to promote and praise ony branch of faith (Traditional Yoruba), while mocking another (Santeria), but then offers what is basically thinly veiled Santeria. His explanations and descriptions are out of the New Age cliche catalog. If you are just starting your journey to Orisa, pick up Joseph Murphy , Wande Abimbola or just about anybody else. NOT THIS BOOK. santeria.blog.com"
2,Fraud,"I reviewed this book earlier as a new initiate. As the years passed and I investigated Niemark, I have found him to be a fraud. Some of his descriptions of the Orisa, likes, dislikes are misleading and inaccurate. Also, he practices the religion like a priest/pimp. You cannot be initiated online although he does. He is like many Europeans/Caucasians who try to immerse themselves in Black/African culture in order to exploit it for their own benefit. Legitimate priests know him to be a fraud and have nothing to do with him or his institute. Don't waste your money. He is shunned by the Yoruba/Lukumi/Santeria community. Although it is well-written, this is not a reputable source of information."
1,Unfortunate,"This book does contain much information. However, it does not go into the differences or the interdependence of Ifa and Ocha."
1,Not worthy of print!,This book should be burned....was my intial reaction reading it. To this day I don't know what happen to it. Reading it made me very angry!
3,IFA Foundation,"I purchased the Book on Reccomendation from a Babalawo, I've read most of the book within a few days and found it to be ok when giving you some basic info about IFA, however I had some questions about the book and sent an E-mail to the Foundation who produced the Book and it has been almost 2 weeks since I asked a legitamate question and have not recieved an answer from anyone! I think the Book would be suited for someone who knows nothing about IFA, Santeria/lucumi and it would be nice if you could get answers from the author!"
3,Reasonable introduction,"Mr. Neimark seems to be a quite controversial figure in The Religion. Many disagree with his writing, website, and practices. He is widely considered a fraud although from what I have heard, his teachers in Nigeria are very well respected. I was recommended this book as an introductory text and I would say that it served its purpose, namely to provide a basic overview of the orishas and some historical background of The Religion. It has ignited great conversations between my teacher and I, specifically due to the need for him to clarify some things related to how his beliefs differ from those of Neimark. All in all, it is a decent read. No book can replace 1-1 direction and learning from the initiated."
5,T he Way of The ORISA is Powerful,I really enjoyed the book it gave me more depth on the truth.and the truth on the True Supreme Being OLUDUMARE of the Universe.and that each Orisa can help with our daily life.
4,The Way of the Orisa,"This was the first book I purchased on the religion three years ago. I was skeptical when I first started reading it because it was written by a European. However, after reading other books on the religion, I feel it is well-written and very well-organized. This is a compliment since I also am a writer. It provided basic information such as the mythology of, days, colors and ebos for each Orisha. It is organized so that you can go straight to the section on each Orisha and find specific information you are looking for -- i.e. favorite foods of Chango -- without reading through the entire chapter. It is a valuable addition to the library of any initiate or those who are looking for basic information on the Orishas."
1,how NOT to pinstripe,Obviously this guy thinks he's good but I wasn't impressed the sad part is that he thinks he can sing too. I had to turn the volume all the way down just to even watch it. This is a good video on how NOT to stripe cars and as for the finish paint. ... well I guess its supposed to be a rat rod because the guy has no skills. Truely sad!
5,great value,"Last year, I purchesed the Mikasa - Italian Countryside, Service for 8. They are so beautiful, and I love their quality, that I just ordered an additional - Four 5 piece place settings to allow me to have service for 12. These dishes are so versatile, that they can easily be used for either formal or casual dinners. What made this purchase even better, was the offer to buy 3 of the 5 piece place settings, and get the 4th free..AND no shipping charge !!"
4,Great Instrument,"My son calls this a flute, and rather than argue, we let it go. But his little hands have a hard time holding it. (He's 4). Even I have trouble. I'm right-handed and the right-hand keys are on the bottom. I don't know if that's how real clarinets are, but it's awkward. Also, your whole mouth has to be covering the entire mouthpiece in order to make it play, so that's also a little frustrating. But the sound is great and it's fun to play once you get the hang of it."
3,good start toy for kid!,"it is just ok, some of the plastic parts can fall part easily. but what do you expect with this price. ok for toy!"
4,child Toy,My child likes this toy but only for a couple of days then became bored with it. Maybe get something else
1,Broken piece after one week.,"My daughter was so excited to get this clarinet. She is in 1st grade and very interested in playing an instrument. After learning a few of the songs on the box she did a little recital for us and during it, one of the keys broke in half. Once one key is broken, the clarinet is useless. Granted, she was struggling a bit and perhaps applying a lot of pressure, but this clarinet is not durable AT ALL. I wasn't expecting much due to the price but I've purchased other plastic toys in this price range that lasted much much longer. I would have liked it to last more than a week. Ridiculous."
3,The only one I could find,"I was disappointed in how light, cheap feeling and easily broken this toy was. There was really no way to tell from the description"
3,Bontempi Clarinet,"This product is priced good for the quality. If you have a child that is rough with toys, this is not a good chose. My daughter is 4 years old and she really enjoys this toy."
3,Could be better made...,We got this for my daughter's 5h birthday because she asked for a Clarinet. She really loved this toy a lot and played it all the time. The problem is that the keys are very cheaply made and are continuously breaking off the body of the toy. We have lost most of the keys so now the clarinet only plays one note. Not recommended.
2,Cheap toy,"Have you ever gone to a dollar store and seen the cheap toy musical instruments they sell? They usually sell for maybe $3.99. Well, that's what you are looking at now, except they are charging $15.89. I orderered this as well as the saxaphone and trumpet for my 4-year-old son. When the package arrived last night and I opened it I was completely disgusted in how I had wasted my money. This toy is so cheaply made, even the box it was enclosed in is cheap. I am debating returning it or giving it to my son. I know because of how cheap the toy is made it'll be broke within a week."
2,Not made to withstand toddler play...,"My 4 year old LOVES music - particularly making music - however, he is definitely hard on his toys and by Day Two the keys were already falling off this thing.Was a bit pricey to be falling apart after a few days of play.Totally disappointed in the quality of musical instruments available for young learners."
2,Broken within a week,My son loves musical instruments and I had high hopes for this clarinet. Unfortunately the keys began to break off within a week after he received it for Christmas. We couldn't fix them and it's not fun to play a clarinet with no keys. It was cheap and I won't buy any of the other Bontempi instruments.
1,Not a real goddess book,"This is a Christian propaganda book, they hate the goddess and that's why there's a chapter on ""The serpent and the goddess"" serpents represent venomous liars to them. They're calling Goddess worshipers venomous liars. Also they're sticking their Adam and Eve bible propaganda in it. Most Christians believe that women should be men's slaves and secretly and actively work to take liberty away from women, they have organized efforts to oppose Goddess worship or stick male supremacist or abusive propaganda in Goddess books. Sometimes their secret brotherhoods will even rewrite books written by other authors and make sure you get their ""special"" copy. Beware and fight back. BTW, some of these brotherhoods monitor your home, bug your house, watch you without your knowledge and consent and may try to harm you. They can and do assault women who try to get away from their male supremacy pyramid scheme."
3,not too bad,"A book which is full of fancy and interesting things,yet the cover is not so perfect,looks likesome kind of software(PHOTOSHOP)......:P"
3,"Beautifully made, cool snapshots","I really liked the aesthetic of this doc made in ""Forbidden Fiji"", as the title says- everything looked great, from the people to the island to the culture to (most importantly) the waves. However, I would have liked to see less of the Irons brothers and maybe a couple more soul surfers. Fun seeing cute little Alex Gray in there though, back when he was a kid! I was way more intrigued by the movie on a surface level when I bought it, and after actually viewing, it wasn't all it cracked up to be, just overall a less interesting documentary. It was nice that Keala Kennelly got a cameo, too- I am all for any movie that reps a good female surfer!"
3,"Great little thing, but not as advertised","I'm happy I got this, but others may be surprised by two things.1. This is not five feet long. It's three feet and one inch when fully extended.2. They can offer this price because they make it up in the shipping. If you buy two, you still pay to ship two separate items."
5,Came right away but never used it :),"Nice little item, came right away, but I never did need it. Now I don't know where it is. Maybe I'll put it on eBay when I find it :)"
1,Dosen't work the way you think,This is a cheap product and does not work the way you thinkit should. please beware on this product as it is not made the way you think.
1,Poor quality,"First of all as far as Ethernet cables go, this isn't very good, i knew this going in, but the concept of it is what drew me in with it being retractable and all. I had used this an exact number of two times before the thing broke, i hadn't even moved it besides the time i plugged it in, very poor quality i would highly recommend against not purchasing this."
1,Shameful,"This album is an atrocity on the same level as Fred Durst's butchering of ""Behind Blue Eyes""."
4,That's Life,"This is the show that introduced That's Life to the world. I wrote That's Life. Perhaps of some historical interest, this show was taped before the phonograph record was made. The musical arrangement used on the show is by Nelson Riddle. This arrangment that was originally intended for use on the record but was replaced by Ernie Freeman's now classic arrangement when the record was made just a few days before this show aired. Actually, Sinatra did attempt to make the record featuring the Riddle arrangement while he was in England making a film but the attempt failed. Pre recorded tracks were shipped London and Sinatra tried to add his vocals; but, he always preferred recording with a live orchestra and was unhappy with the results of performing to tracks. The recording was ash canned...although it still may be somewhere in the Warner Bros vaults. For now, the only place to hear the arrangement originally intended for use on the recorded version of That's Life is on this video."
5,Vol 2 is not with Ella and Jobim...,"I just thought that I would write this to clarify the mistake that Amazon made in it's review of this DVD above. The DVD that they are reviewing is not Vol.2. They are reviewing A Man and His Music +ELLA +Jobim. I haven't seen Vol 2 yet, but the one with Ella and Jobim is AMAZING. I Highly recommend it!"
2,Charity begins at home!,Do not buy this one for hundreds of dollars. The rare Sinatra featuring daughter Nancy is part of the 3 tape set Sinatra-Reprise Collection volume 3-for under $10!!!!!!
4,sinatra is in great form for this the 2nd of his shows on dv,Great singing from the greatest popular vocalist this century.Featuring the marvelous orchestra of Nelson Riddle plus a wonderful musical insight to the world of sixty`s T.V.You won`t see television like this again.Truly magical.A must for all fans of good music.The dvd produces great sound and picture quality.Thank God for dvd.
3,Sinatra always worth it!,"While the one with Nancy is my least favorite of Sinatra's mid 60s television specials, it is still worth owning. There will never be another ole blue eyes, and it is always a thrill to look back at the way things were. Even when Sinatra was not at best form, he was still very very good. The best was the one with Ella and Jobim, the last one I believe."
5,Coming alive in its lines,"A decptively simple, lyrical and shifting riff on Chinese characters and caligraphy by a master poet, one whose work sometimes slipped into the pure sense of the figured line, gesture, action. Ezra Pound, as he lapsed into silence at the end of his life, began a translation of this work, as a bookend so to speak of his own response (mediated by Fenollosa) to the Chinese character. Here we have Michaux translated by American poet Gustaf Sobin, who lived many years in Southern France before passing away in 2005. The text was originally an introduction to Leon Chang's La Calligraphie Chinoise (will have to search this out and test my French) but it stands on its own as a powerful poem, and that is how it needs to be read, as a poem.The afterward by Richard Sieburth 'Signs in Action' helped me better see the connections between the act of wiriting (especially caligraphy), Michaux and his lines/signs, Pound and Fenollosa. It is a thought provoking read in its own right."
3,Good Introduction - worth reading,"If you want to get the ""feel"" of the Chinese Ideogram, this is a good introduction and by all means this is book is well worth your time and $. If you are a hard core poet and writer however I would recomend Ernest Fenollosa's ""The chinese written character as a medium for poetry"" co-written with Ezra Pound"
1,Terrible,"The 224 cases are the sharpest cases around, but definetly NOT durable! I have 5 of the 224 Wallet Scubas I bought in less then a two year period and the handles have tore from the sides, ripping the body glove material on the first three I bought over a year ago. I am so disappointed because you would think te Body Glove brand would hold up! The newer ones are starting to tear too. I use them lightly just to store the hundreds of cds and dvds I own. I don't take them out or carry them anywhere, they just still on a shelf only getting tugged on to get a movie out to watch. I'm calling Fellowes (the maker of these) as the give a ""lifetime warranty"" on them! I'll see how it goes!"
5,Excellent DVD Storage,"Once I received the Body Glove I immediately filled up one third of it with my DVDs and discovered that I had cleaned out two large shelves from my entertainment center... It not only saves space but is an attractive addition to my coffee table... It draws the interest of almost all of my guests... It is easy to use, clean and attractive... It is an excellent product."
3,Just when you think it's good...,"... you find some glaring technical errors.Part of me wonders if the technical editors were even paying attention to the details in the book. I've found a bunch of errors in the first five chapters alone. I'm not talking about grammar errors (there are plenty of those too), but errors in the code, errors in the descriptions, places in the text where it says to use the wrong codes. Basically I'm not very happy with this book so far and am now looking for another book.This book is generally well-written, and there may be good information contained in it. The problem is that there are enough obvious errors to make me wonder about the rest of it."
1,Shadow dropped the ball again! R rated version.,"Just want to make sure other people are aware that the recent DVD release (Mar 11, 2004) of this movie from Shadow is the 80 minute R rated version. Not the 90 minute unrated version."
2,Anyone who buys this will be very dissapointed,"While I liked frmalien 1 & 2, this movie was a big let down for me. The movie seems to be more on permoting the women as actors than what I got it for; unbridaled sex."
1,Shandra : The Jungle Girl,"Sick & Stupid Movie,Some Topless Girls,When Watching Make Sure The Fast Forward Button Is Working"
2,not my favorite,Glad I got this book used as I would have been mad at myself if I had paid full price. Book is okay but wasn't what I was looking for and was rather disappointed. Sorry
3,Sunpro Air/fuel Ratio Guage,"If you want to know that your stock o2 sensor is generating the rich to lean voltages nescessary for the cars computer-fuel control, this gauge will display the rapidly changing fuel states with rapidly blinking indicator lights, which can drive the eyeballs batty during night driving.The lights will not give a precise air/fuel mixture; but if they are swinging back and forth, an assumption can be that the average is around the stochiometric (14.7:1)air fuel mixture."
1,the gauge is poorly made,"I bought one of these for my grand prix,easy to put in but did not work.I called the sunpro helpline to firgure out what was wrong,they said it was a bad internal ground.So I sent it back and ask for anothor one.When I got it had the same problem, sent it back and got a refund this time.[By the way the problem ground makes the gauge read rich with car on or off nonstop]"
5,Spooky Mansion Fun,My 7 year old daughter loved playing this game. It was hard to get her to turn it off when her time limit was up. I played with her some & enjoyed it also. We have several I Spy products & like them all.
4,Unix advanced people only,"I got this book to learn about TCP/IP in general, but it is not for me. It for UNIX administrators as clearly marked along the top of the book which I should have seen in the preview picture. I was looking for something that explained the workings of the internet and networking for someone familiar with windows-based networking.It did have one useful chapter for me on what an IP address really is, and how packets fly through networks, and it looks good on the bookshelf in my office. So for this one chapter, and for it usefulness as a prop in my office, I give it four stars."
2,A book that [is awful],"Yeah, this one really [is awful]. I did not find it useful at all. It is just another step-by-step how-to book (seems like a cooking book), with poor and halfway explanations. Not recommended for serious network administration."
5,"Fantastic, another gen from O'Reilly","Another ""must have"" book from O'Reilly. I don't know how they manage it, but those guys are the masters of no-bull hard core technical writing. TCP/IP network administration is of the same high quality as all other works from this publisher."
4,Good intorduction into TCP/IP with some length besides TCPIP,"The book gives a good introduction into the basics of networking as well as the OSI model in brief. It is quite well structured with lots of good examples. One drawback I found, that it mainly refers to unix and has a quite lengthy part in explaining sendmail - which is in my opinion a bit 'off topic' In summary it is still a good introduction. I've learned most of my basics about TCP/IP and routing from this book."
3,Doesn't come with cables needed,"It seems to work fine, but it did not come with the video cable that is needed for it to work, therefore I had to go back and get something else in order for it to work."
1,Mis-Marketing,Buyer Beware. This is NOT a USB console extender. It is a PS2 console extender. In order for this product to be a USB console extender you have to use PS2 to USB adapters which really defeats the purpose of buying a USB extender in the first place. To call this a USB extender amounts to false advertising.
1,terrible ..got me a burn,"Terrible product. i don't recommend , i got severe burn in my ears and forehead 10 min after using it at a salon. I spent the night in the ED.dont recommend to a friend."
2,Motions disappointment,I tried Motion relaxer after 8 years of wearing my medium to corse hair natural. My hair was relaxed by a professional and the product directions were followed according to the instructions. After 3 attempts over 20 weeks to straighten my hair with Motions it straigthen my hair nicely. It was managable full and healthy looking. Over the next month my hair started to dry out and shed dramatically. My stylist used sevaral treatments for breakage and my hair continued to shed so I braided my hair to save what was left from additional breakage. The best product from Motions is the Moisturizing Conditioner my hair felt great when using it but once it was rinsed my hair started to dry out. I would not recommend this product for dry hair this is medium to corse.
1,Doesn't straighten!!,This relaxer did not straighten my hair at all!! it was like i had washed my hair and blow dried it.It didn't seem like i put a relaxer in it.
3,Works okay,I have been through a couple gas soldering irons and this one seems to hold up okay. i do see some heat tarnishing on the tips so i'm not all that impressed with the metal quality. could be a little better for the price but all in all if you are a person who needs a high quality soldering iron your going to have to pay the high dollars for a real workstation.
4,Quality Non-Stick Griddle,"I have owned two of these pans. The first wore out after several years of daily use. Note that the package says ""non-stick"" and not ""non-stick forever"". Eventually, all non-stick pans wear out. Out of the box, this pan is magic. Nothing will stick and it cleans up beautifully. The pan is also nice and thick. I have never had a problem with warping, however heating this pan really hot and then rinsing it in the sink could cause warping. To maximize the life of the pan, be sure to NEVER use aerosol oils such as PAM on the pan. The propellant in the can burns at a lower temperature than the oil, and ends up burning in the pores of the pan surface. It will not take long to destroy the non-stick finish. Also, allow the pan to cool COMPLETELY before washing it to prevent any warpage. No gritty cleaners either. The pan should last for many years and then you can buy another one."
5,Fast and Flat,"I agree with the reviewers who detailed how lightweight, nonstick, and evenly heated this griddle is, but I have had a different experience than those who found it warped. I set it on several surfaces in my kitchen, and it laid perfectly flat every time. Perhaps there was a bad batch, or Anolon has corrected the problem.Anyway, another reason I love this griddle is for how quickly it heats. With it I need a lower heat setting than with my heavy Anolon skillet, and my pancakes cook significantly faster (I actually burned the first 2). I can whip out a stack in about 1/3 the time I did before, which makes me more likely to do more complicated recipes (like yogurt and banana pancakes-mmm) or add bacon and eggs to a meal.Add all this to the fact that I paid 1/2 the price on Amazon than what I found it for in a department store (and got free 2 day shipping with Prime), and I could not be happier with my purchase."
4,"Pancakes, anyone?",I bought this griddle for my father. The griddle he has used for many years is heavy and lately sticks more often than not. A plus for this griddle it is heavy yet lighter and easier to handle than his old one and the handles are wonderful. My only disappointment is that it is so narrow. I would have liked it to be about 2 inches wider.
3,Not flat!,"Although the quality of the material seems very good, we were disapointed that the griddle doesn't lay flat on our ceramic surface stove."
1,Never comes clean,I have had this pan for over a year now and it is going in the donate pile. The coating has come off the bottom of the pan from trying to clean it. The cooking surface looks disgusting and I don't feel like I can ever get it clean either.
1,Not flat,"I chose this product based on the reviews in Cooks Illustrated. It seems as though their reviews are a bit out of date. I can see how this may be a good griddle, as my pancakes were cooked nicely. Unfortunately it was convex along the long axis causing them to run for their lives to the edge. I ordered a replacement, hoping that it was just a defective griddle. The replacement arrived and I held a straightedge to the bottom and noticed a 1/4""+ gap near the center.I'm back to looking for a decent two burner griddle..."
3,Good Enough,"I got this as a napping cot in my home office. My goal was to get something I could setup in a sleepy moment and crash for a couple hours. This pretty much fits that, but not quite.Cons:It takes a couple minutes to setup even after having done it a few times.Getting that last pin in is very tricky. I'm hoping the nylon material will stretch out over time so this is easier. MAKE sure you use the longer bar last when putting the cot together: it allows more leverage for the last pin.Pros:Stores fairly small for its size.Fits a 6'+ guy with no problems.Very comfortable."
4,Well made product,"Received as expected, good size. A little tough to put to together because the fabric was new. I figure as it is used it would get easier. (which it did the second time I put it together). Take down was easy and stores neatly in bag provided. I would suggest to use it with a camping mat or inflatable cushion. Bottom line, would purchase again."
4,Five star camping,"One of the concessions I make to camping at my advanced age is COMFORT. This cot is incredibly comfortable because it is so roomy. It is 31 inches wide so it prevents my hands from falling overboard at night. It is 84"" long. It has enough real estate to accommodate my Thermarest Base Camp XL self-inflating mattress. It is high off the ground so it is easy to get into and out of. I was so pleased with this product that I bought a second one. I own several other Texsport products. The only reason I rated it with 4 stars is because it takes a lot of muscle to assemble."
2,I would not recommend you to buy this item,"Hard to assemble. You need to ask someone to help to put it together.I immediately return and purchased ""easy cot""."
2,Let her rip.,"I have had two of these jumbo camp cots (one was a replacement)and I must say that unless you use this thing sparingly, be prepared for the canvas fabric to rip and tear along it's longitudinal seams.This renders this cot useless/non-repairable.I am 250 lbs.It is supposed to be rated to 300 lbs. Caveat Emptor."
5,susan raye,"This is an old CD, but the songs are wonderful. It brings back a lot of memories and I would recommend it to everyone."
3,Not the best Horror Anthology for the year.,"I've been a consistant reader from Volume I on of this anthology, but I must admit that lately the selections have been dissappointing. It seems as if Stephen Jones must always include some of the same authors in every volume, even though there are better horror stories from other authors not included for that year.For this year, the landmark 999 was clearly the best horror anthology, of which this volume contains only two stories (the ones by Klein and Campbell). Clearly the 999 stories by Ligotti, Lansdale and Oates were far better than the majority of the stories included in Best New Horror 11.Still, you might find the little Halloween vignettes by Tem amusing and the Schow story Unshaped a bit disconcerting, but I think, aside from the Campbell story (see 999), Peter Straub's story of a legendary Jazz saxaphonist is quite superb.Hopefully Jones will be more discriminating in the future, rather than continually playing his favourites."
4,Nicholas Cricket,This is a tale about a cricket and his band. They play beautiful music for all of the animals that come to the lake. The name of the band is the Bug-a-Wug Cricket Band. Their favorite place to play is at the Little Lake and the Little Stream. This story is mainly about how soft and beautiful their bands music sounds and how it gets all of the animals to dance and have a good time. It is a good book if you would like to read it.Josh V.
5,Beautiful illustrations,"This book is full of beautiful, rich illustrations. I enjoy it just as much as my 2.5 yr old who insisted we read it every night for a month!"
3,This was an ok story for children,I'd expected a little more the story was alright but nothing that would stick with you. I was a little disappointed in the book.
5,Jan Howard,I always wondered why she looked so sad. I'm so glad I found her book and a good price so I could read about her life. She's quite a woman! I'm hoping her life since the time of the publishing has been happier and that she is fulfilled in every way.
3,It's okay for me,I used to take L-Carnitine but not Acetyl L-Carnitine and I don't know what is the difference between these two things.
4,FLOWERS,"THE CARDS ARE BEAUTIFUL, HOWEVER THE ENVELOPES COULD BE BETTER AS TO NOT QUITE BE THE SAME DEPTH IN COLOR AS THE CARDS ARE. YOU NEED MORE ROOM FOR ADDRESSES."
1,This Book [is bad]!!,"This is one of the worst books I've ever read. I don't know what should be good about this [book]. Weak storyline, no suspense, and not a very good use of language. Don't buy this!"
3,Some repeats,"Hansen is a fine writer, and this is a good collection, but the reader should be warned that it has only 6 stories, 3 of which appeared in his earlier collections --""Surf"" in Brandstetter & Others (1984), and ""An Excuse for Shooting Earl"" and ""Molly's Aim"" in Bohannon's Country, 1993. Moreover, another story, ""Home Is the Place,"" later appeared in Bohannon's Women, 2002. The publisher should object (to someone or other) that ""Home is the Place"" was reprinted so quickly."
3,Lovely,This was a lovely platter. I have since found some that were similar for a little less at discount stores but still worth the value. It was a gift to my mom and she uses it as a turkey platter.
4,good steamer device,This is a good steamer insert device. But the material is much thinner that I though.
1,"Western Digital, this drive is unstable...","I bought this drive 5 months ago, and used it for video backups from my iMac. It worked perfectly until I accidentally hit the plug with my foot and powered it down - it wasn't in the process of doing anything at the time, but that was enough for it to stop working, and start the dreadful clickling and clacking of doom. Luckily western digital has a good warranty, and they sent me a replacement drive.The rainy season was opon us here in southern california recently, and we had one 2 minute power outage, and my replacement drive once again went kablooie, clicking and clacking, making me want to beat it with a two by four until it followed orders, but all was in vain, and here on my desk sits a shiny brand new western digital replacment. Anyone want to buy a brand new drive? I'll go buy a maxtor or something else, anything else. 3 drives later it still sucks, don't buy this."
2,"Mine died after 17 months, just outside of warranty period","Purchased 7/27/03 (the 120G, pink neon, usb/iee1394), died 2 weeks ago, serious bummer. I was in the process of backing up a full 120G+ of data from a RAID 0 array. Full drive powered down and just decided to come back on with a series of very loud ""clicks and buzzing"", after of course I had formatted my source drives with only about 1/4 of all work backed up on DVD's. A valuable lesson, in how not to trust a single back up option. From the similiar reviews, I would steer clear of these, an internal drive of similiar capacity would save you a lot of $$$ (I paid $250 for this flashy monstrosity), and be arguably more reliable. If you are in need of the portability, get a removable 5.25"" bay for less than $20. This will be my last WD, as it's the 3rd to go down on me just past warranty."
1,Lost 2 of these,I have lost 2 of these drives in 2 years. First one died in Last December after ~ 9 months of use (video & still image storage). WD repalced with another one and Lost it today (12/25/2004 - merry f* christmas WD). At lest I have all my digital images copied on my wifes system.Don't buy it! You will be sorry.
3,A tAst of the wild,when I order this book i was underthe impression it was like a field guide for edible wild plants in the northeastern US.IT IS NOT its filled with a few recipes for wild plant dishes and other wise its more of a biography of the author
1,Not worth the money,This book is largely useless as a guide for identifying wild edible plants. There are no photos and few sketches. I know many of the plants that are in it but would not be able to identify them with any confidence by the sketches in this book if I did not. It does have recipes in it but you would need another source to identify the plants used in them.
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I spent 17 years working as a natural resource manager in Alaska and I'm quite familiar with the glaciers of the 'last frontier'. I bougtht this video to help my 'Lower=48"" girlfr4iend learn more about glaciers. What a disappointment!! The video has almost nothing to recommend it. Many of the video images are unclear and the features to be illustrated are often difficult to discern. But the worst problem is the scripting and narration. The script consists mainly of literally hundreds of glacier-related statistics and measurments (down to 0.001 mm!)and often unclear explanations of far too many technical terms that no one but a professional glaciologist coulc possibly need. On the whole, it is a stunningly dull presentation! If you want a lucid and entertaining explanation of the origin, nature, and role of glaciers as part of Earth's landscapes, look elsewhwere. This video is a waste of time and money."
1,Glaciers,This video has great photography but the narration doesn't seem to always fit what is being shown. It is hard to watch and stay awake.
3,Super Reader,"Two years after the events in Ghostbusters 2 the boys are doing their thing, and at the moment, are pretty busy.Spook activity is up, and in the form of ghosts of urban legends, which is pretty odd, as anything that wasn't real shouldn't have a ghost.The Independent Party (yeah, that is what I thought) has a plan. Because the Ghostbusters make the incumbent mayor look good whenever they save the day, and the city keeps forgetting to pay them, they decide to recruit Venkman to run for them.Add in the cause of the spook trouble, your demon lord masquerading as a ghostfinder, and you have a fairly amusing Ghostbusters story."
5,easy to understand,"I have previous experience in thai boxing but this book taught me quite a few things to better my performance. It teaches all of the basics such as boxing,elbows,knees,and kicking. When you get right down to it ..its the basics that win the fight not the flashy stuff. The best part about this book is that it comes with a 3 month training regime that if fllowed exactly as it says will make you a dangerous person. The only thing that i felt was incomplete was the ""self protection"" chapter..not that it was fake or anything its just that it emphasizes that you do not finish off your opponent ......but other than that the chapter is still amazing. Just remember that there is no room for mercy or sportsmanship on the street."
3,Not so Ultimate Muay Thai,"This book was too low on detail. Gives very little instruction on HOW to perform moves and the photos are no help at all. While it does give a good background on muay thai history and gives an excellent vocabulary for the moves, I just felt that it was not very helpful for touching up my technique or learning from. If you're looking to learn HOW to do muay thai, I recommend NOT buying this book - you'll be as disappointed as I was."
1,proceed with caution,As an ex student of Bob's I was disappointed to find out that his SAS background was a complete fabrication designed to add credibility to his commercial enterprises. The first review here giving the book 5 stars also appears to be from Bob using a pseudonym. My reason for advising people to exercise caution is that Bob's muay thai credentials are now also in question and therefore this book may not necessarily be relied upon as an accurate teaching guide.
2,Not for production work.,"This might be a great mike for a megachurch pastor or a jazzercize instructress. That is probably the intended market. We are using it for voice recording in video production and the results are distinctly inferior to our previous system of stand-mounted microphones. I hoped proximity would be more important than electronics, but this was proven wrong."
2,Misnomer,"Excellent cast, however not enough dialogue nor adventure for the Seven Cities they were in search of. Only 3 were slightly addressed in the movie. Granted, the priest was benevolent, but because he was given too much focus, the efforts of the Spanish conquest paled in significance. The Title ""The Mission Priest"" more accurately describes this movie, and it should be placed under a ""Religious"" rather than ""Historical"" category."
2,Too short,Well made but way to short to be effective in my bench (bench thickness approx. 3.5 inches). Would recommend purchasing the longer one if you want a hold down clamp.
1,This holdfast is just too small,I am unable to get this holdfast to grip and hold anything. I find it unusable.
1,Poor quality,"This was suppose to be a 3/4"" hold down. It measures about 9/16"" and does not fit properly in the holes in my work bench. Quality of what appears to be a casting is very poor and likely would break after a few hammer blows. This was billed as a quality item to fit a 3/4"" bench hole-----------far from it. Extremely disappointed and will be returning for refund. I feel ripped off having to shell out for shipping fees after being duped by false advertising."
5,Zula Patrol!,I recommend Zula Patrol to any parent that wants thier children to learn about science. It is a very educational show!
4,A Must Have for Fans of Serbian Gypsy Brass,"Any serious fan of Goran Bregovic, Kocani Orkestar, Boban Markovic, or Gypsy Brass in general should add this set to their collection. It offers a 40 year retrospective of the best Serbian brass bands; recordings of which would be difficult to find anywhere else. The selections on both CDs cover the range of brass music, from coceks to kolos, as well as slower pieces showcasing solo playing talents. Two-plus hours of bliss for the Gypsy Brass enthusiast."
4,Good Reference,"This serves as a good reference book. Saved lot of time many, many times. I bought this book 2+ yrs ago and still helps me out. But I think this book needs a major update. Oracle8i is a new beast altogether (I didn't work with 9i yet) and there are tons of new built-in packages that are very useful."
2,Better call it: O'reilly build-in packages,"Very little about Oracle build-in packages. Much more about O'reilly's own build-in packages, it is more like a kind of ads.I want to use packages, doesn't mean I want O'reilly packages. If you want to sell O'reilly packages, name the book accordingly.I wanted to know more about the numerous oracle standard build-in packages, this book didn't help me."
2,More for reading than for cooking from,"A fun read, but the recipes aren't reliable. I've used this book for an enjoyable read, and to come up with ideas for things to cook, but I don't cook from it any more -- most of the dishes I have tried either were not particularly good or they didn't come out right at all."
3,"Well, the recipes aren't all that good","Funny, I like their style, but the recipes are definitely English and not really new or different. If you buy cookbooks to cook, you might not find this useful. If you buy cookbooks to read, you'll enjoy it."
3,The Adult Chocolate Cake recipe is KILLER!,Laughter is the exercise you'll get while reading this book. Heartattacks are what you'll get if you actually eat the food. The chocolate cake recipe is almost worth a heartattack!
5,Irene,"I liked this book a lot. The personalities of ""The Two Fat Ladies"" shown through. I watch the reruns of their show often and have seen them prepare recipes on the show that are in the book."
1,Bad switch,"The scope arrived very quickly, and broke just as fast.After only two days of use the on off switch would no longer turn onrendering the scope useless."
4,hear clear again,Good product Worked just great.Amozon always has great prices and products you can trust. Dick Mc Namara
3,Philips Tape Head Cleaner Cassette with Solution...,"The Philips Cassette Head Cleaner with solution is a good product if you have an older type tape deck in your vehicle. You have to insert the cassette immediately after applying the solution or it will evaporate (most likely alcohol). Tape decks in home stereo equipment or boom boxes can be cleaned with rubbing alcohol and a q-tip, but tape decks in vehicles are too difficult to reach this way. I recommend this product for cleaning tape heads that can't otherwise be manually cleaned."
1,jams in cassette player,"What a piece of crap. Waited a week to get this product. I have a strong grip, but had to some pliers to force a few drops out of the container. Then I put the cassette in and it got stuck. It took me 4 minutes to get it out. Tried it again and it got stuck again. I thought I broke the drive, but I tried a tape and it worked.Don't waste your time on this product!"
2,No reply....,"When I received this product (brand new and unopened), I went to use it and discovered that the bottle of cleaner was completely empty. It had evaporated! I tried to use my own isopropyl alcohol, and a Q-tip, to get it in the cassette head but it didn't work very well.I e-mailed the seller and never heard back!"
2,Does the thought even count?,"The cassette part of the cleaner worked fine, but the bottle of cleaner is IMPOSSSIBLE to use. Why? Because the plastic bottle is too thick to squeeze. In the end I just used regular, over the counter ethyl alcohol.Aside from that, the product arrive on time and in good condition, and worked well once I added the ethyl alcohol."
1,Could not use product,I am usually pleased with Amazon products but not with this one. My cassette recorder needed cleaning so I purchased two cleaners. Neither one worked. This one arrived and the tape was crinckled and very dry. Even adding the liquid did not help. The tape could have been old and dried out I guess. All I know is it wasn't usable. Defective.
4,I love A Skylit Drive but...,"this is my least favorite album by them, its with there original singer (Jordan Blake) who in MY opinion is not as talented as Jag."
2,very basic,"i bought this book expecting an intermediate/advanced discussion of grammar aimed at native english speakers who are trying to learn japanese. in fact, it offers a very basic overview of english grammar, and then simply shows how these simple points are conveyed in japanese. this is useful, yes. but not to someone who has previously spent a decent amount time studying english grammar, another foreign language, or japanese. with title chapters like ""what is a noun,"" ""what is a pronoun,"" and ""what is a personal pronoun"" (the 1st three chps of this book), this is certainly not advanced grammar. there are a thousand basic japanese books that cover these same points, teach way better japanese, and use hiragana.unless you are really unsure of basic grammatical points (nouns, verbs, tense...), i would recommend skipping this book. i can use it with the beginner japanese students i am teaching english too, but otherwise it would have been a complete waste of money for me."
5,EXCELLENT,"I've been a fan of Freda's since the ""Invictus Years"" and haven't heard anything new from her since. I missed the Capital and Dunhill/ABC cuts but I was glad to get a hold of the live cd. While I am not a real big fan of live albums (the music never sounds the same) I really enjoy this cd. I had to listen to this cd a few times and like all of Freda's music it got me hooked. I never heard her do any jazz and this cd has a number of classics from jazz greats. Eartha Kitt made a contribution which was quite humorous after Freda's impersonation of C'Est Si Bon. The lady still can sing and from the cover of the cd her looks are only getting better with age. It was also great to hear some of her Invictus material live. So why don't you pour yourself a glass of wine and kick back and enjoy this diva's show. Keep on going Freda!!!"
5,"Little pot, but mighty pot!","This is a great little pot. Perfect for small sauces, melting butter, etc. It's nice not to dirty a larger pot for these smaller jobs. Love the handle and finish."
5,Love these Pans,I purchased these pans a while back and absolutely love them. They are a bit heavy - but cook great and evenly. I didn't understand even cooking until I got these. And the fact that you can put these in the dishwasher is wonderful. I highly recommend them. And have purchased additional pans since the original set. I've had these for about 3 years now and still love them.
5,Works as described!,"I bought this as a hub for a PS3. So far it works just fine when all ports are used. Mine didn't come with an AC adapter, just the USB cable. In the instructions, it says the cable supplies the power to box. Two connections at 500mA each means this box gets 1 amp total power. I'm sure it works fine with any other computer, it's just that I only bought it for the PS3."
4,Great basic joystick,I would give this thing a 5 if I didn't have to recalibrate it sooooo much. It's quiet and accurate. Also the adjustibility is great.
5,7 years of use later: still beautiful,"My wife and I received this bowl as a wedding present in 2000. Nearly eight years later it is still as nice as it was new. We use it regularly and have had no issues with cracks, chips, etc. Basically the bowl looks brand new. If you like the Italian Countryside style from Mikasa, you can't go wrong here."
3,Good Bang for the Buck,"Got it working half an hour after I took it out of the box, BUT on the second time around. Turns out the first one I received was defective--wouldn't pick up an IP address nor broadcast its MAC. You need to launch the included PSAdmin utility to initially see the unit. The initial config. is not to use DHCP, which doesn't make sense. Anyway, after assigning it a static IP, it was up and running. Noticed the Network Print Port was not supported in XP Home, though Standard TCP/IP (LPR) is; in Win2k, I was able to use the Network Print Port. 3 stars because of poor documentation and web support, plus questionable quality control. Hope this helps."
1,Not impressed,"I tried to install this using 3 different machines (XP & 2000) on my network with no success. It would not grab an IP address from the DHCP server, so I couldn't get to it onto the network. I called tech. support and they had no clue. Easier to return it to Amazon and try another manufacturer than try and troubleshoot something that should just work.The User Manual is a joke. They actually have a page that ends in mid-sentence. The install program ends with an option to view the readme file... but it doesn't exist. Very sloppy product management team at IOGear... no wonder I've never heard of them before."
2,"Not happy, tried really hard to be","I first purchased the 802.11b version of this USB printserver. It didn't work. I tried serveral access points including the Cisco CS1100, and the netGear MR812v2. Ended up sending it back to get the wired version in hopes it would clear up the problems. After hasseling with their support they finally granted me an RMA, but I had to fight for it. Two months later, I got a replacement unit. Then they billed me for a new unit! More problems I didn't need. The thing did work for a while, and is now on the fritz again.I'm not going to bother with it anymore. I could have built a print server for the amount of time I have put into this afair. Stay away from these jokers, unless you have a lot of time on your hands, and money you like to give away for products that are not ready for prime time."
1,I am sure it's great...IF IT WORKED!,"Tried installing this thing using a Lexmark z23 printer (listed as a compatible printer). After installing it once without luck, I downloaded the latest drivers...still no dice. I was using two XP machines without success.It gets an IP address from my router and I can ""ping"" it from the browser interface, but I just can't print. One machine did nothing while the other one just fed the paper through. Neither printed a single character.I really cannot recommend this device."
3,"Good box, obscure configuration.","Just bought this used and I thought I would post how to get it to work.1. If you're using XP, you must have IPX protocol enabled. Then use the iogear print monitor application to configure IP.2. If you're using OSX, you must use appletalk to connect to this print server. Alternatively you can use IP (lpr) if you configure the GPSU01's IP configuration via a windows box first.If you want a print server that just works, you should look for something else."
1,"Terrible terrible service, incorrect web site","I purchased this (not at Amazon but at a brick & mortar site) item as their website listed ""incompatible printers"" and mine wasnt listed. I opened it up and tried it out and it didnt work. I tried many things (updating drivers etc) and still nothing. The only way to contact IOGEAR for help was email. I emailed for help and no reply. I returned the item and lost 15% restocking fee. A MONTH LATER IOGEAR replied saying I should have known it was incompatible. HUH? What am I? A mindreader? No further response, apology, explanation or even my lost 15% was given. CRAPPY service, slow response and unreliable information. Spend your hard earned cash on a device made by a more reputable manufacturer."
1,What a nightmare!!!,"I've now been through 2 of these things. First one would could not be found by the setup software. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with someone in the IOGear tech support department. He was very patient and very helpful. He walked me through many different solutions. Unfortunatly none of them worked. He suggested that the unit I had was deffective and I should try another, which I did. I exchanged the unit for another and still have all of the same problems. Tried it on 2 different computers. I give up."
3,Hard to replace the real Flatts,"Even though these artists sang some great songs on this tribute to Rascal Flatts, it's hard to listen to the music without yearning to hear Gary, Joe Don, and Jay blend their voices together to create that harmony that makes you want to ""melt."" This album deserves 3 stars for showcasing some awesome songs, but if you are a die-hard Rascal Flatts fan, you'll wanna stick to the good ole ""Prayin' For Daylight"" and ""Melt"" albums."
1,has anyone actually listened to this?,"it's nice that someone wanted to do a tribute album, but this sounds horrible. I like rascal flatts and this doesn't do them justice. The voices on this album are weak and off key. I wouldn't waste my time buying this."
1,Turn the volume WAY down,"This CD is a total disaster. I don't know who's bright idea it was to do a tribute album, but they are NOT doing a favor to Rascal Flatts."
1,I've heard it wasn't that great but I wanted to say...,"I was reading the above reviews before considering to buy this cd, and one of them said that Rascal Flatts didn't want to be associated with country music. I am a HUGE fan of theirs and they are a country band. I'm not sure if I just misunderstood the review or not, but I just wanted to clarify that they definately are an amazing country band!"
1,Just say no,"This is the worst CD in my collection. I am keeping it though to pass along as a gag gift. Painful. Painful. Why didn't I read the reviews before I dropped this one in the shopping cart. Stick to the karaoke, guys."
1,TERRIBLE,Avoid this cd at all costs. It is not worth your money and it does NOT pay tribute to Rascal Flatts. The men in this group are much more talented vocally and musically than this cd provides. Save yourself the trouble and BUY THE REAL THING!!!
5,Every Word user should own this book,"O'Reilly has done it again. I use Word a lot and none of the books I've found got past the basics. In fact, most of the books I've looked at were 600-800 pages of fluff that did little more than rehash information in the Word help files.The Nutshell series has always been able to provide solid, no-nonsense advice about using software and Word 2000 in a Nutshell lives up to the Nutshell tradition. Every time I open the book, I find one of those smack myself in the head solutions for some annoying problem or a great tip for making Word do what I need it to.If you use Word, do yourself a favor and buy this book! My only complaint is that it didn't come out sooner."
2,Word 2000 in a Nutshell,"Segments of information on one topic are scattered in various locations of the book, i.e., one can't get an answer to a particular question when there is no immediate continuity for a topic in one area."
4,Good Series,Have really enjoyed this series of books. The only curse is that there's information relative to period that you need to get the overall context of the period to know what's going on and after the umpteenth book it's way too familiar. For those who are new to the series or are reading as a one-off I get the need but it's my only gripe :)
5,Whispers of the Dead: Fifteen Sister Fidelma Mysteries (Sister Fidelma Mysteries),Book was in good condition and was packaged well for shipping. Delivery of package was received prior to the expected delivery date. Recommended.
1,Very disappointing,"We were looking for some nice family Christmas videos and were very disappointed in both of these. Both movies had good basic stories, but they are definitely not family friendly because of the gay agenda that was evident in both videos. One ended with showing two men in bed, and the other presented two gay men celebrating with their friends over their upcoming marriage. We will be throwing away both films."
5,Welsh's Synthesizer Cookbook,"Product arrived in perfect condition and signed by the Author as well! Absolutely awesome book and it is exactly what it claims to be, a cookbook, with clear concise examples of how to make sounds from scratch. Absolutlely a must have for anyone who wants to push the envelope!"
1,Fake patches !!!,"author mentioned that there is a wide array of synths that is suitable to program the patches... LIE !!!! i couldnt find one that could implement all the tweaks as in the book..... when i found the best suitable synth, Albino 3...i programmed all patches in the author book sample and none sounded like what the name of the patches implied..... i noticed some weird settings on the filter that didnt make any sense too..... i am glad i didnt buy this book and didnt waste my money......"
1,Not recieved,I wish I could. I have not recieved my item. I purchased the item 04/17/09. It's now 05/18/09.
2,Still Haven't Received,I still have not received this book. I ordered it over a month ago. Where is it?
2,flavorful gum that doesn't last long...,Love the flavor of this gum but the flavor just doesn't last and the gum gets tough quickly.
3,beautiful illustrations,Children will be able to relate to the young girl's idea of a lucky day. They will also ask you to do as the last page says and go back to the beginning.
5,Bratz Back to school Cloe,I really like Cloe's converse shoes! I definitely want this Cloe! Her out fit is tooo cute ^^*J3SSICA*&&I; love the Bratz...but end the dollie war! Peace and Love##
4,Fighting Irish Throw,Nice full size throw for lounging or on top of the bed. Colors are bright and throw's a soft blend.
1,This title and jacket cover dupe you,"I just returned from a book club which read this book after seeing it had 4 stars in a ""book club newsletter."" Not one of the 8 of us liked it. We all felt it was poorly written. An historical, informational piece of work attempting to be a novel; having poorly evolved characters, spagetti plot lines, etc. The ending falls flat while playing out as the potential for a sequel - but not in a way that any of us would care to read it."
4,Excellent book for someone feeeling totally confused.,"I was totally confused about where I was and where I wanted to go with the rest of my life. Mark Gerzon gives wonderful examples of others that have faced similar questions in their own life from Buzz Aldrin to many of his own everyday patients. Although not every chapter was of interest, I found this to be an excellent jumping off place for my own quest to integrate my ""Shadow Side"" with the successful life I had achieved so far. I wish I had read this before I started my own search for my ""second half of my life"" identity."
3,Not Bad - but didn't hold my interest,This book wasn't bad but it took alot to hold my interest. I lost interest about half way through and had to struggle to try to finish it. I never did finish it but the content wasn't bad and seemed very truthful.A man's perspective on midlife was also very good and different from other books I have read on the subject.
5,great case,Just got this case and am very pleased that it fits my Mathews Z7. It was hard finding one that worked. The hard rubber on the ends is awesome. I think this is going to protect my bow fine and its not too bulky. I would highly recommend this case.
5,"Finally, the truth....","Much more real information than you will ever find in slick gunzines so beholden to their advertisers...Mssrs. Bates and Cumpston pull no punches and give fair and accurate descriptions of the guns, the makers, shooting techniques, near everything the intrepid shootist might want to know before embarking on a journey to The Dark Side....and they do this at the same time they provide a rollicking and entertaining ride through history...an exceptional book destined to be read and reread...."
4,"More of a refence than a ""how -to""","OK, I bought this as a ""how-to"" for my ""new"" hobby, black powder revolvers. As such, it's OK, but still left some gaps in what I wanted to know. As I don't know any BP revolver shooters, I've had to learn this all myself, and this really didn't do that for me.But, as a reference book this would rate a SOLID 5 stars. This covers the topic from end to end and in depth. For this purpose the book is excellent. If that's your need, I highly recommend it."
1,Falls twxit the cracks,"This book is a complete disappointment, with a complete lack of focus. If the authors were addressing new buyers or shooters the text is incomplete, and filled with generalities in lieu of specifics. If the book is directed towards the more knowledgeable reader, the insights and information, when even offered, are too basic to be of use. This is one of the few books that I have purchased through Amazon that could have been avoided by only the briefest of perusals."
3,Great Book Misleading promotional material,"I am pleased with the book with one major exception. The book's promotional material here on Amazon shows large color pictures. Copy these for your viewing pleasure because that is all you are going to see. The book in a smaller format and everything is printed in black & white. The diagrams of the pistols parts, text in the pictures, etc are too small to see and be useful. The textural information however is VERY good. This is the only book I have found on the subject but it's presentation could be improved upon."
4,great resource for caplocks,"Well-written, lots of information about caplocks during their brief but important period of use. I was not disappointed in the reason for purchase which was the honest reviews of modern replicas. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars are the pictures and awful Old English font used. A 19th century one would have been better. Maybe in the 2nd edition they will make some changes."
4,Nice package for a nice price!,"Even though I like Westerns, I can't say the movies in this package are all excellent; they range from good to maybe very good at best.Warner does its job again and the picture quality is very nice and aspect ratios preserved. If you like actors like Robert Taylor, William Holden and Glenn Ford, and Gregory Peck, you may want to consider getting this box set since it also has a good price.Considering everything, I gave the package 4 stars but the movies would get between 3 and 4 stars from me."
5,Another great Christmas gift for my brother!,"When he and the ""guys"" go hunting up the cabin they had the same old western videos to watch (vcr no less). He was thrilled to open this and it's going up to the cabin on the next trip."
4,Western Classics,This is a great bargain. As a western movie fan (freak) I have really enjoyed these movies. The quality of these movies is great.
3,3 from the Collection were Better,"The Stalking Moon,Cimarron ? and Saddle the Wind (Julie London) were Nice to See the Big Star like Peck,Glenn Ford and Robert Taylor in Action"
5,Beautiful Blender!,"I bought this blender because of the copper. My kitchen is done with copper faucets, etc and it seems these days that everyone has a stainless steel obsession so it's so hard to find stuff that matches my kitchen. This looks so nice I keep it out on the counter rather than in the appliance cubby. It's no louder than my 13yr old Cuisanart was, and it works a LOT better. It chops up anything I throw in it incredibly quickly. This was worth every penny."
5,Oster Improved,I had some bad memories of some poor engines on previous Oster blenders but this one really rocks (it could probably crush them too). Just make sure you have it turned off before plugging it in. I didn't think I would like the on/off option instead of the supposed variable speeds of other blenders but I really love this blender. It is easy to pulse when you want to slow down the blending.
5,Love this blender!,"I read previous reviews on this item about how LOUD it is. And I thought, well, all blenders are annoyingly loud. Yes, it is loud, but man does it do the job. Two settings; GO ALL THE WAY and PULSE. That's all you need. None of this liquify, blend, whip, puree, blah blah blah. I never did see a difference in anything I whipped versus pureed! Thought I was doing something wrong, now I know it's just a bunch of bologne! The copper looks great on my counter too, with my other copper accents in the kitchen!"
2,Wow. TOO LOUD!,"I had read some reviews of this product under the stainless steel model. People said it was loud. I thought, of course it's loud, all blenders are loud. Received it today. Sounds like a jet engine is taking off in my kitchen. Yeah, that loud. The kids had their hands clamped over their ears and my husband and I were screaming over the noise. And I hadn't even added the ice yet! I got a large bath towel to wrap around the base and it muffled the sound somewhat, but I'm pretty sure I have permanent hearing loss.The copper is beautiful and it chopped the ice without struggling, but wow. SO LOUD!"
1,Follow the trend expressed here--do not buy this book!!,"I have never sent in a review of a book before, but I must for this poor excuse of a review book. Since there is no other book which has been written on reviewing for this mammoth test, you might easily be suckered into buying this. That would be a waste of your money! I teach AP Art History, and I hoped that the book would enable me to do a better job helping my students prepare for the notoriously difficult multiple choice sections. Well, many of the questions make no sense, and it is as if someone got this published with little knowledge of this test. Use the old released tests from the College Board, and don't waste your money on this sad excuse of a help."
2,Poor Book,"I bought this book in the last few weeks to help me with my AP ART HISTORY exam. Although the slide part of the book is somewhat helpful, the multiple choice and essay are compete trash. I honestly think that the author just took random questions from a old college Art History book. Most questions have nothing or very little to do with Art History or the AP test, and are extermely diffcult.I thought that if this book is like the AP test, I'm doomed. Well I took the AP test and can say that first off, it's very very easy. I scored a 5, but no thanks to this book......"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I am currently in AP Art History. After I purchased this book, I started taking the multiple choice practice tests. Since it seemed like the questions were completely out of the blue, I took the text to my art history teacher. He agreed and warned anyone else in the class about this review book, as it has absolutely nothing to do with the AP curriculum.If you buy this poorly-made, poorly-written spiral bound book, you are simply wasting your money. I believe the two 5 star comments at the bottom of this page are by Jack Rudman himself."
1,Rudman's AP Art History - Awful!,"This book was of little use in my preparation for the AP in Art History. It contained numerous questions that had little or nothing to do with the AP curriculum or test, which led me to doubt the usefulness of any of the questions. Having taken the actual exam, I can say with certainty that, although it is oone of the few available review books, it is certainly not worth the $29.95 that I paid."
1,Horrible,"When I first bought this book, I thought that the review questions were helpful. But as I progressed through the multiple choice questions, they got worse and worse. Towards the end, over half of them had nothing to do with the art history curriculum. Although this book is the only one available, it is definitely not worth the $30. Any student will do better reviewing with their own notes than with this book."
2,"Awful, wasting my $29.95....","I bought this book thinking that perhaps, out of all the reviews, the book could help me, NOPE. No help. As I opened it, I was astonished, the printing job of a $30 book seems to be made at Kinko's-- ridiculous. I don't know why Rudman even made the darn thing.Your best bet is the Annotated Mona Lisa. But beware, its is quite Annotated, you'll have to dual it with you actual textbook. I made charts for myself, it really helped me straighten out the time periods and artists, the process of making it was key or else I would post it up for some AHAPer's."
1,The material in this book is totally unrelated to the AP Art History,"If you are looking for an AP Art History book, this is not the one to buy, as the material covered in the book is totally unrelated to the exam."
5,"Without any other study guides, this is it","After using Rudman's book, I feel that I can easily prepare for the AP exam in May of 2001. I'm using the ""Gardner"" text (11th ed.) which is thicker than any other textbook I've ever used, and without these study questions, I'd have no idea how to review. My advice: If you're currently in an AP Art History class, get this book ASAP. It's worth the 24 bucks."
1,wheels for HealthOMeter scale,"I just received the 2nd set of wheels to fit my HealthOMeter scale, model 450kl, and they just won't work. Followed instructions and any variation I could come up with and they tip the scale and render it inoperable.Maybe if the wheels for the 450kl were sent instead of the wheels for the 400kl,402kl and 402lb they just might work."
5,Salt & Pepper YAY,"Well, we have the set of dishes and bowls from our wedding so I figured what a perfect 1 year anniversary gift right? Yeah well just make sure you let the salt shaker dry when you wash it before putting salt into it otherwise it gets all clumpy and wont come out. Other than that WOW the products are amazing. The salt and pepper come out onto my food in perfectly metered amounts every time ! MMMM YUMMY they make my food."
2,Style over Substance,"I was looking for a shoehorn, and I saw this. It was cheap, so I ordered it, figuring it would be good to have something small that I could keep in my satchel.PROS: It's compact, and does fit nicely in my satchel. The lint brush reminds me of the kind that my grandmother had when I was a child, so that's pretty neat. Having a small, reusable lint brush in my bag is better than keeping a disposable roller, or using the scotch tape at my desk.CONS: Thin aluminum should probably not be your first choice when making a shoehorn; it bent the first time I used it."
3,"Flimsy as a shoe horn, but de-linter is nice.","I bought this for my son who has trouble (as he doesn't like to untie his laces) getting his feet in his shoes. He tried this, but he was afraid to use a little force for fear of breaking it. Oh well."
2,Great as a lint brush...useless as a shoehorn,"I bought this because I needed a travel shoehorn when I was heading out on a trip. It would probably be a great shoehorn for low dress shoes, as I was trying to use it to put on a pair of boots, it was far to short to be of use to me."
3,It does the Job,It does the job but its small. So it doesn't cover that much area of removing hair and debris on your clothing.
2,not worth the money,Sadly this item is very flimsy and I'm not confident that it will work on a daily basis. I was hoping to give it to my children as stocking stuffers but it's not worth the money. Wish I had better things to say.
1,voice,This i purchased based on a recommendation. Onomatopoeia of a cat who is trying to add intellect and poetry to a song.Awful!
5,Another good read!!!,"I didn't think she could do it, but the author surpassed my expectations of this book! The way she makes the characters come alive in my mind is wonderful. The story line kept me on the edge to the very end only to NEED the next book in the series. I can hardly wait for Lady Blue to arrive to see what happens next!"
5,A fabulous novel,This is a wonderful book that brings to life an epic story about a woman with phycic powers meets one of those strong and silent types and of course the girls got an evil uncle after her there for making this story one of those romance books were the guy saves the world and gets the girl. Not that I don't like it it's fabulous for the brainwashed types who can't get enough of that stuff.
5,Ushering in a new era of popular culture criticism?,"Like Greil Marcus and Robert Palmer, Corbett looks at (popular?) culture as both a product of and a determinant of culture at large. As a postmodernist, he delves into genres that are largely devoid of quality criticism as few are up to the task. Actually he's probably more of a Nat Hantoff or Frank Kofsky of our time in that he's quick to support what may commonly be refered to as music that tries its listeners patience and willingness to explore. I used this book as a reference for my thesis and have recommended it to several people."
2,"Not bad, but kind of weak writing","This book had an ok plot, I guess, but the writing was mediocre at the best. The way that it had to keep belaboring the point about the religious message of the book lessened the impact of that message. The characters did not seem completely realistic for individuals living in a company town. If you are looking for purely a gentle read then this fits the bill, but if you are looking for anything deeper, or a really good bit of historical fiction then look elsewhere."
2,Too schmaltzy,These cards were just schmaltz and treacle. Not at all evocative of the past but a phony rendering. Stick with Victorian Papers for nostalgic cards.
3,literally slick!,"The scarf is attractive; however, the fabric is literally slick! Any knots come untied in less than an hour and the scarf creeps open even if you just drape it. I have a hard time keeping it from falling off. Hoping to use it with my winter coat, it might have a bit more grip than my neck!"
5,Q & A in MRI is an excellent resource.,"I used the first ed. of this book to study for my MR registry exam & found it most helpful in understanding pulse sequences & MRI physics. The author(s) answer the questions in concise, easy to understand jargon that won't confuse the student, yet is technical enough for experienced technologist's to benefit. The second ed. is a continuation of this tried & true method of teaching & I most certainly would recommend this book, especially for anyone that is just learning MRI or getting ready to sit for the registry exam.Greg Wassenberg, MSRS, RT(R)(N)(MR)MRI Technologist"
2,mri review,this book is an ok review of physics- several of the pages have virtually no ink on them and impossible to readsorry i made the investment
1,Made me break out,"I never, or hardly ever, get breakouts, but this cream really did it. I am not sure what ingredient in here made my skin react, but I can't recommend this product at all. It's pretty harsh on my skin. Maybe you will have better luck. I had to throw it out."
5,Great book!,"If you want to know how any kind of wireless technology works, this is the book for you. Whether it's wireless networks, wireless Internet access, cell phones, WAP, pagers, WSDL...it's all here. The introductory material is great for anyone wanting to understand concepts like how data and information can be sent wireless, how the electromagnetic spectrum works, etc. And even the more complicated material is easy to follow --- the illustrations are clear and are great for explaining wireless concepts. Anyone interested in wireless technology should get this book."
4,Good book for beginners,This book fulfills its role as the very first book one may wish to read if he/she knows nothing at all about wireless technology and wants a broad overview of the subject. The colorful pictures and brief text descriptions makes the book accessible to newbies. The reader is then prepared to move into more advanced books on this interesting subject.
4,Clear Cut,The book arrive in a timely manner. As I read it was very explanatory and clear. I am satisfied with the purchase of this book. It has renewed my interest in wireless.
2,Weak book,"I generally like this series, but this one is weak. Takes one idea and manages to fill up an entire book."
1,"misleading content coverage, misleading title",CAUTION: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ANY KIND OF IN-DEPTH COVERAGE OF WIRELESS BASICS.
3,50/50 on the 2 drums used,Ordered 2 of these for my F150 combined with a set of Raybestos PT Plus shoes. Installed one wheel and ran out of daylight. Felt very smooth on the test drive. Installed the other side the next day and the drum was out of round. Noticed it when I put it in but thought it was just the outside edge. Test drive showed shimmy when I used the brakes. Tried to get a replacement via Amazon but got an email saying they were out of stock and their alternate vendor wanted $17 to ship it so got it elsewhere online. Not my best experience with Amazon which is normally really good as I've bought over a hundred items from them over the last few years.
3,"Too much praise, not enough substance.","There is some very good material contained in this text. The problem is there is also a fair amount of ""We're GNU, we're great, here are the other books which will explain how to use this tool.""Practical C++ Programming, another O'Reilly text has 500+ pages and lists for $32.95. It is a great example of solid writing and is a great bang for the bucks. Programming with GNU Software has less than 250 pages and lists for $39.95. The writing style is weak and the flow is not as strong. Programming with GNU could easily drop 75 pages worth of self warm fuzzies, work a bit more on the flow of instruction, and include a little more info.Note: The three stars are for the content which was worth reading. This book is good for those who have little to no exposure to GNU environment. If you have some familiarity then get texts which address the specific tools."
4,Good overall view,"This book offers the >HIGHLIGHTS< of the GNU programming tools. E.g. Makefiles are covered by this book, but you wouldn't find all details of make in this book.So, this is a really nice book, to get you started with the GNU Toolchain, but don't expect to see all ins and outs in this book of every topics.It's a nice started book, but you also need to buy a specialized book of the topics you want to pay special attention."
5,a melodic and an intelligent written score,"""After the Fair"" is a very melodic and intelligent written score. After one listens to this recording, you will be hooked on the smart,funny and moving lyrics and diologue that Stephen Cole has written that compliments the lush and melodic score composed by Matthew Ward. All the actors are superb in bringing the story to life through their wonderful singing. Michele Pawk especially shines on this recording. Anyone who is interested in hearing the highest caliber of new voices for the American musical theatre only has to listen to this CD to discover that Mr. Cole and Mr. Ward are these new voices."
1,pretty boring,"I found the compositions really boring, weak and uninspired. For me, the melodies sound like some high school pupils trying to do musical. The singers are professionals, though, but nothing more, they lack any spirit. I saw there are people who like this CD, but for me this is a complete time-waster, sorry!"
1,"""In America, they haven't used it for years!""","I've often boasted to my friends that I've never heard a musical I didn't like, and I've listened to well over one hundred of them. Alas, chalk up AFTER THE FAIR as the first, and what a shame it had to be! I could have handled the lack of catchy tunes and contemporary scoring if it weren't for those POSITIVELY DREADFUL AMERICAN ACCENTS of the four leads trying to pass themselves off as British! It's not so much the singing -- that's fine -- it's the dialogue. There's so much of it, and unless you're Meryl Streep, Renee Zellwegger, Gwyneth Paltrow or any other American actor who CAN convincingly adopt a British accent, then there should -- no, MUST -- be a law that forbids any American actor to even ATTEMPT one unless they've undergone a minimum of three solid months of training! In trying to sound like London's working class, Jennifer Piech (as the maid, Anna) channels Frank Spencer from ""Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em"". Ouch, my ears!"
2,What's the fanfare about?,"I am very prejudiced when it comes to musicals. I like them big and brassy. So this little ""Chamber"" musical I found very boring. The plot was very plotty as a straight play should be. But the songs were depth exploring pieces that had forgettable melodies. I was unhappy with this purchase."
4,Great except....,Notice that one speaker has no grill over it. Not a good idea. Yes it will get broken somehow. Great sounding speaker. Top quality.
1,Disappointment,"Within a week of installation the stand, it broke from the hard-glued bottom base of the stand. Thank god, my phone wasn't there. Not a reliable design. Too much of risk for nothing."
1,The only book I would not buy.,Terrible writing and even worse editing. Much better info out there on heart rate monitors!
1,Sally Edward's books are like rolling blackouts!,"Poorly written, poorly edited and confusing--they'll end up like heartzones.com--bankrupt."
5,SMART TRAINING,"This is another great book in a series of great books authored by heart rate guru, Sally Edwards. Co-author Sally Reed has developed some great workouts that prove that working ""through the zones"" is actually the best way to LOSE FAT, and TRAIN SMARTER FOR PEAK PERFORMANCE, and to MAINTAIN CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS. This book is easy to read, easy to follow, easy to APPLY, and comes with a CD-ROM, which can help you log your progress. I bought the Heart Rate Monitor Log Book for Cyclists in addition to this book, and have found it one of the best logbooks on the market as well. Having trouble sticking to your workout or ""breaking through"" some wall? No problem! The Heart Rate Monitor Book for Outdoor and Indoor Cyclists has a world of information available through references to their website. YOU CAN'T LOSE. (And neither will I, unless my fellow age-group competitors read this book, too!)"
3,Mixed bag,"There is definitely some useful information in this book. Since I haven't read any other books on training with an HR, I can't compare, but on it's own merits I would say this book is pretty mediocre. As others have mentioned, it is poorly edited and poorly arranged. Info on the various zones is very good. However there seems to be a whole lot less about how/when to use the various zones, other than very basic ""weight management"" vs. ""fitness"". One last gripe is that nearly all of the outdoor workouts require ""flat to slight rolling"" terrain. Well, if you live someplace that has a lot of hills, forget getting any useful info on how to train in that environment from this book."
5,THIS IS IT for this year's bike training book with heart!,"Everyone knows the best way to get fit is to use your heart. It makes sense to work out using a tool that can measure and improve fitness by ""reading"" this important organ. This book, which is well-written and organized, is especially good for someone who's tentative about getting on a bike or who wants to enjoy cycling while getting the maximum return for output. Simple steps, clear explanations, diagrams paired with workouts for all levels: the authors offer a flexible system for enhancing cycling workouts emphasizing health, fun and self esteem. Can you tell I liked it? Makes a great gift for reluctant couch potatoes who really want exercise but need a little help with a fresh start."
3,"Not bad, not great","I've been looking for a slim/minimal case for my iPhone that fit tightly to the phone. I've purchased several types of cases for my iPhone and my wife's iPhone. Having not found a case that fits tight to the phone, I figured I would try this case too. The case was softer and lighter than most other cases on the market, but it has the same problem as the others I've tried.... just not tight enough. Not a bad case, just a little loose for my taste. I ended up buying the iSkin Revo, which is a much better case. The rubber body is not as thin as I'd like it to be, but it is tight. The Revo also comes with a hard see-through face plate, which I typically don't keep on. The cool thing is the hard face plate is optional and, when not in use, doesn't take away from the functionalty of the case. The only wierd thing about the Revo is it is a lint magnet. But with a quick rub, the lint comes off. That may bother some, but the quality fit overshadows the lint issue in my opinion."
4,Nice Skin,"This is a very nice product, fits perfectly and adds grip to the iphone, however it could fit a little bit tighter, overall I am very happy with it."
2,Road Trippin' Pt 1 = Pile of Stinky Doo Doo,"Don't get me wrong, I love RHCP, but this single is just a steaming pile. The album version is great, its been one of my favourite RHCP songs ever since i got into them in 1999 with their fantastic ""Californication."" But the single is just not worth what you have to pay. Aside from the album version, the live songs are terrible. They sound like old bootlegs that somebody contributed; Anthony's vocals are terrible in these versions. I got a deal on my copy..."
5,Romance,I love this story and I love this version of Persuasion. I could watch this movie multiple times and still not get bored.
5,Mikasa creamer and sugar bowl,we needed to replace these pieces in our set. the new ones were perfect and matched up just fine. Good product. good service. on-time delivery. all good!
4,Give Sputnik a Shot!,"This power pop trio needs to be heard to be appreciated. Nothing in particular about their sound stands out--in fact they've got a fairly typical guitar/bass/percussion thing going on. But it's the way diverse musical styles come together in often unexpected ways that bumps them up a few notches from the average indie band. Some tracks, like ""Hello"" and ""Alienne"" are harmonic & lyrical, seeming to reflect a psychedelic influence; others, like ""New Boots"" and ""Manchild,"" sound like they could've played on 80s college rock stations. The cover of ""Love is All Around"" (theme from the Mary Tyler Moore Show) is pure fun."
1,not the real deal.,"Although I loved the movie, I would encourage no person to purchase this dvd. First of all, the sound quality is absolutely awful. I would expect with a dvd transfer to have dvd quality audio, the technology is there they need to stop cutting corners and finish the job. Further more, if you purchase this particular dvd, you will be purchasing a dvd-R, which is a cheap copy of a dvd. The picture quality is acceptable, but everything else about this supposed dvd is subpar. If you purchase it you will be wasting your money and will surely be dissapointed."
5,What Dummy Tells Tells Us How The Movie Ends????,To the moron who tells us how this movie ends I say: nobody is THAT DUMB!!!!
2,TV pilot film?,A bit hokey for present day. It plays like a made-for-tv pilot film through out. The ending scene where staff and patients walk into their new facility is tailor made for continuing the characters in a television series. I'd be real surprised if that was not someone's purpose.
4,The Supreme Supremes,"Listening to recordings of the original Supremes is a bittersweet trip down memory lane. The vocal talent of background singer Florence Ballard (who died a pauper while Diana Ross went on to become a major entertainer, recording artist, and award-winning actress) is apparent. Flo's soprano voice was distinctive and her absence from the group ended the unique spirit of this fine trio. It's interesting to note that the voices of Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard grew less prominent as the career of Diana Ross was pushed center stage. I don't like re-mastered recordings; I prefer the original versions of songs. I think ""You Can't Hurry Love"" is the finest cut of this collection. The Supremes (and many other Motown recording artists) owe their amazing success to the superb songwriting team of Holland Dozier and Holland."
5,Excellent CD,"They claim that the backing vocals have been brought to the foregroud. Well they must have been totally absent before because except for one song that actually starts with another Supreme singing, this is pretty mostly Diana!I love all this songs because they are great timeless classics. As far as quality recordings I think Diana shines her best in two of her solo recordings (track 17 and 18).I can't wait for the new Motown #1 compilation."
4,The #1's,Great music. Brings back my teen years and all the fun we had dancing to their awesome music. They were the best.
5,I Love this Album,"Get it, it has everything on it, if you are new to Motown this is it, if you grew up with it, this is it. At the price you can't lose. Get this one and the Marvin Gaye one."
5,Great experience,The cd was in excellant condition and the shipping was very fast. I will definitely shop here again.
5,TIPS for Supremes fans and collectors,"BUY THIS CD!!! Remember The Beatles' ""Butcher Cover""?!!!! Maybe ""#1's"" will be reissued with three other Supremes on it!And also, the set of Motown Karaoke cds are SIMPLY THE BEST! You'll hear things you never heard before!!!!!"
1,HORRIBLY REMIXED SOUND,"This CD is flat and boring. Too many classic songs are missing. The Ultimate Collection is the best collection, this is the worst."
3,Why all the hooplah?,"I gave in, went out and bought Diana Ross & The Supremes The No. 1's CD. The cover is nice. The back cover is nice. The 45 sleeve cover photos are also nice. The songs have been remastered, some sound clearer and we hear different endings on some of the songs. What is that sound after ""You Keep Me Hanging On""? But would I recommend this CD to others? NO! Any other CD with these songs would suffice! Did the Supremes with Jean Terrell only have one number 1 hit? It seems like they had more than one. The bonus track is cute, but was it necessary? To Motown/Andy/Etc., please no more CDs with these hits. Please release new stuff!! This would have been a good opportunity for Diana, Mary, Cindy, and Jean to get together to promote the CD. It's a shame that there is so much friction between them! They may have been Supremes on stage but off stage they are not!! Girls, stop the bickering and get together!! Touch!"
1,REMIXED RIPOFF,"The powers that be at Universal Music, apparently not interestedenough to release the Supremes classic individual albums on CD, have come up with yet another ploy to get music fans to partwith their money. ""Hmm.....let's see, most Supremes fans haveall these songs many times over in their collections....I know,let's remix the songs in the guise of giving Mary and Flo theirdue. We'll push their backing vocals up in the mix and say thatthis is how it should have been!"" That's fine, Mary and Flo (andCindy) were talented singers, but there's one small problem. These are NOT what the original hit records sounded like! Getthe Supremes Ultimate Collection for the punchy mono singlesmixes, or the 2-CD Anthology for good stereo sound that stillpreserves the integrity of the originals. What's next? A Wingscollection ""Starring Linda McCartney""?"
3,NICE CD WELL THERE THE SUPREMES !,ITS A CLEAR CD WITH MOST OF THERE SONG'S WHEN SONG WERE SONG'S WELL SO IT GO'S !
3,"Supremes 5, packaging 1","I really enjoyed listening to the hits from 1964-1981 in the order they were released. Usually albums are not arranged that way. I have no issues with the music. Loved it.The packaging is a huge disappointment. The CD is exposed to dust if you leave it in this packaging. The cover has a huge ""1"" punched through it. The sides are open. The depression the CD sits in is styrofoam. Where's the ""eco-friendly""? The yellow CD has the songs listed in a background gold. You can only read it when you tilt the CD so the light reflects just right. I don't know if the regular packaged CD is colored the same, but you should be able to read the tracks.I bought this mostly for its lower price. Won't make that mistake again. I transferred the CD to a ""genuine plastic"" cover. Ha! Ha!"
5,Great!,This CD is a must for anyone who wants to own the best of the Supremes. The Diana Ross solo songs are a bonus.
2,Meh..,"This was fun for a few hours, but it got old pretty quick, it just started to feel very repeatitive, and it doesnt look that great to smash things anyhow cause the free roam world just looked a little cheap, it all looks like a very crisp PsOne game to me. I guess Im not a huge fan of the hulk in particular, his die-hard fans will be totally loving this. It was fun to throw stuff and kick puny humans around, but after I ripped a car apart and made it into smashing gloves for the 20th time, it had all lost it's novelty. I bought it here for $10 in December, and traded it to gamestop for 6 in february. As a bargin bin item it was worth it for awhile, but Im glad I didnt buy it when it was new."
4,AWESOME!,"this game is fantastic! you smash stuff and just destroy cities. The missions is why its 4 stars but they are still good. Just playing around and smashing stuff, I can do that for hours!"
5,An Excellent Record of a Difficult Period of History,"The debate over the rights and wrongs of the use of the atomic bomb on the Japanese populace will go on and on, but this book not only deals with the human aspects but the technical aspects of the creation of this weapon from its' conception until its' use.This is a riviting tale of mankinds most horrible, but effective weapon ever used.There is not a dull page. It WILL hold your interest throughout."
5,"Not a text-book. Factual, yet more exciting than fiction","Stephen Walker's book is an incredible read. It spans the three week period leading up to and immediately following the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima. The depth of research is amazing, yet the story is told with eloquence and is a real page turner. It unfolds in a unique way, giving a moment by moment account of the events and people directly involved, both American and Japanese - more like reading a novel than a piece of history. Maybe it occurred sixty years ago, but the account is written with such immediacy that you feel you are actually there, directly involved."
3,"A good video, but not an attention grabber.","My daughter loves Bear, and especially Tutter. So when we saw this video we though this would be a great way to introduce potty training to her.She watched the video a couple of times, but it did not interest her. She always seemed to be distracted. I like the idea that the video shows kids that this is a normal everyday thing.While this video has not been the perfect tool for us, I would not discourage others from buying it. We have found our daughter prefers to read and that she enjoys reading the book ""Potty Time"" while sitting on her potty."
3,Interesting but Not Appropriate,The DVD is interesting for a short period of time. The story progresses too slowly. My daughter (age 3) became bored. The focus isn't on the potty enough.
4,Good Potty Video - BUT,"My only criticism is that I assumed all of the three episodes would be somewhat related to the potty. Not so, only the first epidsode is potty-related. The last two episodes are fun, but no mention of using the potty. Not sure why they are on the Potty Time video."
4,Great Reinforcement,"Bear and his friends are familiar playmates in our house and this is another fine production. This video does a great job of reinforcing the potty concepts for the newly potty trained. Our toddler has not quite decided she is willing to actually ""go"" on the potty, but thanks to Potty Power she knows and practices all the other steps. We're very happy with the DVD, little one is just not quite there yet."
5,Great for Potty-Motivation,"My potty-resistant 2 year old watched this DVD and the very next time he had to go, he asked to go to the potty. His 5 year old brother also enjoys watching it for the other topics: ""if at first you don't succeed"" and learning to be independent. It is a great evening DVD because it is calming and thought-provoking for the kids. They both ask for it often, along with Kung Fu Panda or the latest semi-violent movie, and do not seem to get bored watching it multiple times."
3,Shadow people are spooky,"My two and a half year old loves bear and tutter and the other characters, but is absolutely terrified of the shadow people. The black cut-out characters on the wildly colored backround are bold, but that's not what's most frightening -- it's the resemblance to Bevis and Butthead some of them have: the evil, nasty smirks. The fact that they jump around on the screen and make crude jerky movements just intesifies the creepy factor. The first time I put the video on I wasn't really watching it with my daughter, and suddenly she was crying hysterically in fear. For weeks she wanted nothing to do with the video, but after awhile she forgot, and now when she watches I stand by, remote in hand, to quickly forward through the scary part. If I don't there are tears. A funny show if you take out the shadow characters."
2,"Words like suave, and debonair to confusing for little ones","I bought this video to try to encourage my son to use the potty. He likes Bear, but this video is way to confusing for a potty learning youngster. With words like words like suave, and debonair, the message is quickly lost for short attention spans. I was very disappointed with this video. ""Two thumbs down"""
3,Its Nice But not for Potty training,"This is a entertaining video, my boys love the singing but that's just about it. Bears dont use the toilet, they dont have on diapers or have to pull down there pants. It may get your children to start thinking about using the potty chair."
4,Introduces the Concept of the Toilet,"Bear and his friends sing and dance to introduce the concept of going to the toilet (or potty). They tell how to know you need to go, and explain that sometimes there are accidents, but that it is worth it to wear underwear instead of diapers. There are some real children who talk about how they love going to the toilet. And a very strange shadow puppet rap showing that people all over the world go to the toilet. Don't know about results yet, but at least it is an entertaining video."
2,"not enough ""potty"" time","This video is cute and it talks about different aspects of the issue, which is good, but it's also the problem - too much talking about it, and not enough demonstration. My son just turned 2, and is in the very early stages of training. He needs to see how to do it, not listen to animals TALK about doing it. Perhaps this video would be good for kids who are further into the process and just need encouragement to continue, but I don't recommend it for beginning training when kids need visual reinforcement for what they see Mom and Dad doing."
3,geared towards older children,"My daughter loves watching Bear and requests this video often, but it is above her in terms of helping her to actually potty train--she's 20 months and I think this would be better for a 3+ year old...."
4,Great video but too many commercials leading into it.,"My grandson watches this video, which is quite a feat in itself - as he usually doesn't watch anything but ""Barney!"" He's only 23 months, so I think it might help him more with his potty training a little later on - - it's already helping a little. The video is excellent in its treatment of the subject. It covers all the aspects - good hygiene, encouraging the child to interrupt his play time when he has to go, what the child should do when he's not at home and has to go, etc. My only negative comment is that there are 10 minutes of commercials for other videos at the beginning of the tape. I think these should be at the end of the tape and then if you want to watch them, you can. When I want 10 minutes of commercials, I'll watch TV."
3,"Entertaining, Not Instructional...","My children are avid watchers of Bear, however, the content of this video was ""beyond the grasp"" of my 22 mos. old daughter...the language was too involved and difficult for her to follow, as far as an instructional tool...she was thoroughly entertained by Bear and all his friends, as always, however, this video did not prove effective as a potty training tool for her...Highly recommend ""Once Upon A Potty: For Her"" Video, though...language is much more simplified and she seemed to grasp the concept immediately, as well as being entertained by the characters, story and songs..."
2,Would have expected better...,"Yes, the characters are nice, as usual, but the main point of this episode is, ""it's OK to go when you feel the urge."" How about pride in achieving control of one's body and in wearing ""big kid underwear,"" not feeling too bad if you have an occasional accident (and learning from accidents), and the other myriad of emotions and achievements involved in potty training? Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Pass!,"My almost 3-year-old twins love movies, but will not watch this boring, somewhat bizarre collection. There are better potty training videos out there. Pass on this one."
3,Not the most useful video for potty training,"The shadow song is very off the wall and very funky. I don't like it and neither does my son. The information that is presented is done very tactfully and done well. I just don't think there is much information presented. Maybe for an older child who is close to being finished with potty training this would be an excellent video, but it just wasn't basic enough for our needs."
1,Not worth a cent,"a waste of money, very hard for a 2 year old to follow, no instruction or guidance at all."
3,Be prepared to fork out a little more than you expect.,"My two year old nephew is now fully potty trained after watching this informative and educational video. The only downside is that he insists on getting kitted out in a ""Bear in the Big Blue House"" costume before he'll go to the toilet. This had led to some unfortunate accidents and a couple of very disgruntled fancy dress shop managers, which, for me, defeats the whole object of the film. Going to the toilet should be a relaxing, stress free experience for a child, not the nightmare of recrimination that follows another soiled, orange furry, ursine outfit. Buy with caution."
1,BIZARRE,This was the most bizarre childrens video I have seen. My daughter looked scared watching it.
2,Beware of the big bear!,"Apparently what some tots find big, affable and friendly others find huge, boisterous and scary. My little video-savvy toddler bursts into tears everytime she sees the bear. We've only been able to play a few seconds of this video before we have to turn it off. We've tried it repeatly but she'll have nothing to do with this character. This is a 0 stars purchase for our house but I gave it 2 stars because anything from Jim Henson has merit. My advise is to make sure your little on is a fan of the Bear before you make the purchase."
2,Backfired in our case,"Our 2 1/2 year son recently took interest in the video *after* being potty trained. Within a few days he started having accidents, which he really didn't have before, even when first learning to use the potty. I finally asked him why he was going in his pants and he said it was because ""Ojo didn't make it to the bathroom"".There is a scene in this video where Ojo the Bear doesn't make it to the bathroom in time and has an accident. For some reason, our son thought this gave him permission to have accidents, probably because Bear says accidents are ok. While this is true, our son took this statement to heart and now I have to work with him all over again. The video is fine except for this scene, as it can easily be misinterpreted by little ones. Bear is very reassuring about accidents, but probably too much so."
1,not helpful at all,"My daughter, who loves baby einstien as well as other cartoons was not even interested in this. I've tried a ton of diffent things from this to singing toilets. What I learned through all of this? She went when she was ready and not when I wanted her to."
5,We love this DVD,This DVD has three episodes that all are wonderful. The songs are really catchy and the stories/characters are sweet and delightful. Highly recommended.
3,Not really aimed at very young children,"I watched this video with my 2 two year old boys and it did absolutely nothing for them. We even watched it several times in hopes maybe they would start to like it. The language was well above them and they lost interest very quickly. It is not really about becomming potty trained, and so my children just really looked confused. This movie is not bad, it just would be better for a child that is 3 or 4 and already potty trained but still having trouble with accidents as one of the characters almost has one and the other actually does. In fact, we let my 5 yr. old watch it because she still has trouble telling when to stop her activities to go potty. It was great for that."
5,Bear is a great potty teacher,"I own a home daycare and purchased the DVD. My 2 year old's love the DVD, they watch it over and over! I already am seeing improvement in their potty training. And I can use Bear as an example now. He's great!"
4,Young Two- Year Old Loves This!,"I bought this for my 26-month old grandson. He loves to watch this ! He asks to see it, I think because of the bear. I can tell he is not ready to put on the potty, but this is a delightful introduction for a young child. He is becoming aware, thanks to this DVD."
2,Lack of information,I bought this video when my son is 18 months old. I was very disappointed because it doesn't really mention what is potty or anything about potty training. I think it only good for kids who already know everything and need review or a friendly reminder.
2,It doesn't work for my 2 year old!,"I think it didn't very helpful with my 2 year old boy's potty training. I agree with the customer from Austin, TX that ""it doesn't really mention what is potty or anything about potty training"". My boy just watching the bear singing talking and the mouse sitting on the potty for a while. But he still didn't understand that he needed to sit on his potty to make bowel movement. It was ""Once Upon a Potty"" book that really helped him to do so."
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR POTTY TRAINING!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this dvd for my 24month old son. I've been potty training him since he was 18m with great success but he had a backslide, having accidents about 4x a week. Now, he grabs himself and says POTTY and runs to the bathroom. Before he was using a potty chair, now he only uses the toilet (I think because he saw Tutter using the toilet). Aside from the potty training he loves the singing and he loves all of the animals on the show. I also recommend Bear in the Big Blue House: Colors and Shapes. These dvd's are so cute my little one watches them every day!"
3,"Not that motivating, but cute","My daughter, 2 1/2 doesn't want to watch it very often. I think it's cute, but it just doesn't seem to motivate my kid. My 1st choice in movies is ""Potty Power"". It's been pretty effective. Maybe this will work better for you, if your kid really loves Bear in the Big Blue House."
5,Potty time perfection....,"I had been coaxing my daughter to use the potty consistently for some months, when Dad spotted this and we ordered it. ( Trust me, you may get to that point too..you will seek out anything!) We had tried books, rewards, etc...and it wasn't getting the results we wanted. Honestly, after a few times of watching Bear in the Big Blue House sing and talk about the potty, our daughter responded! I cannot take the credit for knowing how it worked..I just know that it worked! Also, once she accomplished the ""potty hurdle"", she did not want to watch the DVD again, so we sent it to our nephew. We were very pleased with the results, and would highly recommend it."
5,My daughter loves it,"She looks at this all the time. Although i had her potty trained by time the dvd was delivered, it is a good reinforcement, and she loves the music on the dvd"
4,Entertaining - but my toddler is not motivated to potty yet,"My son (2 1/2 years old) loves Bear. So, this was a pertect video for him. He is just not interested in potting and this video has not helped to improve his interest. He will potty sometimes when I put him on the potty, and he is proud when he actually goes. He usually asks to go potty after he gone in his pants and refuses to go on the potty when I know that he needs to go. He has been watching the video for about 3 months now - and I will keep trying. One day I know that he will be ready!"
3,"Warm, Fuzzy, Vague","Like all things from ""Bear in the Big Blue House,"" this video is very pleasant and well produced. But it hasn't interested my 23 month old, who is otherwise a fan of BBBH. It lacks the specific, dare I say graphic, information that my son finds so interesting in an animated video on the same topic. I'd say this tape is more about the concept of toilet training than it is about the fundamentals of actually using the thing."
2,Not interesting - it doeen't really show how to use the potty,"I thought this video was really going to encourage my toddler to use his potty but it didn't. This video has good songs and characters but it only has two short scenes where a puppet is using the potty. I was expecting a scene where the child can be taken step by step on how to use the potty. this video didn't do it, so I'm still in the search of a video that really enphasizes potty trainning. Todlers need visuals and actions, the bear on this video does more talking than actual actions."
4,Good DVD,"This is a good DVD, but my son didn't connect with it. My niece however loved it!! Great one to try."
2,My child was not interested,My son is 2.5 and he was not interested in watching this at all. Thank goodness I have another son who may get some use out of it! It was a recommended video but it just did not work for us.
3,Not Great For Potty Training.....,"My kids have the Bear books, but we have never watched the videos before. It has some good things in it, cute, but still does not get a 28 month old interested in sitting on the potty. Probably more for an older child, over 3? I have read some of the other reviews and seems to be for more older kid. This one was kind of boring."
2,"cute, but doesn't really teach anything","It's cute, I suppose, and useful to introduce your toddler to the concept of the potty and the fact that everyone uses it, but beyond that, it just really isn't all that helpful to the potty training process.It's a useful door-opener perhaps to parents who may be too uptight to broach the subject to their toddler, but that's about it."
3,"We LOVE Bear, but this wasn't what I expected","I thought a Bear video would be excellent to help my daughter begin to learn about the potty. I expected some sort of instructional type video I guess; this was just another episode from the regular tv series and as I recall there is only one show. Usually the videos have two shows. The ""Shadow"" story has a funk song ""Potty, yea, yea, yea, potty"" It is difficult to even tell that the word they are singing is ""potty"", and sounds more like ""party"". My daughter, now 28 months, is potty trained, but this video did not help at all in my opinion."
3,Part of video scares 3 yr old,"This video has a lot of great songs and situations, but the dancing shadow people litterally scare my 3 yr old! We cant run the tape any more because she cries."
3,Bear in the Big Blue House - Potty Time with Bear,"My son is 18m and very active i bought this dvd it has got 3 episodes but potty training scence are only in 1 episode and only two scence,my son even dont like watching it."
2,Good video undermined by racist stereotyping,"Like a lot of the Bear videos, this has great scripting, catchy tunes and good puppeteering. However, the big let down for me was the song introduced by Shadow, who is an annoying representation of a bog-Oirish charachter complete with inane diddly-eiddly fiddle music. The song is quite disgraceful really - cut-out figures supposed to be blacks in 1970s disco attire, complete with frizzy Afro hairstyles, thick lips and wide noses. At best you might say it's racist stereotyping, at worst downright insulting to African-Americans who might buy this video. Come on, Muppet People, you can do better than that!"
5,Cute Video,"This is the best potty video I've seen. My two year old loves the part when bear puts his nose right up to the screen of the t.v. and sniffs, she laughs, its sooo cute. Very well done.The little animals are all so adorable. I;m so pleased I purchased this video."
3,Not focused on the potty enough,"Considering the title of this DVD, I was expecting to view shows that were focused on using the potty. The first show featured on this DVD addresses issues like going potty even if you're in the middle of a fun game, accidents sometimes happen even if you're trying to get to the potty really fast or when you're sleeping, etc. This is all great, but the next two episodes don't relate to the potty at all - at least not if you're a two-year-old!I do think this show is very cute. My son likes ""Bear and the Big Blue House"" in general, but this was not very motivating with potty issues. If you're looking for a real potty-training aid, I highly recommend ""Potty Power."""
4,Potty Time With Bear is Great!,"I purchased this DVD last September when my daughter was 2 1/2and we were ready to start the potty training process. She loves it! My husband and I thought it was fun, too. Unlike another viewer, we also enjoyed ""Shadow""'s segment.My daughter now calls toilets everywhere ""potty chairs"", which I think is cute. We also bought the Bear in the Big Blue House ""Going Potty"" book, which she keeps in the bathroom near her potty chair.Did this help with the actual potty training? Probably not, as we still don't have it together yet, but are farther along than when we started. I'm not really pushing the issue until she turns 3 next month (advice from ""The Girlfriend's Guide to Toddlers"").Thus far, this is the only potty training DVD we have purchased, so I can't compare to others, but we really do have a good time looking at this one."
3,Buy the DVD,"The VHS video comes with only one episode for close to $10. For almost $13, the DVD has 3 episodes. I learned the hardway. My daughter loves bear and enjoys watching this video but I should have bought the DVD to get more bang for my buck."
3,Disappointed...,"I added this to my son's giftlist after seeing all the positive reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, when the video arrived, I was disappointed.Because the characters do not wear diapers to start with, there was no connection for moving from diapers into underpants. Everyone's naked all the time, LOL!There was one example of a character's baby pictures showing him in diapers, but in reality you can barely see the diaper. My son was confused and asked me to show him where the diaper was located. (Weird!)The ""Potty, potty!"" song sounds just like ""Party, party!"" so my son asked about a party. (""Birthday party?"")When the accident happened in the episode, I was disappointed that a little urine wasn't shown on the floor - because my son is very literal, so he had no idea what was going on.The potty episode is one of the three on the DVD. The other two have nothing to do with potty training."
4,An excellent companion,"I came quite close to giving this book a five star rating as there are some terrific essays included, most notably by Holly Markland Harder, Edward J. Hughes, David Ellison and Malcolm Bowie.However, there are a few, as can be expected in this type of book, that suffer from an overload of academia. The novel is easier to read and understand than some of these essays.The book has the perfect title though as it is an exceptional companion to the understanding and enjoyment of A la recherche du temps perdu."
4,Good book for the beginners,"I started reading this book, with little knowledge of XML. After finishing, I become confident in basic XML concepts.Examples are IE5 oriented, it has to be since it is a Microsoft publication. The definitions and rules are repeated now and then, which makes the reader impatient.But the bottomline, good book for beginners!!!!"
4,The Best XML Book So Far,"The book has been very clearly organized and eases you in to XML. Having had prior website building experience some of the concepts discussed were review, but will help inexperienced users. One down-side to the book is its focus on MS Inernet Explorer only. Big surprise considering it is a MS Press book, but they could be courteous enough to mention how well their methods will translate to other browsers. Small issue really... overall the book is very well written and laid out. Another complaint is the lack of reference material in the appendix. A quick reference and style and syntax reference would be nice as well."
5,Step by Step XML Excellent Book!,"I purchased this book in hopes it would clear some things up as I took XML as a college crash class. This is an excellent starting point for those wanting to learn XML or anyone needing more explanation. The terms and procedures are explained so that you understand how and what with out going into a lot of theory. The examples are wonderful,and unlike some books, so far all the code works. It is easy to understand and it makes sense and doesn't leaving you wondering what was just said.I give this book a thumbs up!"
4,great coverage of client size xml transforms,"I used this book in 2001 to learn XML and it was great then.In the last week I have been looking at transforming xml on the client. A lot of designs transform on the server, but I really wanted to investigate a full xml approach. This shows you how to take an xml feed and use a client generated file ( XSLT or HTML ) to transform that data into a dynamic web page. Unfortunately this only works on IE, but the book explains how to do this easily."
4,easy read,"As a windows developer who is very much into windows dna, I thought I'd pick up on XML. Welp, like the book says, its a book for the beginners, and it really is. I was a bit disappointed to find out that the book was written for non-programmers. However, it was a great way to get started on xml, real fast.The only thing I didn't like about this book is that its very redundent. A lot of the sentences are repeated over and over for clarity, but in my opinion, it had one too many of those, especially considering that it's a technical book."
2,very basic,"i understand that this book is supposed to be very basic, but you don't need 380 pages to cover the basics! it is too general without any depth...if the price was [cheaper], then it could be justified, but at...(retail) -- not worth it...another anoyance is that each chapter contains several references that say, ""(enter topic) will be discussed in chapter (enter chapter number)"" ANOYING!"
3,Baby Steps,"This book is very much a beginner's guide to XML. I went into this book with a very rudimentary understanding of what XML is, and found it to be a good start-off point. The writing style is simple and straightforward. All the samples are included on the CD, but I found that by typing them in by hand instead, I understood the sections better. Plus, I could change some things and gain even more understanding.The book explains what XML is, some examples of applications that use XML, and how to display XML data via Cascading Stylesheets, databinding, the Document Object Model, and XSL stylesheets.As a programmer, I would like to have seen the book tell more about the creation of XML documents from sources other than notepad (i.e. : programmatically) for use in places other than IE ,or at the minimum, have it point at some other resources for this information.Finally, the book doesn't really wind down - it just stops cold.Overall, a good primer."
2,Step by Step - For the vertically challenged,"The book introduces the subject of XML quite well, but for me it took far too long to say it. Why say it a sentence if you can use a paragraph? Why print a listing once if you can print it several times?It is certainly a step by step guide - for the vertically challenged"
5,Love her music,"I love Miri's music so much. It's such a fusion of different genres. I think my generation and younger can really listen to this. It's not like your ""classic"" classical music (if that makes any sense)."
2,Fitting was horrible!!!!,"I know why this is not on a model. I bought this cape for my 9 year old for Halloween. The neck was so tight; it strangled her when she had it on. I even had a problem with the fit, as an adult. When I pulled on the back to stretch the material, it ripped! I ended up cutting material off the back in order for it to fit comfortably. I had to do my own sewing to fix the back. I would not recommend spending 29.00 + dollars on this item. I was very disappointed."
2,INCOMPLETE BOOK,"I KNEW THE AUTHOR AND HAD PERUSED HIS COPY OF THE BOOK YEARS AGO. THIS VERSION IS COMPLETELY DEVOID OF THE WONDERFUL PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION,"
1,Do not recommend,I wanted a book that would provide a high level of overall understanding of SW quickly. I am new to SW. I've been teaching AutoCAD for over 4 years. I purchased this book with an understanding of the Dummy series. I was very disappointed with the lack of information for the new user. It seems that the book is targeted towards a user which has a basic understanding of the Software and that needs to understand the changes between the last version and now. I was not amused or informed.
1,Waste of money,This book is written by the Solidworks Customer Satisfaction Manager.He rehashes the same stuff as in the Solidworks Essentials manual that comes with the software.I found it virtually useless.I was seeking a different viewpoint in the hopes of gaining a better grasp of the many vague issues in the manual.
1,I paid [...] for an infomercial,"I love the dummies series, so I was greatly dissapointed by this book. I needed a solidworks tutorial because I found the help files and ""basic"" tutorials that come with solidworks to be too advanced. When this book is not tooting its own horn on how great solidworks is, then it is way too technical for the beginner. I am a designer, not an engineer. I am hired for the look of a product, not for how it is molded. This book assumes too much. I had to look up chamfer and fillet on Wikipedia, as this books skips the basics and launches into a thou-shalt-sketch-like-this. (again, I am NOT AN ENGINEER) I understand that engineers out there would find this book too basic because it takes half the book outlining anal-retentive ways of structuring workload before launching into actually making anything. [...]."
3,Decent overview but light on examples,"I am an experienced SolidWorks user who was looking for supplemental information to build my knowledge base and help me transition from SW 2005 to SW 2006. This manual is a decent general reference but it lacks any detailed examples and the CD that comes with it is mostly SW promotional stuff. I bought it because of the low price ($20) Also, there is no information on advanced features such as surface modeling"
2,Rather disappointed,"I bought this book hoping to learn some little known shortcuts, secrets, etc., but all I got from the book was a different writing of the help file.This might be a great book for someone just starting out."
1,Missing the good stuff,"In the hopes of shortcutting my learning process I bought this book, having found other ""...for Dummies"" books pretty good. The problems with this book include:1. Many of the step-by-step examples are too generic to be really useful. Instead of dealing with specific items (such as types of mates) the book covers ALL mates in a broad stroke. Not really useful.2. Major items are completely missing from the book. Things like equations, and how to link dimensions. There isn't even material about the shortcut menu, if you don't believe me look for ""shortcut"" in the index. Not there.I am finding much better material on-line and free. Don't waste your money on this book, but if you do, don't pay full list for it as I did."
2,"Good Cartoons, but!!!","I bought the book based on the price and past history with the Dummies series. I was very disappointed with the lack of orderly information for a new user. This Dummy series is not for dummies, it is for people that has an existing knowledge of SW and does not need a book, but enjoys reading cartoons with clever sayings."
2,SolidWorks for Dummies,Not what I want or need. This is more of an explanation of what S/W is & what it contains. It is NOT an instruction manual of how to learn it. I want a teaching guide. Something that will tell me where the tools are to do the tasks I need. I'm an old hand using CAD - over 35 yrs - now I've been directed to use S/W and must learn it quickly.
4,Good explanation of the CAD tool,"The used book seller shipped promptly (at least made paying the big $$$$ for fast delivery worthwhile). The book is pretty good. I'm an experienced CAD pilot on Pro/E, Unigraphics, and Intergraph. I'm looking at changing jobs, and may need to know something about SolidWorks. This book told me what I needed to know - that the basic concepts of the software are pretty much similar - things in different places on the menus. The explanations are very easy to follow. The only downside is that as versions change from year to year, books like this tend to go out of date fairly quickly (how much depends on how extensive the changes are in the software)."
3,Perfect for beginners but not for novices and experts,"Web Site Design Goodies is a pefect book for beginners but not for novices and experts. Some of the pros of this book is that it contains many critiques (not reviews - it offers as much advice for imporvement rather than just ridicule) of websites and lists some of the common mistakes beginners make. I also found his chapters on site identification and promotion quite useful. Some of the cons on the otherhand is that it does not cover advanced topics such as transparent gif tricks, complex tables, etc, and that the author repeats himself on certain subjects far too many times. Bottom line: get it if you are a beginner, don't get it if you are anything more than that."
5,Great!! (of course)...,"...it's JPK, isn't it?JPK is the MAN...His music is that down-home-hug-your-Grandma music!! When I need a spiritual uplift, he's one of the first CD's I pick up."
2,"This book could have been great, but.......","I odered this book with high hopes. The premise is wonderful. The left page lists a conformational aspect and information about it. The right page is supposed to have photos illustrating that fault. This is where the book falls apart, most of the photos are so small that they don't illustrate anything. Some of them are just pretty pictures that make no attempt to do anything but decorate the page. A single GOOD photo of each fault is expected, but not delivered. To make matters worse, the author doesn't seem to distinguish between highly prized breed characteristics, like jibbahs, and faults! Someone should take this idea and do it right."
3,"Should be titled ""Conformation for the beginner/novice"".","If you are expecting the full range for each conformational defect, then you need to go elsewhere. The one photograph provided for each flaw was of excellent quality, but the performance photographs were repetitive. Pictures of the ideal conformation, or a range from good to bad, would have been more informative. The sections on performance consequences were good, as well as the descriptions."
2,A very general look at conformation,"I was disappointed with the level of detail included in this book. For the various conformation flaws, there was generally only one picuture of the flaw, followed by pictures of the activity(ies) that the horse could or could not perform if he had the flaw.I would have hoped for a more detailed discussion and photos showing various degrees of deviation from ideal."
3,Actually I enjoyed the book - Not 4 stars but CLOSE.,"I agree it needed more detail. BUT, I think it makes a great quick reference. If fact, it would of been better to shrink down the size of the book to make it easier to pack around. It makes a nice gift for the beginner and average horseperson. If you are into breeding and buying, it is helpful - but you might want more detail. I like the suggested exercise to help improve horse performance - but it could of been expanded on. I do NOT regret buying it. Everyone that has borrowed the book - ask where did I get it and they enjoyed it."
2,"Great premise, but filled with unhelpful photos","I love the concept and format of the book, but it could be so much better.As another reviewer noted, the photos do very little to help a reader evaluate the various conformational aspects/faults in actual horses. Each page usually has just one small photo of a ""naked"" horse with the conformation described, and a bunch of small action shots of horses at work under saddle or in harness. I would have much preferred four or five good shots of different types of horses clearly demonstrating the conformation in question.The writing is informative, but a bit sparse and clinical.I'm giving it two stars rather than three because of the hefty price tag of $39.95. It's a beautiful book, but all in all disappointing."
3,"Overall, A Big Disappointment","Some intersting new zombie behavior (like attacking each other and sleeping). Other than that, not much of interest here. Kept waiting for the ""smarter and faster"" zombies to arrive, they finally DO in the final cpl minutes of the film and there was no real chance to see how they really behaved other than attacking anything that moved."
3,Pretty Good,"I watch this movie the other night and thought it was rather good for a low budget film. I was really suprised I gave it 3 starts because it wasn't the walking dead or resident evil ,but it was good enough to watch again . Watch you want be disappointed !"
3,"Not bad, not great. Totally watchable.","Maybe its just because I've watched so many terrible zombie movies that were made with more money and less love, but I thought this was kind of okay. It could have been better, yes. But it was enjoyable. There were a few moments that made no sense, but there were also a few moments where i cringed, and a few moments where i unexpectedly laughed my butt off at something that was SUPPOSED to be entertaining. SO i call that a win in this genre. I believe that this movie is a good example on the positive influence the success of ""The Walking Dead"" TV show is having on networks and studios throwing a couple dimes behind a director with a bit of vision. Now... if they could just start throwing them at BETTER directors with MORE time to work .."
1,flimsy product and support,"A mouse button broke on this machine after only a couple months of extremely light use. That wouldn't have been so bad -- things break -- but then the company refused to ship a replacement part to Hawaii, where I live. The response I got from tech support is that ""We aren't able to ship parts to Hawaii."" Honest -- they agreed only to send it to my mother, on the Mainland, who then forwarded it to me. So evidently HP engineers aren't quite equal to the task of picking up a phone and calling UPS. Maybe they should hire my mom."
5,"Very different, not for everyone, but FANTASTIC!","This film may too wierd for everyone's tastes, but I thought it was fantastic. The cast was very good and the humor kept me smiling and laughing out loud. The love scene definitely leaves you with something to think about!"
2,Come on Casper?,"O.K. Obviously a low budget jobbie, with little thought to a plot. The movie is a tossed salad of actors and actresses making a mess of their lines. I bought it on a whim...Sorry I did."
1,SOOOOO bad,"This movie is a total waste of time (and money)! I watch a lot of vampire movies, and let's face it, they are not high-budget productions and unless they have something to do with Anne Rice, they don't draw in the best actors, either. Nevertheless, many vampire movies have SOME merit for the fans. Not this one. I cannot honestly find any redeeming qualities for this piece of flatulence."
1,Forget It!,Appalling by any standards. Is Van Diehn on a career suicide mission because I can't decide if he's worse in this or his 'Tarzan and the Lost City' effort. Awful.
1,"Ugh, Eew, Ridiculous, Dull, As If","There aren't enough words for me to say 'Do not buy this piece of cowhide. It doesn't even deserve the 1 star I gave, let alone a recommendation! I'd say more but this is a public post."
1,Just watch Buffy.,"This movie tries to be hip, but merely comes off as annoying. The acting is average and the characters are bland. The worst of the ensemble is Rod Steiger as the vampire hunter. Sometime during the 70's he forgot how to act and now merely screams his lines. The film has some good ideas, like Steiger's hip hop assistant, but they are squashed under the weight of a poor script. With so many good vampire movies out there don't waste your time with this stiff."
1,JUST SAY NO!!!!!,"I cant NOT recommend this enough. This is without a doubt the worst film in the history of horror movies, well movies all together. The movie has a plot that falls apart in the first 30 seconds, and from there on its torture.I would recommend that anyone whos curious about this movie, let me put it this way - I would rather bang my head against a wall for a few days then to sit through another minute of this movie!"
3,Funny,"About a vamp that is a trouble maker and picks up another one that he made and tries t stop the Dracula himself. Lots of boobs but that's it swearing too, but that's normal."
3,Campy fun,"Dracula is in modern day Los Angeles and is trying to control all the vampires living in the city. Campy fun with not much of a plot. It's funny to listen to the actors try to talk with their fake vampire fangs on. They all come across as lispy and ridiculous, although I'm not sure that was the intention. Good for a laugh."
1,Pretty Bad..but funny,"The only reason why I'm rating this movie is because of Steiger'sperformance. Anytime he was onscreen I was on the floor laughing.I have no idea how he did his scenes with a straight face.The black gang banger stereotypes pretty much put the ""nail in the coffin"" on how I feel about the movie as a whole, its crap.Flex you are a talented comedic actor, but c'mon now.."
1,Woof Woof,As a lover of B movies from way back....This movie was really bad not even humerous just bad acting and bad scripting with bad filming....What a waste....
3,"So-So film, funny in spots...","..But incredibly gory in others. Plus, unlike Buffy, there really is no protagonist. Who do you root for? The gang-bangers, the murderous vampires or the Nazi vampire hunter? I must admit that parts of the film had me laughing at times."
5,Recommended by College Parents of America,"""This insightful and essential guide to mastering the politics of corporate America should be required reading for every college graduate. Ms. Levit's real-world anecodotes and advice can help those who are new to the job market (or those who have been foundering in it) achieve success and avoid costly career mistakes.""James A. Boyle, PresidentCollege Parents of America"
3,They Don'tTeach Corporate in College,"I wish I had the benefit of this book when I graduated from college nearly 30 years ago. I felt the same struggle between what the business world expects and my authentic self. I chose the latter trying to save the world and the financial rewards that my peers received by playing the game essentially passed me by. If you want to succeed in this dog eat dog world and get to the top, then this is your book. I gave to a neighbor who just turned 25 and wants to make money. But the rub is how much do you sacrifice of your real self to make it in the business world."
4,interesting read,this book was recommended to me by one of my mentors at my company. i wish i would have gotten this book BEFORE i started my first corporate job. lots of really interesting information and advice. great read for a soon-to-graduate or recent college grad.
1,Don't waste your time,Anyone who has had a decent internship or some work experience or a lot of common sense will already know what is in this book.
1,Irritating to the ears,"I thought that it should be something that could not be heard by humans but argh, its more of a human repellent than insect repellent :("
4,It works!,"I wish Amazon would sell this product again. It really does work. You can hear a faint high pitched sound coming from it. Not that noticeable unless you are in a small space like a car, or if you drop it too many times. The keychain part breaks fast. Unless you replace it with something stronger and just use the clip, it will fall off your belt or pants. So try not to drop it or the sound gets a little higher. I'm dropped it many times, but it still works."
3,Better Than I Originally Thought,"The first time I did this workout I was a little underwhelmed. It was fairly easy, the music was somewhat annoying and the cueing was not always great. However, I have continued to use it in my rotation of workout DVDs and it has grown on me. It is short and basic, so its good for a naptime workout. This workout won't get you into great shape all on its own, but it has some very good points. The abdominal workout is really good, as is the kickboxing section and the squats/ plies. Overall, this is a decent, basic, easy workout."
5,Quick and Fun Total Body Workout,"I love this workout because it is fast-paced but easy to follow. Sometimes I don't have a full hour to dedicate to exercising. In a half hour, I can work all areas of my body, get my heart pumping and feel great. The beach in the background is also nice."
5,Excellent,"Add to this an SDS 3 jaw drill chuck adaptor, and you have a very versatile and powerful tool to tackle many tasks"
3,4th Edition Codex,"The latest rulebook for Warhammer 40K is 5th Edition released in 2008. This Necron Codex was written for the older 4th Edition rules and not 5th Edition. There is currently(December 2009) NO 5th Edition Codex available. If you must buy a Necron Codex now, this is the newest to get. The rumor is 2010 for the 5th Edition Necron codex release.**Personal Opinion**I don't think there is much debate over Necron's being the most negatively affected by 5th Edition rules so the fact that Necron's still don't have an updated 5th Edition Codex is unfortunate."
4,Ferrari Enzo,It was challenging for me but fun at the same time. I had to go out and buy glue and paint so it took quite awhile to finish. But it was a good product.. and fast shipping!
4,"Difficult, but a beautiful model in the end","Don't let the price fool you, this kit is very detailed, has quite a few parts, and builds into a great car when finished. Not that it's easy! It will try your patience for sure. But it's worth every dime. It says 10 minuted build time above ! LOL I don't think so. :-)Take your time. Both Tamiya and Testors make Italian Red paint, either will do, but you can really paint it any color you want to."
4,Great Kit!!,"When I bought this kit, I was very pleased with it. The parts are molded in white and chrome and they are pretty realistic. The paint list for kit is: Aluminum, Flat Red, Gloss Red, Semi-Gloss Black, Silver, Satin Red, Transparent Red. BUT there is one paint they don't tell you about: Flat Black. (For seatbelts) This is a pretty nice kit. Revell is ALMOST just as nice as Tamiya. Buy the Revell kit for $15-$25 instead of $50-60 for Tamiya. It came very fast!(I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS MODEL FOR BEGINNERS!)"
1,Wrong Colour etc.,"I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT ON SEPTEMBER AND SHIPPED IT TO THE U.S.A. BY THE TIME I VISITED USA IN EARLY DECEMBER 2012, I REALIZED THEY SENT ME WHITE INSTEAD OF RED, AS ADVERTISED. I FEEL MISLEAD BY THIS ADVERTISEMENT AND I'M SURE IT WILL CATCH A LOT MORE. I ORDERED RED TO PUT AMONGST VARIOUS COLOURS AND IF I KNEW THEN WHAT I KNOW NOW, I'D NEVER HAVE PURCHASED THIS. THIS IS NOT MY FIRST TIME ASSEMBLING CARS BUT THE PARTS ON THIS ONE JUST FALLS APART AND IT IS PAINSTAKING. I WILL NEED GLUE IF I DECIDED TO ASSEMBLE. I FEEL CHEATED AND MY MONEY WASTED. I WOULD LIKE A RETURN OF MY MONEY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AS THIS IS COSTING ME MORE THAN I EXPECTED. THANKS IN ADVANCE."
4,Good Product!,"Got for my 5yr old daughter whos almost 6, but i would actually recommend this product for a 7+yr old cause my daughter somewhat lost interest pretty fast. Many small pieces to contend with & keep track of, so be careful. Hair accesories dont like to stay in. the worst has to be for the adult and be warned due to its packed so good with ties/tape/plastic/string/bands/etc etc that it almost takes you till the new years to open the dang thing! other than that, no major complaints, thank you."
4,Divas Sing The Dirty Blues,"I thought this was a great CD, especially when I picked it up at FYE for $4.98 plus tax. That's hard to beat. I like the Dirty Blues and this CD had 25 assorted songs by a variety of old time blues divas. I would definitely recommend this CD."
4,Sin Fronteras,"Outstanding! This album has something for everyone. Whether you're a music novice or professional you'll enjoy Ashanti. The tight horn section melds perfectly with the driving rhythm section. The variety of songs features everyone perfectly. That says something for an album with all original material. Well done, Ashanti!"
5,Love it,I know these are old songs but sounds geat. Received on date expected and it was packaged to protect it. Really have enjoyed listening to such good mucis
5,husband likes the taste,My husband is very pleased with this product. He enjoys the taste. This is the only Selenium I buys for him and it is made by Nature Made.ThanksRosie
3,Cute ideas but not visually exciting,"I needed a book of ideas to keep my 20 month old toddler busy, especially during the winter months. It had some cute ideas, but was printed in black and white on grayish paper and was not visually exciting to me. Still, it gave me some good ideas but a lot of them I could have come up with on my own!"
4,Seems to be working fine,"This collar has been on my cat for a couple of weeks now and all seems to be well. No fleas, no ticks, no scratching,and no skin irritation. All seeems to be well. I got this one because of the break-away snap, which for me is a good idea. My cat is very active and I didn't want the collar to be something that caused him to get stuck on something. It's still on him and he's still fine so it seems to be good."
2,Not too efective,I purchased this for my two year Labrador female. I live along the western coast of India... where probably the humidity got a better of the effectiveness of the tape. It didnt cause any discomfort or rash to my Lab.... but I guess something was amiss and I didnt get the resistance to ticks that I was hoping for.
1,poor-man's 60's goth......yuck!,"Wow! I listened to this collection of a group once described to me as ""like Black Sabbath"" with much anticipation,only to think ""what is this garbage!""! Unfortunately, I now own this box set of songs I won't be listening to again! This has the dark lyrics but with 60's love child music around it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but 60s/70s collectors looking for something different."
5,"Boy, Did They Ever Fall From Grace!!!!","This is an excellent movie starring Kevin Spacey and Bernadette Peters as Jim and Tammy Bakker.Boy,did they ever fall from grace,hopefully it will be released on DVD in the near future!!!"
4,birchwood by john banville,"Thoroughly enjoyed book. dig a little deeper, think a bit harder. beautiful prose, poignant symbolism viewed from a younger perspective with some dark humour thrown in. john banville sings to you."
1,"Boring, boring, boring...","This is an astoundingly boring novel. As I recall, on the sleeve, it announced itself as a ""black comedy"".Those fateful words led me to suspect that the book would be more ""black"" than comic. And indeed it was, in a sense - there isn't any colour in this book; nothing to rescue you from the murky, self-indulgent metaphors; the impenetrable, wordy thickets Banville has lovingly constructed in a transparent attempt to create capital-A Art.Combine that with an incredibly dreary and pessimistic storyline, and you have a novel which abounds in intense boringness.So, yeah. Don't buy it, unless you're also a pretentious, boring poser like John Banville."
1,Product doesnt work for flea problem.,"Hartz Flea and Tick Shampoo in 12 oz, doesnt kill fleas like it says it will. Yes it will clean your cat, make it smell nice, give it a shiny coat but kill fleas? Not so much.I had noticed some fleas on my indoor cat, we do not use regular flea killing products likeAdvantage Once-A-Month Topical Flea Treatment for Cats Over 9 Lbs (6 Applications)Because we rarely ever need to. So I bought this shampoo and used it and it didnt kill one of them, I even looked in the tub after I did it to check! no floating corpses. So I waited and waited a few days, remember this stuff is supposed to last awhile and keep killing the biting pests! It didnt.I guess I will have to break down and get the expensive stuff!"
4,A very entertaining book with excellent pictures,"This book consists of two parts. The first part gives general information about the history and development of the fountain part, plus its side-effects (FP advertising, FP's in arts, influence of FP's on regular life). The second part gives information on 100 pens from the last 100 years. Apart from the excellent photographs, it is very interesting that a lot of Italian/European pens are covered. There are a few inconsistencies in the text, but overall a lot of useful info is given about the covered pens.It is not a reference book, because of the choices and number of pens covered. However, it is a very beautiful and entertaining book that is very well worth reading. You could even spend an evening just dreaming away with the pictures ..."
1,EGGS STICK TO PAN,READ ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS AND PURCHASED THIS ITEM THINKING THAT THE OVER EASY EGGS I HAVE IN THE AM WON'T STICK EVEN WITHOUT GREASEWAS I WRONG!! EGGS STUCK LIKE GLUE TO PAN!! I WILL NEVER USE IT AGAIN.
1,"I consider the advertising for this item a scam. Note the number 2 in the listing, which reads as follows: ""Circulon 2 8-Inch.","Look at the description...""Circulon 2 8-Inch Open French Skillet"", which clearly suggests there are two skillets for sale. But when my shipment arrived, there was only one skillet. I called the company, and was told cheerily, ""Yes, lots of people are confused by that."" Well, I guess so! Now that the company knows about the confusion, why do they continue to list it in this ""confusing"" way? Additionally, why does Amazon permit them to go on doing so?"
5,So good I bought two!,"This is a great little pot - good quality, heavy-duty, and useful in a number of kitchen situations. I use it for sauces quite a bit. My mom loved mine so much that I got one for her most recent birthday - she gets a lot of use out of hers as well."
4,WEDDING GIFT,I sent this as a wedding present and the Bride and Groom loved it. They were registered at Macy's but I got it cheaper and faster at Amazon.
5,Wow,"Alcatraz Merry-Go-Round is a great sequel to Rock Hard. After the surprising epilogue in Rock Hard I felt like Whitey left us hanging, but this books picks up right were Rock Hard left off. To anyone who thought Rock Hard was a good book, you should without a doubt read Alcatraz Merry-Go-Round."
3,"Nice Glasses, bad shipping","The product itself is beautiful. The glasses are very nice quality. I ordered two boxes, and each box contained one broken glass :( I blame the packaging/shipping. Be cautious."
5,A must for hospice personnel,"As a hospice worker, I have carried this book with me since it was released. I also recommend it to all new hospice volunteers, it is essential information and a great companion book to ""Sacred Dying""."
3,GOOD BUT PATCHY,"There are a number of outstanding tracks on this CD : HERBERT HARPERS......., IS IT BECAUSE I'M BLACK, BLACK MIDNIGHT SUN, TALKING LOUD AND SAYING NOTHING, TRULY YOUR FRIEND. They are worth 5 stars. Some of the other tracks border on 1 / 2 stars and bring the rest of the CD down. The skip button gets a workout for LUCKY IN LOVE ( it was [bad] when MICK JAGGER released the single ages ago and got worse with age ), SHE'S A BURGLAR ( blues dross ) and some of the others are barely acceptable. The musicianship is uniformly great and LUCKY sure is a talented musician. His guitar / keyboard playing is first class as is his singing. I just wish he had picked a better range of covers to do his talents justice"
5,Revolutionary & futuristic form of Blues,"I think lots of people consider Lucky Peterson as a bluesman. That's true, but with this new album, he proved that he can go even beyond that. He successfully blended rock, soul, and funk elements into these 11 songs without compromising the conventional side of the blues music. Producer/Bassist Bill Laswell's bone-rattling rhythms of funk work very well here. This album is a must-have for those who want to see the future of blues."
2,hopefully *not* the future of blues,"I was really disappointed by this recording - the songs are tired, and the effects on Bill Laswell's bass single handedly ruins the mix. I don't know what Laswell thought he was doing, it is that bad. On the first 10 seconds of the first song it sounds interesting but then it overpowers and dominates. It is a blurry mess of phased, flanged, who-knows-what, over processed, boomy bass noodling. Skip this one, trust me. You'll be taking it to the used record store in a week."
3,Purchased a used book,"I purchased a used book the was described as in excellent condition. There is crayon coloring on several pages, and it is stamped with library stamps, as well as having a name written on the outside front cover. I do not consider that to be excellent condition. The pages are all intact. It did not arrive until the end of the 3 week shipping period, when other items purchased on the same day arrived a full week ahead."
3,The Word of Life,"Dear Whom it may concern,It took such a long time to receive the book as it is taking a very long time for the latest book I ordered.I was about to contact your company, when the book arrived. I hope that my other book will come soon.Thanks for asking.Debra"
5,War Heroes,Very inspiring accounts of the actions of Medal of Honor Recipients. Easy to read and you don't want to put it down.
3,"I wanted very much to give this five stars, but ""minor"" factual errors caused me to doubt the whole.","I wanted very much to give this five stars, but ""minor"" factual errors caused me to doubt the whole. The biggest error I saw was about Lewis L. Millett. ""In 1960, he started the U.S. Army Rangers""(p.133). I was also amazed to find out that a K-bar knife has a ten inch blade. These are just a couple of things that jumped out at me.Military readers have a keen eye for detail, and glorious deeds may be doubted due to sloppy editing and poor fact checking. I suspect that this book is basically true, but don't make me work at it. Revise and republish."
4,One of Carolyn Davidson's better reads!,"I'm not a huge fan of Carolyn Davidson. With a few exceptions, I find her books corny and sexist. The hero here is still pretty macho, but not unlikeable, and the parson's daughter shows some spunk now and then. It's an interesting premise to a marriage of convenience. To avoid the ""Bachelor Tax"", rancher Gabe Tanner has to at least propose marriage. He chooses Rosemary Gibson, the ""starchy, uptight"" preacher's daughter, just sure she'll turn him down. Due to the recent death of her father, and the arrival of the replacement preacher - and his large family - she is now homeless, and desperate. So she decides to accept his offer, but changes her position to that of ""cook"" instead. A growing mutual passion and two abused children added to the mix make marriage seem like a good idea. Read it if you want to find out how it all works out!"
3,Not bad at all. Attitude intact.,"David Lee Roth is as much about being Dave as being musical. That said, there's always been something appealing in his limited voice, and Dave plays to his strengths on this mostly-covers album. (Think Diver Down.) There's nothing that really rocks, but this is a strong addition to Dave's eclectic solo career. The big band version of ""Ice Cream Man"" is fantastic. The fans will demand a real rock album next, but if Dave delivers one, this will be an enjoyable diversion for his fans."
3,Stop the covers and go back to rocking with a great band,"I find it a shame that an entertainer that I really enjoy falls in the trap of the quick buck. David Lee Roth has a certain skill that is only evident in about half the songs on this CD. I have only listened to the cd once and it has the potential of growing on me but David Lee Roth could do so much better. If he is reading my suggestion go get yourself a top notch band similar to ""Eat'em and Smile"" days then play what you know rock n' roll with a blues edge and show everyone you still have the talent. In closing true DLR fans like myself will give this some repeated listens but others beware."
1,Its just cheezy!,"OK, Dave likes to expand his musical horizons right? Let's face it, Roth is on another planet! The music sounds cheezy, hokey & just plain comedic. Like Dave!But we all know Dave only laughs histerically at his own jokes. Well this record is a joke. When I heard ""Soul Kitchen"", I though it was Smashmouth! Dave's career after Van Halen is a far cry from success considering when attending his concert, its ALL Van Halen.These songs will never see the light of day performed in front of an audience. The fans would all leave for the bathroom! Having said that, this is just the type of music that the once great Diamond Dave disappoints us with.But wait disappointing Van Halen fans is part of Dave's master plan. He's suing Van Halen for royalty rights over songs recorded for 1996's Best of. Kiss a Van Halen reunion good bye. DON'T buy this album!"
1,Somebody get me a doctor....,Dave Lee Roth has now gone down the ladder as far as this CD goes. I hate bands that release covers and this just shows he cannot write anything.
4,Don't let Dave's image fool you--great blues album!,"I hesitated to buy this album because of the cover. It appeared that Dave was still clinging to his worn out party animal image. But, I'm impressed with the quality of the songs. Dave's still a great singer, and has excellent musicians working with him. The songs are covers, but there's plenty of original creativity in the remaking of them. Redoing a Beatles or Hendrix song can be an embarrasing failure, but Dave and his friends pull it off well. I hope Dave sticks to this bluesy type stuff; it's what he does best."
1,Four Words: Don't waste you money!,"David Lee Roth continues to prove that, without Van Halen, he has little to offer. I thought that his ""DLR Band"" album was bad but this has to be his worst release yet. I only bought this album because I'm a lifelong Van Halen fan and have every album that VH, DLR, and Sammy Hagar, have released. If I could do it over again, I would've read all the reviews and not just the top three.Save your money because you'll be able to find this CD, in the 99 cent bin at your local record store, in no time at all! It will be sitting right next to his DLR Band CD."
2,Daves Voice Good Weak Album,"It should be a lesson that when Dave was tourin w/ Haggar he should have read the reviews. Its the rocker Dave in raw talent thats good. Lets face it..if the songs sound good it is good. Well, the voice is good but the songs are laughable. Anybody can play those songs even my 3 year old daughter. Dave, need a rock album buddy. a good one. I hear Marty Friedman formally from Megadeth is lookin. U need an axeman like that! If you want to get back into it instead of playin in nightclubs..you need a new album that rocks!!!"
1,Yawn yawn yawn ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Diamond Dave is a crap album. This guy was only cool with 2 guitarists, Eddie VH and Steve Vai. As for this album, boring covers all the way through with a naff version of Icecream Man. All you can tell from this is that DLR has lost all direction. He couldn't get back with VH. Other musicians have dropped him. Perhaps it's time he retired. After all is getting old now."
1,Worst album ever!,I listened to these songs and they all suck this is not considered Rock N Roll Avoid this album at all costs!
3,nah,"sorry DLR fans I bought the CD so I have the right to review thisto me, this is a pretty weird album, some songs are too long, other are neither rock nor pop...this is really hard to enjoy immediately, it may take multiple listenings. However, what is clearly missing are hooks/catchy choruses, and the guitar sucks.I am afraid you can find much, much more stimulating rock music among Sammy Hagar's releases (try 10/3 and N4S)..."
1,JIMMY SAVILLE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER !,"When is Dave Lee Roth going get rid of all the Diamond Dave nonsence he started up in the Eighties? If it were not for Eddie Van Halen's guitar work in the beginning this man would never of got anywhere, and if it weren't for Van Halen DLR would have never had a stepping stone to carry on. This album is literally all covers by artists that CAN write music. For the hard rockers amongst you, forget it, like the cover of this Album, DLR is just an ageing has-been that looks and sounds like Jimmy Saville."
4,ignore the negative reviews..,If your a DLR fan you will love this album. It's a great mix of tunes and Dave's voice sounds great. Ignore the negative reviews and check it out.
4,Classic Dave,"Dave is back with this one. This is a slightly more mellow than the Dave in Van Halen and from Eat 'em and Smile. This is music done the only way, the Dave way. I hadn't even realized this had come out, and recently decided to get all his solo stuff on CD (hence a review 4 years after it came out). This one seems to have flown completely under my radar despite my having been a fan for 30 years. This is a very good album and is worth picking up."
4,Great comedy/ Poor Quality DVD,"I've seen this movie ""L'animal"" in 1977 in Europe and absolutely loved it!Belmondo and Raquel Welch made a perfect 'Beauty and the Beast' couple: she was stunning and he was ugly as hell and funny.The strange thing about this DVD that the scene described on the DVD cover, where Mike Gaucher pretends not to be able to hear, speak and walk to get a welfare didn't appear on the DVD. It's a shame!The quality of the DVD itself is extremely bad! It looks like that this copy has been made from the TV. I should try to get another one from a different producer hoping to find a better quality of one of my favorite comedies of all times."
4,Gotta Love Raquel,"Here is a fun movie with the classic bombshell Raquel Welsh, Its fun to watch and has some of the sexiest video moments of Raquel ever wearing a nearly see through wed dress. Gota love that Raquel."
1,unbelievably bad !!!,"Wow, this movie is the oddest retro 1950's documentary ever. Throughout the story are endlessly repeated footage(some repeated more than ten times through the episodes) while the broad-statement voiceovers seem to bear little to no relationship to the photos and videos you are seeing. The entire story of Russia and the Revolution was captured in two sentences about half-way through. Individual episodes start by jumping back in time to long before the previous episode ended....so you keep covering the same ground. Historical significance is defined only in the broadest-brush concepts and no real chronology is ever provided. Finally, the in-house history expert had meandering explanations and questionable grammar. I love history but this oddball production really shreds it badly."
4,should have worn socks!,i was so exctied to get these band and not only have they help put variety into my workout. I can feel the difference i have from using them already. I would however advise wearing anklets or socks of some sort with these as i rubbed the front of my ankles a little raw the first time out.well worth the money and they are good quality
3,Medium & Heavy Resistance Bands,The reason I rated them three was the difficulty of having them placed on your ankle and foot. Otherwise delivery was fast & I was satisfied with that part. I kept them maybe someone else I know will try them but for me they just aren't what I was looking for:)
3,not as easy to work with as expected,these are not giving me the tension I expected. need to work with them a little more than I was planning- thought they would be much easier.
4,Not for the weak,These had much more resistance than I thought they would. Beginners would be better off starting with SRPI yellow and green Xerings.
2,"Might be a good resistance tool but, not for me.",I saw it demonstrated on the view looked like it was for me. Personally the bands were very tight and irritated my ankles. -I think it may work for others but it was not how it thought it would be. Ithink if you weak or tender ankels these ar not for you.
2,Snapped,"I bought the Red & Blue Rings together, worked up to the Blue after several weeks. After using the Blue for about six weeks three times a week it broke sending the black cushion part flying across the room (just missing my dog). I had used it less tham two months but because I bought more than 3 months ago niether Amazon or SPRI would warranty it. Beware and becareful."
4,"easy use, good for beginners","as every body knows how this one works and I think not too much comments on it. good thing is I can carry it with me during my traveling. easy use, straight forward and low cost. enjoy it."
2,not a good trimmer,"i had it for a day.. its really cheap, and the shape of the product makes it difficult to use.. i ended up returning it"
2,Disappointing 1-disc collection,"I found this collection to be very disappointing in that it's 100% mono. One can argue that in some cases, the mono mix sounds more like the original hit song as heard in the mid-1960s, but to me, several of the Roger Miller hits are better in stereo (particularly ""England Swings"" and ""Little Green Apples"").Also, Miller only had 12 Top 40 American hits, but this collection omits two -- ""Walkin' in the Sunshine"" and ""Little Green Apples"" -- and replaces them with relatively-minor songs like ""Atta Boy Girl"" and ""In the Summertime.""You gotta wonder who is handling Mercury's reissue department these days. Instead of this collection, my advice is that you find the previous Mercury collections ""The Best of Roger Miller - Vol. 1: Country Tunesmith"" and ""The Best of Roger Miller - Vol. 2: King of the Road,"" which are far superior. Most of their tracks are in stereo, too."
5,good,"the product arrives like the store says! no problems with the delevery and the product, good perfume, and the best thing, cheap"
5,Accoustic Paradise,"Andy McKee AND Antoine Dufour on one DVD! Perfect for people who appreciate clean, uncluttered performance. Awesome to watch these two amazing musicians!"
1,Grow Up Daddy,I started to read this book and at first found it somewhat amusing. The author started working my last nerve after the third chapter. His sense of humor was annoyingly monotonous. If this is a true account of his life I feel bad for his wife AND his kids.
1,Not Pleased,"I am a new father (my son was born March 6, 1998). There have been good times and hard times. I purchased many books to help me with being a ""new father"". My expectations when purchasing this book was to read about the comical and touching adventures of a new father. Instead he focuses more on his own destructive habits such as smoking, drinking alcohol and coffee, rather than the joys and early stages of fatherhood. I'm sorry to say that if this writer publishes another book, I would be very hesitant to read it."
1,New Dad,"I cannot relate to this author. I found his book boring, so much so that I was unable to finish it. I would not recomend this book to anyone."
3,""" Pleasure is Political""","Dr. Tiger takes the pulse of society's rules: We tell you what is pleasure... we tell you when you can have it... we will tax it... we will regulate it... and in the end... you may or may not be able to have the experience you intended at a cost that we have predetermined for you to pay.Every function of a human is based on the Pleasure/Pain Principle.. the food we eat, the music we hear... every sense in every sense of the word.Dr. Tiger came out of ""academia"" to write a book about our everyday lives... in a form that even the non-educated can enjoy and understand."
4,Love It,Great purchase! Only inconvience having to get the links adjusted to fit.Ordered as a gift and it arrived in two days just in time and in mint condition. Such a nice watch at a great price! Would recommend to anyone
3,Nothing special...,"This is an ok watch. There's nothing special about it. For those of you thinking about buying this watch, beware that the actual product is silver-tone only, instead of the two tones displayed in the picture. The watch displayed in the picture is actually Kenneth Cole KC3916. This wouldn't have been a big issue, except that the watch arrived last night, which I purchased for my husband's birthday tomorrow, and now I'm not going to have his present to give him. On the other hand, I contacted Savvy, and they replied within a few hours. They sent me the return label (return shipping on them) and offered to send me the correct item (which now I learned is more expensive) as soon as they get this one back. Although I wish there would've been no confusion to begin with, I'm happy with Savvy's customer service and their promise to get it right."
1,They send me the wrong watch,They send me the wrong watch Where I did not have time to ship back and forth Because i was doing my christmas Shoping But I will never buy through amazon AgainThank you
2,Too much variation for my taste.,"I received the forks I ordered and was disappointed. They are not very good copies, lacking the graceful curves, smooth tines, and body of the original design. That said, I placed the copies I just received next to the original ones I have and showed them to another person, asking her if she could see any difference, and she couldn't. After I pointed out the differences to her, she did see them, but she didn't think it was such a big deal. Now I am undecided about sending them back, wondering if I'll just be creating an unnecessary hassle for myself by trying to find a better match. I don't recommend these copies of the Dansk Variation V forks to people who are very discerning."
3,Track Listing,"Since Amazon didn't do any research, I'll be nice and post the track listing for this album.1. Divit -Breakin The Law2. Jughead's Revenge -Talk Dirty To Me3. AFI -My Michelle4.

5,beautiful,"love at first sight.....the size (1 1/2 qt) is just perfect for a small apartment......it is strange however, that i can't find the county of orgin.....anywhere"
4,Beware scratches and dings from shipping!,The only reason I am giving this four stars is because I received my 12 piece set with scratches in the 3 qt saucepan and a ding on the lip of the 2 qt saucepan. Suffice it to say I had to return the WHOLE set per Amazon's return policy. Seems to me they could pad it more adequately for shipping. I have previously cooked with the Analon Titanium in my fathers kitchen and I loved it so much I had to have it. Cleans like a dream!
5,The Perfect Cookware Set,"I have purchased an Anolon Titanium Non Stick Dishwasher Safe 12-Piece Cookware Set and am ONE HAPPY COOK:-) The set is well-made, clearly very durable and has the weight & feel of professional cookware, with the added bonus of nonstick! This set would make an excellent wedding or housewarming gift and will be a source of cooking pleasure for any cook!! This set is a MUST HAVE!!!"
4,How do you increase the joy of cooking?,"Buy this item. Honestly, it is very easy to cook with. The nonstick surfaces are a breeze to cook with and clean. We have had them for a week now and are very pleased with the set. Much cheaper than the retail stores (Bed, Bath, etc.). Don't have long term reliability info yet, but based on the reviewes I read before buying this set, I don't expect to be disappointed."
5,LOVE this cookware!,"I LOVE this line of cookware. They heat evenly, clean up VERY easily. (although I have never put them in the dishwasher). I prefer these to Circulon as the circulon cookware is harder to clean food bits out of the bottom grooves. Analon is smooth inside. If anything does get burnt or stuck, just soak a few minutes in warm soapy water and everything comes right off. I highly recommend any cookware from this line. I have been adding pieces to my set as often as I can."
5,Very Nice,"Everyone should invest in a good set of pans. These are the best pans I have ever used, especiaaly for the money. Reasonably priced with top notch quality. The first time I made an omelette with no oil or butter, my wife was amazed."
4,Anolon Titanium Non Stick Cookware Set,"In general, I've been very pleased with this cookware set. Heats up easily, cooks food evenly, and cleans up well. The sizing and variety of the pots and pans have worked out great for me, and they've been the best set I've ever owned. I love that they are dishwasher safe - clean up couldn't be better.The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because a few of the pans arrived with chips on the inside finish along the top edge of the pan. Hopefully this doesn't affect the useful life of the set, but I was disappointed. I'm not sure if it was a packaging issue, and since they were on the pans I would use the least, I decided not to send back the set."
5,Best pots and pans so far,"I did a lot of research, continually looking for a good set of pots and pans at stores and online. This set has been wonderful in the 6 months I have had them and have proven to be a great choice.These a very high quality, hold their heat well and heat evenly. The non-stick surface has shown itself to be very effective. The dishwasher safe feature was the dealbreaker. I didn't want a set of cookware that I had to hand wash, and these have held up very well (no noticeable wear so far) from going into and out of the dishwasher on a daily basis.The set includes all you need, even though i would rather have a 6 or 8 quart stockpot than the 10... it's a bit too big for my needs.A great choice at a very good price on amazon."
4,"Nice cookware,,,,,,,but a problem","Just received this 12 piece set, but there is a slight problem. My set was supposed to have a 10 quart stockpot, but what I received was an 8 quart stockpot with a 10 quart lid for it. I don't think this is a random problem as my friend received her set the day after I did and hers has the same problem. Otherwise this looks to be a quality product that should last a long time. Also noticed that the bottom of the 10 inch skillet is marked as a Cooks brand for JCPenneys, but looks identical to the rest of the set."
1,Very disappointed.,"As avid Scottish Terrier owners, my wife and I were very excited to receive this book.Unfortunately, the shipping was delayed and when it finally arrived it appeared to be more of a desk top publishing exercisethan a real ""book"".There's nothing new in the text and when we e-mailed the support team with a question, contrary to the text in the book, we DID NOT receive a prompt answer. In fact, after three emails we have given up hope of ever getting an answer from Ms. Terri Sprinkle or her staff. We expected more. Especially considering the price."
3,Grooming guide,"Nice to have as a reference, but for my needs I should have purchased a video. Not quite enough specific details."
5,Timeless classics that somehow sound brand new,"Somehow Crystal's style and voice have made these timeless classics sound like never before heard songs that you already know all the words to. The CD is like revisiting an old friend, both with Crystal and the so long forgotten but yet well remembered songs of the past. One listen to the CD and you will be hooked and wishing for even more songs than the CD holds. With so many albums behind her and hoards of music styles, I'm glad to see her back into music making, and what a way to come back! The music, her voice, the songs she picked for the CD truly shows her musical abilities. If you want to go back in time in a modern way, you have to hear this CD!"
2,"Beautiful arrangements, but Gayle's voice is strained","Crystal Gayle has been my favorite singer since I was 16. As much as I would love to give a great review of this work, I cannot. In the last decade, it has saddened me to hear Gayle's voice deteriorating so much. I am embarrased for her that she would release tracks where there is obvious straining for notes. I understand that there is a need to please the fan base, but even these vocally unchallenging tracks are compromised. I am sorry, Crystal- I just miss the good ol' days!"
1,stop doing covers everytime,gave just 1 star because theres nothing new here crystal gaylemade great career at warnerbros produced by jimmy bowen throughout 80s check albums nobody wants to be alone half of it produced by michael masser also recorded hugh prestwood song sound of goodbye did someone notice that reviewer taylor said he liked the release but only gave couple of stars in fact music is being poisoned by hip hop if we want get out of this mess record companies &singers must wake up &ask prs bmi&ascap sesac songwriters to write material albert hammond&jimmy webb &barry mann are still active
5,Astonishing Pianism,"As a student of piano, my goal is to learn to play like Budyonny plays. This CD is worth every penny."
5,"Heartwarming, thought provoking message.","Love the book, Alfie the Christmas Tree. The message is simple, yet encourages all who read it to remember all living things during the Holiday Season. And I quote Mr. Denver,""Say a prayer for the Wind, and the Water, and the Wood, and those that live there too""."
5,Great Series,This book continues where Retaliation left off and continues this series. If you liked the first book then you will like this one.
3,More Benoit!,"I think they should have had ALL of Benoit's songs on here! I also think they should have used the American cast, but whatever. I loved the Dear Louisan song and I was very disapointed it wasn't included in the recording. If this cd had contained all of his songs, I would have given it all five stars. Maybe later they'll catch the mood and add him on."
2,Interesting Devlopment,"Having seen the West End version (No 3 I think) I was intrigued to hear this reworking. Like so many theatrical works it can take some time for the production team(s) to find the right combination and I think Martin Guerre is possibly one of those. The original story was going to be difficult to transfer to the stage from day one. The scale, the complex plot and the credibilty were always going to be a challenge. This version could be one of those productions that relies on the visuals to make it enjoyable as the patchy score does nothing to assist the listener. I certainly missed some of the stunning music and orchestrations from the original (Working on The Land, Bethlehem & Here Come The Morning). I will continue listening - to the original!"
1,Bring back the original!,"Ugh! I'm realy disappointed. I had the original, but my copy got ruined (probably through overuse). So when this came out I leapt to get it. Much to my dismay I found my favourite songs had been cut out, and the ones left had been changed beyond all recogniton. So I am now hunting the original which is impossible to find.All I can say about this, is don't waste your money."
2,What happened to the original?,"I saw the first version of Martin Guerre in London in 1997. I found the music catchy, and the plot very interesting. When I heard of the changes Boublil and Schonberg made to the show, I decided to buy the new album. I was disappointed to say the least. I found that almost all of the songs had been changed, and those that remained now had new lyrics. I enjoyed the version I saw in England and am sad to see that any remnant, even the soundtrack, from the original version will never see the light of day again. If there is any way to get it, I would recommend you get the first version and not this one."
2,A Step Down from the Original,"I have to say I'm fairly disappointed with this revamped version of the show. I can see why the changes were made, which I believe were to flesh out more of the story and make things a little clearer than the original. The only other improvement I can think of off the top of my head is the lyrics, which are sharper and less cheesy than the 1996 counterpart. Unfortunately, by improving the story, they've sacrificed the music and overall emotional quality of the show, and knowing these writers from their previous work, I guess I've been spoiled expecting high quality music and storytelling. Unless you're a diehard theater and Boublil/Schonberg fan, I'd definitely go with the 1996 version. The tunes are nicer, better sung, and the orchestrations are astronomically better! I'm a little hesitant now to see the show."
4,"All-new, improved, and altogether different!","I enjoyed this new version a lot. The voices were better, some of the music is better (""How Many Tears"" is one of the best ballads I've heard from this team!), and the concept is very scaled-down. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me, is that I miss the wonderful orchestrations from the original version. I recommend this CD highly!"
3,Where is the original cast recording?,"This is not it! In 1997, my husband and I saw Martin Guerre in London. Afterwards, I had to buy the tape. It was wonderful. Now, no matter which buying service I choose, no one is selling the 1996 recording. This album included one song called Bethlehem that would make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Why am I looking for another tape? Someone stole mine out of my car. If anyone knows where I can get one let me know."
2,Disappointing from the creators of Les Mis and Miss Saigon,"I had purchased the Original London Cast Album of ""Martin Guerre"" about five years ago. I remember being struck by the beautiful opening melody of the cd. I knew that this show had been inundated with change from its opening and that changes had been made to the tour. But what a disappointment! Musically, this cd is just a shadow of what the original was like. It was a bummer. Also, this is from the team that brought us Les Miserables and Miss Saigon. These are two shows with plenty of great songs and melodies...Martin Guerre had a lot of potential, but somewhere it got bogged down...and that's too bad. I would reccommend this cd if you are a die hard Boublil & Schonberg fan and you have a need to own both recordings of this show. My opinion would be to search out the original recording (I don't even know if it's available anymore)."
1,Don't bother with this version!,"In my opinion the 1999 version of Martin Guerre pales in comparison to the original 1996 version. They've taken out the orchestra and replaced it with synthesizers and pianos, and scraped most of the amazing themes from the original. Granted, theaters like the Guthrie in Minneapolis (where this version is making its North American premiere) cannot house an orchestra, but still the new version sounds so hollow without a full orchestra backing it up. The lyrics are not as poetic as the original nor do they have the same emotional intensity. Even the plot has been rewritten to prattle on about Satan and witches, while the original was much more poignant and relevant in a simple clash between Protestants and Catholics. I am extremely disappointed in this re-vamped version and I am glad I didn't wasted 50 bucks for tickets to see it while its here in Minnesota."
3,"Very good, but try and find the 1995 original. Please!","Everyone,I am a big B&S; fan, but I truly think Martin Guerre is their finest work! Though not a commercial success like Les Miz or Miss Saigon, this is a lofty work which has some of the most beautiful music that I have ever heard (truly). Unfortunately, I think the 1999 CD version does not do justice to the majesty of the work. In an effort to streamline the work to make it more palatable to mass audiences (ie. American), the best pieces have been removed from the original. If you are a fan of MG, you will enjoy this version -- if so, buy. But after you do so, do whatever it takes to acquire the 1995 version. I promise that you will not be disappointed.Here is a note to any theatrical producer out there. If you have the means and the desire to bless the world with the original MG production, I will personally buy 5 tickets just to support the effort whether I can attend or not. This is a work that deserves more attention than what it received."
4,Wonderful Music,"I saw this show at the Kennedy Center, and I fell in love with the music. It is wonderful, full of romance, and intrigue. Although I have to admit that the leads in the show in the US do a better job than the cast on the CD, it is still wonder nonetheless. I recommend it for anyone who loved Les Mis and Miss Saigon"
3,Under-cooked,"Whilst this CD of the 1999 version of Martin Guerre is musically and dramatically attractive and is well-performed, it is very doubtful to me whether it improves upon the 1996 CD in any respect. What seems undeniable is that the accompaniment is so emasculated and synthesizer-orientated that the whole thing - originally conceived as it was upon a grander, orchestral scale - sounds badly and irritatingly under-cooked; whilst the noble, powerful and thrillingly scored music which began and ended the 1996 version has disappeared altogether. It is reminiscent of those chamber versions of grand operas which tour small theatres and which, however attractively arranged and performed, always leave one wanting to hear the real thing. In my view they got Martin Guerre magnificently right first time around and it is greatly to be hoped that the original score will be revived one day. Enjoy this 1999 CD; but try to listen to the 1996 version in order to hear how the show should really sound."
5,Exceptional!,"Firstly, this show in itself is remarkable. It truly is ingenious theatre - with beautiful and powerful melodies, and a romantic plot layered with betrayal, friendship, prejudice, and hatred. It is done with pure brilliance! As for this recording of the CD itself, it's wonderful. The cast (headed by Matthew Cammelle, Joanna Riding, and Stephen Weller) have good voices and their strong acting abilities shine through. The song selection is a little strange at times, but there are scenes (eg, the jail scene) that were not recorded on the original London recording and are preserved here, with all the power and integrity of the show. If you listen to this carefully and look beneath the surface of the show, you're bound to be enthralled."
2,An Inferior Show and a Step Down for the CD,"I own both cast recording CDs and have seen the show and I have to say that I prefer the original CD to the current production that has reduced the scope of the music and made it very brassy and sparse.The musical left me mostly uninspired (as it did most of the audience that remained firmly planted in their seats.) The material just doesn't give you much to care about.After seeing the show I went back to my original recording and play that one occasionaly. If you're a true fan and you can find it, get it -- otherwise I wouldn't bother."
2,What were they thinking?,"Onstage, this version of Martin Guerre was dreary, boring, and painful to sit through. That makes this disc an almost perfect representation of the stage show. The music is almost entirely unmemorable, and sounds mostly like a combination of all the wrong parts of Les Miserables and Miss Saigon assembled in a confusing amalgam. The cast is game, and skilled, if not quite magnetic enough to draw your attention away from the stunningly weak material. Skip this recording--your money would be much better spent on another recording of either of Boublil and Schonberg's other, better works."
2,Disappointing.,"The orchestrations are dull; the melodies limp. Schonberg seems, with each successive show, to have a harder time coming up with the compelling, romantic melodies he's known for. With ""Martin Guerre,"" he's pretty much out of ideas. But, most embarrassing of all, who ever told Alain Boublil that he has what it takes to write lyrics in English? The lyrics in ""Miss Saigon"" were truly stupid (how many words can you rhyme with ""ass""?), but the ""Martin Guerre"" lyrics are just as bad--the lyrics in ""Martin Guerre"" are obviously not the work of someone for whom English is his first language. Perhaps they should bring back Herbert Kretzmer as their lyricist in the future. And take a little time off so Claude-Michel can come up with some good melodies this time, instead of the pseudo-Lloyd Webber of ""Martin Guerre."""
1,Give me a break,"These two writers maxed out their talent with Les Miz. These tunes are cheap imitations. ""Live with someone you love."" Uh, ok, I hadn't thought of that. Having seen the premiere of this musical in Minneapolis, it was remarkably unengaging. There are some agreeable numbers, but overall it pales...I put it in the same league as Jekyll and Hyde and other goofy, commercial shows"
2,does not look like picture,I ordered this item and only one came in the box and it was broke. poor quality product and very poor packaging. Update: Vendor did refund money promptly. I am satisfied with cutomer service.
3,Its not what I thought,I bought this for a strongman competition because I thought it allow more flexibility for certian events. All in all its ok but I still prefer a real powerlifting belt.
5,Can lamp (black),Was as good as expected and served the purpose for which it was purchased. Very well lights subject area intended. Would recommend buying for direct spot lighting on any item.
2,not as great as it should have been.,"this album didn't really do much for me.don't get me wrong,i love this group.this release just wasn't heavy enough.the bands other efforts were a lot better and on top of that the album only has five songs."
2,Not Great,The stories were weak. Most of them lack direction and focus. The one or two that had meaning were simple and not thought provoking. Very disappointing.
4,Christmas stories and simple crafts,"This book describes some of the Bible stories behind the Christmas holiday, along with some craft and decorating ideas. There are also cookie recipes and some (non-alcoholic) punch recipes which use readily available ingredients. Martha Stewart it's not, but this would be a good book if you were hosting a kids' party or looking for some simple but nice decorating ideas for the holidays."
4,Celebrating Christmas,Celebrating Christmas is a beautifully put together book with costume ideas for playing out the story of Jesus birth. It is full of wonderful Christmas stories and has some crafts and recipes. I was looking for more of a craft and decorating book and this book was not what I was expecting. But a beautifully put together book.
5,witty and practical,"Great sense of humor. You wont agree with everything she says, but it will give you a refreshing perspective on the ridiculous wedding drama that seems to take place preceding every wedding.It helps you plan a classy wedding without getting sucked into the greedy world of the wedding industrial complex."
4,Very Entertaining,"7/11/05 Beside beginning the Answer Section with ""Gentle Reader"", which is quite a pleasant intro in the Q & A section, the Judith Martin's ""manner's guide"" has several situations which are contemporary(e.g. :Pg 778 :""it is rude to ask someone to bring you back presents when they go on vacation"").Her acknowledgements section (to David Hendin,Angela von der Lippe, Kimberley Heatherington,Thomas Stewart,Diana Drake,Jennifer Georgia & her ""Gentle Readers"") follows her Pg 825-826, which are answers to questions nobody ever asked."
