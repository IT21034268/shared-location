1,Waste of Time!,"Geez, if there is a half-star rating here, i could have selected that one, giving this camera 1 star is too much i think... The pictures are all [bad]! no picture came out good at all... everything was blurred and every shot was so bright, everybody was white. No part of the pictures are in clear focus. Would return this camera right away. Olympus disappointed me on this one... I love olympus camera, had three 35mm Olympus cameras and they were all great. that's not the case when I switched to APS camera by Olympus.I don't know if the Newpic Zoom 90 is better than this one. I called olympus and they said the I Zoom 3000 is better than the Newpic Zoom 90, because it is newer. I can't find any online store now that sells newpic 90 brand new, if there is, it is way too much expensive, but its reviews were cool.This camera is NOT RECOMMENDED! stay away."
3,Perfect Camera for a Photographer!,"This camera was made for people who can handle a camera and be very steady with it! My pictures came out amazing! There are different kind of shots you can use, long photos and regular 4 x6 ones. However it wasn't suitable because the battery dies out really fast.."
1,this Ain't like the Green Lion Trilogy,"I must say that I was terribly disappointed by this incredibly disjointed, ill-told story. After Teleri and Ceilyn (from the Green Lion Trilogy), I thought Gwenlliant's story would be amazing. There is no wonder in this book. Just a lot of angst. Very, very disappointing."
4,A ripping good yarn...,"... but not perfection. Basically I agree with previous reader reviews, but there were just too many little things that slipped past the editor -- such things as the use of ""proceed"" for ""precede"", and a non-corporeal alien from another dimension thinking that a passing ship would be its ""only ticket"" off a planet. I mean, when in its timeless existence would such a being have ever bought a ticket anywhere?Minor cavils aside, I hugely enjoyed the book."
4,Life meets art in this delicious fiction,"I'm a busy, working dad, I can relate to this guy. Wish I could find a magic chocolate rabbit, and not just for my kids, but for me too! The kids loved this book, it would make a great Easter present."
4,A terrific kid's book,"Great story, gorgeous colour drawings. My family thought this was a great kid's story even though we didn't read it at Easter time. It has meaning and a moral for anytime of the year. Just great!!!"
5,Yummy bunny tale,"cute story, cute pics.....loved it and so did the kids. Buy it for Easter and give to someone you love with some chocolate eggs."
1,hap ki do,"this movie was not the greatest movie I have ever seen, in fact I didn't like it at all. I recomend that you don't waste your money on this film, but its up to you. this was such a bad move that I can't really tell you much about it without spoiling it. I mainly disliked it because it had no plot."
4,An entertaining look at 2 of the best sportscasters on tv.,"This is one of those books that, becuase of Dan and Keith's style of delivery, is better heard than read. Both were very accurate in their rebuke of the baseball hall of fame selection process. The 3rd top 10 list was a little boring. Overall the book is very entertaiing."
1,Did not work,"I bought two of these, and neither one of them work. I assume that if the the company had not sent me two clearly older and used models, they would have been fine. So really, this is not a criticism of the wall chargers, but of A1 Technology."
1,Not Funny - More Rambling than Entertaining,"I love stand-up comedy, from Anthony Jeselnik to Orny Adams. The dirtier the better and the raunchier the better. BUT... Donzilla is very weak on entertainment.My idiot friends tell better jokes. I know Don Tjernagel is trying, I know not all material is first place, but man this just got annoying. There's no routine. His 'Shtick' sounds likes my alcoholic brother in-law during Thanksgiving dinner. At least my brother in-law calls the family the next day and apologizes for vomiting on the cat.Words to describe this? It is whining, unintelligible, babbling, belligerent, boorish ranting. Come on man! Pick a topic and take me on an adventure! This is supposed to entertain. But for me, it misses the comedic on ramp and skids across a verbal puddle of stupidity. And not good stupidity either, in fact I feel bad for this comic.The audience even sounds downtrodden. Or, someone spiked their drinks with Xanax before the 'show.'"
5,Excellent book on appellate writing,"If you're going to be writing appellate briefs, this is the book. I used this in my app ad class and it has some great info in it. I will be keeping this on my bookshelf."
5,Recommended by the Ninth Circuit,"The Ninth Circuit has recommended this book. See Dela Rosa v. Scottsdale Mem. Health Systems, Inc., 136 F.3d 1241, 1244 n.2 (9th Cir. 1998) (""We strongly advise attorneys who intend to present a case to this court for the first time and, indeed, all attorneys who practice before this court to consider the wisdom contained in an insightful and intelligent book on the subject of appeals: Ruggero J. Aldisert, Winning on Appeal (NITA 1997)."") (order) (case no. 96-17034)."
4,makes decorating very easy,If you are short on time you will love these. Makes decorating a cake quick and easy!
5,Wilton 2104-3160 12 piece cake-decorating press set,a very good pieces for the decorating when you have a kids who really does lovs new things for the cake decorating.
3,its okay,i have only used this item once and maybe i was doing it wrong but it seemed like if you dont push it into the frosting enough you cant see the lines ... and if you push it in to much it pulls BIG chunks of frosting out ... but maybe i just need to practice with it more
5,great decoration molds,The item is of great craftsmenship. It is exactly what I expected and will look forward to years of using the item because it is just what I wanted and even more. I highly recommend this product and the seller.
4,Wilton Cake Decorating Press Set,"Item was received quickly and came in great condition. Have not used it yet, but am looking forward to using it soon."
4,Simple and easy to use,"While they are made of inexpensive type plastic, they do the job well. Only complaint is the designs themselves, they seem a little yesterday to me. But, for our first set, we are happy to have them. Will definitely get a better set later, but for the price you can't complain."
2,Not impressed that much,Bought this set 2 years ago and used it for about 2 times. I was not impressed very much. The design was kind of dull and old fashioned.
5,WOW!,"Krux... formed by the bassman of candlemass this great CD is something i didnt expected to be so good! this is stoner metal blend with old school metal! this for the fans of Black Sabbath & Zeppelin! with members of candlemass,entombed,at vance & more you can't go wrong! I hope to see this band on tour or at least on an another CD! this is a must!"
2,Beware! It's NOT Complete!,"I noticed from the track list the conspicuous absence of at least one great tune from the Restless and Wild album: Demon's Night. If you've listened to the original, you know that this is one wicked piece of metal and not to be missed.Also missing is Ahead of the Pack, another great song from R&W.; I'm not aware of the whole songs list from Balls, so I don't know what was cut from there. All in all, it appears that 5 songs were cut between the two albums.If you're a passing Accept fan then maybe this is for you. On the other hand if you're a full-blown Acceptonaut, then you must get the separate albums of Restless and Balls. Go ahead and throw in Metal Heart while you're at it, to make a great trio."
4,urn pendant,"This is a nice pendant. Slightly larger than some I have seen, but yet tastefully done. I did not glue it the first time I filled it, & my father ""came out"" at my job! I learned then to glue it, & enjoy wearing him around my neck, close to mt heart."
4,Remote Control Car,"This car is HUGE. It is way bigger than we expected. Really it would be a better toy to use outdoors, unless you have a very spacious, open floor plan. We got two for our sons to race them. (The car is every bit of two feet long!) They have only opened one and it is very nice, but they are waiting til spring to open the other so they can play with them outside. They really are much, much larger than expected. So, if you are looking for a large remote controlled car, this is the one for you. It was a very good value for the size."
1,boring game ever,I got this last week and only lasted on it for 5 minutes and it's not what I expected boring. you ride your bike and soon you run out of energy then all the other racers run over you. And you only hardly can do to moves. Trust me' don't use your money on this worst game ever.
2,Promising concept poorly executed,"This book lacks substance. Sherry Smith draws conclusions on such a small amount of evidence that some of it is laughable. Some of her logic to arrive at her conclusions is also very suspect. Additionally, most everything interesting that you'd want to read in such a book, she only mentions in passing, telling the reader to look in her source books for more information. It would have been nice if you put it in your book to give it some substance. Overall, this is one of the worst books on the West I have ever read."
2,Old info and not a lot of detail,"I just bought this video and watched it. I would have been extremely disappointed if I would have paid $[...] for it. The info on this product shows a 2005 release date, but the video is actually from 2000. It is very non-specific in nature and really does not show you how to select good stocks or options. The indicators Price Headley shows have to be programmed into Tradestation or other sophisticated software and he refers to a book in the video that everyone in the audience has, but you don't have. The concepts are good, but anyone could have looked like a star during the internet stock bubble stock history that he refers to during 1998-2000. Heck I even tripled a few stocks. I question whether his concepts are even valid now. The video is also an infomercial for [...] more than anything else."
1,black pants,I did not like the pants. The pants were too long and I am very short person. I just was unhappy because the pants did not fit right.
1,NOT VISTA COMPATIBLE,"NOT VISTA COMPATIBLEI should have read the reviews.They will take it back, less a $4.50 restocking fee, I have to take Amazon credit. Oh well, I could have been out more $."
1,did not work with computer!,I have a windows 2000 professional that has been upgraded to a XP PROFESSIONAL. The files are not compatible with this software.
4,Fun for 2,"My girlfriend and I love playing cooperative games (project eden, baldur's gate) and this one was great fun for us. Basically you run a race against the clock in a vertical split screen. Your partner has to do things to allow you to continue and vica versa. It was great fun for a few short gaming sessions, I can't play it for very long however because I get bored for the formula."
4,This is an okay game!,Last time I wrote about this game is horrible! But not really if you get the hang of it. It takes time to beat other worlds play with a person that is not impatient and thats gets mad at you when you do something wrong it will make you get so nervous that you will lose even more. That happend to me once so you have to do teamwork and try your best not yelling at each other for making mistakes everyone makes mistakes. No one's perfect.
4,waited a long time to find this game,"got this as a gift and really like it. its not sold in regular stores anymore, so I was excited to finally get it!! Game works fine and got it in only a few days."
4,Kids love it!,"A very challenging game and brainwork for both players. One has to help the other get to the next by turning a switch and then the other will have to move a lever to let down a drawbridge for the opposite player etc. They HAVE to work together to get to the finish line! Only drawback is that it is repetitious if you run out of time, but the kids like it because they have each level memorized and can beat their times!"
4,cookie and cream rock!,i luv this game because my brother and I can both use the PS2 at the same time! plus the bunnies are soooooo cute! you can battle gators and evil tiki birds while having fun and working together. the roosters and hens help you along your journey to get the moon back in time for the moon festival. I also recomend ape escape 2.
1,This game stinks,"I recently played this game at a Game Show in Japan. I did not find this game fun at all!! The game has many ""old school"" games that you do not want to try after about 2 minutes of play!! I recommend that you wait to get another good game coming out or wait this fall and get xbox..."
5,Great Book I have read it at least 20 times,"Bryan Perrett is a good writer, most of his book I have read, however the one writing as “encyclopedia” are not a good as the book written from the military and Soldiers point of view, overall I will recommend most of his book for an informative and riveting historical reading."
3,SICK & TWISTED,"Watch out folks! This is one mean and NASTY flick! It starts out like a 'Paranormal Activity' clone with some SERIOUSLY SCARY moments (including a single scary shot that is really haunting) but eventually turns into a series of nasty serial killings recorded on video. The entire movie is shot in POV and it's about a guy who is trying to get evidence of a haunting in this creepy house. Without ruining the twist I'll just say that it's worth checking out ONLY if you are ready to see some very nasty kills that look like a faux sn*ff film.Unfortunately the FX are really bad which ruins the authenticity of some of the kill scenes but the ideas and the execution of the scenes are textbook examples of how to shock your audience with no budget. The main guy does tend to ramble on at times and is a bit obnoxious but thankfully the scenes of horror aren't too far apart. As long as you know what you're getting into you might like it, but it's also easy to understand why some may hate it."
4,A wonderfully written Story,"What a wonderful written story of a women's heartfelt quest to survivebeing a share croppers daughter from Louisiana. With nothing but adream Louella Daigle used her hard work ethics to peruse a life ofsuccess and also by chance landed her on her favorite game show ""Let's Make a Deal"". Louella was able to achieve more from life in spite ofher deep secret, which at times left her paralyzed with fear. I trulyenjoyed reading this story and felt it was inspirational, heartfelt anda example of how we can all use our natural talents to live life toit's fullest.Turning Pages Book Club"
2,Made in Taiwan ? Dah... :>{,"pictured sensor shows Italy engrave , this one does not have anymark on the sensor and box says made in taiwan $ 24.60 . just like what O'reily / kragen $ 21.99 . my old part is made by bosch oem , as mark .."
1,Synthesized dreck,"Why did the producers use synthesizers for this music? It's awful. It's possible to hook kids on classical music using the actual instruments written for it - that's how I got hooked. That's what Mel Blanc and Disney did in their cartoons, Bugs Bunny and Fantasia. I do NOT recommend this CD to anyone. It was a shower gift. If you are not familiar with classical music, then I recommend ""Baby Needs Beethoven"", which is a collection of music using real instruments (albeit shortened - no full length symphonies here)."
3,Good game but somewhat lacking....,Don't get me wrong...I enjoyed this game. After playing it for a while though it became the same thing over and over again. Two cities are not enough. Rent it first.
4,"Great, but needs work.","Yo, Wassup? MDawg here w/ another great review 4 ya.At first when i rented this game, i was really excited about it. I thought it'd b great (my friend had the Dreamcast version and I'm totally hooked on it). I have to admit though, it isn't as good as i thought it would b. Sure the game is pretty good, and so is the music, but it could still use some work.The gameplay could b a little bit longer, it isn't very fun, there's only 1 or 2 levels. But it's still o.k. So don't throw the game out the window if u play it 4 only 5min.All in all though, the game is allright."
4,One crazy ride!,"C for crazy!You can be 4 people.And do 2 modes.[Arcade and normal modes]You can drive,drive crazy,or.........ignore traffic rules,crash cars upsidedown,or make up your own rules!Another thing is you can drive and get customers in the water.This is a wierd yet fun game.Ya gotta buy it![NOW]"
4,Insane driver-caution,Hey if you have the need for speed then buy this game it has the best things you expect from a game like this one.
3,[Crazy Taxi],"Crazy Taxi is a great game on the Dreamcast, however on the PS2, the graphics aren't AWFUL but not quite as good, and there are no new features. However if you haven't played it on the DC, it wont disappoint"
2,It is just going to be a port,"To the person who said before that this game was going to be ""fantastic"" for PS2 because of ""New Characters"" and ""Better Graphics"" is dead wrong. The graphics on the dreamcast version really can't be improved. All that is going to be improved upon is the frame rate (the dc version was a little choppy in areas) and the amount of pop-up. This game has been out since February 2000. While it is a great game, don't expect much in the way of improvements. We'll all just have to wait for CT2 on Dreamcast."
3,fun but.......,"this game is fun, but it doesn't go anywhere. if you like quick games, this one is great."
3,Not Worth Your Money..,"Ok call me a hypocrite, i bought this game neglecting the negative reviews. There just isn't much replay value in this game, you'll be hard-pressed to play this for more than 2 hours. The load times aren't long at all, but the graphics and pop-up are very irritating. The concept behind this game is brilliant, however the experience (and the price) isn't worth it."
2,what?,this game might be fun at the arcade but it sucks at home. this is one of the most boring games i've ever played.it is still better than nothin.
1,Full of bugs,"Be very careful when buying this game. If this is what we have to look forward to from Dreamcast ports, then we're in for a lot of trouble. What's wrong with this game? Where to start?- There is a major pop in problem. Sometime, it's so bad, you can't see the street just in front of you.- The street is frequently not there at all. Just the car in blue ""air"". Sometimes, turning a 360 will fix it.- The music usually plays for between two and ten seconds, then stops. When it gets bad, two or three notes will loop for 30 seconds.Yipes! These problems make the game totally unplayable. I don't recommend buying this game, yet. I hope they recall the garbage they've shipped, fix it and rerelease it. Then, it'll be one of the funnest games yet for the PS2.If you've read great reviews of this game, they're from people who haven't played this PS2 port."
5,THIS IS GOING TO BE THE SWEET GAME FOR YOU!!,CRAZY TAXI IS FOR THE DREAMCAST BUT NOW THANK THE SONY GODS IT GOING TO BE ON THE PS2!! I BET THIS IS GOING TO BE AN AWSOME ARCADE GAME IN THE WORLD I MEAN LIKE YOU CAN GO CRAZY DRIVING GO OFF ROAD IN SAN FRANCISCO!! CALIFORNIA AND WOULD BE A EASY GAME TO PLAY FOR EVERYONE!!
1,Dumbest game you'll ever play,There is absolutly no point in this game. Don't make the mistake I did in buying this game. All you do is drive around in a stupid cab and pick people up and drive like an [nut] to their destination. You will not like this game.
3,Crazy Taxi or not so crazy taxi,"Crazy Taxi is a good game. It's just that it's not realistic. I rented the game for 3 nights and I realised that I wasted 2.50, which I could have used to rent Timesplitters or Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. If you crave smashing every single telephone booth and car you see, then buy it. If you don't, then do not spend your money on it."
2,"No, Just no.","I played this at my friend's house a while ago, and after a couple of minutes, I was begging to play another game. This game just doesn't work. It's boring, the graphics aren't good, and the storyline does not have much in it. Despite these bad features, this game can get very fun during free ride. Have fun driving around like a maniac while smashing into stuff. Back to the bad stuff. This game isn't half as good as a game that is very similar to it-Smuggler's Run. Smuggler's Run has better graphics, better gameplay, better story line, and is just more fun. I'm sorry SEGA and Aklaim, but I had to give Crazy Taxi 2/5."
3,Kind of Dull!,I tired of this game after only a few times playing it. It's a great game for rental but I wouldn't buy it if I were you. The game gets very repetitive after only a few times playing it.
3,"Fun, But Not For Long.","I really enjoyed the game, but I felt once again it suffered from a repeated flaw of PS2's first generation of games. It was too short and offered candy for the eyes, but no variety for the brain. The game is a lot of fun. In fact, family members who don't even like gaming really enjoyed the experience and played for long stretches. Unfortunately, the game tops out. While all games eventually do, this game seem to do so early. Perhaps because it is the clone of the arcade, so it lacks the sophistication that home users desire. But I liked this game, but I quickly became bored along with the non-gamers in the home. My suggestion is if you want a car game, go get Twisted Metal: Black. If violence is an issue stay here and buy this, it is fun."
4,Four and a half really,"Crazy Taxi is a must have for everyone,kids,adults,teens.I borrowed this game from a friend and I love it.I plan to buy it in the future.It has lots of modes.(Arcade,Original,Crazy Box).Arcade is like an exhibition mode,Original is like an adventure mode,Crazy Box is a great minigame.It is easy to pick up and play.It is great to play with friends,even though there is no multiplayer,take turns at arcade to see who can earn the most cash.Here is what is good about Crazy Taxi:Great graphics,fun for more than one person,great modes,great fun for a while.Now what is bad:no official multiplayer,not enough modes,becomes repetitive after a while.Still overall a good game,hopefully Sega will improve the cons and make Crazy Taxi2 an absolute must have."
3,A fun and exciting game!!,"Crazy Taxi is a great game for excitement.The graphics are good and the customers' comments are funny.But there are some things that aren't so great about this game.There is only one location in the game, San Francisco.And the area isnt that big.Also, it gets boring really fast.After a few runs you get sick of the game.Overall the game is ok."
1,Extremely buggy,"The game is buggy ... . I played it 3 times, and all 3 times it locked up to the point where i had to shut off the console unit and start it back up again. Also, the graphics disappear while your playing and you can't see where you're going. Great job in the quality assurance lab my Acclaim!!! DO NOT BUY"
3,rent unless you are a driving fan,"this game is fun but seriously repetitive. ive only had it 2 days and i can see it wont be something ill be glad to play everyday, but don't get me wrong, it is a good game. just not something to own, unless you are a driving game fan."
1,Too many bugs... this shouldn't have been released,"We waited a long time for this game to come to PS2. Who cares if it's just like Dreamcast... we don't have that console. But like several others have reported, this game is WAY too buggy to have been released, and I'm ashamed of Acclaim for taking money from consumers for an unfinished game. The road disappears constantly, which screws up your ability to play properly, and the game froze and had to be restarted twice within the first half hour of playing. It pretty much kills the potential of any fun this game could deliver. We'll be returning ours..., and I'd advise anyone to wait until these problems are fixed before making a purchase."
1,Acclaim should be ashamed...,"Poor, poor, poor!!! How many glitches can you fit in one game? Disappearing roads, freezes, poor sound...either it's a defective copy or they just couldn't get it right. But I'm not the only one that this has happened to, many other people have complained about the exact same things. These problems should not be happening at this level. I'm sure Acclaim had people fired for such a pitiful showing. I'll be exchanging my copy today."
3,Shoul never have left the arcades,"Crazy Taxi is not really for consoles-its for arcade machines.This game is actually LESS realistic than the PS1 game ""DRIVER"" as no matter how hard your Taxi NEVER gets a dent.I Remember the first time i saw this game in an arcade with my cousin Breege,we played it and i was thinking it was like GTA:Vice City as you were in this city and could knock over any car you like(however in GTA you can do MUCH MORE) but pedestriens just bounce out the way which annoys me about old driving games(In CT they jump,In Driver they rather run or glitch through your car).bye"
2,Just didn't do it,"Again, another failed attempt at a racing game. Crazy Taxi gets boring really quickly and then you really have no where else to go and you end up bringing this one to your local Funcoland or Game Stop and trade it in for something else.The graphics are excellent and for the 5 minutes that it lasts, the game is fun but as soon as that 5 minutes is up, I wouldn't count on anything else to expect in this game.When will they come out with a racing game similar to Road Rash? Atleast in Road Rash, there's a lot more competition and you actually have to deal with the elements and environment around you. I can recall several times where I just drove across a park to get where I needed to go. Again, not very fun and an unfortunate thumbs down."
5,great game,this game is fun and hillarious. This is the game to buy. If you want to beat the game get Prima's guide.
4,"It's Pretty Fun, Although it gets boring after a while","Crazy Taxi is a fun game, however there is a lot of glitches. I tested this game out on my friends Ps2 and my Ps2, there is stil glitches. Sometimes when u are driving down the road the whole street turns black or completely blue. In other words you can't see where the hell you are going. It has some pretty cool mini-games."
4,_,"Good. Owners of the great hype box can finally play a REAL game. Well, I'm just going to play Crazy Taxi 2 on my Dreamcast now. Sayonara."
3,Good but not Great,"As an owner of Crazy Taxi as of May 16th, I have some bad things to say about it. I bought it the day it came out and I couldn't be more disappointed. It locks up constantly (in 1 hour it locked up 7 times, each time it needed to be reset). Also, at times, the course (road, landmarks and walls) disappear, leaving you in a cloud of sparks and your passenger screaming at you. Now, you may be thinking after saying all these things that i might rate it terribly, but I haven't. Even with all this, it is still a fun and addictive game. If you love the arcade and DC game before this you will still enjoy this one. If for nothing else, this will whet your desire for Crazy Taxi 2 coming out later this summer for PS2."
5,"A ""must read"" to any class!",Mr. Wartik has crafted a great book! The Vonnesta Project is fantastic! It is a page turner for young and old. I could not put this book down. The characters are well developed and the story moves along at a perfect pace. What a treat to read. I can not wait to use The Vonnesta Project in the classroom. I eagerly await the next installment of this amazing series. Well Done! ~Beth Kern
5,One I will read over and over again; my kids love it!,"Wartik has crafted a fine book in the pages of The Vonnesta Project. I'm reading it to my own group of fourth graders and they can't wait for me to read it to them each day. This book is ideal for a class read aloud, but is also a fun read for anyone who enjoys mysterious and enchanting work. The chapters are written in such a way that the readers want to keep turning to find out more about this mysterious disovery. This book has some elements of fiction that faintly remind me of the feel of J.K. Rawlings and Lemony Snickett, but with a more grounded, American tone. I highly recommend this book and personally can't wait to read the next installment of the Vonnesta Project!"
1,Horrible!,"Screen protectors may seem a good idea to use, but I think it's not worth it. Unless put on perfectly, one may find air bubbles on the screen, even with the help of a ""Soft Card"". If one manages to put on correctly, however, more force is needed to activate the touch screen. These slips may reflect light a little too much, making it harder to see, and when used, the little marks from the stylus will contribute to an even harder to see screen. It's a very sticky mess, so if you do buy it, put it on with care, because it is very hard to get off again. Not reccomended. If you don't want your screen to scratch, take good care of it, because these won't help."
1,Pelican DS accesory review by CWW,As many people have said... there is gunk left all over your ds screen after leaving the top screen protector on... this really made me mad! i was thinking this was going to be a nice kit but it turned out it ruined my ds screen! If you do get this kit dont use the top protector!!! the bottom one is fine though... The two game cases are kind of nice because they hold 3 GBA games and 3 DS games. There are also ear head phones and a cloth which they both work fine... The two stylus's that come with it are big and cant fit in your ds which to me seems kind of worthless... But overall if you do get this dont use the screen protector!!!!!
1,Huge Piece of Bull****!!!!!!!!!,"This is quite possibly the worst accsesory ever. The top screen protector is fine, but after you put on the bottom screen part, guess what? Air packets!!!!!! I didn't touch the bottom screen protector, and air packets air packet air packets!!!!!!!! This product sucks!"
1,The worst accessory,"This is by far the worst accessory you could put on your DS. The bottom screen looks grainy when applied and like some of you said, when you try to peel them off, you get a mess all over the screen and the soft card makes scratches to the protector. Please do yourself a favor and buy the Hori ones. It's a much better product."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Sure this item may sound like a good investment, but it's not! When you first put it on the screen has to be completely smudge and dust free, if it's not it will just make it worse. Then when you take it off it leaves adhesive all over the edges. I strongly suggest to avoid this accesory"
1,Absolutely horrible!!!!!!!!,"I got this because i had some extra money left over for buying my DS. I was putting them on and the ""soft"" card thing they give scratch it the moment i put the things on!! So after awhile i decided it's just attracting dirt and it not worth it so i take them off... WHAT!! It leaves a stick residue. on my screen. I took them off probably two months ago and i still haven't been able to get the stuff off.DO NOT BUY THE ITEM. YOU ARE BETTER OFF WITH YOUR SCREEN BARE."
1,bad screen protector,This screen protector distorts with a rainbow effect.You're better off getting the Nintendo Licensed ones made by Hori for under $10.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY THIRD PARTY STLUS PENS,"I actually bought the 2 pack pelican metallic ones for 4.99, but it's the same thing. The thing looks really cool and stylish, fits in the ds nicely but that's about it. But what I didn't know when I bought it is that the tip is finer than the ds one, making it VERY prone to scratches in a matter of months or even weeks depending how often you play and how much the game requires a stylus. Stick to the OFFICIAL Nintendo one no matter how cool looking 3rd party stylus pens are!"
2,You get what you pay for.,"I'll be short and simple. There's no need to protect the top screen, unless you carry your DS around open and in a bag full of knives and keys. The bottom screen protector was rather inconvenient to put on. It's no the company's fault if their product gets air bubbles, but the soft card didn't help. It got rid of some bubbles around the edges, but if you happen to get one in the middle of the screen, you're wasting your time. I also had a bit of trouble removing the bottom protector, as the screen is inset in the system, but once again, not really their fault. Overall, this is a cheap screen protector. Take that as a good or bad thing if you want. It's better than saran wrap, but worse than the Hori protectors. So if you have the money to spend, it's best to stay away from this.And for the fun factor: Are screen protectors supposed to be fun?"
2,Don't waste your time...,Don't waste your time reading and preparing for the test using this book. It is very basic and not thorough at all. The test engine is weak and the book chapters are not on the CD. I suggest reading the Sybex title on A+ certification.
4,Terrific resource,"This book is definitely a ""cut through the chase"" kind of A+ prep book. As several other reviewers pointed out, you'll certainly become certified upon completion of this book. However, if you don't have any experience with PC Hardware and Operating Systems, I recommend Mike Myers A+ Passport to learn the concepts from a different perspective. I couldn't believe how accurate the contents really were. It receives four stars because of the numerous errors in the quiz software. If you know your stuff, then the errors aren't a problem other than your electronic ending score isn't accurate but, for Newbies to the A+ endeavor, it could confuse one..."
3,I think it's out dated!,It's will teach things about msdos... I don't think you will get msdos questions in A+. Watch out about it!
1,A great way to void your warranty quickly,"Opening that battery compartment invites one thing - disaster. As soon as you do that, your warranty with the SP is out the window. Also if you don't know what you're doing, you can damage your machine very quickly. The SP gives you 20 hours of play on one charge if you don't use the backlight, and 10 if you do. A battery that advertises being good for only 10 hours is bound to get less then that. Also, why would you need another battery? You can always get a car adapter if you're going on a long road trip, and you always have a home one for home charging. All in all, this is the worst accessory I ever saw Intec come out with! AVOID at all costs!"
4,A Portrait of a Cellist,"I decided to read this book, because I'm a young cellist myself. Or I want to be. So I must say that I like this book a lot just because it's about cellists and music. But I also like it otherwise. It isn't just a biography of someone. We hear also Noras's thoughts, ideas and so on. What he thinks about the world of music in which he has been living for - well, almost all his life. It doesn't tell everything about the artist, doesn't have lots of numbers or lists about what Noras has done, but that doesn't matter. I recommend ""Arto Noras, sello"" to everyone who is interested about cellists and classical music. A book which tells about a person can be boring, this isn't. It isn't too long, either. It isn't actually like a novel, sometimes it even has the same thoughts in different pages. It's more like real life, that way."
5,Go with Rick!,"If I could bring only two guides to France with me this year, one of them would certainly be Rick Steves' France 2006. the other would be a very good street map of Paris, where I'll be staying most of the time. Rick's reviews are excellent, giving specifics and details without going overboard on flowery, vague descriptions."
5,Wonderful companion to Bhagavad Gita,Osho's spirit of sharp discernment sheds yet more light on the Gita's first few essential chapters. If you are a student and devotee of lord Krishna or a disciple in search of a text ghat illumines --- read this!
4,a good product,Reasonable protection and a good size.perfect for carrying shotguns while travelling.and plus the value is good too
4,Good case for the money.,"If you don't mind the trouble of engaging and disengaging the barrel this case can save a lot of trunk and closet space. Just like one of other reviewers mentioned this case is 36"" long. Fits broken down Mossberg or Remington 870 with no problem. The styrofoam inserts could be a bit thicker but still do the trick holding the contents tight. Two front-side latches combined with two more on the sides hold the closed case intact. It locks pretty well leaving minor gap behind the handle. Overall, it's a good case for the price."
5,Good product for a fair price,"I have read tons of reviews on Amazon when deciding on a product and I think now its my turn to pitch in.I just got this Plano gun case in the mail and i think it is great for the money. I was just looking for a hard case to protect my O/U when it wasn't in the safe and this fits the bill. Sure you can get a nicer aluminum model, but it will cost you 3-4 times the money for the same purpose. I will however say that although they state it is airline approved I would buy a better case if I was taking my gun somewhere. Since I am only going to the range 10 miles away this case is a good buy."
2,Standard case,"Not so impressed with this case. Once you place your shotgun in it (20 ga), it does not close properly leaving sizable gap for air & elements in. It has nothing to do with the foam/shotgun, it's the plastic model of the case itself that does not fit properly.I went for a less expensive case because the airlines treat all cases the same."
4,PLANO TAKE DOWN GUN CASE,"THE PLANO TAKE DOWN GUN CASE IS A VERY GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY. THE ONLY SHORTCOMING IS, WHEN THE CASE IS CLOSED DOWN WITH THE SHOT GUN IN IT, SOMETIMES ONE OF THE CLOSING CLIPS ON THE CASE POPS OFF. IT EASILY GOES BACK ON, BUT IT IS A LITTLE TIME CONSUMING. AMAZON IS THE BEST PLACE TO BUY IT........."
3,Flimsy but functional,"Really cheaply made but functional. The plastic case is really flimsy, the ""piano hinges"" are a joke. Only the foam protects your gun, not the case. If you need a sturdy case, better pass on this one. However, if you just need a case to get back and forth to the range then it might be worth a look. I considered sending it back, but ended up keeping mine simply because I only go to the range to shoot trap and then back home."
3,Cheap but works.,Plastic is very flimsy but what do you expect for under 50 dollars. It tends to bow out around the handle.
3,"Economy case,but worth the cost","Inexpensive gun case that works well except fot the ""pillar"" in the middle,restricting many gun fitments. My SS Mini 14 with folding stock fits OK but the High Standard Police Model 10 Bull Pup won't fit around it at all. Go with the better all weather case from Plano if you want the best."
3,Missing Pecies,"Great case for the money, although it came with no pins in the hinges. Cut up a coat hanger to fix but still a hassle."
4,Consider the price,"For the price, this is a good case. For comparison, I have some Flambeau full-size ones that are about the same quality outer case, much worse foam inside, and were slightly cheaper. My biggest complaint is the lock holes: instead of being near the handle as on similar cases, there is one on each end, and you have to lock both--locking just one leaves enough flexibility to the plastic that you can reach in and get the gun out (obviously not a problem if all you're doing is using this to keep the dust out). Would otherwise work well for an over/under shotgun, though I use mine for a Kel-Tec SU-16 perfectly."
5,AR15 Case,This case was a perfect fit for my Stag Model 3 AR15. No mods or cutting required to the case. Very compact AR case.
5,Excellent product!,This product was in excellent shape and my niece used it with ease! It arrived in a timely fashion. Nothing but satisfied.
4,Jt sprocket,Awesome ... Exactly what I was looking for. Sprocket got here fast and was exactly what I ordered. Would buy from here again.
2,don't waste your time,"this game is fun for a couple of days, but then it gets boring because your car is faster than anyones else's car."
3,It's hard to have fun at 70 mph,The idea for this game is good. The finshed product is not. First off even with upgrades your car goes at least half as fast as your rivals. Another thing is that there really isn't enough track to race on and the ones they give you can also get boring. I liked the idea of upgrading my car but it just didn't work out very well. Some nice graphics but this game is very good overall. Try Gran Turismo 3 or Midnight Run instead.
3,Great game with fast boredom rate,"Others who have reviewed this game have raved over it - with good reason. The graphics are excellent, the sound is superb, and the handling of the cars is wonderful. Best of all, load times are extremely quick for the amount of visual detail included in the game.However, after about a week with this game, I found my interest level dropping rapidly. Less than a week later, I sold off the game. Part of this was due to the frustration of the Wanderers; when you encounter them and challenge them, they will always turn you down, but on their own schedule - and I have yet to see any information published on what determines this schedule - the Wanderers will come to challenge you. I have also received e-mails from many other players frustrated over this.If your interest level stays high, great. If not, the ..investment will be rather disappointing. At least Gran Turismo 3 is about to be released"
4,Picking The Right Game,"If you have been to the movies to see The Fast and The Furious.If you liked that been you will like this game.It is just like that you get to race,put over a hundred new parts in your car and race for money."
3,ambivalent,"The graphics are good and there are plenty of fun ways to modify the cars, but the actual racing is not as fun as other games I've played, such as midnight club."
4,Pretty good,"This game is a worthy purchase...lots of rivals to race and cars to customize. Graphics are descent as well as the in-game music. If you enjoyed Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3, then you will enjoy this one as well."
5,The Game is Great,The game is the best game because you can race different street gangs to win money to customize your car(s). You can customize your car with everything from engine parts to headlight and aero dyanamic parts.
2,"Great if you have the Logitech Steering Wheel; if not, yikes","The scenery is boring and the soundtrack is a huge yawn but it is satisfying if you have the capatible steering wheel. Unfortunately, if suffers in comparison to Gran Tourismo 3. If you do not plan to use it with the steering wheel...just rent it if you feel the need."
5,DA BEST GAME,THIS GAME IS AMAZING U WILL NEVER GET BORED THE CARS R NICE LOOKING AND I HOPE THERE WILL BE A NEXT TOKYO XTREME RACER
1,IT didnt work,I got a PS2 and my mom couldnt find Smackdown 3 so she got me this....it didnt work...but that might have been because it was used
1,Save Your Money,"This game was enjoyable for the first two hours and then its fun factor quickly went down hill. It is far too complicated to figure out the right combination of car, color, license plate, etc that is needed to race the different groups. For Japanese street racing geeks that is probably their idea of great fun, but it's not mine. I regret buying this game."
4,Cult classic,"A friend and i rented this game a long time ago... a really long time ago sense i used the phrase ""rented this game"". we played it all night, did some awesome racing and car mods. about a month later i found it for sale and it was mine. i didnt play it much after that until i broke my shoulder and couldnt do anything for a month, except play video games. i logged days not hours but days into this. lots of fun and still time to time ill fire up the ol ps2 and give it a go."
3,Game of it's years.,"This game was awesome in its time but comparing this game to the games offered today, it's something that an average gamer wouldn't want to jump into."
5,Best Racing Game Ever (Better Than Gran Turismo And Heres Why),"The TXR series is one of a kind, this game started the free roam race. What other game has the hottest tuner cars (parts too), 200 virtual miles of tokyo highway, and seemingly endless amount of rivals? Only TXR it's really a shame this game has'nt gotten the shine it deserves, this game reminds of when games were fun, not boring objective ridden programs. A big plus is that it's way more accessible than GT4, meaning that you can just jump into this game and start racing, rather than finding which races your car qualifies for. Sure the graphics arent great and the physics arent the best, but for overall fun, this game is a definite must-own classic for any serious, passionate racer in your family or circle. If you're a motor head and dont own this game and/or it's predecessors along with GT4 than you are'nt a motorhead, you should just kill yourself. BUY IT!!!!!"
4,Great Game,"In every sense. My only complaint is of the depth of screen, sometimes it's difficult to see upcoming turns in time, though it's partially due to the fact that you're only racing at night...."
4,it's ight,"a very good game except the speed points which are pointless and annoying in all but one way, they keep the race short and sweet. I love the different ways to hook-up ya car. tha dvd extras are pretty sweet too."
5,hard core racer,"The GoodGraphicsRealistic (Much like GT)Plenty of cars (even those not avaible in the US like the Skyline GTR R34)Customize your own carThe BadFingers hurt from playing too longNot enough modifications for your car (compared to the real world)The UglyRoads seem too wideThe bystanders switch lanes into youStart with only 15,000 dollars and can't seem to save money since you waste so much making your car look goodI'll admit that if you did not enjoy GT, RR or Midnight Racing, this is not the game for you. However, if you love japanese cars or love racing games, this is the perfect game for you"
5,Tokyo Extreme Racer Pro Or Con?,"Now i have been around the block a few times on Ps2 games and by far the best racing game i found was this one, and i have never regretted buying it. with the nice turning attributes(not found in grand turismo games where turning is a chore) this game will rock the streets. Unlike games like grand turismo, it speciallizes on the outside appearance of the cars,not the inside, which is a big pro.(what is so great about changing spark plugs,anyway?) the lighting is very detailed, and the racing is endless, so why wouldn't you want this game? the only downfall i see is the fact that the music litterally sucks, besides that, buy this game"
5,THE BEST FOR THE MONEY,"well, i'll break it down is two parts for you guys.PROS.YOU GET TO BUY,RACE,SELL,TWEK,& MAKE YOUER CAR THE BEST ON THE TOKYO HIGHWAYS.ADJUSTABLE CONTROLS HELPS YOU SET YOURE OWN CUSTOM STEARING,REPLAY VALUE:YOU'L PLAY IT EVERY NOW & THEN,BUT IT'S STILL A COOL GAME.CONS.NOT THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD GRAFICLY,BUT HEY IT'S WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN THE DREAMCAST VERSION.ALL IN ALL IT'S NOT BAD FOR THE AMOUNT THATS WHY I'M GIVIG IT FIVE STARS,BECAUSE FOR THAT PRICE DONT EXPECT TO SEE GRAND TARISUMO OR SOMETHING!"
3,Just another game,"It was ok, but only for driving around. There's nothing special about it. It's not like a lot of racing games like midnight club or San Francisco Rush, where the game pace is fast, it's kind of just cruising around. And it's too realistic. It's hard to make turns and there are not very many crazy shortcuts with ramps and stuff. Plus, there's not to many places to race. I personaly think that midnight club is a better game."
4,"Good game with solid graphics, but limited roads to race on","This game is pretty good as far as racing goes. The cars look good and the surrounding city skyline looks pretty good also. The upgrades are awsome at first but after you buy everything available you still find yourself getting beaten by faster cars. I worked hard to build the car that I drive, but now I need to sell it and start from scratch to compete with the big boys. Not a bad game, I just was expecting more. Looking forward to GT3!"
2,car,"antenna adapter did work but has a veary poor fit i am a ASE certified mechanic so i now my way around a car and it's wireing , not shure if i would buy this product again."
1,cheap quality not worth the asking price,"I bought the Honda-Black Chrome ABS snap caps and they are made with really cheap quality, they are plastic and the sticker of the H logo seems really fake you can see the outline of the sticker, don't buy this one. I also bought the valve stems caps, same thing not worth the asking price, i put it one tightly on the valve and some of the cheap ""chrome"" started peeling of the cap.lesson learned"
5,Velvet Bond,"Bad choice the heroine made, that got her marry to the Hero, which the Hero didn't take that pretty well but they made it work."
5,Best Derivatives Book I Have Ever Used,I find it hard to believe that anyone would find this book difficult to follow or undertand. I have been teaching derivatives at the graduate finance level for 13 years and have never seen a better book. Most of the books I have reviewed are useless as a teaching tool. They tend to be nothing more than one writer/professor showing his colleagues how smart he is. I could not recommend this book more for anyone needing a solid introduction to derivatives.
4,Good!,"Bought these for my extra Wusthof Grand Prix ii steak knives that would be in my drawer. They are very long, much longer than the knives, but I don't mind. A little hard to get in, but I don't mind because they mostly just sit in the drawer. They offer good protection."
2,Not for small places,"I got this about a year ago.First of all I have a lot of radio controled cars,like eleven,so I would know if this is any good.its got good range so you shouldn't worry about that.Its a fast little car,it goes way faster than my microsizer but its not manuverable [I mean,thats why I wanted get a small car]so you should probably get a microsizer instead.So in conclusion,if you dont care about driving it in small places like on tables and stuff it would be ok for you.But then you should get a bigger car anyway."
4,Apron,nice quality but the pockets are a little small if you have big hands. convenient for you tools and tape measure
5,Two Eagles in the Sun,"Campbell does a great job offering concise information about Mexican Culture as it is related to the USA and Latin America. He offers insight for the Borderlands and the interior. This book is like the ""Cliffs Notes"" of Mexico. For a fast and easy-to-read book filled with information about issues such as: Battles, Holidays, Economy, History of the Country, Impact of NAFTA, Attitudes of Mexican People, etc.This is a great reference tool that you will want on your bookshelf for a long time. It offers the nuts and bolts of the issues and you do not have to read all night to find the scoop on the situation. For further reading, the appendix and bibliography is great."
1,Scrolling Pinball Game,"For a new game, you would think no more scrolling. WRONG. This game is slow, scrolls the entire screen, and a big loss. If you like pinball, you have to get ProPinball games by Empire, they rock."
2,Don't expect 'Pro Pinball'.,"I've never played the PC version by On Deck Interactive but, I've heard people talk about this game who have and apparently this version doesn't live up to the PC. The goods as I see them...The playfield is great. The layout has plenty to hit yet not crowded. Sound effects are fine but not outstanding. You can play your KISS CDs while playing the game (way cool). Two playfields instead of one. The music is not bad enough to gripe about. Very inexspensive (always a plus). The bads...You get what you've paid for. The flippers have a lag, as if the jets are worn. The ball plays like a pachinco machine with flippers, or the shop owner set the machine level at a 75 degree angle. Hard to catch the ball. The painting on the first playfield makes it hard to visually track the ball. I miss the Turbo-Grafx pinball game Devils Crush.... The next time KISS authorizes a static pinball simulator, they should go to Empire Interactive. Thanks."
2,Maybe it's worth [less money].,"This game isn't very good. You get two boards of Kiss themed pinball. The worst part of this game is the ball control. The balls drop much too fast, making it hard to get any control. You basicly spend the whole game just flipping the flippers in hopes you'll hit the ball before it quickly drops to the bottom screen and past your flippers. The sound isn't very good either. Not much in the way of Kiss songs or sound effects. The manual even tells you to put your favorite Kiss CD in the playstation after the games loads. Don't confuse this game with an old favorite of mine for the Sega Genesis, Crue Ball, based on Motley Crue. That pinball game was great. I guess you get what you pay for and this game may be worth [the money]for a few rounds of pinball."
3,Not very good... but the price is great!,"Well, it's NOT a very good camera. The optics are blurry at the edges; the flash produces bizarre yellow-colored results; the user interface to the few features is rage-inducing; the interface to the computer is a primitive TWAIN, which means that you can't use Windows XP's built-in Camera tools...But it's hard to beat 59 bucks."
1,Description Misleading!! Poor Technical Support!! <1 Star,"After reading about this product being an excellent Christmas toy gift idea in a PC magazine, we decided to buy this item for a 9 year old. This product does not take video. What the erroneous description for the product means is that you make a video using software. The result is a choppy AVI file produced from still pictures you take while repeatedly pressing the camera trigger button. I'm guessing at this since we could not make more than a 1 second (a couple of frames) choppy video..."
3,"WIDE. But well made, good looking","I have narrow feet, but can usually can pull velcros tight enough. This shoe has the Velcro on top of fabric, therefore I can't pull these tight enough. I did not return, I wear with socks (I know a BIG no-no). Would not buy from this company again due to the sizing. I like Teva or Keen for my narrow feet."
4,Almost as Good...,"Shawn Mcdonalds ""Ripen"" is an album that soothes the ears and the soul. The lyrics are very real and you can tell he very much draws on personal experience with his songwriting.I do agree with one other reviewer who claims that Shawns songs all have the same kind of sound. Although, I dont think thats a bad thing. The album isnt all over the place. It gives it a sense of unity. Its a very calm album, with only a couple being more upbeat.I gave this album 4 stars, which I really think four and a half is a more proper rating. ""Simply Nothing"" one of Shawns other albums is my favorite of his. However, either album is well worth the money."
3,Ripe and ready,Shawn is becoming a great songwriter. I think his musicianship gets better each album. Shawn really helps me focus on my need for GOD. Personally I like his live albums better than his studio. But I bought this one and thought I would review it.
5,wonderful listening,"This is a wonderful album, every song is smooth, enticing and easy to listen to. This is a wonderful singer the whole album is sexy."
2,How do the Braves do it? Only vague answers here.,"This was a really good idea for a book, but it just doesn't deliver. Aside from the general annoyance of the cheap publishing and frequent typos, this book has no real structure or overarching argument ... if you read the last couple chapters you get more out of it than if you waste your time reading the whole thing. It's basically a mixture of biographies of everyone in the Braves organization and the author paraphrasing the words of others indiscriminately.I am a huge admirer of the Braves organization and their genius, so I was disappointed to not glean very much info about their magic in this book. Every once in a while there is a real gem about the Braves' philosophies, but just reading the life story of Steve Avery teaches me nothing. The book gets pretty repetitive with this and much of it is skippable.The Braves are an excellent foil to ""Moneyball."" This book certainly isn't."
3,interesting,"just like money ball this books will keep you around the scouting process for a major league team, too useful for people connected with this world."
1,Terrible Book,"This book was a waste of money. Nothing insightful at all. Shanks sounds like he is nothing more then a wannabe General Manager, that never amounted to anything other than a small time journalist. Scouts Honor was not only a waste of money, but a waste of time."
2,Enlightenment on traditional scouting,"I read this book and assumed it would be an answer to Moneyball, and in some ways it was. But the best description I saw was in an earlier review. If you read the first 4-7 chapters to get a history and an overview of the scouting program, as well as 1 or 2 of the scouting stories on prospects, you get the idea. Then skip to the end and read the last 2 chapters. If that was all the book was, then it would been a fascinating read. But as a competitor to moneyball, it doesnt hold a candle to the book in general.First, moneyball was well written. This book could've been a compilation of a home schooled sophmore in high school research and writing course. Moneyball actucally has flow, and tells stories differently. Scout's honor tells the same story over and over.Here's my suggestion. Buy the book, read the first 10 chapters and the last 2, and then return it."
2,"good, but see if you can find it cheap and with added warranty","I bought this product at Sam's Club. I purchased an added 3 year warranty (great decision). I purchased this so i could hook my macbook into the back of it and have my sound come out of the speakers. a day after the 1 year manufacturer warranty expired, the right side speaker started popping, but only with the computer, and any other external input for that matter. I called them and they said ""theres nothing we can do you are out of the warranty. They said ""its probably the inputs. they must have gone bad but you will have to take it to a repair shop to see what the problem is."" luckily, purchased the added warranty and Sam's club will replace it for free."
1,iSymphony M2,"Wish I had read these reviews before buying.... The CD/DVD on my unit died merely days after the 1 year warranty. Perfect!Don't make the same mistake! I paid $150--for me, a considerable expense.Micro DVD System w/iPod Docking"
2,pocket diagnoses book,"Yes, I know it's intended for doctors... but it is totallly technical language. (I expected something like a pocket Mercks manual.) I bought it for a friend about to enter Med. School and I don't think it was quite what he expected either."
1,Honda CRV 2012,It does not work for Honda CRV 2012 even though it comes up in search. I sent it back and was very disappointed.
3,So So,The piece itself has all you need to get setup with your trailer lights. The piece that hangs outside is flimsy and can bend/break quite easily. I make a point of keeping inside the car when not in use but it still gets considerable wear while in use.
2,Not what i needed,This is not the proper wiring harness for the 2008 oddyssey as advertised the port is on one side of the van and the exit to the outside or storage is on the other product works just not good for this application.
5,Easy connections and works well!,"Very easy to install,,,,just plug it in. Very simple and much better than splicing wires. I would recommend this product!"
5,quality product,"I purchased this to mate with a curt hitch and let me tell you it went together like a charm I was a little hesitant at first, but the insructions are very clear and concise. After installation, I pulled back and was quite impressed. A superb product and it fits with zero modifications or splicing. Used the following day to pull a new harley with a rented trailer, all lights working, even when setting the alarms. A must have."
4,Vicks Health Check Monitor,This is a very nice product. It is a great night stand gadget as well. We purchased it specifically to monitor our room environment for our new born son. Our apartment is one that tends to hold humidity and we did not want him to experience poor air quality. The plus side as well is that it helps me to keep my allergies in check as well. I really like the easy reference graph under the read out....no guess work.
3,xp problem,I use XP Pro and it does not recognize the X63 each time I reboot. Most of the time I have to reinstall to print. Great printer but compatibility problem with XP.
5,Kenn Chipkin's Books Are Excellent,"Chipkin's books are excellent and detailed guides to various guitar styles. Unlike a lot of genre guides, these are not ""dumbed down.""This book, Blues/Rock Guitar U.S. to U.K. appears to be the same or similar to ""Real Rock Guitar"" by the same author."
4,Good!,This Audio CD is good! It presents beautiful musical encounter of two great artists Johnny Mathis and Henry Mancini.This Audio CD is good! It presents beautiful musical encounter of two great artists Johnny Mathis and Henry Mancini.
1,Not enough depth into the subject.,Vendors mentioned are not in business now. The topics are way to generic. He doesn't even own his own business and I still had so many questions after reading this book. I don't ususally comment on books but felt there were other books out there which provided more insight.
1,Too general,There was not enough information as far as I was concerned. I think there are other books out there that are more specific and contain far more information.
1,Never recieved,I would like to review this product but I never recieved it. Quite a disappiontment considering it was a Christmas present
1,Not what I expected,"In selecting this book, I indicated I wanted a book about bicycling in Germany and Austria. I did not manage to get a thorough look at the index, but saw some rivers & towns mentioned and assumed that the book would cover the area that I was interested in.... it does not!"
2,Comments,"I haven't been on my trip yet, but I was looking for some places in the book that I didn't find. I was a little disappointed. There are better travel guides out there I'm sure."
2,probably better for novice travelers,"I am an experienced traveler and probably shouldn't have bought this book. The maps are inadequate and annoying, I found his narration patronizing, and he assumes that cities he didnt want to see you won't want to either. I want a guide book that will tell me about the places I want to go, this one is for people who want to be told where to go.However, the restaurant and hotel reviews are useful."
5,Never leave home without Rick Steves!,"I've read many of his books cover to cover. Rick makes them fun and easy to read as well as packing in a wealth of information the other guide books just never cover. He tells you what you have to see in the area and then what he would veer off the beaten path for. We've taken his advice over and over again and he never disappoints. He'll take you to those small towns where authentic old Europe still exists and where you can truly relax. I can't recommend his books enough. We've had life altering moments on vacation that would not have occurred if we hadn't taken his advice to stray off the well-beaten tourist path. I highly recommmend the Italy, England and this Germany/Austria book. Reutte, Austria is a slice of heaven - don't tell anyone."
3,Useful but limited and too patronizing,"There is no denying it, this book has lots of useful tips and is easy to use but I did find the tone a bit patronizing at times. I really don't need someone to tell me what to think, even when in a foreign country. I also did not like the ""show this book for x% discount"" offers - I rather pay full price elsewhere and know the place is in the guidebook on its own merits.The book covers only the most popular tourist destinations and is a bit lightweight to my taste on historical details. The author offers sensible advice by saying if you spend $3,000 on a vacation another $25 for additional guidebooks is money well spent.I found the self-guided walking tours despite the not-to-scale maps very useful although I would follow the author's advice and rip the book apart and only carry the vital pages rather than be seen with this book in hand. Of the three guidebooks I used I liked this one the least."
2,Trite and conventional,"Was very disappointed with this book. Not only did it cover only the most touristy places, but it left out many more interesting, not as common, sites. The real tip off is that he lists places that ""guarantee the price listed here if you show them your copy of this book"" or offer a ""10% discount"" with this book. That isn't really objective reporting in my opinion."
3,PERFECT FOR RELIGIOUS PARENTS,"ITS GREAT FOR CHRISTIAN FAMILIES. IT HAS RELIGION INVOLVED IN IT A LOT WHICH I WASNT EXPENCTING, NOT A RELIGIOUS PERSON MYSELF, BUT IT STILL HAS SOME COMMON SENCE ADVICE THAT IT PROBABLY WOULD'NT HAVE COME TO ME WITH OUT READING THIS BOOK. AS AN NONRELIGIOUS PERSON I SAY I LIKED IT 60%."
4,A great book for strenghtening any type of relationship,"This book will give you a better understanding of yourself and others.You will be able to see where they're coming from and thus communicate with them more effectively.From family relationships to friendships,this book will help to strengthen any relationship with someone who is important in your life."
4,personality identification,"The authors were very creative in using these 4 animals to personalize four different personalities that many people fall clearly fall into. This book is a great source for those who desire to improve just about any relationship. I just wish they would improve the examples and the concluding chapter in how to love ""better."""
4,Love these Sandles,"Love these sandles. I tried to buy another pair in a different color, but they were sold out. Great bargin."
2,A Beauty to Behold but a Beast to the Feet,"The shoes are made from very good leather material wich is pretty light in weight considering the style. However, they are not the most comfortable shoes. They pinch the toes and I spent a lot of time with them unbuckled so that I could ease my foot out of them. I wear a nine and these were a nine medium. At one point during the day I wondered if I had on a six and took them off to check. I wondered if I had bought a nine & a half if I would have gotten a better fit. What I found odd is that when I fitted them on their arrival they were fine it is the continuous wearing that revealed the discomfiture."
4,Best ever guide to Database Marketing !,"Hughes is a well-known person in the world of Database Marketing. I have read many books and attended many courses on the subject of this marketing technique, but none of them even comes close to this excellent publication. In an easy-to-read and fascinating writing style Hughes guides the reader along all aspects of DBM; building relationships with your best customers, identifying and converting prospects using DBM for media selections, RFM and Lifetime Value analyses and much more. The book is full of real life examples and hints and tips. Every chapter closes with a summary of the most important learnings. The only part of the book which is slightly out of date is the section about the technology; too much has changed since this last edition of 1995. Also, a closer look at the possibilities the Internet has to offer is missing. Time for an updated version Arthur ?"
3,"Strong tracklist, poor mixing","There are some great dance songs on this cd ('As The Rush Comes', 'Rie Y Lora' probably the most notable), but the mixing really lets this cd down.While the beat is maintained, I wasn't overly happy with the way each song was merged into the next. Certainly not as good as other DJ's have done it.The other point removing a star was a shocking addition of ""Party 93.1"" spoken voiceover throughout the cd, as if this was a radio broadcast itself. I have never seen this done, nor do I want to see it again!So, high energy dance album, good for the gym perhaps, but not as good as other offerings out there. If you can get it cheaply, it may be worth a look."
4,turkey calls,Excellent value. Good sounds and solid storage case. These are an item that need periodic replacement. I will buy again.
4,easy callin,I dont have much experience with mouth calls. Pretty much no experience. I have one other set that I am playing with at the moment. I purchased these because of the reviews. These calls are real easy to use. I like the cut on the corner to let the user know which way the calls are place on the pallet. Within minutes a person will feel like an experienced caller using these calls. Easy use and simple instructions on the back of the package.Great Product.
1,beware -absolutely no edition with subtitles AT ALL-,"there is some type of deception on the dvd urga page amazon provides you with. two items appear on it; while one item states: -russian soundtrack only- , the other one does not. so you are moved to order this other one. BIG ERROR. this other one is with no subtitles either. dont know why they do it. both are the same article!!!check amazon france for the box containing urga (mikhalkov's four films) with french subtitles to be released sometime october novembre 2005!"
2,Slow Paced,"Interesting the first few times, but boring after that. Too slow paced for the average active child. And hard to understand the British accent."
1,High potency = ?,"What does ""high potency"" mean? Other brands tell you exactly what goes into the pill (in terms of mg). This label is ridiculously vague. Why would anyone buy the product?"
2,Not for learning much,"This book is not very good at demonstrating how to do much of anything except how to confuse people. Would be nice to play with for PHD's and the like, but for the rest of us who dont have all day to look at this **** and try to figure it out....its a waist of time. Wish I could recommend a better text however I cant find one yet! Good Luck all!"
5,World's Second Best Blue Cheese,"I bought this and was not at all disappointed. Fresh Home-made taste-Perfect blend of cheese and spices. Worth the price ( cheaper than making it yourself) A very very good substitute for the World's Best "" Bob's Famous Blue Cheese"" availiable only in California."
2,Some information is wrong,"We all know science is a changing subject but some stuff in this book is wrong. Our professor pointed out some things that were wrong, so I hope you're just as smart and can pick them out yourself."
1,Unsatisfactory,They were out of stock of my product and they didn't let me know until 5 days after the order was placed. Very inconvenient and poor communication. Would not recommend.
2,tough subject to make interesting.,Vertebrate Physiology is a dry subject and this book makes it even worse. It was very little help in the class room and the professor very seldom referred to it.
2,Required for my class....,"Oh wow. I was thrilled for this class and I love animals so I was excited to read this book, but it turns out this is the most dull and boring book I have had so far. I have another textbook with some of the same material and it is far easier to read than this book."
5,Do you want to stimulate your kids creativity?,"I wrote my first reviews of K'nex here two years ago. My opinion has only gotten stronger with time.I got my son his first k'nex set 9 years ago. It did more to stimulate his creativity than anything else we've done. It got him interested in learning about geometry, mechanics as he built amusement parks (before K'nex had them as pre-made sets).The best thing about the sets is that the instructions give the kids an idea of what CAN be done. Then after they make something that will wow them (and their friends and their parents) then they can take it apart and make something else. The pieces are totally interchangeable so they are not committed to one particular model.Now my daughter, age 10 is committed to K'nex and I'm thrilled."
4,overall good story,This was a fast paced storyline with good character development. I liked the developing romance between the two male characters. The olny downside for me was that it seemed to target a younger (high school) audience.
4,Entertaining and Interesting,"This book is a great read when you just want to relax and escape. It has interesting characters, a terrific, flawlessly executed setting, humor and romance. I also happen to like the way Huff treats gay/lesbian themes. It's not the focus of the story, but it's there and it's real.There were one or two scenes that I thought were a bit melodramatic, which keep me from giving a full five stars, but this isn't a life changing sort of novel. It's an exceptional action adventure story, nothing more, nothing less. It earned it's place on my list of ""comfort reading"" and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story, and dosen't mind same sex love."
2,"Nice while it lasted, but sprung a leak","Had this very nice-looking (albeit occasionally mistaken for a liquor flask ;-) ) water bottle for a bit over a year. The aluminum gets dented fairly easily, but supposedly the plastic lining inside should maintain a seal. Not for me! One of the dented ""corners"" now leaks. Drip drip drip. I don't know if this is more likely given the oval design--those ""corner"" regions are very dent prone. Also, the colored enamel chips off of the dented regions, which is merely an aesthetic problem, but worth noting in case that matters to you. I'm getting a Klean Kanteen to replace it--my daughter has one, and while it is heavier, the stainless steel doesn't dent (or leak)."
3,A Necessary Evil,"I purchased this because some software simply won't run without one variety of Windows or another, and this one seemed the best fit for the best price. And I cannot really complain about it, because it is exactly what I expected... almost.I am still having trouble with the pop-up that presents itself after each boot-up. It warns me that my system is not safe from viruses, malware, spyware, etc. This is hilarious. I have no sooner purchased the product from Microsoft, installed it, and the product itself is telling me that it is inadequate! Of course, the Security Center helpful directs me to anti-virus software choices, essentially all of which will add to my effective price of purchasing this product. Madness."
3,It's Windows XP SP2 - Any Questions?,"Ok, like the title says; It's Windows XP SP2. So what don't we all know about it by this point in time?Personally I prefer to use my Macs over my PC, but this purchase was for my dad so he could still use Quicken 2008 and Family Tree Maker on his new iMac. Neither of those programs are well represented on the Mac, so Dad prefers to use Parallels running Windows XP to use the versions from his newly retired Windows notebook. It's a workable but clumsy solution until better Mac versions become available.There nothing new to say about Windows XP SP2 that isn't common knowledge now. It is less expensive to use for running VMs like Parallels because of Microsoft's greedy licensing of Vista that requires purchasing Vista Ultimate, the most expensive version of Vista ($219.99), to be permitted run Vista in a VM. I think that is shameless price gouging on Microsoft's part."
5,"Great Product, Right Price",looked for win to intall into imac. Product came on time time and was available for the right price. Thanks for the product it was great!
5,Window XP,I installed this on my Mac book so I could use programs that aren't mac compatible. It works just like it if I had a PC. I'm not very computer savvy but it was easy for me to install and I haven't had any problems.
5,GOOD,"This is a good alternative if you don't need the documentation or support that you get with the normal ($199) version. I bought this and installed it on my macbook pro, works fine, just like any windows operating system...Nothing special."
3,IMac Owners Beware,"I bought this product to run Windows on my IMac after reading reviews from MacBook owners (my video camera didn't have a Mac driver so I had to get Windows to import video). Unfortunately it is an upgrade and is not able to run on new IMacs (with Leopard OS X). The software is supposed to be unreturnable, so it would have been an expensive lesson in trying to save money if the people at the distribution company hadn't been reasonable folks.If you want to run XP on your IMac, you should go ahead and buy the full 32 bit home version with Service Pack 2, twice as expensive, but it's the cheapest version that will actually work with Leopard."
4,It's Windows,"Windows may not be the best OS, but it is the most well known and universally used OS. The install was pretty quick and simple. Mostly the high rating is for the reasonable price I paid for the OS. Other than that it is Windows, so problems will arise unless you are lucky."
4,Window XP for Mac,This software runs better on my MacBook Pro than my Windows XP Professional runs on PC. Great for Mac users that still have a few PC programs that they like.
5,Works perfectly,I purchased this to install on a mac running parallels. Works wonderfully. Flawlessly.
3,Does what it's supposed to do.,"I bought this product to use on a partition on my iMac. I use it to run some software that's not available for Macintosh. So far so good; it runs without any particular problems and the software I use with it seems to run OK too. As are most things from Microsoft it's clunkier to use than the Macintosh side of the hard drive, e.g files are harder to find, but it does the job. If you have to use Windows but don't need a lot of extra functions, this is the cheapest way to do it."
4,Not My Favorite,"I've read a number of Linda Warren's stories, and have enjoyed them all. I feel she is a very, very good writer, and her stories (that I've read) take place in Texas, my lifetime home.This story, while still very good,is not my favorite. Why? Well, while all of her stories have a mixture of family history and strife, and action, this one, for me, leaned a bit too far in the direction of family history and strife, and away from action. And since I'm a fan of action, I missed it in this story.Still a good read by a great writer, though."
5,Love Em!,I love the books! I have been reading every Linda Warren book I can. This is definitely another keeper!
3,"What a hero Tripp Daniels makes! Could have been Zorro, The Lone Ranger, Marshall Dillon all in one.","I had low expectations of this one but am a sucker for a good romance. Add some horses, mesquite, sagebrush and a disadvantaged single Mom to the pot and stir. Not much for literature but entertaining and probably made some money for Ms. Warren too. I hope so."
5,The Best of the Commercially available Christmas recordings.,"Johnny Mathis makes one of his last recordings with the Henry Mancini Orchestra for this gem. The one the radio stations seem to want to play all the time is ""It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas"", but as usual it's not the best song on the album. ""Jingle Bells"" is a creatively-arranged toe-tapper that I enjoy a lot, but for me the best song is one that I actually had to get used to! After listening to a bunch of rousing Christmas tunes, this one, the last song on the LP, slows things way down and brings you back down to earth! Of course, I'm talking about the beautiful ""It's Christmas Time Again"". I bought this when it WAS still available on LP, but it's great on CD, too! It sure beats the heck out of his ""Merry Christmas"" album."
4,The Best of Christmas,"Johnny Mathis presents a relaxing Christmas CD that brings the magic of Christmas warmth to delight the hearts everyone, especially for those who take a moment in the busyness of the season to dwell on the real reason we celebrate the holiday."
3,"Nice looking, lots of features","This light was on the house when I got there but didn't function. I replaced it with the same one because I like the way it looked. I love the dual brightness. At night it will come on at about 50% brightness and then when it senses movement it will go to full brightness, great feature.My only complaint is the adjustability of the sensor. The light is on the side of the building (where my entry is) and since it isn't very wide it doesn't always pick up the person walking by as you are almost below the sensor range. So the sensor does 180 degrees, but the downward arc is not as much as I need, so I have to wave my hand up in the air for it to ""see"" me. If the sensor was better I would rate this a lot higher."
3,Has a nice finished look but one of mine failed and got returned.,"First off I am using a non-dimming CFL (not recommended on the package) and it seems to work fine (I disabled the dualbrite dimming mode). I'm impressed with the number of features and how they look on my house, however...-I ordered two of them and one arrived dead (Amazon refunded my money)-The motion sensitivity adjustment is on the inside, kind of an odd location-When you see it in person the motion detector lens looks very flimsy and glued on cheaply, but motion activiation seems to work fine so far (4 weeks now)"
2,We just went to hook it up,"and it doesn't come with instructions? I don't know if all of them are like that, but there was no manual in the box. We are going to just see if we can figure it out for our selfs."
2,Don't Expect to Ever Get Parts,"That's right. Don't expect to get parts for these as they are only offered by the manufacturer as a complete unit. I just replaced 2 lamps I bought in 2003 because I could not find a control unit to service them and, after further research, have found that the manufacturer will not sell just a lighting control; You have to buy the whole unit. Over time the sensors start to wear out and the function will become erratic. Expect this after about 5 years. When these 2 finally go, I'm going to install 2 ""plain"" lamps and a separate photocell/infrared sensor in a suitable location to control both lights; At least I will be able to replace just that piece."
2,Tons of Errors!,"While this book is written in a very ""user-friendly"" style, the amount of typographical, stylistic, and grammatical errors is incredibly distracting! For a book that's supposed to discuss the precision of research methodology, it certainly has a long way to go in being accurate. It seems that on almost every page there is a typographical or grammatical error, which is completely unacceptable in a professional resource (even if it is targeted towards ""beginners""). There are a couple of chapters in which entire sections seem been left out and others that are very sloppily edited.Surely the author could have forked over a couple hundred bucks to get a professional (or even a half-intelligent grad student!) to proofread it. It is in its seventh edition, after all.If copious amounts of unprofessional errors irritate you in a textbook, avoid this one."
2,I would never recommend unless you are required to get it,"For a book that is supposed to be read as part of a Master's curriculum, this book was lacking.Typographical errors, sloppy layout and not reader friendly. The writer seems to do well because such books are made required reading by other professors.A typical book in 'paper mill' programs that require square filling."
3,everything was great but the shipping was slow...,"The entire transaction was great from buying, price, and promised quality. However, the seller chose 2nd class mail for delivery which was very slow 10+ days to arrive... The book weukd only have cost about $2 to ship even 1st class USPS so the $3.99 shipping is really either a ripoff or you need to add about $2 into the actual price of the purchase when comparing costs with this vendor and others..."
5,Impressive,One can read the pictures of a book to define the logic or knowledge in it. How? Look at the many different views. What scans through ones mind? The past. It did mine. Fifty dollars is just the beginning of an adventures enterance into the unknown. Have a great day! Norma
5,A beautiful and sad true tale,"My daughter and I loved this book, even though the text was challenging for her as a 4-year old. The story of Princess Ka'iulani's childhood, and her bravery, poise, and eloquence in defending Hawaii when the Haoles brought in an army to depose Hawaii's queen, is beautifully told and made a deep impression. Also beautifully illustrated."
4,Unexpected Reading Experience,"I am not sure exactly what I expected from ""Family Silver"", but chuckles and smiles were not on the list. This book engaged me in a way that a good novel does - you want to find out what happens with the folks you meet. The people portrayed are real, feeling individuals with strengths and weaknesses, not cardboard cut-outs. No matter if you have a large extended family, or just a hand full of folks who are close to you, this book will strike a chord. Those people who shaped us as children never truly leave."
3,Not what I expected,"I read this memoir to gain perspective in how a person writes about her own depression and its apparent inheritance from other family members. Unfortunately, O'Brien relates details of her own depression very little, actually making it almost 100 pages into the book before giving any specific information. In addition, while O'Brien described her family members and their dysfunction, she doesn't do much to truly detail how that dysfunction was related to actual mental health issues. Much of what O'Brien describes is typical family interaction or teenage/parent behavior. The book claims to outline the inherited traits of depression passed from her parents/grandparents to her, but in my mind, she fails to do that."
4,Rant?,"The above review (What happened to True Scholarship?) does Tonkovich and her clearly written, well-argued book a real disservice. I am mystified as to how anyone could read a book so moderate in tone as a ""rant."" And, the fact that the above reviewer sees it as a prime example of ""academic speak"" shows that he or she has read very little academic criticism indeed. There are thousands who make much better targets than Tonkovich."
3,Plastic lids didn't fit our dishes,"I just bought this set of CorningWare and to our dissapointment, the plastic covers were too small for both of the dishes. With a lot of effort - we were able to get one of the lids to fit, but there is no hope with the other one. It's unfortunate, because I thought the lids would come in handy for storing leftovers. Aside from the problem with the plastic lids - Corningware has continued to provide good quality dishware."
2,me,Didn't work as expected for my dog. Still seemed to slip on the floor. He is quite old and maybe nothing will help.
4,Chic Chicuelo,"It's exciting to hear a flamenco guitar player with a contemporary sound who is also such a fresh and compelling song writer. The songs are both listenable and tasty dance-alicious particularly the effervescent alegrias Dulce Sal and a driving bulerias, Perigalla. The lovely lullaby, Sheila, is a touching and unforgettable closer on a cd I now play over and over again."
5,They taste great!,"Great buy! I got these for Halloween and I would buy them again. They taste great! I expected a bigger bag, but they are ordered by weight. These were the most affordable and great tasting that I found on line."
4,great walks on amalfi coast,"if you're interested in exploring the hidden nooks and crannies of the amalfi coast this is a great addition to your trip. like having your very own local guide. we hiked the phoenician steps in annacapri, from amalfi to ravello. it guided us up ancient staircases, through hidden alleys and by gorgeous farms. each hike is rated according to difficulty and amazingly rated very accurately. great way to get away from the tourist areas and really get to know this extraordinary place"
4,some instructions should be clearer,"I have generally been very pleased with these guides and have used them for years. However, at times the instructions are impossible to follow. On the recently-added hike up Monte Commune on the Amalfi Coast, we were stymied after reaching the top. Fences and gates (all are now stiles)were mentioned but the book and the ground didn't seem to match. Once we were on the ""stony"" path, we were convinced we had gone wrong and wasted an hour looking for another trail. Nowhere were CAI's posts with arrows mentioned. How were we to know if these posts were for our trail or another one. This is sometimes a problem in Italy as trails are mostly not numbered or named. I wondered if the author had actually walked this trail himself."
1,ugh,"this show is about a skeptical looking eye that floats around and sends these kids messages. It's a little mindless. I loved it when I was like 9 though. but now i think it is very stupid. I mean, who cares if there's a ""ghost"" that writes to some sickly looking kids on a computer in some kind of weird blue mode that's unknown to man? And who cares if he reassembles some letters to make them say ""rally L"" or something? And why can't they tell anyone about ghostwriter? This would have been a good hurdle if they could think of a reason."
3,A comment,"This disc was made famous by its being copied ... and highly praised ...in ""Hattogate"". (Google that or Joyce Hatto)"
3,Good - if you don't own the first Globetrekker Paris,If you own the first Globetrekker about Paris then don't bother buying it - while they go to some different places in Paris and have another tour guide doing it - they mix in clips from the first Globetrekker Paris. If you don't have the first Globetrekker Paris - then buy this one instead - it covers more area and has lots of information.
1,Absolute waste of money.,"Several of my friends (who have been to Paris) have also seen this - it is so poorly produced, it's a complete waste of money. Between it and the sequel, most of the footage is the same. Why waste our time in a cookery class? Guide is uninformative, spends her time arguing with a cab driver and partying with guests and hotel rep rather than showing us, um, er, PARIS. If there was a 0, I would have awarded it."
3,"OK, not great","I watched this DVD after seeing ""Paris City of Lights"" on Amazon Instant Video. This one is much better than that one, but I've since watched some Rick Steves videos which are better still. This one is comparable to a Samantha Brown video, with two attractive female hosts instead of one, and with less of the corny humor.This video uses wide screen format and has much higher quality video than ""Paris City of Lights."" The newest parts were from around 2007, so it's also newer (although other reviewers here suggest that it re-uses some of Justine Shapiro's footage from an earlier production, which I haven't seen). This video spends a little extra time in a few locations: a book shop, a cooking class, Marie Antoinette's cell, etc.If you want lots of information and lots of views of Paris, I'd go with a Rick Steves video. If you enjoy a lighter approach, you might check this one out (but I'd still recommend you check out some others, except don't waste any money on ""Paris City of Lights."")"
4,Learn about the History that lives in your own backyard,"I got interested in the Patapsco River when I went to the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I knew about the general history of the B & O railroad in the Patapsco Valley, but this book opened up an entire new window on the history of the Patapsco Valley. Travers' prose makes the history of the Patapsco Valley easily accessible to everyone and the geographic organization of his book makes it useful as a guidebook too."
1,Beware of the Drivers,"Lexmark has the worst driver support of any printer company I have encountered. Not only are there constant problems, but they have a very annoying 'control program' that pops up every time you print something. Avoid them unless you like headaches."
2,"Nelle's Maps, Central America","We are disappointed in this map. It is in several sections, front and back and not easily ""put together"". It seems to be very detailed and that is good. We also thought for the price of the map we would find a few notes of information about the area of which there is none. Also there is no index of the cities so that we could locate particular places."
5,map of central america,"THIS MAP HAS NAMES OF TOWNS,MOUNTAIN RANGES,PEAKS,TELLS WHAT COUNTRY IS WHICH.THIS IS A EXCELLENT MAP"
2,Knocked out or Loaded?,"Bob must have been knocked out or loaded when making this album...The only song that I bother listening to from this album is ""Brownsville girl""....I am a huge Dylan fan and I respect the other reviewers' praise of this album but I just can't see it...Empire Burlesque blows this away and from my recollection of E.B, it was a commercial success (for Bob anyway)..."
1,THIS ALBUM AIN'T THE MACK!,"THIS AIN'T THE MACK I only listen to rap, one of my homies played this and I have to admit it's some pretty awful sh*t! I mean whoa this sucks! Bob ain't the mack daddy of them all. Ice T. RULES!!!. These lyrics are stupid! THis is some lousy stuff!"
1,Most of the reviews below are by the same person,It is obvious that this album is simply awful and that the same person wrote all of the rave reviews below. Take my word for it. This album stinks. And thats saying a lot because I am a huge Dylan fan. Don't Buy It!!!!
2,You'd have to be Knocked Out Loaded to like this dud!,"With only the slight exception of ""Brownsville Girl"" and ""Maybe Someday"" this album is downright painful to listen to. By far, Dylan's poorest 80's album and one of the weakest of his career. A supreme disappointment."
5,"More ""Burlesque""","A nearly carbon-copy of it's predecessor ""Knocked Out Loaded""turns some of the 80's rock elements of ""Burlesque into a formulaand it sounds successful.But it is in Dylan's gospel tribute tonon-violance in ""They Killed Him"" and his poetic ""BrownsvilleGirl"" that carry this music and make it better for us.Get thisand ""Empire Burlesque"" together-they're pretty much of a piece."
1,Dylan scrapes bottom,"In the mid-80s Bob Dylan, in a creative funk after a series of artistic triumphs ie: ""Infidels"" and ""Empire Burlesque"" released this, one of his poorest albums"
1,A super album!!!. . .Super Terrible!!!!,Bob rules!!!!! Usually. But this album is one of those rare cases where Bob doesn't rule anything. Why Bob? Why? I ask you why?
3,not even close to worst,"this has some good songs- you wanna ramble-maybe someday, brownsville girl one great song- under your spell, and come on dylans made way worse: under the red sky- down in the groove- world gone wrong- good as I been to you if I recal under the red sky might have had one alright song on it besides that all those albums have not 1 halfway decent song. Still I remeber the rolling stone interview during the recording of this and he was really rocking in the studio- but who knows what happened to those tracks??- When they reviewd this album they mentioned that none of the rock they witnessed was on it- but all in all not terrible."
3,"A bad album, One Miracle Song","The album is a complete nothing except for a nice chorus on ""They Killed Him"" and BROWNSVILLE GIRL which somehow comes out as one of the 4 or 5 greatest Dylan songs of all time, and the funniest thing he has written if not ever than at least since ""Clothes Line Saga"". Its a miracle that at the nadir of his creative power Dylan could hook up with a borebag like Sam Shepard and produce such a brilliant song."
3,certainly enjoyable,"After reading reviews that this album and Down In the Groove are Dylan's worst albums, and still determined to collect all his albums, I find that this album is pretty enjoyable and a couple songs are my favorites. In my opinion, Dylan's worst albums are quality-wise at least as good as most other artists' best. There is just something about them. Also, they reflect the time and mood when they were made."
4,Worth it just for the one song,"Every Dylan album seems to have its own flavor. This one has an interesting, kinetic, Southwestern feel. Not so much as, say DESIRE, but this is definately a unique album.What makes this work great, however, is the masterpiece of BROWNSVILLE GIRL. It is probably Dylan's best song about lost love, the bittersweet memories of more innocent times, and the open plains of America. I once met Kris Kristofferson, and even he said that this was a great song. Bob never plays this one in concert, but he should. It's about as magical and heartbreaking as music can ever get."
3,Still pretty good.,"Now, the majority of this album can be hard to handle. I hate to admit it, but it is. Brownsville Girl and Driftin' Too Far From Shore are the only ones that saved it for me. All I can say is that the guy went through a creative slump, he even states in Brownsville Girl, ""If anyone has an original thought out there, I could use it right now."" But what can you expect with the amount of music Dylan had made, some of it had to be not up to par. It is still worth having in your collection, because 3 or 4 of the songs are worth listening to, it's Bob's worst, but still pretty good."
4,Darn good!,"I have a pretty complete Dylan collection, but this is one of those 80's-early 90's releases that I've avoided. Expected the worst, but really enjoy Knocked Out Loaded (except for the embarrassing ""They Killed Him""). Interesting how some cuts foreshadow Bob's roots-based late-90's resurgence. An essential CD for any serious Dylan-ophile. Not as good as ""Infidels"", but definitely superior to Empire Burlesque."
3,its Bob Dylan's garagre album,"Oh sure it isn't ""Infidels"" or ""Empire Burlesque"" but the songs : maybe someday, driftin to far from shore and brownsville girl are must haves.""KOL"" is 80's trash at its best!"
1,Bob doesn't rule on this one!!!!!!,"Neil Young may be the godfather of grunge, but Bob's the godfather of everything else. Marlon Brando couldn't hold his own against Bob and a harmonica. Sonny Corleone would have to sit down with Bob in the room. Even Al Pacino, Scarface himself, would have to admit that Bob is the tops in Miami. But they all run circles around Bob when it comes to this travesty. Don't waste your money folks. It ain't worth it."
1,Bob!?,BOB!? I was watchin Hardcastle and Mcormick and Sonny Crocket was on and the theme song was going through my head and all I could think of was that this was a really cool song. Anything's better than this album!
1,HERE SIND AM BESTEN (A PILE OF DUNG),Immer gibt es ville leute desen liebsliebmusik is es am besten. Aber es gibt nur eine grupe dass am besten Musik mach. Sie sind Bob Dylan. ENGLISH TRANSLATION: A very poor album and not worth the 40 minutes you'll waste listening to it
2,Too '80-ish,"I bought this record becasue I liked one song (Under Your Spell) which I used to listen, in a cassette I recorded, in my collegue years. I still like that song and I wanted to have the whole CD in case I missed something. Well, I didn't. Although the music as composition is OK (never underestimate Dylan's brilliance), the production is horrible. And by production I mean the musical Zeitgesit of the '80s. Let's not forget that the '80s were the decade of the producer, not of the musician. The record is horribly and badly ""overproduced"". Electronic drums, exagerated reverbs, too many arrangements go against the very nature of Dylan's music. Knocked Out Loaded is a testimony of its own time in that sense. If you want a documentfrom the '80, this is it. Just don't expect a good music product."
1,I Got Loaded Then Got Knocked Out!,"It's the only way I could stand to listen to this painful cacaphony. Sorry Bob, that's just the way I feel."
1,A failure from Dylan,"I Got Loaded Then Got Knocked Out! It's the only way I could stand to listen to this painful cacaphony. Sorry Bob, that's just the way I feel."
3,Overlooked Dylan,Look is this Zimmy's best album? Far from it.... But worst? No way. This suffers from some 80's production (not nearly as bad production wise as Empire) Anyways give it a chance again....the songs are decent and in my humble opinion this is much better than down in the groove (which I think might be close to Dylan's worst album).
3,Not a Failure,"Knocked Out Loaded is a good album. What makes it for me is Dylan's sneering attitude and gunslinger singing. The songs are smart, combining old, true rock and roll forms with Dylan's more brainy, surprising lyrics. Maybe as a whole the album doesn't have that aura of poetic illumination of Dylan's masterworks, but there's nothing here that deserves to be belittled or ignored. Dylan seems to be plowing his sources, from gospel to early rock and roll, trying to connect his own songs and performance with the original, founding energy. I think the songs are pretty gallant overall. Brownsville Girl is of course as fine as fine can be. Under Your Spell is charming, with lyrics reminiscent of Time Out of Mind. It's a shame that this album has to be defended, because I think it's really great."
1,Obviously a bad move by Bob,Bob Dylan has done so many great albums in his day but this one is NOT one of them. Take my word for it folks. There are far greater examples of Dylan's talent than this DUD!!!!
1,Do not buy this if you're looking to get into Bob!,"There are so many great Bob albums out there, please don't buy this one if you're looking to get into Bob:Blonde on Blonde, Highway 61 reveisited, Blood on the tracks, freeweelin' Desire and Bringin it all back home should be your first stops."
3,Decent but not great.,"A few songs on ""Dylans Lost"" period album were decent.I liked ""They Killed Him"" the Kris Kristofferson song.That being said, this album is kinda for Dylan completist.It's not the worse but not very memorable- just ""OK""Now if this had ""Band Of The Hand"" I would highly recommend the albumbased solely on that song, probably Dylans best of the 1980's and very hard to find."
4,Very good sample exam,This book is loaded with very relevant exam questions. Most of the topics covered by the test are addressed in this book. The mathematical type problems in this sample exam are very representative of the actual test problems and serve as a good review for general surveying review. The solutions to the problems are straight forward and easy to decipher.I would recommend this book to anyone taking the LSIT or PLS exam. This was my main study tool when I took the surveying exams. It will really help you out!Good luck!
3,Good starting place for LSIT,"While this book will not totally prepare you for the exam, it will give you a basic idea of the format and content. The Land Surveyor Reference Manual is a very good book for in-depth study."
2,Don't overpay for this.,"This sample gives a reasonable overview of the exam's format, but do not make the mistake of thinking that this exam is an accurate representation of the actual Fundamentals of Land Surveying exam. While this may be a helpful aid, be sure to include other materials in your study plan and certainly don't spend hundreds of dollars on this book, only to give yourself a false sense of security."
1,was a poor representation of the real test,I PERSONALY FEAL THAT IT WAS A MISLEADING REPESENTATION OF THE TEST PASSING THIS WITH EASE.THEN HAVING THE FALSE SECUTITY FOR THE REAL THING
1,Not what you think.....,"We purchased a queen sized version of this mattress pad with a gift card. Mattress pad arrived damaged. Worse than the damage is that the mattress pad surrounds the entire mattress - nearly impossible to take on and off. There is no padding, just a fabric covering. Once you take it off to wash, its hard to tell what end is up. I have given up on this and am shopping for another mattress pad."
1,not what they say.,"one star because they are advertised differently than what you get. what i got was a 6 by 8 its 8 5/16 to be exact, not 6 by 9. horrible material, very poor quality. dont waste your money."
4,worked ok not best,nothing spectacular but they worked you can make them work if need be thats about all i can say about them.
1,NON FITMENT,These were ordered for a 2005 Toyota Corolla and with the weather was finally able to install these. These adapters DO NOT FIT as described.Please be aware that these are universal adapters and not specific to 2005-2008 Toyota Corollas. Waste of good money.... Beware...
2,I hope it was just a packaging mistake and will be corrected by the company,"I purchased this product. I was anticipating 6x9 adapter for my 6.25 component system. What I received was a product marked ""82-6901"" subtitled Universal speaker adaptors for mount 5 1/4 or 6 1/2 spkr to 6x8. I called the company to make sure this was for 6x9 they said yes and I should open the product and check the mounting points. I did and just as suspected off an INCH. Horseshoes and hand grenades an inch is okay, not when mounting speakers. So until I hear back from the BlamoShop, LLC and I am treated fairly I will remain disgruntled."
4,Don't Judge a Book by its Cover . . .,". . . Such is true for this CD, which may be the best of Neil's 1980's output, outside of ""The Jazz Singer"". The secret to this album is not what's on it, but who's on it. Stevie Wonder, Burt Bacharach, jazz stellars Nathan East, Bobby Caldwell and Paulhino daCosta, just to name a few. But the real gem here is ""Stand Up For Love"", which features Maurice White of Earth, Wind & Fire on background vocals. And this is the only place you'll find it. In addition, Bryan Adams' pen is responsible for ""It Should Have Been Me"". ""The Story of My Life"" is a powerful ballad, good enough to be included on Neil's ""The Greatest Hits"" (which I don't advise by the way). If you're looking for more great Diamond hits, don't head for the future....head back to his 60's - early 70's work."
4,A slice of techno-pop,"When I first listened to this CD, I was a little surprised Neil Diamond strayed pretty much from his usual ""soft side"" and went for a harder techno-pop sound here. This is not a bad CD to say the least, and many of the heavily synthesized tracks provide a welcomely refreshing change of pace in songs like the title track ""Headed For The Future"", ""Stand Up For Love"", and the Stevie Wonder penned ""Lost In Hollywood"", on which Stevie provides the keyboards. This CD also has its melancholy side with tracks like ""The Man You Need"" and ""It Should Have Been Me"", as well as sentimental tracks (""I'll See You On The Radio) Laura"" and ""Me Beside You"". The techno-pop, synthesized sound is alone worth the price of this CD. Even true Diamond fans will want to add it to their collection. A must buy!"
5,Very Good Neil Diamond CD from the 80's,"I just purchased this 1986 Neil Diamond effort and I found it to be an enjoyable collection of 1980s adult-contemporary pop,with the synth-heavy title song,a pair of EW&F's Maurice White-helmed tracks(""Stand Up For Love"" and ""Angel""),the David Foster-produced power ballads (""The Man You Need"" and ""It Should Have Been Me"",the latter written by Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance) and the lovely ""The Story Of My Life"" being the highlights.It may not to everybody tastes,especially for those who prefer his early work,but most Diamond fans should add this to their collection since its pretty cheap($6.99-7.99)."
3,"Works well, light is too bright","If you are sensitive to light when you sleep, this may be too bright for you. The night light built inside, gives off this green flourescent glow. I tried covering up the light with part of another old Vick's scented pad, but it was still too bright. It does, however, scent up the room nicely with menthol vapors all night long."
1,Worse Than Useless.,"I don't know whose brilliant idea it was to put a blazing bright light in this thing and call it a nightlight, but I don't know how anyone is supposed to sleep with this kleig light illuminating the whole room.Not that it performs its intended function anyway. I was not aware of a single vapor coming out of it all night and I don't feel like it provided any benefit at all. I got far more relief from putting a Sudacare Shower Soothers Tablet in a cup of hot water next to my bed.I had to get rid of this ""vaporizer"" in the middle of the night because the light was giving me a headache.A total waste of money."
1,It is NASTY!,"I bought one of these for my son's room. The first night we had it, he and I stayed with my mom where we share a guest bedroom, so I was in the room too. I woke up around 1:00 am dreaming about rotting soup and quickly realized the rotting soup smell from my dreams was actually the waterless vaporizer. It was the most disgusting smell I have ever smelled. I want to gag just thinking about it now. It is boxed back up and will be returned next time I'm out."
5,Shaggy Latch Hook Kit,"This item is a little different from a regular latch hook rug, the yarn strands are really long and when you try and pull it through in kinda gets stuck and then it frays the yarn. I wouldn't buy another one. If you pull it through really SLOW it works well SOMETIMES.. Stick with a regular latch hook rug, much easier and looks much better.."
2,Some inappropriate text,I gave this text a star because I did learn a few things. Its got some verbiage of abortion thats in inappropriate. The writer is against abortion and it screams it in his text. This book is used in a college course and needs to be bias of all topics. This is a logic class so abortion talk should not be in it. Just another book to make woman feel guilty about free choices that they make.
5,A MUST HAVE NASCAR FACTS BOOK,"HEY NASCAR FANS , IF YOU ARE EITHER IN A FANTASY RACING LEAGUE OR JUST A FAN ,THIS BOOK IS A MUST . TRACK REVIEWS, DRIVER REVIEWS ,OWNER REVIEWS .WITH ALL THE CHANGES FROM LAST YEAR ,THIS IS A GREAT RACE BY RACE REFERENCE ."
3,She's a tough one!,"Fire in the night is a cheap attempt to make an action packed movie, but lacks quality acting. A feeble plot which basically centres around a small town, being terrorised by a martial artist and thug. Until local girl Terry (Graciella Casillas)decides she's had enough and starts to train as a hard street fighter. After putting on a few pounds of muscle she wastes some of the thugs' mates. And like in all the ""good versus evil"" flicks, she flattens him and he skips town.Its a typical Karate Kid style movie, but even though Terry is a woman, her size and strength could probably kill ""The Karate Kid!""An impressive bit in the film is when Terry is in training. She weight lifts with two 28lbs sledgehammers, swinging them and lifting them like there were couple of ice picks!!!"
1,She's a tough one!,"A light hearted attempt at an action packed flick, but lacking decent actors. The cheesy plot centres round a small town which is basically being terrorised by a local hardman and thug. Until Graciella Casillas (Terry) decides she's had enough and trains to become a female street fighter. The inevitable outcome being she wipes the floor with him at the end, and he skips town.Theres quite an impressive part in the film where Graciella whilst training, weight lifts with two 28lbs sledge hammers, swinging them around and lifting them like they were a couple of ice picks."
5,Trash cans,Two stainless steel trash cans for a great price. they even have a bucket that comes out for ease of emptying.
4,FUNKY DISCO POPS,"I've been waiting for this album to appear on disc for quite a while. This pairs the wordsmith/lunatic Dury with the unshakable Riddim Twins. This album wasnt well recieved when it originally was released with the exception of ""Spasticus Autisticus"" featuring Tina Weymouth in a cameo vocal. The vibe is laid back lunacy. The last great Dury album."
3,Old fashioned games. Cardboard presentation ok.,"No surprise , as expected this is a book not an electronic game. In 2011 this may please more to old timers of 50 like me than to younger children of the Harry Potter generation. BUT even so I did not find the item special nor luxurious enough to keep it in my game collection. I gave it for X-mas to my 10 y.o. brilliant nephew and did not hear from him if he liked it or not..."
2,Maybe the 4th edition will correct all the mistakes.,"After spending about 3 weeks going over all parts of this book, I find it lacking in too many areas. There are just too many errors, too much misleading information, poorly worded questions and contradictory information. I reached a point where I feel I cannot trust this book to adequately prepare for any of the tests. One would think that by the third edition the book would have been profread enough the catch all the mistakes."
4,its good but missing stuff,the book is great so far i feel confident in takin the ase in may....except for brakes. i have taken brakes before and nothing that was on the tests were in this book mainly the electronic braking questions that will either pass or fail you. but other than the brake section the book is great!
3,"good , helpfull .","i ordered this guide for ase because i had to renew several tests..i did use it and slowly got comfortable with the study set up . it takes some getting use to. a lot of questions are packaged with a brief explanation of the subject .i never really felt completely satisfied with it.. i felt that the book should have offered more, included more relevant questions to todays automotive system, and offered more in depth explanation for the study questions.but the fact that there are so many questions does help."
3,Not so sure,"I had just taken 5 test past three, I checked with some of the info in this book after the test. I found little that correlated with the questions.I passed the three, because the info did not change in those three areas in along time.The others, material wasn't even close.Am looking for another test booklet"
4,If only I'd read this!,"I just did the tests, 4 per night which wasn't too bright, plus I'm not a mechanic, but we'll see how it goes. I think this book has a lot of good stuff in it, I learned a lot."
1,"Nice to look at, but no good photos","I had a Canon S10 before buying the Sony DSCP9. The Canon S10 took photos without my having to worry about lighting conditions and focus. The Sony, on the other hand, takes really bad photos when the light is not perfect. And it does not have a good autofocus if the light is a little low. It is not able to focus if the subject is nearer than 20 inches, even with the macro turned on.I sold the Sony after only 3 months and bought a Canon S40. Now this is a really good camera!Sony cameras look very, very nice, but the photo quality is really bad for a camera of this price."
2,"Somtimes good, most of the time bad","This is a pretty camera to look at. It is small and compact. The problem that I find with the camera is that it does not like darkness, and the flash most of the time over-powers the subject. I found that you had to really read the book and understand the features of the camera before you could take some what of a nice picture. Only 3 out of 10 pictures that I take would I consider good quality. Other than that, my 1.3 megapixel sony 3.5 floppy camera takes just as good pictures. I don't recommend this camera."
3,Battery Issues,"I had my camera about a year when it stopped charging fully. It is supposed to get 120mins on a full battery and only got 20. After trying two new batteries I called Sony to be advised that they would look at it for a cost of $180!!! It would have cost me around $200 with shipping! The only people allowed to service Sonys are Sony. You can't bring it someplace else. Kind of like a Volvo in that respect. Moral of the story, when buying a camera make sure it is something that your local camera store can fix."
2,"it does not like dark, does not like flashes","i bought this camera a few days ago.my co-worker loved this camera, and told me to buy this one repeatedly, since it's such a good camera. so, i did. and, i was disappointed immediately, when i took first few photos. i took so many pictures indoor, trying to find out what was wrong. it didn't seem to focus right in dark with flash light. pictures come out fuzzy, blurry.... :<so, i returned it after a few days try... got Sony Dsc-S85.DSC-S85 worked much better, taking much better pictures at the same price. if you like to carry a camera in your pocket all day long, DSC-P9 may be way to go, but, if you want better picture, clearer picture... get DSC S85... its twice more functions and it is twice clearer imo... i am very happy with DSC S85 even though it's heavier. DSC P9 didn't cut it for me."
5,This camera is Money,I love this thing. The pictures are so crisp. I had a 2.1 megapixel camera and was worried that there would not be a huge difference but I was wrong. There is no fuzz or anything. The pictures look amazing and the camera has tons of features.
2,S.S. General,"S.S. General--A good story-historicaly inaccurate,to much one sided.Ex:Dec.'42 Paulus had only about 100 thanks left,not 600.Tigers were not yet in operation in the southern front.Theodore Eicke was a good div.comander in the Demiansk pocket.The author doesn't seem to know the difference between concentration camps S.S.Einsatzgruppen and Waffen S.S.Most Waffen S.S.div. had troops of high calibre,motivated,well trained, they organization more democratic than regular army, recived the most decorations also they suffered extremely high losses.I only agree with the author about one thing:war is a terrible waste."
3,"One of his best works, but...","This book is everything BUT historically accurate.I can't believe that, with the Internet available to anyone, you have not yet discovered that Sven Hassel NEVER fought in any battle ofWorld War II, never went to Russia, never fired a gun!He was a Danish Gestapo-informer named Borge Villy Redsted Pedersen. It's all fake, even LEGION OF THE DAMNED is fake.However, the merit in his books are the humor, the anti-belic statements, their anti-heroes."
4,Stay Away From the Provided Crayons,"This is a great coloring book for the hit animated show ""JoJo's Circus."" The cover illustrations are bright and beautiful and the artwork inside is just as nicely done. The book even tells a little story as you flip through the pages. The ""Tear and Share"" pages are a nice bonus that allow finished works to be easily removed and placed on a refigerator or anywhere else one might want to hang them.However, whatever else you or your kids do with this coloring book, stay far far away from the provided crayons. Try using markers, or colored pencils, because the crayons do not color in very well at all. They crumble and leave the area that you were trying to color in patchy and ugly."
4,"Good book, left me wanting a bit more....","This is a good easy to read book that has good information about getting closer to birds. Really good techniques for building a blind and outstanding web site and information in the back of the book. There are some very neat ""tricks"" that he tell about how to get that great shot. However, I was just left going... hmmm I would like a bit more.But for the price, shesh, it is worth it. Used for just over $1, yeah buy the book. Great for a reference book if anything."
5,A GREAT READ,My first one isn't even born yet and my wife and I love this book. It is just an all around great children's book. The characters are marvelous. It has a lot of great twists.
4,Tuff Fluff,"I purchased this book for my 5-year-old niece because she is really enamored with brains. The story is really cute, and she reads it over and over. The pictures are really colorful, and the story is pretty funny.I would recommend this book to any child in the 3-6 year age range."
1,OMG the worst game ever!,"This game sucks so bad it leaves you frustrated. Controls only work half the time and with no instructions, its almost impossible. Workers dont follow commands and gameplay is horrible. I cant believe activision actually put their name on it. BLEH!! If i had four thumbs they'd all be down. What a waste of $20."
5,A great book for learning,This is a great source for learning and should be used in classrooms to teach students of the many important facts of the states in this country.
2,Lays in the closet,"My children and I enjoy looking for out of state tags while on the road. I thought my daughter would enjoy this, but it's the search that's fun."
3,Mexico connected.,"I've now completed Pindell's North American train trilogy, and have found him to be the perfect traveling companion. If this book is slightly less successful than the earlier ones, it is only because the central metaphor -- trains as history -- sits less comfortably on Mexico than it does on the US and Canada. For those who love trains, geography, or cultural history, this book provides some clean connections."
1,Author has nothing original to say about Mexico OR trains,"You might find it hard to believe that someone who can't speak Spanish would undertake a travel book about Mexico. However, this turns out not to be an authentic travel book, but simply a re-hashing of Mexican history obviously taken second-hand from other American & English writers, & arbitrarily attached to a map of various train rides (which are perfunctorily described but not effectively connected in any way with Mexico)"
2,There are better Mexico books out there.,"This book makes an attempt to be a travel memoir, history book and a political statement all in one. It does not cover any one area very well. Your time would be better spent on concentrating on books that cover these areas in proper detail. The author gets too far off on politics in the second half and it was a struggle to not just put the book away and forget it. There are a few good tales of travel on the Mexican trains, but you have to put up with the rest in between. Not worth the time."
5,Spiritual Warfare; Richard Ing,"I enjoyed reading the book, it was written different from any book I have read on spiritual warfare. He ensured that the reader was aware of all the techniques and strategies to come against the forces of darkness - strongholds. One cannot but appreciate the exposure of Jezebl and Ahab spirits in the Body of Christ; controlling women and passive men. For certain, I will encourage others to read and I will read more of his books."
2,Turtle Sundae coffee review,"I generally like flavored coffee, so I was surprised that I found the Coffee Masters Turtle Sundae flavor to be too sweet to the point of near unpalatability."
2,Lack of comfort kills this product,"I tried this product but quickly returned it.Unfortunately I agree with the previous reviewer. When sliding the shaver across my face it almost feels like its scratching rather than gliding. It was especially painful when doing the neck and jawline. I blaming the sharp edges on the heads for this lack of comfort. The Norelco Quadra is much more comfortable to use with smooth , well rounded edges on the heads. I feel that it doesn't shave as close as the Norelco but perhaps this is because I didn't give myself time to adjust to it.In all fairness it is solidly built and has a feels plenty powerful. Trimmer is much more effective than the Norelco Quadra. It also can be washed.Pass on this one. Go for the Norelco Quadra."
1,It makes my skin bleed.,"First I thought that the name ""TCT"" (Total Closeness Technology) would made this a good shaver, becuase I have been looking for a shaver that can give me a nice, clean shave. This shaver gives a pretty nice shave except for one thing. The edges of these three round cutters are pretty sharp. Every time I shave, my face gets red and extremely irritated. Sometimes I bleed. It feels like I am scratching my face with a sharp scissors. This is my second Remington products and both of them are terrible. I would go for Braun, since it has a good worldwide reputation on making good shavers."
3,Dispelling cookie myths,"While the beginning of the book does a decent job of dispelling some cookie myths, it is, understandably, a little out of date already.I did have a couple of objections to the book. It should have had a companion CD with the codes or a web site to go to.Also, the proliferation of typographical errors (half a dozen or so in just the first 60 pages) is unacceptable for any book let alone something of this nature (McGraw-Hill...are you listening???). That's another reason why a companion CD is necessary. I would not spend time on code I don't trust. I'd never know if it was my typing ability....or the code that was wrong."
2,Just read the spec,The cookie spec is only a few pages long...for a reason.Cookies just aren't that complicated. You simply don't need a book ofthis length to figure out how to use them. A short web-based tutorial is more than enough.
5,Love Tony,"Absolutely love this book. It is so enteresting and open. This is a Must if you are a Tony fan, or just want to read about a loving and down-to-earth entertainer."
5,Classic Arabic music,"I must admit I was very pleasantly surprised when I purchased this CD, at first I was a little hesitant, but now I am very glad I did. Aicha has a very powerful and beautiful voice, she sings in a variety of styles, ranging from her native Morocco and Anadalusian style, to Egyptian, even to Levantine. I personally loved it and almost immediately went out and searched to see if she has any other works. I was not disappointed, she has one other CD which is also very good, but this is my personal favorite. Even if you are not a connossieur of Arabic music, and I have played it to a number of my friends who are not, you will love this CD, in fact many have thanked me afterwards for introducing them to her. It is certainly not pop music so if that is what you are looking for, this is not the CD for you, this is real musicianship and excellent singing. Aicha and al-Adwar attempt to recreate the classical Arabic genre and they do a pretty good job."
4,"Comfy and classy, but the front top covers too much and sole is wider than necessary.","THey were great when I first got them. In fact they felt snug and tight in the front. Howevere after two good long days of breaking them in, they got really wide and loose. Now I have to wear them with insoles or with a heel pad on the back of the shoes to keep them from slipping off. Strange, lifestride WIDE usually works for me. Must be the leather....its stretches a lot. It's shiny shiny and the top part where your toes are....they cover too much. In fact it covers so high that sometimes when i bend my feet, it hurts at the top and rubs against the top of my foot, cause it covers wayy to high up."
1,Can you judge an audiobook by the cover?,"I haven't listened to this yet, but isn't the cover of this guide to Rome adorned by a photo of the Acropolis in Athens?"
4,Idioms Sidekick,"The task of learning idioms is daunting for ESL students. Approaching this matter lightly often leads to frustration. Berman and Kirstein have managed to avoid the traditional dictionary approach and made Practical Idioms an invaluable tool for the mastery of such phrases. I would shrink the over-1,000-idiom list and increase the number of exercises available. This might further help students in their struggle to harness idiom power for more authentic, near-native communication. Great buy!"
3,"Good for the price, but a bit text book.","This book was nice to read, but a little boring. If you listened in biology class then this book is not for you. Just your basic stuff really. If you want a good informative read with really helpful information (especially for 1st timers) then Conception, Pregnancy and Birth (Dr. Miriam Stoppard) is a wonderful book, with helpful information on excersise, newborn care and wonderful pictures!!"
3,"Planning for Pregnancy, Birth, and Beyond","I was a little disappointed with this book. I was looking for user-friendly, in depth information, and it didn't quite make it. Although it is more recent than John Sussman's books, it is certainly not easier to read."
3,Covers the basics,This book is pretty simple and basic. It covers all areas of pregnancy but not too much in depth. Its a good book if you want a basic book to refere to for things. Or you are pregnant for the first time and need to learn all the basics. I purchased other books along with this one for more in depth info on matters that were important to me. Overall this book is easy to read and I enjoyed reading it to review the basic stuff I need to know about pregnancy.
3,Overall Good Double Stroller,"Overall the Snap-n-Go is a good double stroller as it allows you to not wake your sleeping twins and transfer them from the car to the stroller with ease. Also the stroller folds up very well and is extremely lightweight. The weight of the stroller was very important to me, especially after a C-section, but also I have a SUV and was worried about being able to lift a heavy stroller in and out of the trunk area. With this stroller there is no problem.The only problems that I have with this stroller are:1. After about 9 months of constant usage the basket underneath started to rip at the seam and is now a huge tear. Although the basket snaps on the company does not sell replacement baskets (they should).2. The stroller is the limo's of strollers and after about 6 months of constant usage it became very difficult to stear. I'm about to try WD-40!Overall this is a good stroller and I'm very happy with it. If I had another set of twins, I would use this stroller again."
5,"Love, love, love this stroller","My twins were preemies and their tiny heads just bobbed around in the first double stroller we bought. Then I heard about the Double Snap-N-Go and thought ""what a great idea!"" I don't have to disturb them taking them from the house to the car or the car to the store, etc. I got a Snuzzler for their car seats so they wouldn't bobble around.. and now I just pop the car seats onto the Snap-N-Go and we're mobile! The stroller adapts to fit several different car seats and is easy to configure/put together. I was particularly impressed with how sturdy the stroller is, yet it is still surprisingly easy to fold up and put into the back of the car. The large storage basket underneath is also a big plus. If you have twins you absolutely MUST have this stroller."
5,Great customer service from Baby Trend,"I ordered this stroller from Travelling Tikes b/c it was cheaper than Babies R Us. I had the single one with my singleton and knew I couldn't live without this one for my twins! I got black, since it matched my carseats better than the navy blue and I just love the way it looks! The best part though was the customer service. When I put it together, for some reason the safety strap wouldn't reach across my carseat. I tried all of their recommendations but it just wasn't reaching. So after a quick and painless call to Baby Trend, they sent me a strap extension that does the trick! Thanks, Baby Trend!"
4,great but hard to handle,"when i first had my twins i didn't see the double snap'n'go at any stores only the single one's so for the first 6 months i used a single snap'n'go for the twins. to move around in the stores was great, but i needed another person to push the other stroller. so one day I saw the double snap'n'go. i had to have it so i bought it. everthing was great until I took it to the mall. To move around was horrible i had to fight with it to move right or left. it works better outside where there is more friction. but other then that it's so much better than having to separate stollers."
4,twins,I would recommend this product highly the only thing about this item is its need a little more storage space.
5,Great for infants,"This is the best stroller for two little-ones. My problem with the others that I tried was that they are so bulky and wouldn't fit well in my trunk. I like how this one is so scaled down - you just pop the carseats in and go (I use BabyTrend carseats). It is easy to set up and easy to break down. I am changing the a side by side once the twins can sit up because I prefer having both babies in arms' reach. But, in the meantime, I wouldn't have any other stroller."
1,This product was very disappointing,"I purchased this product as I have had twin girls.They were preemies and only weighed 4 lbs.At first it seemed great, quick and easy but after only 5 months (3months birthweight for preemies) the handle bars started to bend from the weight of my small babies. It became so bad that the metal started to snap. I called and complained to the company and they refunded my money and told me I needed to lift the end up any slight kerb(don't know how they think you can do that when you're by yourself). I have seen other peoples whose are doing the exact same thing. They have a great idea for us twin moms but they need to reinforce the metal.....if you didn't realize the metal was bending it could be quite dangerous if it snapped."
3,How do you get the Graco seats in?,"Great idea but I can't get the Graco snug-ride seats to snap in. I called customer service and their response was that the Gracos ""don't really fit."" But she did helpfully point out that they hadn't had any reports of fatalities. Her advice was to cinch down the retaining strap.Anybody out there who can share how they got this thing to work with the snug-rides?Thanks a bunch."
2,Need Help Securing SnugRide Car Seats!,"I recently bought the double snap n go, intending to use Graco Snugride Car Seats wtih it. I haven't bought the car seats yet, but I brought the Snap N Go to Babies R Us to try them out. The front seat ""locked in"" fairly securely, but the rear one would not lock in. I called Baby Trend customer service, and the response was that only the Baby Trend car seats are designed to lock in. That makes no sense to me - why would they say that Graco car seats fit in if they don't??I've read many reviews from people, and some people talked about the same problem, some people say they fixed the problem, and some people say their Gracos fit great! Please respond if you can shed any light onto this matter."
5,Easy to get in and out of car,"I've been using this for 3 months now with my twins. I really like it because it is easy to get it in and out of the car and get it folded and unfolded quickly. It's been a hard winter here in Boston, and I don't have to spend a lot of time messing around trying to get the stroller set up.At first we were a little unsure of how safe it was because there's just a hook and a strap to hold the baby seats in, but we've had absolutely no problems with that. The carseats go in easily and stay in.We took this for a walk on the beach over New Years, and while it wasn't easy, both my husband and I pulled on it, when we stayed on the packed sand, it was doable. We've also been able to plow it through slushy snow. Considering that this stroller was not made to do either of those, it's pretty impressive. Our friend showed us how to lock the front wheels in place, and that made the ""off roading"" much easier."
3,Great features but hard to push indoors,"I purchased this stroller to transport my twins. I had planned to use this until my babies were old enough to ride in my Peg Perego Aria Twin (not a fully reclining stroller, so not recommended for newborns). I love the convenience of having a travel system without the added weight of the regular travel system stollers. The Double Snap-n-Go also has a huge basket and great parent's tray. Unfortunately, the stoller is very difficult to push on smooth surfaces like you would find inside stores. The front wheels tend to over-rotate making it really difficult to manuever. I really feel like I'm fighting the stroller whenever I take it to the mall. It performs better outside on concrete or asphalt where there's more traction. Its too bad the stroller is so difficult to handle because I really like everything else about it."
1,Clumsy Contraption,"I had the single Snap N' Go for my singleton and found it very useful. When I found out I was having twins, I was happy to find there was a double version available. However, it has not worked out as well as I expected. One of the seats pitches forward (I use it with Graco Snug fit car seats), so one of the girls is always uncomfortable. It is so long that it is difficult to steer, and barely fits in the back of my minivan ('04 Nissan Quest). I have yet to get it to close completely. It is also very heavy. I spend too much time wrestling with this thing. Regret the purchase, wish I would have gone with a travel system."
1,not worth it,I was disappointed with this book since it is not as good as the ab book in this series. It mostly features exercies to do in a gym.

1,What happened?,"Seriously, what was Margaret Wise Brown smoking in 1949? In contrast to her well-loved ""Goodnight Moon"" and ""Runaway Bunny"", this book is a complete disaster. That said, it happens to be our 2 year old's favorite (for now, of course) - but it's random, poorly written, and just downright weird in places. We do some pretty heavy abridging when forced to read it."
4,Adjustable Overbed Table,Table is a little less steady at full extended height but it is more than fit for purpose. Easy to assemble. Easy to adjust. Supplier must have shipped minutes after receiving my order. Item arrived several days before promised delivery date.
3,Good rolling bed table,"This table does it's job. Nothing exceptional or impressive, it does it's job and should last a good while. It was slow to adjust but needed a little lubrication and it works fine. Just a good buy."
5,"Great apron for washing dishes, too!","I imagine this was made for washing dogs, but I use it for cleaning the kitchen every day, so my clothes don't get wet or messy. I love it! And kids love the dogs on the apron as much as I do. I just wipe it with hot water and soap to clean, very easy! I did put it through the washer once and hung it to dry, and it is fine."
1,I do not recommend purchasing this scanner,"I have been helping a friend of mine with this ""thing"" for months!! Typically it lasts for a few scans and then the gears go out. He has replaced it three times at WalMart and is suspicious that they keep putting the same scanner back on the shelf. HP's customer support leaves a lot to be desired and wants a credit card number up front for anything. I do not recommned purchasing this scanner. For basic document scanning I have had no problems with a Scanjet 2300C. For more advanced scanning I use a higher-end Microtek 9600XL. For slides/film/negatives go Nikon. You get what you pay for."
4,Excellent so far!,An awesome scanner for the money. Paid $39 at Circuit City (Sorry Amazon). Works like a dream. Of course you could get a higher end scanner but it would be a higher end price to boot. Does everything that the model replacing it does for about $50 less.
2,Think twice before buying this scanner!,"Before you buy this item, you should know that HP does not sell replacement parts. And if you scanner goes out of warrantee, it's unfixable.I am an engineer and have discovered a flaw in the design of this scanner. If you should get mixed up with the power supply, and connect the wrong one, not only will it blow the fuse, but it will damage the most critical part in the device... The CCD pick-up. This happened to me. A 16.5-volt power supply was hooked up instead of the supplied 12 volt one. It didn't blow the fuse but it did blow the CCD pick-up.HP does not sell this part, so it cannot be fixed. It becomes Landfill instead. A ten-cent diode could have prevented this but HP had to cut corners. So it is we the consumers that have to pay, and help to destroy the environment as well. Think twice! Don't buy it!Don't buy any other HP scanners it all the same story."
4,A good bet,"I purchased this after returning the Microtek 4850 (which I kept for only one day). The Microtek had a better price, better warranty and better reviews. Unfortunately, although I am an experienced computer user, I found their program confusing and very difficult to navigate. Having no desire or time to devote to attempting to learn to use the 4850 I exchanged it for the HP3570c. HUGE improvement!!! I was up and running in moments. The program is intuitive and straight forward and the results speak for themselves. I deducted one star for the poor warranty. Come on HP - stand behind your products better!"
2,Clumsy Interface,"I recently bought the hp scanjet 3570c to work with my OS X Mac only because my old scanner was no longer combatable with the new operating system. I have been less than pleased with the performance of my scanner. The interface is clumsy, and I feel that I have much less control over scanning preferences (i.e., descreening options) than I use to with my last scanner. The one button scanning never seems to work right. Spend a little more and get something that is going to work well."
2,Not for Windows,"This was my first scanner.... it's going back a day after buying it. Easy to set up on Win XP, but the interface is horrendous... doesn't begin to look like any Windows app I've ever used. Looks more like their HP-UX (ie Unix) legacy GUIfied. About as easy as Unix scripting (ugggh), too."
2,"Taking it back to the store, software is a joke","I've had this product for a days and it scans ok but it is unacceptable in other ways.- Most importantly, when I press scan the software chugs away for 30 seconds before a dialog comes up. On further investigation, the software supplied is an amazing piece of bloatware.- The installation software sits there and chugs looking for DLLs for 15 minutes.- The installed software takes up an unbelievable 4Gb- It looks quite good but the button have little pictures but no text. How is a computer novice supposed to know what each button does?- The quality of the scanned image wasn't very good. I invetigated further and tried using the standard microsoft scanning software. For some reason the scanned pictures came out much better. Confirmed my suspicions about the software."
5,HP scanjet 3570 C Scanner,"This is one of the better scanners I have ever used. In all normalcy I would have rated it at four stars, but with the support I have experienced from HP support, Its worth another star in the rating. Most of my peripherals are HP, and that is because of fine support they give, and the short period of time it takes to get it. My last scanner was mfg. by Plustek, and I would not recommend it to anyone. If you need support on Plustek, you may as well forget it, unless you want to spend all your time on the phone calling Japan, China or Europe.Thank you. John Clausen"
2,Be careful and keep your receipts,"This scanner crapped out after about 2 weeks of scanning. It starting scanning everything as solid yellow or red. HP support confirmed the scanner died. I got the scanner as a gift so I didn't have a receipt and even though HP new it was under warranty based on the serial number, they still required a receipt. Luckily, it was bought on Amazon and the person giving it to me printed off the order confirmation. Customer service with HP is still a hassle so I would avoid HP products if at all possible."
1,HP isn't what it used to be,"I have had nothing but trouble with this scanner from the beginning. In fact, I had to return it twice before I got one that worked at all. HP Tech support is not all that good. I wanted to find the newest driver, and there is one, but they charge $...for it, unlike all other companies where you can just download driver updates. Every call is long distance, they have no 800 number for tech support. Everything has an extra charge. HP has gotten to be one of the worst in quality and support. I will never buy another HP product."
3,Disappointed,After reading Golden Splendor was such a disappointing book. The characters were just so shallow and predictable. I can't believe it was written by the same author'
5,Wonderful Story,"This story was so well written I read it twice in one sitting. The characters are so full of life you feel that you are there with them. I highly recommend it to those who like a fast paced story filled with love, romance and adventure! Great work!"
1,"Huge unremovable ""Free Gift with Purchase"" Label","I just bought this with some knives to give as a present. I was quite upset to see a huge ""Free Gift with Purchase"" label plastered all over the front of it. There is no way to remove the label. And there was no mention of this promotion in the item description. I have contacted Amazon customer service and haven't received any response. Just be aware if you're buying this as a gift."
1,JAHenckels 10 slot Hardwood Knife Storage Black,"If you have a knife longer than 5 inches it will not fit into the holes. Because of that I can store only my shorter knifes i.e. pairing, sandwich etc. I would not have bought this had I known that!!"
2,Block Easily Falls Forward - Knives Empty Out Toward You,"I had no problem loading my Henckels Twin Cuisine knives in the block - however - this block has a very high center of gravity. The handles on the Twin Cuisine knives are heavy and this block was constantly falling forward. Ever have a block of sharp German knives emptying out towards you? When I found I needed to warn every house guest I decided it was time to pitch this block for one that has more support in the front. If you have small knives this block probably works ok, but I would not recommend it."
2,Good for narrow knifes,"First of all, Amazon claimed the list price is $40 which is not true. I found it at Bed Bath and Beyond and it's regular price is $19.99.It's hard to tell if your knifes will go in all the slots because several slots are pretty narrow. I couldn't fit all my knifes in because of the narrow slots. If you are not sure if it would work for you, then you should not buy it online and waste the shipping costs both ways.I am disappointed at Amazon's false price claim."
5,Nice wood :-),"I bought this to go along with a knife set of another brand. This was the right size with the right number of slots for my needs. The only thing I'd improve or look for is one that fits a butcher's knife. Other than that, the different sizes are terrific."
4,Good Buy,"Replacing 35 year old block. While would have preferred upright vs. angled block, this is a solid, well designed knife block. The slots are just right for our knife collection. Quite pleased."
4,Knife Block,I like the knife block. It holds up to 10 pieces. I ony use about 6 of the slots so it is a little oversized for my needs but the quality is excellent.
5,Great little block,"Nice little block, no complaints. Sturdy construction, my Henckels knives fit perfectly, as well as my miscellaneous knives I have laying around my kitchen. My kitchen shears also fit perfectly, they are not Henckels shears."
4,"good product, bad shipper!","The holder is adequate and appears well made. However, it arrived four days late and was left out in the middle of the front yard. No door bell ring or knock. Fortunately I happened to see it before it was stolen. The shipping point is only four hours away. The holder sat in the receiving point three days."
3,Too short,"This is a good looking knife block ,until you put long bread or carving knives into it, which will scratch your counter top. Thankfully I have a handyman that added a spacer to the bottom with open space under it (approximately 1 1/2"")."
2,Decent block with a warning to gift givers,"I bought this block as a gift for a picky chef to use at home for his growing collection of knives. Much to my dismay and total embarrassment, the block was shipped with a HUGE sticker on the outside blaring that it was a ""special gift with purchase"" and no packing slip included. I definitely paid for this gift and feel completely ripped off. It's a decent knife block, but should not be sold on Amazon with a $20.00 price tag or more if it is a blatent free gift with purchase.Just a word to the wise for those who may be thinking of sending this as a gift."
1,Sappy Songs From Mr Pack,"This CD is a big disappointment! I love David's work with Ambrosia, but the songs on this CD are very poor and the recordingis not very good. At this import price it is really NOT WORTH IT!Let's have some PROG ROCK SONGS! and NOT this SAPPY STUFF."
4,Great Songs ! Great Songwriter !,The exleader of Ambrosia still writing great songs after all these years! This cd is a kalidescope of diffrent songs touching on different themes and emotions. Natalies song is a beutiful tribute/love song to the actress.Other songs have the ambrosia feel.Overall this CD is a must have for Ambrosia and David Packfans!
2,Too much talking and not enough music!,"First, let me say that when Little Richard is playing, the music is exceptional even though he does erroneously call himself ""I Am"" which is a Biblical term for God. Little Richard is great but not that great. As I said, the music is great.The biggest and most annoying problem with this CD is the excessive talking between songs. While this is a normal thing to expect in any live concert, the producers of this CD should have curbed most of the talk and let the music play. However, since the CD is only about 30 minutes long, the deletion of the talking would have made this a 15 minute long CD. Not worth the purchase.Unless you are a die-hard Little Richard fan (like me I guess), purchase any of his other CDs. They are longer in length and have more of his music. I wish that more of his live performances would be available except with more music and less talking."
3,OO my SOUL!,"As the title would suggest this is Little Richard singing some of his big hits in concert. The quality is good and of course Little Richard is WAY TO ENERGETIC to be human. It's a good cd and fun to listen to. I especialy like the bits where he talks to the audience. I have the vinly of this so they may have ""cliped"" that part out but if they did demand your money back because he's hilarious to listen to!"
3,Know what you want first.,I thought these were the way to go but ended up using optical/coaxial/HDMI.
4,Brand New,Quick shipping and new book. . . unfortunately could have gotten it cheaper somewhere else.
3,"to ""big"" not enough features!!","hi, i bought this camera. about 6months ago..liked the rugged durable style,but is kinda big and bulky.plus doesn""t have that many fatures.. so i took it backand bought kodak advantix c-800 zoom..at last. a small light weight aps camera with every feature u can think possiblesorry..accura view"
3,"to heavy didn""t like not enough features,, advantix c800","i bought this camera about a month ago.. and i liked the style..but you cant go by that.. it jamed a couple of times..didnt take all that great of pictures..and didnt have all the features my new camer has.like infinityfocus mode,spot focus,portrait,nightview,continus,and three picture sizes.."
2,"Worked OK, but hard to clean","Ours worked for about 3 years before it gave up. It leaked some, but not as much as some others experienced. Our biggest problem was cleaning. We tried additives, but nothing helped against mineral buildup. Eventually I think this what destroyed the heating element. It took a little while at first to figure out how to get to the element to clean it. Not a bad little humidifier, but there are much better on the market now."
1,Odd that this has been so well reviewed...,"But I used this Vicks Humidifier model only once and returned it. First, there something rattling around in the base that clearly should not have been there. More importantly, after only one night, there was crusty brown gunk on the inner unit (even if my water is chock full of minerals, should this happen after only one use?), and aside from the water tank, it was not easy to clean. Some humidifer companies suggest cleaning weekly, but this one would require cleaning after each use.I continue to search for a good, table top humidifier."
3,Works Well ... But noise,"We bought this humidifier about a year ago as a second option for when we had more than one child needing a humidifier. Our primary model was a Sunbeam 1126 (which is no longer avaliable) which worked very well and even though produced noise was more of a white noise that one could sleep to. The Vicks model even though the tank lasts all night and on a low setting is more than adequote for our childrens room of about 180 square feet it is noisey. It uses a boiler plate type system and the heating of the water produces enough noise that I can not use this humidifier in my room as it keeps me awake. I would buy again as a secondary humidifier but no way can this unit be used daily. Also, mineral deposits build up quickly on this model so I recommend using distilled water."
3,I Want the Vicks smell!!!,"Recently my 2 mo old was sick with a cold and was really congested, I was looking for something to scent the air with vicks so I didn't have to smear it on her chest continually through the night. Well as a humidifier this product maybe okay but as far as releasing that soothing vicks smell that I was hoping for it totally failed; I was extremly dissapointed and could not believe how little aroma this device puts out. I wasn't really interested in the humidifier, but this is all they had so in reality I can't rate this as a humidifier, but I am so upset I just want to create some healing air!!"
4,Heaven sent,"I received an Evenflow vaporizer during my shower and thought it would help once baby & I got sick. Way to small for my room. I looked at many vaporizers and warm mist humidifiers that would actually work in our room. This one was perfect. I doesn't run out in the middle of the night, and helps keep the room warm when the heat goes down to low at night [apartment headaches]. The amount of night time coughing has lowered and asthma triggered dryness and dry sinis at night have ended. Perfect buy without the high cost."
4,Well Thought,"I first think that these additional volumes of monsters are really a great help. Often times in the old compendium I find myself not being able to find a ""new"" encounter for the players to deal with. Witht the annual compendiums I find more and more encounters that can add great fun. For example I find that the new types of dragons, golems, and lycanthropes add surprise to the game. My players often know how to deal with anything I throw at them so the new monsters in this book challenge them more and create more fun."
2,I've seen better/,"Okay even this had been the worst of the lot I still would've bought it but thats because im obssesed with collecting every singel compendium. For those of you who arent this book is not neccessairly a must have. Id say the two good parts which stick out are the Wereshark and the Brine dragon. The art <stinks> compared to annual 1 and some of the monsters are pretty stupid too, two words: Centaur Kin. Basically they stuck demihumans on horse bodies, any DM who knows the first thing about monster creation could've done that, if you need a compendium buy annual 1 or 3 which are infinetly better."
5,Excellent resource for teachers!,"Baby Blue is a very realistic and emotional story with a strong message. It lets all the ""Blues"" of the world realize that they are not alone, and it may give them the strength to look for a solution to their situation. Michelle Kwasney writes in a manner that allows the reader to feel the emotions experienced by Blue and her sister Star. As a teacher, it has helped me to better understand the plight of children living in an abusive setting. This book is an excellent resouce for teachers!"
2,Pump not sealed properly,"A couple things worth noting about this:1. It is huge. MUCH larger than your typical soap dispenser. That may be a plus or a minus, depending on what you're looking for.2. The pump mechanism just slides over a tube of sorts (it is not actually attached to the screw-on top). This can lead to poor suction when pumping since air seems to leak in if the angle you're pushing isn't perfect. I get bubbles and sputtering from it as often as I get soap.3. The base at the bottom, screw-on top and pusher-thing are all made out of that grippy, porous kind of rubber that absorbs dirt and grime. Not too bright for something that is going to be used by folks with dirty hands.I bought it mainly because I've been happy in the past with KitchenAid products, but they really dropped the ball on this one. It is not up to their usual standards in either design or build quality. I would not recommend this product."
3,Danv,"I like the size, it works pretty well. The only problem is it seems to leak somehow. I havn't been able to figure out. It collects soap along the edge of the top. The bottom seems to have soap around the bottom too. Like some kind of slow leak around the bottom where it connects with the ceramic middle. I will keep using it for now."
1,Way overpriced! Not what it used to be for the same thing,Two different people had this that we saw and really liked it so I ordered it. This years set does not have the music nor as much items with it and the plastic seems more hard and probably easier to break I will be looking into returning this item. Not pleased at all! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000067R86/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
3,Joseph or a shepherd?,"I have a two year old daughter who loves this toy, but we were disappointed to have a sheep and then either a shepherd or was it Joseph? It would have been nice to have a distinct Joseph!"
3,Cute but a little disappointed,"I think it will be cute for my 2 1/2 year old and my 13 month old, however I was not aware that there were 2 different sets. I was really looking forward to the music and the lighted star. I guess that is why it was less expensive than the set from Fisher Price."
3,Little People Christmas,"I was very disappointed -- I expected the musical nativity, not knowing there were more than one little people nativity. When I called fisher price the representive also didn't know it and couldn't find the nonmusical one. It is costly to return."
5,Little People Nativity,"The little people in the nativity set are durable and realistic to their identity. My grandchildren will enjoy it for years to come, while they are being taught about Christmas."
4,Mary the Single Parent?,"This set does not light up as the other reviewers have said, that was not an issue for my family, the simpler the better and the little people are so durable we love them! However as we unpacked this set we thought at first that the little man doll was a shepherd to go with the sheep, not true, he is Joseph. Fisher Price broke up the nativity scene into several 'sets', this is the basic one, don't expect to tell the ENTIRE nativity story with it, but for our 2 yr old it does the trick. I agree that it is overpriced here, go elsewhere to find a much better deal. (we did)"
1,Overpriced for sure,"I wanted to get this for our son and did a search...on ebay it's going for around $45 new in box...Amazon for nearly the same...PLUS shipping (because it's sold through vendors, not Amazon.Then I went to the Fisher Price store on line (after reading a review here :-) Thank you! I got the Deluxe Nativity for $30, plus $7.99 shipping. I'd rather spend my money with someone who is reasonably priced and not gouging on S"
4,"No more ""Don't Touch""","I remember my grandmother and several aunts had nativity sets that I was always told ""Don't Touch"" whenever I went to look at them. Ever since I got married (14 years ago) I have been on the lookout for a set that was both ""child-friendly"" and cute. This set will fit the bill!I have seen many sets that had the child-like look I wanted but they were always made of china or glass. I didn't want to have to worry about the children ""looking at it"" or the cat knocking it over!I found this by accident while searching for other Little People toys and ordered one. I won't get it in time for Christmas, but that's o.k. It's my gift to myself. Best of all the set can be handled, packed and unpacked and used for many many years without fear of breaking.The trick will be to keep my 3yr old from putting Joseph and Mary in the helicopter that comes with the Little People Airport we ordered!!"
5,Fisher Price Nativity,"It was a disappointment to find this item out of stock in the month of November with Christmas more than a month away. Everyone I showed this to wants one and keeps asking that I find it somewhere, but it is not in your stores. This is a great toddler tool. A nativity that they can pick up and look at and you can talk to them about--that a little one is not forbidden to touch. If this were in your stores, I have a feeling you would have a hard time keeping it in stock. I am curious as to why this is so unavailable."
4,nativity set,This product arrived shortly after I ordered it. It's really cute and I think the kids will enjoy it and it will last a long time.
4,missing parts,"I got this package in the mail today....it only came with two Wise Men, not three (as pictured). I'm pretty disappointed about this.However, the set is adorable and my son loves playing with it already."
4,The True Meaning of Christmas,I wanted this for my 3 yr old to help explain the real story of Christmas. She understood very well by reading the story in conjunction with acting out with the figures.Very pleased with this and our other Little People sets (we have almost all of them)for fun and durability. Even my other little one (6 months old at the time) enjoyed the animals.Cute to leave out for decoration when not in use.
5,A great nativity for your little people,"It's made just like every other Little People set you've got but this one comes w/ an important message! My kids loved to play w/ our breakable set so I ordered this for them. They play with it constantly and can reenact the trip to Bethlehem, the birth of Jesus, and the visits by the shepards and the wise men. I highly recommend this set as a FUN way to teach the kids about our wonderful saviour! Plus, it's even cute to display when the kids aren't playing with it!"
5,Excellent quality-became a year round toy,"My child received this last year (@ 9 months old) and enjoyed it so much during the Christmas season we kept it in the toy rotation all year. She often plays with this set, and as other reviewers have noted it holds up very well. Despite frequent play & washings this set still looks new after over a year of use!"
4,Cute And Durable,The Little People Christmas Story is cute and durable. It's a great way to teach my son about Christmas while having fun at the same tiime.
3,Not what I expected!,"I was very disappointed with the cost as I thought it would have sound. Of course when I went back and looked closely I found the difference in the description. But as there was only $2 difference in the sound vs non-sound , I think it was deceptive!"
4,Baby Jesus...,"My son loves to kiss Baby Jesus, and loves the nativity scene for short periods of time.. it really isn't interactive, which it isn't meant to be."
4,Great tool for teaching about Jesus Christ's birth,"My 1 1/2 year old daughter just received this as a gift and she loves to make it play ""Away in a Manger"". This is a very durable toy, like all Little People products. I am grateful that companies take time to make toys that help our children learn about our Savior, Jesus Christ. Although she is too young to understand the Christmas story right now, this toy will be around for a long time to help her father and I teach her about Jesus' birth. Have a Blessed Christmas!"
1,Terribly Overpriced,"I am sometimes disappointed with Amazon.com's decision to allow vendors who price gouge. Fisher-Price's own online store sells this same product, which is a very nice toy for toddlers, for exactly one half of the price offered here by ""Outside the Box"". Amazon's own prices are usually very competitive, but they really need to monitor vendors like this one."
5,Perfect Nativity set for children,"This is perfect for children! I wanted a Nativity set, but I knew my daughter would get into anyone I bought so I bought one for her! It's cute and she has a blast playing with it, and is learning the REAL meaning of christmas!"
2,Over priced!!!,"This toy was given as a gift. Sadly, I feel that it was a rip off! It is a great toy but should be half the cost. I don't know who is making the $$$ but go to fisher price, it is a lot cheeper!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Little People Christmas NO LIGHTS Or MUSIC,I really like all little people toys the only thing I didn't like about this is the fact that the nativity on the Fisher Price wed site has music and lights for only $5 more and my kids really like music and lights. So the additional cost is well worth it. I am sure this one is just as good but I wanted the additional things included. Check it out before you purchase this item! Good luck!
3,disappointed in the change,"I bought the First FP Little People Nativity set a couple years ago for my granddaughters, who loved that they could enjoy the song Away in a Manger when they pushed the angel. I bought a second set last year for my grandsons with the same features. So I expected the same when I bought this year's set for my youngest granddaughter. I was so disappointed to see that there is no music. That really was the highlight of this toy.Otherwise it's just another FP little people set..."
4,This is not the 2003 edition .........,"I must say the nativity is just as I had imagined, except for one disappointing detail. I had received a 2003 Fisher-Price catalog and thougth I was ordering the nativity for 2003. The 2003 nativity has a star that lights up when the angel is placed on top of the stable and it also will play, ""Away In A Manger"". The 2002 edition does not. I was just expecting something else. Buyer Beware if you are looking for the 2003 ......... this is not it! I am trying to decide if I should return. Bottom line, ""Jesus is the reason for the season..."" and simple might be best!"
5,Absolutely Perfect,"Thank you so much for offering this item. I have two grandsons, age 1 and 3 years. I wanted to be able to share the Christmas story one on one with them and let them enjoy touching and relating to it. Too often we offer them Christian stories and they are abstract to them at this age....but I love the hands-on availability of this item. Safe/delightful....highly recommend for sharing with your young children."
1,Not What I Expected.,"It was not at all comparable to similar products offered. It was very disappointing to pay just as much as a set that included much more. I sent the product back and ordered a better set for less money, which I'll have to give to my grandkids next Christmas."
5,Lovely,lovely toy and really fast the time to received thatFisher Price Little People a Christmas Story (White Shipper Box)
4,Where are the Shepherds?,The real Christmas story had Shepherds come visit baby Jesus in the stable the night He was born. It would be nice if Fisher price could make some shepherds to supplement this toy-I would buy it. For info-the Wise men (or Magi) didn't actually catch up to Jesus until He was a toddler (under 2) Living in a house in Bethlehem. Read your Bible closer- Matthew 2 and Luke 2
1,Look at this closely!!!,This toy is very disappointing if you are expecting the Nativity Scene in the Fisher Price Catalog. I am returning the one I got for myself and the one I purchased as a gift. I'm very dissatisfied.
2,Grandma's opinion,"This I offer as a Grandma/owner of every Fisher-Price ""LITTLE PEOPLE"" playset made in the past six (6) years: the one called ""Little People Deluxe Christmas Story"" listed in the Fisher-Price 2003 Catalog at $30 has all the ""bells and whistles"" and is the one you will bring out every Christmas for generations. The one listed at Amazon/toysrus is made by Fisher-Price but geared for a child up to age three (3). If you have a toddler group it is perfect without batteries. I hope this helps with your shopping as I love the LITTLE PEOPLE sets and could write about them all day! God bless you ""multi-tasking"" shoppers; believe me it gets easier when your the granny!"
5,A good nativity scene that you don't have to worry about,"My kids were always very interested in my porcelain nativity scene, so I purchased this the first time I saw it on the market. It is a great toy that can give a child hands on religion lessons."
4,"Great Toy, Outrageous Price","A wonderful toy, but available from Toys-R-Us for $24.99 with free shipping. This merchant should be ashamed of itself for gouging like this!"
4,Cute but stable too small,"I just got this in and was surprised by how small the stable was. I was expecting it to be taller and bigger, but the figures still fit inside. Otherwise, the pieces were very cute and I look forward to telling my daughter all about it!"
5,Kids LOVE to re-enact the Nativity story!!,"I bought one of these for my children last year and they absolutely LOVED it! We re-enact the nativity story as a family every year on Christmas Eve and this toy lets them ""practice"" the story throughout the month of December. It helps remind them of the true meaning of Christmas and helps keep the Christmas spirit in our home. Easy to wash---put little people in a mesh bag and put it in the dishwasher. Durable plastic people don't break. And my kids tend to leave my breakable nativities alone since they now have one of their own to play with. Great buy!"
1,Disappointed,"After purchasing 3 of the musical nativity sets last Christmas, I wanted to purchase 4 more this year; however, when I received them and saw that there was no music, that the packaging was not attractive and the stable seems smaller, I am going to have to go through the trouble of returning all of them. I am not a happy camper!"
3,Not the Nativity Set I had expected,"I wish I had done a little more research before buying this Nativity set. The toy itself is acceptable, but this particular set from this seller is overpriced. You can get a similar set that plays music and has more pieces for and equal or even lower price from other sellers or stores. In fact, my daughter is accustomed to the one that plays music and has more pieces from her school and when she opened this one on Christmas morning, she thought it was broken. Ugh! Her reaction only confirmed my disappointment with my purchase. I'm sure I'd have been fine with it if I hadn't realized that I paid too much for the basic set."
3,Not the full-sized set,"I thought this was the same set sold elsewhere but in a basic white box. It doesn't light up or play music and it has few pieces - no fences, no cart for the donkey. You can't always go by reviews because products can change over time - the description really needs to be perfectly clear that this is NOT the same set you will find elsewhere. If you do a search odds are you will find a Christian book store type site selling the full sized set for less money than here. It's not fair to give an assessment of price being in the thick of Christmas shopping - Amazon prices seem to change by the hour this time of year - but as of right now, Amazon is NOT the ideal place to buy this set. Do a little searching and be sure you know what you are getting. If all you want is a little something for under your tree, this will do the job - but the other set has more pieces and odds are you can find it for the same price or less."
2,Where's Joseph?,"My 3 year old twin daughters love Little People playsets, so I thought this would be the perfect Nativity set for them to play with and learn the story of Christmas. Clearly the designers of this toy forgot to actually READ the nativity story first though as there is no Joseph, just Mary, the baby Jesus, the angel, three wise men, one shepherd and four animals. He may have only been the earthly father of Jesus, but Joseph was very much present on the night of Jesus's birth so should have been included. Perfectly fine toy to play with, but not a good example of a Nativity Scene."
4,No complaints,"It works and is attractive. It is not particularly heavy but it is of reasonable quality and I am satisfied with it. I would feel better about its potential lifespan if it were made of heavier metal but so far, so good. It was a little fussy to install."
1,Not Compatible with W880i,Be careful. This charger does not work with W880i even though it says so in the product description.
3,"Fast delivery, but not exactly what we needed","First of all I want to say that the delivery came in the time promised. :)I purchased this fuel pump online for my husband's 1998 GMC Jimmy. When he removed the old fuel pump and started to replace it with the new, he then realized that there was suppose to be a little hose attached to one end. He went to a nearby car mechanic and also a parts store and was told by both that you can't just buy the hose and connect it. With this particular vehicle the hose has to be attached to the fuel pump.This fuel pump may work for other vehicles, just not on the 1998 GMC Jimmy. Out of fairness to the people I bought it from, I have not contacted them yet about this issue. I will send the fuel pump back with a letter."
1,Not enough pressure,"Bought for my 99 tahoe and wouldnt hold the correct amount of pressure. Easier to go to a parts store locally so if the problem arises again, its a quick exchange."
3,not as good as other Korean movies under this category,"I do like the type of movie where the suspense is constantly moving within the plot of it. For that, I have to say Old Boy is the best. In terms of goriness, I might go for: I Saw The Devil. For plot, I say, Mother and Old Boy, as well. All of these are excellent Korean movies where plot, action and suspense keep the audience glued to the chair. This movie has some of the raw goriness characteristic in the Korean Thrillers, but the whole movie was not at the level of the others I just mentioned. Regarding a movie based on a real crime story, I must to admit that I will go for Memories of a Murder than for Missing. Lastly, This review is for those fans of the Korean thriller movies as they will understand my comparisons."
5,Exile-Greatest Hits,"I grew up listening to this music. If I had a dime (maybe a quarter) for every time I danced to an Exile song, I would not have to worry about my 401K.....I love their music today like I did then.And when they sang with Trace, OMG, I almost had a 'moment'.I would tell anyone to buy this one!!"
5,Great purchase,Really enjoyed this CD... brought back some good memories of great 80's country music. You won't be disaapointed with this CD.
1,bad mp3s,"The samples were fine, but the full versions sound like they recorded off of scratchy vinyl."
4,"80's country at it's finest. To the heart, Fun.","Exile, a band that started out as a smooth rock band of the 70's, then slid across into the country category in the 80's. Their smooth harmonny along with catchy lyrics makes this greatest hits a must have for an Exile fan. I saw these guys at a concert in Kansas City a few years ago and instantly fell in love with their music. Their voices are perfection and their version of People Get Ready will leave you with goosebumps. This CD showcases their superb writing, singing and musical ability. For those of us who love Mid 80's country, before the Garth Brooks Mega Marketing Era, this is a real treat for your ears."
2,re-recordings,"All of the songs are re-recordings, but since they were recorded back in the day they are better quality than most re-records. They still are not the radio versions that one should expect from a greatest hits album."
2,"Sorry to disagree with the other reviewers, but...","I bought this book instead of the Goleman book because all the reviewers indicated that the Goleman book was lacking in practical advice as to how to apply the theory to achieve results in your life.Unfortunately, I found 7 Steps to Emotional Intelligence even less useful due to the extremely technical, academic presentation style and the focus on Neuro Linguistic Programming. I didn't realize I was buying an NLP book...I thought this would be primarily a book about emotional intelligence.Being an engineer, academic or technical presentation styles are usually not a problem for me, but I just found that I didn't want to spend 90% of my time comprehending NLP and only 10% learning about emotional intelligence.If you are already very familiar with NLP, this book may be what you are looking for. If not, you may be disappointed, as I was."
5,Work great.,Nails are smooth and work well with Bostich nailer. Came in a large heavy box but rolls are well arranged and separated by cardboard.
3,Rainy NYC streets: It's warfare!,"I bought these boots because I walk 20-30 minutes to work each day in New York City. Usually it's lovely, but when it's raining, it's hell. By the time I get to work I am soaked through. These boots do the trick. Just wipe out the inside before wearing, as they got a weird green powder all over my pants. That aside, they really help me to combat the rain and puddles."
4,Boots,I have not had to wear these boots but they look and feel fine. I orderd my shoe size and have room for extra warm socks.
1,No Good,"The Tread is to wide, Gravel gets trapped between the Treads, They are great if you like dragging gravel all over the house and Scratching the floor.Gravel gets stuck between the treads and you have to pry it out with a screw driver."
4,Assembly issues,"I got my grill very quickly. It looks great after I assembled it. The assembly process however was horrible. The instructions were by no means clear. I am usually very good at figuring out assemblies, but this was a mess! I literally had to assemble it on my own, which wasn't a pleasant experience. If you are handy with tools and good at solving puzzles, go for it!"
5,"Chiodi, The art of Building People","I am a retired Respiratory Therapist. Stained glass has been my passion for the last 6 yrs. I needed a renewal of my motivation and Mitch's book was just the ticket. Tool # 1, showed me what particular areas that I needed to target. Time management has always been an issue as well. Tool # 18-22 helped to identify why I have lost some of my motivation, and ""started me up"" again. I developed a plan of attack. ""The Art Of Building People"" can help us to use our time efficiently and ferverently. I liked Mitch's simple approach and thought provoking questions at the end of each ""Tool Chapter"". I will highly recommend this book to all my friends. Donna Doud."
1,Poor Customer Service,"Perhaps I got a lemon, but my camera took poor quality shots, the viewfinder was off center, and the zoom broke. I sent it in to Olympus for warranty repair, and they said the camera was damaged by impact and refused to repair. I sent it back, and they have now agreed to rebuild, but the process has taken 2 months, and I still don't have my camera back. I judge a company's products on how they handle problems. I will never buy Olympus again. Perhaps my problem was the rare exception, since I bought based on Amazon recommendations, but I wanted to share my story."
2,Not Recommended,"I loved the features on this camera when I first purchased it. However, on only the 2nd or 3rd roll of film, I noticed the pictures (particulary the zoom pictures) were fuzzy. Olympus diagnosed the problem as the lens being off center. Now only 2 years later, the lens cover has broken off and the motor is not working properly. I am now looking for a new camera, but definately not an Olympus."
3,nice but didn't last,"They were a great set of shorts - while they lasted. Mine lasted about 10 months. I'm new to Tri and only ran 2 races in 2007 but, I trainined 4-5 days a week. The material around the Chamis seams in the rear and front started ""running"" almost like a pair of my wifes nylons ""Run"". My first thought was that I got a size too small however, after rechecking, I was well within their waist size guidance. I did wear them in a pool about 3 times a month but rinsed them out promptly - that may have been the problem OR, the compression may be too much for the seams."
2,Unhappy,"Purchased this volley ball set for my daughter's graduation party. Sear's had the same one for much more money, so we figured why not buy on Amazon.com? Purchasing from Amazon.com is fine, however, this particular set was a major dissapointment. Poles were too flimsy, hooks that held net to the poles broke too easily. Unfortunately we did get severe wind and only got one game in before things fell apart. I guess you get what you pay for! Too bad!"
3,Unable to give true review,I am unable to give a true review on the product due to the volleyball was damaged upon receipt and unable to hold air. However the customer service was absolutely fantastic! So I would rate the customer service a 5 star!
4,Good Book for beginning teachers,I found this book to be very good for the first year teacher (and for Pre-Service teachers also). The book has a lot of ideas to use in the classrooms.
4,Helfpul for First Timers,"Overall, I found this book helpful for a first-time teacher. I recently returned to reaching after a 10 year career in the Arts, and was overhelmed by how things had changed. This book does a pretty good job of laying out what you need to do and know to make it as a first year teacher.It won't necessarily make you a better teacher (only practice can do that), but it can make an impact in your life by letting you realize that a lot of others have been through this before."
3,"Smells nice, but fades fast","I really like the smell of this perfume, but it doesn't last long. Not sure if it's just me, would recommend as a sexy perfume for night."
2,Not what the title suggests,My one favourite food is popcorn and this has nothing to do with it at all. I was hoping for a review of all the best places to get popcorn but it turn out this is a load of rubbish about Marketing which is actually quite inaccurate! Stick to Kotler he actually does know his stuff although sadly he's never written about popcorn!
1,Wrong wrong wrong,"Someone should actually read this book before reviewing it. Like Bill Gates, Popcorn is as wrong as she is right. Visionary? I'll tell you who the visionary is: Ted Nelson, not Faith. Cocooning? It never actually happened as Popcorn describes it."
2,Gravel Elevator Music,"Joe needs to stick to high energy rock. Except for ""Chain of Fools"", this album is all elevator music in a gravel pit. Get the ""Ultimate Collection"" instead."
1,Disappointed,"Let me say right off hand, I am a huge fan of Joe Cocker. This album, however seemed to be ""phoned in."" Most of the songs were all wrong for Joe especially James Taylor's ""I don't Want to be Lonely Tonight."" One of the worst things on an 11 song album was that the song at the beginning and end was the same song! ""Chain"" was more of what Cocker usually does well, but a whole album wasn't worth one good song."
4,Torches in the Twilight,"If you have an ear for the world-weary, this one's for you. Joe has selected a variety of old standards which reflect the perspective of someone who has lived a life filled with love, loss and laughter. The spareness of the vocals, combined with the lushness of the musical arrangements, evoke memories for those of us who have some of life's experiences under our belts.If you don't feel on the verge of tears when listening to his heart-wrenching version of U2's ""One"", you still have some living to do. Well worth the investment in both time and money."
2,Just search internet,"The book has references to the text, but doesn`t have the specific entries next to the words so you`re constantly going back and forth between reading and flipping to back pages. Overall a dry read like that of a student paper. Whatever search engine you use just type in Voynich Manuscript and print what comes up (.......believe me it`ll be a book unto itself.)"
2,Make sure you order the right size!,"It's a nice looking steering wheel cover, but it comes just a little smaller than normal. I have done these many times in the past but just cant get this one onto the steering wheel. Make sure you get the right size!"
4,Nice features,"I really liked a really cool feature on this camera. The viewfinder contains a crossbar which should be placed at the object you want to focus. Then you can depress the shutter button slightly and move the camera - it would not refocus. Very useful if the objects of interest are not at the centre of your photograph.Quartz date printing is good. No accessories are provided, you'll have to buy the case, batteries and film yourself.I'd recommend this camera if all you need is point-and-shoot with reasonable zoom."
1,Bad choice,"I have always heard good things about the Olympus brand so I assumed when I bought this camera that I would be happy with it. Three weeks after purchasing it the zoom quit working. I called the Olympus customer service but I found then very unhelpful. I brought it back to the store and exchanged it for a new one of the exact same model. I immediatly put batteries in and tried it out but this one was broke too with the same problem! So, two cameras in a row were broke, one after three weeks, one already when I purchased it. I finally took it back to the store and exchanged it for a different brand of camera. I'm not impressed with this camera!Sara"
5,Perfect for my Saab 9-3,Worked perfectly to adapt the connector in my 1999 Saab 9-3 to an after market pioneer radio.
3,She hated it!,"Besides the fact that I had to request for redelivery and the package arrived well after the anticipated arrival time, the product itself was undamaged, appeared durable, and everything was as expected. It was even larger than I thought. It's too bad my girlfriend hated it because of the 'patchwork' design."
4,The Sound Comes Alive,"Picked this up to accompany the MultiManPublishing/The Gamers board game of the same title (multimanpublishing.com / gamersarchive.net).Knew nothing of the battle before reading this.It evokes the battle itself brilliantly - as well as setting the strategic scene of the weeks leading up to the battle, and putting its outcome in the broader context of the western theatre.I learned a lot and found doing so a pleasure.Highly recommended."
5,The Chickamauga Challenge,"I love this book! I ordered it on paperback and it seems to be about 700 pages with small print, which gives great detail into the Battle of Chickamauga, as Cozzens does with all his books. It also has drawn pictures of some of the characters and the battle itself, with detailed maps of the fighting as best as you can get. Even though the Confederates claimed a victory and drove the Union troops off the field, their ""victory"" cost them over 18,000 fighting men that couldn't be replaced and failed to follow up the pursuit of retreating Yankee troops, who lost about 16,000 men as they retreated to Chattanooga. And the book gives great insight into the heroics of Virginia-born Major-General George Thomas, whose Union command saved the routed army from any further disaster. Peter Cozzens did great research and drama into this battle itself. 5 stars all the way!"
2,Bureaucratic-style prose makes for a very boring read,"Slogging through this thick and stilted text, one gets the opinion that Peter Cozzens wrote this piece for a governmental bureau rather than for the civil war reader. Although detailed, the author's writing style is so incredibly laborious and boring that it can not be digested in anything less than small doses. Reading is supposed to be informative and fun, although you can forget the fun part when reading Cozzens. What's more, the analysis is also lacking."
3,"Not as bad as ""No Better Place to Die""","Solzhenitsyn? I've read Solzhenitsyn and, sir, Cozzens is no Solzhenitsyn. Seriously, Cozzens is not a good writer. This book doesn't drag as badly as ""No Better Place to Die"" but it is still not very good. I give a grudging nod to the research."
3,Chickamuaga,"I first read this book while working at Chickamauga &Chattanooga; National Military Park. Overall, I would say that the book is worth purchasing, and in addition, it definetely has some excellent points. However, without going into too much detail, the book does have some flaws. First, the book is heavily biased towards the Union forces, and as such, tends to give moreof the Union perspective throughout the book. If you are looking for a book that equally covers both, C.S. and U.S. operations, well, you might be a bit dissapointed. Furthermore, he fails to mention the use of elements of Walker's Reserve Corps, Army of Tennessee, on the final push against Snodgrass and Horseshoe ridge.Plus sides to this book are also numerous: Best published work on Chickamauga so far, excellent maps, and a plethora of other bonus material. I am waiting for someone to write a new history of the battle of Chickamauga. There is so much to write about, and so little to keep someone from doing so."
3,dw7737,"Read info on your site and have 12"" Dewalt portable saw 1' arbor with a 3500rpm or more would have to read specs again. The problem is on the literature with the blade it is designed for low rpms info not readily available but it is approximately 15or1600rpms max.haven't had a chance to find saw blade will work with but even my dewalt chop saw is 3500rpms.Would not have purchased if rpms were listed."
2,First printer I've ever had that broke,"As with others, I bought the 3820 after Consumer Reports rated it a ""Best Buy."" Worked fine for about 1.5 years, now it is down with a ""carriage stall."" Repair flat rate is about the cost of a new printer. Since I have several ink cartridges left over, I was looking around to see if there was another one for sale. Unfortunately (or fortunately, I guess) I ran across these mediocre reviews. Now I guess I'll buy something else.This is my first disapointment with HP products, I certainly feel a broken and unrepairable printer after just a year and a half is unacceptable.Other than the fact that it was noisy and slow, for the price, text printing was very good and color printing was good. Oh, yeah, my back door broke off too. Clear shipping tape fixes that.HP tech support and chat was very good walking me through the troubleshooting. Unfortunately, this was a fatal problem."
1,"Good Printer, but only for 2 months....","Earlier this year, I purchased the HP Deskjet 3820 to go along with my new Gateway 500SE computer, which runs on the Windows XP operating system.The good news:Print quality is very good.Software is easy to install.Connecting the hardware is simple.The bad news:The printer only worked for about 2 months. All of a sudden, it wouldn't print anymore! I tried everything I could think of to get it going again (contacted the HP help desk, uninstalled and then reinstalled the printer software, fiddled with all the connections, etc.), but could not get the printer to work. I tried for 7 weeks (I'm a patient man), but to no avail.I finally went out and purchased an Epson Stylus C82, and so far, so good."
1,"Ok printer, mechanical problems though.","I have been using this printer long enough to get through about 2 new cartridge purchaes. The quality of the prints is fine, on good paper you get a really nice picture out of it. The problem is like others on the site, the cartridge holder slid all the way to the right and is now jammed. With a little bit of wiggling it came free, but it now gives constant carriage errors. And after multiple conversations with HP the only thing they have to offer is to bring it in for repair (about 80$) or buy a new printer..... THANKS HP!!!"
3,I must be in the minority,"After going through all the reviews I was amazed to see so many who have had problems. Right after buying mine I saw a review about how a person had many jamming problems and wouldn't recommend this printer, so I was a little worried. But I have had the printer about a year and two months now and have had zero problems. No jamming, no problems with indicating the cartridges are empty when they are not, etc. My printer gets moved around to various places in the house as it is used with a laptop. I paid about $51.00 for it new and was pleased with how it performed over an older model HP we still have. This doesn't mean you should consider this product, but that there are a few that have done well."
2,"Prints okay, but it needs to be reinstalled often","This printer came with a friend's HP Pavilion with XP Home. He's had it for about 6 months and we've reinstalled it about 6 times!! When it works it prints okay, but for whatever reason it just disappears from the computer. I haven't tracked down a new driver, so I don't know what the problem is. I normally recommend HP printers, but so far I'm not impressed with this thing."
4,It prints,"You have to wonder exactly how you can manufacture plastic so thin, brittle and [poorly made]....but HP has got it down. This is my 4th hp printer and you just have to shake your head as each one is [worse] than the last. Remember when printers were well made, had metal in them?...oh well. But it prints, it will last a couple of years....You have to wonder what it is doing when you hit the print button. It whirls, cracks, makes a few R2D2 sounds and just when you think it wont print something happens and the paper moves. Sort of like sweating at an ATM machine. The price is right, although last week it was [less] and I noticed they raised it. Oh and don't forget to move the paper tab to the left. Took me forever to figure out how to get the paper in the thing."
1,HP is now refusing to replace this printer,"This printer died on me last week in exactly the same way as has been widely reported here and other forums (such as fixyourownprinter.com). I contacted HP telephone support, mentioning that there were numerous reports on the Internet of them replacing this printer even though it was out of warranty. The telephone representative evaded acknowledging this, and tried very hard to sell me a new printer. I contacted online support. The online support representative at least did acknowledge that the reports of free replacements were true. But he said that this policy had been discontinued as of December 2005. When I asked why he said ""Sorry, I don't have the details, as this is a decision of the higher ups."" He tried to sell me a new printer too."
1,Piece of junk,"I got this printer with my iBook and it stopped working after a couple of months. I used to have an old HP LaserJet printer and it lasted over 10 years. I called HP support and they said that they'd give me a 15 percent discount on a new printer, but I am not going to take the chance on any more of their equipment. I am very disappointed in this printer and in HP."
1,Piece of Crap.,"Lasted for two black printer cartriges. Now it is a paper weight. Back door fell off long ago because the tabs broke, after the warranty expired of course, so I rebuilt the tabs myself using super glue and it worked fine again until it just decided it wouldn't accept new printer cartriges anymore. DO NOT BUY. This is a shoddily made product. Welcome to the new era at HPQ."
1,If its free okay but do not buy!,"I got this printer with the purchase of an Apple Ibook. It worked great for about 6 months. Since then I have had nothing but jams, grindings noises, and finially failure. I am very disapointed with this HP product. I buy only Apple computers and have never had an issue with an HP printer until this one. I have had Epson and Canon printers that have not held up with my macs. It was cheap so I got some use out of it but would not advise anyone to buy it."
1,"Noisy, unreliable, absolute junk",This is my 4th HP printer purchase.I bought this and another 3820 for my daughter as UVA annointed it as their preferred printer. Mine conked out into its 2nd cartridge and my daughter tells me the students at UVA have problems with & hate theirs.No more HP for me -- I had been willing to overpay for their cartridges as the printers were economical & reliable. $10 depreciation to $0 is a bit excessive (amortization of the printer alone -- no ink included)
3,Worked pretty well - for a while,"I have just joined the legions of HP Deskjet 3820 owner's whose machines just crapped out on them. I gave it a 3 out of 5 because it was inexpensive and it did work for almost a year.On glossy paper, the print looks good. It is definitely not ""professional"" quality, but I have used it to produce brochures and flyers with good success.The ink is expensive - although that is almost always the case with the inkjets - HUGE profit center for those guys.All in all, for what you pay, I guess this printer is not a bad deal."
1,One of the worst printers I have ever used!,This printer came free after a mail-in rebate and I guess you get what you pay for. With this printer you can not print business cards or on any paper other than light weight printer paper. It ALWAYS pulls in two or more sheets of paper and I must feed in one sheet at a time. It is more of a hassle than it is worth. :-) IT WAS FREE
1,This printer is garbage,Stopped working when first black ink cartridge ran dry. Did some research on web and found this to be common problem. Called HP but 90 day warrenty had just expired. BUYER BEWARE.
2,Great Printing--for about a year...,"After purchasing this printer, I was very happy with the photo-prints and plain paper prints it made.Then, about four months ago, it developed a loud, squealing noise when it picked up the paper. Last month, it started telling me the black cartridge was empty even though I had just replaced it with a new one. I followed the instructions to re-install it, and a few uses later the same problem reappared. At least, it kept on making excellent prints.This week, it quit. It gave me an error saying there was a paper jam when there was not. The print cartridges are stuck to the right.It quit in its 4th black ink cartridge. Other people appear to have similar experiences with this model.At this point, I cannot recommend this printer."
2,I give it 2 stars because,while it lasted it printed nice pictures clear and beautiful. Much better then my old Canon BJC-6000 which had stopped working after two years or so. But this printer the HP 3820 only lasted for about a year and 3 months then just recently died. It kept saying there was no ink and the print mechanism was jammed. Don't know how it could be jammed when it wasn't used recently. I understand the ink drying up but this? I didn't want to bother with it so now I'm in the process of looking for a new printer. After reading so many reviews about HP's quality I don't think I'll be buying an HP again any time soon.
2,3820 Buged,After a short time using my 3820 is refused to print with the Msg. that the black ink cartridge was empty. I went out and purchased a new HP brand cartridge and installed it...it continued to give me the same Msg. so I took the new cartridge back and exchanged it for another new one...same thing..refused to print with the message that the cartridge was no good. I'm about to throw it out...any comments or suggestions as to what I might due?
1,My cog broke...,"...it's all about http://www.fixmybrokenprinter.com/ . That site deals with the cog failure that most everyone seems to complain about, myself included. Blinking lights, paper feeding, but no printing."
1,DON'T BUY THE MISTAKE OF YOUR LIFE,"At first i was happy with this crap, but then it was time to replace the black ink, and things went wrong.Lights flashing ..paper jams...there was NO WAY to make it print again. The Technical Support Chat tried helping. but all in all no one knew what to do.My advice: D O N T B U Y IT YOU WILL REGRET IT ."
2,PIECE OF JUNK,"Very temperamental, quirky printer. DO NOT BUY IT. Once you have a paper jam, chances are it will never work again. I was always having to uninstall/re-install the software after it would spit out endless sheets filled with hieroglyphics! Another crappy product from HP. Check out other complaints at: www.fixyourownprinter.com"
3,Back door jammin,"The printer is OK in most regards. The ink cartridge lasts a lot longer than Cannon printers I've had in the past. However, there is this door in the back that is built flimsily and I don't know what happened, but something broke on it and it won't stay closed. This causes paper jams galore. I had to remedy the problem with scotch tape. It works fine now with a permanent band-aid."
1,defective parts liability,"I bought a Hewlett Packard 3820 Deskjet printer 1 1/2 years ago, and recently, a defective part was discovered in mine,and 5 other like models in the store that I purchased it. I was told that it could take a month to order this part. I have already been without a printer 3 weeks, so this is a great inconvenience and dissappointment in that I thought this a very well rated product. I realize that any warrenty on parts has run out, but a company that finds a major defective part in one of its products, I think, has a responsibility to the consumer to reach some kind of an agreement that is agreeable to both. The company I bought it from (a small computer store) shouldnt be liable for a problem of this kind."
1,Stops working after ink runs out!,"I had the same experience as other reviewers, after the first ink cartridge runs out, it stops working."
1,This printer works fine but drinks ink.,"I purchased it yesterday for my office, and have printed a dozen checks and maybe a dozen other reports. The cartridges are about 2/3 full today. At this rate I will be replacing ink cartridges every week. What an absolute rip off! Now I know why the printer is inexpensive. Thay make their money off of the ink."
1,It's the pits!,"I've had 3 Epson's and now 2 hp's. This 3820 is absolutely the worst! It is terribly slow. HP advertises it to print 12ppm in B&W plain ordinary letter type media... How about one page in 70 seconds -- that's 1 minute and 20 seconds! HP's tech support suggested that I get a better quality USB connecting cable.. This I did and it improved it somewhat... but way too slow!Bad choice...Gene RhodesSeattle, WA"
4,I'm glad with this printer,"I got the HP 3820 some weeks ago and I'm satisfied with it, fast printing, a pretty good quality, well, if you're thinking to prints 70% photos and 30% text, this is not your printer, get a HP Photosmart. At this moment, I rate this item with 5 stars , but...yeah, has a litte of crack sounds (but I don't think it is too important), wait about 20 seconds before start to print, not too much ink, but I'm think it is enough.Finally, how I said, I'm glad with it to print documents with a good quality and somes photos.I choosed this printer and not the other options that I have:Epson C62, and any Canon model... by these reasons: 4 STARS."
1,Poor Quality,"This printer is very cheaply made. After only a month, the snaps that keep the back door attached broke and since the rollers are attached to this piece, the printer could not print straight. I had to use duct tape to keep the thing together. It is poorly made and not worth the money. Don't waste your money on this printer."
4,Crisp Color Pictures,"Hi! I've never used this printer, but anything that prints out brilliant color pictures is for me. An indcator that you need more ink is a special add-on feature.It looks nice, it doesn't take up a lot of room and it prints faster than the one I have at home.Without using it, if I had the [$] and some odd to pay for it I would. Sincerely yours, Julie"
2,Mine broke too.,"With the flashing lights and the carriage stuck to the right. Fortunately for me HP is sending out a replacement printer for free, but I'm without a printer for a few weeks now working on writing projects! AGH!"
2,Only lasted 1.5 years. Really dissapointed!!,"I bought it new in 6/03 and in 12/04 the carriage return froze up and would no longer move. I called the HP help desk and was told it needed to be serviced so I decided to save my money and buy a new printer instead. It would probably cost me more to have it fixed than to get a new one. I am really dissapointed! I expected more from a product by HP. One note* When it did work, it had great print quality, but a little noisy."
2,Mediocre,"I made the mistake of buying this printer, and after fighting with jams, so-so print quality, and an indifferent customer service rep, I switched to a Canon S300. Now I have a nice printer."
2,Works well when it works,"I bought this printer in June of 2003, and have had to return it for a replacement three times! First time it lost communication with the black ink cartridge, second time, the replacement started printing crooked and it made a lot of noise. It also ate a page of labels which was a pain to clean out. The third printer I received wouldn't print the whole document. Just a portion would be printed and sometimes it would just eject a blank page. The instant support over the web was manned by people who spoke broken English, but they were prompt and polite (to be fair). I think that HP is having trouble producing commodity items of this sort. Buyer beware!"
2,HP 3820 Service Station Gear Problem,"HP has had big problems with the HP3820. The Service Station Gears within the machine were not designed to withhold stress on the printer carriage. When the carriage is pushed - these gears easily break. HP does not sell these gears. I did find them on eBay. A search of ""HP 3820 Service Station Gears"" should get you there. Most of the problems described point towards these gears. Hope this helps."
1,Good while it lasted--but a lemon,"This printer was noisy but pretty effective while it worked for almost 2 years. Great photo quality and very user-friendly. However, it died after 23 months because of the cog problem that so many others experience, where the lights blink and the cartridges slam to the left. I got duped into buying a low cost (yet expensive cartridge) printer. My next printer will be definitely more than the $110 I paid for the 3820, and hopefully will last longer."
1,don't buy this printer!!!,"hewlett packard sells it knowing it will become defective within a short period of time. they should market it as a ""disposable printer"" because that's what it is. they even tried to sell me a $30 warranty when i called for support. the warranty, it turns out, is for only two weeks, and doesn't cover parts or service. basically, they knew the printer was f!?*&d and wanted to milk me for a two week offer for phone support. what a bad company!"
5,Genuinely good,"There's no way to review a familiar windows OS than ""it works"" and ""does not work"". This one works, and it's a genuine one. That's all you need to know if you need this."
1,It is past the Free Vista upgrade deadline.,"well, this xp mce software comes w/ a form for free upgrade to Windows Vista Home Premium, but the expire date was 3/31/2007. so if u buy it, you'll get excited, but not satisfied, for Vista upgrade option. So, this product is out of date, thus, overpriced, and not recommened."
3,Not impressed,"I was not impressed with this video. I found it difficult to understand what the instructor was saying, I feel she is speaking to fast at times when switching positions. The camera is focused on her and at times you do not see the poses being performed.Perhaps those who been doing yoga for some time would find this a better paced video."
4,A great flow,"This video introduces you to Taylor's smooth and seamless flow, and to her positive, ""you can do it too"" attitude. If you are experienced with yoga practice and, especially if you don't live near the Boston area and can't make it into her studio, it is worth owning Taylor's first video. The sequence that she has developed is beautiful- you will love the feel of the poses rolling into and out of each other; it is an athletic, cathartic dance. The video workout is also suitable for beginners because of Taylor's easy to follow instructions and modifications. Having done many yoga videos at home, one of the things I find difficult is the lack of reminders to breathe- when breath is actually central to yoga. This is precisely what makes The Prana Power Yoga tape a standout from the others: Taylor's consistent queuing for the breath. You will find yourself actually coming up with ways to get your workout in rather than coming up with excuses on how to get out of it!"
5,"Engaging, energizing and fun yoga practice","This DVD has been a great addition to my home exercise routine. I am somewhat new to power yoga and have been delighted to see that, not only do I feel more flexible and relaxed after each practice, I also feel like I got a real workout. I was able to pick up the basics of the flow in just one session and Taylor does a great job of pointing out how to modify the postures to accommodate special needs (bad lower back, etc.) I particularly like Taylor's emphasis on the mental aspects of yoga practice, as opposed to focusing on every little technical detail of the poses. My other yoga tapes spend so much time focusing on where to put your foot, etc. that I get distracted from the actual flow of the practice. I would highly recommend this DVD to folks interested in beginning/improving their power yoga practice or simply adding a new option to their home exercise routine."
1,DON'T BOTHER!!!,"I have been doing Yoga for several years, and purchased this video for the purpose of supplementing my regular practice. Unfortunately, this DVD did not nearly live up to my expectations. I found Taylor's instructions to be greatly lacking in all respects. Her rapid-fire, fast-passed delivery as well at her annoying counting made it extremely difficult to get through the video, and more importantly, to get a proper workout. The video would have been much more beneficial if the focus had been on the poses rather than the close-up's of Taylor where the poses were impossible to view. Skip this one -there are much better Yoga DVD's out there. Don't waste your time or your money!!"
4,Strong orthopedics,"I've had prescription plastic orthopedics and these are kind of like those. I have flat feet and get severe pain in my legs and hips at the end of the day sometimes. These are good because they're pretty hard, unlike those foam insoles. I recommend them for the price, if they help it will be worth it. If they don't, its cheaper than insoles that cost $200 and don't feel much different.. I've bought 2 pairs over the years and wear them every few days. Try them..."
1,Stay Away!!!!!,"These were absolutely horrible. They made my feet ached 10 times worse. I tried everything to make them work better (added cushion on top, used the lowest arch, etc) and nothing made them perform better. Atrocious. Painful. No way to get a refund. Just a gimmick that I got suckered into. If your feet hurt, see a doc, do some specific feet stretches and rest. Dont buy garbage like I did!"
4,These are worth it.,"I bought these because I have flat feet. They have helped my feet not hurt so much in my shoes. My only complaint about this product is the velcro tabs that come with it, do NOT stay attached in the shoe. I don't know if they will fix my flat feet, but they do feel better."
2,Will probably help some people but not my flat feet.,"Despite the two stars I give them, I will say these inserts are well made. For those who are able to use them they will probably work well. Despite it stating specifically on their web site that these supports will help flat footed people, I find them too painful to wear.My problem is shin pain from overpronation caused by flat feet (or at least arches that flatten out when I walk or run ). Using these is like having large, smooth rocks in my shoes. Even with the lowest arch insert they act as a fulcrum that my feet rock back and forth over. I wore them for about a half hour each morning for over a month and my feet would still hurt each time I put my shoes on.I think the problem is that the arch inserts are made of hard, inflexible plastic. For me at least there needs to be some give, without that they are unwearable for me."
1,Uncomfortable,"I have wore orthotics for many years but I saw these and decided to give them a try. I found even the low arch was much to high, tried them for two weeks and they just didn't relax as I expected they would. My daughter tried them as well and found the same. Had to take them out."
2,Pleased with Walk Fit,This is my 2nd purchase of this product and they do wonders for me. My old ones were over 2 yrs old and getting a little worn. I've had problems over the years with Plantar Fachitus (heel spurs). Orthotics are a must for me.I gave it 5 stars. Not sure why is says 2.
1,WalkFit Fraudulent Company Claims,"Ordered WalkFit inserts for myself and my fiancee. Followed their instructions for about 10 days (3 days past their ""break in"" period). I couldn't wait to get them out of my shoes by the end of the day. Foot adjusted somewhat, but not that much. Same with my fiancee. Decided to return them.I should have known better at the time to buy something off of the TV, but I learned my lesson again."
4,Good review for Praxis II Biology Content Knowledge Exam,"I used this book along with the Campbell, Reese, and Mitchell Biology textbook to prepare for the Praxis II Biology Content Knowledge Exam (0235). I was able to pass the exam with an excellent score using these two resources.This book helped me to review the key information I needed for the test. The questions in this book are about as challenging as most questions on the Praxis, although there were a few more challenging questions that I would not have gotten right if I hadn't also studied the Campbell text."
3,Mostly Useful,"This book was useful when reviewing the subject, but I found a few mistakes when I compared it with my college textbook, especially in the plant chapter. Overall a good general review."
3,Cute but rather small,"My daughter wanted a Dora backpack for her fourth birthday, so I picked this one because it actually looks like the one on the show. It's probably too babyish for her, but she seems to like it. It comes complete with a map, which is conveniently secured to the backpack itself so you don't lose it. It's cute.The biggest problem is that it's really too small to hold much. Even a normal size stuffed animal won't fit without being scrunched up a bit. My daughter has a small pair of binoculars that she puts in there, along with a small stuffed animal and a snack to go on her ""adventures"" in the house. We don't take it out of the house so as not to risk getting it dirty - I don't know how well it would wash out.For the price, it's a fun toy for younger kids, but it's not much use as an actual backpack."
1,SAD MUMMY,I purchased the bag for my little girl aged 2 and a half who is super fan of Dora. I was talking to her every day about it: how she would find her kinder or her granny's house using Dora's map but we never got the bag. It never arrived. I wrote an email to the seller with my complain but got no answer. Now I am a sad mummy and will never purchase anything again in Amazon. A nasty experience. Be carefull!!!!
3,Toys fall out from the top,"I bought this backpack for a costume, but I was hoping that my daughter would be able to use it to carry her things around. I give it only three stars because the backpack does not close. The velcro closure leaves large openings on the top sides, therefore anything inside the backpack falls out if the backpack is not always help perfectly upright. This makes it impossible to use it outside the home."
3,backpack,i got this for my daughter for christmas she likes it puts different things in it the map is a neat bonus its by no means huge but its a kids toy as others have said it wont stay closed with to much stuff in it but who cares its for kids your not going camping or backpacking with it
4,Great fun!,"2 year old just loves backpack! We bought TY Beanies - Dora, Boots, and Swiper to go inside - very popular with both 2 year old and 4 year old! Backpack is large enough to hold all 3 of these items, but small enough for 2 year old to put on and carry. Quality of backpack seems like it will stand up to all the love - map seems well attached. Overall, happy with the purchase. One concern is a note I saw on one of the several Dora backpacks I researched on Amazon regarding use of cancerous materials in state of California. Not all the backpacks said this, and I'm not sure which one I actually received. This lack of clear information concerns me,especially for the fact that these materials may be used in children's toys, and especially without clear indication."
1,Don't buy this toy,"I ordered this Dora Backpack for my 18 month old, who loves Dora. We got it in the house and saw a tag on the product that says that there are materials in the product that are known to the State of California to cause cancer. Awesome. The seller wouldn't give me a refund, so we ended up just throwing this away. Avoid this purchase."
1,Too Risky,I purchased this simple looking bag pack for my niece who loves Dora the Explorer. After carefully reading tags inside bag I noticed warnings for the paint used on some of the plastic. It concerned me and I rather had not let my niece run around with such bag. I did my research on the chemical used with the paint and I sent it back ASAP. I got my money back a few weeks later. Not worth it and avoid. It's intended for kids and oddly its not as harmless as it seems. The cons heavily out weight the pros of this product. I'm sure my niece will thank me later =p .
1,Contains hazardous material!,Just bought this backpack for daughter's Birthday and did not give to her. On the tag it states that it contains material known to cause cancer or birth defects. We plan on returning immediately!
5,Perfect For Any Little One Who Loves Dora!,"With the whole Dora craze going on right now, you would think that you could find so many different versions of her back pack out there. Not true! I was thrilled when I found this one. It seems to be sturdy enough to withstand a lot of play--believe me, it will get put through the wringer with my DD. ;)She is turning 3 next week so this will be one of the main BD presents. I know that she is going to love it!Hopefully we will soon be able to find some Diego stuff too!!"
4,has it all but a star pocket,"My 3 yr old loves her Dora Back-pack. This Back-pack is the most like the one Dora has in her cartoon, but it has no star pocket. I wonder if toy makers ever actually watched the DVD's. It would be nice to have a back-pack exactly like Dora's."
4,Dora backpack is a big hit with my daughter (and her friends as well),"Nice plush backpack as advertised. Just like the one on the TV show, and it's functional as well. The only complaint is that all of my daughter's friends want it too!"
2,Sorry I bought,"This toy has no ""playful"" qualities, and it is so small that it is not a usable backpack."
5,Dora's Backpack,This little backpack is so cute and my daughter just loves it. Where ever we go the backpack is with us.
4,Nice back pack for your Dora-lover!,"The pros:1. Easy wash in the washing mahine on gentle2. Adjustable shoulder straps3. Looks just like the one on Dora's show...toddlers easily identify it4. Holds lots of stuff. When you no longer carry a diaper bag, this bag is great for putting in a diaper /wipes and even some small toys when going out for quick trips or to a restaurant!The con:1. My biggest complaint was the snap closure. When the backpack is full and worn on you kid's back, the snap pops open."
4,"My daughter loves ""Dora"", but will only say ""Backpack!""","My 17 month old daughter loves this backpack. It's plush so it's not easy to clean, but it holds her clothes, books or toys to take to her grandma's and she just loves playing with it and carrying it around. The pockets on the outside will hold things like her ultra-cool Dora sunglasses, her Dora toothbrush, or anything else I need to stick in there for her. It was a great buy for us and my daughter will use it for a long time."
4,so excited,Our daughter loves her backpack! so much more fun for her to play with than the hard plastic one that is out there. seems to be well made and she can carry her toys in it. A great find.
2,Daughter frustrated - things fall out too easily,"As a huge Dora fan my daughter loved this backpack and wanted to take it every where with all her stuff in it. Unfortunately the elastic at the sides of the bag are not tight and therefore they gape open allowing things like sippy cups, snacks and collected pebbles to fall out. All in all a little disappointing"
5,"My little Dora fan loves her ""pack-pack""","I got this backpack for my almost 3 year old daughter earlier this year when she first discovered Dora. It's been a big hit and well worth it. It's great for carrying along small books and toys for church, doctor visits, and car rides. She enjoys singing both the Backpack song and the Map song with her backpack on. She also acts out scenes from the TV show, where she is Dora and assigns the proper names of Dora's friends to other people and her stuffed animals.Overall, the plush backpack is a great item for any little one who loves Dora!"
3,NICE SHOES BUT THIN LOOKING,"These shoes are nice looking and have a very European look. Goes great with stonewashed jeans, but they have a 'thin' look to them and have a 'slipper' effect rather than a nice business casual shoe that I thought these would portray. They are okay, they are not bad, but not the true greatest in look and style. As a stylish Californian and professional business man, this shoe will pass and worth the price, but nothing more than $20-$30. I have modern urban dwelling shoes in the $150-$200 range and they have they share the same look. These will pass."
1,Did not Fit!,"I purchased this because I thought it was the product that would fit my PC. It did not at all fit my Toshiba Sattelite laptop. I do not know why it is so hard to find the proper AC Adapter for this laptop, but this one is definately not it."
1,Not well made,"this cord lasted about three weeks before the wire inside broke free of the tip. I had to rip apart the plastic housing around the tip and solder the wires directly to the barrel connector. Then, I poured an epoxy housing around the tip in order to make it look somewhat attractive again. And I also extened the cord (from the transformer to the tip) as it was WAY too short. Now it works great, but I doubt most people would want to bother with any of this."
5,Great seller,"Buying a replacement adapter for a laptop can be a bit of a challenge. I ordered the wrong one the first time, but this seller was great, shipping me a replacement immediately and allowing me to send back the one I incorrectly purchased. Would definitely deal with again."
3,Too broad a brush...,"What I would thought would bring to me some new concept or ideas to continue to move in the Lean Enterprise direction and conversion, is however a ""summary"" of all the different available tools, with nothing new about them. Unfortunately not written for those of you who have already started to implement Lean approches in Manufacturing, Supply Chain, Product Development, or else. Good for the ones looking at the different options and trying to see what can be the whole picture..."
4,A good mix of items for every experience level,"This book has a little of everything you may want to crochet: afghans, sweaters, tissue box holders, placemats, hot pads, etc. Projects range from very easy to slightly difficult. A good starter book for someone who's just learned the craft and isn't sure what patterns to try first."
5,Terrific value and look,I purchased this from Amazon after reading reviews for it in various places on the web. I found Amazon pricing to be the best and have been very pleases with my purchase. Would buy again.
5,lucky to fiind this to replace the one I lost!!!,"I had a copy of this, and lost the secocnd disc, so I was so happy to find it on Amazon so I could replace it! The discs are perfect, and the seller was great - extremely fast shipping. Thanks so much!"
3,Great Pix - Lax Content,"If you want some of the MOST beautiful pictures of macaws to ever grace an item in print, this book is for you. Some features include illustrations of extinct macaws, and a discussion of native habitat.The one complaint I have about this book is the elementary content; add to that the horribly DATED information on diet, behaviour, etc., ...Still, buy it for the photos alone!"
2,Out of Date Book,"The text is probably a direct translation from German. Has some funny expressions, rarely used in English. The information on classification of macaws is out of date. The same goes for the other information in the book. Too often some irrelevant and not so important historical notes are given, like dates of hatching in some zoos from the last century, or first pairing, etc. There is lack of consistence in dealing with the species description. The book is good for its superb photos. It is also maybe the only one to have drawings of the extinct macaw species. Otherwise, ... nay!"
1,Not at all what it advertises itself to be!,"This book claims to give tips to both sides, but I found it to be extremely one-sided with very general information! It spends a lot of time on finding a missing father and on tips for the cutodial parent (mother), but it does not have any tips for fathers that are being taken advantage of. The book is very general for those who don't have a clue about child support, but there is very little information for anyone who has been involved in the process or has even started the process."
3,Volume 2 only,"This is volume 2 only - wish the publisher would make that clear on the listing. Also, many of the photo plates are cropped strangely. Otherwise, an acceptable print of the scanned original volume."
2,Music Clan Boring Tale,"I like watching Amerian comedies of young people (too many might be INSERTED with a PRODUCT LINK here).I like watchnig American comedies of Afro-American young people (read of a PRODUCT LINK above) surely.Of course, neither everyone is W. Smith, nor in every movie world stars could play, but this produce is soooo boring that even I hardly like this music clan's either music or a plot underpinning."
1,Not the right school,"If you're going to sell the merchandise, at least get the school correct. The picture is for the University of North Carolina Tarheels (blue/white), not the N.C. State University Wolfpack (red/white). Geez.........."
2,Could have been better,"Now I find this game alright except that this game has no challenge to it. Anybody can beat easy mode and the hard mode doesn't take much. Its soundtrack makes your ears bleed (just an exaggeration). This game doesn't have enough tricks available and they can all easily be executed (like the backflip can be done even if you just do a little jump, definitely unreal even by arcade standards). Now I know that the game could have earned at least one more star. I wish that they could have put in some scooter parks and added in some vert. Keep on trying Crave Entertainment, you can make an excellent sequel, I know you can."
5,On angel wings... of purest black,"Okay, let me start by saying that I am a HUGE anime/manga fan! I LOVED the manga and I was walking around the anime section of Best Buy one day and I was like ""OMG!!!!!!!!! THEY HAVE D.N. ANGEL!!!!!"" Well, I bought the first three (that's all they had) took them home, and loved them so much I even got my mom hooked!Of course, there are things they could have done better (like follow the manga a little more) but if you really want to enjoy something you have to get over it's flaws. I mean, nothing's perfect! If you've read the manga you'll know the plot line doesn't go anywhere fast, so why should the anime? Isn't it better to be left guessing and obessing over possibilities until you finally get to see it? That's what I like but I can't speak for anyone else.Anyway, just get the first DVD and see if you like it and when you do then get the rest of the series!"
4,Risa goes for jerks,"Daisuke is a young boy who has the hots for a girl name Risa, when he gives her a love letter she gives him the cold shoulder because of that is the reason why Daisuke tranform into Dark, just like any typical girl Risa loves Dark cause of the bad boy image what a bi*ch, unlike her sister Riku she happens to fall in love with Daisuke, does he lover her well go buy this box set."
1,Typical Fangirl drek,I found DNAngel to be nauseating shoujo rubbish. I find Dark to be an obnoxious character. He's a pretty boy but I find him repugnant. This is only fangirl material not something animation fans would enjoy. I love shoujo but I recommend Snow Fairy Sugar over this rubbish. This show is rather cheesy and the romance is quite corny and sickening. It's about this loser named Daisuke who turns into Dark due to his feelings for some silly girl named Risa Harada who doesn't return his feelings. This girly is giggly silly over that heartbreaker Dark. Riku who in my opinion is the better of the Harada sisters. She is a grating character too but tolerable compared to her uber annoying sister Risa. In fact I wish Daisuke and Dark ended up dead and Risa with them. This show is repetitive and cornier than Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura combined. In short this show is a major stinker!
4,First Rate,"Along with Richard Powers' novel Galataea 2.2, this is the best American literary exploration of the human implications of artificial intelligence. This is NOT a science fiction novel. It is a very good novel, with beautifully written passages, that uses emerging biotechnology capabilities to tell a more complex and subtle story than the Philip K. Dick novel on which Blade Runner was based."
2,"Vague science in this SF, Blade Runner retread","After reading the description and reviews, I had fairly high hopes for this book. I must say I was dissapointed in that the science of the 'science fiction' was vague and the story itself left me a little bored. As I continued to read the book, which both of the 'replicants' fates were pretty predictable, I kept thinking back to the short stories of Philip K. Dick and the movie Blade Runner - both do a better job dealing with the philosophical elements and provide more stimulating plots."
1,"Paper jams and printing ""slides"" off the paper","After one month and minimal use, my HP Deskjet 5550 went haywire. It started making a horrible, loud screeching sound after printing. Next thing I knew, the printing was sliding off the side of the page when using the color cartridge (both the regular cartridge and the photo cartridge). I bought another (expensive) cartridge thinking maybe I was out of ink, and that was a waste of money. The black cartridge worked fine for a little while, but it started doing the same thing after a while. Unfortunately, I had the printer for a while before I used it, so I passed the deadline for returning it to the store I purchased it from. I've heard of two other people who've experienced the same thing. Wish I could give it a good review. The couple of times I did print pictures (at the beginning), they were beautiful. So disappointed and frustrated that it junked out!!!!"
5,"Prints great, no problems!","This printer has been working great for 3 months and I'm excited to say I haven't had a major problem. I usually only print a couple times a week, but thats enough for me. I still have full ink cartridges and the drivers work well with Windows 2000. I'll let you know if it goes hay-wire. For now, its a good product for a good price."
1,Disappointed,Presently is one year old and doesn't work. All the lights flash indicating a problem. Indicates it is out of ink which is isn't because I have installed two new black cartridges trying to get it to work. Users guide says to reboot it which doesn't help. It doesn't pick up the paper. Only God knows what is wrong with it. It appears it is cheaply make which I guess it is. I would not recommend this printer.
4,Speedy and sharp,"I was amazed at really how fast this printer actually performed under demand. I was rushed to do a big job of many photos for work, my old 820C was on its last leg. I needed something reliable and fast. I ordered the HP DJ 5550C and was able to pick it up from Office Depot within 2 hours. Once home it worked literally within 10 minutes and I was able to print the entire project on target and under budget. The color is amazing even on heavy card stock! My client asked me several times what printer I used for this job. They would not believe me when I said it was this $... HP DJ 5550. HP saved my [bacon]!"
3,"Great harware, annoying software.","Great hardware, but I didn't like the icon it runs on my taskbar's tray area. Why do I need a software running 100% of the time if I don't use the printer that much? If I exit the program, it will be back the next time I log in, and since I share the computer with another user, I log in all the time. I tried to contact HP, but the first thing they ask is the serial number of the product. Why do I need to track the serial number for such a simple question? Why don't they solve my problem before I have to solve theirs? Well, I already spent more in time with this than what the printer costed me in the first place."
1,"They forgot to include a ""Dear Schmuck"" letter....","Ok, great. I just received my new printer. It's 10 pm. A perfect time to try it out. But, what's this? NO CONNECTION CABLE INCLUDED! I can't believe out of the 50+ reviews I read about this printer, not one customer mentioned this cruical, purposefully missing part. You'd think they could at least mention it on the Amazon.com website; a simple statement ""(USB connection cable is required, but not included except for Japan customers)"". ... Guess I'll have to wait another day to try out the printer. Again, this is totally ridiculous. I'll repeat it once more for those scanning these reviews...NO USB CONNECTION CABLE INCLUDED.Steve"
5,Great Buy,"Yes the ink cartridges are small but the printer is more efficient. You will notice also that the ink is cheaper than normal. The cost per page is roughly 4-5 cents for text which is really good in inkjet printing. Reading reviews I noticed people did not feel that the pictures were any better then their previous hp's. Reason being they probably did not print them in the 4800x1200 dpi mode because it is not default. Using that resolution, decent paper and best quality the pictures look suprisingly good. I also like the self-alligning cartridge feature so you do not have to choose the best fit lines. I would recommend this printer for almost anybody. The only flaw that I found with this compared to the higher priced models is that this one only takes the tri-color and black/photo. The printer will not take all three at the same time like some of the other models. Other then that it is great."
2,Deskjet 5550 - Poor Design,"I've always been loyal to HP, and I have owned both inkjet & laser HP printers. I was happy with my last inkjet (HP DeskJet 895cxi), so I was confident in buying another HP. Unfortunately, the DeskJet 5550 was incredibly loud, and shook so hard it rocked my heavy filing cabinet. The narrow paper tray makes loading paper difficult, yet it's even larger overall than previous designs. I ended up returning it, and I'm now looking at Epson and Canon printers."
1,Basically a Piece of #%*^,"This machine jams paper routinely. When it does work, it does a decent job of printing while quickly using up its expensive cartridges. I am sorry I purchased it, and am looking for a replacement."
1,HP 5550 - a very fragile machine,"I am afraid I have to agree with the negative reviews concerning the HP 5550. I bought one about 6 weeks ago and it worked fine for the first month. After putting in a refurbished cartridge recently, it printed 1 page and then stopped halfway through the second page, telling me to ""check the line"". The ""line"" was working fine, but there was no real explanation given, either on-line or in the user manual, for it to stop right in the middle of printing the document. Also, the machine is very fragile to handle. Lifting up the lid to check on or replace an ink cartridge makes a sound that makes one think the machine has been broken beyond repair, and I am afraid that that is what has happened to this one."
1,I hate you hewlett packard,"I got this about 6 months ago? Because my dad had gotten one like it.. it printed alot faster than the sucky lexmark that my mom had, but it was only printing in black and white so they took it back. I thought maybe it was just the one that would was messed up. I WAS SO WRONG.This one prints in color. That doesnt make up for the constant messages OUT OF PAPER right after I put the paper in. paper jams. mechanical errors.The lexmark was slow.. and the quality of printings wasnt that great, but there were never this many paper jams."
1,Regional coding,"I cannot recommend HP to anybody anymore. The company introduced regional coding, which means printer cartridges from one region cannot be used in another. For most this is probably not an issue, for those busily traveling around it is. Also, it is an issue of principle, its bad enough for DVD, but printer cartridges? HP has introduced this rather secretely and if you don't read the box cover etc very carefully, you may not notice. The main issue is in Europe. I got caught out. I bought a 3 catridges overseas - I could not use them on my HP printer. I asked for a refund, HP Email Support (US) was nice but ineffective. HP Customer Support (Europe) was snotty and very rude. I think HP does not care about its customers and this cost me over US$75, almost 50% of my printer (my sixth and last HP). Don't buy HP."
5,Space age product,"I stumbled across this product while searching for a printer for my grand-daughter for college. It is fast, (necessary for a teenager), prints near perfect pictures in double color cartridge mode, and double-sided printing can be added. On top of all that, it is really stylish. It looks like something from the Starship Enterprise. The price is reasonable, and the price for ink cartridges is pretty high like those for all excellent printers."
3,Has AC Adapter,The printer performs well with good quality photo prints. And it is fast when using draft mode. But beware that the ink carts are expensive (I couldn't find other vendor compatible carts). And the thing that I dislike the most is the huge AC adapter. It's 4 1/2 inches long and takes up a lot of space on a power strip. Had I known about the AC adapter I would not have bought this printer. That's why I give it only three stars.
4,Great printer.,"Printer installed perfectly on my Win7 machine. However, my XP machines did not recognize it and I had a lot of trouble getting the drivers to work. It is adequate for my needs."
2,Waste of money,"Good looking printer. After warranty expired it's the only one positive thing I can tell about it. It doesn't work properly, prints have no straight vertical lines, some strange noises are coming from it, no way of printing photos. It visited service twice. I had a DJ690c in the past and after 5 years of use the only thing to replace was one small thing in paper feeder. DJ5550 is a piece of junk."
3,Ok printer,"This printer is ok... It prints usually pretty good, and the cartirges last a long time if you know what you are doing, and don't use the printer all the time. The bad part of this printer is that it jams at the slightest imperfection in the paper. I just had it ruin two sheets of photo paper because the corner was a little bent. I even made sure it fed the non bent corner first, and it still jamed after printing just a little bit. I would reconmend this to anyone who needs a simple printer that won't let you down. Just make sure your paper is perfect."
4,Pretty solid printer; shame about the cartidges though.,"I've had this printer for the best part of 2 years now. It's only ever jammed on me once, and that's when I tried to put too much paper into the feeder. The only real gripe I have about this printer is the way it eats cartridges like there's no tomorrow. Cartridge prices have recently come down though, but they're still incredibly high for what's supposed to be a medium-scale printer. I usually use my brother's LaserJet upstairs if I need to print something quickly."
4,Great!,I've had this printer for a lot of time. It's really cool and really econimal because no matter the cartriges are almost empty it will print like if the cartriges were new.
2,Died after warranty expired,"I previously had a 722c HP Printer that worked like a miracle. It lasted forever. Actually it still works, but it just got too slow so I bought the 5550. It worked great initially, but just shortly after 1 year, it went nuts. All its lights would flash and nothing was working properly. So now its just sitting there in my room. Its pretty disappointing since I expected all HPs to be of the same quality as the 722c. Too bad."
2,Died after warranty expired,Printed great for a little over a year (the duration of the warranty) and then it quit and just flashed all it's lights at us. We're told by a printer repair tech that the logic board is dead.
2,Just OK with a Mac,It works with OSX but at times can be a real pain to use.....also a very fragile unit that really goes through ink.
2,"A few good songs, but not one of his best","This album was a comeback album for Gregg in 1987, after 5 years of playing clubs & bars. It features former Allman Brothers guitarist Dan Toler, who never had the gritty, bluesy chops of Dickey Betts, Warren Haynes, Duane Allman or current ABB slide prodigy Derek Trucks. The title track was a top40 hit & still gets plenty of airplay on album rock stations 12 years later. The album is just overproduced.I would recommend passing on this one & picking up something from the Allman Brothers Band in the 1990s (An Evening With.. or Seven Turns) to hear what real blues-rock sounds like. For a taste of Gregg's solo career, Searchin for Simplicity (1997) may be his best solo effort of this career. It is a much more honest, roots oriented rhythm and blues album without the extra studio production that hinders I'm No Angel."
4,Stay Out Of Court,"Slam the Door on Employee Lawsuits tells how to keep your business out of court. It advises business owners and managers on avoiding wrongful discharge, handling hostile employees, wage and hour issues, employee privacy and other touchy work topics.These situations can burden employers with huge financial setbacks. Be prepared, have your policies in place and know what is proper and legal.(I deducted one star since the book needs to be reissued to include any changes of the last few years)"
5,The best deal out there,My parents own a small eureka and have been unable to find replacement bags at any store. I found these on amazon and apparently the only way you can get them is online. Amazon had the best price and they were delivered fast. The bags are a little longer than the one's that came with the eureka but I'm guessing that's because they wanted the consumer to have to buy replacements sooner. Otherwise the bag fits and work just fine.
1,Vacuum Bags,"I decided to purchase 2 packages just to save time & have extra. They arrived GENERIC, no markings, not even install instructions & without any vacuum packaging at all. I had already taken my old vacuum bag out & thrown it away so without the install instructions, I thought I was doing it wrong when it wouldn't easily install...it turns out the bags just don't fit right. Now I'm stuck w/6 bags that are not worth sending back & have to go out & buy Eureka real (non-generic) bags that will actually fit! VERY disappointing :("
4,Genuine Eureka Premium Style L Vacuum Bag 61715A - 3 bags,I haven't yet used any of the bags - I'm waiting for the one currently in the vacuum to need replacing. I was very glad to find this difficult size!
2,so so purchase,lots of religious references in the text. the pictures were fairly satisfying. was not the greatest gift i've ever given someone.
1,They Should Have Labeled It Something Else,"As I point out in my review of Volume 1, the only thing this release does is correct a listing mistake in Volume 1 which had shown Dream as track 14. It wasn't, and some people were rightfully upset.But that is the ONLY hit in this disappointing Volume 2, as once again they overlooked three legitimate charters and, repeating a major oversight from Volume 1, again did not include one of the B-sides to her remaining nine hits (both sides of Little White Lies and 1492 are in Volume 1).Pretty shabby way of dealing with two volumes titled ""Betty's Hits."""
4,Pass the gumbo,"Live Rads is never a bad thing, Nice set from some real pros.Have no fear this is solid."
4,"Surrender, where have you gone?","This is a highlight package of Surrender Cinema's best girl-on-girl scenes. It includes probably the hottest non-hardcore lesbian scene you'll ever see, between Jacqueline Lovell (aka Sara St James) and Vanessa Taylor. These are ""B-movie"" scenes where you get the occasional flash of pink. I don't think Surrender Cinema is making movies anymore, but they were a groundbreaker in erotic movie making."
4,"Pretty hot, but not the best","The previous review was fairly accurate, but I was a bit disappointed with this one. Not nearly as explicit as ""Casting Couch"" another recent Surrender release. Not much here that you can't see on cinemax. Also, Lovell really doesn't do it for me, and you won't see any of the familiar B-movie girls in this; mostly newcomers, some of whom are B+.Not bad for a rainy night, but I doubt I will watch it again."
3,good read for Mother and daughter,"My daughter and I decided to read this book at the same time so we could talk about it as we went. Initially I was not that in to it, but by chapter 4, I was equally as engrossed as she. The many dynamics that are looked at, boyfriend/girlfriend, best friends, mother/daughter, etc. were all well related and showed good development. The book speaks of love, loyalty, and truth in a way that both of us found interesting and kept us reading."
4,A great book,"This book is about friendship, love and family.The summer for Halley is hard, her best friend Scarlett discovers that she is carring her past away boyfriend's baby.And for the first time, Scarlett really needs Halley's help, when Halley is having problems herself. Her boyfriend who just can't seem to understand her, her parents who don't listen, and her grandmother dying. This is a great book, because I think a lot of teenagers can really relate to this book."
4,it was good,i really liked this book it was a great story about two girls and there teenage problems that happen.
1,Wasn't too impressed,I wasn't happy when I started reading this book becuase I figured out that this book is the same as the movie How to Deal with Mandy Moore in it. Character names and all. I thought that this book was a waste of money.
2,Someone Like You,This book weighs about a half pound. The cover had a cool pastel drawing. I never read this book.
2,Someone Like You,"Well i suppose it was an ok read, but just ok. I was really expecting more. This was my best friends favorite book so when she gave it to me for christmas, i wanted to read it. I was sadly dissapointed! Im sorry, but cigarette smoking bad boys who get drunk and go to parties arent the type of guys i'd be swooning over. I guess if i havent read so many beter romance/teen books, i'd say this was pretty good, but it didnt even really end well either. Her and the guy never even really talked at the end. I guess my big mistake was reading Twilight before reading this book. If you want a real romance book thats PG, and so amazing you feel it in your heart, i would highly recomend Twilight! That is the book i got my best friend hooked on! When i asked her which she prefered~ there was no competition. Twilight won."
5,This is an AMAZING book.,"I am a 15 year old teen and this is one of the best portrayals of a ""normal"" teenager story. The relationship between the mothers and daughters is realistic. This novel contains the normal people that someone would encounter; the rebel, the dreamer; and not to mention the gossip. I would recomend this book to either daughter or mother."
2,Dissapointing,"The beginning of the book was awesome!!!It had me up until like 3:00 a.m. reading!!But then at the end, when Halley didn't take Macon back, it deeply dissapointed me. I didnt finish the end of the book because it seemed boring without them together."
4,Someone Like You,"This is a really truly great book from my favorite author, Sarah Dessen. Her stories may not be picturesque, but they are so real you momentarilary belive you are part of the story and that it is actually happening to you. Most young adult book authors write stories that are so annoyingly fake- you do not believe their stories for a minute, their books belong in the fantasy catagory. but Sarah's books such as, Someone Like You, are so believable that you can relate to the characters and their lives in many ways."
1,Someone Like You,"In Someone Like You, I have already read about the hardships of teenage pregnancy and the mournings over a dead friend. Although I am only on the seventy-fifth page and I already have an idea as to what the message is. This book is really great for teenagers that are going through tough times. I strongly recommend this book to anyone with an open heart and mind."
1,even more tepid than the movie,"I picked this up on vacation as my cousin was reading it, hoping to find a new YA author. Apparently, this was made into a movie called ""How to Deal"" with Mandy Moore, a movie I turned off about fifteen minutes into it. I hoped the book would be better. I was wrong.The plot was cookie cutter. The writing was tepid with nothing distinctive about it. The characters were annoying and unsympathetic. Even worse, I started wishing for even more bad things to happen to them. I put it down about fifty pages into it.Yes, I'm an adult, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying well written YA novels. The key is ""well written."" It takes a colossally bad book to get me to ditch it halfway through, and this one was that."
4,Fate and Friendships,"This book deals with things that regular teenagers go through. It's ""real"" and let's people who aren't teenagers know what it's like to be a teenager. The characters in the book are going through things that life brings and the book shows how they deal with them. It is a good example of how to deal with things and it is realistic. It is well written and people would be able to relate to it since it deals with unusual and hard situations.Overall, it is a good book and I wouldn't mind reading another book by Sarah Dessen. I would recommend it to someone who would like to read something realistic and interestingley addicting, then read this book and find out the things that these two teenagers go through in life."
3,good read for older teens,"Well this book was a little different than I thought it would be. It is more of a story of best friends and growing and learning. Not one of my favorite Dessen books. But I really like this authors portrayal of teens and high school life. It is very realistic and true without being crude or too descriptive. This book deals with drugs, teen pregnancy, underage drinking and teen sex. The author writes in a way that it is ok for older teens to read not too descriptive and they might actually come away from these books a little smarter."
4,YA Recommended,Really enjoyed this journey of self discovery of Halley and her friend Scarlett. One of the best books I've read so far.YA Recommended
4,Best Friends and First Loves,"Someone Like You was a very good book. It was about best friends, Scarlett and Halley, getting through high school and all the problems that they came upon. Scarlett got pregnant by boyfriend Michael. Halley and Scarlett went to classes to learn about babies and how to be a good mom. Halley was there for Scarlett the whole way through. Halley meet Macon and he was a little wild and Halley liked that because her mom didn't like it, but Halley realizes that who she needs the most is Scarlett, her baby, and her family. This book was a very good bokk and I think anyone my age would like it."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I picked up this book after reading another book of Dessen's. A few pages into the book, I realized that this book was what the movie, How To Deal with Mandy Moore, was all about. I decided to keep reading, hoping that it would be a little different- not so much. I would recommend this book, but I prefer How To Deal better."
4,Someone Like You,"This book is incredible! I couldn't put it down. It was a bit depressing, but at the same time it talked about something that happens often, a girl in high school gets pregnant. When I read the first few pages about Michael, her boyfriend, dying, that was really sad and I cried. Therefore, it was well written to make me cry. I went through many emotions while reading this book."
5,True definition of friendship,"We all depend on someone. What does it mean to have a true friend? Are they just...there? In ""Someone Like You"" Scarlett is discovered to be pregnant with her dead boyfriend's baby. She needs Halley, her best friend, more than ever, but Halley is having trouble since she was always the one who needed help, not the one who provided it. But if it's Scarlett, she will do anything. ""Someone Like You"" teaches the true value of friendship and what it means to be a true friend to someone."
3,"Good, but not my favourite","It was good. The third book I've read of her's in three days, but I like Just Listen and The Truth About Forever better."
4,How to Deal,"I've read the first story of How to Deal, which is ""Someone Like YOU"". I didn't really get that Halley went to the ""wild side"" until I read one of these other reviews. But Halley is a good, sometimes funny narrator who tells about her friend Scarlett's problems, helps her through them, and also her own first relationship with Macon. She sticks by Scarlett no matter what, just like she had always done, because that's what friends are for, and the ending, of course, makes you feel happy and warm inside. I can't wait to watch the movie."
4,Someone Like You,"This book was soooo good- one of the best novels i've read in a while. this book is about two best friends, Halley and Scarlett, who stay together thru thick and thin. One day, Scarlett's boyfriend dies, and a couple months later, she finds out she's pregnant with his baby! Later on Halley starts going out with troublemaker Macon Faulkner. He pressures her into sleeping with him... what will happen next???????THIS IS AN AWESOME BOOK, every teen should read it. :)"
5,A wonderful book and a wonderful reveiew,"This book is about Halley and scarlett, the best of friends. but when Scarllett's boyfriend gets killed in a crash scarlett in is need of her BEST friend. BUt when Scarlett finds out that she in carrying his baby things start to happen. Halley starts to spend more and more time with scarlett's dead boyfriend.Read thins book and you will not beable to put it down.My friend and i both agree this is one of the best books eather of us have read.In other words........READ THIS BOOK!"
5,This is a wonderful story about a wonderful friendship.,"Sarah Dessen has done a WONDERFUL job on this book. It is an excellent story about two friends(Haley and Scarlette)And their friendship during high school. The story is beautifuly written,and the characters seem so real. Sarah makes you feel like you are actually experiancing the events from Haley's new boyfriend to Scralette's baby. I have to praise Sarah Dessen for a Outstanding job on SOMEONE LIKE YOU. This is definatly one of my favorites!"
5,You'll Never Be The Same Again,"If there's a musician in possesson of greater genius than this one, I have yet to hear them. The work of pfly invariably leaves a unique and indelible influence on its listener -- if you're into that sort of thing, this is the CD you want."
2,this book,"this book is alright but the thing that i hated was that it says ""go to snap settings"" and it took me over 20 minutes to find it. It doesn't tell you where to find stuff. It took me over 2 hours to do some projects because i was exploring to find settings and boxes i had to check. dont buy it."
1,Not very user friendly,"Being a new Max user, I found that this book confused me...the instructions it gave were quite vague and sometimes did not work. It leaves out areas of importance which you should know when you create the scenes in the book."
1,On the Road Again with Man's Best Friend,"This book was a complete waste of money! Last summer our family drove from Rhode Island to Washington State with our cat and two Golden Retrievers. NOT A SINGLE ESTABLISHMENT I CONTACTED FROM THIS BOOK TOOK PETS! Some of the motels I called told me that they have NEVER taken animals. Save your money and use AAA's Traveling With Your Pet. It's cheaper, and one heck of a lot more reliable."
3,A reader who has travelled across US,This guide would have been very helpful if i had a small dog - most of the places listed in this book only take small dogs. The guide would have been more useful it was specific about the size of dog allowed (big or small). Also found places that stated they would take dogs had changed policies so keeping the guide up to date would be a must.
5,Essential for traveling with pets.,"If you recently adopted a pet, this book is essential if you plan to travel with your pet. All of the hotel, airline, trains, campground regulations are discussed. The documentation and supplies needed are indicated. As well as, a discussion, on a personal level, of the possible hazards and pitfalls associated with pet travel."
2,ONLY FOR DIE HARD FANS,"Definitely, this is not the best record of nkotb. There is only 2 or 3 good songs, and the rest of the album is a waste of time. Only if you are a hard fan of nkotb you will enjoy this album. If you want to listen their best music, buy ""hanging tough"" or ""greatest hits""."
2,Not their best,"I got to hear this album during the helm of their Hangin' Tough success. It sounds like music for the Disney channel. Only Donnie Wahlberg stands out vocally on this album. Joey McIntyre has that high voice and Jordan Knight had a strong falsetto on Didn't I Blow Your Mind. I can tell now that Hangin' Tough, their Christmas album, Step By Step and Face The Music are their more stellar and better albums. I wanted to avoid this album, but I can see now. I thought that Hangin' Tough was their first, but I didn't know about this one. This first one wasn't their best."
3,Almost Dream Street-y... ALMOST...,"People keep telling me I'd love NKOTB since they ""sound like the 80s version of Dream Street!"" so I came here and listened to a clip... uh... well, I guess they are both groups of young boys, but DS has better, more mature sound and the boys have niceer voices. I prefer DS, but for wacked out 80s-ness... it's better than other 1980s music!!"
1,I dare you to try to make worse,"Back in '92 (When they still had a career) my buddy picked this up from the closeout bin for a dollar.As fans of Germs and Stooges, we were ready for an ironic treat of epic proportions.It all backfired horribly.I am not exaggerating or trying to be funny; this thing literally made me sick to my stomach.My friend was laughing as I begged him to ""please shut it off,"" but I swear, had it gone on a second longer, I would have actually vomited.I could rattle off a list of superlatives like, ""3d Place in a Jr. High School Talent Show""...""Makes Vanilla Ice look like Chuck D...."" or ""The Street Cred of the Peanuts Gang""...But I would simply dare you to pick it up.I lack the vocabulary to describe just how exquisitely awful this release is.They...try to rap...""Try...""My mom made more legitimate raps in our kitchen with the topic of popcorn in hand.I triple dog dare you to buy this."
3,"Not brilliant writing, but it's fun","I've been a NK fan since I was 16 years old. No, their music wasn't brilliant, but it was geared towards a young crowd, and most of the guys were pretty young, as well. The first album was pretty corny, but it's so much fun to listen to and laugh at the lyrics!! I still pop my cd in once and awhile and reminice. Jordan's voice rings clear as a bell on ""Didn't I (Blow Your Mind This Time)"", showing his talent. Even though its corny as hell, its a lot of fun to listen to. If you are a fan, this is a must have!!"
1,Poor quality/service/expensive price,"My daughter wanted this CD, so despite the expensive price, I ordered it for her, along with two others by TNKOTB. They arrived today in a box that was not damaged at all. This particular CD's case is cracked in more ways than one, and it's obvious that it was packaged this way. Amazon's replacement policy on this item is ""there is none."" So beware of buying when sold by someone else and ""fulfilled by Amazon."" I would have to inconvenience myself to go to a store, buy a mailer, take it to the PO to get weighed, pay to insure it and mail it, etc., and then wait on them to receive this package and credit my card (within 2 weeks). This is NOT acceptable to me, so the only other option is a 35% credit to my card. Despite the credit, I still paid way too much for this CD with an extremely damaged case. However, the other two CDs ""sold and fulfilled by Amazon"" are pristine. Buyer beware!!!"
4,How cute!,"I was IN LOVE with this band in elementary school!! Joey's voice is so good in this album. So I was and still am biased to the songs with his solo (ie ""Treat me Right,"" ""Popsicle,"" etc)."
1,MIGHT AS WELL HAD MONKEYS SINGING ON STAGE,THIS CD IS ALMOST AS GAY AS THEY ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT KNEW HOW TO SING REMOTELY WAS JOE AND HE WAS 12 AND HAS NOT GONE THOUGH PUBERITY YET IF YOU WOULD LIKE YOU GET ANGRY WITH ME FIRST OFF ITS NOT MY PROBLEM THEY SINK AND 2ND HERES MY EMAILL ADDRESS Robin_Charles_Young@hotmail.com
1,Take notice of the reviews!!,"As a long time Lizzy fan, this is about as bad a DVD as it gets. Thank God for the music snipets. Very little is learned and who are these people challenged with giving their opinions???.Avoid at all costs"
1,Total agreement with other reviews - don't waste your money,"Imagine paying full CD price for something that could have shown up on a discussion board, or ""blog"".Yes, you get a few snippets of performances and Phil Lynott speaking, but is that worth paying full price for a CD?At a minimum, this should have been priced as an interview CD that sells for half the price of a regular CD.I have seen ads for these ""Inside [name of band]"" CDs. They are very deceptive, thus a great big thank you for the reviewers below for pointing this deception out.By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves, thus the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"
1,Amazing!,Amazing how someone that has a good general knowlege of the Bible could convert to the Catholic faith.Buy and Read the Bible!
3,Dishrack system,"The size and style are nice and it looks much more attractive on the counter versus the plastic rack that I used to have. The tray that comes with the dishrack has a defect - the raised edge on the left hand side is not formed correctly for a 2 inch section. I decided not to send everything back for a new unit since it sits on a back corner of my counter. Quality really should have picked the defect up though. The other problem is that the holder for utensils only fits well on the outside of the rack. There are holes in the bottom of the holder for water to drain which means that the water drains on the counter and not into the rack. To avoid this, I put the rack on the inside if I don't have many dishes to wash. If I have a sinkful of dishes, I just don't use the utensil holder. I haven't used the glass cleaners yet."
3,Polder Stainless Dish Rack,"The dish rack itself was in excellent condition, along with the included accessories. However, the draining tray was broken when I received it. Shop At Clares customer service was very understanding and did give a refund."
5,"Unless you require digital input, this is the BEST 15"" panel","Unless you require digital input interface,which I would recommend Eizo Nanao's L365, NEC's 1550M is by far the best in terms of image quality for the price. Contrasts and brightness make this monitor stand out from the crowd. I found my Samsung panel at work lacks the brightness and contrasts that i demand, but this 1550M meets my highest expectation. The small premium over the others including NEC 1550V is worth every bit.By the way, the 1550M's panel is identical to Nanao's L365, which explains why these two monitors manage to have such outstanding image quality. (Still a satisfed user even though my panel has one dead pixel)"
3,it's okay....really but not worth the price,It was good but you'll have to buy a keyboard with it since it covers the keyboard part of the notebook. It's not as sturdy as it looks and takes up a lot of space LOVE THE PORT THOUGH :)
4,FilterFast shipped an older model,"I ordered GE Replacement Water Filter Set as indicated on Amazon's product description as FXSVC Rev. 2, but the item shiped was an older model (Rev. 1) with a different looking tube. There is one green and one brown tube in the set. The brown-color filter tube looks very different between the older model and the Rev. 2. The Rev. 2's brown-color tube has solid plastic housing while the Rev. 1's tube that FilterFast shipped has white filter fabric outside. I understand that the brown-color tube contains charcoal filter to improve water taste. The older model allows water to flow through the surrounding surface of the charcoal tube while the Rev. 2 pushes water through the entire length of the tube, so I am assuming that Rev. 2's method is more effective as water get pushed through more charcoal contents. Other than that the product looks and works all right."
5,Saves a heap of cash ordering these.,I have been ordering these filters for a number of years for my under sink filter system. These replacements are a great alternative to the high priced name brand.
1,quality appears to be much lower,"I've been using these filters for years. Recently I noticed when I bought a replacement set, that they were made in Mexico. When I used a TDS meter to test the water, it went from 220 ppm (tap water) to about 187 ppm (filtered). I remembered getting much better results when testing the filtered water before. I believe that there is inadequate carbon inside the carbon filter to reduce total dissolved solids (chlorine, lead, mercury, etc.) One thing that is very evident is the redesign of the carbon filter -- it was a solid grey tube before -- now it looks just like the companion filter. Now I have to tear out my GE smartwater filter and install something new."
3,I haven't done a comparison but...,"The water tastes ok. It takes longer to fill a glass than the kitchen faucet so I cheat sometimes. Makes very good tasting tea and coffee. Why, I wonder, do they tell you to let it run 10 seconds before drinking it?"
2,"Filters water, mostly","I purchased this product to install into a pre-existing filter system; while I can tell the difference tap water and water through this filter, it's not the same as modern filter systems. Bottom line, it works, just not great."
2,It is OK but not exactly I expected,It is OK but not exactly I expected. It is an older version of the filter.
2,a weak book about a great musician,"This reads like an academic's thesis which got published without ever being edited for publication. Conversational on one page, professorially pedantic on the next, straining throughout in its effort to contextualize all of Coltrane's work in the writings of Fela Sowande; this is not an especially fun or insightful read. The book's lack of focus extends to even the placement of photographs, which appear throughout the book with no relationship to the choronology of the text. The best passages are Cole's personal recollections of Coltrane, in particular his recount of Coltrane practicing with a friend in a hotel room. For those sections alone, the book is worthwhile for dedicated Coltrane fans. But newcomers to Coltrane about would do far better to pick up Eric Nisenson's ""Ascension: John Coltrane and His Quest."""
2,Couldn't Get Very Far With This One,"I'll admit that I didn't get past page 40 of this book. The constant quoting of Fela Sowande made it seem like a religious tract with Sowande as the guru. The attempts to link jazz to African culture, while admirable, are often strained and ham-fisted. When Cole analyzes Coltrane's music, it appears that he really knows his stuff, but it's so technical he lost me. And the biographical portions of the book don't have very good narrative flow, tend to be repetitive, and aren't very well written.It's clear that Cole is a first-rate musicologist but he's out of his depth with the attempt at cultural history and his intro to Coltrane's life and music isn't very user-friendly. I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
2,Hero-worshipper or Academic?,"I agree with other reviewers, that the author tries to be both a hero-worshipping spectator and a musical academician. The two do not always meet, and rarely reinforce each other. Given that his main subject was Miles Davis, it seems that his interest in Coltrane developed more as an ancillary ""pop"" infatuation, from just being in the jazz environment, than an academic interest.While I enjoyed the author's recounting of his many encounters with the jazz musicians of the 1950s and 60s, not a lot of light was shed on Trane's music beyond the attempt to make a rather superficial connection with its Nigerian roots. This is rather curious in itself since the author admitted not really understanding Trane's later more spiritual music.Given these concerns and the fact that the manuscript was rather sloppy written -- especially for a Phd student -- there is not much to recommend about this book. Two stars"
5,Works as it should,"I manage an IT department and have used these units on multiple occasions. Never had an issue, always worked, always have a few on hand. A note to all, for every drop you want to split you need two of these units, one at the jack and one at the panel and preferably traced and labeled so each device connected, ie; pc, voip phone, etc., uses the same pairs from one end to the other."
1,Read ME! Rated one star for your attention!!!,Read ME! Rated one star for your attention!!! You can't use this product to split the Internet line to connect two separate devices. What you are looking for is a Router or a Switch. Internet signal is a digital signal with a designated IP (Internet Protocol) address. Each Network device has to have a unique IP address and a DHCP server to releases that IP address. This device only splits the signal. It dose not assign IP addresses or act as a DHCP server. Even in the product description it says that you CAN NOT use it to split a port on a modem.
1,Research plenty before you purchase,The switch did not work properly. I was going to send it back but after much thought I decided to just bite the bullet. The cost to return it would have been not worth the price and agravation this piece of crap put me through. Take my advice by a real network switch from any reatailer. The one I got at Walmart cost me the same as this crap and it works fine plus it gave me four other ports.
3,not,Did not work for my application. I did not fully understand what I needed. I am sure this would work in the correct application.
1,1/2 no work ??,This is an internet splitter that looks fancy & well built BUTTTTT it does not work. It only works on 1/2 the output so the other output is not functioning. This was no help in doing what I need to do. Dont know if I should reorder or try a different maker.
1,Ethernet splitter,This product does NOT work in splitting your Ethernet cables. Only 1 side of the splitter will actually work. Not recommend at all.
1,Major Disappointment,Bought this product...reasonable cost...no brainer type product....never worked. Not worth returning given the cost of sending back and low price paid. I'm no idiot...know how to plug it in...must've done it 50 times in disbelief that it doesn't work...it doesn't. First major disappointment form Amazon long purchase experience.
5,Great product,Unlike the other user. I think these pills are of good quality. I often take a couple out of the container and pack them with my lunch or for work and have not had a problem with them turning into powder.Great price and good quality.
2,L ARGININE,"See no difference after taking for a month. May work for others, but I can't see any difference in my energy level or any other improvements."
1,I went to the emergency because of this product,"Usually I don't write negative reviews and you can check my other comments, but I had to say something here.I never had a problem swallowing pills, but this one is different. It is huge with sharp edges, it literally scratched my esophagus and I had to go to the hospital as I was bleeding from the mouth, I even think about suing them.Please stay away and get either GNC or vitaminshop capsules"
1,Walmart brand worked much beter,Waste of money. NOW is usually ok stuff but this was overdosed and the stuff at wally world kicks its ass.
1,Pills open up,"If you put the pills in a pill reminder, you will find their coating splits apart and a power mess all over your pill caddy."
4,arginine,"good product, only problem was it's hard to break the tabs in half if i don't want a whole one or if i want 1 and a half..."
3,L-Arginine,I was a bit disappointed that the tablets split open and spilled out. I don't know if the product works because most of the tablets split.
1,EXPLOSION!,"Be careful---they explode and then you can't use them. I really like NOW brand, but this product is no good."
1,Horse pill,"Thought I was going to die after taking this pill. I'm not small and yet this pill lodged in my throat and it was a scary, long three or four minutes until I was able to throw it up. Hate to toss the whole bottle but man that was scary."
3,Monster Sized,"Maybe it's just me but these things are huge! I haven't had any of the ""exploding pill"" issues that others have mentioned and do keep them in the original bottle; cap on tightly.I will be looking for a smaller pill size when it's time to replenish my supply."
2,Not sure what the benefit is,Have been taking this for a few weeks now. I don't feel any different so don't know what benefit I am getting from it. At this point I would say no benefit. Before I purchased it I read about the pills being too large to swallow and a problem with exploding pills. I have not had any of these problems. I left the seal on under the cover and also left the moisture pack inside with the pills.
1,NOW L-Arginine Tablets blow up!,Some of these tablets blow up for me as well. When i tried to use the the blown up loose tablets...severely burned my tongue...like battery acid ! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013OVX3U/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img
5,Good product,"Pills came packaged well. Im reading alot of people saying the pills exploded.. Not mine. It had an air tight seal around the bottle, the ones you have to pill off in order to open the bottle. Not one pill was bad. Most importantly the pills work. Day 1 i found that i had MUCH more energy. and thats just taking 1 gram. not to mention the other :) benefits that come with it :). no complaining from me."
1,Do Not Buy Can Cause Harm,"The tablets, stored in the original container with the moisture absorbent packs, ""exploded"", bursting the thin shell containing the powder. I used what I thought was an intact capsule that leaked powder on my tongue severely ""burning"" it.I contacted customer service. They knew of the problem and acted as if the ""exploding tablets"" were my fault, telling me to dispose of the tablets. Great advice! They also got rid of me as a customer forever.The company knows the product is defective and can cause harm. I am amazed that they have not issued a recall.The only reason I rated this product a one is because the system does not provide for negative numbers."
2,Horse Pills!,The pill is huge and anyone having problems swallowing pills won't like these. You can get the same brand at half the strength but 2x the number of capsules for the same price. I would recommend the smaller capsules.
2,too big,"way to big, hav to cut in half, not very good taste, i like because they are 1000mg, but really haven't noticed any difference, been taking for 5 months"
3,//,makes you sleepy as hell. didn't really notice any other difference other than that. still taking it but at night.
5,THE #1 BEST BOOK ON RICKY,"I have read everything there is to read about Ricky and I found this book the most interesting, inspiring, fun and cool. Get this one!"
3,Good but could be better.,"This book is good and there are few, if any, other products that cover this topic in this depth. Still, as an amateur naturalist, I ran across a species that did not appear in the book and I'm only a amateur. It is surprisingly hard to id some species even with the book in hand. Still, I'm glad I bought it and also for this second cc which was a gift for a biologist friend whom I often accompany afield."
5,Street Wires is quality.,Real solid. Nicely built product and looks great too. I purchased this for my stereo system's power supply and I also bought a Street Wire ground block. It's just as good too. Properly wiring a system is almost as important as which componants you use to make that system up.
3,Not as impressive a collection as I'd expected.,"Like some scores, this is not one you simply push play and leave on on the background... I was hoping for some spectacular, often subtle, orchestral reinterpretations of Christmas pieces; but, ended up favoring one or two tracks, leaving the rest to take up hard drive space."
5,A lovely accompaniment to movie,What a lovely way to enjoy the beautiful music from the movie in my car. Truly a classic and must have for your Christmas collection!
2,It's Okay. But there are better books out there.,This book is an alright basic guide to food plots. The botanist in me is terrified at the chapter titled: Alfalfa and other perennial grasses. This is because alfalfa is a legume not a grass. This and many other technical details cause the rating of this book to drop.This book also outlines many commercial food plot blends. While this is great I'd love to see an updated version of this list and of the book.I have read Quality Food Plots by QDMA and that is a book worth reading and rereading.
4,Hard to find in local stores,i bought this as a gift for my Mother. She had used the old one for years and could not find a replacement. She was thrilled to get another one.
1,can i give less than one star?,"finishing this short book was about as enjoyable as having teeth pulled. what a chore to wade through this very unfunny thing. if you read this and wonder why you don't get the humor in it; don't worry, there is nothing to get. it is void of humor. what we have here is something for the pretensious who want to think that they are hip. the author of this cartoon is trying sooooooooo hard to be hip that it becomes painful. yuck!"
5,We all need this!,Everyone needs to read this book. Get to know the Lord. It's a small book but wow!
2,YELLOWISH,"THIS LOTION DID NOT SMELL LIKE THE PERFUME, IF ANYTHING I AM CONCERNED IT 'EXPIRED' OR WAS A BAD BATCH. IT SMELLS WEIRD AND LOOKS WEIRD I HAVE NEVER HAD A PALE YELLOW LOTION BEFORE. NOT TO MENTION WHEN IT GOT IT IN THE MAIL DESPITE GREAT PACKAGING, THE TOP WAS BENT LIKE IT HAD BEEN LEVELING A TABLE..."
5,Great Band,"This is an awesome band!!! Probably the best version of Hungry I have ever heard.. Grat guitars, great voice... kinda defaultish but not really if you catch my drift... Give em a shot, you wont be dissapointed!!"
2,Not so hot,"Was really excited about getting this. My daughter was so excited to recieve it, but once set up the pole is too whimpy. Next time I would invest in a hardware pole and just buy a ball. The set came in a case, but the case was cut open on the bottom. I never contacted company because there is really no need for the case. I also ordered this set because the picture showed a pink ball when i first looked it up. When I went to order it there was no picture.recieved a whimpy yellow ball. Guess that was my fault, should have asked questions. Anyway you get what you pay for. It was a good price,but not a really strong produce."
1,not sturdy enough for a large crowd,The tetherball set was inexpensive but not sturdy enough for a large crowd of children. It broke the first day I put it up. I would buy a more sturdy one next time.
4,fun,got this for grand kids and they love it and so dose my wife and I good buy and it is still going
1,poor quality,"Had to return the first tetherball set up because the ball had a hole, the second set the ball lasted one day before deflating due to a broken ring where it ties to the rope....my 7 year old was the only one playing with it and he can not be very rough, so whats the deal?? never again...!!!!"
1,"Cheap price, cheap quality","Cheapest tether ball set you'll find... both in price and quality. Pole is thinner than most and very flimsy. Would need to be cemented for any sort of support. Really only suitable for younger tether ballers who can't whack the ball too hard. To top it off, my set came without the ball, rope and pump! Would not buy again."
3,"Image Quality is good, toner for this very expensive","I like the image quality that this printer puts out. It doesn't take to long for a job to print out. I had trouble printing on some laser photo paper, I don't know if I had a setting wrong or not but it was like part of the image wouldn't stick to the paper. A big issue I have with this phaser is the prices of the toner cartridges. Paying to replace all the toner cartridges will break your bank. The high capacity go for around $200 per color. The normal capacity go for about $100. I have the normal capacity in mine and it seems to go pretty quick. Make sure when you are doing your research on a laser color printer check and see how much it will cost you for toner."
3,"Purchase price good, overall cost of maintenance bad","The color prints come out fine; the printer has very little memory, so you'll have to wait for a while. Toner is expensive. Duplexing is a real bonus and the purchase price is low. If I had a second chance, I would have shopped around more."
4,as advertised...,Cosmetic upgrade only... serves no useful purpose but... It gives the pistol a much needed angrier look than a .22 long rifle normally has?! lol
2,Cord is shedding white stuff...broken,"Bought for husband to replace cotton one that rotted away in only two years. The poly cord is shedding whitish stuff which means he won't use it anymore. So the ""no rot"" aspect has been trumped by the ""ruins clothes and possibly toxic"" problems. We've had it too long to return.Also, had to return the first one because the stretcher bar had a crack all the way through. You would think they would have seen that.UPDATE JULY 19, 2008: The replacement one has broken two ropes would have broken more if it's intended victim hadn't leaped for safety. After less then four months of use it is broken and useless. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,Don't bother with this one!,"We had this less that 2 months and my 6 year old daughter sat down on it to get in it and ended up on the ground! It completly came apart. I guess it just couldn't hold her 50 pound body! So dissappointed in this, it was truly junk, don't waste your time or money! These are completly worthless!"
1,Lying on the ground with a hurting back,"I have owned this hammock for 2-3 months. It looks great and appears as if it will hold up well. It has been treated well, but today when I laid in it, the ropes from the spreader bars to the posts snapped in half leaving me lying on the ground. This has lasted less time than a cotton hammock and is not a good choice to purchase. Learn from my mistakes."
1,If I could leave 0 stars...,"It barely lasted a summer before it rotted & I fell through it. Save your money for a quality hammock, this is not it. A friend bought one right after me & his cracked and broke at the crossbar. So they're 2 for 2 here, no good."
5,Great book,"Read this in Russia in original, this is surely one great book!!! It is easy to read and is very intriguing. Highly recommend!"
5,"SMOOTH, COMFORTABLE, QUIET","This razor was a pleasant surprise! It is very smooth, has an extremely comfortable grip, and is exceptionally quiet. For the price, I believe this razor is a BEST BUY!"
4,It does the job,"I have a few minor quibbles with this razor, but it gives you a nice close, comfortable shave. And isn't that what we want in the end?I don't know anyone who buys one of these things for its ""ergonomic design features."" It holds the charge for a good long time, and shaves your face nice. Rinse it clean with running water and you're done. That's what I'm looking for.The only things keeping me from a 5 star review is I'm not yet comfortable with how the razor sounds when running. It seems like it's always needing a charge...but that's how it sounds at full charge. It will take some getting used to I guess..others might find the quiet running mode a plus.Also, the monthly cleaning of the cutters/combs is a bit complicated."
1,Good Shave Poor Battery Don't Buy!,"This razor did an excellent job until it was about 3 months old, the battery would not hold a charge. I have owned several rechargable razors before with no issues; only charge when the battery runs down, etc...It is now a corded razor and I cannot recommend it to anyone. Looks like several others had the same problem."
4,Great product for the price,"It gives a very close shave to my father, whose face is not as angular as mine. In ""straight"" places on my face, it shaves well. Shaves almost as close as a blade (maybe a millimiter difference), however, in places on my face where there are hard and sudden turns, I need to go over that area again and again and again, to the point where I get rough rashes and spend nearly 30 minutes shaving. For my face, which is very angular and unround, I guess every electric razor will not fit. But, if you have a round or average face, you won't be disappointed with this model. (Results after a month of use) The price now is 10-15$ more than what it was when I bought it from Amazon."
4,Norelco 7240XL,"Fine product,shaves well and holds it's charge for eight to ten shaves.Hard to beat at the price."
4,great QUIET shaver,"my old (3 years?) norelco needed new blades again, so I decided that rather then spend nearly the same amount on blades, I would instead get this newer (discounted) shaver for nearly the same.feels nicer then my old one, seems to give a closer shave (could be the new blades though), and new rechargeable batteries sure hold longer then the old unit, but what surprised me the most is how incredibly quiet it is.i'm not crazy about the wanna be high tech design, but in the end, could really care less either way. the old shaver had more streamlined lines. like the difference between looking at a nice sporty car with great lines, and then looking at one of those butchered hummers these days.if you can get this at a good price, don't hesitate."
4,Still Early,"I've only used this shaver for the past 10 days.It does a very good job, and is so quiet, I haveto make sure it's on. Too bad this doesn't comewith it's own stand, that's why I'm deductingone star."
5,One of the best shavers I ever owned,"The closest shave, easy to clean. Only problem, replacement heads unavailable as of this writing"
4,Needs Low Charge Indicator,"My husband reports:I would buy this again because it gives me a comfortable, close shave. What I don't like is that there is no warning when the battery runs out of power. One moment you are shaving and the next you have to find the cord to complete your shave.It takes a good 8 hours to recharge the unit.My previous Norelcos charged in about 2 to 3 hours...but the copy did report this so I knew what I was getting into. It would be a good idea to just charge the razor every 8 - 10 days for the way I shave, you might need to charge it sooner."
4,From a blade man,"90% of the time I shave with the standard lather and blade. I have owned a Norelco for about 10 years and usually use it for a quick shave. Decieded it was time to get a new one, as replacement blades for the old were not much less than a new shaver.Got it yesterday, used it this morning and have to say that I was very impressed. Very quiet. Did an excellent job, not as close as a blade, but not bad. Certainly better than my old Norelco. To be fair, the old one needed new blades.Overall, I am very happy with this new unit and would recommend it to someone who just wants a basic unit."
5,New Razor,"Best I've used. Looks strange (space age) but works great. Quiet, close shave, holds a charge well, cleans easy. I've not tried rinsing under the faucet as we have high mineral content water but just blowing and brushing work well. Best I've tried. Very happy."
5,"Exelente rasuradora, muy recomendable.","Nunca antes habia usado una rasuradora siempre use rastrillo y la primera vez que la use tenia una barba de 5 dias, me dejo muy bien rasurado, nada de puntos negros sino al raz, estoy muy sorprendido del resultado, la recomiendo ampliamente, ademas las cabezas de las hojas tienen una duracion de un año. vale la pena la inversion y el resultado es muy bueno."
4,Darth Vader's Electric Razor,"Don't let the fact that this razor looks like something out of a Ridley Scott sci-fi thriller turn you off. It works like a charm. It's quiet, provides a close/clean shave, and doesn't feel like it's pulling your whiskers out one at a time. I've always enjoyed the Norelco patented ""Lift-and-Cut"" system, but my previous Norelco model was painful to use--especially with longer growth. With this model, longer whiskers are no problem. You can also clean this razor using running water from your faucet--a nice feature if you're like me and hate to bang the head out on your waste basket spilling whiskers everywhere. The only reason I didn't give this product 5/5 stars was due to the functionality of the sideburns trimmer. It cuts just fine, but it folds back too easily while you're trying to use it. I've had this razor now for over a month and would definitely recommend it to others."
4,Norelco 7240,"I bought this unit to replace an older Norelco, and was quite pleased with the closeness of the shave. While not as good as shaving with a blade, which is my normal way of shaving, it does a very acceptable job when in a hurry and not wanting to take the time for using the blade. All in all, quite pleased with the unit. Really like the ability to clean the shaver head under water. Don't like the cover, as much more difficult to put on that previous cover,"
5,Good Basic Shaver,"Although you cant expect this shaver to give the same feel as a blade, this razor gives a close shave with minimal effort. The unit feels comfortable in the hand and the charge lasts for a week or more of daily shaves. The re=charge period is less than 4 hours. The unit comes with the compact recharging unit, barely more than a core."
4,"Works well, few shortcomings","I bought this shaver a while back because I wanted to switch back from a razor. First of all, it looks really cool. This is a really stupid reason to buy a shaver, but I guess Philips knows that consumers do stupid things. The shave is pretty good. I have always shaved well with electric shavers, and this one preforms well too. It is pretty easy to clean, and it holds a charge well. The trimmer on the side is a little anemic. There is no dial to change the closeness of the shave, and I do miss that feature quite a bit. All in all, its a pretty good device. If I had more money, though, I would have bought a nicer shaver."
2,wait a sec. definitely not a 4.5 star.,"Out of the box, this was a disappointment. The motor was weak and it barely shaved any of my moustache. When I turned this on, it honestly felt and sounded like another shaver that's at 5% battery level. I was beginning to think that mine was just a defect but then decided against doing anything because the rotary type did not seem to be a good fit for me. I don't have a thick beard, and the shape of the shaver doesn't work well for cutting above the mouth hair.this looks ok, but it feels light and cheap."
5,"Good value, good product!","I bought this shaver for my husband, not knowing much at all about electric shavers. Much to my delight he loves it! Apparently it is much lighter weight and gives a much smoother shave than his old one did. He's very pleased with it overall."
5,Chasing the Gender Dream,"Jennifer Merrill Thompson's Chasing the Gender Dream isa valuable tool for anyone considering the possibilitiesand options of gender selection.You will find details, documentation, and arguments for andagainst the methods, procedures, and studies of diets, Dr.Shettles, O+12, Whelan, Ericsson, Microsort and PGDpreimplantation gender diagnosis). The Appendix lists links tostudy and resource sites and materials and clinics.Jennifer shares years of research, personal stories, and combinesthem to make Chasing the Gender Dream an enjoyable read aswell as informative."
5,"Was skeptical, but works great!!","Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by this item!! Our dishwasher is getting old and it really does not get the glassware sparkling clean. It leaves a film or residue that that the ""spray"" will not remove. I tried the Polder and it completely removed that accumulated film left behind by the dishwasher!!! You can also get replacement brushes from Amazon for it. It was exactly what I was looking for and it performs great. Perfect for home use!!!!"
5,Great product,"I dislike putting my hand into glasses and cups to wash them and some thick drinks such as smoothies and ice cream drinks are not cleaned well in a dishwasher. I first saw a device similar to this product used by a bartender. It seemed to work well so I purchased one. Since then I have purchased two more; one for myself and one for my son. This particular product is sturdy and well made. The suction cups on the underside of the base secure it well to the bottom of the sink. The side-by-side brushes clean both the inside and outside of the glass. It is so easy to use that one can wash glasses quite well even after ""having a few"". A word of caution however: the brushes are too wide to use to wash most champagne flutes without cracking them."
5,"Yes yes yes. If you hand-wash glasses, just buy it.","Having broken perhaps $100 worth of expensive wine glasses over time while hand-washing them, I only wish I had discovered this extremely easy-to-use product sooner. Why aren't these better-known? Washing is faster, easier, safer, and more effective than when I use a hand-held brush or sponge. Nice item."
5,Look ma I'm using one hand.,I recently lost use of one of my hands and I since I can't get the bandages wet for a long time I've realized that having use of two hands is something we take for granted. Washing glasses has become a challenge but with this sink brush I can get my glasses clean.
3,"Almost impossible to watch but beautiful to listen, buy CD","I bought this DVD because I have heard Kasarova singing several times and I admired it, also I loved the productions in Munich opera house.I have not seen this alive performance in Munich and was very exctited when I started to watch this DVD. Now I am listening the opera and wrtiting this review because I cannot take it any longer. I love this opera and it is hurtful to see what they did with it. Totally idiotic : angel turn to the clown with naked baby doll and so on... I am sorry but please, just buy CD an enjoy it, unless you close your eyes and listen..."
4,Good Turkey,"Good music from 70's.This ""Turkey"" is their second release.This release contains many live bonus track.In my opinion this bears comparison with their first, excellent ""Battle Hymn"".One good/important thing is singer's recognizable voice.Booklet is quite poor, but contains short band/Glenn Cornickrewiew."
5,Present,"This was a Christmas present. My fiancee really likes music, and has been wanting this! :) He's very happy with it! :)"
1,poor,"This is such a poor version of a true master piece of TV production.Much regrets for this purchase, this type of poor piece of commercial exploitation is encouraging illegal dowloading."
5,A must read before investing in trust deeds!,"This is a book you must read before EVER investing in trust deeds! Gives you the straight scoop. The risks, the rewards, what to investigate BEFORE investing. Don't invest in trust deeds without reading this book first! - Aimee Elizabeth, Author of Poverty Sucks! How to Become a Self-Made Millionaire."
5,What we have become,"I had to read this book for an Anthropology class I am taking and I am so glad. It is very insightful and easy reading. Once I started I could not put it down, very informative. Highly recommend to anyone interested in the Mexican-American culture."
1,Terribly boring,"The history and culture of Central America is so fascinating, and I learned so much from studying abroad in Belize and Guatemala this summer, but I could not get through this book. The writing is dry and fails to present the ideas in a coherent and exciting way. The book is weighted down by its heavy historical sections, which are written much like a grade school textbook, not in the elegant and engaging style of great writers like Sherry Ortner. Don't get me wrong...I love history, especially this particular topic. But despite its title, this book fails to emphasize the dynamics of the rich history and mixed culture of Central America and display those dynamics to the reader."
5,Looking for a copy?,"If anybody is looking for a copy of this book, it's still available from the author, Josef Jackson who lives in Grand Island, Nebraska."
5,great product!,"this is a wonderful, RARE CD to be found. There are not too many relaxing, dinosaur sounds with light music out there. It takes you back to an strange world with alien sounds! I would suggest snatching up this jewel while you can!"
3,THE JURY IS STILL OUT,"First, www.AMAZON.com is great. Got my monitor in 3 days. no problem good price. Easy to deal with compared to DELL(that's another story.THe SAMSUNG - Am running it in analog mode(while waiting for my new DELL).PROS Picture is crisp, and fairly uniform on web browsing, PC text apps. (after having a lot of blurring at first, fiddled w/the profile settings and took care of it) Ran a DVD (WOODY ALLEN in BANANAS). Excellent picture, not ""ghosting"" or bluring, high color fidelity.CONS: The Color management/profiling software included is completely bizarre. Documentation practically non-existant.The controls on the monitor are also bizarre, you have to go through a sequence of about 4 buttons just to make one adjustment.Am having a real hard time getting a decent calibration with Photoshop. Yes, it's inherently difficult w/LCDS but not impossible. Problem is toning down the brightness enough.Jury is still out on this one..."
4,Super looking monitor,"As an LCD monitor, the Smsung 191T gives very crsip, bright colors. I'm connecting it analog right now, but will use DVI as soon as I get my new alienware computer. I can't comment on gaming issues yet, since I hacen't/can't play games on my current computer. I would like to give 5 stars, but my monitor actually has two ""stuck on"" pixels. It's not that big a deal since they're so tiny. Nevertheless, it's still disappointing. Buying LCDS in such a large screen size is pretty much hit or miss when it comes to being ""perfect pixels"" or having ""dead pixels.""The other monitor that I was strongly considering was the 19"" NEC Multisync. In general,if you are a hardcore gamer, I don't think it's ideal to play games on LCD's above 17"" Still, I'm going to play games with this samsung, and when I do, I will return with another review."
3,"Beautiful monitor, but...","This monitor turns heads; even my TV delivery people were drawn to it across a room. It's slick, modern, extremely light, and looks like a floating window--the border around the screen is so narrow it takes up less space than your average 17"" TFT. But... the first unit I've received has terrible ghosting and seems to be out of alignment pixel-wise; no amount of adjustment is fixing it. So I'm sending it back. But I figure this is probably not a problem with the design, just with my unit in particular. At least, I hope so. Because I'm requesting another one. The Viewsonic VX900 is a backup if this doesn't work out, but staying with the Samsung is what I hope to do."
5,"Samsung SyncMaster 191T 19"" LCD","great monitor, good price, i have owned mine for the better part of two years now. i have recommended it to all my friends, and four others have the same one and they seem very happy with it. Clear text, and fantastic picture quality. everything is included and although it does the Pivot deal with the picture, never really used it. it has adjustable height and tilt. only problem with this monitor is i cannot find another one. Samsung has other models out but this one is discontinued. i'd recommend this monitor for anyone that spends SERIOUS time in front of the computer."
4,"Nice upgrade from my 17"" CRT","This was my first purchase of an LCD. The screen is nice and bright, text is clear and crisp, and after fiddling with the colors a bit - the colors are really nice.In fact, that is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5: having to fiddle with the colors. But in all fairness, I had my CRT in place for more than 3 years and don't remember if I had to adjust the colors when I set it up.If I had to do it over again, I would buy this again."
3,Good for static pictures very bad for motion pictures,"It's very good for the regular computer work. But it is unacceptable for me to watch videos. Fast movements are very ghosty. I compared it with my old 17"" Sony CRT screen. I was using Radeon VE 32mb video card and GForce 4 Ti 4400 128mb card. Windoze XP and Linux. Analog and DVI. No difference. After warching 1 hour DVD I had very unpleasant feelings and pressure in my eyes."
4,TRACK LISTING HERE:,1. We Are the Reason2. You Put This Love In My Heart3. And Can It Be?4. I Just Came to Praise the Lord5. Old Time Gospel Medley6. You Are My Wholeness7. He Hideth My Soul8. Themes of Wroship9. The Lord's Prayer
4,What happened?,"Apparently Michael Bolton underwent a transformation After ""Everybody's Crazy."" The biggest change? This is a great album! It comes with a killer package of hard rock and soft ballads, making it a beautifully put together record. Although I wasn't a big fan of ""Take A Look At My Face,"" it just sounded too 80's for me. But otherwise, good stuff, Michael."
2,Michael's First TOP 40,"This album by Michael Bolton is the one containing his very first Top 40 hit, THAT'S WHAT LOVE IS ALL ABOUT.The rest of the tracks appearing on the album are very much oriented in the direction of Eddie Money's, Journey's and Steve Perry's kind of sound.The production is accurate, though it failed to prove a greater impact on the audience.Other worth-listening tunes are Michael's rendition of SITTIN' ON THE DOCK OF THE BAY (the only other song made the Top 40) and GINA.You also will find here the very first collaboration - of many more to come - between Michael and Diane Warren on WALK AWAY."
1,Better To Hunger Than To Hurt,This awful singer's commercial breakthrough. Pray it goes out of print before you hear it.
1,Michael Bolton is A No Talent Ass Clown,"I apologize to all Bolton fans out there for my earlier comments. I just don't like Michael Bolton and probably never will. I just don't find his music entertaining at all. This album is just a collection of all the things i trully hate about the man. Maybe I'm beng unjust to Mr. Bolton, but still, its my opinion and I'll understand if fans want to lash out at me for my comments. But I'd also like to say hello to my new friend 85 Delorian. How can you give one star to the Bible, but five to Michael Bolton???? Are you just stupid or a jerk? I don't know. So again apologies to Amazon and the good fans of Michael Bolton, but to 85 Delorian I say this: THPPPPPPT!!!!"
2,packaging not great,"Better to buy the cereal that you like best, and portion it out into zip lock containers. On these the lids were off on a few of them. Plus the portion size is for like a small kid, one of my portions is 3 of these containers."
3,several boxes NOT sealed,The box arrived quickly - all 96 boxes were in a box - that was fine - while putting them away - heard something at bottom of box - several boxes of cereal were open and all over! Very disappointedBut it seems like a manufacturering problem - they were not sealed correctly!
1,Trans fats!?,"I was going to buy these until I saw that they contained trans fats (partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in Cocoa Crispies, Fruit Loops, and Corn Pops). Who wants to send their kids off to school loaded up with deadly trans fats?"
4,Water filtration repalcement discs,"Purchased the Mr Coffee water filter at Walmart for $3.64. This is the complete system which consists of frame, filter disk and disk cover. Only need to relace the filter disk monthly. Can buy the 6 pack of the disks from MrCoffeeStore or Amazon for $14.99 at this time. We have a filter system on the sink in our home; but when the Mr. Coffee water filtration system is used there is white sediment (calcium buildup) on the filter because we have such nasty water. To clean the system we just run water over to wash off the sediment and then once a month change the disk. For $2.49 a month it is worth it when you see the junk the filter keep out of you coffee grounds and your machnie."
1,Yikes,I removed this item from my cart at checkout....$9.40 for shipping 10 little coffee filters!! I will pay more at Wal Mart and be happy!
1,Not what I expected,I thought when I purchased this item that I was getting as it stated '..the water filter replacement disk' but what I got was the entire assembly that houses the disk and the disk. I had the housing I only needed the replacement disk as was stated. Also the picture shows how the replacement disks come - two to a package. This came one assembly to a package. Not at all clear. :-(
3,Mr Coffee water filter,"The filter works as designed and arrived on time. The only problem is the shipping fees are high. If they were easier to find in stores I would buy them there, but they can be difficult to find and gas and time add up."
5,We have used them ever since we purchased our Mr. Coffee!,For the last 4 years we use an new one of these every 5 to 6 weeks. We actually think is makes our coffee taste better. We are on city water and we even filter the cool water we drink and I can tell you that it tastes better and does not have the chemical taste that water out of the tap has.The package claims that it removes 97% of the Chlorine from your water. Based on the change in the taste of the coffee I believe it. I also find other sediments trapped in the charcoal filter and on top of it. I have become a believer of this filter and for me it is worth the money. I recommend it to you.
3,just a basic Hard Drive media player,"Its good at what it does basically plays avi,jpeg,mp3 files. It sports a basic not too fancy menu/file manager,actually the outside case looks better.I would suggest using it for your media storage,or for portability. As for your downloaded content in another format it would help converting the video format though obviously you may lose video quality. Also some ideal improvements to add to this player would be a bluetooth transmitter and Gold-Plated shielded A/V cables. btw you can also store other files on here that you would usually store on an external drive, they just wouldn't show up under the menu."
1,Alaskan adventures,I have yet to receive this book so I am of course most unhappy.I understand the book is great.If I ever receive it Ill let you know my opinion.
3,A volume of lesbian stories,"Even though Lindsay Welsh is one of my favorite authors of lesbian erotica, I still found 3 to be the correct rating for this book. The stories, - where Province Town is the first, - are covering the whole range of erotica of this gender, from romantic sensuality to strict domination and dicipline.The rating is not higher because i think Welsh is at her best when she describes D/s relationships explicitly, like later in her excellent novel ""Necessary Evil"", and the way the stories are mixed somhow seems just thrown together without any attempt to compose a total work. Maybe that's the idea, just fantasies varying with the mood from day to day?......"
3,item,"I needed this item as a joke! A good gift, but a little pricy for such a small piece of almost nothing."
3,Focuses on detailed naval architecture of the Royal Navy.,"Very detailed descriptions of the naval architecture of the Royal Navy from the introduction of the ironclad through to the Dreadnought. The details will be of interest to architects and constructors rather than the general reader. The text assumes a naval architect's background and vocabulary on the part of the reader. Mostly deals with capital ships in the Royal Navy. Not enough detail on either the personalities of individuals behind the ships, ship engagements during the period, or developments in the ships of the Royal Navy's competitor nations. Interesting diagrams and photographs."
3,small,"This booklet is little, only about 4""x6"". The stickers are good quality and a nice finishing touch on envelopes or valentines. I got these for my little girl, age 7."
2,Ok,"Colors were a bit dull and pictures were blurry. These do not have a very strong adhesive. Seems to stick just fine to regular plain writing paper, but that is about it. Bought these to stick on goodie bags for my daughters birthday party and they were peeling all around the edges. The bags were basic paper bags with a light coating that my children or I have decorated with stickers many times. This was the first time we encountered any issues."
5,Not To Be Taken Literally,"This is a fantastically funny book with great writing and great illustrations: Spinky's sullen mood is particularly well-captured. Note to those who dislike this book: the story is an example of humor through exaggeration. I think that kids understand exaggeration intuitively. At least I hope they do.The story is funny because Spinky's sullen attitude is extreme -- but admit it, haven't you ever felt this way.? ""They don't appreciate me! I'll show them! They'll be sorry!"" Steig has done a magnificent job of capturing the unreasonable attitude of a sulker. I've given this book to sulkers, and they laughed with delight when they recognized their ""bad attitudes."" A great book."
4,Spinky Sulks,"In Spinky Sulks the person who made this book is Willem Steig. The book is about this kid he is really mad. This kid is so mad he stays outside. He is mad at his mom, sister, brother, and his dad. This book is a great book because it is funny at the end when he dresses up like a clown.By Alexis Ellis, in Mr. Ewings P.S. you should read it. This kid is like me!!!!!"
4,One Bad Attitude,This story is about a boy named Spinky and his bad attitude. Every time his family did something he didn't like he would start to sulk and climb into his hammock. His family tries everything to cheer him up. His sister even picks daisies for him but he just throws them on the ground. I think people can really relate to this book. This book is very interesting to read. I like this book a lot.
4,SRV is/was great !,What a loss. SRV reached superstar status and then like other superstars was cut down in his prime. I read other reviews about this release but I personally love this recording and if you have enough money I suggest you also buy the box set which has some live tracks as well and pick up a vhs/dvd of Stevie playing live. His rendition of voodoo child will drop your jaw.
1,save your money,"There's a reason you can buy a used copy on Amazon for less than 2 bucks.This is a hugely disappointing album.I remember buying it when it came out and thinking ""this IS NOT how SRV sounded when I saw him in concert...this sucks"".It's the only album by SRV & DT that I've not replaced on CD.Ya want Stevie at his best LIVE? Get El Mocambo.El Mocambo demonstrates to a T why Stevie became the legend he was and continues to be.Long live the memory of Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble!"
3,Going Down Down Down,"Recorded several months before Stevie collapsed in a drug and alcohol induced stuper. Frankly, I still recommend this album because there are several tracks, such as Wilie the Wimp that flat out rock. Everything you have read about overdubs etc are true. Still, this recording is still historically important."
2,"Decent, but certainly doesn't capture his guitar prowess","In light of some of the other live material that has been released by Stevie Ray, this certainly doesn't compare. Because of drugs or whatever, his playing seems uninspired and labored. He seems to play much of his songs with less enthusiam than at other times in his career. Compare ""Live Alive"" with other albums such as ""In the Beginning"" or the El Mocambo video. Those recordings show Stevie Ray at his finest, his playing inspired, and his emotions desperate, as if it would be his final performance. Unfortunately ""Live Alive"" doesn't not have the same feel or the same technical prowess displayed in some of the other of Stevie Ray's releases."
1,This is not the REAL Stevie,"Sorry, but this CD doesn't match with what Stevie had recorded in studio untill then. Stevie's fire is absent here, lots of keyboards and overdubs. I bought this when it was a double vinyl record and I felt sooo sorry! I couldn't believe this was the same Stevie that I had just got to know with ""Couldn't stand the weather"" (undoubtly his best effort) and ""Soul to soul"". The recording is also disappointing. Save your money to the REAL Great Stevie."
5,A must own for any blues enthusiast!,The world lost a friend when SRV passed away. His albums all come alive when you put them on. Look for his latest compilation with never before released tracks. It was put together by his brother Jimmie.
3,Difficult to rate,Pay attention- this album is for srv's fans. Not the best of his live work. This album was greatly redone in the studio so first of all- it's not really that live of an album. Don't get me wrong- there really isn't anything bad on the album Change it may even be a better version. Leaving you and superstition are the only songs not on his other albums that are worth it [ Srv himself remarked after sobering up that he thought willie the wimp was in badtaste and didn't want it on radio]. If you're a big fan go ahead and get it... after you get all the other stuff. If you are a casual fan of Stevie's blues and blues rock and occasional jazz- any of his other albums live or otherwise would be better. It's a good album but at the bottom of stevie's work taking under consideration the availibility of the songs and so on. So buy it if you have his other stuff and can't stand not having these 3 songs.
5,Amazing,"I develops asthma suddenly and was put on several steroid inhalers, nose spray, zrytec, and pills for coughing, which they all sort of helped but i felt would make me sicker in the long run. I had sever itching ear canals that were driving me insane and I had crazy sneezing. My acupuncturist weened me off of all these and put me on a mix of Classical Chinese pearls and Aller-DMG. It's amazing. It made my itchy ears, sneezing, and asthma better. It's an amazing product. Today I take nothing except for the occasional Aller-DMG when my allergys get bad."
2,Very disappointing book,"This book looks like you will learn a lot as there are 50 tutorials.Unfortunately, many are redundant, many are not really significant (not really useful, just funny), and the last one is a filler as it teaches you how to make a projector.If you are buying this book from a library, take your time to review the center page that display each ""Technique"" in color.It is worth half the price it costs. Not a great deal anyway. At least, you get the source files.This book is for beginner who wants to have a bit of fun."
4,Easy to learn,I think this is a great book for beginners. They give you some easy plans to follow step-by-step (so you don't screw-up) so hopefully by the end of the book you can really do some damage by yourself. Bonus: They give you all the source codes and pictures so you don't have to start from scratch.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because some of the techniques are really useless like creating a calculator!
1,One star for every USEFUL technique...,"I gave this book 1 star for every useful technique that I found in it. You do the counting.Needless to say, I am very disappointed with my purchase. If you are, like me, an intermediate Flash developer looking to add a few new tricks to your bag, you are out of luck. Most of the techniques in this book are either too primitive or unusable in the field, or both..."
5,My favorite Hubbard adventure story,"The Coast Guard never seemed a likely setting for a high action thriller when I first read the story description to The Phantom Patrol. But having not been disappointed in reading Hubbards adventures, I figured I'd give it a shot. I was really impressed by how I was immediately pulled into the story and raced through to the end of the story. It has everything a great action story needs: a great hero, a beautiful and strong female, a really good bad guy. Based on his description of officers in this story, you also get the idea that Hubbard roots for the soldier in the field, not the officer behind the desk who has never seen action. All in all, a very enjoyable read."
2,Better Than a Cruise to ENSENADA for the ears !,"With the voice talents of: Michael Yurchak (Naruto),Phil Proctor(Assassin's Creed) and Jim Meskimen (Batman: Arkham City).Hubbard really could make you feel like you are really in the moment of story,He was telling.The voice actors on this audiobook effectively recreate his words for our ears, Bring us to the sea and battles and sheer action.The lead (Yurchak voiced) is in a bit of trouble with the Coast Guard and the Law on land, But,He was framed by a modern day pirate.This a wild ride for the ears and would be a distraction on a cruise,Okay maybe a un-nerving earful for the imagination...But,Safer than ENSENADA these days."
4,A great alternative to pink.,"I got these earmuffs for my girlfriend to use during recreational shooting. She wanted shooting gear that was pretty, girly, and not ""cancer pink.""The earmuffs are solid, functional, and the iridescent finish is eye-catching. They seem very well made for the price.The only downside is that they are far from low-profile, so they might prevent proper cheek-weld while shooting long guns. However, their bulkiness is evident from the product image."
4,They are pretty.,"They work great, but it is difficult to adjust to fit your head, & if you have a bigger than average sized cranium I would't buy this product. As for protecting your ears from loud noise it works GREAT in that aspect."
4,Great little shoe!,"I really love these shoes! I was a bit wary about these being Tommy Bahama brand (seems like an old, retired-person brand to me & I'm 25) but I'm so glad I bought these! They're really comfy and the slightly pointed toe cap is SO cute and adds that feminine touch to it.The first time I wore these, the heel back cut into my achilles and were ridiculously painful. After that, I bought some heel pads from Target for $4 and it's been nothing but smooth sailing ;) since then. The love it as a slip on and it's really comfy. You can really tell that it's well made once you're wearing them.Love these shoes!"
5,At last! It's on DVD!,"I've waited awhile to get this film on DVD -- the old VHS version just doesn't do it justice. Take a deep breath, if you haven't seen it before. A serious film that should be on everyone's ""to see"" list."
2,mismatched,"Wright's vocal do little but frustrate Tiersen's melody. She is consistently off-pitch, consistently over dramatic and breathy, and the lyrics read like something out a highschool journal, one with READ OR DIE poured over it in black sharpie. I was hopeful - after the first 4 tracks, which are the best on the record, I was hopeful that they would be able to tie it all together. The mood was lush and interesting - Yann has done a nice job, but still I cringe with every listen.Maybe I will grow to appreciate Wright's vocals, but I don't think so. Tiersen may not be good enough to make this good enough to buy."
5,Awesome TV Stand!!,"This TV stand was perfect!! It was super-easy to set-up, our flat-screen plasma TV fit perfect on there, and it was a great price!! It looks great in the living room, I highly recommend this product!"
4,sturdy,"i got it as expected, very sturdy, can hold up the 42 inch perfectly, also holds up the 50 inch (i upgraded) still sturdy but shakes a little when pushed..shouldnt be a problem"
2,Left post was manufactured improperly,"I don't know if it was my specific unit, but the left post (when you look at it from the front) has a screwhole that was not indented. The right post works fine with the 2 screwholes indented. The left post has 1 screwhole indented and another that isn't. Therefore, with the short screws Panasonic provided it cannot reach the crossbar. I'm going to try using some other screws and a nut to finish the job, but I expected more from Panasonic, especially if they're going to charge $160 for a piece of plastic and metal. The item was manufactured in China so what do you expect.Also tried tracking down the department at Panasonic to send me the part. Good luck. They have 50 million departments. After 20 transfers and 2 hours on the phone, I gave up."
3,Good book for its day,"This book belongs with a short list of excellent books published in the 1960's. These include Weisberg's ""Whitewash"" series, Lane's ""Rush to Judgement"", Sylvia Meagher's ""Accessories After the Fact"", James Hepburn's ""Farewell America"", and Leo Sauvage's ""The Oswald Affair"". This book broke new ground in that it was the first commercially published book to describe the actual assassination plot, and not merely take pot shots at the wretched Warren Commision Report.It has since been superceded, however, by the brilliant research group headed by Professor James Fetzer, who has edited three books concerning the JFK assassination: ""Assassination Science"", ""Murder in Dealey Plaza"", and his latest, ""The Great Zapruder Film Hoax"". These books should be ordered from Amazon before the government pulls them from circulation."
3,Halloween?,"First I'll say my kids like this video. That's most important. There are a couple of strange things about it that I noticed. First, neither the packaging nor anything in the story indicate it - but the title on screen says ""Halloween is Grinch Night"" and you never see a reference to Halloween again. The date on the box is 1971, while at the end of the movie it is 1977. The music is painfully forgettable. Hans Conreid is a decent substitute as the voice of the Grinch."
2,This is for young and true Grinch fans only!,"I enjoyed Grinch Night. I am one of the few. If you are a die-hard Grinch fan, this will either be a great pre-Christmas Grinch fix, or, you will be offended that they could ever try to re-capture the ingeniusness of The Grinch in a non-HTGSC format. This is a Halloween story, about how the Grinch comes down from his mountain once a year to scare the Whos. We all know that this not true, but it's ok. It isn't horrible, and the music is really fun. But does it cut the mustard as a long-standing Grinch classic? Heck no."
5,Maski Show - Orfei and Euridica / Otello,"This group is better than 'Mr Bean' or Charlie Chaplin in that they can be understood in any language - they generally rely on action, not words. Recommend to anybody. I would love to have the complete set of all the shows I saw while staying in Ukraine."
5,Skillz,"I think the CD is dope, Im really digging Problems II Solve and Tell Dem is really hott I like the different styles that it has, I think that the music is real talk I can feel where they're coming from Most of all, Like I said B4 Im really feeling how they all have there different styles. BIG UPS TO PTS"
2,Not the best,"I live in Japan and I find this book not too useful. Whenever I hear a slang word that I don't know, I would try to look it up in this book but 95% of the time it's not there. It's fun to read the entries on its own, but it's not very comprehensive and a bit outdated. Also, the sections are arranged in a not so easy to use format. I wished that I had spent my money on something else."
2,English Slang,"The English slang in this book is weird. He uses words like ""hanky-panky"" and ""comes unglued"". I don't get it at all."
1,got worse and worse,"About a year ago, a black horizontal line showed up on the screen and never went away. Since then, more and more have shown up. Now I have 23 black lines going across the whole screen, each one pixel wide. The monitor has now begun to flicker randomly, so I've about had it with this thing. I emailed NEC and they basically said I could pay to have them try to fix it. There are a lot newer and better models out there, so don't bother with this piece of junk."
5,Multi-functional. Great during recipe prep. Bought extras to use as a gentle scraper when cleaning kitchen counters,"These bowl scrapers are not only an excellent value but can be used in many areas of the house. In the kitchen, I use them as bowl scrapers- as intended. They are much better than mere spatulas.But they also help me clean my stone and laminate countertops quickly. First, I take a dust pan or small trash container and use the scraper to remove any loose material. Then I spray a liquid cleaner on the counters- or simply use a wet microfiber cloth.Once wet, any stubborn or hardened food paricles or stains can be easily removed with the bowl scraper. The plastic is very unlikely to cause scratches. I've never had a single one, even when used on laminate bathroom counters.This is also the ideal size- neither too small or too large."
3,Q and A book,"This book is pretty good. It is in a question and answer format for the most part, but with a few cases mixed in. There are some chapters that appeaar to be written by a non-english native, as some of the words do not make sense!Overall, I'm glad I bought it, but I think if I only had time for one book, I would go with more of a scenario-based one. Also, this version is a bit out-of-date. I haven't had the FP board yet."
2,Written by an Archdeacon to disprove Solomon's good-will,"Unfortunately, this book is written from the Christian perspective, disproving the Jewish perspective. The book is written by an Archdeacon and Canon and states the following things; ""Solomon's heart not perfect"", ""due to the general impulse given to Jewish thought, by Solomon, though it cannot have been written by him"", ""frequent references to the book in the New Testament"". Really? Or is it just the Archdeacon writing a Biography and finding references that fit, as is customary?Unpleased. Only the people who really understand their King should write about him."
5,Review ON THIS SPOT,"This is the answer to the question that's always intrigued kids: ""who was here before me?"" Starting with the present and going back to pre-history, the book answers that question with a clear and engaging text. It is also beautiful to look at and would please children of all ages."
4,Basic and Inspirational for Mature or Maturing Christians,"This book is basic and inspirational for mature or maturing Christian. It can be summarized as: ""Not I, but Christ who lives in me."" I first read it in 1981 and have returned to it 5 or 6 times over the years. Now I am considering its use in discipling others. Each reading is short enough to be read devotionally. He doesn't waste words. Very appropriate and non-flowery language marshalling each word to clarify his point."
5,Highly recommended for new Christians,"Although a Christian for a number of years, I never heard teaching like this. The reformed churches stifle ""grace teaching"" even though they throw in the word 'grace' into the mix once in a while. Positional teaching like this has opened my eyes to all that I am in Christ already--there is nothing left for me to do but believe and appropriate all that is mine. This is foundational faith teaching that I wish I would have heard as a new Christian but am nonetheless thankful to have come across it."
5,Green Letters,"Very condensed and well thought out material, not the sort of thing you read anymore today"
5,Great help for the Christian walk!,"I first became acquainted with ""The Green Letters"" back in the mid-70's. God inspired Miles J. Stanford to clearly and succinctly capture the basic dynamics of the victorious Christian walk.The book has been an inspiration to me over the years. I cannot express how helpful this little 90-page book has been to me personally ... time and again. I have bought hundreds of copies in my years of ministry, passing them to individuals with whom I have counseled about spiritual matters. I have bought copies for group studies.The whole book is great ... do not get me wrong about that. However, Stanford's three chapters on Appropriation, Identification and Consecration (a mere 15 or so pages, should be daily reading for every believer. Those are the areas that so many Christians miss, and, basically, have no clue concerning.Buy it! Read it! Apply it!"
3,ponderous,"This is a classic in Christian literature and one they say should be read by every Christian, and I suppose I can see why. It covers the basics of faith and there is some good stuff contained within, but I found Stanford's writing style to be very ponderous and just uninteresting which made it hard to follow. There are better Christian writers to read."
5,Perfect.,"Released in the spring of 1987, Belle's debut album, ""All By Myself"", revealed a woman whose vocal style and timbre were unquestionably all her own.Belle and pop-R&B; producer Nick Martinelli gave singles such as ""Show Me the Way"" and "" So Many Tears"" the kind of warm, subtle interpretation that has since become Belle's trademark.Another gem is the song "" After The Love Has Lost Its Shine"",which every time you'll play it,will give you very strong emotions and send shivers up to your spine.An essential purchase for all Soul/Jazz lovers!"
5,Fantastic!,"These guys really know how to perform! I've seen them in concert and their shows are incredible. Not only can they sing, but their music and dancing talents are quite impressive! They go all out and deserve five stars or more when it comes to entertainment. RPM's cd has a vast array of great pop songs that leave you wanting for more. The best part is that there is not just one or two good songs , like on most cd's, that you'll only listen to-each and every song on ""Angel"" is great. RPM's ""Angel"" cd is appropriate for all ages. The songs have everyday related meanings and pertain to positive aspects in life such as love, friendships, companionships and more. I became even more impressed when I found out that the cd was interactive and you could see them in concert on your computer! Personally, RPM has a unique style that I know many will enjoy. All it takes is a few minutes of the cd ""Angel"" and you'll be hooked!"
1,Avoid like the plague,"This screen is a marvel - outstanding colours, much better than any CRT I've owned - much better than my laptop TFT! The sounds is clear and the foot print is a fraction of a CRT. However like many others (that I've read about elsewhere on the net) its suffered the fade to black to white problem. This is a fault with the build, and appears to be receiving little input from Sony as even replacements are faulty!Buy something else, not this."
1,Sony M51 Monitor - Strange colors,"As have hundreds of other people , who purchased this monitor, I have had the strange colors, and problems , that seem to be a part of this unit, others squeeze the left lower side of it to get it going again, I flick my finger in the same location, and hit the case ,it runs again, NOT what I want to do on a regular basis !Sony will not do the right thing,big surprise .A $... rebate would have been more in line .Live and learn...."
4,Lovejoy prevails,"I love the series, sadly the television series is not out on DVD. many of the more recent stories are also hard to get and not in print in the US.It took me awhile to find this copy.The best part about Lovejoy is the antiques and Gash's profound knowledge and his artful way of weaving real history into the mix.I love the series and hope for many more to come."
3,"Great start fades into confusion, repetition","I had high hopes for this book, the first Lovejoy mystery, after enjoying the character on tv and being an antiques buff. The book drew me in right away and I really enjoyed the first third or so. Then after repetitious scenes (escape, capture, escape, capture, on and on) and the introduction of a dozen minor characters that come and go without a meaningful role or purpose, I got bored. I finished it out of determination and in the hope that there would be a wonderful denoument that would tie all together, but there was no big payoff; just a lot of preposterous happenings and vague explanations. My sense was that the author went on a cruise and put everyone he met on the cruise into a story, no matter how it all fit together.I won't give up on Gash though (Lovejoy's a great character and the writing has an enjoyable tone) and have an ealier Lovejoy mystery I'm hoping will be more like the beginning of The Ten Word Game, all the way through."
4,Good resource book,Projects and ideas are realistic. They are not handy-man projects but look finished and professionally designed. I got a good idea for a window seat from book.
1,Don't buy it,If you want to see the trim work pictures just google it so you don't have to spend your money for couple pictures.
5,New editorial review,"I'm the author of ""Totally Absurd Inventions"", by Ted VanCleave, published by Andrews McMeel. ISBN: 0740710257I have a new editorial review book description but I couldn't find a way to submit it to you correctly. So, I'm submitting it via reviews. Please post the newly updated info below.Book Description Totally Absurd Inventions offers over 100 of the funniest patents on the planet. Need to know when your baby's diaper is dirty? You'll want to see the plans behind the Diaper Alarm. Also see the dieter's Alarm Fork, the beer drinker's Keg Head and the dog lover's Ear Tubes. Most amazing of all, every one of these inventions has been issued a genuine United States patent! Each goofy gizmo features it's detailed patent illustration and a lively description for your ready pleasure.Thanks,Ted"
1,"Fine book, but not always accurate.","The author attempts to laugh on the inventions and patents. Unfortunately he is not always thorough enough in his thoughts. For example 'Do you think it is something wrong in combining babies water and electricity'. Sounds dangerous, but it is not: think about your 1.5 Volt battery try to touch skin with it : you feel nothing.Dear Mr. Vancleave! Nerve impulses themselves are 'electricity' - you should not afraid of the word itself, but try to understand the physics beyond it.Respectfuly,"
3,Forget Ink,"This worked well in my HP OfficeJet 7140 BUT ..... Ink is so yesterday (messy, dries up, expensive). I upgraded to a color laser (HP CP1520) over a 15 months ago. Still using the original toner. Especially if you have school age children, get current and go color laser."
2,HP14 Yellow Printhead,"The printhead was to be new, but my printer doesn't think so. The box arrived somewhat smashed which may have cracked the plastic and dried out the printhead. I take some responsibility for not notifying the shipper sooner to give them the opportunity to rectify the problem."
1,Hewlett Packard C4923A Yellow Printhead,Our printer keeps flashing that the printhead is bad. We have had problems with our printer since we installed the printhead. Was wondering if the printhead could have been damaged. Is it possible to have it replaced?
3,Works fine but not the same as orginal formulation,"Years ago I bought the pre-made product which lasted forever and did a beautiful job for cleaning jewelry. It works really well on diamonds and gets them to sparkle unlike anything else I have found. So when it finally ran out I was happy to find this refill concentrate here on Amazon. It is a great idea as I am all for reducing waste and being environmentally friendly. However I found the product to be less satisfying to use, it just didn't look the same. It doesn't have the consistency as the original product which seemed to cling to the jewelry better. Mixed as directed this just seems like grey-blue water. It will clean, but I think I would prefer the original formulation. This is unfortunate because it is a great idea and more cost effective to mix your own. I would still buy this again if they quit making the original because it is still a good product."
4,"Meaningful lyrics, with soothing melodies....","""So The Past Shall Pass"", mixes meaningful lyrics with soothing waves of melody. It seems obvious to the listener that this CD was written at a time of great emotional stress for the artisticly attributed Troy. This album very adequately expresses the feelings of pain, stife, love Troy wished to convey to the listener save any Morrisey like whininess. In addition, the lyrics are well painted to the melodic three piece that accompanies. The subtle breaks of song, or music, helps to let the listener comprehend what is happening, and is very relevent to this listening process. While, it is clear that this music is emotionally draining to the performer, the last song, on this album, Wake, is appropriately named, as the listener does ""wake"", from this album feeling refreshed. This album is far more than mood music, and leaves the listener with a feeling of afterglow, without needing a shower."
5,Rich Characters,"This book may be in the wrong category. I would not really place it in the action group becuase it is a display of a deep character driven novel. It is really a very interesting look at this difficult time for Russian's. It was also much more enjoyable then I thought it would be. The descriptions of the locations and main home were very good. I also liked the characters that were created. They had depth and feeling, not just scratch the surface to fill pages. The book is not the feel good hit of the year, it does had a rich plot that you need to keep up with, but the author rewards your efforts with a masterly written book. I think when it comes down to it that is the strength here, the writing is just very good, a lot of feeling comes out."
5,I love it,This was one of my favorite movies when I was little and altough I don't own it I have seen it so many times that it is embedded in by brain! It is about an old man who gets the gift of a piano from some pixies. The piano can fly when he plays it and he is supposted to be back at a certain time and he's not there and the little pixies are sort of singing a song about Pontoffel Pock and they sing the little song and he still doesn't came back so they have to go and get him. It is the best Dr. Suess movie I've seen.
2,Didn't find this book helpful,This book features a number of cliched ideas about setting and achieving goals. It did not help me to organize my needs in order to achieve the goals I set.
3,Not a bad movie... no nudity,"It has a good plot with twists and turns. Was actually a good movie worth watching again. The female start gets into some sexy outfits, but not topless or nude. Theres a long distance side boobage shot, but not great. I usually discount these old movies if there's no skin, but it was actually a good movie."
3,They have this mislabeled or mispictured,"The item is not an HD15, it is a DB15. The picture is right and the name is wrong. This is not a VGA connector, it is a MAC connector. Besides not being what I wanted, it looks great and would seem to be exactly what a person would want if one wanted what this is."
5,Works and its cheap,I bought this for my wife to take as part of her daily regiment. She had me buy this for here after reading an article on taking spirulina and chlorella for damaged skin. She loved this brand the best I have purchased this for her numerous times. She tried other store brands which she felt did not have the same effects as this for her.
4,Simple to use,"I agree with the above review, the nature sounds could be better. Alarm one is the CD (or buzzer if no CD is loaded). Alarm two is the radio. Alarm 3 is the nature sounds. If you need to set three alarms you have to use each of the modes. You can't set 3 CD alarms or 3 radio alarms, etc. Still, I like this product. It is easy to use and has a lot of features. You can set the sleep timer and listen to a CD, the radio, or the nature sounds while falling asleep. It has a bass boost and AM and FM presets to save your favorite radio stations."
2,nice display but unrealistic features,"i bought this from circuit city today because it allows 3 alarm settings and it's a cd clock radio. It was to my disappointment that I found out that the 3 alarm settings are preset to either cd/alarm, radio, or nature sound.This means if you wanted to listen to CD to sleep and wake up to the buzzer, it's impossible. In order for the buzz to work, you must not insert a cd the night before. This kind of ruined our plan since my boyfriend wanted to wake up to the buzzer and I wanted to wake up by CD.It seemed a waste for Timex to factory-program the 3rd button to the Nature Sound since the most of the nature sounded like woods animal on crack. It stressed me out listening to it. I guess I could just pretend that it's the buzzer noise by how annoying it is.I will be taking it back tomorrow."
2,"Unacceptable FM Reception, Otherwise Excellent","I was replacing a 5 year old, nearly identically-featured Timex clock radio (Model T600) because the tuner became intermittant.I liked the old model so much I just wanted the same thing and the Timex T618T / T619T seemed to be it.With the new unit and its antenna in the exact location as the old, I am able to receive only 3 strong stations where the old one got about 15-20. A strong station will interfere with all nearby ones and other stations just aren't picked up at all... very poor sensitivity and selectivity.The unit and its other features are excellent and well thought out, better than I expected even, but the tuner is atrocious."
2,"Good new, bad news","GOOD NEWS: when I threw this item at the floor, it kept on working.BAD NEWS: I threw it at the floor out of severe frustration with not being able to figure it out.The two stars are for all the very nice features. And I have not had problems with reception.GOOD:* Backup battery WITH low battery indicator (surprisingly the only one I found out there)* headphone jack in back can be plugged into a powered speaker system to allow really good cd sound.* Lots of weekend on/off flexibility (its nice once you figure it out.)* Lots of easy to use radio pre-setsBAD* The buzzer only works if there is no CD in. So - if you listen to the cd in the evening you cant use the buzzer to wake up (really stupid design.)* Difficult to learn. More importantly, getting feedback on whether the alarm is on/off requires a strange maneuver that involves actually turning it off momentarily. What?"
4,Great function and features,"Great little and compact stero with the triple alarms and nature sounds included. The only thing I was not to happy about is the AM reception. You have to turn the radio to get better reception which you shouldn't have to I feel, living in a major city."
1,Avoid,"The quality of reception on this radio was never good. The engineering of this product did not focus on the radio. This is illustrated by the antenna - a single wire that dangles down to the floor. After about 10 months, the quality gradually degenerated. It now produces mostly white noise."
2,features that don't make sense,"In addition to the previous review, here's a few more poor design features of this unit. The ""triple alarm"" feature is stupid. Alarm 1 is buzzer or CD only - Alarm 2 is CD or radio only and Alarm 3 is nature sounds only. Geez - I just want a 2 alarm CD radio that sets off one alarm at 5:15am and one again at 8:00. Also, if you have headphones plugged in - don't forget to pull out the plug from the unit before sleeping - none of the alarms will sound through the speakers, only the headphones. This unit is going back."
2,Static and mechanical noise mar a good clock radio,"I tried this one because the display on the otherwise great Aiwa FR-CD3000 was unreadable in the dark. The Timex (a clock maker) has a great display. However, the FM reception is weak. I got too much hiss, in a location the Aiwa and a very cheap radio had no hiss. Also, the startup and stopping of the CD motor was annoying, especially if you have chosen a track at the far end. Finally, there was no timed ""snooze"" when using a CD. The cd would play all the way to the end. There is a timed snooze with the radio."
1,"Horrible, horrible reception","It's pretty and reasonably user-friendly, but this is a wretched radio. It picks some signals up too much - one station bled all the way from 91.5 to 90.7. Other signals it won't pick up without holding the antenna in weird contortions, stations that my old battered clock radio can pick up without any trouble, as can any of the other radios I own. I can't comment on the rest of the features...it's getting returned immediately. Do NOT buy this if you are looking for a clock RADIO."
1,Too complex to use,"We bought this Timex for our home to test it for use in a hospitality situation. For guests, clock radios must be simple to use...they won't be able to ponder a manual.This unit is too complex to use...even with a manual. It's controls are counter-intuitive. The alarm settings are hard to see. Plus, the sound is very tinny. On the plus side, the nature sounds are nice to have.I would not purchase again."
2,"Beautiful on the outstide, HORRENDOUS in the inside!","I wanted to buy this for my daughter. I wanted to combine a traditional record book with fill-ins with my new scrapbooking hobby. The outside is precious, but once you open it, the pages are like a black and white newspaper material, and they have no structure what so ever. The pages are boring and don't look very durable."
3,"Half-good, half-rotten","Honestly, I'm satisfied with about half of this album - namely, the half that's supposed to be recorded in the Prancing Pony. It's fun, it's lighthearted, and it really does transport you to Middle Earth. Get the CD for these tracks, because unfortunately, the rest of this CD is comprised of studio tracks that take themselves too seriously for their own good. The melodies aren't bad, but the lyrics are some of the most cliched drivel I've heard in a long time... so much so that I feel embarassed to listen to it when I'm on headphones! Mirkwood was particularly painful to listen to, sounding like it was written for the kind of vision of the Elves that a toddler might have - not someone who wants something that sounds like Tolkien! At any rate, I would recommend this CD only if you don't mind spending this much money for only 6 tracks, because I garuntee that you'll want to shut it off after the Pony."
2,Arghh,"I bought this CD on the basis of all the glowing reviews here on Amazon, and the fact ive been a big LoTR fan for 30 years.1st off the singing doesnt capture the flavor of a wandering minstrel troupe, IMHO. Bleh.2nd, the mix is bad. Granted its supposed to be a ""live performance"" at the Prancing Pony, but half the time you cant even understand the words they are singing.3rd, the main instrument heard is an electric keyboard. Ive read the books several times, and to my knowledge i missed the part where the Shire had electricity. Maybe they plugged it into Gandalfs staff or something...This detracts heavily on my ""you are in Middle Earth"" experience i am supposed to be having.Dont get me wrong, i love prog, Yes/Rush/Enchant/Cairo/Dream Theater and all, and i love celtic style music like the Chieftains, Tempest, Solas and the like, but this cd by Glass Hammer dont cut it by a long shot. Maybe this should not have been my 1st purchase by them."
1,Lame,Lameat bestcan't remember when I was so bored.Hope I can get a couple bucks back for this on ebay.
3,VERY DISAPPOINTED.........,"IF YOU LIKE VOCAL MUSIC YOU WILL LIKE THIS CD. I PERSONALLY DONOT CARE FOR VOCALS. BUT I WILL SAY THIS FOR THE MUSIC, IT ISVERY INTERESTING AND IT IS THE TYPE OF SINGING YOU WOULD PROBABLY HERE AT THE INNS IN THE SHIRE, BREE, AND IN MIDDLE EARTH."
4,Young toddlers love the ponies!,"My granddaughters are totally into My Little Pony. This is one of their favorite books. They like the plastic glued on ponies and as of yet have not been able to pry them off. The board book contains about a sentence a page and they read as a rhyming poem. If your kids like My Little Pony, this is a good addition to your child's library. The illustrations on the pages also contain familar pony images which of course is an immediate hit with the kids that like the ponies. There is enough in the illustrations to chat with your child about the scene. The plastic ponies are useful for teaching colors and introducing counting."
3,Pas mal,C'est le seul livre que j'ai trouvé donnant en détails les méthodes pour créer des cartes de contrle dans MS Excel. Le livre se fait cependant un peu vieux et on trouve aujourd'hui plus complet et ce gratuitement sur le web en fouillant un peu.
5,Fine Finish,"Shipwreck of their Hopes is a fine finish to this very important trilogy about the key Battles in the West. While it ""suffers"" from the same flaws as the first two books, and does require that one actually use ones brain when reading, it more than makes up for these ""flaws"" by the very high level of detail.The three books, when put together, are a comprehensive history and a definite read for anyone who wants to be able to understand the Civil War."
4,COZZEN'S CHATTANOOGA,"Another masterfully written account on the military operations of the Army of the Cumberland immediately following the withdrawal and defeat upon the fields at Chickamauga. Cozzens vividly describes the struggles of the Army of the Cumberland from starving and surrounded to being well supplied and victorious upon the ridges and hills around Chattanooga. The details of his historical research will lead your mind to capture the brutal images of yet another epic chapter in America's Great Civil War. A wonderfully detailed chronicle of the Civil War West as fought upon the grounds about Chattanooga, Tennessee."
3,A good readable book,"This is a good account of the battle and events leading up to it. Peter Cozzens is not the best writter but he is able to do an above average job. The 3 books, taken as a group give a good account of the battles but not a very readable one.To enjoy these books, you need an intrest in the army and/or battle! They are not bad books just hard to read."
1,Never Received Product I Ordered,"I never received this product from Amazon because they incompetently sent the item back before delivering it to my long standing address (to which they have delivered many items). Their customer service people couldn't give me an answer why this happened. Again, I call that Incompetence with a capital ""I""."
4,War Paint,"Robert Stack is a cavalry officer with a patrol en-tasked with a vital Mission to get a copy ot the Peace treaty to the Indian Chief before a war breaks out. He faces not only problems with his men but has to fight a group of Indians that want a war. He ends up alone but for an Indian girl , who he finally convinces to help him."
5,Brunton MNS User Manual On Tape,The Brunton MNS Instructional Video is essentially a user manual for the Brunton GPS receiver. It makes it easier to understand what the instruction manual says in one sentence when you can see someone actually doing it and explaining what they are doing and why. There are some practical examples included to help you to better understand what you were just shown in the instructions. This is my second video from GPS Outfitters and I have found both of them to be concise and would recommend them to anyone new to GPS.
5,Definitely works,"The item definitely works and is very helpful with its ease of use. Definitely better than a razor or, god forbid, waxing. Give it a shot, you can't go wrong."
2,nothng special,"Didnt think this product was anything special. I had a 10$ hair shaver that I used to use. The description of this item made it seem way better. Come with 3 preset length, but I found i didnt want either of those lengths so I was out of luck. Would be worth it for a third of the price"
2,gone.,"It works okay for removing hair completly, but the different ""heads"" for it, don't seem to work at all. This thing works for all or nothing, but not in between."
2,doesn't live up to expectations,"I've been shaving my body hair for years using a traditional hair trimmer. I was excited to see a product that was specifically designed for this purpose and it seemed like it'd be easy to use - and I liked that it was cordless.Once it was charged up I found that it couldn't trim my body hair well with any of the supplied attachments - and I'm not even very hairy. I'd have to go over the same spot again and again to get all the hairs to the same length.It did a fine job when I wanted an area shaved bald - not as close as a blade shaver but good enough. Unfortunately, except for certain sensitive areas, mostly I like my body hair clipped rather than shaved. For this I still need to go back to the old hair clipper.Bummed since I really wanted this product to work for everything."
2,"Good itea, but item needs work.","I will start off by saying that the marketing for this item is pretty amazing. But sadly, despite the marketing ideas, I was let down by the qualtiy and ease of use of this product. This product does work and does do what it says it does, but it takes too much time and fidgeting to get it to work right. The idea of 3 guards is great, but for hairy people, you have to wash the guard way too much. I could go about 6-12 inches before having to stop and rinse the hair out of the guard. This made the process painfully slow. The guards are a great idea, but there is really no release for them from the razor. Everytime I wanted to change guards, I had to pull the head off of the razor and felt as if I was going to break it. The razor has a solid body, but the head of it feels somewhat cheap. I returned mine after one use. I would still say try this item and simply return it if you don't like it."
1,worsed shaver ive ever purchased.,"1. Outta the box i was thinkin alright. Cool design. NOT. Constantly flipping and turning to trim spots. 2. Trimming in itself was a painful hair pulling(literally) experience. With every swipe, attachment or not, this thing was pullin my hair out. 7-10 swipes to get down to stubble in one spot....come on. Ridiculous. 3. The razor will nick ...oh yes it will.. 4. After 24 hrs of charging, the battery started crappin out after 20 mns...yes it was taking me 20 mns to shave what would normally take 5-10....not impressed and on my way to the store to return it after first use. So buyer beware!!!!!! Unless u like little nicks and pain.and now that i think about it, im taking away the one measely star i without thinking gave this sad excuse of a razor/trimmer. BOGUS."
1,Money making scam... read on to find out why.,"After only two months of regular use, the foil broke. And guess what's the only element NOT covered by warranty!!!! And guess what costs nearly as much as the device itself!! Thats right, the bloody weak-ass foil!!!!"
3,"Great if you want smooth skin, but...","This trimmer is great if you want to shave down to smooth skin, but the trimmer attachments are quite ineffective. (For example, trimming hair down to a uniform quarter or half inch.) The attachments don't do a good job of guiding hair into the actual cutters so you have to make many passes to get all the hair. Even then, the remaining hair isn't an even length. If you want uniformly trimmed hair, you're better off with traditional clippers like the Wahl 9627 (just one example). And watch out -- without the attachments, the Bodygroom has been known to bite in tight areas! But if you want smooth skin without using a razor, this is the device for you."
2,Broke after being dropped,"I'd go for the Philips Norelco BG2030 Norelco BodyGroom Plus instead. It's far more durable by comparison. The blades seem to do a better job at shaving, not plucking and nicking. I'd give that one a 4/5 because it's not perfect."
3,Ni tan buena,Es probable que consigas un mejor producto al mismo precio...La cuchilla no deja el pelo tan al ras.La duración de la batería si es aceptable. Dura al menos 3 afeitadas completas.
5,AWESOME PRODUCT!!!!,"Just got the Shaver Groom in the mail for a friend of mine, Its his 27th birthday...He LOVES it!!! He used it ""Down There"" today and said it didnt cut him, it was SUPER fast! and there was no itching feeling. He loves the shaver! ""I cant believe how fast it was, cut shaving time & clean up time dramatically!"" he said..My friend shaved his under arms & public area today with it for the first time....He said ""Every guy should have one! I cant wait till my next shower to shave again, he says....If smooth is what you like, then the body groom is for you! Any negative comments about the product means the people didnt read the instuction manual that comes along with the product...Added plus is that the shaver gets rid of dead skin that grows out when pubic hair grows out and Soft skin & No hair ""Down There"" is all that is left...""I feel like Im 10 years old again!"" 10+++++ Product!""....Thanks for giving my friend a great birthday present!!! You guys are awesome!!!!"
3,It does the job,"I bought the product for it's reviews. I used to use a whal hair trimmer, and I lost it. I decided to purchase this to get me by. All I can say is that I don't reccommend this product due to it pulling hairs and not giving a clean cut. I'm curious as to why other people gave it good reviews. It might just be me."
4,Great item,"My wife and I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for our 20 year old son. He loves it. It's easy to use and except for the fact that the removable blade guides are a bit tough to get off the shaver...it works like a champ.As the generation of ""hairless is better""...from the ""other generation""..it's a keeper. Reasonably priced and easy to use. A great gift for that teen/twentysomething that has everything!"
4,Great body groomer,This body groomer works well in either dry or wet conditions. I keep mine in the shower and use it wet. I can use it on sensitive parts of my body and not become irritated or pinched as with some other body groomers.This is a wothwhile product if you have the need?
2,Not Impressive,"When I first recieved this product it looked promising, but once I took it for a test drive I was disappointed. The Bodygroom worked well on the arms so I took it to the chest and the result was a lot of going over one area over and over. By the time the hair on my chest was shaved my skin was cursing me with irritation. When I tried the bodygroom on the groin area it was the same result. My personal opionion is just wax!"
3,Bodygroom,Thought for the price it was a very good choice for me. I don't have a ton of body hair so it worked well. Now and again you have to turn off the razor and clean out the hair that gets jammed-up under the clippers but other than that a good product for the price.
1,I'd rate it 0 stars if I could.,"I noticed a plethora of raves for this product. I personally don't get it. I enjoy, and have reviewed positively, nearly every product I've purchased on Amazon. This one is truly inferior. I was excited by the concept. It works to an extent, but there are hundreds of products out there that do the same tasks and do it better. In addition, you take your future offspring in your hands if you are foolish enough to groom in areas where one does not speak. One user describes the ""chunk"" taken out. He knows of what he speaks. Your option. I bought it, I used it a few times, found it to be a dangerous, poorly functioning and poorly designed product and now it collects dust. Can't seem to throw it out due to the cost. Perhaps I can groom my dog with it :) ."
1,Doesn't work well,For me the head would keep getting caught and pull off in the shower and it just cuts VERY slowly...be prepared to go over the same area 10 times in a row before it actually gets the job done. I'm sending it back with a letter complaining to PhilipsNorelco
1,Does not work as it claims to.,"Very poor shaving instrument, takes multiple passes and still does a bad job. Very disappointed. I have an older Wahl trimmer that does a much better job. This one will be packed away for desperate times."
1,Piece of junk,"I have to agree with the negative reviews, it doesn't shave well dry and I'm not that hairy. On the other hand it doesn't shave ANYTHING when wet, which again wouldn't matter if this thing actually did the job when dry. Finally, the battery is so weak that after less than a year the thing no longer holds a charge, so fully charged it tries to shave for about 3 minutes and then dies out. This thing was obviously cheaply made, they spent their money on marketing not on the product itself."
2,Ehhh,Bought this for my boyfriend. I thought it would be good since he could use it in the shower. Apparenlty its not that great. He only used it once and then ended up buying something else.
4,"When the pieces stay together, does a good job - combs dont work","Buyer be careful! This product does a great job when all the components stay together. Swipe it once (say, to remove water) and it falls apart easily . Getting a replacement for broken parts isn't easy. The combs really don't work, unless maybe you have really long hair a few cms long. Otherwise, you end up pressing really hard and still come away disappointed. Its either shave really clean (which it does well) or nothing - nothing in between.All said, if you're careful and know what you're doing, this one's pretty smooth at what it does and leaves the skin smooth."
4,"Not perfect, but can there be...","As promised, this works well and is probably as safe as one can be and still do the job. I would still advise to be cafeful because it can cut if you get careless. As long as you are careful it works wonders and is made well in my opinion.Try it, after all she needs to be the judge, not you."
1,Dulls quickly,First couple uses were great.Dulled incredibly quickly and resulted in pulling out hair...and in certain areas this is not fun at all...pretty much won't cut anything now.
2,Didn't last very long,"Pretty disappointed with this product as the shaver portion (the part you can take out and clean) did not stay in place after a few months. For the first few months it was great. When it started to get stuck IN my hair (detached and stuck there) when I was shaving, I stopped using it. Either don't waste your money or don't take out the top to clean it."
5,Fantastic!,"Got this as an anniversary present from my wife. Used it on my ""private"" areas. She loved the after effects and played with ""it"" whole night long!Just be careful on the first go, as it did pinch me once - ""ouch"" otherwise it does the job quite safely as long as you're gentle with it. One point I'de like to note is that it does not give you a very close shave like a razor would."
1,Very Bad Trimmer,"Gets clogged by long hairs, Blue spacers won't come off easily. Battery life isn't that good."
1,What a piece of junk!,"I don't know where to begin. When you take the plastic clip guards off, they take the entire head off of the device where you have to snap it back on. Then when actually trimming, the device either shaves hair and skin off in chunks if the guards aren't on, or doesn't trim any hair at all if they are on. I can't believe how much this junk snags on skin."
1,Terrible...an instrument of torture...,"The fine metal mesh that sits on top of the moving blades, got immediately caught in between, broke and start cutting skin like hell. Ordered another mesh for 12$ (warranty did not cover it). Then, same problem again - mesh moves when it should not, gets caught in the blades, brakes, and then it is your SKIN - NOT HAIR - gets cut.OUCH ! TERRIBLE ! PAINFUL ! Literally - a BLOODY product. If you're into serious masochism - this is the product that will make your day. Otherwise - buy something else."
2,Nothing Special,I can't say this is a very effective piece of equipment. I bought it all excited that it would speed the process up. It does the reverse. In order for use you need to first trim everything down to a lower level typically using a beard grommer. Then you can use this tool but if you want to get a little closer you'll need a straight edge razor. Your better off just buying a beard grommer and razor. This is fairly worthless piece of equipment.
1,What an incredible disappointment,"I should have sensed trouble when, during the opening of the packaging, the thick plastic cut me. I charged the thing fully, then proceeded to experience the pain of my chest hair being tugged out. During a more tentative attempt to shave some armpit hair the entire shaving head popped off in the shower. Nice. Needless to say I did not tempt trimming anything more precious. This baby will be back to Norelco in the morning."
1,rediculous!!!,I thought it would actually work well since i see all those good reviews but i guess its all a gimmick... i was better off with the razors i shave with my face.. the shaver is way over priced for what it can do...go to a local target and get yourself a razor for $7.00 like a gilette with fusion..that will work fine..please stay away from this product and save yourself $40.00...
2,Can't use on head or beard....spotty on back,"I bought this thinking I'd have a good all-around shaver and it certainly wasn't that. It can't do much more than a centimeter's worth of hair length on your head before it starts bunching up and cutting nothing. The plastic guards are a pain to put on and take off, are inconsistent and frequently PULL the hair straight out of your beard.....not pleasant. The hair on my back is rather fine and stays pretty close to the skin and the shaver did little to get it all.I guess I shouldn't have expected as much as I did but with a name like ""Bodygroom"", I would think it would work on more of your body. I can't even imagine how angry I'd be if I had used those crummy, hair pulling guards below the belt."
4,Ouchless,"Pros:This shaver did a fantastic job on some certain sensitive areas! It easily did a really good job where I just wouldn't trust another shaver. Really close, and super smooth. I like how it holds like a razor, it makes it easy to maneuver. It's totally waterproof so I can use it in the shower, and the rechargeable battery is convenient and lasts well. I'm also happy that replacement heads are available.Cons:The 3 attachments on this unit are almost useless. Trying to get through my chest hair was a slow process. I eventually used another trimmer to shorten it. This shaver is pretty much only good at getting the REALLY sensitive areas that you want to be smooth.Another minor thing is that the shaver has no LED to indicate that it is properly charging or finished charging. If you don't push it securely down into the charger, you might find yourself with a dead battery and a laughing wife."
2,"Okay, but be careful!","Purchased this after reading several reviews of it. It `works', however I found that one has to be extremely careful with it when using it in those `sensitive areas'!This shaver does have side trimmers, and at both the top and bottom of the main shaver foil, that automatically engage whenever the shaver is turned on, which `will' catch skin, and give you some nasty nicks and cuts!With my Braun shaver, I have the option to pop up and engage a side trimmer, if needed. It would have been nice if there was some way to disengage the side trimmers on this Philips Norelco shaver to avoid those nasty nicks and cuts, especially in tight, sensitive areas.As far as the actual shave itself, I found it to be not really any comparably closer than my cheap Braun, everyday facial shaver.Still a good shaver for the price, just watch out for those top and bottom trimmers! OUCH!"
2,Not so great,"It works, but the detachable head always gets caught on your hair and pulls out. I would have saved a lot of time and money using some shaving cream and a razor."
5,Caution: May cause hairlessness,"Forget old fashion clippers. I bought the BODYGROOM for my privates and before I knew it my chest and legs where hairless. If you ever knicked your sack with clippers, get a BODYGROOM and you will soon be fearless. Try it with a friend and make play out of chore."
4,Awesome Bodygroomer,I really like this shaver. I only give it a 4 star cause it doesn't get razor close. But i haven't had any bumps or razor burn what so ever. I use it to shave from my chest down to my feet. Very easy to maintain your bodygrooming. Way easier then shaving with razor and shaving cream.
3,Overall a step up from razors.,"It's quicker at removing body hair than a standard razor. It's still possible to nick yourself in the process, and doesn't remove pubic hair anywhere near as well as the advertisements suggest. It could also benifit from a great vareity of comb lengths."
2,is it possible to replace the battery in this?,is it possible to replace the battery in this? i would hate to have to dispose of it after the battery no longer holds a charge.
3,"Ehhhh, not the greatest","Not the greatest, but it does a decent job. Horrible when wet. Easy to clean."
2,Maybe it's just me but...,"...This thing barely works. I don't know if the battery is faulty, but I charged it before initial use. When I turned it on, it made alot of noise first off. You'd think with all the technology, you'd be able to make a razor that was more quiet. Again, maybe it was the battery because it started crapping out after 5 minutes of use. It was a painful 5 minutes too, because I tested it on some safe parts of my body. Well, it tugged and pulled instead of cutting. I thought, maybe the hairs are too long? Although this shouldn't be an issue with a razor of this acclaimed magnitude. So I went ""down below"" because those hairs are already short. I averted any pain, but this thing did me no favors. I haven't bothered with it again. Based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but again, perhaps it was an isolated incident. I gave it 1 star above the minimum because it looks cool. Good luck to anyone else."
2,Not as good for the job as the ads would have you believe,"I found that basic hair trimmers work better. The first tme I used this I cut myself. Although the ads would have you believe that this product is perfectly suited for the job, I believe that a standard razor, shaving cream, and a touchup with an electric hair trimmer still works best."
2,"Poor quality, not worth the money","I had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed. A fully-charged battery lasts 50 minutes which is not enough time for a guy like me who's only moderately hairy. It takes many, many times of shaving over a spot to get the hair neatly trimmed, and even then sometimes it just won't work. As far as shaving (as opposed to trimming) the groin area safely, it doesn't work very well and the exposed cutting edges at both sides of the foil can cut if you're not careful.The Norelco Accuvac, which Amazon sells for the same price, is much sturdier and trims body hair much faster and more neatly; it has 9 settings which are changed by turning a dial, as opposed to the cumbersome and hard-to-change 3 plastic attachments that come with the Bodygroom. As far as shaving the groin area, trim with the Accuvac and then use a new style razor such as the Gillette M3 Power or Venus Vibrance; they give a much closer shave and are almost impossible to cut your privates with!"
1,Useless if you actually have hair,"Let me first start off by saying that I am a hairy guy. Not a little bit, but pretty much all over. And it's not a lightweight coating. If your like me this product isn't for you. It does work in the shower, but falls apart easily, gets clogged, the guards snap on and when pulling them off it at times it will pull the actual head of the clippers apart. I also try to go for that 'unshaven' look and this is completely useless for any sort of facial trimming. Yes, you can shave your sack, and yes, it will nick you if you aren't totally careful, but I really cant justify owning a shaver for just that purpose. I have typically used a 'pro' set of clippers (the kind they shave your head with) and those are far superior to this, even the cheapest pair of them have outlasted and outperformed this product. I think this lasted a week and a half before I tossed it."
3,Only good for sensitive skin...moderately reliable,"This product started with high expectations because razors did not work well with my skin type-- causing ingrown and uneven hair growth.So, I bought this product to help retain a higher standard of hygiene and cleanliness of lines because I have sensitive skin with sporadic hair growth. On numerous occassions the shaver has nicked my ""shaft"" which was incredibly painful. I understand that the newer model addresses this issue quite well with its ""extra sensitive' attachment. So it loses one star for the nicking...The other star lost (down to 3) is due to durability- this devices isn't terribly durable. I have had it replaced once in 1 year of ownership due to the power button malfunctioning. The service reps at Phillips were helpful but I recently replaced a sonicare and the service was terrible...so be careful."
2,Could be a lot better.,"There are two major flaws with this product. First, the shaver requires an enormous 8-hour charge for a measly 50 minutes of use. Not only is this not efficient it's also inconvenient. The only time I am at home for that long is when I am sleeping. The fact that the batteries lifespan is reduced from overcharging does not help this flaw. Second, all the attachments trap the hair in them and clog up. This means in order to shave your body you have to constantly push out the trapped hair. All in all, I would like to see a higher quality product for more money. As it is you're better off buying a nice Wahl beard trimmer."
1,The hubby's hates it,"My husband did not like this at all. It's not good for chest hair & definitely not safe to use in your private area,"
2,Bad charger for this shaver,"As good as this shaver works, I wish philips had taken similar effort in making good chargers for this product. I had to replace the first one I bought since the charger blew out the moment I plugged in to the AC outlet in my home. I don't have issues with any other chargers for any of my other devices. Recently the replacement charger also blew up and not working any more."
2,Good shaver,I have not used it much. But from whatever little I have used it seems to server its purpose at a low price
1,Broke/Faulty product,I have had this product for about 3 months and used it three times. Initially was satisfied with the results except that it pulls hair instead of cutting at times. The third time I used it after a full charge the shaver would turn off when turned upside down. It felt like it had no power and totally started to rip the hair off of my chest. I went to return the product and you only have a month to do so. Very disappointed in Amazon and this product. DO NOT BUY!
3,On / Off switch breaks,"I've purchased 3 of these razors in the past several years. They do a great trim job, so I have no issues with that. my 3 star rating is due to the fact that every single one of these I've owned has developed a problem with the on/off switch. After about a year of usage, the power button feels like it has been sucked into the body of the razor and within a few weeks of that happening, the on/off switch completely fails to work. On 2 of these, the power button failed while the razor was on...thus, I could not turn it off and had to let it run itself out."
2,Very poor flimsy product.,"This product broke irreversibly in a matter of a few months. When I gave it a poor review on the Philip's site, the company rejected my review, but emailed me a link to repost. That link was a blind link. This was a poor product from a deceitful company. I will never buy from Philips again. Caveat emptor."
1,"Terrible, do not buy","Warning: DO NOT BUY THIS THING.This trimmer is terrible. It goes dull almost immediately and neither the behind the mesh razors nor the side blades will cut anything. It immediately snags on hair and won't cut. If you move very slowly back and forth against the same area, you might eventually get about 1/4"" cut after 20 seconds.I should work well, but what good is it if the blades can't stand up to use and it can't cut hair after a month? What a waste of money."
3,"Decent, but dead in under a year","The shaver worked fine for about 7-8 months. Then the button started sticking and I wasn't able to shut the thing off. After a week of magically working again, then thing no longer turns on.The shaver trimmed/groomed okay, but there would be instances of hair pullage, which was a bit painful. All-in-all, it's a decent product."
3,"Great item, lasted 3 years, then irreparably broke","It gets everything done without any pain or discomfort. That said, it broke down completely (stopped working) in 3 years of moderate use."
1,"Works okay, until switch breaks","Worked fine for a while - used it occasionally for past 2 years or so. This morning the switch broke, so it was stuck in the depressed ""on"" position and could not be turned off. The item is just made too cheaply - I don't expect a $40 item to be a throw-away after maybe 20-30 uses."
1,I hate this thing!,"I can't understand all the positive reviews. Maybe for the very hairy guys with a lot of chest hair this thing works, but for the rest I have not found one purpose a Mach 3 Gilette regular razor cant do. Especially in the crotch area, I find this thing dangerous, and essential spots down there that many men want to be smooth, well you simply cant use it there.A waste of money, i think!"
1,Junk,"I used it twice and threw it away. I guess once you've used Braun, nothing else will suffice. Proven once again, you get what you pay for."
3,It's All Right...,"I was a little disappointed by this razor. The build quality is excellent and it does help shave off everything everywhere, but I would hardly call it safe down below. I shave down there with a regular razor all the time and never had a problem, but I always cut myself with this thing. I won't let it anywhere near now. If you want to be completely hairless, just get a razor (womens seem to work best). If you just need to keep things clean and trim then this is gold."
2,Almost a good shaver,"They missed the mark on this one. It tends to dig in no matter which way you go. You have to hold it almost perfectly flat. If you do that, it will shave fairly close but my opinion is that the Braun is a much better device."
1,Not worth the time,"This unit leaves stubble, lots. The two exposed cutters are difficult to work with when trying to leave hair uncut. There is no safe side to cut with. You can't leave it plugged in all the time they recommend that you let it run down before charging and only leave it plugged in long enough to charge.Mine unit could have been defective but it never worked well from the start.My Micro Screen Remington face shaver does a much better job. Has a selectable trimmer on one side. Leaves no stubble and doesn't take bites of skin unless one is really trying to get some."
4,Well worth it!,"This one does what it is supposed to. There are moments when I think it could shave a little better, but then it's great value for price so I can't complain too much."
2,"Works as advertised, once. Then it's trash.",Does what it says it will do. The guards are a little difficult to get on and off. The head seems to fall apart easily. Seems like the materials it's made of could be a little better. Especially for the price. But it got the job done.Update: Went to charge it up. Left it on the charger for over 24 hours. The thing barely turns on. Cleaned the contacts and charged for another 24 hours. No change. Still dead. It's in the trash now.
1,"Only works for a few months, and does not have garanty!!","Only works for about 2 months and them stops working, first I tought it was the battery, but I was not. I writte to phillips to find a service provider and they never answer my emails!!! I lost my money!!!! DONT BUY THIS!!!!!! IT SUCKS!!!! PHILLIPS IS NOT A RESPONSABLE COMPANY!!!!!!!"
1,It sucks!,I bought this product thinking it would work well but it doen't. It doesn't cut hair close and it doesn't cut hair when wet like it says it does. If I could take it back I would. I'm not a very hairy guy either. I take image how poorly it would work on someone really hairy. Use a razor instead. Disapointed!
1,"& the 'Worst Trimmer for Men"" award goes to.....","You guessed it right......This one is the worst trimmer i've ever used, not only it does a horrible job at trimming but its also very fragile. Mine broke the first day of use, i went back to my cheap old norelco T770 & am very happy with it."
2,Its ok,"It has a bad habit of pulling hairs. I found that one must go painfully slow to try and prevent that from happening. Also have trouble fitting the attachments on but more so, off."
2,Pros and Cons,"I used this product for over a year, so am well familiar with its ins and outs.On the good end, it shaves well and cleanly without the attachments. The precision blade works well for general shaping and the foil is effective for cleaning up.On the bad end, the attachments don't work well. Hair collects in them easily and prevents further effective shaving. The hair is hard to remove without taking off the attachment. Also, note how the blades are positioned on both sides of the foil; it makes it very hard to use the foil on sensitive regions without nicking oneself with the blades. Finally, I tried using this once and only once in the shower. The razor stopped working the next day. RIP.For shaving one's own back hair, it's too hard to reach with this; try the Mangroomer (as silly as the name may be, it's a good product)! For other shaving, I've replaced this with a Wahl 9953 and hope for better results."
4,Works well,"My wife and I both use this groomer and it works well. You still need to be careful not to nick yourself, but for the most part it is safe and effective."
4,Good product but pricy,"A good utility product which does it's job but pricy. Should be 10 bucks less than what sold for. If you use it regularly be careful for the foil replacement, which is expensive."
2,Doesn't Last,"Bought this a while ago. It never did work great but I managed to get by with it for some time. However, the battery life was awful. I would charge completely. Use it once. Go to use it 3 or 4 days later and it would be totally dead. Now it wont turn on at all. I would never buy again."
5,Great Shaver,"This is one top shaver for the body. I have experienced no pulling anywhere. It is totally safe on anypart of the body, with a clean close shave or trim. You can't go wrong with it."
4,Where's the handle?,"I'm hairy front & back..shave the back once in awhile for novelty. Tried the jewels as well. Can be painful down there if not careful, and one has to be a contortionist with hands/mirrors to completely shave the back, but finally accomplished same. It definitely needs a handle of sorts to get the back done, and that's my biggest beef with this item. Guess I'll have 5 oclock shadow/crew cut on the back as I'm not doing this but a few times/yr."
1,VERY disappointed- Not even up for the simplest task,"Either I got a flawed one, or this shaver plain stinks.. I tried it on my legs and it was like I hadn't even shaved. I don't have super coarse leg hair, nor do I have overly-soft hair. At first I thought I was using it wrong, but after going over the same area multiple times, holding the shaver at all different angles, I gave up and went back to my regular shaver and shaving cream.Nice concept, and it would have been great if my husband and I could have used it for multiple 'areas' but this is being returned immediately."
2,Didnt really work for me,"I bought this because it was made for the body, but I don't know of I have weird hair. It did not shave my body well at all I ended up getting a different razor."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"This groomer really struggles with the thick stuff. I have to use another clipper to get the thick stuff, and then I can use this one to get real close. The two sided clipper can really make things tricky if you know what I mean. I would recommend trying something else."
3,Liked it ok while I had it; not sad to see it go,"Bought this online in spring 2009, and it lasted until about Aug-Sep 2010...didn't like it enough to return or replace. I used it about every month or two during that time, and was mostly happy with it throughout. Without the attachment combs, this razor works well for very short or light hair. I used it in the shower once or twice, with so-so results as far as cutting hair consistently. With the attachments, longer hair gets caught between the razor and the comb and has to be brushed out every few minutes, which was pretty annoying. It also tended to pull with the combs on, which was not cool. When it finally gave up the ghost, its death was because the razor screen tore. Not sure what it caught on or how it happened, but once the screen ripped, the jagged metal edge stuck out so I had to stop using it and never bothered to get a new screen. Replaced it by using a regular electric clipper, which cuts longer hair better and more consistently."
2,guards are useless,"Does not work on long hair at all. Guard gets clogged very easily. Also, the head assembly falls to pieces very easily when changing the guards. The 1 -2 star reviews are way more accurate than then 4 and 5's."
4,I love it,"I've used the Norelco Bodygroom for over a year now. Although there have been a few very minor nicks and scrapes, I feel that, on the whole, it a very good shaver."
1,Razor Good / Foils Bad,"I know the title can be a little confusing so let me explain. The motor on the razor is really good and the razor itself is very ergonomical. And its great that its waterproof.Now the bad. The replaceable razor foils are cheap and very poorly engineered. I have had several break on me and actually scratch my skin. The foils will sometimes push down inside the little plastic piece that holds them together. Once they ever bend a little like that they are useless. I have actually messed up a foil taking off the guard before...ugh! They arent cheap either, about $10 a piece.If they made some better foils this would be great but the foils just ruin it for me."
5,Ladies like it too!,"Wow - I'm impressed! I'm an exotic dancer, so I need to shave everything within 24 hours... which we know is no easy task. I tried this baby last night before work and I LOVE IT! It's the closest electric shaver I've ever tried. I was left with no razor burn and nice smooth skin. After getting out of my bath, I just put oil on. Once it's dry, put a little solid deodorant in the places you chafe and get irritation. It sounds crazy, but for some reason, it works!"
5,Excellent,A great product. I am very happy with my purchase. recommended highly for those looking for a low cost pubic shaver.
2,way to time consuming to get a close shave,"I was very excited about getting this product after reading several positive reviews. I was, however, very disappointed after several unsuccessful uses. The trimmer works fine, but the shaving process is near impossible to do in a time efficient manner. It only gets a close shave against the grain (which would be fine but if you don't go against the grain it hardly gets anything done). It also takes way too many strokes to get a close shave in one spot and this leads to irritation post shave.After spending a half an hour in the shower I was able to get a close shave on the abs (skin irritation included), but the contours of my chest were near impossible for this thing to properly shave.After all the reviews of how easy this thing is to use I am curious if I got defective one or if there is something I'm missing about how to use it, but all in all, this product has not done what it is supposed to for me."
2,"Liked The Idea, But....","The great thing about this body groomer is that it's waterproof and stays charged for nearly an hour. That's about it, though. Whether my hair was wet or dry, I just didn't have much luck. Any part of your body that you shave, you'll have to go over it again and again. I'm not the hairiest boy alive but by the time I spent 50 minutes with it, I could have gotten a closer shave with a Gillette Mach 3 or any other 3 bladed razor. I haven't tried the BG2030 model yet, but it has to be an improvement over this one. Overall, it's a great concept but a flawed product."
3,Great While It Worked... But Built A Bit Flimsy,"I owned the Bodygroom for about a year, and would rank its performance as pretty good. However, I found the construction a little flimsy. It would often come apart, and it is a bit difficult to reconstruct a shaver in the shower. Finally, it just gave up. I liked the idea and basic design, but will probably replace with a better-made unit."
2,Very Disappointing,"I suppose this product is convenient, and adequate if shaving/trimming very small areas, but larger areas like the chest, shoulders, etc., are incredibly slow. A cheap, corded hair trimmer does just as well in half the time (or less!)."
3,A Little disappointed,"Although the product is sleek and nice to look at. Theh attachments are hard to get on and off, and it doensn't do a great job in trimming close."
4,"Good, But Could Be Improved","I bought this a while ago and have been using it to keep myself trimmed. I like the small size and the combination razer/shaver aspect.However, I have a couple of complaints:1. There is no way to gauge the charge level of the battery. The stand also doesn't come with a charge indicator. The only one is on the AC adapter and it only lights up to show that the circuit is complete.2. The attachments are really difficult to remove from the shaver head. They are also a little pointier than I think necessary. I've jabbed myself in the arm more than once when using this.3. They really should include some sort of carrying case to keep all of the loose parts together.Other than that, I have been quite satisfied with my purchase."
2,Not so true with what they described...,"Well, the only problem i have with this trimmer is that it does not give you ""Ultra Close"" shave. I can get a closer shave with my razor than this. So that will be my only little complain."
2,Gets clogged and breaks,"This shaver works for a couple of months, but eventually gets clogged up and starts pulling hair rather than cutting it. On mine, the foil part at the top got dislodged at an angle. We replaced it with something more expensive but higher quality."
3,Not worth the price,"This shaver would be great if it cost less, for what it does I could use the one I have. Don't use it that often so I can't say how long it will last."
2,Great shaver but doesn't last!,"After only a 2 dozen or so uses, the battery is dead or the switch has failed. I understand this cannot be fixed. I have a regular Norelco razor which is several years old with a dead battery but I can still use it with it plugged in.This razor is very good for tough beards but if I have to buy a new razor every few months, then it's clear not worth it."
1,Painfull....Plain and Simple,"It is very rare I find a product that I so strongly dislike and well this is it. I purchased this product a few years back and found that although it was crafted cleverly to appeal on the eye and look good it was far from that. I found that simply cutting long body hairs in simple places became a choir for this groomer or it just painfully pulled hair right out. This often caused the head of the trimmer to fill up or even pop off. Regardless, I purchased this product to remove hair from the back and neck and well after about 6 uses too many this product became a resident of my garbage can. If you have thick hair or pain sensories in your skin...avoid using this product and pick up a Remington or a regular Conair hair trimmer to get the job done."
1,Junk - Please Read,"I was not one of the ""lucky"" guys who got a good one. Mine was junk. Head kept popping off, Blades did not align properly causing snagged painful pulling. Was attracted tothe Norelco name but now would go with ANY other brand due to my experience. Threw it out after three tries."
1,What a Waste of Time and Money,"as a serious cyclist and weight trainer i've been shaving pretty comprehensively for years; i got tired of having to be in the shower or tub, so i thought i'd try the body groomer but .... i've never been able to use it; it's never worked at all for me ..... the foil is so fragile as to be useless and now the motor will not drive the cutter head .... sigh ...... back to the tub with a safety razor ....."
2,Nice...but not perfected yet,"Trimmer still catches skin in those 'highly sensitive' areas. I was left with irritated skin that took a day to heal. The shave head does not shave closely AT ALL. I was still left with stubble on my chest and stomach. Up close, there is VERY visible hair that looks like you took a trimmer and shaved.I used this tool once and since have been using my Gillette triple blade razor every other day with a between trim with my Braun Synchro. Both of which produce a much cleaner look with no stubble and less irritation than this product. I am keeping it for trimming other parts."
3,"Close shave Good, Long hair shave bad.","If you try to shave with the hair guards on it does not do a good job, but if you take the guard off and want a close shave it does very well."
3,"Just OK, has trouble with some body hair.",Not really impressed with this trimmer. Have to do alot of passes over same spots and it has trouble with leg hair. Very good on sensitive areas though...
3,"junk...despite what the stars above say, I give it no stars","Blue trimmer attachments keep falling off. Flimsy little plastic pieces hold them on, and once they wear down ....POP!! they fall off...oh yeah and if you leave the shaver in the cradle for more than 8 hours during charging, the battery won't last you 3 months....garbage!!"
2,Its ok.,"This product is ok if you do not want a close shave. Using a manual razor is better on all other areas. It left much stuble on the legs, this is the area that I shave the most because I cycle a lot. If you don't need a close shave buy it but if you want a clean stuble free area use a manual razor. Also just using a normal electric razor designed for your face works really well."
1,This thing is a terrible product,"I am severely dissappointed. The Bodygroom shaver is a complete waste of money as far as I'm concerned. At first, it seemed to work nicely for shaving longer hair using the blue attachments, but after just a few uses it can barely cut anything. I don't know if the blades got dull or what, but it doesn't cut now. As far as using it to shave without the attachments, don't do it !! You're better off using a rusty razor blade. This product yanks out stubble by the root and cuts your skin. I actually bled from it."
2,very nice for most types of hair,"The foil is a bit misleading, because if you are shaving parts of your body with many curves (under the zipper) the timmer will catch you and it hurts, a lot. The foil can ONLY be used on straight surfaces. The two trimmer blases rest at about a 200degree angle. If you have to many curves to mow with the foil without hitting the trimmer.... well, be prepared to spend a night or two on the sofa!"
2,if you like to spend 30min+ shaving...,"I've had this razor for about 3 months now and it gradually seems to decrease in quality...for shaving, the middle foil doesnt seem to cut much at all, anywhere, to cut close i'm forced to use the teeth...which have began to pull far too much to make my shaving and trimming quite painful...trimming any hair that is remotely thin (leg hair) is extremely time consuming also, the teeth (used in conjunction with the trimming attachments) only catch about 5% of the hair that hit against them.and as also stated, in order to take the attachments off, the entire head usually snaps off also"
3,"Good for shaving, bad for clipping","In short, if you use the clipper guards, it gets clogged up with hair when dry, or is completely useless when wet. If you take off the guard, it works great wet or dry, and indeed won't nick your most sensitive of areas ;) If you want no hair, get this. If you're looking more for ""manscaping"" then get some other clippers."
4,Norelco BG2020 Bodygroomer,Excellent product. Works dry or in the shower. Only downside is it doesn't work on your face. Other than that you can use it anywhere without worrying for cuts.
2,"Shaves Great, if you can get it all done in 2 minutes!","I like the way it shaves, and when I first got it, I loved it. But now that I have had it for a few months, it just doesn't hold a charge, so I have to shave in 2 minute intervals: Shave- wait 20 minutes; shave-wait 20 minutes. If they had a wired version, it would be great."
1,Close Shave? Yeah right.,"Bodygroom didn't give a close shave at all, and I had to go over the same area at least 8 or 9 times to see even the slightest change and this was all done against the grain! Horrible shaver, the trimming attachments are cool I guess, they work fine, but for a close shave this thing is just ridiculous."
3,lacks cutting ability,"this shaver does not trim well as it takes many times to trim a small area,& the attachment falls off easily."
3,Great until it conks out.,"I've been through two of these so far. First one lasted about 13 months, then stopped taking a charge (it was the shaver, not the charger). Second one lasted 6 months and the button became stuck and you could not turn if off or recharge it, so it sat in the bathroom sink bouncing around for 8 hours until the juice ran out. They say they have a 2 year warranty but it's not worth the postage to send the stupid thing back.When it works, it gives a very effective and painless groom everywhere, really liked the ease of using and the result from it. Blades seem to last about 7 months before they need to be changed, using it once a week."
2,Worked properly for about 10 months...,"Purchased in March 2010, after using the trimmer once every two weeks on most of my body for about 10 months the clip that holds the blade foil became very loose. About a month before that the shaver grew noticeably louder and louder due to this but did its job properly. At the end of the month however, normal usage(very little pressure against shave spots) caused the foil to pop out every few minutes."
2,Great while it lasted...,"I was a huge fan of the bodygroom until the thing got stuck in the on position in the middle of the night (apparently a common problem with this product). I figured out how to stop it by having it on the charger, but at some point it stopped holding a charge. For the price of the product I expected to get more use out of it than I did. I used it maybe 10 times, if that, over a one or two year period. I was very sad when it stopped working and I had intentions of buying a new one until I read some of the bad reviews on Amazon. I think I will try investing in a barber type shaver instead. I never really needed the waterproof option, it was just convenient that I could shave over the tub rather than having to stand over a towel. It was great while it lasted, but I suspect barber type shavers will be longer lasting."
4,it done good,"yeah so i picked this up after dealing with a normal size cordless hair clipper - like the ones used in a barber shop. even though it might not match up in cutting power or speed, the bodygroom can definitely get into spaces and grooves the larger my older one cannot. take your time and you can too can look like a dude on the cover of GQ. in addition, i really like the fact that you can go without attachments and just use the foil. i was pretty afraid that i would cause some major bleeding but the actual trimming blades are well designed not to catch skin. aside from some VERY light nicking, i came out clean. well done norelco!"
3,"OK for chest, underarms, but down below not so good","I was excited to try this by the funny video on the Norelco site. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to the hype. It works fairly well as a body trimmer with the guards. They do fall off a bit too easily though. I tried using it in those sensative areas down below with faily poor results. I've shaved there with disposable razors for years and never cut myself. The Bodygroom cut me several times. I was being very careful and ""pulling the skin tight"" as the directions state. I wouldn't really reccomend this product."
4,Good Product,"I was looking for a product that I could une in the shower. This seemed to be the best on the market, so I bought it. It works fairly well. I am not too impressed with the guard sizes. This product may work better dry."
4,Bod shaver,"Great unit not exactly what i'd expect the trimmer guides are bout useless unless u wanna look like something out of the 70's cutting a mean bush but the unit is alot less irratable than using manual shavers, creams and other products i've used. I have sensitive skin and usualy have a huge outbreak when i cut body hair not so when i used this product. The charger could use some lcd screen's and state of charge indicators but given the limited time u use the product probaly would be a over kill since there are some areas that could be upgraded ergonomics and guides i gave this a 4 stars"
1,Good Idea; Poor Item,I loved the idea of this product. It was highly recommended by a men's magazine that I read recently. I wanted to utilize this product for all of my personal grooming needs.The notion that you can use it in/out of the shower and wet/dry was very appealing.I wish it lived up to the hype.This product ripped instead of cut. It was very painful. It also gave me razor burn despite my multiple attempts to utilize it correctly.I returned it.
2,only fair,"The product is easy to use, but it really doesn't trim hair as easily as the ad made me think it would. I did not realize unitl it arrived that it could not be used for facial hair as well. I thought I was buying an instrument that could be used for all kinds of body hair. Mostly I am disappointed. It does only a fair job."
5,Amazing,This is the best shaver for body grooming period.Just go slow especially the first time around and be amazed. No nicks so far and I have used this in the nether regions of my body. 5 stars!!!!
3,smooth,"this was an impulse buy to try to avoid shaving the groin area with a straight razor. I have had a difficult time to get a complete shave over certain parts, but there is not pain and no left over bumps. so the skin is clean and smooth, but not all the hair is gone. I am still experimenting with it. overall i am glad i purchased it for th no pain factor."
1,Save Your Money,"Your out of your mind if you buy this. Its better used as a paper weight than a trimmer or shaver. Second use and the foil came right off. My god did it hurt! I couldn't get it back on, shaver was destroyed. :( I consider myself to be the ultimate consumer. Especially of useless gadgets but this one tops the list. If you want a good trim and shave in the shower of your most important parts here is want i recommend. Buy a Fusion 5 and a Wahl trimmer. The cheap AA battery type from your local drug store. I paid $10 of mine. I use mine in the shower every week despite that it says keep it dry. I have had it for 2 years and I get it soaking wet and never had a problem. Cuts right through wet hair. Save yourself the money,time and frustration. If your going out on a date you'll save yourself the embarrassment when your unmentionables and the garden looks like the gardener was drunk."
1,Surprisingly Bad,"I'm stunned by all the good reviews this product has received. I'm not that hairy of a guy, but this product simply did not work well and, in some cases, not at all. I required frequent cleaning of the most minute amount of hair in order to work at even a minimal level. I recommend that you buy something more powerful and a better design."
4,AWESOME!,I would definitely say this has made life ALOT easier. I have not tried it in the shower because I believe it is easier to use regardless outside when your hair is dry. It would be nice if there was another attachment that was a tad longer but the pubes grow back fast enough anyways so it's not that big of an issue. I would recommend this product and think that it works excellent for the money spent!!
3,"Good Product, Some flaws","I have thick hair. The blades easily clog in the shower and I spend more time cleaning it than I do trimming. It does what it claims. I would like more efficient blades and maybe a larger trimming head. I like how it has blades on both sides of the head. The part in the middle, like an electric razor head, trims below the skin surface. On wet skin, it gave me a bit of razor burn, even with soap applied. All in all, it works well and does what it claims to do. I'm pleased."
2,Not what I expected,"Very disappointed with this product. It does work however, not very well.It takes a 3x longer to shave with this as you have to continually go over the same areas to get them smooth. Not all that it was advertised to be."
1,"Mine broke after 2 months, no support","Mine worked well for about 2 months, at which point it just slowed down to the point of being useless. The Philips website is useless, suggesting I take my $40 to a nearby appliance repair store...to spend more than $40, for sure.Perhaps I got a lemon? I'll wait for version 2.0"
3,"Great idea, but...","This is a great idea, but the execution is lacking. On the plus side the blade angle makes some trimming easier, but the plastic combs are difficult to remove, don't offer a high degree of flexibility in grooming lengths, and the shaver can only be recharged on the stand (the charger can't plug into the shaver).But the biggest issue I have is this: If men these days are supposed to do stupid things like shave their backs, then why don't manufacturers make shavers with longer handles? As is, you practically have to be a contortionist to use the silly thing. (Or duct-tape it to a broom handle.)"
1,Great Body Shaver... If You Want To Spend The Whole Day Shaving!,Take it from me.. This shaver sucks! If you want to spend the weekend tryin' to remove three hairs from your upper knee cap then by all means be my guest and buy this thing. You'll love it!!
3,WTF Amazon,"This review doesn't involve this product but it's price. I do not yet own the product. It used to be $27 a few weeks ago. Yesterday it was $30. I was going to order, but forgot. Now it's $36. For that price I might as well get the $50 professional model. What's going on here Amazon? Will it be $30 tomorrow, or $45?"
1,Waste of money,"- works not very well, worst shaver/trimmer i have ever had.- the guards are useless, because this shaver works only on very very short hair."
2,Design flaw,"The metal foil piece is a neat idea, but you have to remove it often to make sure the blades are clean and the hair isn't stuck in it. The foil piece on mine broke where it attaches to the main handle/body. It doesn't work so great when it's wet, and so I'd suggest to stick with using this product when dry. Battery life could definitely be better as well. For a remotely close trim, don't use the attachments. Otherwise, it works but I'm sure there are others out there worth the money."
2,It's not all that!,"I read all the juicy information as you all did too... It's not all that!!! It gives you shave bumps, If your not safe with it, it will tear your testical skin & you have to put work into it... Other then that, Its a good design.From a scale of 1 to 10 I'd rate it 4.5. If I'm going to have shave bumps, I might as well stick to a Razor."
2,"Decent groomer, not for close shaves","I still own and regularly use a Braun shaver (when they were still made in Germany) from circa 1997. Its only needed 3 foil replacements and still works well. I say this merely to point out that I know a good product.Owned another Philips Norelco shaver in the past and didn't like so not sure why I bought this one.The good: Cord freeWorks decently as a trimmerThe bad: Doesn't work as shaver particularly well (I am not particular hirsute either)The foil recently broke (not worn out -- broke), after a couple years of light use"
2,Get what you paid for,"Bought two of these, the first one, the groomer part on the head got pushed in. Pretty much became unusable. A few months later I figured I would give it another shot and purchased another one. Same thing happen. If you are expecting quality from this piece of garbage, look elsewhere or, shell out a bill and get something that wont break after a few good uses. Hope that helps whoever reads this."
5,Smooth and comfort with this Shaver,"It trims down below just fine, and like that it comes with different size trim gards. I can also trim my eye brows with a easy sweep of the shaver with a comb."
2,There has got to be better alternatives,"My experience with the Bodygroom has been pretty awful. It doesn't cut very close at all leaving a lot of rough stubble. It will also get snagged in all the wrong places. It definitely makes me want to tryBraun Cruzer 6 Body Cruzer, 6 Body Shaver."
4,"Excellent for shaving to avoid razor burn, other irritations","An amazing tool to shave large and small areas alike on the body. When hair is long, it's hard to trim, even with the attachments--actually shaving without the attachments was a little faster, though it pulls on the hair more. Once the long hair is gone maintenance is easy if you keep up with it. Don't expect to be able to get everything in the little nooks and cranny next to your carrot and plums, you'll still need a normal razor to clean that up nicely. Overall, an excellent product."
4,great reliable shaver,"even though this product is for men i am a woman that uses it on a regular basis. my previous shave was the remington womens wdc7000 wet/dry shaver. i got tired of expenses piling up for cleaning solution and foils and cutters for that model so i decided to give this norelco a try after reading all the great reviews here. it is definitely one of the best shaving products around - it keeps a long charge (longer than the 50 minutes it says it keeps), shaves very well no matter where on the body you're shaving, and it's extremely easy to clean. it does everything i need it to do. the only cons i have about this product (and why it's 4 not 5 stars) - the attachments are useless and the foils are super super delicate and easy to bend even just shaving (creating more chafing than normal) requiring quicker replacement. i would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an every day shaver or even just a good travel razor that can go in a carry on bag."
5,Excellent,"As most people said, it's a little rough if the skin or the blades are wet. Also, if you use it on thicker hair, like as a beard trimmer, it tends to take a few more passes (hairs get stuck under the trimmer blades).Other than that, I love that I can do all my grooming before I take a shower, then rinse the unit under the water and hang it up while all the hair goes down the drain -no real cleanup."
1,Disappointed,Only got about 30 uses out of this before the power button got stuck in the on position. Very poor quality in general.
2,pass and just get a trimmer,"This is not very good for any trimming at all above the waist (chest, back, neck) if you have decent growth. The plastic comb extenders do very little to help.You basically need to use this thing a few times a week if you want to make sure the hairs are short enough for trimming. Otherwise, you really need to use a trimmer first and then use this to get even closer.Worst of all, if you have any long hairs at all they quickly get caught in the trimmer and cause the foil cartridge to yank out. That's quite painful."
2,"Great idea, poor execution","This is a typical Philips product -- great idea, but poor execution.The Bodygroom does everything it promises, and better than anything else I've ever tried. I can shed my winter coat in about the third of the time it used to take me with a sideburn razor.After a few uses, though, the metal foil became bent, and now only one side of the razor is usable. It should be replacable, of course -- even the manual says so. But every time I call or write Philips they tell me the replacement heads aren't available yet.If that wasn't irritating enough, the battery life is really poor, and gets worse every time you use it. You can't run it off A/C power. And there is no battery indicator light on the unit, which just screams of cost-cutting.I'll probably end up buying another Bodygroom since there really isn't any other option. But as soon as I can switch, I will."
4,Pretty good!,"It's a pretty good shaver. I like it and still use it. Managed to cut myself once but, otherwise a pretty good and useful thing!"
4,Seems fine so far,"Got mine a week or so ago and have been happy with it so far. After reading the directions you should note that unlike an electric toothbrush, you should not keep this on a constant charge, but take the cord off the stand. Charge as needed. The charger has a light that goes off when it is fully charged.The groomer trims and does a good job."
4,Does what it says ot does,"This is a cool device. Works well. Just wish the battery was of the newer type where you didn't have to worry about overcharging or ruining its ""memory""."
4,Decent Product,Does what it's suppoesed to. Especially food for taking the hair stubble down all the way to flat.Problem: The hair trimmer part isn't as good at going after long hairs as it is going after the stubble.
4,happy with it,"i like this, it's a good price and it works. I haven't knicked myself yet. i wish the could of made a better cradle/charger for it.editafter a few month of use it stop charging. but it worked really well so i ordered a replacement.3 stars."
4,This is better... when dry...,"I've owned this product for over 2 months, and have used it 4 times since my purchase. The item works very well as described. Short charge times, product worked fine for an hour on without charging (I'm not that hairy, just left it on to see if it would last that long, then I got bored of waiting). The attachments are easy to attach, remove and reattach. I would recommend using the product when your dry as opposed to being in the shower, but that's just a general recommendation."
4,Works as advertised,No need to purchase the more expensive updates to this unit. Works well with almost no nicking or pulling.
5,Best Shaver Ever,"This is probably the best mechanical razor on the market. I bought the Sharper Image equivalent at Ross because it was marked down to $15. It worked great. ONCE!! And then it didn't turn on again. So I started searching for another one and when I read reviews here on Amazon and found out that the same thing happened to nearly every person who had bought the Sharper Image body shaver, I started looking elsewhere. I found the Phillips Norelco Bodygroomer and the reviews were substantially positive. I bought and although the shaver feels like you overpaid when you first handle it, It works like a pro. Although I fell in love with the way the Sharper Image body shaver worked across my body, the Phillips Norelco worked better. I can shave across my arm pits and private area with ease. When my face shaver's battery died in mid shave last week I used this to finish the work and even did a better job. This is a great product and definitely worth the price.Jesus ^_^"
2,"Works great on thick, coarse hair","Doesn't sound like the title to a negative review, does it? How about if I specify that it ONLY works great on thick, coarse hair?If you're at the Robin Williams level of hair coverage, this shaver will do an awesome job of shearing you. But unless you want to wait until you're Robin again before using it again, what you now own is a skin-reddener. I could even live with skin irritation if it still shaved the few-days-worth of regrowth, but it doesn't even shave at that point. It's /just/ skin irritation.Anyone with so much body hair they want to shave it will likely want to keep it off, and this shaver will not help you do that. You're better off just using a normal razor on chest, stomach, arms, and legs, and the very goodMANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaveron the back. This product just doesn't work as well as it should."
4,Norelco Bodygroomer,This is my second one- the first broke after about 5 years. It does the job for a reasonable price.
5,Awesome,I have owned this shaver for about a year and a half and it is defiantly worth buying. Works everywhere and I've never had a problem with discomfort after using it.
4,Great..for the price.,"I gotta say, I love this little machine. I think it works perfectly for what it's intended for and for the price. At first, I got a nick or two, but once my body adjusted to being shaved in certain areas, it worked great. The only thing I feel that it could've used is a ""low battery"" indicator. That would help with preventing cuts and preventing being able to shave certain parts only half ways. I would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a convinient way to groom the body. You can even use this shaver in water, and even better, with shaving cream. Very cool."
1,Does not Cut Hair,"This item does not cut the hair, it just likes to rip them out, doesn't work, dont bother. I returned mine."
2,Not terrible...,"After hearing about this when it was being promoted on the Howard Stern show I decided to pick one up. The shaver itself has a nice comfortable design. However, as noted in other reviews, the guides are awful. They do not do a good job of guiding the hair to the blades, making your trimming look uneven and sloppy. Another problem I have had is when trimming without the guides the blade unit has a tendecy to pop right out of the shaver. Sure it easily snaps back into place, but itis annoying and can easily mess up what you are doing. This product is a great idea, but something really needs to be done about how well it works with the guides, as I don't always want to go down to bare skin."
2,Norelco BG2020,"To begin, I will say that I have Mediterranean blood in me, and therefore have thick hair. I purchased this groomer to reduce the hair on my chest and abdomen prior to swimming. The attachment combs for trimming longer hair is worthless, it wouldn't cut through any hair length or density. Once I reduced the hair with another beard trimmer, I began to use the shaver. Shaving is also sub par, for I have to use multiple passes (>six) to remove most of the hair.I used this shaver maybe ten times in the past year, and now the on/off switch will not work. That is the end to that!Pros:Handles good.Can work when wet.Cons:Made for blonde /hairless men.Attachment combs are useless.Does NOT shave well at all in the groin/arse area.On/off switch broke down after one year of light use.Final word, if you are a hairy man your best bet is to use a face trimmer and then use a good old fashioned razor. If you have thin/light body hair then it might work for you."
1,look for alternative,"It does it's job against thicker hair, but for thinner hair it just pushes it around.after two month of usage it stopped working, so I decided to just take it apart and guess what I found. WATER.they claim it's water tight but water was everywhere, battery, motor, etc.Seriously look for alternative before considering this one."
2,Could be a lot better!,"Not that effective and takes a lot of time to get the best result.Sometimes, the blades are stuck and if you pull it the top part come apart. I probably won't return it but it is more like a powerless trimmer."
2,Big promise little delivered,"The way the product was described I had expectations at that level. But the shaver took for every to cut, each area must be gone over many times, the razer continually clogs and must be cleaned and, since it takes so long to cut an area the battery gives out."
3,Battery is not replaceable,"I purchased my Bodygroom in October 2006. The battery lasted until the end of 2009, a little over three years. Only then did I learn from Philips that ""All our Norelco bodygrooms are non-serviceable units and does not recommend the replacement of trimmer batteries as the cost of the replacing batteries is comparable to the cost of a new trimmer.""Good product to use, but what a waste. I recently bought a rechargeable battery for a Wahl trimmer for less than $10. I will look for another brand for a replacement, not another Bodygroom."
1,Not a quality effort,"Unfortunately Philips, like many multinationals these days, destroy hard-won brand equity by selling cheap and nasty products. Once in hand this groomer looked decidedly mediocre, but even worse didn't cut particularly well. The attachments slid off while in use and the cutting foil deformed within the first couple of weeks. Fortunately the price accurately reflected the quality."
4,philips norelco bodygroom shaver,"i am a woman, and i bought this men's electric shaver to use on my legs, underarms, and bikini area. the main reason why i bought it was because i have a mangled leg from an accident, and i found it hard to shave around all the bumps, ridges and scars with a disposable. it works fine, but not as smooth as a cheap disposable razor. you can actually feel it pulling the hairs...not terribly painful, but i can feel it. it has not cut me once since ive been using it, for about a month now. i am happy with it."
5,"A Righteous Shave or Trim...Here, There and Everywhere","The Norelco BG2020 flatout works. It runs strong and cuts quick & clean. No pulling...and no nicks. Remember to hold any loose skin areas taught..or else. The attachments work fine and provide a nice trim-length range. I haven't tried it wet, and the instructions state it works better dry. In any case I'm 100% satisfied...but for just $35.00 make that 110%."
5,my hair is not there!,"really, i bust this out every few days for a shave and my hair just runs away in fear. it takes me about five-ten mintues to clear up my wedding tackle."
5,WOrks Great,"This product works exactly as advertised. I have not used it ""wet"", but for dry shaving body areas it give a close, smooth shave.I have not used it on my groin area yet. I've become used to a razor in the shower to keep that area smooth, but will use it to keep things trimmed up as needed.Overall this is a great product."
4,Good enough to trim the man bush,This is exactly what I was looking for. As an alternative to a straight razor this is much easier and almost as smooth. The blue clips are great for side burn trimming and prolongs hair cuts as well. Overall for the money its well worth it.
4,"Its nice, need charging alot, but happy with it.","My husband uses all the time and he likes it, just gripes because it needs to be charged often."
1,HORRIBLE!! - STAY AWAY,"Bought this after reading some of the good reviews - mistake!!! Not only does it have an odd shape, but the guards fall off constantly - very poor design indeed!! Buy anything else, save your moneyI love the Philips brand but, what were they thinking? I cant believe this went through R&D;, was tested and, of all things, passed - baffles the mind. VERY disappointed..."
3,expensive replacement foils,"I really liked this product and gave it a solid 5-star rating after purchase. But after less than a year of light use, the shaving foil broke. Other reviews indicate this is common and the instructions recommend replacement every six months. Problem is, the foil is $12 plus $6.99 shipping or $24 if bought directly ... which is crazy, considering that I only paid $36 for the whole device. Norelco either needs to include replacement foils or make it easier to buy them. Wouldn't mind paying $5 with free shipping, but $24? Of course, Norelco wins, b/c I tossed the whole thing and bought a new device. The latest version works without the foil on the trimmer, so it should last longer."
4,"Great product, but a few issues.","This thing works great as everyone else has pointed out, but the main problems with it are:1. The battery. Do NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT leave this device consistently charging. In a matter of months the internal battery will be ruined and the charge will only last 15 minutes tops. This isn't really the fault of Norelco, but traditionally, I have left my electric razors plugged in and never had a problem.2. The on/off button sometimes sticks. It's not the greatest design in the world, but if yours should get stuck, apparently Norelco will replace it if its still under warranty. If it's not, the shaver comes apart pretty easily and it's a simple repair.I just bought a second bodygroom, because on my first one, i killed the battery (a few minutes then dies) and it's stuck in the on position (even after the fix, i believe the constant charging may have done this as well).So don't leave it plugged in and you'll be fine!"
5,Awesome for body hair trimming!,"This product works great everywhere. It's by far the best body hair trimmer I've had. I use it on my neck, chest, stomach, privates, and more. Have not had a problem and I've had it for almost a year! 5 star item for sure."
3,"Not the best not the worst, well priced though","I am actually just purchasing my second one of these. It's a fairly decent razor but heed some of the warnings that it probably won't last you more than a year. I started having some problems with the razor about six months in but coaxed about six months more out before it went kaput.It is not the quickest and you may have to go over an area a couple times,, but it never hurt and I don't recall too much irritation, if you are looking for ultra smooth go with a razor,, but if really just doing normal grooming this is sufficient. While I was mad about it breaking down,,, 30 bucks for a year is pretty good... So i went with it again because anything cheaper seemed real cheap and I can't see myself going north of fifty for a groomer."
1,Very disappointed,"Maybe I have a defective product, but this thing hardly cuts anything. Even if I make 10 passes over an area it still won't get everything. On top of that it pulls hair regularly and the cutting block falls out easily. It's unusable."
3,good while it lasted,"Had this since early 2007, one day couple months ago the power button broke and it just died. No problems using it in the shower but yes you have to stop and clean couple times. Also have to be gentle when removing the blade for washing, I can see if not careful you can break parts off. So it is what it is, a 3 star product."
4,Philips BG2020 Bodygroom Shaver,"Amazing product, it's way better than using a razor, I'm glad I bought this product or else I will still be having nits and cuts while using razor. The battery last a long time but I wish it can last a little longer so I don't have to charge it all the time."
2,"Works well, not perfect","This is a nice little machine for trimming up most any part of the body. It isn't a super close shave, but it's not meant to be other wise you would end up with painful ingrown hairs. Doesn't chop through thick areas of hair very fast. I have gotten a couple of minor cuts when shaving my pubic region, but that isn't the fault of the trimmer. There is really no way to be totally safe shaving loose skin like that. Overall I would recommend it.UPDATE 5/6/2012: A few months back this shaver stopped holding a charge. Works for less than a minute before dying now. Very disappointing that less that 2 years old and with very occasional use the battery would go like that. This is now the 2nd bad experience I have had with Norelco products and the last time I will ever buy one."
1,Died in less than three months,"Used it once a week with average results, had to charge it every three uses or so, around the three month mark the device refused to turn on, even though the charger indicated a full charge.Someone skimped on something while designing this"
2,Cuts but doesn't last,"I've owned two of these. Both of them cut very well and would, easily,be worthy of 5 stars were it not for the fact that both died within an 18 month period. I just had the second one die, now. The button to turn the device on and off failed on both units and, quite obviously, rendered the device useless. With the second unit, I had to pry it open and cut a power cable just to get it to shut off. Even pressing the button on the circuit board, itself, didn't work.I needed a replacement and, based on my experiences with the Bodygroom line, I went with a Remington. Hopefully, the Remington can combine the very close shave of the Bodygroom with some sort of longevity."
3,Bodygroom BG2020,"Most of my experience with this item has been good. The style, trimming attachments, and most importantly ergonomics are very good. By ergonomics I am mean the shape, which with practice allows you get those hard reach places (mostly the back). My gripe is the trimmer head started falling out, a lot. My unit may have been defective, but I wanted to mention this anyway. Since my experience has been good overall I am going to give the BG2040 a try."
3,"Great, but has a freakout and dies.","I have had 2 of these products. They are great, and do exactly what you would expect. Except that after about 12-13 months, both of the units I have had suddenly had a meltdown, turned themselves on and would not shutoff until the battery had run out on its own. The units were completely useless after that. I have since ordered a BG2030 and happily await its arrival."
3,No longer use,"I think I bought this product to shave my man parts. You know, chest, back, etc. Ultimately I lost the foil blade and they are crazy expensive to replace. Even before I lost the blade, I came to realize that men are supposed to be hairy. As long as you don't let it get too wild, I think you're ok."
3,Returned,"Had it for 30 days and then returned it. My intention was to use it in the shower so that I wouldn't have to sweep up my hair every time I wanted to trim. However, it does not trim body hair well when in the shower. But I guess you can't expect much for trimming wet hair."
3,Good for a year,I got this in February 2009 and has been using it regularly. I did not have serious problems like it picking on the skin and stuff (even though I am using it directly without those blue accessories) but certainly you need to be careful. While it worked nice for a year it is slowing giving in.My main problem with this is that the sound it makes increased multi fold since a year or so. The sound can get really annoying! Also I think the battery is slowly dying on me. Bottom line I wouldn't recommend this product.
2,"Its okay, wouldnt purchase it again","I bought this with the intention of using it occasionally when i got lazy and didnt keep up grooming around my ""box"" (female) just to get down to a more managable length to then use my traditional razor.i didnt use it very ofen and from the beginning i didnt think it cut that well ... and i never really attempted to get any sort of smooth shave with the foils. i had it for about 2 years and used it maybe a dozen or so times and it quit working. it showed it was getting a charge when put on the base but it wouldnt turn on. i didnt really think hair got stuck under the blades like some others complained about though i only used it in the shower so maybe that helped rid the hair with the constant water flow.this was my first electric razor so i dont have anything to compare it to, but i know i will not purchase it again. i agree with another reviewer stating a $40 razor obviously isnt the best but also shouldnt be a throw away."
4,i like it,"it works as expected. its really waterproof, which is a great feature. ive even been using shaving lotion with it which helps with the corseness of the hair removal. im thinking of starting to use the Philips Norelco Electric Razor 1090 arcitec Rechargeable Cordless Tripleheader to shave my face as well."
