1,Dell Battery Replacement for D800 - Not Worth Buying,"Not worth buying. Three months after buying the battery, it would no longer hold a charge. I went back to my purchase agreement and found that they did not offer any warranty or contact information to replace the battery. I thought I got a good deal because of the price, however, I should have read more about the manufacture of the battery. Take the time to read the reviews before purchase, if there are no reviews, move on, there are plenty of other vendors who want your business.My battery will be a year old in May of 2012, if there is a one year warranty let me know. I would love to get it replaced. I may even change my review!"
5,Best deal going.,"This vendor has consistently provided the best service at the best price. As for the purchased Dell battery, I will be satisfied if it last though six years of fairly consistent use like the last battery did."
1,Ooooh No!,Got it on time. installed it and a month later it died. I'm a little surprised that it died so soon.
2,"Thinner, shorter than they used to be.","They stopped carrying XLs at the grocery store so I ordered these, but they seem thinner and shorter than they used to be."
3,XL is really NOT,SIZE XL is actually like a large. Very tight and not near a real Extra Large. Disappointing size wise.
3,"Small for size, short cuffs","I needed to replace my old red Platex handsavers. I am a guy, and my hands are medium large. I ordered the X-Large size. They were small and tight for my hands. The cuffs are really short compared to the old style."
5,great for men (to wash the dishes!),"We have trouble finding this size in stores, and they are the only gloves that fit my husband. He has allergies to dish soap, and these protect his hands well."
5,Playtex HandSaver Gloves: XL,"Finding XL gloves in the stores is not easy, so I am pleased to find a place to get them, and at a discount to boot."
4,Fit well,"I have medium-sized hands, and these XL gloves fit me well. They are comfortable and have lasted fairly well. I always manage to do something to damage them and cause them to spring a leak when I get rubber gloves, but I like these well enough that I ordered some more."
3,A bit overpriced,"Saw same item in the food store at about 30% less cost per unit. OK so shopping on line is not perfect, but overall not a bad way to go, especially with Prime."
4,"Art Chemistry -- ""Red Metal"" Patinas","These gloves work well for the nasty chemical used in ""Art Chemistry"" to apply patinas to ""red metals"" such as copper, bronze, and brass."
3,An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness,I have finished reading this book. This is the first book I have read about Bi-Polar where the author speaks about the moods. Most books I have read on the subject describe about which phase your in. I particually like the way the author described Manic Depressive & Bi-Polar. I agree also that the current term Bi-polar does not actually describe the condition well. This book is well written and i can identify with the author as I also have Bi-polar 11. I wish that i was as smart as the author. Even with her condition she has managed to achieve many things. I myself have never been able to master effectively the 'Black Moods'. I recomend this book to anybody who has the condition and also those who would like to know more about the condition.
2,Average--nothing spectacular,"With all the rave reviews, I expected this book to be spectacular. It wasn't. It was simply average, and nothing more than a bunch of stories about Kay's personal life, which I didn't find that interesting. Okay, Kay, you've got manic-depression and you're worried about telling your friends, your boss, you're worried about losing ward privileges, etc. I get it. I get it. Just didn't think Kay's story was interesting enough to warrant a 220 page book. A 3 page case study, fine. A book, no."
2,Please don't sell books with personal writing in it!,"The book was listed as ""good"" condition. It was decent, but not good, given it had personal writings inside the book."
2,boring book,"an unquiet mind seemed to have been writing by a very quiet and dull mind, no real feeling of emotion, and it seemed to end up being a very strong plug for the drug lithium.... no real alternatives explored, no other drug offered for consideration. the bipolar illness wasnt looked at for what it give you, in the way of great creativity. bipolar is a creative cycle of fullness and emptyness, receiving and giving of creative energy.thumbs down for such a narrow and traditional approach to bipolar."
3,An Unquiet Mind is Kay Redfield,"An Unquiet Mind is Kay Redfield-Jamison's memoir of a turbulent struggle with chronic manic-depressive illness and all that it entails. Vivid descriptions of deep depressions and the summits of florid mania are colored by the irony of the author's occupation as a professor of clinical psychiatry. While her account will leave many feeling privileged to have gained an otherwise inaccessible glimpse into this often crippling yet curious illness, it may well articulate some of the experiences of those who have confronted depression and\or mania in their own life. A truly enlightening tale."
3,TOUCHING,"UPON OPENING ""AN UNQUIET MIND"" I LOOKED FORWARD TO A PERSONAL AND MEDICAL TAKE ON THE SUBJECT OF MANIC DEPRESSION. UNFORTUNATELLY, THERE WAS NOT MUCH OF THE LATTER. DR. JAMISON WRITES WELL, IF SOMEWHAT REPETITIVE,AND DESCRIBES HER LIFE WITH MD IN AN HONEST AND PASSIONATE MANNER. THE BOOK ENTERTAINED AND TOUCHED ME, BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE DR. JAMISON,A SUCCESSFULL OVERACHIEVER, IS REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE AVERAGE MANIC DEPRESSIVE."
4,Really Helps to Understand,"Like others, I came away from this book with a far greater understanding, and more sympathetic view of those people in my life who suffer with manic-depression. I have good friends and cousins who wrestle with this disease, and though I tried to empathize, of course I couldn't.The one question I have, though, is that I thought people with manic depression who are on lithium should NOT drink alcohol? Certainly, the good doctor doesn't sound like an alcoholic, but there's plenty of mention of drinking... someone, please set me straight..."
4,Insightful,"""An Unquiet Mind"" was recommended to me by a family member to give me some insight into the mind of someone struggling with bipolar disorder. It is not a clinical analysis, but instead the story of someone with the illness and the effect, both positive and negative, that it had on her life. Jamison's clinical background gives weight to her observations of her own behavior, often giving both sides (formal and informal) to the thoughts swirling in her mind. Colloquial in style, I highly recommend this especially to those struggling with bipolar disorder or to family members of those with bipolar or manic-depressive disorder."
4,highly informative and compasionate,[[ASIN:0679763309 An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and MadnessRedfield Jamison is a psychiatrist who writes compassionately about her own experiences as a person with mania and mood disorders but also approaches it from the perspective of a scientist discovering what causes these disorders and how to treat them. Always compassionate and never boring. A must read for anybody who has problems in this realm her or himself or who has a close friend or family member with it. This book will make you understand why there is such a stigma surrounding this illness and why it is so difficult to be treated and for people who suffer from it to even admit to struggling with it. Highly informative reading.
4,Enter at your own risk,"This book shows a more personal and realistic view of the world through the eyes of one that suffers from bi-polar disorder. It is both frightening and beautiful. A must read for those that have friends or family members that also suffer from this disorder, it helps to explain some of the seemingly uncontrollable actions or behaviors. Put your judgement aside and let your mind go free."
5,Newly diagnosed,"If, like me, you're newly diagnosed with any form of bipolar disorder (bipolar II in my case), reading this enthralling, nakedly honest book will undoubtedly leave you thinking, ""Oh my gosh, I'm not alone in this!"" When I was given (doomed, I thought) the prognosis I immediately and painfully searched for some kind of witness to help me deal with what I sadly realized is a lifelong illness, and I found it in this book. I finished it in one evening and, if you're grasping for hope or just a baseline like I was, you'll have the highlighter out all while feeling like she's speaking your life's story!"
5,Kay Jamisons credentials,"I'd just like to correct something is one of the reviews.Kay Jamison is not a psychiatrist. She is a psychologist who heads a psychiatric department. If you have read this book, you know that.I've read over a dozen books on Bipolar Disorder. Being Bipolar myself, I really felt a kinship with Kay. My family also read this book and tell me that they now have a better understanding of my illness.A very good book."
3,An interesting read.,"This was the first stand alone book on Bipolar I have read, and the only one most of my family has read. It is based on the lived experiences of a Bipolar I sufferer (lack of a better word). Kay is a good writter but gets bogged down in accademia speak which is a bit distracting. Unlike the text book she has co written, in comparison, this is easy to read. I still sugest you read it, and keep it on your book shelf, as it promotes bipolar as something normal inteligent successful people can have, instead of the stigma that all people with Bipolar are stupid and dangerous."
5,Excellent roadmap for parents of bipolar children,"This well written, entertaining book unmasks manic depressive illness in clear language.The stories reveal the depth of the difficulty and pain the manic depressant endures. Her humor and honesty entertained me and kept me turning pages. It provides excellent descriptions of the symptoms and assisted me in dealing with my child, who suffered from the illness for years. It poignantly reflects the biases of people dealing with the afflicted person. It is easy to confuse the symptoms of behavioral emotional issues, versus physiological symptoms of the illness. This book made a life-changing impact on our lives. Thanks to Ms. Redfield Jamison for her courage to write it."
4,A personal account; good supplementary reading.,"If you enjoy memoirs and want to read a reflective account of life with the illness, this is not a bad choice. Dr. Redfield Jamison's style is literate, though a bit dry. Imagine, if you will, a book written by X-Files agent Dana Scully if the paranormal were inside her head, not outside."
5,"A ""must read"" for manic-depression patients and doctors.",The life success of the author despite her illness gives me great hope for my own future. This book should be recommended reading for all bipolar diagnosed individuals (my nurse loaned me her copy.) I plan on purchasing my own copy for my personal library. One of the best books of any subject I've EVER read. - Thank You--M. Rhodes
5,Inspiring and Insightful!,This book is an amazing look into the mind of a brilliant intelectual who suffers from manic-depressive. I would reccomend this book to everyone. It is one of my favorites.
2,"Somewhat informative and sympathetic, yet repetitive and...","a little too self-centered. Of course, any book by a m-d disorder sufferer about m-d disorder would necessarily be oriented in in the self. However, KRJ seems bent on repeatedly trotting out her credentials and pedigree to a nauseating extent. I found her to be pretentious."
3,well written but lengthy at times,"I really liked this book as it gave an understanding of what the illness is as well as the struggles that the author went through. i did find some paragraphs to be rather lengthy and found myself just skimming several sections. on a side note, i do work at a psych hospital so the topic was of interest to me. it reminded me a lot of ""the center cannot hold"""
4,Dispels the many myths I had,"Originally I had this idea that bipolar, or any mental illness could be linked to a lack of education, or loners who might be socially withdrawn.So I am grateful then that Dr Kay has written this book from her unique perspective.Thank you :)"
5,Awesome!,"I absolutely loved this book! It was such an easy read. I would especially recommend it to any psychology major looking for deeper information on manic-depressive (bipolar) disorder. Very detailed and informational, yet poetic and touching at the same time. Wonderful book. Glad I read it."
4,Charming book,"Obviously someone had read it, but I don't mind~~~ I just want to pay for it with a good price. Looking forward to read it."
5,Everything you ever wanted to know about bipolar disorder,"This author has used personal experience to describe her illness. It's not just another academic project full of research and interviews. The fact that she actually has the illness and can write about it so well is a testament to her strength and bravery to share it with the world. Sam Vaknin writes extremely well about narcissism, as he himself is a narcissist. Kay R Jamison is an expert on bipolar disorder. I would recommend this book to anyone seeking a career in counseling or psychotherapy."
2,SO not worth the time,"Kay Redfield Jamison wrote so movingly and lyrically in her book about suicide, ""Night Falls Fast,"" that I was interested to read her own story, and pick up some information about bipolar.Well, I got part of my wish. Jamison does indeed tell her own story, with a whole lot of self-congratulation thrown in there. It's nice that the author thinks so highly of herself, her family, her education, her position, her etcetera, but I really don't need to hear about it over and over and over again.As for information about manic-depression, this book is a dud. If you or a loved one have been diagnosed and you're looking for info or even just COMPANY, please look elsewhere. There's none of that here."
5,So True,As I read Kay Jamison's book I could put myself into every senario. As someone who lives with bi-polar It truly helped me to understand that a lot of my action and moods are related to the illness. The book gave me hope for one day learning to cope instead of succumb.
3,"A worthwhile read, but less riveting than promoted.","Rambling at times, this book is nonetheless a very worthwhile read about manic-depressive disorder. One must admire Jamison's courage in publishing the details of her illness, especially when considering her position with a major university. The utility of the book will certainly be to compel those, with this disorder, to avoid a decision of discontinuing medication therapy."
5,Human experience,Jamison's story of her battles against bi polar disorder hold true to anyone who has struggled with mental illness. One must admire her transparency.
4,a breath taking journey to madness,"An Uquiet Mind is one of the best books I've read in the last few years. as a psycology student, I read a lot about mood disorders, but this was the first time I came across such an honest confession on the manic depression illness. Kay Radfield Jamison tells the whole story without holding back and by that she takes you on a journey to both sides of the manic depression world - the ""high"" times, ""almost touching the stars"", and the bad times that follow - a distructive depression that took her to very dark places. Side by side with the information on the illness - is the honest true story of Jamison's fascinating life as a manic depression with all the good things the illness brought her, and the very bad times that almost cost her with her life. An important book for those who have to deal with manic depression, to those who have it, or just for someone who wants to read a very intersting life story."
1,A Dumb Book,"This book was hard to follow. The author cannot follow a clear chronology...cannot explain how it is that she is a ""Psychiatrist"" when she only completed a PhD in Psychology which would mean she is a ""Psychologist."" She gave no new insight on bipolar disorder that I didn't already know before. A waste of money.Reading this book will only leave you irritated. The author must have been manic while writing this book because she certainly had a delusional sense of self grandeur."
2,blech,"If you are looking for a book about bi-polar disorder, or even about living with it, this is not the book for you. This is a book to tell the world how adorable KRJ is, how well she has been loved by absolutely everyone in her life- and all these people are exceedingly good-looking & charming, btw. I found myself wishing halfway thru the book that I'd started counting at the beginning how many times she described a man as ""handsome"". All her relationships are with perfect, supremely kind, passionate, bla bla bla people. Yuck. Less about the disease than a desperate insistence that the author is FABULOUS.This book is not written in a professional tone at all, and is more of a preening, pretentious, vanity fest than a memoir of a sufferer of mental illness. Though she does still seem to be grandiose and rather too intense in her adoration of everyone who ever adored her (which seems to be everyone but her sister).I am very disappointed. And annoyed. And grossed out."
5,An empathy of experiences,"As somebody who has experienced some of what the author has experienced, I came quickly to appreciate the rich candor of her writings, the deep insights and often the ironic humour that came with the book. I found myself awakened with new insights to some of my own experiences. As much as I found some parts of her book to be troubling I also found them to be enriching despite the darkness. Certainly when Kay wrote of her more wonderful experiences I was heartened not just for her but for the possibilities of all of us who suffer from her condition. I found her couragious acceptance of her quiet new life to be in many ways most amazing. Her words have given me insights into my own resistance to taking medication that are still bringing up new possibilities and awarenesses with me. I am now seeking to read more of Kay's publications and have recommended this book to many people."
5,"Good transaction, good buy!",I was very pleased with the condition of the book. It was actually in much better shape than I had expected. Service was very quick. I am totally happy with my purchase.
3,Good book with too many typos.,Excellent information in this book for families of bipolar sufferers though a little poetic for my tastes. This Kindle version had dozens of typos. Absolutely unacceptable. Very distracting.
2,Not so impressed,Not as good as I had heard. A little excessive drama in the descriptive elements of the text. I would have liked more about her feelings and motivations.
1,Having trouble sleeping? Read this book.,Our Book Club made the mistake of selecting this book. The book is QUITE repetitive. Read the first chapter or two at the bookstore -- then put it back on the shelf; you will have gleaned all that is available. Sorry -- I don't want/mean to bash -- I just simply cannot recommend An Unquiet Mind.
4,an unquieted reader,"The author's approach is real, relevant and revolutionizing.Women who suffer with manic depression struggle in ways that can often be charted as early as age 5 but are usually undiagnosed until life is so out of control and/or unbareable.Jamison's personal story is inspiring in that she suffered her way into a victory.Isn't that all we really want. We just want to know that there is some meaning to the madness and that the moods will not overtake us in such away that our handicapped but hearty functioning is deemed invalid.Jamison's honesty was the thing I most appreciated. I've experienced days like she described and will use this memoir as a model."
1,This book is a miss,"Unfortunately, Jamison regurgitates all the same old tired cliches that have infected the pscychiatric profession. The profession is characterized by arrogance, condescension and patronization toward sufferers of all emotional illnesses. Sadly, Jamison is no exception. She and her colleagues are doing a great disservice to patients, by practicing an insipid form of treatment that has its origin in the relativism of the 60s. The sooner this generation of ""professionals"" retires, the better it will be for millions of people."
1,What's wrong with me?,"By the end of this book, I began to think I was the one with the problem. I have never had the highs Jamison seems to find so exhilarating. I have also never had the abysmal lows she speaks of. I must have a deficient personality. I guess I should be grateful."
3,"Interesting content, but not well-written.","As someone who suffers from depression, I found solace in many of the passages of this book. It was comforting to read about Ms. Redfield's experiences and feel them resonate so deeply within me. However, her narrative is very repetitive and at times hard to follow. I also believe it is a bit dramatic. She often ends chapters with sentences like, ""I could not have known then that the worst was yet to come,"" but then never quite delivers. Also, she over-uses many words, especially the word ""mercurial"" in reference to her moods. (I was about to throw the book across the room if I saw that word one more time!) Overall, it is a good read if you want to understand what it's like to live with a mental illness, but the critical reader will most likely be frustrated by the repetition, dramaticism, and lack of a varied vocabulary."
3,"Poetic, pretty and shallow.","Kay Jamison overused the thesaurus in her attempt to make manic depression appear beautiful, which it is NOT. Instead of expressing the true, heartfelt, humiliating, struggle of manic depression,she sidetracks the reader on her glorious love affairs and career. Although she was brave to come forward, there is a twist to it, because she probably should have majored in literature, which seems to be her real love. Despite all her advanced psychology degrees, do not believe that what you are getting is the true steak and potatos about bipolar illness. It's just poetic, pretty and shallow. This woman wants to be loved, and I don't blame her. But she could start by being more human and more real."
5,"""Must-Read"" for Manic-depressives","I still remember what a SHOCK it was to learn that ANOTHER woman had looked in the mirror and seen a demon staring back at her! It has been six years since I first read Dr. Jamison, learned that a woman could be ""crazy"" and still accomplish wonderful things. This book (with ""Night Falls Fast"") saved my sanity, if not my life. I am the same age as Dr. Jamison, but not properly diagnosed for DECADES. Would have given up, stopped trying new treatments without this inspiration. The only way to REALLY KNOW how this condition causes one to think, to FEEL, is from the INSIDE. The prose is beautiful, she does a great job of expressing feelings about her life (with the mood swings) which I would like to express to friends and family, also."
2,An Unquiet Mind,An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and MadnessThis book was so disappointing. She kept telling the same story over and over just in different locations.Very repetitions and very unrewarding. I gave it to the Goodwill. Would not recommend it for any insight into manic depression.
4,An Unquiet Mind,"This book was startling, unsettling but insightful into the mind of a woman who deals with bipolor disorder. I had to put it away at times and come back to it because I felt such sympathy for the author having to go through what she did in life. I lent it to a friend who's daughter is bipolar."
4,"Very emotional, well-written","While I don't suffer from manic-depression, I was diagnosed as depressed about two years ago. I noticed a lot of similarities between what I was feeling and what the author spoke of in the book. I found myself relating to her, even though her illness is much more extreme than I ever had. And, it also taught me a lot about manic-depression. I enjoyed this book, and I genuinely sympathized with Kay Redfield Jamison."
4,excellent inside view of a life with bipolar,"The author deals with mental illness professionally and personally and her candor and frankness give the reader valuable insight. She recounts her life growing up and as you later discover, her father suffered from the same mental distractions. But she pursues and suceeds at her career with the support of very knowledgeable and compassion friends and colleagues!"
5,A new understanding,I am starting to understand a disease that has plagued so many I know. This book helped open the door.
5,Quite possibly the finest memoir of mental illness yet written,"As someone who has suffered from major mental illness since puberty, I can say that seldom do I find a book about the subject where each memory, each idea, seems true and honest. Ms. Jamison tells her story with wisdom and compassion and thoroughness.Not to be missed by any student of contemporary American culture!"
5,An Eye Opener,"As a manic depressive, I found this book somewhat reassurring. It was a reaffirmation that I was not alone. There was someone out there that has felt and does feel the same things I do. Also, I am not always as verbally expressive as I'd like to be, so I shared this with my family. It was enlightening to them. We then discussed some of the differences and extremes compared to what they thought ""normal"" life is, in compared to mine. I disagree with some who thought it boring. I wonder, is it less boring for those of us who have to experience these things, as opposed to those who read it ""for a class""? All I know is, this book gave me some hope, despite the hardships she went through."
5,firsthand witness and scientific point of view,"Kay Redfield Jamison witness for us the momentum of the manic depressive illness. She does it as a MD and as a young women trying to conceal is own life and the manic tantrums.Perfectly written, she testify how the meds are working and how they must be adjusted the each outpatient. The telling of her trip to Scotland and Great Britain and the consequence of a part remission of the illness, is more useful than any other research works. You can't rely only on the meds even they are absolutely necessary. People with manic depressive illness have mind and feelings. They must work, with their parents, sibling and friends, on the surrounding life and find a way of living.The meds are the base, but the cognitive therapy, the way you look at the world, at your world, is the way to a almost real life. Kay Redfield Jamison has the strength to witness this for us and it is a very useful gift."
2,Celebrating medicine,"I'll let the back of the book speak for itself. Kay exposes a lot of very personal details about her life in this courageous book, but it wasn't my style of biography because she kept coming back to the same theme: take your meds if you want to be ""normal."" I think her exploration of manic depression was a bit limited here because there are many other theories of mania that treat it less as a disease and more as a way of coping with a fast-paced, ever-changing world. Her next book is better."
3,A comfortable distance,"For a memoir written by a psychiatrist about a life with mental illness this is strangely lacking in introspection. Many of us with persistent mental illness look back on a life filled with poor decisions and opportunities lost when our lives have spun out of control, which Jamison surely knows; yet somehow her life seems to have worked out very well indeed. How? By the end of the book I found her lack of interest in the question maddening. Is the only solution lithium and a circle of friends consisting of psychologists and psychiatrists?But I did read to the end, long after I lost interest in the author herself, simply because she writes so well, without artifice or cliche."
2,So?,"I am bipolar and this book didn't do much for me. In her defense, Ms Jamison did something very important in that she showed the world a manic depressive who had come to live in the real world and had succeeded. It takes a lot to undo what Patty Duke did when she made a movie depicting herself pitching King Kong fits and ruining everything - not an image that does a lot for the rest of us when we are out here trying to get insurance, jobs, and everything else. That's why Jamison's book is very necessary. However, as a bipolar person, reading about someone else's problems with the disease doesn't do anything for me. If I wanted that I'd write my own autobiography. I found this book egotistical, and if she meant to help me with my illness by writing it, then she could have talked a little more about my illness and a little less about the life she found so extraordinary."
2,simplistic overview,"Poorly written, although a good story of a woman's struggle with mental illness. I think she simplified what living with bipolar illness is like. It's more complicated than just going up and down in moods. The book disappointed me."
3,An Unquiet Mind,"Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison writes about her life dealing with bipolar. Her struggle with schools, relationships and her inner critic.My own psychiatrist recommend this book hoping I would relate that this was another woman struggling with illness and gaining the upper hand on. I really did not find that much I could relate with her since she has bipolar and I have schizophrenia. She pretty much examined her whole life and realized she had this illness very early in her life. I respect that she has accomplished much in her life. I don't know if I will ever accomplish to the degree she has done. You may not agree with my rating for every person it will probably be different."
2,Jamison struggles,"Perhaps there is no light at the end of the tunnel for sufferers of manic-depressive illness. Jamison makes this duly apparent in her memoir. I found the text extremely too long and verbose as well as boring. I appreciate the graveness of this disease to a greater extent, but do not feel inspired to read her other work, or any other work, in this field as a result of this uninspired memoir.Jamison spends a great deal of time explaining the race she is in for a tenured faculty position, yet spends even more explaining her relationships. The memoir reads similar to a romantic novel at times.Please note my perspective as an undergraduate student in a Madness and Society course, not a psychiatrist or otherwise mental health professional."
5,bi polar illness,"I found this book to be very helpful in understanding bi polar illness.My son suffers with bi polar and my mom also suffered with it. I finallyrealized that it can never be fully understood by anyone unless theyactually have it, but I have come closer to accepting it and learning how to cope with it."
4,It helped me understand Bipolar disorders.,This book was so helpful in understanding the struggles of people with bipolar. It was very easy to read and understand. I was so impressed by Kay Redfield Jamison's openness in sharing the conflicts and confusions she experienced. Her successes were an encouraging to all of us who love someone with a bipolar disorder.An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness
4,Unveiling the Mask of Bipolar Disorder,"Redfield Jamison gifted the world with her memoir about bipolar which targets the disorder from two angles: the professional and the personal. Story is always profound and powerful, and I greatly appreciated her commitment to honesty of what it means to live with bipolar. She truly combined the best of two worlds - the world of truth and the facts about bipolar, juxtaposed against her own story.Possibly the most eye-opening part of the book is her struggle with lithium, and she covers the pros and cons, and wonderfully illustrates the lifesaving effects of the drug. Although she explains the many side effects and the disadvantages of the drug, she also reveals how many times it has saved her life...for better or worse."
3,"Mile Wide, Inch Deep","I learned much about both M-D illness and the author's facinating life, about which I had equal interest. Both topics were shortchanged in the endeavor - I wanted to know more about how her family dealt with her problems (reader learns only about the author's perception of her family's feelings). I also wish the science of the illness was covered in greater depth. Perhaps this wasn't the book's mission, however."
4,Unbewildered,I really enjoyed this book. It helped me to understand this desease better. It was a very good read.
3,Perpetuating the stigma,"While Jamison's book is a noble, personal, and highly informative effort, I feel that the subtitle ""A Memoir of Moods and Madness"" does all of us a disservice. On the one hand, the psychiatric establishment bemoans the ""stigma"" attached to mental illness - yet sufferers themselves often describe themselves as ""insane"" or ""mad."" I believe this only furthers the very stigma which we are striving to combat. I wish that all of us, whether professionals or sufferers, would eliminate such terms from our vocabulary."
4,An Eye-opener,"An Unquiet Mind was recommended to me by my boyfriend who is manic depressive, and as my first initial taste of knowledge regarding manic depression I found the book wonderful in offering a general, over-all look at the illness. From the title, I was expecting to take a closer, more detailed look into the way Kay's mind was working in everyday situations.All up, it was an excellent introduction to a world I previously knew nothing about. Thank you for sharing Kay."
3,Fluff take on Tough Stuff,"Jamison's book wraps this ""descent into hell"" with a tidy bow. The path of a bi-polar sufferer is strewn with emotional human carnage that both the sufferer and the victims must endure...and no one touched by it is ever the same again.To know how manic depression can ravage individuals and families is to know what a truly fragile species we are.New meds are a great help, but it's a long,tough road for all involved. Her tale is a bit fluffy for any but the unititiated..."
4,Unquiet Mind,"I enjoyed this book for a variety of reasons. I found the author relatable, struggling thru school for instance. And her encouragement to ""stick to your meds"" finally resonated with me. I would recommend Madness in addition to this book."
4,An Unquiet Mind? A memoir of Moods and Madness,This was a recommended book to help me deal with a family member dealing with some of these same problems. It did help me understand what happens to someone who is experiencing mental problems. I think the author wrote a little too much about her medical education....and got a little too technical. But I would recommend it . Other members of my family are also reading it.
2,Not the best source to learn about manic depression,"For some reason, this is always the first book that people run out and get when they, or someone they know is diagnosed bipolar/manic depressive. This author, along with having a highly romanticized view of herself and her illness, simply takes the opportunity to yak about her life in academia, and portrays her illness as having the dramatic flair and drama of someone who's bipolar one. However, not most individuals have a textbook case of manic depression. I almost feel as though since she is so well-versed in the diagnostic aspect, she chose to paint her own life in absolute accordance with the DSM-V. When I was diagnosed, my parents bought this book and gave it to everyone thinking it would all help us ""understand"" my illness better. I couldn't relate to this book at all, and still don't, unless you have a personal interest in Kay's academic challenges or love life."
1,So disappointing--of very little help,"The book disappointed me bitterly. This woman does not understand severe, and I do mean severe, bipolar disorder. She grew up absolutely privileged, always had tons of professional and family support, was wildly successful in her career, avoided hospitalizations, had a very active social and sexual life (she brings that up a lot, probably to get the reader to pay attention). Her writing is not particularly creative; see, for instance, if you can possibly count how many times she describes someone as ""kind"" or ""handsome"" (she has preconceived notions that only beautiful people are valuable). Avoid it."
1,Wonderful world of manic-depression,"This subject matter is one that I was researching in order to get an honest portrayal of what it is like for a person to live with this disease, but this book was not it. What I got were glowing platitudes about her many friends who supported her, her travels and romances, and how she grieved the loss of those marvelous highs when she was manic. There is hardly a word about the cost to her in terms of her personal relationships as there is not one instance in which she may have alienated friends and family because of her disease. Instead everyone was so understanding, even in her professional life. Despite a suicide attempt, I got no picture of what this disease has truly cost her. I also wondered with her many detailed scenes of drinking alcohol, if she ever considered that that was exacerbating her symptoms or the efficacy of her medication. She seems to spend far too much time ruminating about her disease and glorifying it, and not enough time in the solutions."
5,Great Biography about a Great Man of God,"This book is truly a great biography of Bob Jones, Sr. The fact is the Ku Klux Klan happened to be a religious organization, not a racist organization when it first started. If you have your facts straight things can be looked at in such a better light.Bob Jones wasn't a perfect man, but he surely was a man of God."
1,Gutter trash in a golden glow,"If you've ever wanted to see what a monumental pile of excrement looks like when bathed in a beatific and saintly light by a fawning, supplicating paid shill passing for a biographer, this is the book for you.Racist and pig-ignorant, Bob Jones stood as a monument to American stupidity, xenophobia, paranoia, and malice while casting himself as a saintly man of god. The world would have been better off had he never been born, let alone managed to lure thousands of sheep into following him and giving him money. The fact that this hollow-souled gasbag managed to not only survive but thrive in the tepid sewer of evangelicalism tells you all you need to know of what a filthy and fetid place it is - and how foul the creatures dwelling within it."
1,"Leaving ""fingerprints"" all over my glasses!!!","These are awful. I don't know when it started (another reviewer said it happened to them after 3 weeks), but I just had to throw out what seemed to be otherwise fine gloves because they are leaving check-marked fingerprints all over everything I touch, most noticeably glassware. Whatever this stuff is, it's really hard to remove (actually I haven't completely removed the marks yet.. I just had to stop washing to leave this review!!). Stay away. I usually get the Casa Bella gloves, but tried these to save a couple of bucks... definitely not worth it."
1,No Cotton Lining,"Purchased this with the sole intention of having an additional layer (cotton lining) to keep hands warmer ... however there is no such thing as ""Super soft cotton, absorbent lining keeps hands dry and comfortable"" and do not be fooled - this lining IS NOT present.The seller responded quickly to my request to resolve the issue only to state that they shipped the correct item and have never had any complaints. BS!For this price, you can get better quality gloves!Am returning mine for a FULL REFUND!"
1,Sticky Residue,"These gloves deteriorate after 2-3 weeks and leave a smeary, sticky residue on dishes. I only used mine for dishwashing, and I do like to use pretty hot water, but these are meant for washing dishes and they should be able to tolerate hot water, right? It's a shame that they have this issue because otherwise, they would be great gloves. The arm length is nice, they fit well, and they are durable as far as not getting holes easily -- but the residue problem is definitely a dealbreaker. I won't be buying these again."
1,Do not use with bleach,"I cannot say 100 percent that these gloves are responsible for turning a white shirt purple, but all I can say is that I was soaking a white shirt in bleach because it had a small beige tea stain. When I removed the shirt from the bleach and wrung it out, I took it outside only to be shocked that the entire sleeve had turned the same purple color as the gloves! Is there a warning on the box not to use with bleach? Why else would I need rubber gloves? After sitting in the sun for four hours, the shirt faded from bright purple to dingy yellow, so it is still ruined."
2,Leave sticky residue on dishes,"These work well for about 3 weeks. They're long enough to cuff, unlike budget gloves. Of course you have to take care that you don't stab them w/ a fork or knife. They're not as strong as they used to be b/c they only have some cotton dust (flocking) stuck to the inside instead of the woven cotton lining they used to be made with. And after they've been used w/ hot water and dish detergent for about 3 weeks the latex softens and leaves sticky, dirty-looking residue all over your freshly cleaned dishes and glasses. So don't expect them to last longer than that when used daily."
2,Not what I ordered from this company.,"I finally found these gloves here so I ordered 3 pair. When they arrived, they were not the ones in the photo or discription. They were the NEW style. I was very disappointed."
4,The Best Gloves,I love these gloves. They are light yet sturdy. Ideal for all types of housework to protect our hands and nails. I wish they were more readily available. It took some time to get them.
1,No flock lining,I was very disappointed to pay so much money for this product only to realise that it was just an ordinary plastic glove. There was no actual flock lining which is the only reason I purchased the product as I am allergic to latex. Very disappointing and a waste of my money.
5,THESE GLOVES ARE THE BEST!!!,"I love these gloves! Found them at a Longs once and was really looking forward to getting a new pair, but unfortunately (for so many reasons!), my Longs has become a CVS, and apparently no longer carries these gloves. They are not only extra long, but they really do stand up to heat better than the yellow ones. I'm a bit of a hot water freak, when it comes to washing dishes. And you can use the hottest hot without your hands even heating up very much. I highly recommend these gloves!!!! Can't believe I'm actually bothering to buy dishwashing gloves online, but I've gotta have these gloves, they're just that good!!"
2,Disappointed in Video,"The balls are fine, but I was really disappointed in the video. It was about 45 minutes long and gave very little information about her method and why it works, the goals, etc. There are two subjects in the video, one using 1 ball and the other using 2 balls and no explanation as to why or what might be better for you. It seemed very unprofessional to me."
2,Not as good as his others,Dick is one of my favorite writers. I loved Do Androids and Ubik and Confessions of a Crap Artist. But this one found boring and derivitive of William Burroughs. I advise others to skip it.
3,So-So Sci-Fi,"The novel starts really interesting, but it loses intertia and direction by the end and, in my opinion, ultimately dissappoints."
2,A great plot - an addled delivery,"He may have a cult following, but like the characters in this novel, P.K. Dick appears to have been drug addled at the time he wrote 'Scanner'. The author in fact admits to this in his postscript. The plot is intriguing but fatally flawed with inconsistencies. The last fifty pages are so laden with filler as to be virtually unintelligible. If he intended this as a cautionary tale of drug abuse, PKD succeeded in ways he never suspected."
1,Painful Read!,"I was so excited to get this book, but it really sucked. I tried and tried to get into this book, but it was just painfully boring and nearly impossible to follow. Plus, it just came across as dated! I would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,"Amazing, scary, brillant and disturbing.","One of Dicks top 10. An incredible book, especially (although not exclusively) for those who have experimented with drugs themselves. Other great Dick books are (from the best down): UBIK, A Maze of Death, The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldrich, Now Wait for Last Year, Do Androids Dream... Definitly my favorite fiction writer."
5,Very Deep!,"I too thought the book was boring on the first read through. I read it again and now I am contemplating a third time. A Scanner Darkly is an amazing look at drug addiction and the war on drugs. One theme that I see in this story: The 'War On Drugs' is perpetuated by the establishment (Government), at the expense of the addicts, for the benefiit of the Government. This is perfectly clear when the ending is analyzed. That is, this book points a critical finger at our governments handling of the 'drug problem.'"
5,Great book,"Looking forward to reading more by this author. Funny, dark and cynical without sacrificing heart and connections between characters. Very good read."
3,Tioo much psychosis,"I can't say I enjoyed this work as much as some of Dicks other work. What appeals to me about his work is the chaotic out of control pace of his books, invariably taking some poor soul (and the reader) on a hellish (usually dystopian) journey through one warped scenario after another.I found this book to be actually quite slow paced, based predominately in Fred/Bob Arctors house. The book is very much an account of a long descent into drug-induced paranoia & schizophrenia and is rich with 60s/70s references and culture. But I found it lacking in ground-breaking science-fiction content and ideas.Readable enough, but not quite Ubik or Electric Sheep."
3,GREAT BEGINNING AND END . . . SHALLOW MIDDLE,"If someone were to ask me which author can consistently grab your attention with the very first sentence of a book, I'd have to say PKD, hands down. It all starts off with a man who is shaking invisible aphids from his body and he's afraid that they're going to eat him. If that's not weird, nothing is, and only PKD would have thought of it. But the bugs, though interesting, are not what this book is about. It is about drugs, and a cop that has to take on the role of a drug-user. The idea is excellent, sure, but I found it sometimes hard to follow--but never to the point where I stopped reading. But the ironic end of the book made it all worthwhile. And that's not even the end of the book, because then there's an epilogue written by PKD himself. Very moving. In my opinion, Confessions of a Crap Artist had a much larger impact and was better written throughout. But that's just me."
3,Psycodelic dual personality.,"When reading this book, try to follow the storyline. Then re-read it and try again. This is one strange novel and one that only survivors of the 1960's drug induced world can probably relate to."
2,Only got half-way through,"I'm willing to get just about any book a chance. I've read ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" and enjoyed it. This book is just too weird and disjointed. I have no idea what's really going on. I have no idea what the book is driving at. There are sentences of dialogue and such that barely even make sense after I read them 5 times over. The concept of the scramble suit and everything is really fascinating. I had to give up on this book because it was just way too much effort. I wasn't really enjoying it on any level. I may try reading it again, but I doubt it. I hardly ever give up on books, so I'm actually pretty upset that I had to give up on this one. I would only recommend this book if you're an absolute hardcore Philip K Dick fan. Otherwise, it's just a lot of confusing dialogue and strange chapters that seem to go nowhere and are hard to follow. I wish I coulda given this more stars, but I have to be honest."
3,scanner slips,"Scanner Darkly immediately pulled me in with its simple approach and conversational tone. The ideas and stories throughout the book seemed realistic and perhaps even true to a point. I was very interested to see which direction Philip K. Dick would eventually take the characters. However, I found the end of the book to be a very poor conclusion of the events that took place."
4,These are your brains on drugs,"A strange little trip into the mind of Bob Arctor -- an actor/mole/double agent/junky/nark whose brain literally splits in two. A kind of subtle, small story. I was expecting it to grow into a huge plot about aliens or a mega corporation seeking to control the minds of all humans. It's really not that. It's just about a few people tangled up in the world of Slow Death. A strange little ending. The dialog is a tad dated. Think 70's hippy slang (even though the story takes place in the 'future' of 1992). Funny to think that people in the future would be using words like ""foxy"" but that's my only real complaint about the book."
5,A Question of Identity,"Much has been said about this book in other reviews, but I find the loss of identity to be interesting. By the end of the book, before it's final amazingly well set up twists and turns that make it an extraordinarily well done novel, the main character seems to have completely lost his true identity as a result of the combination of his occupation and the drug he is addicted to. It is something to ponder. Is it possible to really lose yourself that way?"
5,"Frighteningly real, yet what is real?","Though this is PK Dick's own avowed favourite, it is not my own... However, this painful work is like a trip into our own consciousness, our own shifting realities."
4,A Scanner Darkly: The Anti-Drug,"With apologies to Nancy Reagan, I can't possibly think of a better ""Just Say No"" message than this haunting novel. Told through the eyes of Fred, an undercover police officer assigned to track drug dealer/addict Bob Arctor, as well as through the eyes of Fred's alter ego, the very same Bob Arctor, ""A Scanner Darkly"" powerfully demonstrates the paranoia, danger, hallucinations and hand to mouth existence of people in the throws of heavy drug addiction. Occasionally, difficult to follow due to being written from the perspective of people whose minds have been severely warped due to excessive drug use, this is nonetheless an entertaining, exciting and thought-provoking work."
5,Lovers of Life,"As the author says in his note, he is the novel. In fact, Philip Kindred Dick writes in ordinary language, about the inujstly punished lovers of life, through dramatic situations, exposing them in a comic style. With all his soul he expresses his regret for the hipocrisis of the installed system, twisting thw already twisted reality. Undoubdtly the book of my life. Very intense, funny, and very, very serious, and above all, extremily intimist. I take off my hat."
3,Bad Binding,"This is a paperback book. It is a thick paperback book (@460 pages). I paid a decent amount for it ($18.50)but wanted to read it after I saw the author (Horace Kephart) highlighted on the recent Ken Burns' special on national parks.The book arrived in very good condition so my quarrel is not with the shipment of the book. At my first attempt at opening, however, the ""glue"" or binding simply broke leaving the bottom part of the book disengaged from the binding. If I do not handle it with extreme care, the pages will fall out. I know not to break a book's back but this is simply very poor quality binding by the Land of the Sky publishers. This will make reading it difficult and will be an easy first give away for recycling. Too bad."
5,Excellent overview of Appalachian region,"Our Southern Highlanders is Kephart's masterpiece. For anyone interested in Southern Appalachia, this book is a must. It is full of rich narratives on his personal experiences in the Great Smoky Mountains, and gives an in-depth look at mountain customs, beliefs, and vernacular. Although some anthropologists and historians have issues with a few generalizations and stereotypes, it is beside the point. Our Southern Highlanders is one of very few primary sources about the region that are reliable, and though it may have flaws, is the closest insight modern readers have to 19th and early 20th century Appalachia."
3,Good Book,"Beautiful designs! Lots of style for all ages, elegant cables, lace and bobbles. Must see pics! But the women's patterns are all small, nothing larger than 38"", which is what my size 3 sister is! Other than that, she again peddles her expensive low yardage yarn line. Worth the price overall."
5,Good Value,"Product was as described. Good value, good price. Would recommend to others. I'm not going to write any more reviews since this is requiring me to write a certain number of words."
5,Sharp,"This cutter is great. It is sharp and solid. Better used with a hardwood, but did good on some pine also. Paid for itself after only 10 rosettes..."
4,underground rap,Hawk is a underground rapper what is this guy talking about in the first review hes ok also wish amazon had some of his other stuff
3,QuadGear UTV Cab Enclosure,"For the money it is probably the best buy you can get. Like others I too am experiencing difficulty in zipping the doors closed. No matter how warm or cold the temperature gets it continues to be difficult. There is not enough slack in the design of the enclosure to allow for easy zipping. I did find one flaw in the sowing of the parts together but I was able to rectify the problem easily. Again, for the money it is the best bargain I could find."
3,OK for the money,"I just received and installed enclosure on my 2011 Polaris Ranger. Amazon does not say so, but it DOES NOT FIT THE 2011 RANGER. The windshield hooks are made for the older style hood. I bought this knowing that I am going to cut out the windshield, so the fit of the windshield is not that big of a deal. The door is also too short for the 2011 Ranger.The velcro backing seem to be very sticky (I did not expect them to be). The roof and rear buckles attach it very well, but I wish there were several more in the rear.All in all, this works fine. I am using this to otherwise enclose my unit after I install a Lexan windshield. I do not like the plastic windows, so I would not recommend this for someone who is going to leave it on the unit all the time."
3,Could be better,Fits good but windsheild is very distorted.I need to find a way to get the wrinkles out of plastic windsheild.
4,The Kinks get a make over...,"Tough sounding and energetic, One For The Road shows the band's songs reimagined as arena rock anthems. That's not necessarily bad, but they do lose some of their subtly. Still, it's clear that this version of the Kinks (and by version I'm referring to the new, improved hard rockers they had become again) were reclaiming their heritage as one of the first hard rock bands.The concert is, overall, pretty terrific. It is a bit slick, but its slickness is its salvation, particularly compared to some of the sloppy shows the Kinks put on in the early 70's. This album concentrates a bit too much on Low Budget (the album they were promoting at the time) and, as such, doesn't give as much an overview of what the band and Ray's songwriting were capable of doing.All in all, though, I'd recommend it."
5,"Yeah, they overdubbed the hell out of it!!","Having seen these guys a half dozen times, they're an awesome live band. Ray Davies is one of THE great song writers of the 20th century. From the Low Budget tour, this is great rock and roll."
1,Amazing songs reduced to arena rock cliché...,"I was certainly glad that the Kinks had a comeback largely due to the success of this record, but overall, this recording is unlistenable. Sure, it probably was fun to be there at the concert, but listening to the Kinks butcher these songs with all the vocals sounding like Ray is yelling his head off is painful. This is the recording that made me not care if I ever heard Lola again. Enough said."
4,An ideal pairing,"Kenny Barron is simply one of the finest pianists in jazz-- an opinion confirmed by his annual rankings at or near the top of the Downbeat Readers and Critics polls. This record pairs Barron with Brazilian musicians Trio de Paz, one of his students -- flutist Anne Drummond, and percussionist Valtinho.Instead of rehashing the usual Jobim tunes, the record showcases new compositions by Barron and members of the Trio that are rhythmically exciting and offer plenty of space for soloing both on the record and in their live shows (don't miss them if they come your way).Barron is as wonderful as always and the members of Trio de Paz make ideal partners -- especially guitarist Romero Lubambo."
1,Combersome to use and very frustrating,"To make the data recorder work you have to watch a very dim light flash and interpret the flash pattern to know whether it is recording only the GPS, only the HRM, both, or neither. The data recorder can take a long time, and then fail to begin recording, or worse yet, start recording, and then stop unexpectedly. The watch tells you the speed, distance, heart rate, etc, but when you finish your run and try to download the data you find out the recorder stopped mid run. This is very frustrating. If the data recorder worked it would be a great product at a reasonable price, but I can not recommend it."
2,"ordered as a gift, got the wrong item.",Not sure how well it works. It was returned as it was the wrong item.
5,Highly recommend,This is among a dozen classic books to anchor one's search for the fullness of the Holy Spirit. Has impacted thousands of lives. When I went to seminary I was wonderfully surprised to find he was on the faculty since his book had already impacted my life. His class had a unique richness of God's touch.
5,This is for Fans of all ages!,"If you love Baseball, you have to have this set! I watch them over and over again. Even though it depicts Baseball before my time, I feel like I am transported back in time when Baseball was Baseball. I Highly recommend this!"
5,BASEBALL AT ITS BEST,"BASEBALL AT ITS BEST, BASEBALL LOVERS NEED THIS 3PAC VIDEO SHOWING BASEBALL COMING OF AGE. THE GREAT BABE RUTH IN HIS LAST DAYS.WHEN BASEBALL WAS PLAYED FOR THE LOVE OF THE GAME AND NOT FOR THE MONEY...."
5,The Best Baseball Documentary this side of Ken Burns,"This review is for the standard DVD only. Anyone who is a fan of baseball, especially the history of baseball will love this DVD set. Besides some delightful commentary by Bob Costas, (and other voices) there are wonderful shots of many old-time players, many taken by ""home movie cameras"" operated by the ball players themselves. When you get tired of hearing about multi-millionaire players and steroid abusers, just pop in one of these discs and be carried back to a time in baseball's history ""when it was a game,"" back when they did not play to become rich but because of pure and unadulterated love of the game."
4,The friend enjoyed it!,"This was sent directly to a friend as a gift. With his thanks he said that the item (used, as was understood) arrived in a timely manner and in near new condition.Thanks to the sender and to Amazon."
4,Good recording.,"About half of the tracks are free interpretations wich quality varies. The rest of the tracks are simple and beautifull ud playing. I prefer the sound of this recording to Munir Bashir or Deria Turkan recordings. D. Turkan can be very expressive but Munir Bahsir picks a little too strongly on his strings.To resume, the ud played here has a beautifull sound and is played with talent. Don't be put off by a few inferior or just different tracks."
2,Some misguided interculturalism,"Six items on this CD are oud solo pieces and they are nice, melodic and well-played. Particularly the first, inspired by pharaonic music, is a gem. But the ensemble pieces are a bad exemple of Eastern musicians soaking up Western influences and creating an amalgamation that is neither here nor there. These works lack substance and direction and are musically unconvincing."
3,the new technics in arabic bread production,"well , what i'm looking for is the new technics of the arabic bread production in the world , i think that this book will help me of what i'm searching . Please if exist a spanish edition of this book or , if the only one is in english it's ok ."
4,"Clara Schumann, Fanny Mendelssohn, Alma Mahler: Lieder","Clara Schumann, Fanny Mendelssohn, Alma Mahler: Lieder is a 1995 BIS Records AB recording starring soprano Christina Högman and pianist Roland Pontinen. Julius Wender has written the music notes. The booklet also includes short biographies of the performers. The sound quality feels a bit muted. Here we get to hear Clara Schumann, Fanny Mendelssohn-Hensel and Alma Mahler. Recommended. 4/5."
3,Good book for hardball players learning softball.,"I think this would be a very useful book for someone who started with hardball and wanted to change over to play softball. As someone who started with softball, however, I was a little disappointed. I have also read Jahangir Kahn's ""Go Play Squash"" and I thought that book had much better descriptions of the technical aspects of the softball game. For me, too much of Francis' book focused on overcoming hardball habits that I don't have. But the book did contain many useful quotes from professionals about tactics and mental preparation."
1,Beware the quick makeover of a hardball into a softball book,"This is, regrettably, a quick makeover of a good book on hardball squash into barely acceptable book on softball squash. For the beginner, it would be a confusing mixture of the two. For an observer, some of the quotes from pros are revealing as to the gaps between the softball and hardball traditions remaining in the USA. For a more complete guide to the game, get ""Squash Workshop"" by Ian Mackenzie ... or get ""Learn Squash in a Weekend"" for a brief but technically accurate guide. - Ron Beck, publisher squashtalk.com"
5,Entertaining & Accurate,"A great read - and not just for sports fans. Markovits and Hellerman use their topic (the lack of a real soccer culture in the US) to explicate and explore the relationship between America and the rest of the world. For those interested in the development and history of the United State's various sports leagues, OFFSIDE has plenty of accurate facts, references, and resources. For those interested in the more theoretical & sociological aspects of the work, OFFSIDE has a strong and clear outline and plenty of well written, interesting analysis and argument. If you want to understand the social and political role sports play in human culture, OR you want to learn more about American exceptionalism, (and have fun doing it), OR both, read this book!"
4,excellent book,Having read this book eight times I find the book to be of the most immense importance that i am thinking of putting the authors forward for the nobel prize. Outstanding.
2,"Nice theory. Football data inaccurate, though.","I am not sure that the footballing reader will take their arguments too seriously.It is a vaguely entertaining attempt to theorize about 'soccer' and it's place in the American psyche (or lack thereof), but some of the 'facts' used to back up the ramblings are inaccurate, and this results in the book losing some credibility.It was a good attempt, though, to explore an interesting and confounding phenomenon. Perhaps it will spark some interest and a more accurate study will appear as a result."
5,Beautifully made,"We were so pleased with the water glasses we purchased from this same company that we went for the wine glasses to match. We love the uniqueness of each piece. The company is great to work with, if you have any questions or concerns they are quick to get back to you. I'm sure we'll order from them again."
3,Worth it,"Worth it for the brilliant song 'She' alone. (""You thought you were garrisoned; you had all your sides well protected."")""Wistful Fall"", ""Real Life"" and ""Living Room"" are also good, and ""Chocolate,"" as mentioned, is good fun. The others are kind of forgettable but the good spirit of the band shows through and it's a nice Portland time capsule."
1,Lot of Work,"I ordered three of these sprayers and used two of them. They are difficult to use because the trigger mechanism has to little range of motion to produce a good stream. They are usable for small jobs. However, if your spraying task requires a lot of spray, your hand will do a lot of work. It's frustrating to have a large spray bottle that will only spray a tiny amount with each trigger pull."
3,ok spray bottle,"They look and feel sturdy and hold a lot of of fluid; however one of the three broke after ~30-40 sprays. I definitely needed them and am glad i bought them, but i'd try to see if there's some other option if i need more."
4,Works,The only reason I did Not give It 5 stars Is because there Is one more powerful. Until You can get to Walmart and get the sprayer that looks like a Duck that has a foam rubber cover on the trigger this will work just fine. It will go from a mist to a stream for putting Ammonia In then spray flies and fiddle back spiders from across the room.
4,The single you hear on the radio is on the album,Just to clarify some things that this kind messed up on...The single you see on BET and hear on the radio is in fact the one on the album...It's a great song that is accompanied by a great album...Supreme Clientele
3,One of the last good Wu tracks?,You can throw this on at a party with anything and it makes the crowds go wild! Get creative with the acapella and you'll see what I mean. It also rocks the Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band lyrics nicely - takes you back to being a kid in NYC at summertime!!
3,Ghost only out to make a buck,"I bought Supreme Clientele especially for this song. When I heard the whack beat with the same title on the album I knew it was only a matter of time before someone from the Wu would be realesing the single that was not on the album. This has happened to me a few times with Wu Tang music. (A good example that comes to mind is ""your all I need"" by Meth and MJB)Therefore I will NOT be purchasing any more music put out by any members of this group(except for Meth) Unless I hear it first. Cherchez La Ghost is a tight jam that can carry itself. But it shouldn't be realeased as late as it was and it should clearly state that it is a remix. The album version gave me a straight up headache. But the remix version is a classic that we will be bumpin' to for years to come."
2,semi-alright product,The product was not what I thought it was going to be and our dogs really don't play with it. I wouldn't buy another one.
5,Unique,"The gandharvas are truly a unique band. Many people claim that bands have a sound that is different from anyone else, but the gandharvas never sound the same as THEMSELVES from album to album or even song to song. If you are Canadian, chances are you've heard ""The First Day of Spring"" but it is not at all indicative of what this album sounds like. It's really hard to explain or compare their music, so I have to just say go out and buy their albums. If they are no more or not, I am not sure. I have heard rumors both ways, but regardless they are a great band that more people should have taken notice to. In my personal opinion their second album, ""Kicking in the Water"" is the best of their three, but this, the debut album, is great as well. Check them out!"
5,A dark and honest account of the outsider,"Joi Brozek writes with a gripping and inviting style that opens the door into the life of a young woman driven to cut herself in order to feel the world. Brozek's narrative voice is filled with a hells'a'poppin' vitality and fiery energy you don't see much in these ""hip to be apathetic"" days.She's a courageous experimenter yet has a deft and controlled sense of craft tha will draw you in even while it slaps you upside the head. The various threads, plot elements, sub-plots and stream of consciousness whiplash anecdotes all form a complex yet fully-realized single story.Most importantly, she never trades truth for fictionalized drama--here you'll see a raw, honest, sincere, candid, painful, hysterically funny account of a hyper-intelligent and sensitive girl on the edge just reaching out to take you with her.Go now, embrace her."
1,hard to get into,"This book has a wildly complex structure that takes quite a while to begin to understand. Brozek uses some very poetic writing at times but i thought this book fell short of expectations. I had a very hard time getting interested in this book, the characters are interesting but there wasn't anything that made me want to keep reading."
5,Dark and lovely.,"This is one of the rare books about adolescents and mental illness that isn't cloying, smarmy, or obvious in its approach. Joi Brozek has a poet's ear and a painter's eye in describing the world of Lisha, a tormented teenager on Long Island in the late 80s. The ""David Lynchian Brainrack"" (to quote a friend) elements in the book are impressively handled. But what I really responded to was the lack of either sentimentality or cynicism (the latter of which is really just another form of sentimentality). Brozek is wise enough to realize that not everything can be fixed, closure is a myth, our minds play tricks on us...and we have to keep chugging along to our own weird muses. I look forward to reading more from this singularly gifted writer.P.S. It's actually quite funny in a lot of ways, too."
5,gorgeous and fierce,"This book blew me away. It's ferocious, original, weird, and heartbreaking, and written in prose that's both kaleidoscopic and elegantly stripped down. It felt more like an experience than a great read--like going through a war, a love affair, a tragedy. I don't think I've read anything quite like it. Be prepared to be hit right in the heart and gut."
4,A glimpse inside a mind in pain,"This book is a whirlwind, an avalanche, an express train hurtling through the psyche of a teenage girl. Brozek shifts styles fluidly from chapter to chapter, never letting you find a groove, keeping your mind engaged. Each page is a fresh twist of the knife.This is not an easy book to read. If you're looking for quiet contemplation or relaxing escapism, look elsewhere. But if you'd rather find tortured truths, razorblade kisses, and a bomb in the watermelon, look no further."
4,Very Nice,"I must admit, I had a hard time getting into this book at first. After the first two chapters though, it was easy to see just how wonderfully written it is.*Not recommended for young readers who are looking for support when it comes to self-mutilation.*"
1,Awful,"This series is simply awful! Don't waste your money buying this rubbish.The DVD set is presented in the most boring, illogical, and irrelevant fashion imaginable. Most time of each of the presentations is wasted repeating useless details regarding the structure of GED examinations, and very little time is actually taken working example questions. No time whatsoever is spent covering the actual GED syllabus material.I would urge you not to waste your money on this garbage. If you really want to pass the GED well, I'd suggest that you take a look at the Steck-Vaughn books and product line."
4,mama movie,i wish this was on dvd nice old movie about a mothers love for her family i used to watch this with my mother
4,"A good product, created from tragedy","I gather that Stewie the duck is based on a real life Stewie, a boy who tragically drowned. This video was created to honor his memory, and to serve as a gentle lesson for toddlers and their parents. It is brief, but very entertaining for moppets, and might even save a life. The puppets are cute, and I'm glad that I gave a copy to my grandchild."
1,***NOT WHAT'S ADVERTISED***,"This video is 5 minutes long and still manages to be repetative in that time, even to my 4-year-old. It apparently was a promotional item at one time for the Y. I can only guess that the people who wrote great reviews were trying to sell theirs, because there is no other explanation for the great reviews - or the fact that they never mention the length of the video.Save your money."
2,"Sorry guys, not as good as the first one - not reccomended.","This is not as good as the first one. If you've seen the first, which I reccomend, then you've seen the better of the two DVDs. The one had a lot of repetition of the same dunks over and over and even used some of the old tape from the first DVD. The first one had a really innocent approach and this one had a hard edge. Get the first and skip this one. Or get this one if you just want to see a lot of ball tape but don't expect as much as the first."
5,Young Steve,This shows that Steve Earle was at the top of his game before all the self imposed destruction. He left the top and came back to the top. If you are a fan then you should own this. I am not usally fond of live cds/albums but this is one of the few exceptions.
3,"If it's Worth Doing, it's Worth Doing Right...","...but that's not the case here. Steve Earle and the band put on a great show, and fortunately it was recorded, but the sound lacks low end. I suspect the problem is the mastering, and not the recording itself since everything else seems right. This was my first Austin City Limits disc, and it will be my last. There's no excuse for this."
3,Editorial Comments from the Publisher,"Cast: 2m. When Andy Ableson comes to the aid of his brother Milo in the dark, cramped confines of a small cave, the young men have an opportunity to examine the circumstances that slowly drove them apart over the years. As they await rescue, the brothers rediscover the friendship and love that was lost to them and confront the things that truly hold them hostage. Each is trapped in his own way, but who will be set free? This is a powerful play with extraordinary roles for two young men, and it builds to a final breathtaking moment. We highly recommend this young playwright and his unusual play. One simple set."
3,Christmas gift,This is for my almost three year old grandchild - she has played with it at someone's home and enjoyed it.
5,Quite literally a fitness DVD due to popular demand,"The Best of Tamilee is quite literally a fitness DVD due to popular demand. Collecting the best of Exercise Science expert Tamilee's routines from the ""Abs of Steel"", ""Buns of Steel"" and ""Arms of Steel"" videos into one DVD, plus a 15-minute bonus segment from yoga master Stacy McCarthy's ""Yoga Body Lean & Defined"" workout, The Best of Tamilee is an exceptional tour of what targeted workout training can really do for problem areas of one's body. Each of the four 15-minute segments can be done separately or together to suit the viewer's needs, and the only exercise equipment recommended are inexpensive three-pound to five-pound hand weights. Highly recommended. 68 minutes, color."
5,"The Best of Tamilee Buns, Abs & Arms Workout","By far the best butt kicker of all time. Tamilee ditches the leg warmers and 70s hair and steps into the 20th century with the best workout any body can benefit from. I'm 54 and albeit thin, lost my muscle tone. I swear in one week of workouts - every other day - I could see a noticeable difference. If you do the workouts, you will benefit. And, she's fun to workout with. You can also moderate your workout to your level and increase as you go."
4,Surprisingly Challenging,"WOW! My abs were on fire!! I was skeptical at first bying something from the ""buns of steel"" lady but shes great, I really like how her personality shines through like Denise Austin she seems real and I can appreciate that. A great challenge."
4,GOOD BUT SHORT,THE BUNS IS A GREAT WORKOUT BUT THE ABS SEEM RATHER SHORT AND DOESNT DO TO MUCH AND SAME WITH THE ARMS.BUT IF YOU DO ALL 3 YOU WILL BE POURING IN SWEAT...NOT BAD BUT THIS IS NOT THE BEST!
3,Good Workout,"This is a good, but repetitive workout for your buns, abs, and arms. A step is (can be) used for some of the exercises."
5,Best of Tamilee Webb,This is a great workout offering many variations and the bonus yoga is just right to loosen you up!
3,"Best of Tamilee Buns, Abs & Arms Workout","I like the workouts, but the dvd has scratches on it which make the end of the arms workout unusable and the cooldown unusable."
3,Not near as good as the 80's version,"I had the original Ab's of Steel from way back when and lost it! This one has decent workouts, but is not near as good as her original...it seems to be scaled back."
3,Not the best,"This video is good but not the best one of hers. She gives a good overall workout on the video, however I still like the originals better."
3,Not the best,"I've had this DVD for a couple of years and used it on and off during this time and I still can't warm up to it. All three routines just don't have the same zing to them as, say, Tamilee's ""I want that body"" DVD. The exercises are not as challenging, Tamilee herself seems to be subdued and not her usual peppy self, it just doesn't seem right to me.The only good thing about this DVD compared with Tamilee's other workouts is that there is only one set of exercises in each routine - you don't have to do two or three sets of the same exercises within the 15 minute period.I also feel that the DVD would have been better off without the bonus yoga workout. Stacy McCarthy's demeanor throughout the workout is that of a very stern schoolteacher - I felt that she was telling me off rather than instructing me how best to do the moves.Overall I'd pass this DVD and pick up either some of her old workouts now available on DVD or the DVD I mentioned above."
4,Remington Shaver Head,Delivered as promised. The heads are so expensive I could have bought a new shaver for the same price.
3,It's was ok,I have the yellow razor and it isn't quite the same as the original. It works but not as well as the original.
3,They work,"They replaced the old heads on my ancient Remi shaver. Close shave, but irritating to the skin. Have had that problem with irritation since it was new, was hoping the new heads would be better."
3,Decent Replacement for R-950.,The SP 19 replacement heads and cutters were easy to put into my razor. They fit snugly and provide a decent shave. They do not provide as good a shave as the original set that came with the razor. The price was reasonable. Overall I am glad I made this purchase.
5,excellent product,"These heads work great, after my Dad passed last year my Mom gave me his razor rather than toss it out love using it keeps him alive even if only in my mind"
3,maybe it's just me...,"maybe it's just me...I usually rake my face with a Mach 3 and some lye soap... my doctor recommended I try going back to electric shaver, so I got these to replace the heads and blades that have been sitting for years. While it shaved my stubbled facial hair with ease and fairly quickly, it also made my face look as if I'd run it through a wood chipper! Okay, maybe not THAT bad, but I had red streaks, razor burn, and general itchiness. I cleaned the blades and heads, tried again... kept trying for about a week... it's back in the back of the cabinet where it will likely stay forever."
4,Good price and good quality,"This razor replacement fit my Remington R842, even though that model was not listed in the description. It came in an original Remington package and was first rate quality. I will purchase again because of the lower price for the same product elsewhere."
4,Good Product,"This replacement head fit and works just fine. I mention fit, because there is a multitude of different heads for rotary shavers and they all look alike. I spent about a hour online searching and reading reviews before finding the right one thanks to someone's comments that steered me to the one I needed. Prices vary a lot too."
1,Hurts while shaving,This is a terrible product. I was happier with the original shaving heads that came with my 3 year old shaver. The replacement head pulls the hairs without cutting them causing excruciating pain in areas that were missed on previous day's shave. You cannot hope to use the shaver unless shaving is done daily.
1,Remington shaver heads,Finally got the right size for my husbands shaver. They are doing a good job.
5,I brought it is because my remington microflex broked,"After i recieved it and find ou it is to small for my razor, there is a phone number in the back, i can call, next time I feel you need mark the models of the razor"
3,Everything works correctly but….,"I feel the quality of the way this is made is strong but the design did not take to much consideration into the process and requirements of a good shaving head cutters.The cutter blades slotted covers that glide across your face, those three heads have a similar softness to low grit sandpaper.They could have smooth everything out and this would be a 5 star review for the replacement items are all made very well they just did not get the final polish that would have finished the product."
4,02 jeep liberty 2.4l,"Installed it today, it was a perfect fit. I didnt notice and increase in hp or acceleration. although my engine does seem to breathe and sound better. I guess ill see once I hit the highway. Definately worth the money tho, it has a million mile guarantee and requires cleaning ever 50k miles. it also comes with a small decal. ntb."
3,"quirky,funny,and cool","i was about twenty minutes into this when I realized my leg was being pulled. I think what clued me in was the fact that nobody as sweet as Virginia Madsen could talk in such a mean spirited way about her own brother unless she was acting. This movie really is a lot of fun. Don't beleive what you read, dont't believe what you hear, don't believe what you see!"
3,Disappointed,"I was highly disappointed with this cd. With her history of writing big hits with/for the likes of Pink, Destiny's Child, and TLC, I thought I was in for a treat. I was let down bigtime. There were no stand out songs, and her vocals are mediocre at best. I am shocked her label put out of cd that is obviously not her best work. I hope she can do something in the future to rebound from this flop."
4,recently,"i just recently bought this single...as recently as yesterday, and it's pretty good.these are the trax from my single:1. radio edit2. lp version3. hip hop remix4. ear kandi remix5. lp instrumental"
5,Kandi -- such a talented artist!!,"Kandi Burruss, formerly from the R&B supergroup Xscape has proven that she is a talented and strong solo artist. One evidence of this is her single, ""Don't Think I'm Not."" It's a wonderful uptempo pop and R&B song. It's unfortunate that many of the R&B stations have not embraced the single as pop radio stations have. Kandi has exemplified her strong vocal range in this single. Kandi lives up to her name, she is indeed a ""sweet"" artist full of talent. I'm highly impressed of her songwriting talent. I wish her well in her career. It's so hard to find music artists that actually write their own material and have strong vocals on top of that.If you like to dance and have an optimistic and strong attitude to life, than I urge you to pick up the single ""Don't Think I'm Not"" by Atlanta's pride and joy, Kandi.Kandi's ""Don't Think I'm Not"" receives a Kenny rating of A."
1,Let's put it this way....,"This song gets old.... REALLY fast. It's okay the first time you hear it, but then it just gets worse and worse...."
1,Greatest ever? Don't think that's true...,"Kandi is yet another one of those ""Flavors of the month"" singers. She does have singing talent, but if writing is bad, no amount of skill can help...If you enjoy Kandi, you will probably enjoy Syreeta (if you are lucky enough to find any albums by her...)"
4,great scrub!,Dermalogica is great quality....stopped using for years. Don't know why I ever stopped... expensive but it always produces great results consistently!!! I am almost 40 with oily forehead & monthly pms breakouts with resulting hyperpigmentation. I just started dermalogica line again with Chanel le blanc serum with good results. Seller also shipped with high end samples...thanks for the free samples!!! I will be back again 4sure!
5,Made me want to think and eat,"I recently discovered The Books via a sampler CD from a magazine. I was immediately drawn by this fascinating stuff, best enjoyed, in my opinion, through headphones by a focused listener. I suppose it could be considered ambient in the Brian Eno sense that one can invest as little or as much attention to it as one wants. But I found myself fully attentive and working at hearing every little snippet. I heartily recommend this disc to those who are interested in experimental music and it's no-drone zone, y'all."
3,"Half filling, half filler","It's obvious these guys had an affinity for sampling as an art form not found with many knob-twiddlers, creating some highly unique fragments that jump out with spastic glee. But this pastiche fails to sustain itself throughout an entire release, making an intriguingly talented debut merely fall under the curiosities category."
2,over it.,"My super cool indie friend from Chicago told me about this band. I fell in love pretty quickly. Listened to it a ton the first 2-3 weeks of owning it. Told everyone how cool this band was. Spent time on their website thinking about how cool this band was. Stop. Finally it wore off. I was bored of it completely. I had moved on. The album starts off good and pretty much goes down hill after the first 2 songs. Motherless Bastard(track7) is funny, and is worth it just for the intro.Otherwise, I can't think of the last time I felt a desire to listen to this album.Yeah its kinda weird background music good for some situations in life, so I'm not saying don't buy it. Just don't over hype what it is."
3,Eh...,"This is the kind of ""music"" that you are happy enough knowing exists but really don't want to listen to very much. They are too interested in being clever and wind up sounding like John Cage's stepchildren. The ones he adopted and Merce threw out of the loft."
3,Mind Quiz,"Needs better explinations on what some of the ""quizes"" are requiring. Good way to pass some time, although until you get the hang of it and get your speed down, it can make you feel dumb."
4,Great fun for your brain,"This game is a challenge for your brain, and as a 30-something PSP fan, this game takes me back to my high school days - which is not a bad thing. This game is very challenging - but once you get the hang of it, you can be very successful. At that point, the game then becomes a matter of how fast you can press a button, which seems to me to be a measure of reflex as opposed to intelligence. Game will ultimately get repetative but there are many, many types of puzzling questions to figure out in the meantime. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys numbers and math, much like myself. If this does not describe you - then you will likely not enjoy this game."
4,Good Game,"This is a good game. It does have a variety of tests to challenge the mind. It gives you practice tests before taking actual tests. I would recommend, if you like memory tests, some fill-in-the-blank tests, math questions, and tests that time your reactions."
3,TOO DIFFICULT,"The postures were much too difficult for a beginner. I have now taken several yoga classes at a center near my home. Which I enjoy very much, and have learned the postures ""safely"". Yoga requires correct breathing, positioning, etc. which was not, or could not be demonstrated. I needed a ""live"" instructor. Some people may do very well with the written text. I need human interaction! I gave it 3 stars because the information on diet and fasting was interesting."
3,I'VE DONE THE WRONG THING ALL MY LIFE,"This is a cop drama/mystery/thriller?/ spoof? that takes place in the part of Berlin where everyone speaks English. Alex ( Armin Mueller-Stahl) is an old cop that people run away from as if he is a super cop. He has a dry sense of humor to him. While he is hunting a crime boss, a women over doses on heroin. This leads him into the arena of drugs and brothels. He works with an assistant he doesn't initially like which adds to the dry humor.Beck beer and Marlboro Lights product placement. People are heavy smokers, in fact a woman smokes while she is eating soup. There is some jazz detective music, but this is far from anything noir. While the film is not laugh out loud funny, it appears to have some humor we normally find in indie films.The plot is not that great. The dry humor and flashback value would be the reasons to watch it. Also released under the title ""Midnight Cop.""PARENTAL GUIDE: No f-bombs, sexual situations, nudity"
4,A good book for youngsters with scientific needs.,"The experiments are written in a clear way so every reader might understand them; it is a useful text for science fairs projects, and an electric and magnetism demonstrations guide, also. It may be recommended for 6-12 students and teachers, but is a useful tool for parents, too."
1,Depressing,Not very good at all. I didnt realize until i got it that it was from 1988-93. too dark and dreary
5,Definitely helps with pain relief,"Thought I'd give this tea a try since it had such good reviews. I'm not a big fan of hot tea, but this has a strong spearmint taste which is enjoyable. I have been very pleased with the results - much less pain overall and definitely less joint pain after drinking this tea. I make it double strength - 2 tea bags in 8 oz of water and drink it quickly.Great price for this on subscribe and save!"
3,good news bad news,"Although this seemed to work for my creaky knees, it also gave me a bellyache when used according with package directions. Proceed with caution!"
5,My favorite tea,"I am a tea drinker, never liked coffee. I've tried lots and lots of kinds, but yogy Joint comfort is the best tasting. Not sure if it's doing anything for my joints, but it sure tastes good and it's natural."
4,Tasty Tea,"This tea has a nice flavor, although it is hard to say if it is actually increasing my joint comfort. The power of placebo can be just as powerful, if not more so, than any herb or medicine out there."
4,Not in stores,This product I can't find in stores around here. Was at a great price. Tastes great and I love it.
3,"Good Information, Bad Organization","Granted virology is not the most organized branch of science, the author could have done a much better job organizing the information. At many times through out this book I felt lost, not because I didn't understand the information (if you've taken molecular bio virology will be a much easier course) but because I couldn't figure out how this example fit into the big picture. Later on after finishing a couple of chapters I had to go back through my notes, rearrange everything, and add notes to my notes.On the good side, there was a lot of helpful information and background on the experiments used to assertain this information."
2,There are better virology text books!,"I teach at a liberal arts college and I chose this book because the other classically used virology text often feels like information overload, especially for an undergraduate. This book does a good job of keeping it simple and providing representative examples. However, it often leaves you feeling like it's not telling the whole story (an obvious lack of details) AND, even worse, its figures are screwed up time and time again. The 5' and 3' labels are often wrong, and those kind of details need to be the basis for a student's true understanding of virology. The figures need to be completely redone. They contain mistake after mistake. I plan on having my students write up their own comments before the semester is over, and I'm going to add my own list of errors and send them to the authors. I hope that they spend more time on the next edition's figures, as this is just plain sad."
2,Virology Text,"I'm not sure if there is just a shortage of virology textbooks, but this reader, although well supported by cited work, is hardly well-written. The prose of a textbook shouldn't bog the reader down, but confer a good feel of the concepts being presented."
4,Something Different...,"If you educated Nine Inch Nails and gave them Ritilin, you would have Sunna. The truth is, Sunna must be one of the few bands I've had incredible difficulty categorizing. The single ""Power Struggle"" is powerful and hard, and one of my favorites. However, the entire album is very diverse. Tracks like ""Too Much"" and ""One Conditioning"" are very mellow, almost comparable to Massive Attack (Jon Harris actually played bass for Massive Attack on Mezzanine). Then there are simple acoustic tracks like ""7%"" and ""Preoccupation"". Most of these tracks are on the darker, intellectual side- and hold a particular beauty about them, especially ""I Miss"" and ""Forlorn"". This is a band that deserves more recognition than they have received from radio stations and MTV. Unfortunately we live in a Blink 182/ N'Sync world of mindless music without imagination. Bands like Sunna are rare beauties. Also, check out Vast, who I saw with Sunna in the tiniest of tiny clubs last winter."
4,sunna is an interesting new band,i heard power struggle on the radio and it immediately caught my ear.it is a great song and then i listened to the rest of the album and it rocks.i suggest you listen to see if you like it as much as i do.
1,Don't waste your money,"I saw the video for ""I'm not trading"" on MTV2 and I really liked the song. So I looked up the reviews here and seeing that they were really good, I bought the album. BIG mistake. Every other song on the CD ranges from mediocre to lousy. Fifteen bucks for one good song. The rest is crap. Save yourself some bucks...find some idiot like me who bought the CD and record ""I'm Not Trading"" and be done with it."
2,only 2 good songs,"I, too, saw their vid on MTV and was blown away by ""I'm not Trading"". ""Forlorn"" is worthwhile, but all the other songs are either weak (arrangement-wise) and/or downright unlistenably noisy. Skip it."
5,Great for road trips,"I purchased this game for a holiday gift exchange and actually ended up taking it home myself! Remembering that this 9"" size game is meant for travel, it was much nicer than I had anticipated. I admit, I scanned the product description much too fast when I ordered it b/c I missed the bit about the magnetic pieces so I was really excited when I discovered this during play because it doesn't look like all those other magnetic travel games with the bits of metal sticking out of the pieces.I purchased this game in blue and although the lighting in photo makes it look dark (almost black) it really is more blue in person. I would order this game again, but I would have avoided the $7 shipping fee (a total of $28.90 is a bit on the high side) and waiting a few more days with Amazon's super saver free shipping would have been perfect. I guess I'm just too impatient! Overall, this is a very nice travel game and I think you'll like it - I do!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,It was not nearly as durable as one would hope. Flimsy and not put together with good craftsmanship. The pieces are not well magnetized and don't remain on the board. The case looks like cheap vinyl rather than nice leather. Not worth it; wish I'd bought one elsewhere.
4,"Great little board that has the ""feel"" of a full sized game.","This little travel board is great! Half the size of our current folding set, but has the look and (more importantly)feel of a full sized game. Pieces and dice are easily used and having it be magnetic is the best."
2,Meh,"Self indulgent and VERY disappointing. Considering the pedigree of the participants, I expected more. Were two discs necessary? Not really."
5,Ex-XTC Duo Reunited for New Music Experiment,"This is an Reuniting of Andy Partridge (formerly of XTC) and his ex-Keyboard player from XTC, Barry Andrews (who went on to form Shriekback and also League of Gentlemen with Robert Fripp). Wonderful Experimental instrumental music from these two very talented musicians."
2,missing 7 postcards from the book,"truly disappointed at this item, it had seven postcards missing, it would had been OK if this matter was mentioned in the description ...... so embarrassed because it was given has a gift to someone...... don't think would like buying to many other things via you....to late can't send it back....ed centeno"
5,Great book,Thank you Dr ChoThis book gave me a lot of answers. It has opened my eyes to many spiritual truths.
4,A Surprise Ending,"A good WM. I enjoyed the IC, Ramon, tag titles and Luger matches. I also was pleasantly surprised with Hogan winning his final(?) WWF title in an extremly short match. Go get it."
1,When the WWF and the Ringling Brothers combine,"This is bad defined. The WWF knew this was going to suck so they tried to cover up all of the bad matches with a literal circus atmosphere. After roughly 566784389578436504675930754357465743596475475849587 hours of non-action from Giant Gonzales and Undertaker, I was about to go burn down Titan Towers. Wrestling is not a carnival, its wrestling, and the matches count more than anything. They all sucked, except maybe the intercontinental title match."
3,Wrestlemania IX. Review!,"Wrestlemania IX. had somewhat of a silly premise as all the broadcasters have one big ""toga party"" but it does include the WWF debut of Jim Ross. The outdoor setting at Caesar Palace helps make for a good show as well.The WWF Title changes hands twice in one evening as Hulk Hogan returns to challenge the new champion, Yokozuna after his controversial World Title victory over Bret Hart.We also get to see The Undertaker take on the massive Giant Gonzolaez, Crush battles not one but two Doinks, and the undefeated Tatanka takes on Intercontinental Champion, Shawn Michaels who brings out his special guest, Luna Vachon.WRESTLEMANIA IX will best be remembered as one of the most unique Wrestlemanias. While not the best, it sure had its share of great moments."
3,ive seen better wrestlemanias,it was great with brutus and hulk and then hulk winning the world title but the show overall wasnt anything jam packed.
3,WRESTLEMANIA IX-THE WWF GOES ROYAL,"This is perhaps the most underrated WrestleMania there is. The only WrestleMania held outdoors and presented at Caesars Palace. There was royalty galore and plenty of fantastic matches. Although numerous upsets were made, the action was non-stop. Jim Ross made his announcing debut at that event, future WWF superstars were under different names, and the WWF title changed hands twice."
3,ALRIGHT WRESTLEMANIA FOR A MAIN EVENT.,"The main event was the best match of the night with BRET HART VS YOKOZUNA for the championship.ALSO what about the return of HULK HOGAN teaming up with BRUTUS ''THE BARBER BEEFCAKE going up with MONEY Inc.The show was kind of slow but good.For the rest of the cards it was alright with SHAWN MICHAELS,TATANKA AND THE OTHERS WERE NOT REALING GOOD."
1,Trash,"This is not even worthy of a review.The only match is always wanted to see was Bret Hitman Hart vs Ultimate Warrior, and I really hoped in late 92, with the way things were going that a match was on the horizon.Warrior was the number one contender at Summerlslam 1992, and was robbed of the title, and then Bret won it a few weeks later.I would've settled for Hulk Hogan vs Bret Hart and Warrior vs Ric Flair. But in the end we were given a pile of crap.Everymatch sucks. And just when you think it can't suck anymore Hulk Hogan wins the titleEvery match is, at best 3/5, and at worst 1/5, and they are all pretty much 1/5 (Hart vs Yokozuna and Tatanka vs Micheals are the only exceptions)Stay well clear of this circus"
3,Mediocre,"One of the below average Wrestlemania's I've seen. The only standout matches on this program were Bret vs. Yokozuna and Shawn Michaels vs. Tatanka and they both had horrible endings especially Bret's where Hulk Hogan's ego pretty much made this Wrestlemania that much worse. A good key thing for this Wrestlemania was the debut of Jim Ross. I wouldn't mind if Jim Ross, Gorilla Monsoon and Bobby Heenan commentated for this Wrestlemania as it probably would've made this one better."
2,An Afternoon of cheating,"In almost every match the bad guy won cause of cheating. The only thing good about this tape is Bret hart doing a feat similare to raising the dead by carrying Yokozuna to a 3 star match. Then Hulk ""the Ego Maniac"" Hogan decides to ruin the show by winning his 5th wwf title. Most of the other matches are lackluster. Spend your money on one of the 2 WMs before or after this but not this one. If you do watch the show have a barf bag handy for the ending."
2,"lightweight, cheap zipper","Boots are very lightweight and sized okay. I wear a 9 1/2 shoe and size 10 fit with plenty of room. Good treads, warm. Very cheap zipper. Broke very shortly after purchase. Am now trying to punch holes to add a shoelace, grrrr!"
2,Not comfortable,"My wife is not pickey, but she did not like these and I returned them. She said they were uncomfortable."
2,GLTheewis,The boots are not as they appear in the picture. They are very cheaply made. They were inexpensive enough that I decided not to return them because we were leaving to soon on our vacation in the snow that I needed these for. I wouldn't be able to get something else quick enough. I will see how they are in the snow but they feel really weird on your feet. It's like the inside sole isn't set well to the outer sole so when you walk it kinda has a space that pushes downward?? Really strange.
4,of mindfulness and motives,"This is a great book when you want a vacation from modern life; you'll slow down and will have a renewed appreciation for quieter and slower moments.However, it's not one of those touchy-feely, ""don't I feel better now"" reads. He challenges, not just our view of contemporary, mobile society, but our thoughts on the absolutes of Christianity. It's a keeper in my home library, right along side the Amish books and various religious studies and texts. Worth the time for Christian and non alike."
3,Admirable but left something to be desired,Mr. Savage does a good job in describing his chosen life of simplicity and reflection however I guess I wanted him to inspire me to work toward something similar but he didn't. He seemed a bit preoccupied with himself and unable to reach out beyond himself.The book was easy on the eye and the brain and perhaps I expected something of a challenge although it was interesting to read his descriptions of the horse and buggy lifestyle.
4,A walker's perspective on A Plain Life,"I picked up a Plain Life because I am a long distance walker, not because I am interested in the Amish 'Friends' lifestyle, but in spite of that fact. Even though Plain Life was heavy on the walker's religious political background, Mr. Savage did in fact deliver what he promised in his title and his first few pages. And, again, from a walker's point of view, if we are to identify with the walker and what drives him to walk half way across Ohio, we need to know who he is. I agree with those who say he seems naive about the world. But that is who he is. Is this naivete worse than cynicism, or greed, upward mobility, or kicking ass in the business world? I recommended this book as a brief and informative peek into the life of someone who is unique, among a cult of those who are, themselves,different."
5,Plainly inspiring...,"Both ""A Plain Life"" and ""The Plain Reader"" are eloquent guides written on the road of simplicity and faith. Wise, soulful and humble in presentation, they will cause you to reflect upon your own life and that which you hold dear. I highly recommend both of these titles with appreciation to Mr. Savage for sharing his reflections in such a meaningful and profound manner..."
4,This read brought a quiet peace to my soul,"What an excellent peek into a life transformed. I so enjoyed spending time with Mr. Savage on his trek into deeper simplicity. Often in my reading of this book I considered my own life's focus and the ""chase"" I seem to be caught up in, and I was challenged to shift toward pursuits more wholesome and meaningful.A book well worth the read...if for no other reason than the quieting effect it has on the soul."
4,Excellent product,I've used this plug in thermostat for about 8 months now for both heaters and air conditioners. The programming is straightforward. I will be purchasing a second unit soon. I highly recommend it as a great cost saving measure. The only drawback is that it does not seem to recognize past midnight on Sunday as weekday programming. I assume weekday programming kicks in at the first Monday interval.
4,Works fine with one limitation,"As with other LUX products(sometimes available in selected models under the ACE Hardware house brand), they are pretty reliable. The only kink I can think of is it's pre-programming does not allow past 11.45pm shut off and only starts at 6.00am. The programmers at LUX tend to forget there are 'night-owls' out there or people who stay up late for whatever reason to work or play. I have another whole house Lux thermostat that has the same limitation. A numerical punch button manual programming (for whatever time you want )feature will be ideal in this instance."
5,Accurate temp control,"I am using this in my 12x16 shop. For heat, I am using a cheap oil radiator heater. Without this thermostat, the shop would either be 80 degrees, or 50! The thermostat on the heater was junk. This thermostat fixed that problem. My shop is now a steady 60 degrees, and it has cut down the use of electricity as well. I would buy this product again."
5,I envisioned this thing and was happy to find it existed!,"I use this for an oil/electric rad near where I sleep.I don't use the timer but rather just switch it off when I wake.I would recommend adding degrees Celsius for us Canadians, preferably in at least 1/10 of a degree.Still I feel that in the spring and fall and times when you are running the real furnace, this thing should easily deliver savings."
1,worked for 2 days,"This worked for 2 days, then wouldn't turn the device on it was connected to. This was a waste of money."
5,Works fine,"We have been using this in the garage for a month or two and it works fine. Accurate temperature, at least according to the other thermometer in the garage."
2,"Works well enough, not terribly useful for very cold weather.","This unit's lower limit is 45 degrees F, so it's not especially useful for activation at lower temperatures (which is the primary reason it was purchased). If that was stated anywhere in the specifications, I missed it. Otherwise, it's pretty much the same programming as a programmable thermostat."
2,Worked for a while then quit,"Got it all set up and it worked for a month but then stopped working. I haven't had time to tinker with it more than a couple of hours to figure out why. Fortunately, my chickens didn't fry before I noticed."
1,Way too complicated...,"This unit is way too complicated, it does everything but the simple functions I needed. If it does what I need, I couldn't figure it out because the instructions are very difficult to understand."
4,wish it had a backlit display,"This outlet has saved me from forgetting to shut down my electric heater, so it has been a valuable purchase for me. I just wish it had a backlit display when adjusting the programmable thermostat."
2,Not quite cheaply made,"I had one burn up under warranty below rated amperage. Read the manual carefully, but they are fantastic electric wall heater thermos."
2,Save your money,"Does not seem to work as it was intended to work, once the appliance turned off, it did not come back on"
4,does what I want it to do,"It does what I want it to do. Easy to configure and maintain. Also, it does the job well enough."
5,Works Great!,We bought this thermostat about a month ago and we are very happy with it. I would definitely buy another one if I had the need.
3,Does not fully work as recommended with dimplex electric stove,"I would have rated it excellent, but I ordered it for the dimplex CS1205 electric fireplace stove(no built in thermostat included) in order to control the temperature. It was recommended by Amazon that I purchase this with the stove. It works great, however when it shuts off the heater at my set temperature, it also shuts off the flame. This should be mentioned in the recommendation because it does not work like other electric stoves with a built in thermostat that leave the flame on for ambiance."
4,so far so good,I read the reviews saying this product was prone to failure. The application I have this in is cutting on an exaust fan in a cabinet to keep from having too much heat buildup. So far it has kicked in at about 77 deg when set at 75 and kicked off at 73 2 deg plus or minus is close enough for my application.
4,Exactly what I needed,This was exactly what I needed. I was using it for the Chameleon cage. Late at night it gets cold near the cage (it's near a window) and I wanted this to turn on the ceramic heater for the lizard when the temp dips below 65 degrees. Much cheaper than any of the reptile supply places. Great buy!
4,Should have bought this ages ago,This thermostat works great. I just setup my times / temperatures and plug the heater in. Now when I come home from work my room is nice and toasty. It drops down at night and then back up in the morning when I wake. It just works couldn't ask for anything more.
2,Failed in 5 days,"I had a space heater plugged into this thermostat. One of my biggest fears was the thermostat would malfunction and 'lock' in the on position thus heating up the room toasty. My fear came true. Luckily I left the door open to the baby room that night, and it didn't get toasty, but if the door was shut, it would have been mid 80's in the room.The LED display displayed ""LO"" in the screen, and the buttons were not responding to anything the morning it was 'locked' on. If the battery was dying (which they were not, I tested them with a volt meter) it would display 'LO BATT'. Pushing the reset button also did nothing. Don't know if it was a fluke, or plain ol' bad luck, but this item isn't trustworthy enough for what I was using it for."
5,Retro fit an old A/C,This is the only product I found to convert your old A/C from a twist dial thermostadt to digital energy efficient opperation. My A/C now works just like the new ones without replacing it and without retrofitting the opening for a new one.
5,Amazing device,"I bought one of these thermostats to use with a Dimplex Electric Stove CS1205. Absolutely amazing temperature control! The stove is either on or off, high or low. With the thermostat, it controls turning it on and offf instead of me getting up in the night to do it. I am purchasing another one for a heater in another room. It's easy to program this device, and the override makes it easy to adjust for guests who need it a little warmer/cooler. Truly a money saving device. I expect the two thermostats will pay for themselves this winter alone. This would make a nice gift for those with on/off heaters and air conditioners."
2,buy it,"I had to edit this review since the thermostat broke, the unit does not turn off. After resetting it works as it should through one cycle then fails to shut the appliance off, good thing I checked, cost me a fortune in electricity though. All I wanted was a simple cooling, line voltage thermostat for a greenhouse, I got this for about the same price. It comes loaded with features, it will make you wish you got more, unless it fails to work. You can roughly set the offset temperature too which adds to the versatility of the thermostat, this too does not work as it should, would be good if it did. I can now buy a large inexpensive space heater and set it to heat whenever I want without having to touch it, in theory. It has been two months since got it, I noticed the problem, tried to fix it by setting and resetting the unit, now it is too late to return it. Amazon won't seem to take it back. Five stars if it worked."
1,didn't work as i was hoping for.,"product work great until it got cold, in the ten's. it frozen up and turn the heater off that was warm the water tank, so what happen when a 300 gal water tank stop getting heat well as we all know water frezzes. cost a lot of money to fix a busted tank."
4,It does what it's supposed to do,"I bought this thermostat to control a heater on our enclosed back porch and it did exactly what it was supposed to do-control the off/on cycles appropriate to the temperature. I did have a problem with the first unit I received, but the company's customer service was excellent with their response and replaced the unit without any further problems."
4,Happy Homebrewer,"I use this to control the temperature in my fermentation box. Works really well to control heating pads in the winter and refrigeration in the summer. I saw another post about the temperature differential not working. That may be true, I can't really tell, but it doesn't affect my application."
2,Died in less than a year,Very dissapointed that it seems to have died in less than a year. Worked great while it worked. It was a great idea but didn't last as long as something this price should.
4,Very nice piece of equipment,"Was very pleased with the accuracy of this devise installed it on a Wall heat in family-room temperature stays at 68 where Ive set it,Very nice piece of equipment"
4,Lux WIN100 Smart Temp Fully Programmable Thermostat,great product have it connected to heater. works great and very satisfied with your service.
1,Terrible,"Would not work from the start. When I plugged this unit in, the display went crazy. Never did recover. Non usable. Would have given less than 1 star, but cant"
2,Great little thermostat.... When it doesn't get stuck!,"Set this sucker up in the attic to control a heat exhaust fan (about a 100 watt turbine 740CFM fan motor). Running an extension cord to a regular power outlet, everything worked great for a week or two. Now, the thing gets ""stuck"" at night and refuses to turn off until I climb up and manually override the temperature setting up or down and then it suddenly realizes ""oh, its no longer 80 degrees"" and shuts off. Very annoying. Would be great if it worked 100% of the time. Since Im over my 30 days return policy time I'll probably just buy a cheap timer to plug it into; that will only allow it to have juice between 7am-9pm or something like that; that way if its still running at 9pm (when I KNOW for a fact that attic has dropped to the outside temperature) then it will have a failsafe to shut it off in the event it decides it wants to run all night.As it works - 2 starsIf it worked all the time - 4 starsGood luck with yours."
2,Not for use with hotel style ac,Double check your ac unit before ordering. Will not work with hotel style ac units that are 240 watt. Not a bad setup just doesn't work with all ac units.
3,temperature controll for econo wall mount heaters,"I love the heaters as they are very efficient and with their wall mount, a low profile, so great for small rooms. The only issue was that they only turn on and off. This temparature controll made it work great. It's a little complicated to figure out how to set it but once you do it works great."
4,It works !,"Not much to really say about the device other than ""it works"". The settings for the hysteresis feature are vague and take some playing with to get set for your own preferences. Other than that, it's a good device for that old air conditioner or heater that either doesn't have a thermostat or has a thermostat that just doesn't work the way you want it to work."
5,thermostat review,Product did what it was supposed to do and has worked ever since. Seems to be a great way to solve the electric fireplace control problem.
5,WIN WIN DE-LUX,I wondered how long it would be before somebody made EXACTLY what I've been looking for...for years. EXCELLENT thoughtful design. STOP WASTING ELECTRICITY with this amazing device!
5,Perfect companion,"This Outlet Thermostat is the perfect companion for space heaters and such. We use a heater in a small 'sun room' so we can use the space early in the morning. In the winter here the room is quite cool. None of the small space heaters on the market have this programability built in, so adding this outlet with its full complement of programming options has been a God-send. Now when we go out in to that room in the morning it is already warmed up. The rest of the day and night it is held at 60F so plants don't die.A great product. But not available in Canadian stores yet.??"
5,Great thermostat,"This programmable thermostat works great. After I have the program entered I can flip the switch to ""on"" when I'm using the room where I have the thermostat installed, or flip the switch to ""off"" when the room isn't in use. Works great for what I wanted."
5,A must have with any generic space heater!!!,"Saves a lot of energy buy using its built in thermostat to control room temp. No more guess work, and hot/cold rooms.Also works for AC in the summer!!!"
1,There's a problem with this unit when temps go over 100 degrees,"My unit is set to turn on a fan in my shed at 90 degrees (then of course off if goes below that), but if the temperature of my shed happens to go over 100 degrees during the day, it will never turn the fan off when the temp goes below 90. I had LUX exchange my first unit, but the replacement acts exactly the same. So now I have a 24 hr timer that powers the LUX unit ON in the morning and OFF in the evening, otherwise the fan would run continuously. So the unit has been nearly useless to me. They definitely have a technical problem with this unit and am quite surprised it hasn't been fixed yet."
1,Lux Win100 Thermostat,"I purchased this thermostat for a small heater in my dog heater, it was easy to program, it worked great for a weekand then it stopped turning the heater off and on, display was still showing, but it didn't control."
2,Good idea but needs better engineering/design,"These are a great idea but the design/engineering is poor. The thermostat only extends about an inch. This is a problem since the unit (and then the thermostat) heats up when switched on. The result is that the thermostat reads high when it turns the heater on causing it to turn off the heater while the room is still well below the desired temperature. It will eventually stabilize to the desired temperature but the reason someone would use a thermostat is to conserve energy by allowing the room to cool when not occupied. To make this work it is desirable to have the room heat up quickly.The manufacturer should re-design the thermostat to accurately detect the room temperature, if the company has any designers/engineers (may be just re-packaging a product purchased from over-seas manufacturers???)"
4,Almost a FIVE!!!,"This is absolutely the most sophisticated general-use plug-in thermostat I have ever seen --- we have two of them. (We use a LUX programmable for our heat and central air, too --- superb!)ONLY ""complaint"" --- the sensor is hard-mounted to the case. If you use an electric heater next to a cold wall --- well, you can see the problem: the sensor is down there near the floor, and next to that wall.IF they had made this with a micro-socket and a sensor with a long lead, I would have given it SIX STARS.I'm not necessarily ""recommending"" that you do anything like this, but it really isn't too hard to disconnect the sensor and wire in a long lead. One, say, that reaches from a chilly-toed wife's night table to the thermostat on the other side of the room ..."
5,lux win100,I don't know what this thermostat was intended for but it was easy to take apart and extend the cord on probe. that was a plusi was disappointed that it only went to 90 degrees but nothing on amazon is fully described. when the read out say 90 my dairy thermometer says 95 i don't know is that is because i extended the cord or what but it is well made and seems reliable.
4,"Great product... one small ""issue""","This thermostat does a great job of keeping our bedroom and living room at a comfortable temperature. It was very easy to program. My only issue with it is that the temp sensor sits very close to the wall. If you have poorly insulated exterior walls, as I do, the cool air will ""trick"" the thermostat into thinking the room is cold and will keep the heater on. I had it set to 68 and the temp in the middle of the room was about 75. I simply lowered the thermostat a few degrees to correct for this. If you have well insulated walls this shouldn't be an issue."
5,WIN100 Heating & Cooling Programmable Outlet Thermostat by Lux,I use this thermostat to control the temperature in my entertainment cabinet. I connected the AC outlet of the thermostat to a power strip and plugged in two fans (one AC and one 12V with an an AC adapter) to the strip. The fans come on when the set temperature is reached to cool the cabinet. It works like a charm.
5,LUX WIN100,I bought two of these for a dog house I built for my dog. One runs the heat and the other the airconditioner. They work very well. I highly recomend them.
5,Excellent Fermentation Chamber Controller,"I purchased the Lux Win100 several months ago. I purchased a used refrigerator off CL and mounted the Lux Win100 in the door. I have an extension cord running from the wall, through a hole in the door insulation, and into the Win100. I then have the plug for the refrigerator running in through another hole and plugging into the Win100. Works like a champ and for $40 cheaper then a Johnson controller! Will keep two 5 gallon glass carboys within 1-2 degrees of ideal temp."
4,Wonderful programmable thermostat which makes it possible to use cheap space heaters,"Pros:-Ability to program detailed weekday/weekend temperature settings-Accurate temperature sensor-Easy to program/use-Nice quick temperature override featureCons:-bulky, may eat up another power outlet next to it-hard to read display which does not light upRecommended!"
2,Worked brilliantly for one night only,The truth is I liked this device a lot for one night. The temperature in my bedroom that night was consistent and I slept soundly. I left the space heater running the whole next day with this device controlling it. The 2nd night I was awoken by the relays clicking on and off every couple seconds. I finally had to give up and shut off the space heater and risk getting cold. I spent the whole next day testing the programming and replacing batteries but the relays still don't stay on so I'm returning it for a full refund. It's not worth playing the game of returning and replacing until I get one that works. I just want to be warm and healthy so I'm buying one that costs almost twice as much. Hopefully that works out.If it had worked it would have been great. It was easy to program and simple to install. It's cheap so it might be worth gambling and trying out. I wish you luck if you choose to get one.
5,Great Product,"Works great. Using it for my wood stove fan. When stove cools off over night the fan shuts off preventing the it from blowing cold air around. Once the temp. gets hot enough, the fan turns back on."
3,"Good idea, diffenential adjustment does not work.","I like the idea of these thermostats, we do not have central air and have four window units in our northern home, which we get by with. The thermostats (I have four of them) have a tempeture differential adjustment of 1 to 9 degrees. Guess what, it does not work on any of the four units, so with a 1 degree set (it dosen't change even when you put on 9 degrees) are snapping on and off all the time. This is not so much of a problem during the day, but at night in bedrooms it is a problem. To bad all these units have the flaw, they are a good idea.Rich, up north for the summer."
4,So Far So Good,Was very easy to program and is meeting my needs so far. But I will need to update this in the spring as the winter will be the real test
3,to soon to tell,"just received it today, got it programmed, feels and looks sturdy so we shall see, if it lasts being made in china"
3,"Great Idea, But","it seems they've changed the product so that the instructions now require the heater to have a three-pronged grounded plug in order for it to work. Purchased this for a Soleus Mica Panel heater, but it will only work if used with an extension cord, which gets very warm. Others seem to have had luck plugging the heater in directly, but this is not the case for me.Not sure about the safety of using this with an extension cord or power strip rated for 1500 watts, even though the specs should be able to handle the heater load."
5,thermostat,Exactly what I wanted and excellent product. I am thinking about buying another for my portable space heater in the shop.thanks
3,It works but it changes its mind,"I bought this thinking ""set it and forget it"" but it has a lot more settings than just a simple on at this temp off at that one. It goes by day of the week, etc. and personally for me: I don't care what day of the week it is if I'm cold."
5,Great way to keep the baby room warm,"We bought this to regulate a ceramic heater for the baby room. Before this, we used a timer that worked okay except the temperature fluctuated depending on ambient. This unit is easy to set, has weekday/weekend modes and keeps the room at the most comfortable temperature for our baby. It is also easy to move around with the heater in case the baby needs to sleep in our room for any reason.The rest of the house can be 68F during the night but the baby room is always 72F."
3,A decent album,"This is probably Trick Daddy's best album considering all his others were below average.The best songs on here are Play No Games,Thug Holiday,In Da Wind and a few others.Some of the songs are basically garbage and I think we could've done without the skits.I can't believe this is Tricks 5th album already"
1,TRICK DADDY HAS LEFT THE BUILDING,Don't expect this album to be any good. All of the songs sound alike and are boring. Just skip this and buy something better than this filthy music.
1,"come on, trick, what happened?","ok, tricks first cd ... had some tight joints like ""Nanh"", his second cd had that good joint, and his third cd, ""Thugs R Us"" had TAKE IT TO DA HOUSE and I'M A THUG which were both good so what happened? When i heard IN DA WIND i thought even though i hated there might be some tight tracks on it, at least enough to be worth the $19.99 i paid for it. well, it wasn't..."
2,Typical Hollywood portrayal of the military,"As usual, this Hollywood movie depicts the military like a bunch of bozos who just want to shoot the first thing they see. It was all pretty ridiculous, with North Korea ready to launch an ""IBCM"" from within a roped-off area being guarded by two guys with a couple of guns."
3,wasn't bad,"Like all movies the first one is the best same goes with the ""Behind Enemy Lines"" the first is the best the rest go down hill."
3,Behind Enemy Lines II (DVD),"Movie was okay, but had different actors and characters. Didn't really have a tie in to the original movie, but it stands up fairly well on it's own."
2,Tom Rothman is cheap,"Rothman greenlighted lower budget films at Fox seeems to becoming more of a habit these days. This movie looks like it was put together on only a $3 million dollar budget, Not so much a feature film, more like a made for cable movie with very little to offer, some of the actors in this deserve better roles then this drek."
1,"This is hard to look at, gives me a headache.","They use that stupid constant camera jerking around fake action so you can't even watch a scene in it. Poor plot, poor acting, waste of time."
2,Ok at best,"I wasn't totally disappointed in this movie. I guess the ""timliness"" of the plot kept my interest longer. The previously reviewed camera shaking complaints were also noticeable by me and and bothersome. However, I was more troubled by the color. It seemed, in order to separate the different plot themes, there was a different color tint in the filmed segments. The political powers all had more of a yellow tint, the scenes in North Korea had more of a blue/darker tint, etc. Maybe my machine was just farting, but, this was aggravating. Did anyone else notice this???Truthfully, you get what you paid for. I should have rented this one."
1,Missing Item,"I still have not recieved the item and I ordered it over a month ago. Everything else that I have ordered with it and after it has arrived, while this has not."
4,"Great production,great vocals,great lyrics,great album!!!","The one and only Michael Kiske has a very good album here with Instant Clarity. Highlights here are ""Be True To Yourself"", ""Somebody Somewhere"",""Thanx A Lot!"",and ""So Sick"". Actually my favorites will probably change and there is not a bad song on here(no fillers!!) so please check this one out. It is a diverse collection of songs from the cool ballad ""Always"" to rock songs like ""Hunted"". For Helloween fans out there(aren't we all) this album comes close to the song ""We Got The Right"" from Keeper Of The Seven Keys part 2 but really this is one album that stands on it's own. Now if we could only get the price down a bit on these imports!!!!"
4,An enjoyable and light read,"This is a brief primer on the field of information architecture (which Morville has written a much longer, and dryer, book about). It breezes through topic after topic with light examples and colorful images, referring to major works along the way that you can look into if something grabs your interest. Don't expect to find enlightenment here, or concrete tips for improving your website's design. But you'll enjoy some wide-ranging stories of how search technologies are changing our information landscape."
1,"I am very interested in this kind of topic, BUT could not get into this","This felt like a long college senior thesis. Rambling, unfocused and without real-world applicability."
3,Expectations color ealuations,"I first saw this book at my local public library, and the title hooked me.I had to read it. I read it, and I'm glad I did. It is entertaining andthought provoking. It also has a lot of problems.I thought the book was important enough that I should review it, but I hadtrouble organizing my thoughts so I decided to take a chance and look at thereviews. I'm glad I did. Those that are considering reading it for contentshould consider the reviews. I found most of them to be accurate and reasonable.Your opinion of the book is likely to depend on what you expected to find in it.Read some of the raves and some of the pans."
3,Didn't find what I was looking for,"I bought ""Ambient Findability"" looking for (1) insights into how people search for and find desired information and (2) tips on how to make web-based information easier for people to find. It turns other that the book doesn't focus much on either of these issues.The title, ""Ambient Findability,"" is somewhat misleading. The book is a lot like listening to a thought leader (which Morville is) holding court on a variety of topics tangentially related to findability. You get a broad-ranging set of Morville's musings, many of them interesting, that fall all over the map. I would have appreciated knowing that before I bought the book. Unfortunately for me, there wasn't a lot of meaningful advice on making information more readily findable. I noted a few good references, but that was about it."
2,Techno navel-gazing,"I get the feeling this could be one of those books people look back on 5-10 years from now and ask ""Did we actually think this was the direction technology was going?"" It's always risky writing about the future of technology, so credit to the author for giving it a try. I'm just cautious of academic-type books that consistently have to invent words to make their point (e.g. findability, everyware, wayfinding). The book is written well and interesting in parts (hence no 1 star rating), but not nearly as interesting or useful as the author's Information Architecture book (hence no 3+ rating)."
3,"Too much terrain, too little time?","This is a book that I keep coming back to. There are significant pearls but you have to dig hard to find them. It is not clear that the abstract ideas could not have been presented with more clarity, but I suspect that perhaps that is the case.This book could use an interactive website where the abstractness could have been explored with more concrete practical examples. Yeah, it is not a ""how to"" book, but ideas need to be grounded so that they can be more readily understood.Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend the book, but I am withholding the fourth ""*"" star because I tend to agree with other reviewers that there is something lacking. The book is extremely useful and disappointing at the same."
4,textbook,"It's a textbook, so it's not enjoyable, but it's well-formatted and presented, so I can't complain. Plus, it's well-written. So."
3,"Shallow and sophmoric, but overall a good introduction to web navigation","Covers too much ground and leaves you wanting more. Not particularly useful in itself, but readable and will help you think about the problems. What there is is more useful for extremely large sites and the Web itself.Also a pretty good set of references, but would be better if they had been gathered together in a notes or references section at the end, as it is all references are only in footnotes, so you might want to jot down page numbers of references you want to check on as you go."
1,This DVD is in Spanish,Not sure what else to say. Buyer beware if you are not able to speak or understand spanish. There is no warning this title is not in english.
3,great music.... but it gets kinda monotonous,"I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy this album, but there is a such a persistence of tone that I got listless before the CD finished. I would say this album is great for people for who like to be thoroughly depressed. Sounds a little like Matthew Good Band, and throw in some Sebadoh."
5,one more of many to come,"Another great record by John Frusciante and Josh Klinghoffer. This time around he recorded this effort in a span of 5 days and the finished peice is raw yet beautiful. This album marks the first in a series of albums to be released in the upcoming months. When John made 'Shadows Collide with People' he said how he wanted to prove people wrong about saying he couldnt make a album that wasn't messed up (i.e. Niandra LaDes and Smile From the Streets you Hold). He came through with a wonderful ""production"" record. On 'The Will to Death' the songs are stripped, but easy to listen to, and a pleasure to hear. This is a must for any Frusciante fan and a great album by a very gifted songwriter."
2,not sure what to say,As much as I love her pictures I do not think the DVD gives her justice. After having seen it 2-3 times I think it will stay in the shelf for a while. Worth seeing but don't buy it in a rush
2,The CIA sabotaged their own invasion,"The authors fail to notice the most important thing the official report itself reveals, namely the real plan of the CIA, which was to sabotage their own invasion, making sure that it would fail, and sandbag JFK into a full-scale invasion. My argument (proof, I think) for this thesis has been available on the net (""The Bay of Pigs Revisited"") since it was written in the mid-90s, and it is also in my book ""Looking for the Enemy,"" an early version of which was also available in the late 90s."
3,It is a very good book but it didn't tell the hole story.,the book Bay of Pigs Declassifieied is very good it don't have quit all the facts in that it don't say one word about the small unit of guerrillas that I was in charge of we worked behind the lines to clear and hold a landing spot for troops that never came. the hole unite was captured and all but my self was killed including my interpter a young Cuban girl code name Louise she died so bravely she saved many lives by not telling where some of them were. I have tried to find some of her family and friends. but being short on money and not realy knowing where to look makes it all most imposable. she also saved my life and I would like to see her name in some of the books about the BAY OF PIGS INVASION
2,Nothing new,"I loved the book, really nothing new in it I felt from the last one, you got a new sticker, and a cd showing a shim, (a woman or man) talking to someone. I didn't get my free screensaver and all that stuff that was suppose to be there, when I contacted the publisher, they told me to contact Amazon."
4,This is what I ordered for my Addonics player second,"I have this basic brand of DVD decoder at home, though not the Gold version. This may or may not give you multilingual support, though it seems to work okay with Region 2 discs. Unfortunately, it is less precise than PowerDVD. I ordered this second when the seller of PowerDVD gave me a refund because he was having trouble accepting orders at the moment. As good as it is, PowerDVD is slightly better."
1,Shipping fiasco,I want to preface this by saying the gummies themselves are great and if that's what you're looking for I would go with the Haribo brand any day. The issue I have is with the shipping. I placed the order over 9 days ago and it still has not even left their facility (THERE ISN'T EVEN A SHIPPING LABEL PRINTED FOR IT YET) add that to the fact that these are only about 5 cents cheaper per pack than buying in the store (factor in shipping and you're paying more). Their response has been total silence (no reply to e-mails at all) I used to live by amazon but now i really think i will need to rethink my vendor of choice.
1,boxex and product cut,the boxes that the items came in were cut open with a box cutter.some of the gummie and avicakes were cut open. threw out whole order since i dont know what was opened and what wasn't. amazon wont let me leave feed back on the gummies so im forced to put it here.
3,Alphabet candy,Candy was slightly hard/stale. Not fresh and soft. Packaging was cute. Kids played with the letters but did not eat many if them.
5,Really Noce,It was much bigger than I expected so for this price it was a great deal. My cockatoo loves it alot. She keeps swinging on it more than her regular perch swing.
5,Excellent CD,"This CD is awesome. Cormega is a talented artist. His lyrics have a message and he doesn't swear just for the sake of swearing and doesn't rap about women and drugs. Some of my favorite songs are Verbal Graffiti, The True Meaning, and Endangered Species. A must have for anyone who likes real rap."
1,Over-rated,"He bit the real king of QB; Nas, all out in the album, and all he talked about was Nas, just so he could sell some records. Not worth the 15 bucks"
5,VERY VERY VERY GOOD,"I can't compare this and the Realness because they're both very different, and very good. This one Mega reveals maturity and wisdom rather than street law (The Realness)...I recommend it to anyone who listens to Hip Hop music."
4,4.5 Stars...Queens Finest...,Cormega is no longer in the shadow of Nas. This is the follow up to his classic debut. Cormega is smarter than most MC's because he understands a tight beat when he hears it. The production and lyrical content are both above average and gives Cormega more street glory to brag about...
4,almost perfect,"Don't sleep on MEGA. His last album 'The Realness' was great. This new album is even better and the best that Mega has put out thus far. Classic Hip Hop, from start to finish, filters through the speakers. Lyrics---whoa. Production---whoa. And Large Professor's verse is ill too. Get this album ASAP. All true hip hop fans will not sleep well at night without this album in their collection."
3,Pretty good Album,"There are som real good joints on here like 'Verbal Graffiti' and 'Soul Food'. Though, it lacks a cerain edge that ""The Realness"" had, and I find it weird that he has beef with Nas, while alot of the songs sound like they were taken right out of Illmatic or even Stillmatic. None less, he has a harder image than Nas, which is cool, but I really think the two of them need to get together and do a collab album, that would be amazing."
2,OK album,"Its no Illmatic, or even The Lost Tapes, but there are a few hot joints like Soul food and Verbal Graffiti. If you like Mega, you will still probably like it."
3,Beware!!,"""Celebrity All-Star Jam"" does NOT mean real celebrities!! These are not the original artists. If that's not a big deal to you, then it's not a bad cd."
1,Don't rent this...,"This is not a film, but a lame concatenation of still photographs. I am very dissatisfied, and if it weren't such a piddling amount, I would ask for a refund..."
5,Magical Material Here,"I have over 10 of Kalevi Aho's CDs, and in most of his works, at least in many places, he finds ways of being quite magically inventive. The trombone concerto, the so-called Symphony No. 9, is a case in point, and perhaps my favorite of all his works. One hears ideas, sometimes rather radical, never heard before; enchanting, yet crafted to a degree that it is hard to imagine them other than inevitable. Still, they remain fresh and clever on repeated hearings.It's an exciting ride - all the more so because trombone soloist extraordinaire, Christian Lindberg, has what must be an impossible part (except for him!). There is a real ""gallop"", the breathtaking presto of the first movement. The use of full register (and then some) required in the upward lines that start the second movement. Louder dense passages that lead to a peaceful, evocative, and sublime suspension. And the trombone ""vocalizations"" of the third movement. Wonderful stuff all. Neat!"
3,Not a bad collection,"Forget the ""confidential"" rubric and just relish this assortment of short films. You won't find any secret Operation Market Gardens here, just a quick succession of bombing raids, dogfights, POWs -- even an offbeat segment about a master sergeant who came up with several clever time-saving innovations for which he won the Legion of Merit. The quality varies considerably, but well worth the price."
3,Battlefield films,Very interesting battlefield films of World War II. A WW II Buff will enjoy this DVD. I found it very interesting and in many ways informative of what our military went through.
3,short shorts,athentic film/ would have been more interesting if each title were longer but what can be bouth for the price/.
2,TWEETERS TOO HEAVY,I have a truck and the speakers were so heavy that they could'nt be mounted to the door.
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Before you but this, know what you are getting. It is made of brass plated very thin sheet metal. I bought it to hold kindling and its ok for that, but I can't see it strong enough to hold logs. You get what you pay for.........spent more money and get something more substantial."
4,very good 1st release,"heard about this band through andy partridge's website and i thought i'd give it a try. i was immediately blown away by the jangly guitars, the great harmonies, the great pop song structures that actually reminded me of later-era XTC (go figure!).there are a number of great songs on this record and i highly recommend it.cheers."
5,The 80's Zepplin,"I was introduced to their music back in the 80's and i loved them. Their music was a staple to any party we had. Over time, the tape i had of thiers got lost,which was a major bummer for me. The past few years i searched and searched for their CD and came to nothing but dead ends. So when i finaly did find thier CD, i was totaly stoked. Now that i have it, i am gonna guard it with my life. I just wish the 80's rock would make it's come back, cuz like many others we are waiting with baited breath."
1,Only if you're a CISCO KID completist!,"Hey, I bought this because as a collector it was the only CISCO KID sound feature I didn't have in my video library. I like Smits as an actor and a good friend story-boarded the first 25 minutes of the film. As CISCO it just doesn't work for me. Why do film makers insist on reinventing everything?! As a film, the first 25 minutes are good, but that's no reason to recommend this CISCO to anyone. When Laser discs were the way to collect films, I had it. When I got rid of Laser when DVD took over, I always figured it would be released in this format sooner or later. Nope...never happened. So, I acquired a VHS copy from one of Amazon's ""partners"" and burnt it to DVD for my archives. It was an excellent copy of an ordinary and ultimately disappointing made for TV feature. What can I say. Loved the price and dealer service but can only ""sell"" the movie to die hard collectors. 'Nuff said."
1,not too happy,"For $20, I was not expecting this to be a DVD copy. The picture quality was too dark. I thought I was buying a NEW Dvd"
5,The Vampire Women Strike Back,"Not really a direct sequel to 1962's classic SANTO VS, THE VAMPIRE WOMEN, THE VENGENCE OF THE VAMPIRE WOMEN explores many of the same themes with the results we love. Beautiful full color transfer with English subtitles, gorgeous Gina Romand as the vampire queen and Santo doing what he does best - winning in and out of the ring. A real treat for all Santo fans and a good entry for those who want to find out what ""Mexican Masked Wrestler & Monster"" movies are all about."
4,Clarity on Review from Publisher's Weekly,"Just a sidenote on the reference to Hinduism and Sikhism. Sikhism is a sect of Hinduism. According to wikipedia ""As used in the Constitution of India, the word ""Hindu"" is also attributed to all persons professing any Indian religion (i.e. Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism or Sikhism)."" Sikhism is to Hinduism as Methodist is to Christianity.Hope that helps"
1,don't bother,"Poorly researched, poorly argued, and poorly written, this book does not repay the effort required to read it."
4,"Great song, repetitive remixes","I love the original melody and lyrics on the song Jumpin', Jumpin', but most of the remixes on this disc tend to sound alike after a minute or 10. However, a great reason to buy this single is the live rendition of Upside Down, which goes on just a tad too long, but is nevertheless excellent."
1,"Jumpin, Jumpin, Junk","Why don't they just take this song on a Jumpin, Jumpin jaunt to the junkyard. Listen to ""JUMP UP"" on the DR. NO Soundtrack if you want to jump and hear some really good music."
3,Not Horrible,Now looking back it was not that terrible infact it might have even good but I hated them with pure passion I hated them I did.Lyrics 7/10 Production 6/10 Overall 6.5/10
2,did farrah sing at all????????,"Her lips moved, her body moved, her hair moved, but where in the world was the sound????????????????????????"
4,Set it and forget it .,I bought this product and i think it does a great job of cooking chicken wings and pork loins. It does get hot quick and we use it a lot more than we thought we would. I found that with a steel wool pad you can clean it quick and the video tape was very helpful on how to use it properly. I purchased the rib rack optionaly and cant wait to use it also. I think for small meals for one or 2 people this is the way to go.
3,Ugh,Did not receive the squewers (sp) and after several emails later and about a year later they gave me a refund on the price I paid. Since they wouldn't respond very often or evr get a replacement part in. Otherwise it is great.
4,"Brings back memories of wine in Slidell, LA","We spent some good times talking with Ronnie at his home on Bayou Liberty. Hearing his music of the vines brings back fond memories of the finest place in the world - Slidell, LA. Ronnie's most amazing creation was his rendition of Amazing Grace that he orchestrated and played for Pope John Paul at a mass at University of New Orleans. Play on, Ronnie! Dave Curry"
2,One False Move,"I received this book from a friend who gave up on it. I should have trusted her judgment. I hate to write a bad review of a book which someone has spent a lot of time and energy on but because I found this book so frustrating, I decided to do so. For some reason Ms. Sauter couldn't keep her train of thought and the plot going in the same direction. It was like someone with ADD. She jumped from place to place and all of a sudden in the middle of the book she introduced a new concept which made absolutely no sense to the story line. Amazon has a lot of terrific books to offer serious readers, my recommendation is you try some others. There will be no movie from this one."
2,One False Move,"One False Move is what I made when I bought this book. The description sounded interesting and the reviews enticing. Sadly, this book was a huge disappointment. The plot (what there was of one) went off in so many directions, with characters who were both poorly drawn and uninteresting, that I quickly became frustrated and lost interest. No amount of research which Ms. Sauter obviously did when writing the book can make up for poor writing."
4,The metamorphosis of an icon.,An excellent tome of information and to be recommended to anyone interested in the evolution of Ducati's 8 valve models from both a UK and USA perspective. To read gives an understanding of how an anachronism of a peculiar 90degree V twin came to dominate the WSB series despite an annual dilution of the initially favourable rules.
1,"Really bad footage of nothing, can be seen on youtube.","Theres some grainy kamikaze footage and ALOT of soldiers marching/pacific footage. Very little axis footage and very little fighting footage. Search WW2 German Color Footage or WW2 American on youtube if you want to see better footage, this was a waste of money and I wouldnt watch if someone gave to me for free."
4,Excellent video very fast shipping,I received this video very soon after I ordered it. The quality was better than I anticipated. Great bargain.
2,Not pleased,"I thought this would be the same series I watch on the military channel, sadly it is not. Personally i'm not very satisfied with the product at all, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The only reason it received the 2 stars i'm giving it, is the price for what I paid (7.99)."
4,Excelente !,"Ótimo video da 2 World War, realmente excelente e focado num duro conflito entre naes to distantes e que muito influiu para a situao mundial atual"
3,Decent tool..but there are better,"Decent quick adjustable pliers for the price. Knipex make the ones to beat and Irwin just does not have the same quality. the GrooveLocks are quicker to use but not the same high quality as a pair of Channel locks. Quality has gone downhill since they took the brandnames Vice-grip, Irwin, etc and re-formed overseas, lock stock and barrel.My set had a scrape/chip on the lip of the plier. Not enough to hassle with a return, but annoying."
4,"Very good quality, and we use them for many jobs.","I bought these for my husband for Father's Day. He was very happy with my choice. They are some of the ""special tools"" that he has with him his his Blazer all the time."
5,Irwin Industrial Tools 2078709 GrooveLock Chamshell Pliers Set,A great Christmas gift. These looked to be well made and just what my nephew wanted for working on his equipment on the farm.
5,Outstanding pliers that have provided years of reliable service,"I have the larger set of pliers available in this combo pack; I purchased it several years ago when I was performing bathroom renovations. The tool has held up well and proven itself to be remarkably useful, and it has terrific bite- it really gives you a strong, reliable grip on just about anything, even things that are oftentimes slippery (like smooth, straight pipes). The build quality is fantastic, and the handles provide excellent traction in your hand, so you can really get at whatever you're working on.What I love about the Irwin pliers is the way that you adjust them. There is a large, round button that you depress, and then the opening can be smoothly adjusted to whatever gap you desire. To me, this seems to work really well when selecting just the right size, as opposed to the traditional method by which groovelock-style pliers are adjusted."
2,"Get it if you're a ""completist""","As a Deb Talan fan, I bought this CD to get a feel for her earlier work. Her voice is amazing as always, but frankly the album as a whole is unremarkable. I'd even call a couple of songs pretty bad. But it's worth a listen anyway, and I'd still recommend giving it a shot if you're he sort who likes to collect everything you can by your favorite artists."
3,Disappointed grandmother,"I bought this for my 3 year old grandson's birthday after comparing other ""mini-motos"" and ride-on battery powered cars. I selected this one because it seemed the safest even though it was about $25.00 more than others. Amazon shows the list price at close to $500.00, which has to be a joke. The description states it has a SAFETY BELT. No it does not, nor does it make ""real engine throttle sounds"". It is all made of molded plastic. You could buy something like this all day long at ToysRUs and avoid the $20.00 shipping charges, plus about $30.00 cheaper.However, my little grandson loved it. It was just the right size for him. It does NOT work on grass hardly at all, and you must use the driveway, hardwood floors, or the sidewalk.Still, I could have gotten him the same thing at ToysRUs."
4,Epson GT 15000 Excellent,"Purchased this scanner used and got a great deal online, I did have some issues installing the software on window 7 OS, it worked on one machine without issues, tried to use on another pc with same OS, but could never get the software to work, the speed is fantasic as well as the results, it has a large bed which is reason I purchased it to scan 11x14 items, additionally it's very fast, I recommend this scanner for purchase."
5,So much great information in this book,"I actually like Wall Street Money Machine-Stock Market Miracles even better than WSMM#1. So much great information. Covered calls, options on stock splits, rolling stocks, naked puts, naked calls and covered puts.Behind closed doors was an interesting chapter.If you want to make money n the market, buy this book."
5,Demystified option trading for me,"Before buying this great book by the great Wade Cook, I knew nothing about trading, the stock market and thought options was a choice on which stock to buy. WADE COOK helped demystify the whole darn thing for me. Trading became easy, fun and very profitable. Even without knowing what I was doing completely, I was able to make 200%-1000% annualized returns.This book is different than Wall Street Money Machine VOL 1. It covers trading much more completely. Another winner from Wade."
5,Another super book by the Wadester,"I bought the original ""Stock Market Miracles"" back in 1998, loaned it out but never got it back.This is essentially the same book, only revised with new charts and some new info.This book goes deeper into buying and selling puts than Wall Street Money Machine No.1 and complements that volume very well.Forget the negative reviews about Wade. Where were these people prior to 1994? Wade popularized cash flowing the stock market, in particular ""rollng stocks"" and ""options on stock splits: The techniques work. Great book."
1,His horrible teaching is the only cashflow he has left!,"I got turned on to this guy, he has charisma. That is about it. He is under investigation by numerous people. His stocks for his own company are down to 18 cents. You buying this book is the only thing keeping him afloat. Go to ""thestreet.com"" and look him up in a search on their site if you don't believe me!"
1,Don't waiste money on this BOOK. It made me mad.,"I got angry while reading the book, because in 75% of this book he tries to sell his seminar. There is only about 25% information in the book. You can find that information online. Plus, his detail isn't very good, because he refers to his other books. I guess he is trying to sell those, too. He talks about his formula, but never reveals it. You have to go to a seminar, which he no longer has. This is not a book for beginers in the market. Also, it is way outdated for 2008/2009 and after.All you need to do is look up rolling stocks, puts, and options, Find the definitions for them and see what other investors recommend."
1,There are better books. Avoid this one.,Wade Cook material and books are questionable at best. Avoid any books where shills are raving with 5 stars. Cook is a great money but it is your money you are spending for his questinable advice.
5,Don't waste your money indeed by,"not buying this book and following the proven srategies. Wade never made a dime in the market, that is true---as an educated quess he made millions. In 2002 Wade made over 22% in his account when the market was down.I wonder how much Wade's bashers made?"
3,"Rocky start, smooth finish","I saw this concert in Windsor, Ontario, and Jann had the same sound problems with the opening song that night, as she does on this live recording from Vancouver. The mix is way off in spots, and the vocals are all but lost just pass the three minute mark. Why this wasn't corrected in post-production is even more troublesome. Jann is much better than this recording, and buyers deserve better quality for the hefty $[money] pricetag. Fortunately things get much better quickly, and the rest of the release is very good. Great entertainment for fans and newcomers."
1,Shut Up and Sing Jann!! Way Too Much Talking - Brutal Attempt at Comedy,"Would get 5 stars for the songs which are spectacular but the between song banter is brutal, childish and just awful -- your worst nightmare at amatuer night at open mike night at the comedy theater -- terrible and totally ruins the CD!!"
3,diamonds in the rough,"I am deeply interested in what it means to follow Jesus so I was excited to find this offering by Charlie Peacock, a songwriter and artist for whom I have great respect.I agree with so much of the content of this book, but was turned off by the rambling, dusty way he covered some of the material that's been covered to many, so many, many times before.However, I found many of the insights and suggestions in the later chapters stunningly on-target. So, if I could recommend to you chapters 11-19 as incredibly good, and suggest you skim the first half of the book I would. This book would have benefited from some judicious editing. By only eliminating 40% of the content it would be a 5 out of 5."
2,"Mush! Mush, puppies!","Charlie used to be a great songwriter. Listen to his first five albums if you don't believe me.But who told him he should write books? His theologibabble (for some reason he rejects terms like ""Christian,"" ""disciple,"" or ""believer"" in favor of ""student-follower of Jesus"") is annoying, and his tedious way of developing his points tends to weaken rather than strengthen them. He spends a lot of ink rhapsodizing about the importance of story and very little actually telling stories. My advice, seriously: read chapter 1 and then skip chapters 2 through 7 ... they're not worth your trouble. The rest of the book has a few interesting spots, but on the whole it just doesn't hold my attention. Heck, I just finished a 400-page book about a volcano that was more engaging than New Way to Be Human."
4,Jan Jelinek - Kosmischer Pitch,"Jan Jelinek continues his unique brand of loop-based with KOSMISCHER PITCH, although his new album leans more towards the ambient side -- the rhythms are much more subdued. The opening track, ""Universal Band Silhouette,"" draws on accumulating post-rock guitar layers, while ""Lemminge und Lurchen Inc."" has a more icy electronic feel. Certainly, this album isn't as immediate as his previous works, but the drones of ""Im Diskodickicht"" and ""Morphing Leadgitarre Ruckwarts"" provide lulling beauty. ""Western Mimikry"" winds back and forth, mimicking nothing of the sort, but ""Lithiummelodie 1"" sounds more like a country-western, although filtered through the glitchy Jelinek we're used to, complete with record hiss and cut-and-paste guitar strumming. It's a new direction for Jelinek, one that's not entirely unwelcome."
2,steering wheel puller,Tool advertised as being able pull steering wheels on all late model GM & Chrysler Cars. Ordered for use on 1999 Buick Regal. None of the bolts fit the steering wheel. Had to jury rig with bolts and nuts not provided.
4,Intriguing,"Not exactly sure what to take from this book versus other, more occult-oriented readings based almost entirely on Christian mysticism and other mystery religions yet the tie between science and the occult, perhaps, this book explores adds a unique perspective to my personal library. In short, a very interesting, good book yet not sure where it ""fits"" although reads somewhat similar to books have read on government research of remote viewing - science mixed with mysticism with a stronger emphasis, perhaps, on the empirical."
4,Good price,"Thebattery itself is veri good product, but the main reason to buy it was the price. Even with S&H still is a steal.The only diference was that on the picture was posted batery with JAPAN cell, but the real one is with CHINA cell... Still is worth it."
2,battery is marginal,"I never had luck with this. The company sent out another, when the first one I got wouldn't charge. Well the next one charged and still does, but I have to charge it every day and sometimes twice. Y'know like the song...... santa claus is coming to town. ...He's got a cell phone, charging it twice, gotta talk to clients who's naughty or nice."
1,bad battery NO STARS!,"It nearly fried my phone and didn't work. It was about 15 days trying to figure out if it was the battery or my phone and it took several weeks for my phone to work normally with the old battery. It was an authentic battery according to Motorola but it was either old, bad to begin with, or a returned battery that got back into the retail stream. The seller was very good working with me and refunding promptly. I got a generic one at the mall at a store beginning with R and second word beginning with S that had the battery on sale and it worked great."
4,Just what I needed,"This battery was just what I needed. We have two Motorola V276 phones, both of which were getting old. The original batteries would only last a day or so on standby. With this new battery I can go almost a full week on standby without any trouble. Fits right, works right, problem solved."
2,ONLY GOT HALF MY MONEY'S WORTH,"One of the two batteries is either a lemon, or was ""used"" and they didn't tellme about it, because it will not hold a charge. It shows ""fully charged"" andthen dies after five minutes if I'm talking on the phone. This happened seve-ral times , so it wasn't a problem of it not charging fully the first try. The otherbattery that came with it thankfully is all right.It seems then that the one good battery I bought cost me double. I will ne-ver again buy from that seller.If Amazon stands by its merchants, you should at least notify them of thisreview and challenge them to do something about it. I will not bother to con-tact them, as I'm sure they don't give a damn. They got their money.Carlos R. Garcia"
5,Great Battery and Cooperative Seller,The battery is great and they went out of their way to ensure that I was satisfied with my purchase. I would definitely buy from them again!
5,Excellent from start to finish,"Everything was wonderful, from the product to packing and shipping and receiving in a prompt manner. Would do business with this company again and again. The price was very fair as well, couldn't do better any where else."
1,Not an academic study of aging at all,"We used this book for a class on aging. As compared with another textbook on aging, this book doesn't really even talk about aging. It focuses exclusively on multiculturalism, and is certainly interesting, but should not be used for an academic class on aging. It doesn not contain scientific research or even theories, but opinions about obscure topics. If not for an academic class, it would be fine to read just for the interest of multicultural issues, but even then only if you've got time to waste. Marginally interesting, not a valid book for a text in class."
4,One Thing Missing!,"""Finally"", put out by Atl.'s Attic Crew is just about everything you could expect from the A-doubleT-I-C, but there is an important part of the crew missing. Due to the of the dissolving of LaFace Records (which most of the members and groups that make up the Attic Crew where signed under), having to release ""Finally"" independently, Youngbloodz being signed to Arista Records, and other problems; Youngbloodz could not get cleared to be on any of the songs. Some bonuses are the appearances of T.I.P. on the Attic Crew's (non Youngbloodz havin') version of ""Dope Boy Fresh"", Jim Crow, and basically all of the rest of the Attic Crew. The lyrics are tight, the beats are on point, and the content has real substance. The only reason I gave ""Finally"" 4 stars instead of the highest rating, is because the Attic Crew's headliners, Youngbloodz, should have been on the CD, no matter how long it took. (Now you know why it's called ""Finally""!)"
5,Instrumental electronic rock at its best,"I first saw the Octopus Project as an opening band for Trail of Dead in D.C., and I was instantly hooked. Their catchy, instrumental songs got stuck in my head and finally I broke down and bought this album. I wasn't disappointed in the least. If you're a fan of experimental post-rock along the lines of Broken Social Scene, you definitely should check this band out."
3,A good start but...,"After loving their new album, Hello Avalanche, I was very eager to get their first album to see how they began. First the good. There some excellent jams, rhythms, and riffs throughout the album. It ranges from laid back to frenetic paces. Overall it's a lot of fun. The bad? The song writing. Although you can here the genius behind the musicians, at this point they hadn't figured out how to turn that into 4 minute songs. Many compositions here meander aimlessly or stay stuck on one riff too long. Another distraction is their deliberate attempt to be ""lo-fi"". Too much on purpose noise infiltrates the mix. At one point I thought my speaker was blown. Nope, just a ""cool"" sound effect. One song would be great if it weren't for the incessant cymbal hiss masking the great work beneath it.I wanted to love this album. Instead it was an interesting and promising beginning for Octopus Project. But ultimately, get Hello Avalanche and enjoy their unique mix of music and pass on this one."
2,Books Provides Stories but Little Help,I found the book talkedd about situations where boundaries were needed yet did not contain helpful information about setting boundaries.
2,"""In the head...""","Whitfield seems to spend his time gathering and dispensing (via word regurgitation) his information. While it is useful, it's far from friendly reading. Move on..."
3,Boundaries,I started reading this book with hope to deal with my mother and bounaries. I have a 9th grade reading level so it was over my head and I couldn't get into it. I am sure it will be good for you. the otherr thing is that I wish I had known it was on a kindle. It might have been better to read.
3,Too much waffle,"It's longwinded and while it has some interesting insights,it's very poor on actually setting boundaries.Look for something else if you want to set boundaries.Disappointing."
3,"The material presented is great, but lousy writing.","The material presented by Whitfield is really good. I'm sure it will help many people. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to be able to decide whether he's writing to an academic audience or to people seeking self-help.If this book was re-written as a self help guidebook or an academic textbook, it would be much better. Right now, it seems like it doesn't serve either audience particularly well."
3,"""The topic of today's lecture is Boundaries.""","Whitfield's basic text on boundaries was useful to me as a springboard to other more readable books on the subject. His writing tended to be dry and pedantic. I found myself getting irritated at all the charts and tables, which I don't find helpful in elucidating psychological dynamics ... but then, different people learn in different ways. After awhile, I found myself reading the most pithy portions of the narrative and skipping the rest."
1,Not a good musical CD,"I have both his CDs and if you like that fast guitar playing, It's okay. But, I think he's faking it! Vai, Satch and Yngwie are not musicians and this CD was a total waste of money.I listened to it once and I sold them!"
5,OUT OF THIS WORLD SPEED.,"michael angelo of nitro released this album in 1995,when instrumental guitar music wasn,t exactly popular and he doesn,t make it commercial in the least.its crammed full of impossibly fast shred which is to fast too say.still i find the instrumentals rather well composed,and i can listen too them over and over.no boundaries is a extremely brilliant progressive rock instrumental and the other songs aint bad either and while there may be some unnessecery shred ,i think he uses his speed wisely.anyway a great over the top shred classic.BUY ITif ya can find it that is..."
2,"NOT the fastest, and boring.","The fastest guitarist accolade goes to Herman Li (Lee) from a power metal band called Dragonforce. He makes Angelo look average and plays so fast that you will think that there is a fault with your CD player. It is all so boring, power for the cause, tasteless playing that says so little musically."
4,Guitar at the speed of light....literally,"The first thing you will think when you hear this cd is whether or not this guy is really playing. I am a fan of stuff like Yngwie, Paul Gilbert, etc. but this guy plays so fast it sounds like a machine. The style is quite different from Yngwie...think Satriani at 500 mph. Personally, I prefer the neoclassical sound, but he has some good songs on here such as Jam Game. Definitely for any fan of fast, technically astounding guitar work. This and Michael Romeo's Dark Chapter represent the fastest guitar work I have ever heard. To get a copy, go to angelo.com."
3,Not totally functional,"I must say it is wonderful to be able to use a spiral notebook without contorting my hand, but it defeats a lot of the purpose when you put it into a three-ring binder and you can't use it while it is actually IN the binder. A valiant effort but it still isn't quite right. (er, left...)"
4,Very Well Done,"These two movies are very well done and entertaining. I purchased the set after seeing the first half of Jane Eyre on PBS, then not being able to see the second half---I didn't want to miss it! And I wasn't sorry. If you are unfamiliar with the stories, beware, they are somewhat darker than your typical love stories."
3,Disappointed,"I can only rate this as a 3 star simply because the version of Wuthering Heights was disappointing. Jane Erye is absolutely wonderful and enjoy the ""extras"" that are included. I'm not convinced that the purchase was worth the ""extras."" I will never watch the Wuthering Heights again."
2,Wuthering Heights too brutal for my taste,"I purchased this collection for the added features of Jane Eyre that the previous DVD of this 2006 Masterpiece Theatre presentation lacked. Otherwise, not sure I could even give it one star. Admittedly, I've read Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre several times but have never read Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. But, after viewing the DVD of this story, I would never want to. Since when does selfishness and possessiveness pass for love? That is not love. Preventing a mother bird from feeding her babies is not love. Hanging a dog is not love. If you want to watch a compelling and beautiful love story, stick to Jane Eyre and spare yourself the wretched and depressing story that is Wuthering Heights."
2,2.5 Stars,If you're thinking of picking up a Haystak album DO NOT pick up Return Of The Mak Million. It is pre-recorded material that his label released. Pick up The Natural or Car Fulla White Boys. NOT RECOMMENDED.
3,pretty nyce..,yo..u should cop this cd from a akron rapper...this city is on the rise foreal..no doubt...holla!
3,Okay songs,This Cd is a basic Cd of some of the songs of the 60's artists and bands. And otherwise has some pretty goods songs. Enjoy![...]
4,The WHOLE story,"Sassinak on its own is a pretty good story, but there are a few holes in it, and it doesn't seem finished... Almost like it is just a chapter in a bigger book.Well it is. To get the whole story you need to read: The Death Of Sleep by Anne McCaffery and Jody Lynn Nye followed by Dinosaur Planet and Dinousar Planet Survivors, both by Anne McCaffery. Then Sassinak and finaly Generation Warriors. (Also by Anne McCaffery and Elizabeth Moon.)That way you can read the WHILE story, starting with the first time Lunzie gets shipwrecked till they all save the known universe, almost by accident. You'll have to read the books to see how they do it! The books are all tied together and you get to see some of the same scenes from different points of view.They are well worth the time to read."
2,Ok for young readers,I enjoyed reading this book when I was in high school. As an adult I'm a bit more picky with my reading. But as a teenager I thought it was a good space opera.
1,mega authors in publishing shame scandal!,"How Mccaffrey and Moon didn't die from embarrassment when this was published I'll never know. Perhaps they didn't actually read it? Perhaps the editors just relied on the wonderful reputations of the authors and didn't actually read it? I recommend you do the same and don't actually read it. Pick any book in the Honor Harrington series instead if you wish to see how this story should have been written. Note to self: once your reputation is made as a mega author, you can make money from publishing eclectic drivel."
2,McCaffrey's done better stuff...,"This book was quite a disappointment after being brought up on McCaffrey's excellent Pern series. I expected something a bit more moving then *this*...at best, a rather bland muddle of confused conspiracies and an unlikable heroine.I don't know how much to pin on Moon - but I have heard that she's done excellent military books, so it's possible that the book's greatest strength can be attributed to her. While it failed to stir me in any way, the book does present a semi-realistic view of the military in the future. Hurrah. However, where the book goes astray is when the authors try to have it both ways - I have no problem with hard science-fiction, but when soft sci-fi sensibilities are mixed in with it - ugh.In short, save your money and go for some other stuff. This is not their top work."
1,Simply Horrid,"Unreadable. I'd recommend if you were a particular masochist, but otherwise - go and enjoy dental surgery, it would be far more pleasurable and constructive than reading this book."
2,Disappointed,"I've read most of Elizabeth Moon's books, and consider myself a fan. This is the first time I've been disappointed. Poorly developed characters, goofy relationship with her ancestor, annoying ending. I have no intention of reading any of the other books in this series."
4,Overall good,"I rather enjoyed the book. 2 of my favortie authors have teamed up, and it's overall quite good.I did not like that we 'glossed over' several sections of Sassinak's life, particularly her years of captivity."
3,Entertaining,"It is as entertaining read, but, it often felt like I had mistakenly skipped large areas, and a re-read showed I had not. Maybe a 2-author problem? More characterisation would have been nice as well. (Moon fan)."
1,blah,"i used to like anne mccaffrey, but that was when she could WRITE. this book was so boring, I couldn't even get through it."
2,Sassinak,"This book is of the type you read when there is nothing else available and someone gave it to you. The holes in the plot are wide enough for spaceships to fly through, and it shows McCaffrey's often-seen tendency to not follow through a logical sequence. Moon actually can write military s-f of the softer sort with better plotting than this. Read any (ALL!) of her Heris Serrano or Esmay Suiza books to find out how this sort of thing should be done."
2,A waste of paper,"To be frank: this book is an example of what happens when you take science fiction and surgically remove all vestiges of a)plot, and b)talent. Truly a horrible book"
1,I should have listened to other reviews,"Even though I had read some reviews regarding this book which were not very favorable, I bought the book anyway for the mere reason I had read Sand's ""Renegade Hunter"" and ""Single White Vampire"" both of which I liked. I was very disappointed in Bite Me if You Can. There was no romance whatsoever. Each page I turned, I was hoping for a tease....but it did not come.....still page turning until 3/4 of the book had been read and nothing! Like most books, the author teases us with sexual desire. This book did not even do that! There was no teasing, no love, no romance, and.....no sexual desires like other books written by Cole, Lara Adrian, Gena Showalter. It was a complete waste of money and reading time. Next time I will pay more attention to what others write."
2,"Worst of the Series, Skip it.","I picked up this book because it was the next in the series. I loved the other books, the characters were funny, had the 3 dimensional feel you love to get with books. Boy was this book a let down big time. Lucian was so uncaring, so 2 dimensional, I found myself falling asleep at times. And poor Leigh had to be shackled with him. And this is suppose to be a romance book. Ok where's the romance? You don't get to the romantic parts until almost page 292. The book was very plodding, boring and yet it felt like the author slapped this book together at the last minute and called it good. I call it bad. Hopefully the next book will be better, perhaps with Thomas as the main character. Now that would make for one yummy book. I do give credit where credit is due and say Lynsay Sands is a good author and I won't let one sour apple wreck my enjoyment of the rest of her series."
5,Bite Me if You Can,"I loved it!!! It's sexy, humorous and alot of action. It's very entertaining. I recommend this book and the whole series. Lynsay Sands is a great author."
4,Hooked on the Series but miss the humor,"I liked Bite Me If You Can, but like the previous entry in the series, Sands is getting more and more serious. I miss the wacky humor of the earlier entries."
1,stilted and boring,"I have read this book and one other in this series by Lynsay Sands. I hoped this would be an improvement. It was not.Sands' writing is plodding, and she spells out everything in a pedestrian manner. By the end of this book you will have read several pointless descriptions of the dog going out to pee, and if you should happen to not know what ""he raised his eyebrows"" means, don't worry, because Sands will follow that statement by telling you ""he was surprised - he did not expect that.""Whatever conflict there is in this book takes place on 5 pages, and is completely uninteresting.This book was completely dry and flat. I picked it up at an airport because I am a bit of a fan of the genre, but you really have to tread carefully there. I would recommend instead for those interested in modern-world vampires/supernatural books that you try Kim Harrison, Kelley Armstrong, or Jim Butcher."
4,good,"i like lynsay sands books very much. she has a great sense of humor. I enjoyed this book as well but I did not laugh out loud, like I have reading her other books. While there where some amusing actions, I felt there was something missing. don't keep this review from trying her books because she is definately a gifted writer. Her books are on my keeper shelf. I guess what I am saying is that some of her other books showcase her talent better."
1,Awfully boring,"I couldn't get myself to read this book. I couldn't read more of twenty pages before I got bored and put the book down with no intention whatsoever of ever picking it up again. In fct, I'm hopping I can return it to the library I bought it from.Sorry to offend fans or the writter herself, but this book wasn't for me, definitely."
2,ramadan,"i didn't like this book that much. i guess i didnt become part of it eough but if you wanna know about sacred dimensions in native american life you can read black elk speaks or something, it's better, like reading soul on ice instead of some dude writing about eldridge cleaver, it's not that complicated there's little need for a metaphor"
4,Great Shirt...Sizes run big,Great shirt! I got the medium and it seems a bit big...just so all you know...but a good one to have
4,Ahmad Jamal Does it Again!,"The second of two releases entitled 'Essence', this is another high quality album from one of the most enduring pianists of the second half of the 20th century. I first heard him when his recordings made Top 40 billing - e.g. 'Poinciana'and made a point of hearing him play live in new York in 1983. I guess you could say I like his work. This album is no exception. Other Jamal fans will enjoy his mature work as displayed here."
2,did not last,"When using on impact gun, 1/2 to 3/8 broke immediately. :( Guess you can't expect more. Was a waist of time... Don't waist your time!"
2,not what I expected!,"I heard the drovers in the ""blink"" movie & I loved that mix of rock, irish trad. with guitar ,bass ,drums + violin & trombone. I bought this cd thinking I'd find the same kind of spirit. The sound on this cd is overdone in an 80'sway & the music is a kind of mix between the pogues & the waterboys...So if you like those bands you should love this , if you've just seen ""Blink"" & are looking for that crazy ness & sound you felt in the movie, this cd just won't do..."
4,great music - even better live show!,"I just saw this band last night and they were incredible!!! I could've listened to them all night long. Vocals were impressive, but the instrumentals were better than anything I've seen since an evening in the late '70s with a little band called the Grateful Dead. How this band has escaped the bigtime is a mystery to me."
2,Not worth the whole album,"The Knife are great, I love them. But there are really only 4 good songs on this particular album (Heartbeats, You Take My Breath Away to name two). Quite disappointing. You're better off buying a few of the individual MP3 songs for a buck each. The rest of the songs are just ""fillers"". Deep Cuts is not as good as a whole as their other albums. So, save a few bucks!"
2,dull edge,"I loved two songs on this CD and pretty much can't stand the rest. Maybe its an acquired taste. I wish I would have gotten this CD free from a friend, then I wouldn't feel so salty about forking over my cash for something that's not so hot. BEWARE!"
4,Stylisé et différent,"D'habitude, aucun groupe avec le son des années 80 ne me plat. Ici, c'est différent. C'est rafrachissant d'entendre de la musique différente de tout ce qui se joue à la radio. Tantt dramatique, tantt ludique, la musique électronique de The Knife est passionnante à écouter."
3,not as good as Silent Shout but still worth listening,"Nothing beats Silent Shout (an album with no bad tracks in my opinion and one of my favorite albums ever), but there are some great cuts on this album (Heartbeats, 3 remixes of tracks, You Make Me Like Charity, The Bridge). Deep Cuts is a bit more poppy and not nearly as refined as Silent Shout. Definitely worth buying though if you're a fan of The Knife. Do anything you can to see them live."
4,"Sounds like Tegan & Sara, but better.",The first song by far being the best. It'll make you want to play video games in the dark while gazing upon the vast starry sky. Or dance your face off.
5,plus,"this record i soo good, and the dvd? is totally awesome! i love all the videos but theres no need for this dvd if you have silent shout, just sayin"
5,colors red and blue,I discovered The Knife a few years ago and have been hooked ever since. They have great lyrics set to good music. You can't go wrong
2,Shower heads work fine but the diverter and plastic housings are junk,"I bought this as a temporary replacement shower head. The diverter is plastic and junk and cracks after varying amounts of usage. If I were you, go to a hardware store or big box store and check out the solid, metal diverters and shutoffs in the same section as the shower heads and find a half-decent shower head and put all the pieces together with teflon tape on the threads. It will cost a little more and take slightly more time but you will be much more happy in the end and will not be replacing within the year."
2,dissapointing,"When I found this book I was excited in that I remember well the incident and was keen to find out how this pilot managed to achieve his daring defection. Ploughing through the pages, and indeed that is what I was doing, I got bored very quickly as as little of the content actually stuck to the implied story. I could read about the collapse of the Soviet Union in many text and feel that the author missed the truelly remarkable episode of this event. Many of the photos contained in the book are not reflected in the story so what was the point? If you are interested in the former soviet union go for it, otherwise...."
5,Fulcrum Review,"Excellent book! Like it's predecessor ""Mig Pilot"" it details the failing of life under communism & why the the so-called ""worker's paradise"" was actually more like the ""worker's hell"" - it is also a glimpse into the workings of the Soviet military & why the West had nothing to fear from the Russians - 60 Minutes did an interview with Alexander Zuyev back in 1992 - it is worth watching! Sadly,he died in 2001 in a light plane crash in Washington state"
4,Excellent Read for Cold War Enthusiast.,Book is extremely well written. It provides an excellent insight into the Soviet airpower structure at the height of the Cold War. Highly recommended by this retired USAF pilot.
5,Recommended for audiences from young adults through adults,"Sentence building, modifiers, and common grammar are usually covered in grammar school and long forgotten in adulthood, so it's refreshing to find a fun review by grammarian Dr. Laurie Rozakis who links sexual innuendoes with basic grammar for maximum effect. Modern examples and fun social and historical references add spice to the topic, with plenty of examples and exercises throughout encouraging all ages to identify and repair common grammatical errors. A lively, whimsical yet solid references, highly recommended for audiences from young adults through adults."
2,Patently Banal,"Skip it and read Lynne Truss. Eats, Shoots & Leaves is a vastly superior book. The tired jokes and predictable humor from ""Comma Sutra"" grates from the very first few pages. Did YOU know ghoti could be used to spell ""fish""? Yes. We did. Not too much of substance here, just language tricks and some simplified history."
1,Full of errors,"By page 10, I had found 4 pretty significant errors that are generally agreed upon by most grammar resources. I teach editing, grammar, and style. I'm always on the lookout for hip, interesting, critical, and accurate grammar books for college students, for editors in various settings, in a variety of formats. I thought this would be one. I can only share it with students as an bad example. It almost appears to be addressed, by the way, to writers for whom English is not a first language ... but not really. Don't bother with this--there's not enough useful material to be worth sifting through the bad."
1,Interchangeable like cereal,"Goodness, what a bunch of strung-together fantasy clichés. It's adequate if you've never read a fantasy novel before, but if you have, it's as much dead wood as any. A completely interchangeable piece of fantasy trash, the author trying to cover up her lack of flair or originality by a ""message"" - which has been done before, repeatedly, and by better writers."
3,young indy,"This was a good video, and I've waited seven years for the series to be released. I was disappointed to find out that Old Indy is not even featured. Perhaps the worst thing they done was to put two episodes together with new footage. This didn't even look right because all of the actors are noticeably older, and Sean Patrick Flanery's hair is obviously longer in the back. They should have thought about these things beforehand, and perhaps filmed them this way in the first place, not try and finish them now as Star Wars Special Edition so tragically looked."
3,Three and a half stars (couldn't figure out how to do 1/2*)!,"The first half is cute and very fun to watch (with a feeling very similar to that of one of the other films by this director: The Rocketeer). I enjoyed the young comedic romance and Hardy Boys/Nancy Drewish mystery. The second half is good, but stretches credibility a tad having Young Indy getting involved with Pancho Villa. There is a good confrontation with an old foe and old score. Staggering production values for a small screen effort (rivals much of the big screen)."
5,Good movie!,"This film is exciting! Indy and his girlfriend, Nancy Stratenmeyer whose father wrote the Nancy Drew mysteries, solve a mystery in the first half involving a traitorous employee and theft of important submarine plans. Lucasfilm hints that Nancy's father based the fictional Nancy Drew on his daughter. I also liked that Indy helps Mr. Stratenmeyer with his stories. The Pancho Villa part is thrilling and fast-paced, Indy's impulsiveness and gallantry getting him more than he bargains for. Eventually, he catches up with his old enemy Demetrius (from ""My First Adventure,"" not currently available on video) and retrieves the fabled Jackal headpiece, originally stolen from the tomb of an Ancient Egyptian architect. All in all, this is a great film of excitement and intrigue, worthy of the name Indiana Jones."
3,rare games but bad also,"these game are used to be the best but now they stink. compared to value of these game get them because they are rare, not much of these game can be found on public markets so it worth it for few bucks."
3,Bad,These games are just bad. These games are boring. And stupid games they are. Well I like Road Rash and Need For Speed 2 is ok but the rest are just bad.The rest are just boring. The rest just s**k.
5,A must read for anyone interested in MRP,"Everybody interested in MRP has seen Orlicky's book as a reference work. This book compliles it's work plus all the developments of this technique since its issue in the fifties. The beauty of this work is that it gathers all the pitfalls, successes and fails encountered by the ""MRP crusades"". It also contends about the realationship between MRP and JIT and it's possible combination."
2,Not an angel... but WITH angels.,"I haven't bought this book and I am not going to. I am glad it can be a comfort to many. But, having just experienced a MC this week, I am looking for something to help my young son understand, but I don't want to lie to him. The idea that people become angels when they die is not correct doctrine. I believe my child is in heaven with the angels, but people do not become angels. I am not being heartless. There is nothing wrong with not being an angel. After all, Jesus came to die for our souls, not for the angels. I just wish that so much of what is provided to comfort grieving parents didn't suggest something that isn't true."
3,"Sweet book, but I can't ignore the theological misnomer","I would love to love this book. The concern voiced by another reviewer is actually one of the reasons I liked it...it ends open-ended, it admits that it isn't just all okay in the morning. This is a good thing. There is hope implied in some of it, but it gives the child permission to not smile at the end. This is healthy.But while I am grateful to my pastor for passing it along to me after I miscarried twins, I have not, nor will I, read it to my children. People who die do not become angels. I know that's not a popular thing to bring up...and I truly do not wish to offend a grieving parent...but the idea of passed loved ones getting wings and a halo is popular myth, not based in Scripture. :( I do not want to add theological confusion to my children's grief."
2,Disappointed with the ending,"I did not read the reviews before purchasing this book because I loved the title. I do think this is a nice, simple story to read to my almost 2 year old. However, I wanted to write a review because I was very disappointed with the ending. For a 2 year old, I was hoping the book could explain the situation and leave her feeling comforted in some way (she was very excited for baby brother and now he is not coming). Yes, I agree that it is good to teach her that it is okay to be sad about the situation and yes, I agree that having the baby would be better than having an angel. But at her age, I just wanted a book to help explain to her why everyone was sad and her routine has been thrown off and then leave her comforted in some way. I felt this ending may not leave her comforted. I actually placed paper over the words on the last two pages and created my own ending that I saw was more fitting to my daughter and our situation."
1,Terrible!,This book was not the least uplifting to any person or any child...I was very disappointed in this book. It's depressing and no good for children. I am a teacher and I bought this for a student and I ended up throwing it in the garbage. This book was a useless waste of money
1,I returned this book!,"I was going to give this book to a close relative and their son when they lost their baby. But I was very disappointed in this book. I actually thought that it was horrible! I myself would not recommend it to anyone especially not someone you love and care about! However I did purchase Mommy, please don't cry... There Are No Tears In Heaven by Linda Deymaz!It was much better and I do recommend it for anyone!"
1,"We were gonna have a baby, but we had an Angel instead.","I can only say that this book was so ""COLD"" the way it was written gave NO comfort to me as a Grandma and I could not even imagine letting my other grandchildren read this. All I can say Its a comforting feeling to know you have an ""angel"" if you cant have a baby. This book makes it out to be a horrible thing. How sad. I would have NEVER purchased this book if I would have known how poorly and inconsiderate it was written."
1,Selmer Paris poor customer service and warranty,We got a bad Selmer C Star and sent it back to Selmer Paris. The mouth piece was not right and we had two different accomplished saxophone players tell us this. We sent the C* back to Selmer only for them to say that nothing was wrong with it. We paid too much for something that was defective and Selmer Paris has a bad reputation when it comes to warranty's (just Google it and see for yourself). We were loaned another C* and the difference is night and day!
1,Sent the wrong product.,"I ordered this because I wanted all the different sizes and shapes, but they just sent me a box of assorted sized strip bandaids. Rather disappointing."
5,FILTER,GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE AND HAS HELD UP AFTER THE MONTHS OF USE SO FAR. NO COMPLAINTS SO FAR
2,good thought / bad idea,well built but caused large build up due to cool down of chimney exhaust. Used for 1/2 season and threw it out. Save your money and use a small fan behind the stove.
1,Not described well,As a home brewer I was looking for a book on commercial / micro brew pub info. A seven barrel brewery is a specific engineered brew system that brews 7 barrel batches of beer at one time. I was disappointed that this book had nothing to do with describing the workings of a 7 barrel system / brewery as I was putting together a business plan to open a commercial brew pub. So it was an overpriced beginner's book for recipes and techniques to home brew. Much better books on the subject I already own.
1,Bad Quality=Bad Wheels!,"I am disappointed with this toy because I bought it and it doesn't work at all! It gets dirt in the center of the wheel, and it STOPS! I am so dissapointed with this quality!!"
3,Cannot hear the dialog,"I was most interested in seeing AND hearing the DVD about WWII, however the audio is simply non-existent in this DVD. I had my volume maxed out and still could not hear the dialog for the hissing and low quality.The video is okay, but the sound makes it not worth the money unfortunately."
1,Disappointed,"The DVD sleeve is very nice, so I had hopes that the visual qualtiy of the two DVD's would be very good, which is not the case. The poor quality is no doubt the result of these being produced directly from the free, dark and fuzzy reference room VHS or 1"" tape copies at the National Archives. These low visual quality shelf copies are intended for content review and the idea then, is to have masters made from their film intermediates that would be ordered and processed by a NA approved lab. This does not appear to be the case.When DVD's such as these are made from the 35mm film intermediates, the result is a crisp, sharp, gorgeous black and white result. If I could return these DVD's I would do so. After watching a few minutes of the DVD's I set them aside, and will give them to someone else."
1,Nothing Restricted about these videoes,"B&W short films with added in commentary and gun fire effects. Nothing to write home about, the box indicates ""secrets"" revealed. What secrets is the question! Nothing new presented on these DVDs if you are just a bit knowledgeable about WWII. The B&W quality is acceptable on most, but on some a bit dark. Save your money and skip this video, it is not worth it!"
4,Restricted Films of WW2,"I have bought several fils taken during the World War 2, taken during that period in Germany. Unless YOU buy something like this, don't know how YOU could ever see it. Worth viewing."
2,WWii Restricted .Disappointment,Disappointed in quality of film. Much to dark to see clearly. Background should have been lightened to make clearer.To much jumping around to different areas. Thought editing could have been much better in keeping inspecific areas.
2,What's the point?,"These two products have no place being together.The grateful dead album is great - for what it is....their first album, before they even defined themselves. To put this with the midnights album is sinful. Where the beat meets the street just plain sucks!"
4,good tea,"Strong peppermint tea. I enjoy it when I am getting a migraine. Still not sure if it wards it off, but supposedly will help. Is refreshing, and smells really good."
1,Its Terrible,"This game not manages to pull off being not fun, its also super buggy as well. I have a hard time imagining anyone being able to successfully patch this piece of garbage, and even if they could they shouldn't because its just not a good game.Poor gameplay, terrible puzzles, godawful dialogue and story, all conspire to make this one of the top games on my Avoid At All Costs list.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
3,Don't Miss This Review About Scarecrows!,"The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight by R.L. StineJodie can already imagine the stories her grandpa will be telling around the fireplace at night. She can also taste her grandma's chocolate chip pancakes. Guess again! When Jodie and her brother Mark get there, they realize that their grandparents are out-of-shape. Then one night, Jodie sees the twelve new scarecrows trying to get off their stakes! Will people believe her? If you're hoping to be a farmer, read this book.This book was okay. I chose this book because it looked the really scary. I also picked this book because I like the Goosebumps series.I think R.L. Stine tried to show how people can cooperate. Or, he wanted to show us how much responsibility you need on a farm."
5,Favorite,"I absolutely loved this book when i was a kid. It was my favorite Goosebumps book, and i read a lot of them!! Now my nephew is getting into reading them and i just ordered this for his birthday. I can't wait for him to read it and see what his thoughts are on it!!"
3,Dame that waas fake,I think this book was kind of boring.Because everybody knows a scarecrow can not become alive.That is it.
5,Willy: A wimp of a chimp becomes a CHAMP!,"Willy the Wimp is a hilarious yet touching story that will satisfy readers of all ages. At the heart of the story is the adorable Willy, a young chimp with a self-esteem problem. He decides to answer a ""muscleman"" ad in order to change his body, and in the process discovers his own inner strength. The book's illustrations are really fantastic (imagine bodybuilding gorillas). They support the text, complimenting the language and style of the story (as well as providing many laughs). This makes Willy the Wimp a perfect choice for young beginning readers as well as developing readers...and for the bedtime storyteller! A fabulous picture book that will be read again and again. You'll love it!"
1,"Cheap tool, cheap performance","As some others have mentioned, I havent found that the tips just fall off when the tool is turned over, however...When using the tool to engage a clip, if too much pressure is applied to push the clip on the tool tip does lever away from the pressure due to a large amount of slop in the way the tip is clipped to the tool.Also, when stretching a clip prior to placing it on the part, if you stretch it too far the tip will slip sideways and can bend the clip.The problem in both situations is that there is just too much slop between the toolheads and handle.I also don't like the lack of a storage box for the tips, I hate having parts for tools strewn all over my toolbox.Because often this leads to one of the parts getting lost. A tool with multiple parts should come with a storage boxfor all the parts so they can live together.This is a cheap tool and its performance is sub par. I regret buying it."
1,Terrible tool--stay clear!,"Snap ring pliers with interchangeable tips have been around for a long time, so this versatile set (four tips in total: straight and bent tips in large and small diameters, that can be placed in position for either internal or external snap rings) looked very attractive. This tool was a complete disappointment, however. When installed, the tips wobble, then fall off when sideways pressure is applied. There is a removable pivot with a cross-bar that is supposed to lock the tips into place when using the external position. Instead when you put the tips on, ""lock"" them into position and turn the tool over, everything (tips and lock) falls off the pliers. I did a double take! As you know if you've used snap rings, you must often work in a difficult orientation and apply some downward pressure to keep the tips engaged in the small holes in the ring. A rigid tool that you can trust is absolutely necessary. This tool is unusable and should not be on the market. For shame, Irwin!"
2,A Pig in a Poke?,I bought this thing without checking the pin specifications thinking that it came with standard sizes; no one to blame but myself. Buyer beware; this might not fit your snap rings.Pros:1. Easily intercgangible heads for internal/external snap rings.2. Inexpensive with adaquate quality and suitable utility for occasional use.Cons:1. No tip size specifications at amazon.com.2. No information at Irwin WEB site.3. Only one 180 deg tip size works with standard 1/4 amd 3/8 inch snap rings. This severely limits the usefulness of this tool. I can just see myself with a jeweler's file reducing the size of the others...4. You can injure your fingers opening the package.5. Needs a storage case (Michigan Industrial Tools has similar pliers with a case).Sugestions:1. You can use the inner molded plastic packaging for storage.2. Irwin needs to provide a variety of heads with tip size specifications.
2,Light duty only,I purchased this tool to take a snap ring out of my Oster 76 hair clipper.The good:Interchangeable tipsThe Bad:Tip size was too small for the ring I was trying to remove. The tips of the took kept coming out of the holes on the ring when I was applying pressure.(1-1/2 inch ring with holes that a round toothpick would fit into)This product might work for other smap rings (very light duty with smaller holes maybe)My final thoughts: This item should be able to remove a 1-1/2 snap ring and it didn't. Pass on getting this item unless you are only planning on light duty. I ended up purchasong the Channellock 927 8-Inch Retaining Ring Plier and it worked flawlessly on the first try.
2,unstable without modification,"The positive feature of this item is that you can easily convert the pliers to one of four different heads. This also appears to be the major negative of this product. The center shaft that holds the interchangeable heads onto the grip does not stay in. It is meant to be kept in place by a sliding bar built into the shaft that is kept in place by the tension of a spring. In my opinion the shaft pin is longer than it needs to be and adequate tension is not maintained on the slide to keep the pin from falling out. It is also possible for the two pins from the grip that apply the power to the points to slip out, again because the center pin is too long. I replaced the center pin with a nut and bolt that fit and these now work really well for me. I don't hate these conidering the price I paid, but they could easily be top-rate if the pin was different."
4,Not bad,"They work for what I need them for, an average tool for the typical snap rings I encounter on projects. Now, for oddballs, I have specialty tools, but these are great for the daily jobs that I need a snap ring pliar for, and to have four internal and four internal for $12.00, who can bi*** about it? Now I do agree that the lack of a storage box is dumb, but rather than cry like a hurt princess, I used the plastic tray they came in as a template, and made a box from a 6x9"" piece of 4/4 scrap, 2 scraps of 3/8"" plywood, 2 mini hinges and a hasp, all from Michael's craft store, using my Dremel router. Boo Hoo! an extra project to make a box to fit my storage needs"
4,Nice!,"A quality tool - not sure what the other reviews are complaining about? Central holding-pin on my tool works great, versatile, easy to change heads..etc. This is a quality tool, something I should have bought years ago before I struggled with numerous other snap-rings. Worked great on my Rock Shox Reba rebuild."
4,Another Gem,"Once again Ms. Kagan has written a novel of depth and emotion. I'm amazed at her ability to create characters that I feel so emotionally connected to -- this is not something that I find with many writers. Ms. Kagan has a particular gift for including more than one main heroine in her novels and describing their point of view, quite often in opposition to each other, in a manner that makes them seem real. The suffering of the two heroines as they await news about their beloved is almost palpable.It's refreshing to read a book that's not about two sisters bonding, or a courtroom drama, as so many are these days, but rather about realistic emotions and not so happy situations.I have read all Ms. Kagan's books and I'll eagerly await the next."
4,Great book,"All in all I really enjoyed reading this. It was a little slow at times, but easy to get in to and picture what was happening."
5,A Terrific Read!,"This book is terrific! If you're looking for a book that will force you to sit back and think about everyday life, this is it. This honest story of a man's brave journey down a river of pain, adventure, joy, and growth will inspire your soul and lift your spirits. Eddy's telling of his journey will touch you, guaranteed."
4,High Flying Fun,"Overall a good release by the Toasters, Dub 56 features a lot of the great charts you'll hear when they play live. In that vein, this CD features a number of live tracks at the end of the disc, including such faves as ""Mona"" and ""Weekend in L.A."" This disc features a good mix of lead vocals between Coolie Ranx and Bucket Hingley, so fans of either one should be pleased. An especially nice touch is the slick rendition of ""A Night in Tunisia,"" originally written by Dizzy Gillespie, a chart that on this album receives the smooth treatment of the Toasters' horn section. I recommend this album."
3,Not too bad,"This cd is allright. I like the end where they put up part of their live performance in LA. To me, that part of this album stands out the most."
5,A Prize gift for Idaho Expatriates,"This volume was on the bookshelf of a friend's home when we visited Boise Thanksgiving ' 99. I grew up in Lewiston and had Idaho History as part of the basic Elementary School curriculum. I therefore fancied there would not be many surprises between the covers of Mr. Conley's treatise. I can honestly say it caused me regret to reshelve the book unfinished when our visit to Boise was over. Besides the text, the vintage photos carry the reader back in time. I have no hesitation in endorsing this as the best Idaho History book I've ever read. As soon as we returned to Bozeman, I ordered a copy to present my buddy Steve Etheridge who is a professional Storyteller in Indiana, not just for the great details of history, but because he once lived in Idaho and has a deep reverence for the land and its spirit. I am sure this would be a highly prized gift for any friends or family who are Idaho Expatriates."
3,Good History - Bad Tour Guide,"We're planning our first trip to Idaho and were looking for the basic ""have to have it with us"" tour guide to help plan the trip and guide us through it. This book isn't it.It appears to be a great book of local history and would be fine for backup information about the state but it is not good for planning a trip.The only way to find items of interest is to read the whole book, set up your own itinerary, and basicaly write your own guide book from the information found here.Fodors and Frommer have nothing to fear."
5,GREAT Christmas Music,If you have been to Germany during Christmas you would enjoy listening to this CD. It's like going back in time and getting that warming effect of that special time of year.
3,A different sort of bedtime story!,"A delightful version of the Aboriginal Dreamtime story from Australia. Bright, amusing illustrations that will interest you as well as your child. Tiddalik is a giant frog who wakes up one day with a giant thirst. So he drinks all the water in the world! All the other indigenous and exotic animals get together to think of a way to get Tiddalik to open his mouth and let out some of the water. They try jokes, silly faces, pranks, etc., but nothing works until the platypus hears all the noise and comes out to tell everyone to shut up. Tiddalik has never seen such a funny-looking creature, and he bursts out laughing and doesn't stop until all the water has come out. It's fun to see all the interesting and strange creatures from Australia in the colorful illustrations and should help develop your child's interest in unusual animals. Whether you've been to Australia or not, this is a great story for the youngster in your life!"
4,Dream a Lil Dream,"If you want to know what your dreams mean, this is the book to get. It gives you explainations of each symbol that is in your dream from A - Z. Dreams are hard to remember when you wake up...writing them down will be helpful in interpreting the meaning of your dreams. You will be surprised how well the symbols relate to your life at that moment."
5,GREAT FOR EVERYONE SIMPLE TO FOLLOW,"I LOVE THIS BOOK! THIS BOOK HAS PRATICALLY EVERYTHING YOU COULD EVER DREAM OF, I CANT PUT IT DOWN, EXCEPT TO WRITE THIS REVIEW LOL, ITS A VERY SIMPLE BOOK TO UNDERSTAND AND GIVES YOU MULTIPLE MEANINGS ON ONE SYMBOL. IF YOU EVER WONDERED WHAT YOUR DREAMS MEAN THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU, LATELY, IVE BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN DREAMS, AND THIS BOOK IS GREAT FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND THEM. I REALLY RECOMMENED THIS BOOK TO ANYONE."
3,Changes for Religious after Vatican II,"A dozen creative writers have given their ""views"" of the changing lives of todays religious communities. Many of the authors give their ""deep scholarly"" experiences to explain past and present life in a religious community. The changes offered after Vatican II have opened many doors, many of which the hierachy of the church wish they could close. The nun of yesterday can no longer be found....she has changed direction and attitude but is always striving to find God. Many of the essayists have suggested that the challenges of the religious of today will bring about a hopeful renewal for tomorrow."
3,Size Does Not Matter...,"Passable average chick lit. Very in your face type of narration where you know each character's flaws and strengths with each page. No holding of vital information that can tease you to turn the pages at a faster rate to uncover the facts.Not so perfect Emma has only 32AA breasts which crops up in her thoughts thru out her life but this is compensated by a very warm bond of friendship she has with her loyal girlfriends and gay friends.She laments her bad luck in finding true love. And when she does find true love, she does not seem to be able to come to grips with it neither does the man who desires her."
2,These cups runneth over with cliches and lame humor,"I bought this book based on the Amazon reviews, and sorry ladies, but I disagree. This book is terrible - Bridget Jones without the wit, just lots of tiresome, near-hysterical whining and enthusing, along with the usual misadventures of our hapless single-girl heroine. I like the expression, ""Small breasted women have big hearts,"" but unfortunately, this forgettable character has no depth and no originality.The hot pink cover should've tipped me off."
5,Chick Lit at its best!!!!,"The market's become so saturated with chick lit books, and I've been somewhat disenchanted with the genre as of late. Then along comes this truly delightful example of chick lit from Michelle Cunnah which has made me want to wear my Manolos and sip Cosmos once again.Adorable, funny, endearing, 32AA is an impressive debut. I couldn't put it down. Michelle has a great way with words and her main character is absolutely charming. If you're sick of boring books about superficial characters with no soul and want a funny, cute story with a heroine you can relate to and fall in love with, pick up this book. You won't regret it."
5,Simply Brilliant!,"I'll keep it simple... This is must read book!It will keep you turning the pages into the wee hours of the morning. I myself was unable to put it down. LOLThe story lines are extremely well developed and enthralling.The reader, especially if you are from the Metro area, will be able to identify with these characters.I can not say enough about this piece of work... But don't take my word for it.. get a copy and see for yourself, You will not be disappointed.This is a great sticking stuffer for anyone whose love chic lit!!"
4,COMPATIBLE INK CARTRIDGES,"These work well. I like the compatible cartridges because they are cheaper. I don't print pictures with any brand of compatible ink cartridge because they don't work well, the colors are off. I do like them for everything else because of the price difference."
1,get what you pay for,"I was happy at first, especially to pay only half price. Upon initial installation, all the colors seemed to work fine. Then when they started getting about half way through, they started either just not showing up, or printing weird color results. This is very frustrating when trying to print professional looking documents/business cards! I will stick with the tried-and-true name brand inks from now on."
2,Happy... at first...,"I was happy at first that these cartridges worked, but then they just stopped working. I guess you get what you pay for. They were great about sending me the correct ink cartridge after the wrong one was sent to my house. So, their customer service seems really good, but their product isn't that great."
1,Not compatible!!,"After installing the ink and printing a test page I called support because the printer did not recognize the new ink. Support emailed instructions to me for unplugging the printer and trying to install again. It didn't work so I called them back, I received additional instructions which allowed me to print but the colors were not exact. I would not recommend this product."
3,Ink run out fast,"It work, but don't expect to print high quality picture. It does not last as long as the Epson Brand."
2,clear to see they're not original Epson,colors just a bit off EOM inks. And they kinda smell funny for a while.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I purchased the ink for everyday printing projects, not photo's, but one of the cartidges were defective and would not print. Had to go the the store and buy what I needed which cost as much for one as I paid for all six. But you get what you pay for and I needed the color to make the rest of them work, it won't print if one is reading empty. So it does fine just to print everyday items, but you may get one thats defective (that's why the 2 stars) but for the price buy two sets and you may get all the colors working."
4,Work Just Fine,"I can't stand the idea of paying a ton just for ink cartridges that have a brand name on them, so I've gone with these the past couple times I needed new ink. These seem to work great in my Epson R200. They fit in just like the other cartridges, and seem to last me about a year or so. I don't do a lot of printing, just confirmations and concert tickets and stuff, maybe an occasional photo or two. But I've been totally happy with these cartridges. I just always do the printer head cleaning and alignment after installing them. Give them a try, you'll be happy you went with them and saved a bunch of money."
2,Good Value if you can get them to send the right item,"When I first saw this item on an Amazon search, I felt like wow what a score. I don't print any photo's so I only need the ink to print documents and don't see the necessity to spend double the amount on Epson genuine inks. The problem occurred upon receipt of the order which was shipped in a timely manner. I received 6 cartridges but two were yellow and no primary magenta was included, the seller was totally unresponsive and never answered any of my emails. Additionally, the cartridges were not immediately recognized by the printer and somehow caused the existing cartridges to register as empty when they had ink left in them. Finally the cartridges are very messy and caused my fingers to be stained for about a week (couldn't get the ink off my fingers no matter how much I scrubbed) So, in conclusion you get what you pay for, friends."
2,I love McGriff but...,"If you like Jimmy McGriff, you will not like this CD! This item it's just for Hammond organ fans. The sound is great, but the players looks tired here! Jimmy sounds very old and his right hand is so slow and imprecise... anyway, maybe someone will like it if he's not a Jimmy McGriff fan... :-)"
5,Love this one,Memories come flooding back of the Isle de la Cite and the bateaux-mouches going by on the Seine and way too many bottles of Bordeaux and too little food to ward off the hang-over.
2,i dont like it.,"i dont like it.I wish there would have been samples to listen to, before bying it ,next time i will make sure Ilisten before buying."
1,cafe de paris,- When I heard it through the PC headphones it sounded lovely but on my Bang and Olufson player it sounded terrible - I will never play it again and it has certainly put me off buying anymore.
3,A matter of taste!,"I love french music, but for me this CD just didn't do it. Music is like wine, beer, etc., very personal. I'm sure there are others that will be crazy about this CD, but it is not exciting me."
5,great book for independent study!,"I bought this book because I had just finished an undergrad degree in Chinese, but there were still many ""real-life"" situational conversations which I couldn't think through. Although already a bit outdated in some terminology (i.e. giving vocab for 'walkman' or 'typewriter' - though published in 2004, i think), this is the best book i found that gave authentic expressions and vocabulary. Every character is also given in pinyin (I hate it when I have to look up characters in other books!), and many expressions also show a character-by-character definition (explaining that ''' - ""to stand sbdy up"" literally means to ""release pidgeon""). Chapters are divided up thematically. I wish I had bought this book years ago; it's served as an excellent review for me, and it's very easy for me to read through. Don't hesitate - just buy!"
4,Clear and Concise,"Hey ""Do it Your selfer's"" I know that's not a word. This book has simple yet very clear drawings and great exlinations and they tell you what not to do also. I would definitely recommend this book for beginners who are not afraid to try it them selves."
1,The North West Miramichi,Has been reprinted by Doreen's Son...upon request ...for further information contact Joan at jemfhs@nbnet.nb.ca
5,Teaching Humor,"Loretta is a must have for those who want to share with groups who suffer from stress and burnout. Also, good at home if you are suffering the same. Some find her to be less than funny, but most people laugh and understand the message. It's a wonderful teaching tool and Loretta is a break from the traditional teaching style."
3,"Some good songs, a lot of bad songs","This CD had a ton of horrible songs starting from song number one to song number 11 with only one good song in between those. The good songs in this CD from my point of view are: Heaven, Take Me Away, The Theme, Something, Reason, and especially Come Into My Dream. I advise you to buy this CD, but watch out for some bad songs."
5,Guitjazzathon,"I can sum up my opinion of Scott Whitney's Guitjazzathon in a single word...Superb! Since I am neither a professional musician or a professional critic, I won't try and bore you with a lot of big words. Do you like good music, that's easy to listen to, with a mellow beat and a little spice mixed in? Then this is for you. Great job Scott. Your two Christmacoustic CDs were awesome too! When is your next CD coming out? Soon I hope!"
4,The GL Diet For Dummies,"I like the book overall...but, its written by someone in England,and there are many food items that we don't HAVE here in the USAso...its not really perfect...but it DOES give you a lot of goodsound info on the GI plan...and as the title states..for DUMMIES,it IS easy to understand."
1,Plasticky Stick,I have used many racquest and by far this is a let down. Too plasticky and lacking in good control. May plan to give it away.
1,Mirror in America,This is a must read book. Dr. Franklyn is the best writer ever.He deserves the respect of the entire world.
4,Positive,"This book was inspiratinal to me. I am very grateful I was allowed to stumble accross it. It helped me to gain a higher degree of respect for Dr Franklin considering what he has done and when he accomplished those achievements(along with maintaining his family). This book also gave me a greater appreciation of the opportunities that are now open to African-Americans as a people. I had originally checked this book out at the library and in the course of reading it decided that I should own a copy.The very intellectual Dr. Franklin has written this book in a way that seems to convey his personality. I felt like I got to know him, the man, every so slightly in a personally way. I wish I had read this earlier in my life."
3,A good read on the African American struggle,"This is a very good read if you are interested in racism and related struggles and accomplishments. Additionally, it provides a wonderful story of one man's life and his journey through white and black America."
5,Great Read!,"I really enjoyed the written format and getting to know this man, his family history as well the impact of Black History over all. I've met him and to see this man at 90+ is amazing. A worthy book to include in your personal library."
3,Surprisingly good.,"The Damned have recorded some of the greatest studio albums ever but I have never heard a satisfying live album before this. This is not the classic line up-it's from their brief but fruitful mid 90s ""reunion"" period-but the sound quallity is top notch and the then new material is well preformed. (The songs were not yet recorded-it was new for the audience.)"
4,Easy way to transfer large files between computers,Very neat device! Works well with Win95/98/Me.You may have a slight installation problem with WinNT and Win2000 but fear not latest drivers are available on the manufactures website. Excellent for large data transfers between computers. CDR's and RW's are neat for music and data backup but Zip drives go a long way when transferring files.
3,"Not the most elegant solution, but it does the job","I've never found Zip drives to be very speedy, despite the name, but this particular drive is quite slow and quite loud.However, in its defense, it is extremely reliable even though I've dropped it and knocked it over several times. It doesn't take up much space on my desk. It is so lightweight and flat that I can throw it in the pocket of my laptop case and take it anywhere.The Zip disk has been a good solution for me in terms of sharing files between my desktop and laptop, and this drive is an adequate, reliable, affordable way to do that."
3,Zip 100MB Drive,"good for home, but requires an electrical supply, so it's not very good for notebook computers and the mobile user."
1,Returned,Very disappointed the Zip drive did not work. Very difficult to communicate with vendor.. Do not recommend very dissatisfied and disappointed
1,Unserviceable,"The product was unserviceable. The first time I inserted a card, it would not do anything. When I tried to eject it, it got locked inside and would not release it. I had to tear it apart to release the card. I would not buy from these people again."
4,A blast from the past,"After trying several times previously to purchase this CD, only to find it sold out, I am glad I finally have it. I remember this well from the 70s (as a vinyl LP), before we used the term ""fusion"" very extensively to describe music that is a mixture of rock and jazz.This CD is a good blend of musical forms--primarily rock and jazz, good vocals, with a little R&B; thrown in, and then stirred. Enjoy."
4,funky all the time,Brian Auger let himself in this one to take his funk etitude to the top. he bland it with some latin rock and bluse influenses and the result is somthing thet you will listen to over and over agein. buy it now.
4,A band definitely worth discovering,"""On My Home"" kicks this one off with the balance raw force and lyrical sophistication that you learn to expect from Joe Hurley and Rogue's March. Each song carries with it an intriguing story, whether from a personal standpoint or just a general observation on the world at large, each one sitting in a musical setting that well serves the lyrics and the growling poetry of the singer. The forays into a more country sound on songs like the cover of ""Detour"" are occasionally jarring, but the eventually win over the listener with their authentic feel. While I didn't find this as stunning as their first CD, it definitely is a keeper."
5,Rock me,"I have 2 favorite songs on this album! I've enjoyed watching Susan sing on YouTube, and I'd love to see her live."
2,"Good vocals, lame guitar work","Tedeschi's voice has matured and become more expressive over the years, but she should either finally, belatedly, get some lead chops together or abandon her ego and hire on a player that matches the obviously prodigious abilities of the band backing her up."
4,Outstanding music marred by weak mixing,"I've been a Susan Tedeschi fan for a while, and I was so excited to get this album for Christmas -- and overall, it's great music. Tedeschi is an outstanding blues/rock musician, and she's in great form with this recording from Austin City Limits.I was really surprised, though, when I popped it in and heard nothing but Tedeschi's singing and the organ/synth. Yeah, the drums are present. During solos, you can sort of hear Tedeschi's excellent guitar. But the predominant instrument in the mix is that ever-present synth, and that is just not the right mix for her music.Tedeschi is so good that this album is still excellent -- but more for the hard-core fans who can appreciate the alternate sound. The recording/mixing wasn't up to par, so if you've never heard Tedeschi before, go with one of her studio albums."
3,a poor interpretation,"This project is a modern interpretation of what is known as very famous Georgian folk music, which by itself is an excellent idea, but its quality is somewhat dissapointing to me. It is much better to enjoy the original versions of these folk rithms, which quite sadly you may not be able to find online yet. However, speaking of the project, after a little bit of tuning, balancing and enriching this may become a remarkable one. Let's wait till it matures."
1,total garbage!,this is awful this is not music just noisemusic was good from 1960-1989 after that music stunk totallyabsolute garbage mindless garbageno imagination whatsoever
3,Pleasant surprise,"Having heard ""Who Do You Love Now?"" and ""Put the Needle on It,"" I decided to invest in Kylie's little sister on this album and was pleasantly surprised that the rest wasn't all filler as I feared. ""I Begin to Wonder"" is a class club-thumper that tops anything on the album, and ""Creep,"" ""Hey (So What),"" ""Mighty Fine"" and ""Vibe On"" are nice in their own right.The album isn't void of filler, as Dannii sounds like she is trying to salvage the filler of ""For the Record"" by sounding like a spazz. ""It Won't Work Out"" is a cheesy ballad that should not have been included at all.Overall, the album is a nice, fun listen. If you aren't crazy about the singles though, I wouldn't advise buying it, as they are the best the album has to offer."
4,DANNII the new DIVA!!,"I CANT BELIEVE ITS BEEN 5 (LONG) YEARS SINCE A NEW DANNII RECORDING BUT LET ME TELL YOU, THIS WAS WORTH THE WAIT!!THIS ALBUN GOES WAY OVER MY EXPECTATIONS FOR DANNII. ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT.THOUGH OLDER SISTER KYLIES'""FEVER"" WAS A GOOD DANCE CD,I WAS EXPECTING ONLY MADONNA'S NEW DISC ""AMERICAN LIFE"" TO TOP DANNIIS' ""NEON NIGHTS"",BOY WAS I WRONG! ""AMERICAN LIFE"" STINKS,SO MOVE OVER GIRLS,DANNII IS BACK! THE PRODUCTION IS AMAZING.""PUT THE NEEDLE ON IT"" ""PUSH"" ""ON THE LOOP"" AND HER RECENT (SHOULDVE HIT U.K.#1)IBEGIN TO WONDER"" ARE THE STAND OUTS.NEVER A DULL MOMENT HERE FOLKS. I RECOMMEND THIS DISC FOR PARTIES,HANGOVERS,HOUSECLEANING,NIGHTCLUBBING,OR WHATEVER! THIS IS DANNII'S BEST WORK TO DATE. NOW IF ONLY THE U.S.A. WOULD JUST CATCH ONTO THIS GEM!!OF A SINGER/ENTERTAINER!! KUDOS DANNII"
4,Alot of fun,Dannii (as well as Kylie) have truly been underappreciated in the states. This is one of the best albums of the past year. It is filled with music that is just good fun sing and dance along music.I look forward to her next release.
4,WILL THIS EVER GET PROMOTED IN THE USA funky dance!,"I'm a big fan of this music!, Dannii's voice kind of resemblence her sister tone, but they are way different, Kylie's music is sophisticaded dance, Dannii's is more funky, well after all, they both sound amazing!, this album wow!, full of hits!, the first single for the US is ""I Began To Wonder"" wich has one of the best beginning for a song, it just graves you, great dance, the other tracks worth listening are ""Put Needle On It"" my personal favorite, ""I Don't Wanna Loose This Feeling"" great danceable joint, the other tracks are well crafted but of course this cd does not escape from filler cuts, but they are minor mistakes.....great cd, funky dance!"
4,good fun comes stateside,"A even sexier, slightly edgier alternative to KM with this release...very fun listen overall, and ""Who do you love"" just soars. My copy has some videos which are an added treat."
3,Neon fizzles,"This must be a rather anticipated album of 2003, but somehow it has not lived up to the hype for me. While the first three singles were, no doubt, funky club hits, the rest of the album worked pretty much on a formula of retro dance.The album plays rather well from Tracks 1-6 and thereafter, nothing much sounds very different to distinguish one song from another. Several tracks like Mystify were so retro you might have mistaken it as a page out of 80's Stock-Aitken-Waterman pop.Despite this, the album does come across as being well-produced and polished though Dannii Minogue may consider stronger songs on the next album to capitalise on the talents of the producers. For now, Dannii might have proven herself a little more than before. All in all, this is good listenable pop without too much of a surprise."
4,australian pop-the new pop,A great pop album. Undeniable hooks and melodies. Like Kylies song i cant get the songs out of my head. I Begin To Wonder is defintley the best song on the album. Shes leading a new wave of australian pop music with sister kylie and fellow Australian Holly Valance. A must buy for pop lovers.
3,Good Album,"It's a good album. NOT as good as Kylie's FEVER. I love ""I Begin To Wonder""... great song; ""Creep"", ""Vibe On"", and especially ""Don't Wanna Lose This Feeling"". The rest of the album just one step above filler material. If you're reading these reviews and are expecting a work as good as Fever, you will be disapointed, if you want a pretty good dance album till the new Kylie comes out at the end of the year... enjoy!"
5,"Yet Another Ex Soapie Star Turned ""Wannabee Singer""!!!","For some reason it seems like every ex star of a daytime soap opera has decided that she wants to be a singer. Then no doubt she will start designing lingerie. I don't see the owner of Victoria's Secret releasing a pop techno single and neither should she. This album contains the usual forgettable dance music and Danni sings ""And I begin to wonder?"" I have began to wonder just how come she looks so different in photos taken over the years? If anybody can elighten me on this matter please Email me."
2,Ummmm....Kyle she ain't.,"I had such high hopes for this CD. The song that came out earlier this year on Ultra Dance 3 (Riva and Dannii--Who Do You Love Now?) was sooo good....I was so sure that if Dannii released a full-length album, it would be just as good as that one song. I was definitely wrong!! Besides the aforementioned song, the only other really good cut on here is ""I Begin To Wonder""....and that even takes a while to grow on you. I really wish I had kept my $15. If you want a really good dance music album...try the remix album from the classical music group BOND. I am listening to it now...and it's already so much better than Dannii Minogue. A piece of advice to you, Dannii: Leave this game to your sister...and do modelling or something....."
5,Neon Nights - MY SUNSHINE,"I fell in love with the domestic version of this cd and then I found the import which has 2 remixes and the 3 videos! I totally love the remixes but they are not the extended versions but the videos are great, and the cd is awesome. It kicks ass and I think it is the best buy of the import section!"
5,Truly amazing,"This album is a must have. If you have to choose Kylie or Dannii, definately Dannii on this one. Not to sell Kylie short, but I was amazed in the lyrics to the astonishing production. There is a little something for everyone. Great dance album with a lot of funky riffs over ubeat, smooth lyrics. From track one to the end its hard to pick a favorite. If you need something to jump start your morning on your commute to work or just to cheer up, this album will put you in a good mood. You could definately hurt yourself shakin' ya a** to this one. I think I actually broke a butt cheek. LOL!!! But seriously , I would pay double the retail price if I had to. This is coming from a loyal, dedicated Hip-Hop/R&B fan. Why are you still reading?!?!?!? BUY THIS ALBUM !!!!"
5,Thanks!!!!,"This has been a great journey for me. I truly enjoyed this book and hope others will too! I found this an inspiring book that appreciates a great deal that the USA has to offer; the land, the people, the parks, the places, as well as, a strong relationship between Bob and Theda. Thanks for sharing your adventures with us!!!"
4,Great resource!,"This book was filled with excellent spelling exercises. I would have copies of some pages for ""extra credit"" practice. Students loved the fun exercises. Great addition for any teacher needing extra spelling practice for his/her students."
1,I'm SO disappointed!!,"Those people (like me) who buy Jesus Franco's movies don't expect high art or even much plot for that matter. However, I don't know what he was thinking about here. I love the kinkiness and nudity of most Franco movies, as well as the occasional kinky night club act scenes and music. This movie fails to capture any of that. So what does that leave? Not much and I sincerely wish that I could get my money back for this one. Thank you very much."
2,Franco still playing with cinema,"It is refreshing to find Franco still unafraid of playing with cinema. He takes the Frankenstein myth and injects his own outrageous themes into it. Moira Frankenstein is visited by her father's female creature who eliminates all sexual predators/suitors from Moira's life. That is the plot. The pace is hypnotic or should I say slow? If you have never seen a Franco film before, this not the place to start. He is preaching to the converted with this work. A good place to start your descent into Franco madness would be at the beginning with ""The Awful Dr. Orlof."""
1,Romay should keep her clothes on,"I have one other Jesus Franco film with Lina Romay starring in it (Ilsa/Greta/Wanda The Wicked Warden/Mad Butcher), and in it she is young and beautiful. That film was made circa 1977, and some 25+ years later here she is in Franco's Lust For Frankenstein. I don't believe anybody who buys Franco films is hoping to see a woman in her mid-50's at youngest, complete with liverspots and vericose veins, expose herself and have love scenes. Please, if you have any common sense, stay away from this movie. I wonder if the late Soledad Miranda (Franco starlette/lover who died young) would be still doing movies if she were alive....."
1,lust for frankenstein,"The women on the cover are NOT in the movie. If they are it is very brief because I seem to have missed it. The main character is not sexy. She is probably in her 50's and has skinny legs, no ass and a bit of a tummy, if that's what you like then maybe you'll like this. I found myself questioning if I should even finish watching it or just turn it off."
1,A master dud from a master,"Made in 1996 this was one of Jess Franco's last movies and one of his worst. His wife is the ""seahag"" and while she may be beautiful to Jess she is not to movie viewers.No plot, cheesy music ,unattractive women, there is nothing to recommend this movie. If this is the best Mr. Franco can do now he should rest on his laurels."
2,Sand Castle,Certainly not Robert Munschs best work. Hard for a four year old to follow and remain interested in.
2,Out there,"This is a story that makes no sense and it's so out there that I find it frustrating. I don't really enjoy his style of writing, but this one is really too much."
2,"Good filter, very bad filter oil","I put this in my 1997 Jaguar Vanden Plas. There was a noticeable improvement in gas millage. After 6 months, I washed the filter, let it dry then misted it lightly with K&N filter oil per the instruction. 2 days later the cold air sensor, thru put sensor, and retard return circuit fault all reported errors. I disassembled the whole intake line for cleaning up but still could not clear the cold air sensor and retard return circuit errors. I ended up brought the car to dealer for service that cost me $880. I still have it in my car. I washed it again and misted it with very very light oil. If you want to put this in your car, be careful, K&N filter oil has been reported to cause trouble with intake sensors in many modern cars. I just bought 2 filters for my Jaguar Super V8 and Mercedes E350. I washed them out of the box and applied a very very light mist of oil. So far so good."
5,Great figure!,I was very pleasantly surprised at the super quick delivery. This is a great hard to find figure and I got her at a great price too.
5,Mon ablum préféré du semestre...,"I always have an album to define my semester its so weird. Paradize was my Spring 2003 ablum. I absolutely love it, especially since I'm a French Literature major :o). Its awesome if you could understand the words. I find what he says to be amusing and very French! ""les américains et les chinois abolissent la peine de mort, je vous prédis dans ce pays joie et bonheur.""My favourite is of course LE MANOIR. This song is simply AWESOME!!! I recommend this album even if you don't speak French. It's different and its always awesome to veer away from that horrible American pop on the radio."
3,Difficult installation,Definitely a two person job and getting the rack over the muffler of an RX 300 is tricky. Holes didn't exactly line up so a fair amount of muscle was needed to get the rack on. Overall a difficult install.
2,finally just tossed it into the trash,"This works, sort off. Just way too messy, inconvienent, time consuming and too much work. The back reflector is cheap metal that won't clean off, the shishkabob thingy is too dificult to thread to the rotor; all in all, not worth the time and trouble. And practically a worthless warrenty"
4,I'm a believer! Buy this and You'll love it!,"OK. I was skeptical. Popiel? Ronco? And if you buy right now, you get a GINZU knife! Names from past TV commercials that I buzzed through via videotape. I owe them an appology. This rotisserie does absolutely everything as promised/advertized. We've done a beef roast, three chickens, and two turkey breasts. If your chicken is around 4-lbs, one hour and you've got tasty food... same with the turkey breast.The best thing is the price! I don't know of anything else I've spent $35 on that has given me as good a return (except for some Microsoft stock I bought many years ago ;-} ) Certainly not any kitchen tool.The video tape is rather dumb. I don't inject my food. I probably won't do fish as I don't want to risk the chance that the appliance will smell like fish for the rest of its life. But I can honestly recommend this to anyone. It's fantastic!SET IT AND FORGET IT!"
3,It's smaller than it looks,"Note the dimensions. The board and checker pieces look standard-sized in the photo, but they are about one-third smaller than I was expecting. I guess it really is more of a toy than a game. The quality of the board and pieces is high, however."
4,Easier than hand staples,Great for the job! You need a lot of pressure to ensure good staple penetration. Would not be economical for commercial use but great for home and hobby use.
4,"Great film, not the best DVD","This is an amazing documentary. While only 26 minutes in length, it captures the essence of Rodin's art better than any other one I have yet seen. It does a great job of narration and voice over using Rodin's quotes and the low budget hand held production actually enhances the emotional effect of the artwork.Sadly, this is a poor quality DVD clearly just copied of a VHS tape and has some hick-ups during playback. But you have to be glad that somebody saved this film from extinction."
4,A comprehensive collection,"This compilation is an excellent collection of Frankie's hits. Fifteen of his twenty-five Hot 100 hits are here, including all of his Top 10's and twelve out of thirteen Top 40's. The sound quality is also excellent on this German import, with many tracks in stereo. Recommended."
1,Hopeless,"'Romeo and Juliet in Jerusalem' really was the pits as far as fictional literature goes.I found this story to be very slow moving and predictable. The plot was uninspiring and fails to in captivate the reader. One becomes very bored after only a few pages. There were a lot of ridiculous ideas being conveyed i.e. the idea that Moroccan Jews are discriminated against in Jewish society because of their Arab-like appearance. The characters made unrealistic declarations to each other and happily divulged private and personal information to complete strangers. Everything was so Americanised to the extent that the story wouldn't look out of place had it been set in New York.This was a very poor collection of stories conveying the message that Christianity is superior to all other religions. Islam is the fastest growing religion whilst Christianity is on the wane therefore, if anything, it is superior. Avoid this poorly written book at all costs."
5,Open-Minded Account of the Israeli Situation,"I was deeply moved by this book. It approached the whole Jewish - Muslim conflict from an open-minded perspective. I have read too many books written by Jews -- most of them Zionists or closet Zionists -- who give an inaccurate and biased picture of the whole situation. In contrast, I found Kim's book balanced and tolerant. I feel that there is a Jewish conspiracy out there in terms of print-journalism and journalistic writing (just look at all the Jewish names of jouranlists and writers on Israel issues!). We need a balance -- and Kim provides a fair balance."
4,Great for the price,"This is somewhat a case of getting what you pay for, but it is not so in an overly negative way. The wood is all unfinished and could probably use a layer of urethane or lacquer for a bit of protection against accidental bumps. All told, however, the quality is decent if not fantastic. The hinges and locking mechanism align well, which is not always the case in bargain level boards for classic self-contained playing boards for any game. As someone who likes to travel with his strategy games I have paid far more for lesser quality on strategy, chessboards and GO boards.As others have mentioned, the board is small and the pieces are light, but it is a minor inconvenience for the casual player. I'm sure that those who are more advanced and play more rapidly may have an issue, but this is an above average deal for the beginner to intermediate player."
2,very strange,this movie is ok. it is very strange and not at all scary. it is all about a deformed guy who goes crazy. buy it if you are up for a cheap thrill.
2,Simulated Mutant Sex. Nuff said...,"The only reason to see this movie is to check out the two ""heads"" having sex. Which means the movie is really not worth seeing..."
3,good sequel,"... but a far cry better than Basket Case 3. Henelotter has a great imagination and wonky sense of humor. I originally saw thes out of order, but the trilogy viewed sequentially looks better structured on re viewing."
2,mwadewht,More filler than true hits. Some of their best known songs are left off. Random order. INXS was much better than this.
5,excellent as expected.,a really great compilation all the great songs together . if your looking for a great inxs cd this is it .
3,Kick is better...,"I can't believe Kick isn't on there?!Kick is the better album to buy if you can only buy one, it's consistently higher energy from start to finish."
3,Interesting but Flawed,"I thought I knew INXS, from seeing the videos on MTV and owning a video they made. But after listening to this album, about 10 times, I have to conclude that I do not know the complete picture. I looked forward to singing along with their hits. But this album has all sorts of songs that I never heard. I guess that comes about from listening to their hits alone and not buying any of their albums--as far as I know--other than this album.May be I have missed something about INXS, since I'm middle-aged. This could have been an excellent album. But it is not."
3,Beware.... Edited!,"While this is a great CD, in that INXS has produced great music, the creators of this compilation did us all a disservice by cutting out chunks of certain songs... I imagine in the interest of cramming more songs on there. One of the best lines INXS created ('it's hard to believe we need a place called hell..'), and a lovely bridge out of ""Beautiful Girl"" have simply disappeared. outrage! I suppose there are others I have not caught yet, as well...."
4,Why do we need another INXS compilation?,"Let me tell you why. This one is about half the price of ""Anthology"", THAT's why! ""Same tracks"" blah blah blah...yeah, again, for about HALF the price, and it is ONE CD! Good enough reason for me."
3,How many INXS compilations do we need?,"I normally wouldn't comment like this, but being that there is already INXS's greatest hits and their anthology, which is rather new and complete, I don't see why there is a need for a best of. It seems that the surviving members are trying to bleed what they can out of people. There is almost nothing here that isn't available on the anthology, which is probably the best compilation anyone could own by INXS. This compilation doesn't even include songs like Elegantly Wasted and like all the other compilations misses Mediate. I know nothing of the new tracks, but I don't think they make this worth buying over the anthology. I do suppose this compilation is a bit better than the original greatest hits, and if someone is really only looking for just one disc, then this is better than the original greatest hits. You may do better though to just buy Kick or X which contain over half of their greatest songs anyway."
2,This is the Best?,"The title of this album is definitely a misnomer if they think this is the ""Best"" of INXS. While it does have many fan favorites, there are many tracks noticeably absent. I know this same criticism comes up every times a band releases a greatest hits album, with fans saying their favorites songs weren't included, but this isn't about the album missing my personal favorite songs, it is missing legitimate ""hits."" Where is Mediate (not technically a single), Heaven Sent, The Stairs? How could they not put the most popular self-titled track ""Elegantly Wasted"" on an album of ""The Best?"" With the band no more, this should be the final ""greatest hits"" album, yet somehow they manage to screw it up.The bonus unreleased tracks are mediocre, but don't belong on an album that is already missing several notable favorites. Even though it was produced seven years earlier, ""INXS - Greatest Hits"" is a superior album to this one, and I would recommend it over this poor sequel."
3,Great... but it still misses some important tracks,"This compilation includes By My Side and Not Enough Time, but it doesn't include Heaven Sent. On the other hand, Anthology does include Heaven Sent, but it doesn't include By My Side. INXS is a great band, I must admit it is one of my favorites, and I know there are millions of fans like me around the world. Can we please have a COMPLETE compilation?"
3,incomplete,"Although it contains several great songs ""The Devil Inside"" was incomplete. The Last stanza (look at the world) was missing."
2,Sad to give a negative review.,"I was really looking forward to watching ""Till the Clouds Roll By"", but the sound quality is wretched. How disapointing! The story itself is pleasant and the staging of the musical numbers would have been such a treat if it weren't for the awful sound track.The audio for ""Stage Door Canteen"" was a little better, and the story line was mildly engaging."
5,Love it!,"I am having so much fun with these CD's. I love the songs. I have most of the movies with the songs on them and it is awesome to be able to enjoy the music without having to watch the movies. How can you go wrong with artists like Bing Crosby, Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Judy Garland, etc. The recordings sound amazing. I love the nostalgic feel to them. So glad I own this!"
5,One of the best cds I ever bought.,"What an amazon collection of songs! This is bar none my favorite cd just because of the variety and the quality of songs on it. I love music from this era, and this cd is the perfect companion to my life. Love it! Buy it, you won't regret it for a moment!"
4,Went on without a ... hitch!,"First one from an Amazon seller did not come packaged nor did it have any mounting hardware at all - just the receiver. Amazon was very fast at issuing a return authorization and I got it sent back.The new one arrived shortly thereafter and it was in a box with all the hardware and literature.My car has the factory trim around the bottom of the car and this receiver fits very well. I didn't look at the instructions - yes, typical for me - but I figured that the installation was self explanatory. I used a bit of blue loctite on the threads of the included bolts and torqued to spec. No issues for hauling a bike or two. Blends in very well with the car and is quite unnoticeable."
5,Excellent Choice,Excellent choice for my Matrix. Price. Quality Product. Fast Shipping.Ease of Installment. I'm Pleased with purchase...
1,do not order this item!,"I had the same problem as the previous seller. The item did not come packaged and did not have any mounting hardware - just the receiver. I notified Amazon about the problem and they immediately processed another one to be shipped to me. However, the second shipment was exactly the same as the first - just the receiver. I had to lug these two heavy pieces of metal to the postal service to return it. What a hassle. Now I'm still waiting on my refund."
5,Excellent book for children and adults,This book wraps up many beautiful teaching about life. It is excellent for people of all ages and from all over the world. I highly recommend this book.
5,Great for beginners,"This is one of my favorite children's books. Sweet and a little sad. I'm an intermediate Spanish speaker and this book is great for learners. We also own the English version, so it is nice to see how it translates from one language to the other."
3,Black and White,"This book had a good story, though a bit above my 3 year olds comprehension. I think it would have held his attention better if the images had been in color."
1,Awful story,"I bought the book after reading the good reviews. I read it myself before reading it to my 3 year-old son, as I always do. What a horrible story about an egocentric, self-centered child. I felt so sorry for the tree. It is so sad. How can anyone enjoy this book is beyond my understanding. The parallel some people make with parents and children makes it even worse; a son that takes, takes, takes and NEVER gives anything in return? Not even vultures do that. Nothing to be learned from it so straight to the garbage can it went. What a waste of money."
3,wished it were longer,very interesting premise with colorful characters. the book is short and leaves you wanting more storyline. an enjoyable read that ends a bit abruptly.
2,Lame. Totally lame.,"I picked this up to complete my Team Associated motif, and because I figured a ""Factory Team"" set would be really high quality.I was wrong.To be honest, this is Harbor Freight junk that I could have bought for 1/4 of the price, except it says ""Factory Team"". An hour in to building a B44.2, and one wrench is bent, another is almost totally rounded off -- and it's not like I'm torquing these screws to death.Save your money."
2,Emotionaless and Forgettable,"I didn't dislike this book but it was a bit of a chore to get through. It told the tale of a black community trying to figure out their new freedom. It followed the life of Sister Mary and her dozen children. None of the characters particularly stood out to me and I wasn't really taken in by the narrative. It was interesting from a historical perspective, but I would have liked to see more emotion coming from it, or being elicited from me.In summation : I can't say that I'm particularly thrilled to have read this, nor do I expect it to stay with me for long. This is one of those books that a year from now I will be unable to recall much about."
3,Hmm...,"I'm not really sure what I thought of this book. Mary was an interesting character, and watching her go through life, raising her kids, and dealing with a somewhat harsh life was interesting. She lives on an old plantation, after slaves have been freed. She walks a different path than many of her neighbors, and because of this she is often called a sinner, though she enjoys her life as much as she can and doesn't wish to sin. I wasn't bored while reading the book, but I wasn't devouring each page either. The ending was a little abrupt, and due to the religious nature of the book, I'm not really sure that I got the overall message. It was an easy read though, and a relaxing one."
1,"Buy Volumes 1-3, but forget Volume 4","I have greatly enjoyed Volumes 1-3 of these recordings. They give generous samples of a wide variety of Tibetan music ranging from several kinds of chanting to traditional folk-dance types of insturmental music that include varieties of percussion instruments. The fidelity, sterio seperation and general mixing are all excelent for field recordings made in the early 1970s. But Volume 4 was a real disappointment to me. The quality is fine, but all the tracks are single (folk-song) vocals with little or no instrumentation by singers who don't sing very well. Some people may appreciate this, but I never want to hear this CD again."
1,Very Boring,"The book was simply ""blah."" Reading it was like trying to walk through shoulder-high mud--slow going. Trying to maintain an interest in Bessie was difficult. I eventually gave up. I have not read anything else by this author but hope other works are better."
2,"Rambling, dense and intellectual","Margaret Drabble is most definetly a very intelligent woman but I totally agree that her personal stake in this material was too deep and the reader is often left adrift. The historical details of early 20th century england is fascinating as well as the main charachter's descent into the negative oppressive options of menopause. I was bored and lost with the material, the DNA business, the archeaological digression and the author's idolization of Faro (sorry I didn't feel that way about this charachter - why should the writer impose this patronization?) Its a good lesson to would be writers: mind your audience or beware."
1,No Nabakov she,"In all fairness, I didn't finish this novel so I can't attest to its literary qualities. The reason I didn't finish is because Drabble gets the essential details on the Peppered Moth Experiment, which provides the central genetic metaphor for the book--plus its title--ass backward. And she muddles other details. If she can't be bothered to get this right, I can't be bothered to read the book. There are some other silly things, too. Such as the character who wins the ""Nobel Prize for Molecular Biology."" There is no such prize. Nabakov criticized fiction writers for not getting right the details of the natural world. It's okay to change the details for some fictional purpose, he said, but the author should at least learn the truth first."
1,Your life is too short to read this book,"There are two good things about this book. First, the cover art is outstanding. It is what drew me to buy the book in the first place. The second good thing, is that despite its incredible ability to seem to go on forever, there is indeed, mercifully, an ending. As I staggered to the ending all I could think about was not how good the book was, but my determined, but silly need to say that I finished it.The book should have been called the Wandering Moth instead of the Peppered Moth. The book wanders from the past to the present and back and forth, back and forth, till one is thoroughly sick of it. The book wanders from one character to another, always too late for the reader to have anything but disgust for the character just left.A quote from the book. ""A pity and a waste"". Yes, it was a pity the author wrote it and a waste for me to read it. Another quote, ""Unimportant people, in an unimportant place"". That, in a nutshell, is what the book is all about."
2,Don't read this book.,"This book was boring, plain and simple. I understand the cycle of tryany and abuse, one generation to the next theme... but really, what is the point. A book should tell a good story, one that is entertaining, one that makes the reader ponder the feelings of the characters or events that take place. I got none of this from this book. It did not speak to me. I labored through reading it because once I start a book I always finish it, but for this one it was a real chore."
5,Compelling and intelligent.,"Drabble's novels all reflect a level of intelligence missing in much writing today. The Peppered Moth is no exception. It's a compelling story and fascinating character study, intelligently written. Afterwards I felt I knew all the characters personally and wished I could pick up the phone to chat with them. There are too few books written these days as excellent as this."
5,What happened to Eleanor Dare?,This third book in the Lyon Saga series tells what may have happened to Eleanor Dare and her baby Virginia. They headed inland in search of other colonists. An exciting story full of danger at every turn. Highly recommended!
4,lots of action romance and adventure.,"I think this was a great book. It told things simply and was easy to understand. I loved all the romance and adventure. In fact the only thing I didn't like was the ending. I couldn't believe you would just end it like that. It really was unfair. I think books should end on a HAPPY expectant note, not a ANXIOUS expectant note."
5,It's as if Billie invited you to look through her scrapbook,"It's as if Billie invited you to look through her scrapbook of newspaper clippings, posters, photos, letters and recording dates. One could pick nits (she sang in Charleston WV, not Charlestown, and appeared on the Amateur Hour in 1938, not 1937), but no nit should keep anyone from picking this book for their collection on Lady Day. It's her life day by day from 1937 until her tragic 1959 death. One is transported to the era of jazz and feels like a member of the road band along for the ride through Vail's exhaustive work"
5,Acting like a Bull in a Bear market,"In this book, Wade tells you what causes a Bear Market; higher interest rates and lower earnings. By following the advice in this book, my portfolio acted like a Bull during a Bear Market.Wade writes in a easy, enjoyable style and packs a lot of information in a small book. I also recommend Safety First Investing [Wall Street MM #4] and of course Wall Street MM #1 and #2-Stock Market Miracles.Great books. Packed with information."
1,audio disc,I now have two books and have yet to receive the audio disc which I originally paid for .I DON'T WANT THE BOOK! I ORDERED THE AUDIO ONLY!Darl Shipley
2,Missed Opportunities,Warners is releasing all of the Red skelton movies of the late 40's and early 50's-good news. Bad news is they are releasing them separately on dvd-r at $20 each-dvd-r means NO subtitles or extras of any kind. These should have been released as a collection subtitled and reasonably priced. Warners is showing NO respect for people that need sdh and are being greedy and not very smart. They actually would sell more product and create good will my way. The dvd-r's are an insulting new wave by certain companies. What a shame!!!
4,Great Fettuccine,I love this Squid Ink Fettuccine. It's rare to find in the markets but I was glad I found it on Amazon. It cooks fast and taste good.
2,"came too late, and noodles are all broken!","i guess you shouldn't order these noodles over the internet, because they came all crumbled up. I haven't cooked them yet, so can't say anything about the taste, etc, but I definitely won't be twirling them on a fork, they're all about 2-3"" long."
1,Do all Fettuccine taste equally mashy?,"I gave it one star because they don't taste like pasta at all. They tasted mashy even cooked for just 1 1/2 minutes, and the brand is called Al Dente?Yes, I did cook them according to instruction the first time - in 3 minutes, then I did it the 2nd time in 2 minutes, and the 3rd time in 1 1/2 minutes, what should I do with the rest of 3 packs? (They are sold in a 6-pack deal.)"
1,Not Kosher,"This cannot be certified Kosher if it contains squid ink which is never, ever kosher. Misleading and offensive."
1,Worst poker book I've ever read.,"Title says most of this. I learned VERY little from Silberstang. I'm on my third read.Silberstang has a habit of showing examples without showing IDEAS. He says ""If I had this hand, and that fell, I'd do this."" Well, that settles that. But I'd like to learn a few concepts, to go with my facts.I mostly play low-limit games, where the tables are loose. YMMV, but I found Silberstang useless and poorly written."
3,not very good,"This book takes a lot of pages to say very little. Also, he assumes that you are familiar with a lot of poker lingo that he doesn't define (some of them I still don't know). There is a small glossary in the back, but most of the terms he uses are not in there. The book also lacks an index.Probably the biggest drawback is that mostly he gives specific examples than general guidelines. For instance, if you have Ace-Ace-ten, here's what you do. These examples will rarely occur, and he needs to give general principles instead."
5,Great with the book!,My daughter loved it! Cute little nutbrown hare! She reads it with the book very frequently!!!! Goes with the bigger one...
5,"Erotic, sensitive collection with great insight and feeling","In this day, a collection of short stories dealing with the sexual interaction between adult men and teen-aged boys is always a dangerous undertaking. But the authors approach the subject with humor, sensitivity and remembered insight of how it felt to be ""of that age"" ie: emotionally half formed, physically adult but restricted by the conventions of society at large."
4,I liked it,Even Pagans need academic writings. Very well written and quite lovely actually. I wish there were books like this written for every god.
4,Yes Wow!,"Good stuff. Got this before the whole Dead Weather thing which I like too. Stick it in whatever genre you want, it's just good hard bluesy rock. Guy on guitar, woman with tons of 'tude on the mic. Fairly simple, nothing too complex, but they make alot of noise with what they have and layer it well. ""Love Is A Deserter"" is kick ass. ""Dead Road 7"" is a cool slow builder. I might call the best track ""The Good Ones"". It's just got a killer groove to it. Listening to this album makes me wanna start smoking again. Put on the ol' leather jacket, go for a drive. Bang a sexy brunette. You know...sex, drugs and rock & roll."
2,Poor follow up to to a good first album,"First album was great, this is not as good. There are one or two good songs but too many very average ones."
5,"Excellent CD, if you enjoyed the movie it is a must!!",I really fell in love with a couple of songs in this version of Scrooge. I was happy to see the soundtrack was available. In listening to the CD it was quite moving and I really enjoy the song that is in the graveyard scene. If you are a Scrooge fan this is well worth getting.
2,"Cute, but the Broadway Production is Better!","This is the 2004 film version of Alan Menken and Lynn Ahren's ""A Christmas Carol"". The production is radically different than the broadway version with much less music sung, much lighter orchestration, and some truly akward rewrites.I would recommend the more powerful orchestra and better vocal talents of the broadway version if possible."
3,Pas terrible.,"Voici un tres bon film pourtant avec une scene terrible. Imagine si on a mit deux cochons qui volent au milieu de le film ""the matrix."" Autrement un tres bon film."
1,Dangerous conducting...,"As the only recording of the Sixth available I bought this CD and I still keep this CD. However this conductor does not demonstrate any understanding of Schnittke's music. This is so painfully clear with the interpretation of the Seventh once compared to the recent Poliansky recording on Chandos... I just pray for Poliansky to record the Sixth soon so I can dispose of maestro Otaka's heartless, mindless recording!"
2,not for the GO model 8000,I don't know about any other models but this burner is at least an inch shorter than the original in my model 8000 Great Outdoors grill.
1,NOT A VASE !!!,"This thing is a paper weight, not a vase. DO NOT BE FOOLED. Although it is pretty, it is not what it appears to be and definitely not some kind of vase. The company that labeled this as a vase is misleading you."
3,Brubeck on a personal recorder,"I bought this CD because it had a track with Brubeck and Baker featuring Desmond on alto and Mulligan on baritone. If you are a Chet Baker fan boost the rating to a 4, if exclusively for Brubeck demote it to a 2. Why a ""2""? Because the only cut on the album where the crowd noise is as loud as the instruments is this one. The sound goes right over the top of the recorder, obviously not professionally recorded, and it sounds just like you are sitting next to those who are cheering, whistling and clapping.I bought it elsewhere and paid half what they charge here, but even then it's a 3. 'nough said."
3,Inexperienced But Some Gold Nuggets,"Although the Motley Fools have shown their inexperience, like some of us knew they would, they have also started maturing. Much of their advice is generic enough to be good and hardly any of their advice is ""bad"" (like much of their competition). Also, there are some gold nuggets later in the program, so it is worth a listen if you are at any transition points in your life."
4,Advice is just ok,"This book is filled with investment wisdom. I enjoyed hearing about the story about the early days of [...]and how they were anxious to grow it as quickly as possible without having a defined business plan. What they were doing was trying to raise capital not to bring the company to profitability, but to simply grow larger so that they could raise even more capital later on.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"
2,I've had enough!,"I didn't want to go to a one because some of it was useful. Their admission on how poorly they performed in the market downturn says it all. So now they're saying, along with countless others, ""We have the best hindsight of anybody!"", rings absolutely hollow. Very bland humor too.If you've read or heard them before, there's no need for this one. Try to find somebody who has beaten these bad times."
1,Where's the Beef,"I listened to the first tape of this two tape series. I could not beleive what I was hearing. A Harley biker who lost his shirt in the downturn was given the advise that he should have stuck to what he knew: invest in Harley-Davidson stock. Great 20-20 hindsight! I kept listening through the end of the first tape, and could not take any more. Incredible nonsense. With their advise and $... you can buy a capucino."
3,It is an okay product,"When first taken out of the box, the product looked used. The metal parts had scuff marks on it, like it had either been used and returned or a display model. But it went together fine and has worked out okay. My 8 year old son is somewhat frustrated with it in that if he hits the portion of the net in front of the back cross bar, the ball hits that and does not return, so the 'target' needs to be higher or lower than that."
4,Wake Up and Rejoice!,"This band is such a breath of fresh air! Talent abounds. They'll creep on you. About the 3rd or 4th song is when it hits you and you ""get them"". Great work guys!"
5,Berwald: The Complete String Quartets,Berwald: The Complete String Quartets is a recording played by the Yggdrasil Quartet on this BIS recording from 1996. Julius Wender has written the music notes. The sound is very clear and it feels as if one is listening to this live. A very fine recording indeed. Highly recommended. 5/5.
1,very disappointed,"If you own the Batman Beyond DVDs, you don't need Batman Beyond The Movie. This item consist of the first four episodes from disc one of the first season. If your interested in this , just buy the first season of the series its worth it.Batman Beyond the series is a great edition to your DVD collection, if you happen like Batman the animated series."
4,Worth getting even if you have the season 1 box,"The ""movie"" is the 2-part intro to the Batman Beyond series and is worth getting in this ""movie""-ized format if 1) you're a big fan and 2) the price is right. Every few years when you pop it into the dvd player you'll get to enjoy the 2parter in a straight 44 minutes of awesomeness without part1 end credits and part2 intro credits breaking up the flow. I put the disc in a simple dvd sleeve and store it in the Season 1 case as this ""movie""ized version of parts 1 and 2 is the preferred way to see that 2parter."
4,Beyond The Spirit Of The Bat,"I gave the video 4 stars, only because I wish it were longer. I am 26 years old and I will always be a batman fan. The rebirth was truly a batman story of revenge and good versus evil. I like the idea of Bruce teaching his dark ways from the past to the new generation of hero. While still wet behind the ears Terry shows improvement as the plot thickens. He will continue to grow as time goes on. Proving one thing...the spirit of the bat will never die."
5,"""Batman Beyond"" Awesome!","What a GREAT show! Batman Beyond is definently the BEST animated 1/2 an hour show around! I can only hope to see more of this AWESOME show. So tune in on the Kid's WB! Check your local listings. I'm 58 and it's still timeless. You have to watch this with your family, all mine watch this GREAT show! It's so ahead of it's time. So keep up the GREAT work on this show!"
3,Batman Beyond is ok?,"I wish they would leave this Batman Craze alone. Give some other superhero a chance, like Auqaman or WonderWomen, we need a lot more animated superheros in the spotlight. I also would like to see Robin in his own series, as Nightwing. Don't get me wrong i like Batman Beyond it's just keeping the same super hero alive. Different is the key!!!! Give someone else a chance!!"
4,Cool show about Batman,"This video is awsome. However, Transformers would kick his sorry little but anyday (also on the WB, called Beast Wars at the moment or Beasties if your in Canada). But if you are a Batman and an animation fan this is defently a steal."
1,"5 stars for the series, 1 star for this DVD",Let me start out by saying I love the series Batman Beyond. This DVD is six of the first episodes are on this thing churned out by Warner Bros to make a quick buck. For less than twice the price of this DVD you can buy the whole 1st season of Batman Beyond. Save your money and boycott these quick cash garbage DVDs.
4,hope they repackage all the warnerbrothers movies,i like that thay have repackaged some of the movies i hope they repackage all of them to the keep case and release them all in season packages the like batman.
5,Season 2 was fine tunned,This was the season when Tisha's acting ability showed through and through. Such a beautiful woman indeed. Any fan of hers would love this season.
5,Best TV show ever!,"The shipping was SUPER fast! I think my favorite episode from this season was ""No Justice, No Peace"". I ALWAYS end up crying laughing watching that one."
5,I DON'T BELIEVE IT!!!,"Two seasons in less than 6 months? It must be the end of the world! Why not just release them every other month, we true Martin fans will snatch them right-up as soon as they come out. We waited long enough."
5,Martinnnnnnn,"I'm glad that the Martin series is coming along. This is the best show ever, and there is none other like it. I'm in Iraq and I pre-ordered my copy and started watching the day that I received it. Makes my time a little easier when I can have some laughs, hurry with Season 3."
5,marty mar,"We love Martin still and my husband was away and needed something to make him smile/laugh and I found this. He loved it and we still watch it, along with the other seasons!!!"
5,You Go BoY! Season 2 Rocks,"Shows soo good, my two boys 11 and 12 are now hooked on Martin DVDs. A good showing of celebrity guests in this one. Favorite episode is when Martin fights Thomas Hitman Hearns---with that swollen head at the end. I almost choked to death laughing when it first aired back-in-the day.Only one thing, the title opening song is getting on my nerves, must fast forward always.Martin - The Complete Second Season"
1,Scratched Discs & Late Delivery,I got this order 3 weeks after I originally placed my order and the box was mangled. All the CD are scratched and I am having difficulty watching any of the episodes because of the scratches.I'm not going to purchase from this retailer again and I'd advise others against putting in any orders as well.
5,One of the Best Shows Ever,"Martin is BAAACCCKKK along with all your favorite characters from the show!-Sheenenh Jenkins: The crazy neighboor (You so crazy!)-Edna Momma Payne: Martin's mother (I love when she called Gina ""apple head"").-Jerome: the player of the year (Ooooh Ooooh I said Jerome's in da ha...ha...house...Watch yo mouth!)-Otis: Security cop (What you doing there boy?)-Dragon Fly Jones: fight teacher (Silence Silence! The fight scene at the ATM was FUNNY!)-Elroy Preston: car repair man (singing 'Don't you know no good'!)-Roscoe: snot nosed kid (Witch betta have my money!)-Bob: cool white co-worker (The whole party is out of control!)-King Beef: Action Movie Star (I must dance!)I miss Martin, especially since Reality shows took over. He was one of the best! I can't wait for Season 3!"
5,Great product,"This is a great product if you want another appliance in your home. We use it all the time. Watch the price though. I see ""unbeatable"" price is selling it for almost $30. You can purchase this product at Sears or from the Salton website for $19.99."
1,K-Tel Notorious For Not Using Original Recordings!,"All I had to do is listen to the song samples, and I could tell these aren't original recordings. K-Tel is pathetic. This collection is way over priced. I avoid anything with the K-Tel logo. I've had the original recordings of these songs, and they aren't even close. Especially Saginaw, Michigan. Awful, and not even close. If you are a serious music lover, and enjoy the original recordings stay away from anything that K-Tel puts together."
4,Good metal album,When I first bought this I liked it OK but I don't think I appreciated it as much as I should have. A couple decades later after giving this album a fresh listen it is really impressive. I'm going to have to look at some of the other albums that these guys have.
3,O.K. Cookbook,"This book was O.K. but the recipes had sugar, it was just in the form of fruit juice concentrate and not cane sugar."
2,"The I can""t believe this has no sugar""","I did not like this book too much because the sugar substitute that she uses sometimes, like rice syrup is very difficult to find. I do not recomend this book."
4,Diabetic,Recipes are great food is delicious. while I am not diabetic with a number of famliy members who are it is great to share the recipes I have persoally tested.
2,I can't believe this book will help anyone,"I was very interested in this book due to my recent diagnosis of pre-diabetes. I've been advised to steer clear of simple sugars, esp. white sugar, white flour, rice and potatoes. I thought this book would be a great addition to my cookbook library, but alas it was not. Unfortunately the authors simply omit white sugar from the recipes, but still include huge amounts of simple sugars through white flour and fruit juice concentrates. If you are specifically allergic to white sugar, then this book might be for you. If, however, you're a diabetic trying to cut out simple sugars I'd pass on this book."
2,Disappointing if you want it for the COOKIE recipes,"After reading the positive reviews, I bought this book. The introduction said ""a few"" recipes contain date sugar. When I went to the section on cookies, I found that all but three of the cookies recipes contain date sugar...usually 1 to 1.5 cups!There are many other books that focus on fruit-sweetened baking...if cookies are your interest, I'd recommend looking at others first."
5,Da Bomb,I've started reading this book and it is wonderful! and I am not saying this 'cause my dad wrote it
5,Excellent Product / Impressive Sound Quality / Very Nice Display.,"Comparing features of this product (line by line) with others similar units. I can say that the most important or remarkable are:a) Output - 70 watts per channel (280 watts total), it produces a very clear and powerfull sound.b) Very Nice and Colorful Display (buttons are iluminated too).c) Easy and Intuitive to use.d) CD Slot is located and protected behing faceplate (I mean is not part of it), it avoids that CD will be affected by dust, and it enables to have a complete display in the faceplate (because slot is not taking ""space"" from it).e) It has connections for optional and external amplifieres, subwoofer, and Auxiliar Input.Conclusion: Excellent product. I am fully satisfied with it. It was installed without any problem. It meets my expectations. I am very very happy with it."
3,Worked good until screen went blank,"I have had this stereo for 2 years now and the sound quality, value and features made it a good purchase when new. The buttons are a bit challenging when you are driving - unless all you plan to do is change the station or turn up the volume.After about 1.5 years of having it, the faceplate went blank. Buttons still light up - but no station display, volume, equalizer or anything else. It continues to work fine other then that - but you get to guess what station you are on."
4,Great Fun,"Lots of nostalgia since this anthology was put together near 30 years ago but surprisingly relevant. Silly basis but, as I said ""GREAT FUN"""
3,"A nice $10 gift item, not a nanobot bent on world domination.","Look this isn't a kit from Nasa. It will not be the robot building experience of your lifetime. However, it will kill an hour or maybe two with a child and then leave something neat for them to have on their shelf. You will not be programing this as a droid for etiquette and protocol. It is meant to offer a little bit of fun on a Saturday afternoon just after lunch but before you start thinking about dinner. Treat it like the 10 dollar gift item it is and everyone will be thrilled."
1,"flimsy, cheap","It's easy to put together, but the legs aren't strong enough to support the weight of the batteries, can, and motor. They start to bend immediately and the bug tips over almost right away once it's turned on. The kiddo put a lot of work into putting this together and was really disappointed when the legs kept giving out."
1,Very Poor Toy,"There is nothing good that can be said about this toy.It is incredibly hard to assemble with very poor instructions. The screws are VERY small and no child under 16 could assemble it without becoming incredibly frustrated. My boys were patient as I put the toy together over the course of 2 hours. The legs are nearly impossible to put on then offer no support so the toy immediately falls over.Then we turned it on. A WWII allied bomber made less noise than this toy. The box says ""It really is a vibration sensation"" when it should read ""THIS TOY IS REALLY LOUD and also it vibrates."" The vibration on the bad legs then causes it to fall over and the can to dislodge.If you kids crave yelling over a loud motor as a piece of plastic vibrates on the floor then this toy is for you. If not, I would stay away."
2,flimsy little guy,"this toy is....well...stupid. i'm not sure what i was expecting, but this wasn't it. all it is is a contraption that attaches to a can and vibrates to make it move. it wouldn't stay upright long enough to have any fun with it. my daughter 7, couldn't assemble it by herself. we were both disappointed with this toy."
2,Fragile and Unstable,The fun was in the making but the fun was over when we turned it on. The wire legs are whimpy and it just falls over and vibrates on the floor. Great idea poor materials.
1,OMG! This is lame!,"The shipping and packaging was great. Getting a soda can is easy enough. The educational value is decent because the kids get to understand how to build things. I was personally very exsited to build it. Some of the screws were very hard to get in. I almost hurt myself because I had to use a lot of force on these very tiny screws to get it together. I soon as I was done I started to wonder if I did something wrong. It only had 3 legs! But look at the box carefully and you will notice that there are only 3 legs on this thing. No balance, if any at all! Oddly enough it came with 2 more legs but with no way to attach them.If you can get it to balance, the vibrations from the motor will shimmy the object across the floor...very....very....slowly."
2,dissatisfied,I bought this product for my 10-year-old grandson. He was very excited with putting it together. Unfortunately we could not secure the legs enough to hold the bug upright. I finally fashioned new legs with coat hanger wire.
4,A Great French Film,"I bought this because I love the author of the book by the same name, E. Carrere. The scenery is beautiful. The acting is superb. The editting is masterful. The story itself is intriguing. I have watched this movie three times since I received it."
3,Ancient ambient cocktail music,"I recommend listening to the sample tracks before buying this music. One of my dance instructors mentioned Ali Jihad Racy in a workshop, but I wish I would have researched his music more extensively before buying this cd. ""Ancient Egypt"" is more ambient and moody than rhythmic and dance-able. It would be good for tea time or meditation."
2,not exactly 'Ancient Egypt',"The music has very nice slow melodies, but sounds Middle Eastern rather ancient Egyptian. I have to say I'm a little disappointed with it, since the music is more like modern Egyptian/Arabic than ancient ."
5,good mood music,"after seeing the tut exhibit, i had found the background music almost hypnotic. it added greatly to the images before me. i thought this would be pleasant to listen to at home. unfortunately, ancient styled egyptian music is hard to find. in some places even this cd has a more modernized, or slightly moroccan sound to it. yet, overall it's one of the better i've found so far. don't expect 8 pieces of music that are greatly varied in style and delivery. the variances are small, but the somewhat repetitiousness of sound adds to it's relaxation value. it can easily be used as a background music that puts you at ease, but doesn't distract you from your point of focus."
3,"Music to relax ,possibly meditate to, and enjoy","This cd is soft and pleasant. It sounded a bit more Asian than Egyptian. There weren't any drum beats used, so if you're looking for something a bit more melodic and soft, this is it."
4,Monkey see monkey do,"Original I Love Men album plus two tracks. Where's my man is a classic. Others make hilarious and happy athmosphere. Nothing to compare to her devilishly seductive 50's recordings, but a happy record with lots of bitchy laughter. This could have been made by Alexis Carrington-Colby-whoever if she could sing. The shameless eighties!"
4,Good new band,"A fast and hard Japanese Emo band. (English lyrics) They sound a little like old ""Weezer"" from the blue album but with more light hearted lyrics. Also a twist of ""Reggie and the Full Effect"" plus some ""Ultimate Fake Book"" styles thrown in for good measure."
3,"OK, I GUESS EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A STORY","THIS MOVIE IS BASICALLY SCENES FROM CHAN'S LATE 70S MOVIES. IT'S OK, BUT MAN, I WISH IT WERE DUBBED. TO PUT IT STRAIGHT, THIS FILM HAS NO STORY, JUST A COMMENTATOR TELLING JACKIE'S LIFE OVER A BUNCH OF SCENES FROM HIS MOVIES. GREAT FIGHTING SCENES FROM SOME GOOD MOVIES, BUT, THIS MOVIE COULD'VE BEEN A LOT BETTER. YOU REALLY HAVE TO ADMIT ONE THING, AFTER A WHILE, THE CANTONESE SPEAKING DOES BECOME AGGRAVATING TO LISTEN TO. AND ON SOME TVS, THE SUBTITLES MIGHT NOT BE SEEN TOO GOOD. WHILE IT DOES FAIL TO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT JACKIE CHAN'S LIFE, IT DOES CONTAIN SOME OF HIS GREATEST FIGHTS FROM HIS EARLIER MOVIES. FOR REAL, INSTEAD OF CALLING THIS ''THE INVINCIBLE FIGHTER; THE JACKIE CHAN STORY'', IT SHOULD'VE SIMPLY BEEN CALLED ''JACKIE CHAN'S GREATEST FIGHTS''. AN OK MOVIE IF YOU CAN BARE ALL THE CANTONESE THAT YOU HEAR THROUGHOUT THIS FILM. BUT REALLY, PLEASE RELEASE AN ENGLISH-DUBBED VERSION! IN CANTONESE WITH ENGLISH AND CHINESE SUBTITLES."
1,"Bad Quality, Chinese Spoken, No story","This DVD is one of the worst I have ever seen. You can tell now that not only new movies are available but also old once are burned to DVD.And beleve me this is an old one. I would discribe the quality of the DVD as a homevide super 8 movie take 30 years ago.The movie is spoken in Chinese, at least I think, and subtitles are in chinese and English.It seems it only works on 19:6 format since the subtitles were cut of on both sides of my 4:3 TV set.The story if there is any tells the way chacky chan came to be a master.Dont know to much about it. Looked the whole movie went to the kitchen opend the trash bin and disposed of it.So if any one gets the DVD its at your own risk."
5,Wonderfully Helpful for Both Birth and Adoptive Parents,"I am currently pregnant with twin boys that I will be giving up for adoption. I was looking for books to help me and the adoptive parents truly understand open adoption. I LOVE this book! I read through it in only a few days time and now the a-mom is reading it. I recommend this for both sets of parents, it is a GREAT resource!"
3,Redundant & Outdated,"They need to update/revise this book. It was written it the late 80's when open adoption was just beginning to take root. The book only goes as far as how open adoption affects elementary-aged children. The sections on teenagers & adults discuss how they are affected if you seek out an open adoption after years of closed adoption. I want to know how teenagers and adults who have always lived with an open adoption are affected. What is the end result when an openly-adopted child grows up? How do they cope?Also, this book is pretty redundant. It could have been about 100 pages shorter.Even so, it was informative and worth the read. I enjoyed reading the real-life stories of adoptive parents, birth parents, and their children."
1,Out of Date,Needs updating badly. I'd like to hear how adult children of open adoption feel now. This book is from the 1980's.
4,"Great way to organize ties, preferred over tie-rack, but...","Great way to organize ties, preferred over tie-rack, but you have to keep it 'balanced' out otherwise it tilts and ties will fall off. For example, if you have 10 ties, you'd have to place a tie on every other arm. Quality is so-so -- plastic molding leaves some sharp edges which aren't super frienly to fine silk ties, but if you are careful, no problems. I've bought 3 of them and prefer them over tie racks as it is much easier to see the ties IMO (looking from the top of the organizer); tie racks bunch the ties up too much IMO making it hard to see what is where... BTW: the wheel does spin independently of the hangar.Note: says 'some assembly required', but in all three of my purchases, came fully assembled."
2,Not great - but can't expect much for a few dollars,Pros: Cheap! Doesn't take up much room. Top fits into base piece - that's the full assembly - takes 5 seconds.Cons: Slightly flimsy and very plastic looking (that's because it is plastic!). May not hold as many items as stated. Don't see this lasting long.All in all - not bad for the money but not great either. I'll give it to my teenage son for the few belts and ties he has but he'll definitely want a new one when he's older.
1,DO NOT GET!,"Within five minutes of opening and assembling this item, it broke. The plastic is cheap and had to be super-glued together. Granted it's still together and holds plenty of ties well, it doesn't spin anymore. Go find something else."
3,"Simple, but great! But broke after 4 mos.","I purchased this for my boyfriend after reading many reviews, including ones about the motorized tie racks and am extremely happy! This item is small and simple, but works great! Easy to snap together, spins perfectly, ties hang great. I would definitely recommend this item.UPDATE: 4 MONTHS LATER - I was perfectly pleased with the function of this item, but then it broke. The piece that holds the ""twirler"" into the hanger - one of the plastic pieces that keeps it locked into the hanger snapped off and now we can't use it. Thought about superglue, but then you lose the ""twirl"" feature. Oh well, back to the drawing board!"
5,Best two dollars I've ever spent,"I bought two of these, and have them hanging next to each other. They fit 20 ties each and I love everything about these organizers."
2,"Nice idea, poor execution","I purchased this tie rack with high hopes--it appeared to be a compact and economical way to support my ever expanding tie collection. However, it feel far short of my expectations. It repeatedly got stuck on surrounding wire hangers (the kind upon which shirts return from the cleaners). The item then broke while I was untangling it from its neighbor."
1,Defective Design. Broken in less than 4 months.,"Granted these tie rack organizers were pretty cheap, so I went in to the purchase with pretty low expectations. I really didn't need a complicated electronic tie selector or anything overly complex. Unfortunately, I was disappointed even given the considerations I made prior to purchase. This design has a fundamental flaw. The hook fits into the rotating disk by a plastic prong. Over a period of about 2 months, using the organizer 4-5 days a week, the plastic prong has worn down. This allowed the disc to detach from the hook. It's no longer able to hold up the weight of the rack of ties without popping out. Your options at this point are either super-glue the two pieces together (and lose the rotation ability) or simply throw it away. I can not recommend it for purchase, unless you are only using it once a week or so. It's definitely not suitable for anyone who wears ties daily to work."
4,It is what it is...,"I bought this as a temporary tie solution. And you know what? For the price, I kind of like it. It's nothing fancy. It doesn't look amazing. But it works. Quite well. Nothing to complain about."
3,a low cost solution,"It is a simple solution to tie selection. Previosly,on an expensive tie hanger,ties ended upon the floor, holders broke when tie selection was made."
2,Poorly Designed,Works pretty good so long as you don't max out the capacity. At that point it becomes overloaded and you find your ties spread out on the floor. Will be looking for a better option.
5,Cheap and efficient,If you don't want to spend an extravagant amount of money on some fancy tie rack then this is for you. It gets the job done cheaply.
3,Flimsy,"This product is ok...it gets the job done, but I wish it felt a little more sturdy. You can't blame the product though, it's exactly what it claims to be. It hasn't fallen apart or anything, it just doesn't feel strong and secure like some more expensive ones."
2,"Great concept, poor execution",Would have saved a lot of space if not so cheaply made and inadequate for holding the ties properly. Caution.
5,Great buy,This is a great buy. I purchased it for my husband and he loves it! Looks exactly like the picture and it works great!
2,Cheaply made,Cheapo. Bought 2. One broke immediately. The cheap plastic hook snapped off. Should be made more sturdily. Wouldn't order another one.
1,"Took 3 weeks to deliver, so tightly wound you wouldn't fit a paperclip","Product is exactly as picture so I only blame myself for buying it. The links are so closely connected you couldn't properly fit a tie, much less a belt. It also took 3 weeks to come from China. At best this is a $.25 piece, if you purchase nothing but slim ties that you don't mind wrinkling. Perhaps I can stretch a cloth over it and turn it into a mini umbrella?"
5,Great Buy for Great Price!!,"I was searching for a tie rack as a gift. I had researched different types and decided on this one. It was very simple and convenient. No installation or fooling around with tools. Simply hang it up and throw your ties on it. The person I bought this for LOVED it!! When I need a new tie rack, this is the one I'm going to get."
3,tie organizer,Takes up more room than I would like but it does hold the ties nicely. When loaded with ties it doesn't turn very easy.
3,Not Bad,The item comes in very handy. I had more ties than I thought so it filled uo pretty quickly. Cheaply made but sturdy for its price. Delivery was fast. Overall satisfaction!
1,Doesn't work,Falls apart and is a waste of time - doesn't function as it is stated to work. Ties weigh it down and it falls on the floor
3,Okay,"I bought this for a belt & tie holder. it works fine and does its purpose, but when I overload it with belts it breaks. (the snap piece between the spinny part and the hook come apart. it can be placed back together but it seems that it keeps falling off more and more often. FOR TIES ONLY - GOOD."
4,Surprisingly useful for such a cheap plastic item,This rack is made out of cheap looking plastic and is not the most aesthetically pleasing but I have used two of them (loaded to capacity with ties and belts) for over a year and neither has broken or shown any wear. It is actually a great way of organizing numerous ties in a very small space. It can even hold belts but you have to use multiple legs to support each buckle if you choose to go this route. This item is very cheap but effective and sturdy if used as intended.
2,avg. at best,"impulse buy, i dunno why, but when i got it, i just didn't like it. i wouldn't get it again."
2,already broken,"I pull the rack a little bit and then broken. If you don't touch it, looking good in the drawer.The material is not strong enough."
2,Came to me broken,Product was half melted/broken. Not sure what happened to it. We decided to keep it since it was shipped from Hong Kong and could make it work anyways. It was cheap enough to no bother returning. Just wish it was not broken!
3,Super cheap and Plastic - but it Works!,"This comes in two peices and you connect them. It is supper cheap and plastic. But what can you expect for the price. On the other side it works and for the price I would by more and recommend them. However, i would not recommend putting belts on it, Just ties. Also you have to make sure you keep it balanced or it will hang very crooked. So when you hang ties on it make sure you spread them out to balance it out. Other then that i recommend it. 3.5 / 5"
3,Cheap but works,"The Good:It does work. It is easy to load and remove ties, even when they are spaced so closely. I had no problem balancing it as some people did. If you don't get it exactly balanced it tilts a couple degrees from plumb...so what? It spins making finding the ties in the back simple. No problems yet and I din't foresee any.The Bad:As cheap as it is, it is not cheap enough! This is ultra-low grade plastic that belongs in a dollar bin. It is hard to but a nice tie on such a low quality piece."
3,Twirl a tie rack organizer,"Seems kind of cheap, but it was, so you get what you pay for. It does what it says, holds your ties."
3,Inexpensive and functional.,"This item has a simple design. It holds around 20 ties with no problem. If you try to hold less than 20, it can hang off center and not rotate smoothly. It sits in the closet wider than I expected, but it is functional. Not bad for the price, but bulkier than I expected."
5,Great organizer for ties,"The Twirl-a-Tie, works as advertised. The ties hang neatly and are easily accessible. Very satisfied with this item."
5,Pleased,"Product is very lightweight and at first it seemed that it would be flimsy, but actually it's working very nicely."
3,"Not perfect, but gets the job done if you modify it","I've had this for approximately 8 months, and it works rather well as far as spinning and ease of use. Once I had completely filled it with ties, however, the round section began to repeatedly fall off due to the weight of the ties (and I'm talking one tie per rung, not multiple). To remedy it, I jammed a penny into the crevice of the section that pops through the hole in the round section, and it's worked perfectly ever since."
1,Cheap product,"Cheap product and you get what you pay for. It's a good concept, but the spokes are too short to fit all but the narrowest ties."
4,Great item,"This is a great little item - takes up no space in the closet and you don't have the headache of the other organizer types out there that require installation. I bought two and they're great - however, like other comments I had read, the shipping cost was very high. To do over, I would have made more effort to check a local store first for something comparable."
3,Cheap and effective.,"Got a couple of these for a friend who wears a lot of ties, and he seems to like it. It was a little more flimsy in person than I was expecting, but it does the job!"
4,not bad.,"you get what you pay for. It can't really fit a tie on every hook...you gotta go every other hook and then a few back to back here and there, but u cant do it for all of them. it takes up a little room, which is to be expected, but it's not a deal breaker. Overall, i think it's worth it."
5,Perfect,"The Twirl-a-Tie did its job perfectly. It is two pieces of plastic, simple and easy, nothing over engineered about the product."
4,Great organizer - Cheaply made,You have to expect that these arent the best in quality. They really help organize a closet though. I bought one a year ago and just recently I pulled a tie off a little to hard snapping it. If I had to buy one every year or two I would still say that its worth it.
2,Not recommended,This product is not really even worth the low price. It is cheaply made and not the best construction for holding ties. I'd recommend a more expensive one of a different design.
1,order takes too long,Ordered it for Christmas in early December. Found out it wont be here till sometime in January! I will return it...
1,Extremely poor quality,V. light weight and very small - ties keep on falling from it. totally useless and infact annoying.
5,Great item for what it is,"I bought this tie rack, b/c I needed something in-expensive to keep my ties organized. Being new to the corporate world, I have began accumulating quite a few ties. Previously I had them on a hanger, but the hanger kept falling apart. Also, it was very hard to remember the colors and designs of the ties I have. I found this tie rack on-line through a Google search, and could not be more happy. It is a simple concept that works. I will probably end up getting another one b/c I am still collecting more ties. I would highly recommend this product."
5,:),"If u have a lot of ties,.. this is for u. looks nice and organizes your ties well. A lot can go on this handy little rack. Deff a good buy."
4,Convenient Item,"Great little item to organize small things such as ties (original intent). I actually use it to organize my belts. They have a twirl-a-belt but the hooks on that version make it easier to use this one for belts that don't have traditional buckles. Furthermore you could use this for anything small that you need out of the way, such as scarfs. It's obviously super cheap and very small, but for something like this, cheap plastic is all we need. I just wish it was a little bigger."
4,Great product for price,"The organizer works well for quite a few ties. The only thing is that since it's plastic and not a ball bearing, it's not quite the easiest thing to twirl. However, I wouldn't spend any more money on a tie rack than this. Works, it's functional. I'd get another"
5,Terrific Product,Great product at a very low cost as compared to other tie organizers. Fits the tie size perfectly and allows my husband to see what he has at a glance. Prompt shipping. Definitely would recommend buying this product.
4,Basic,"For $5 it is definitely worth the price...it holds 20-25 ties and works perfectly. This is great if you don't want to spend the money on the electric tie machines...the only issue is whether or not it is worth the $5 or so in shipping...if you can get to a store to purchase, I would do so and save yourself the shipping cost. Overall, great value and a simple, but effective product."
2,fell apart,"even though it's cheap, don't waste you money, it's flimsy and fell apart. I'd rather pay twice the price and have something last"
3,great idea... but Like everything made in china... its CHEAP,I GUESS I CANT COMPLAIN ABOUT A $3 BUT AFTER A WHILE THE PRODUCT BREAKS DOWN AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT ALL YOUR TIES ARE ON TEH FLOOR. GREAT WHILE IT LASTS THOUGH!
1,ONLY ONE IN THREE PERFORMED PROPERLY,"""Wow! What a great product to organize my 40+ neckties,"" I thought as I placed my order for two of them. They were sent flat in two pieces per unit (hanging hook & rotating spindle) and the first one snapped together in a flash. When I tried assembling the second one the hook broke as I tried to duplicate my first success.""Oh Well,"" I opined. The cost was cheap enough and I could always just buy a replacement, which I did. When it arrived I carefully snapped the two pieces together and breathed a sigh of relief at my success. I rushed to gather up my remaining ties and when I returned the Tie Rack Organizer had fallen off the arm of my couch onto the carpeted floor where it laid broken into two pieces, utterly useless!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,"I bought this rack hoping it would help me stay organized. I liked the fact that it spins and does not take up much space. However, I put all of ties on and hung it in my closet... the INSTANT it was hung, it broke! What a waste of time and money."
2,Too Small,"I bought this for my BF so that he could have a way to organize his ties. I saw the low cost and 4 star rating and thought it would be a good buy. Unfortunately I was wrong. The sections are so close together that the ties end up being smushed. My boyfriend doesn't even use it. I havent tossed it quite yet, still hoping to come up with a creative use for it....maybe I can tie ribbons to it and use it as a cat toy..."
1,You get what you pay for...,"There's a reason these are cheap. They are cheaply made, and they fall apart with ties on them. The rack itself is made from two pieces of plastic. One is the hanger and the other is the portion that holds the ties. When the rack gets more than 1/2 full, the part that holds ties just falls off the hanger part. It kind of renders the whole product useless, in my opinion. Only way I got it to work was to super glue the pieces together, of course then it no longer rotates.Like I said, you get what you pay for."
4,"For what it is, it's perfect!","This little plastic jobber holds 20 of my favorite ties. It helped me wean down the selection to twenty, so goodbye Nature Conservancy tie, goodbye tie I've had since high school and goodbye tie that I wore as a groom at my first wedding! Seriously, if you have that many ties, buy two hangers! It is simple and does the job."
3,Does its job,"Probably the cheapest tie rack you can get that does the job. It holds ties, it spins (but its too small to really need to spin it ever), its made of really cheap plastic. Don't expect to hang anything but ties on it (i.e. don't think that you can put your belts or other items on it as well). Don't drop it or step on it either. So basically treat it like a tie rack and you will definitely get your moneys worth out of it like me.I give it three stars because the product does the job, but it is nothing special."
5,Great Product,Great product. Keeps all my ties in order and easily accessible in a compact space. Will definately be buying another one as my tie-collection grows.
1,Flimsy arrived broken,Although very inexpensive its not even worth it if it was free. It was poorly packaged and arrived broken. I have seen better plastic on disposable cutlery.Dont waste your money.
3,Twirl-a-Tie Tie Rack/Organizer,"Honestly I was surprised when I got it in the mail. It's very tiny! I expected a little bigger that, it barely hold my sash. I thought tie and sash is not much different in size, so I bought this to organize my sash..now I think I will use this to organize my belts instead."
3,Its okay,I have had this tie rack for about a month now and have to say I am disappointed. My husband picked this one because of its ability to twirl but there are too many cons that accompany that. First of all if you have an odd number of ties your rack will be off balanced. Also it does not hold 20 ties comfortably. When you fill the rack and try to remove one you end up snapping the rack part off of the hook part and your ties go crashing to the floor. All in all I could stand all the negatives with this rack if it stayed together but the fact that I am constantly picking the ties up off the floor are enough to send a person over the edge. I would not recommend this even for the measly 4 bucks!
4,Tie holder,"When I received this, I thought it was less than I had hoped for. Nope. I was wrong. It really holds lots of ties and I can find them easily with a quick spin. It is better that I expected."
3,Decent.,"You get what you pay for, and for the money I paid; the quality is pretty equal. I use only slim ties, and hung up about 12. It hasn't broken or anything and seems pretty sturdy so far. If I need another one at any point, I'll probably get the same one. I'd recommend it to others who don't have a big budget but need somewhere to hang their ties."
2,plastic,I expected it to be plastic but not that cheap plastic. I got what I paid for though. For a buck more I could have gotten some nice ones at Bed Bath and Beyond. Disappointed.
1,CHEAP plastic,"I was expecting something more substantial, it's a cheap plastic thing, not worth the money. I will have to find something better, this will not hold a tie."
1,Cheap!,"Took forever to get it. The minute I put it together,it breaks. I tried super gluing it and it didn't even work. Not worth buying. You pretty much get what you pay for."
1,This is really terrible,The package comes with two parts: a hook and the body. Right after I plugged the hook in the hole of the body it broke. This item is definitely not worth buying.
3,Tie holder,Small and kinda cheesey. It works - ok for the price. I was expecting a little better quality. I don't use it for my ties though - looking for something a little more robust.
1,Hangs to close to the closet rod,"We have really tall closets and our closet rods are high this makes it impossible to use this product. It hangs only an inch or two away from the rod so you can't reach it without knocking all the ties off. It's way overpriced too, considering it's just a couple of pieces of cheap plastic snapped together."
5,Good idea!,Ties do a get a tad crunched on it but this is a great idea for someone who might have a lot of ties but no good way to organize them! I dont really wanna mount a tie rack in my closet but i got tired of having htem in a box getting all wrinkled so this worked ideal for me!
1,Bad design,The hold fall apart if I put more than 8 ties on it. The product is very badly designed. I have a suggestion for the design. The company can contact me and I would be open to share the design.
2,Cheap,"Very cheap product, I could have probably just made something using some paper clips and can tops or something. Blah."
3,Works great but expensive,"This does the job wonderfully. But its nothing ""special"", its regular hanger plastic. For the price of this contraption, you could probably buy a couple dozen regular hangers. But given the options out there, this was the only one I liked."
5,Awesome!,Loved this item! It is a very good one to use if you are organizing your closet! I highly suggest it
3,"Decent product, not so useful.","There is nothing wrong with the product I received, and it works as advertised; however, I have found it not to be very useful. It doesn't save as much space as I thought it would, and I could probably save as much space by throwing all my ties on a coat hanger.One advantage to this product is if you are a neat freak or like things organized, it works better than just using a coat hanger to hang your ties on."
3,Almost too easy.,"This product is great, yet I only gave it 3 stars because of one major flaw it has. Weight distribution must be equal around all parts of the tie rack. I have many ties on it and two belts hanging from it. If I were to take one belt off, the weight of the tie rack would swing to the only belt left on it and most likely come crashing to the ground with my ties falling. While its not as bad if you do not plan on adding belts it will still be funky if the weight distribution isn't even on all sides. It simply will not twirl if your ties are not even around the rack because it's lopsided."
3,One gets what one pays for,"I bought two of these, and the first one snapped (the joining snap piece) immediately upon assembly. That being said, it's only two parts (hook and holder) and (if you can avoid snapping it) it is easy to assemble. Still glad I got them to save some closet space, but not surprised it broke so easily for the price."
4,tie organizer,Works great and met my expectations. An inexpensive tie holder to hang in a closet. Fast delivery and accurately described.
3,Great Continuation,We very much liked how smoothly this volume carries on the story in Zeman's Sindbad series. Very nice introductions to Sindbad for younger children.
3,It's no Fear of Flying,"This book was enjoyable, but nothing special. Every kind of shocking sexual situation you can imagine is in it, which gave me the impression that Jong was trying too hard to create a public sensation. Fear of Flying is one of my all-time favorite books, so I'll read anything by Jong, but this is the worst one of hers I've read yet. Still, if you're a Jong fan, you'll like it... not love it... but like it."
4,Go on an Adventure...,I loved Fanny. At first I had a rough time getting used to the fact that she seemed to capatilize every other word. This story upset me a lot at first but I kept reading in the hopes that something good would happen to this poor girl. This book is a wonderful adventure that every free spirit and especially every woman should read. Dont give up on it half way through either. See it all the way to the end. If ever I am bored I will reread Fanny again and go on her many wonderful adventures.
4,Great little cooker,"Makes the best roasted chicken we ever ate. Not the easiest to clean, nor is it the hardest. Worth the reduced price if you can find it."
2,Not a Video,"When I purchased this DVD I was under the impression that it was a video, (not)! This is only a DVD with a picture of the artist displayed on the screen while music plays."
2,Chopper Showman,"This book could have had half the number of pages. The focus is on the spiritual (indian?) side of Larry. It does paint an interesting picture of what he was like, but I found the comments of other builders in Art of the Chopper II more relevant. The recurring theme of life's mysteries and how they influenced Larry went on and on. It became a bit much. Nearly ruined a reasonable read."
4,Indian Larry wasn't a hero...,"This man didn't have an average live, I think it's one thing on everybody will agree...This was a good man, who just lived his life as he could, just like us, but with less compromise.The book is really interresting (even for people like me who've been already reading about him), the pics go from ""old Polaroid"" to very high quality (especialy regarding the bikes).The thing I really did not appreciate is the comparison between his life and a ""hero tale"". I think Larry himself wouldn't have appreciate this...If you like choppers but don't know the guy, buy this book ! If you already know him a little, save your money for another one !Laurenthttp://www.laurent-roy.com"
2,"Great photos, terrible writing","This could have been a much better book if it weren't for Nichols continual essays on how Indian Larry fits into the author's personal view of Viking mythology. After the umpteenth time reading how Indian Larry was a ""mythic hero"" confronting his self-made demons and emerging as a new person, I was ready to scream. Seriously, that thought makes up about 90% of the written content of the book. The pictures, and the brief comments from other bike builders are pretty interesting, but the maddening writing of Dave Nichols ruined this book for me."
5,Great Book,"This is a great book even if you're not into motorcycles. Indian Larry was a master at art (which happened to be motorcycles). I have read this book 3 times now, and I still love it."
3,nice pictures only,"Indian Larry has been a hero of sorts since I ""met"" him in Iron Horse years ago-when I got this book,I spent an hour just looking at the photos and reading captions.the actual reading however,was so disapointing that I would not recommend the book.the text consists of a few facts or at least items of interest surrounded by pages of referances to mythical times,kings,queens,etc-an introduction with that BS would have served it's purpose-to spread it throughout as filler is a shame.find a back issue of Iron Horse with an Indian Larry interview to learn about the man-buy this for pictures or if you want to read semi-coherant ramblings from someone who seems confused but grasping for an answer to life-"
4,they got the reunion thing right this time,"Answers the question ""how good an album can middle aged rockers make that haven't yet been spoiled by success?"". Much better than 1980's reunion disaster ""Cross Talk"". According to the liner notes, some of this record's material dates back to sessions immediately after ""Cross Talk"". If it takes 18 years to make an album this good, other artists should take note."
5,Almost forty years I waited for this....,"As a huge Rolling Stones fan in the early 60's Hungary, in 1965 heard first two Pretty Things albums (The Pretty Things, Get the Picture?). I was amazed at their energy, looks and unique sound. They quickly became my favorite as much as the Stones. I lost track of them in recent years and this CD brough back all their originality without loosing their youthful great music. Thank you Phil, Dick and the other Pretty's and thank you for the song ""Vivian Prince"" for bringing back memories of the wildest drummer in his time. This is my favorite piece on the album together with ""Play With Fire"" and ""God Give Me The Strength"". This is the greatest Pretty Things album since the 60's!!!Andras Pallavicini, Toronto, Ontario"
3,very good service,"Very good shipping, correct order . Only issue was the cracked case on the CD. Does not seem to impact the quality of the CD. Shipping as was promised. Woudl use them again without hesitation."
3,"It's Okay, but not Il Divo","They are all good singers, but somehow just didn't do it for me. I guess I am spoiled to Il Divo."
4,Ten Tenors Rate a Nine,"The best parts of their performances are when they sing together. One would expect a solo here and there, but not series of solos. Their best singing is done together. I loved this album for content, particularly their song, ""Here's to the Heroes"" which is sorely needed today."
3,Disappointing Sound,The sound level from song to song is inconsistent. Requiring frequent volume adjustment. Several songs the orchestra overshadows the voices. The songs are beautiful.
1,Avoid This Album,"I loved loved loved Up and Fredhead. Perhaps 2 of the best pure pop albums of the 1990's.But this - P U!!! The songs are trite, the music has no creativity, and the vocals use too much overlay. Even the single mix of ""I Love You But I Don't Like You"" is better than the version on this CD."
5,Great Sylvian,"This is the best Sylvian since Secrets. It's penetrating, powerful and beautiful. Even a little humor.You like Sylvian? Buy this."
4,the ink in the heart,I believe that Darkest Birds is Sylvian's finest song. This is his best work since his collaboration with Czukay. His music has always tip toed around the perimiter of inner experience. He has evoked quietude and doubt while distancing himself with poetic conceits. I love those conceits and count myself as an old school Sylvian fan. This album is outstanding. He has really moved from singing about the ink in the well to singing about the ink in the heart.
2,Snore,Without someone great (Robert Fripp) to help out on these recordings they just are really kind of boring. He comes off as kind of a Male Sade with artier touches. It's not awful but it sounds like someone that meditates a lot and only eats carrots. No Balls.
3,Could use more detail,"While I found this book to be mildly adequate, I found others to be much better. The detail that it provides is simply not sufficient."
5,TKK Rules!,"While I enjoyed the Reincarnation of Luna years ago, and the follow-up Golden Pillz: Luna Mixes, I must admit that this newly recorded, remixed Resurrection is even better! A very enjoyeable album to groove and move to!"
3,"""Back Door To Heaven"" DVD","This unique work was the last film shot (in 1939) at the Astoria studios on the east coast. The director, William K. Howard, had a very balanced and philosophical point of view in this ""making of a criminal"" film and the lead's possible redemption. The dialogue alternates between generic old-fashioned and very modern. Print quality is only average but this is the only way to see it outside of a screening and it is well worth investigating. I am now curious to see another of Howard's efforts ""Mary Burns-Fugitive""."
5,A Heartrending Story,"As an amateur historian, I like to read books about historical events that are to the point, without belaboring details, but that read ""like a novel"". Children of the Dragon opened my eyes to the Tiananmen Square incident in a big way with personal accounts of many of the Chinese who were actually there and involved in what happened, and with many photos that captured the action and emotion. This book is a must-read for complacent Americans to learn to appreciate their own democracy, and to support those who die to have one. My heart went out to China and those brave, idealistic students who tried to change it."
4,"nice toy, lots of pieces","I bought this for my one and a half year old son for christmas and also recieved one as a gift. When I put many of the letters into the holder many letters said the WRONG letter. both sets did this, as the little tabs on the bottom can get stuck. So I returned one and kept the other. My son, now 2, enjoys playing with it and singing along and counting along with the songs. I wish it came with a storage case for all the letters. We have lost many of the letters and numbers under the sofa and who knows where else. They are rather awkward to keep on the fridge. but overall a nice toy, especially like that it has an off button with high and low volume."
3,one mom's review,"I love the Leap Frog toys, but this one is a bit of a let down. Many of the letters say the incorrect letter when placed on the toy. Every now and then it will say the correct letter. I have never gotten the capital A to say the right thing-usually says its a C. The letter G says its an I most of the time. I haven't gotten to the lowercase letters yet, but I'm hoping they are correct."
4,Escondido History,Lots of great info and pictures of Escondido. A bibliography would have been useful.
5,An Excellent Treatment,"I found this to be a very useful book. The examples were relevant (and not buggy - a definite plus, and useful!). This is one book where I actually used the CD-ROM instead of throwing it into a drawer (where most of my Book/CD's end up). I purchased the first inception of this book and didn't know if getting an update would be necessary (the COM+ seemed of little additional benefit). I was glad I went ahead and got a copy. Some things have changed!Some of the chapters covered:COM/COM+ InternalsUnderstanding COM+ ObjectsCOM ServersApartments and Multithreading (a real biggy with me)Remote ActivationMTS Run-Time EnvironmentTransactionsMMQDistributed ApplicationsAlso covered are Distributed COM+ basics, interface-based programming (101), internals, and designing interfaces. Everything is wrapped up with a very good index. Definitely worth the purchase price. A must for every serious Web/n-Tier programmer."
3,Decent value,"I found the book to be pretty mundane, slightly boring rehash of the first edition. But judging from the other reviewers, it is just right for most of today's programmers."
4,Intolerance,DWG's colossal production in almost-original condition. This is a treasured masterpiece even with its flaws. The extra features of this DVD were interesting. make time for a full portion of the day for complete viewing.
5,The introduction to Xplain,"I've used semantic data modeling as independent consultant and employee over the years, and I love it. The Xplain data definition and manipulation language is just great to create consistent data models. This book is an excellent introduction to that language. In my experience Xplain diagrams are far easier to understand that ER diagrams. Handy if you come in new to a project and need to understand the database: just draw an Xplain diagram. With an Xplain diagram most of the time I can also immediately offer suggestions for improvement.Another advantage is that semantic modeling recognizes only inheritance and aggregation, so it fits well in an OO approach to software development.So if you do a lot of data modeling and data base design I suggest you get hold of a copy. Your data models will improve, guaranteed!"
4,Good basic insight in semantic modelling,"Good basic introduction in semantic modelling. Gives a basic overview of limitation in other approaches (Relation, ER, OO) Works for database experts as well as novices. Section with modelling concepts good be more explored and descriptive."
5,Wonderful book- why can't I find it anywhere?,"This book has become a part of my daily routine with my adolescent daughter. It is so simple, yet so profound, in the messages that it relays. I am grateful to have found this book to help in teaching my beautiful African-American daughter to believe in and love herself."
4,Positively delightful!,"What a great idea! These two authors are very insightful to realize that if we provide positive affirmations to children, perhaps they won't need so much self-help as adults. My 9 year old daughter enjoys the stories of African American heros included in Gingersnaps. I also love the eye-catching cover design. A nice gift to give or receive."
3,It peaked HIS interest,I got the SmartPro screwdriver for my boyfriend for Christmas. He was impressed with the extendible and flexible feature. Good stocking stuffer!
2,waste of money,"nothing like i thought it might be. alot of just reading, not enough music. Would not recommend this product. However, there were some fun songs to learn."
3,A review of How to Play Piano,A good if somewhat elementary presentation of the material. However the graphics are very helpful.
3,Not good for me!,"As a beginner, I find that I need a piano book that is multimedia in scope that is, a book that has text, graphics, and sound. This book lacks sound. I need sound. I am a beginner at the piano, I do not no all the tunes and notes in this book. The book has notes I feel I could learn if this book had sound along with the text and graphics. I also find the book is to fast for me. The book expects me to be using both hands to early, the notes, chords, tieds and tunes without the accompaniment of sound. Not good for me!"
3,You get what you pay for.,"These are good beginner clubs as they are very inexpensive. The irons and putter are very sturdy and nice. The Woods are not very forgiving in their sweetspot and the hybrid is a piece of doody. DO NOT Mis-hit with the Hibrid or the head will go further than the ball.Again, good for beginners but dont expect them to last long."
5,what do I know!??,I bought these for my husband as a surprise... we're new beginners and he received the best compliments from our golf pro on his clubs! highly recommended!
1,Clubs broke,"After only one or two uses, the heads of the clubs began breaking off from the shafts, rending themselves completely useless. I'm very disappointed as I have another set of Cougar clubs that has performed well for the past 2 years. I would not recommend buying this set of clubs."
1,Dont buy!,"I bought this set after reading the positive reviews but I must say that I am terribly disappointed. Two of iron broke (yes, broke!) while I was practicing in the range. Its completely worthless and I strongly suggest to stay away from this set."
4,Love These Types of Books!!,A must for anyone who loves word origins... I received this as a gift and my friends and I can not put it down!
3,"It's serbian, not croatian","This electronic dictionary is still better than nothing, but the vocabulary is serbian, which is definitely not croatian (there exists no such language as ""serbo-croatian"", which is a pure fiction).If you don't double-check lookups with the help of a native speaker, you might get into trouble because of that. ECTACO KNOWS ABOUT THIS ISSUE, its own website is hiding this : photos are retouched so that the words ""serbo-croatian"" do not appear, and, worse, the presentation of the product on ECTACO's site mentions ""croatian"", which is a blatant lie.ECTACO should really start thinking about making a real english<-> croatian electronic dictionary.Apart from that, the input method is interesting, but the hardware behind is really slow, which prevents a decent typing speed and causes lots of missing characters when typing."
4,Interesting,"This is a good performance of an interesting work. Hardly vintage Puccini perhaps, but there are plenty of glimpses of what is to come. A fine performance, with Julia Varady in extremely fine form."
5,sweat band featuring William 'Bootsy' Collins,"This is a very funky LP, Includes some members from The rubberband, wish it would come out on cd remastered.. If you have not heard this particular P-FUNK adventure, FIND AND LISTEN !!!!!! BEARS 365..............."
2,6 string bass,Less face more bass.... I like to hear musicians talk about influences but I can read about that...Was hoping for more insight into the 6 string bass.
4,return to form,"Yes ,the first KTP Naked album is their best but Sugarland does represent something of a late peak . They'd caught some of the dance music flavour of the times and upped sticks from native UK to record it in Texas at the behest of a fan and without a producer for the first time . Lack of synchronicity with intervening producers since Naked having been a big problem .Also on this album the vocal duties were shifted to a different member of the band George, with a smoother more earfriendly delivery that suits the material well . 'George Foreman's' a hit,the other tracks work very well too . The band learned they could become serious producers and went on to become regular chart visitors producing other acts .Recommended ."
2,It wasn't Martin>,"Actually, from my intensive reading about the subject, I believe the spy behind the Nazis down fall was Admiral Wilhelm Canaris. Head of the Abwehr (Germany's CIA), he not only hated Nazism and Hitler, but he also intentionally recruited people for his organization who felt the same way. In fact, I dont believe the British broke the Germans code (Ultra & Enigma). I believe Wilhelm gave it to them. Furthermore, Bormann was way too personally loyal to Hitler to even dream of [messing with] him. It just didn't fit his psychological makeup."
4,Lucy Ring,"This is mostly about the Lucy Ring in Switzerland with some speculation about Martin Bormann. I found it very interesting, as it linked the battles on the eastern front with Lucy reports. Very fascinating. The theory that M.B. was the source agent is difficult to fathom. M.B. would have had to be very perverse, not impossible but I would have expected a master spy to have an escape route ready. Still a fascinating read about some wonderful FEMALE spies."
2,Not particularly well written spy story,"I found that the author did little to explain Bormann's motivation for undermining the Third Reich. The explanations of the strategic issues facing Germany will shallow and weak. The section on Russia leans heavily on Manstein's and Von Mellenthin's books so I suggest anyone interested in this topic read it straight for the horses mouth. All in all an unconvincing, unsatisfying book."
5,Excellent Resource,This book is a comprehensive tool that will be useful to a variety of users. The layout of the book is easy to use and the definitions are easy to understand. It is an excellent resource for information.
5,Another great book from this wonderful series!,"This is a wonderful series of books with great messages, writing and pictures. We've loved every one that we have read. This one makes our four-year old laugh each time we read it. He loves this story, and it is a great one for summertime."
5,Pretty Birds Review,"An absolutely beautifully told, yet dark book. I'd seen an interview on morning TV with the author and, based on his first-hand experiences and his discussion of the novel, I had to go out and read it. The story is incredibly touching and poignant, while at the same time devastating. The characters are all very vivid and the strength they illustrated was amazing. However, the reaction of the rest of the world to the horrors unfolding was unconscionable and incredibly disappointing - a fact I had not fully realized until I finished this story. Highly recommended."
4,Interesting reading,I read this book as the monthly selection of a book group that I belong to. It was very interesting to me since I knew little about the war in Bosnia in the 90's. The personalization through the eyes of a teenage girl makes the conflict come alive.
4,Sad little bird!,I found this book to be interesting for what appeared to be a realistic description of the war in Sarajevo. My family comes from that ethnic region and I know the character of the people was very realistically portayed! The story does not follow a 'cliche' script so you must read to the end to find out how it ends! Thank you Scott Simon.
5,It's the new Sexplosion.,"It's been four years of waiting.....and the verdict? You decide yourself. It's ""Sexplosion"" meets ""Hit and Run Holiday"" with quite a bit of Motown funkiness thrown in for ambience. The cd plays likes a cross between a blaxploitation soundtrack & adult film score. The inside art and back art are obviously inspired from the 70's porn world.""TV Sista"" stands out for me as the top track of the album. The sexy psychedelic guitar kisses the tempting blue movie moans of Groovie Mann. It's nice to see TKK return to a more ""theme oriented"" cd that flows from track to another rather than being ""all over the place"" style wise.Thrill Kill have walked this block before and it's nice to see them back out on the streets selling their sin."
4,GREAT COMBONATION OF SWING & SEX...........,"If you r a true TKK fan?... and loved ""hit and run holiday"" and ""sexplosion"" then you will Totally DIG this!!! They brought the feel of both of those albums together for this one!!! I love it nice job AGAIN TKK!!!"
3,"Like Sexplosion, But Uncatchy","Given the amount of production that TKK put into this album,I was surprised to find that the tracks themselves just...well... kinda lay there.I've listened to this album several times through, and failedto detect any compelling hook in any track. I've loved everythingthat TKK has produced up until this one and ""Gay, Black, and Married"".As with that offering, the audio samplings which have become asignature of TKK, are drowned by the music, and the music isn'tall that catchy. Maybe it's an unavoidable effect of this recent""disco"" funk that TKK has been in. But it just doesn't havethe soul or the feel of the band I've come to love.Of course, I probably thought the same thing when Sexplosion cameout, and it's now one of my faves. I'm hoping this one will growon me, but so far it hasn't.I hope TKK gets their groove back."
2,Not for me.,"Not to be a party pooper, but I don't care one bit for this whole funky thing that KK have been doing since the Reincarnation Of Luna. My favorite albums by TKK are still Confessions Of The Knife, and Sexplosion. I'm not into this whole groovie boots, lucid funkadelic, whatever the hell. f that's your thing, than I'm shure you'll dig...but not me daddy o."
1,very little burl ives,"bought this expecting to hear burl ives because his name was on the cover. most of the songs are not burl ives. if you want burl ives, buy another of his xmas albums"
2,Propagation of Racism,"I was really disappointed with the class I had to get this book for and even more so of this work. While I admire Ms Morrisons' intellectual prowess and to an extent her philosophical colloquialism I am turned off by the pressing nature of the plight of women of color! Give us more credit than that>>>>>> If we do not end the focus and obsession of the past, we are given one life and as Ms Morrison has proved can make it into a beautiful artistic expression of ourselves regardless of race, creed, gender, or anything else.... The book was a disappointment, especially from such an amazing artist!"
3,"If You're A Drummer, Buy It","I found this book to reveal a very interesting character, with a look inside early American Jazz and the life-style of an Afro-American in the south. Baby Dodds was truly a remarkable person, and very charismatic, although I did feel his recall was skewed at times and wish we had more first hand observances on his place in drumming history."
4,the story of a common soldier of army life in the civil war,"good description of everyday life in the war period. Living conditions, food, hardships and service were well written by author."
4,Great Stories,Very interesting experiences written in a storytelling mode. Came away with a more realistic picture of what is was like for a soldier in that bloody war.
5,SO INTERESTING,THIS BOOK PUTS YOU IN THE FIELD OF THE WAR. FIRST HAND WHAT THEY WENT THRU EVERYDAY. ALMOST ANYONE WOULD LIKE THIS BOOK
4,The Story of a Common Soldier of Army Life in the Union Army,"I found this book to be fascinating. You commonly see the memoirs of the Generals and reviews of the great battles and tactics but rarely does one see how life was for the common soldier. This book is written by a judge who joined the army as an 18 year-old recruit and eventually becomes a Lieutenant. The author wrote the book using the letters that he sent home to his family as the basis. He is very modest in his description of his actions and is no way making himself out to be a hero. If you want to know what the soldiers ate, drank, how they slept, trained and fought. This is the book for you."
3,"Informative, But Difficult to Read Font","I must agree that the book is more than average in the information it provides regarding what is must have been like to be a civil war soldier. However, the type-set is horrible, almost impossible to read."
2,Personal Review of The Story of the Common Soldier,I am a history buff and enjoy reading interesting books on the American Civil War but this wasn't one of them. Very slow.
5,great product,"great product, fast delivery, I say the book given to a friend, and I thought that it was special, so I purchased the book to do the same thing"
3,A little boring in parts.,The author does well but so much mundane and repetitive description. He didn't articulate the battles well at all and even once said he would leave the carnage to the reader's imagination. Some more experienced writer would have left the feeling of 'being there' to readers.
3,interesting but disappointing,"Reading about the daily life of a civil war soldier is interesting to a point, but becomes less so while reading about the troop movements from place to place. Anecdotes about food gathering etc. are also worthy of note. There is very little description of actual combat as might be expected.Worthy of a one-time read."
2,typewritten,"I am unable to read this book. It is a type-written paperback in a barely visible font, and I gave up trying to decipher it."
2,raw.,This guy lived trough what boredom in war must be. Nothing to be rescued for this simplistic soldier's view of that war.
4,Well written,Any old soldier will like this book. Some things about a soldier's life are the same 150 years later.Eldridge
5,Humbling,"To read firsthand of an experience such as this was fantastic. Even though Leander didn't see as much action as he'd have liked, his description was pure."
4,Stunning Black and White Work,"Carter's book shows an excellent mastery of the black and white medium. He works with an amazing shallow depth of field for both portraits and landscape work. I found his images to be both haunting and alluring. I highly recommend this book, but also recommend viewing his actual prints in a gallery setting. Unfortunately, the book reproductions don't do justice to the original tonality."
3,Good but drags on,Great begging it starts right were GWTW left off.But then the story drags on throught he on again off again love affair of Scarlet and Rhett.The auther dose a good job of the emotions of the characters throught he whole book.The story is kidda fare fetched at times Scarlett moves to Ireland and finds out she's pregnet and dosent tell Rhett becouse he re-marries.After that the story drags on in pointless storylines.But overall it was a well done sequal that should enjoy all fans of the origianl.
2,Not as good,"Definitely not on the same level as Margaret Mitchell, although it is hard to right a sequel to another person's work."
1,Inadequate in every respect,"It's almost impossible to describe how disappointing ""Scarlett"" is to a serious fan of GWTW. The character becomes two-dimensional; the deep pain between Rhett and Scarlett is portrayed as a mere lovers' tiff; and worst of all, the plot inexplicably abandons the deep south setting where GWTW is so firmly rooted for a trip to Ireland, so that the last vestiges of Scarlett's original characterization can be laid aside in favor of romance-novel tropes. When the villagers decided Scarlett's new daughter was ""cursed,"" I seriously wanted to call up the Mitchell estate and ask who approved any version of this story. I understand that Ripley's other work is better, but she was just the wrong person for this sequel."
5,"Too good to be true, I don't care what you say.","I grew up on GONE WITH THE WIND thanks to my grandmother...so when I heard about this sequel, I was fascinated. Yes, the story and plot take some strange turns, but the book itself is well-written, and the character of Scarlett is captured very well, in my opinion. She was always one to make impetuous decisions, some of which even turned out bad, so to me, her choice to go to Ireland wasn't all that weird. Plus, the ending was exactly what a romantic would want :)"
1,Garbage!,"This has got to be one of the worst books I've ever read. Why in the world Alexandra Ripley, who is a mediocre author at best, was chosen to write the sequel to GWTW I have no idea. The characters were unrecognizable and the writing is pathetic. Calling this book a sequel to GWTW is an insult to Margaret Mitchell's memory. Whoever chose Ripley to write it must have been either drunk at the time or illiterate. Don't waste your money."
1,WHAT IS THE DEAL W/ THIS BOOK?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!!?!??!!?!,"I cannot even believe the publisher would try and pass this off as scarlett!?!?!?!? it is all summed up in one line, ""i am an irish lass w/ a free swinging skirt and a secret red petticoat"" WHO WAS THAT?????? that certainly wasn't scarlettt!!!!!!!!!!! what about TARA?!?!?!?!?! scarlett will always LOVE tara. to give up, NO. rhett in love w/ ann hampton? what about scarlett's daring, her fire, her drive.her lust for life? an acholoic i think not!!!!!!!! and don't think ripley just sucks w/ this book no, it extends to her other works as well. i just don't known this........."
4,You'll Hate It Or You'll Love It,"If you like books with happy endings you'll love this book, but if you loved the ending to Gone With The Wind- you'll hate it."
2,Alexandra Ripley is no Margaret Mitchell,"From the moment I first read Gone With The Wind I was hooked, and dreamed of how Scarlett and Rhett would someday be reunited. That is part of the magic of GWTW, the greatest love story of all time. I can't believe that Alexandra Ripley even read GWTW. Tara was Scarlett's heart and soul, the source of her strength, and she never would have left it, not as long as there was a breath in her body. ""Scarlett"" is an enjoyable book in itself...Ripley tells a good tale. However, she seems to have written the book as her own story, as if by moving Scarlett to Ireland can give her the freedom to change certain pesonalities with the characters, but not quite understanding the depth of them as their creator did. Treated as a seperate book, it would be more enjoyable, but not as the sequel to the greatest love story ever told"
1,Dreadful - I wish I hadn't read it,"As a 'sequel' to GWTW this book was embarrassing. Ripley seems to have little idea as to characterisation, and the main characters do not ring true to the original. And where have the supporting characters gone?In addition, as an Irish person I am both embarrassed and offended by the appalling portrait of 19th-century Ireland. Authors should write about what they know; Ripley certainly does not know Ireland.Forget this book, and remember GWTW as it is."
2,"Excited for a sequel, but disappointment is flooding","The first time I heard of a sequel to GWTW was when I saw ads about the miniseries. I was overjoyed because someone had finally decided to write a sequel. It must have been hard to follow in the footsteps of one of the greats. I could never do it. Even though I haven't finished, I'm disappointed. Ripley failed to transfer the feelings and emotions into the sequel. Tara was barely mentioned, Scarlett's pride and soul! Some things Scarlett did in the sequel were unthinkable. It rushed in places and was too slow in others. It also had too much of a 90's touch to it. The emotions that had sparked in me after reading GWTW were washed out in this book. I was disappointed, but glad to have read something that will put my mind at ease. Besides, this is only one person's hopeful attempt at recapturing the romance and emotions of this amazing classic novel. I must commend the author at having the gumption to try."
2,If you're aching to know the outcome with Scarlett and Rhett,"...the only especially attractive aspect of this book is that you'll find out in the end.Obviously, Margaret Mitchell's work would be a ""tough act to follow"" in any case, but the depth of characterisation, historical flavous, and relationships in the first book is sadly absent from the second. One who has loved Gone with the Wind will find that the few characters who have not died are shelved, and, since we came to know them so intensely and at such length in the Mitchell work, old friends seem to be total strangers.All in all, it is very disappointing. Rent it at your library."
1,Awful. Just awful.,"I was so excited to read this book. I ignored the reviews I had read about how horribly this actually followed the characters and whatnot....then, I realized it was all true. The beginning wasn't so bad. It seemed to be going well enough - until Ireland. I don't know why, but the whole thing about Scarlett travelling to Ireland did not seem like it would have happened as if it were the REAL Scarlett. The way Scarlett is depicted in this novel is sickening. I was severely disappointed with this book. Oh well."
1,Don't waste your time!,"I absolutely LOVE GWTW, and was a little skeptical of a sequel by an unknown author in the first place, but decided to read it anyway. It was horrible. It shouldn't even be associated with GWTW.The author's style of writing seems to skip along without much detail or insight into the characters, save Scarlett. I felt like the author spent most of her time trying to tie in key phrases and ideas from the main book (to the point that I was fairly annoyed by the end of it), all the while failing miserably and making it quite obvious that she couldn't have penned the original.It was a pain to read and I was thankful when I finally closed the book. I understand the author must have had big shoes to fill and a high standard to meet, but it would have been better if the book had not been written at all and we were left with our imaginations to decide Scarlett and Rhett's fate."
4,I couldn't stop being attracted to this story.,"The author Alexandra Ripley did a wonderful job writing this sequel to ""Gone with the Wind"".""Gone with the Wind"" ends with question marks. Rhett Butler has left Scarlett O'Hara --- and she determined to get him back. Can she? Will they become happy? A lot of fans wanted to know.But Alexandra Ripley was not Margaret Mitchell. Scarlett's personality was coming from Margaret's personality and life. Ms Ripley was an excellent writer but she was a completely different personality. She said to herself, ""Scarlett is not my kind of person"". So we don't have to compare these two books.At any rate, Ms Ripley did her best. She continued the story the only way it could be continued. This book has shown me the greatness of experiencing true love.Please don't pass this book up because of pre-judgments or the movie version of Scarlett. I would recommend this to anyone who loves the heroine, Scarlett O'Hara."
2,A Little Too Windy,"I was very happy to have a sequel to GWTW, but this book left much to be desired. There was such a long winded tale just to find out if Scarlett gets her man. I especially didn't like the ending it left me wanting more. There was not much development on the relationship between Scarlett and Rhett so the way their relationship ends was too sudden and abrupt. It is a very good read if you are not looking for GWTW but that is the purpose of reading this book. It may be that my expectations were too high, I was very excited after reading GWTW and was very much looking forward to finding out how it ends. I have to say I was somewhat disappointed."
1,Before you even think about giving this book 5 stars...,"...please remind yourself that there is a difference between a groundbreaking, epic historical novel and an overly lengthy Harlequin Romance. ""Gone With the Wind"" is the former; ""Scarlett"" is the latter. This book is the single most oustanding example of why some books and movies should end where they end, without a sequel."
3,Copyright 101,"First off, allow me to beg your forgiveness: this book was published in 1991, so I am coming very, very late to the party. Also, someone else may have already written what I'm about to write; I just didn't feel like slogging through 350 reviews to find out.Margaret Mitchell died, too young, in 1949, in a traffic accident. At the time, literary copyright extended to the lifetime of the author plus fifty years. Because Ms. Mitchell did in '49, that fifty-year clock began ticking then, due to expire in 1999. Her estate had to do SOMETHING to lock up the characters again, or they'd have lapsed into the public domain, and you'd have had Scarlett and Rhett pushing pizzas on TV. ""Scarlett"" is the something they came up with.At the time this book was published, copyright extended to the life of the author plus seventy-five years (it's now a stone cold CENTURY). So, if you disliked ""Scarlett,"" buck up: in the year 2066 the Stephens-Mitchell Estate will have to do it all over again."
2,.....why?,The only good thing about this book was the ending. It was a little cheesey & kind of boring. The writter just wasn't very good. The first is my favorite book & this just doesn't compare.
3,Hi...the book's not great..but it will suffice,"I just read the review by""a reader from USA""and I found his language rather strong and vaguely disturbing.Contrary to his belief,authors do not always write sequels to reap profits.In this case,I believe that this sequel has satisfied readers who are disturbed by the unfulfilled passion of Rhett and Scarlett.Yet I can be the first to admit that the sequel has not the passion and majestic grandeur of GWTW:Scarlett did not and could not depict a style that remained true to the spirit of the original,but Ripley has done the best that she could,and the reunion between Rhett,Scarlett and his new found daughter,Cat,has been mutually satisfying to fans of GWTW.I will recommend it to readers who adore GWTW but would prefer a happier ending,and I assert that though it hardly parallels GWTW in its grandeur and sweeping intensity,it hardly merits to be named as ""trash"" or ""garbage"""
2,Disappointing,"The book is romance novel trash. I suppose the only benefit was that the Mitchell Trusts got to extend their copyright on GWTW, which would have expired in 2011 if they had not consented to the writing of the sequel. Scarlett lacks the interplay of history and devotion to the traditions of the Old South that is evident thoroughout Margaret Mitchell's work.Ripley obviously spent a lot of time engaged in historical research. For example, she knew that South Carolina law did not permit divorce (a circumstance that was not changed until after World War II) and also knew that military courts sometimes granted divorces anyway during the Reconstruction Period."
2,Could have been written much better,"I expected much more from the sequel of GWTW. The difference between the authors of the two books shows up. Margaret Mitchell's GWTW was simply great, but Alexandra Ripley's Scarlett was not what I thought the ideal continuation of Scarlett's life."
4,I would read 100 sequels!,"I agree, this book pales in comparison to GWTW, but what sequel not written by Margaret Mitchell wouldn't? With that in mind I loved Scarlett. The characters of GWTW have lived on in my heart for years, and I appreciate any work that tries to revive them. Does this book do justice to them, somewhat, and that is all I ask. Many reviewers have said that if you ""really"" love GWTW you will hate this book. Not so. I relish any conversation with a rabid fan that can ruminate over what happened to Scarlett and Rhett, and reading this was like having a very satisfying conversation. I wish there were numerous sequels and I would read every single one and probably enjoy all of them. This book is a great enjoyment if you don't take it too seriously as a real continuation of GWTW, and if you like discovering another's interpretation of what happened to Scarlett and Rhett, well this is the only thing out there so enjoy it!"
4,"Certainly not ""Gone with the Wind""","Let's face it, the author presented herself with an almost impossible task. Gone with the Wind is a classic, I have read it at least a dozen times myself and nothing (in my mind at least) will ever compare to it. So, if you plan to read ""Scarlett"" with high hopes of it being the next ""Gone with the Wind"" you will indeed be disappointed.As a stand along book, it is mediocre. Some of the storyline is simply unbelievable but again, I give it the benefit of the doubt. I doo simply prefer that someone gave writing a sequel a shot rather than it not existing at all; even if it is far from perfect...adn honestly, would anything ever have been perfect? Probably not.""Gone with the Wind' is the true story that generations will continue to love, ""Scarlett"" will be much shorter lived but is still well worth the read on a cold, wet day when there is nothing else to do."
1,What?????,"I can't believe anyone would have the arrogance to think that they can take such a great novel as ""Gone with the Wind"" and write a sequel to it. The beauty of the end of ""Gone with the Wind"" is that the reader is supposed to guess what happens, not some other author. Just from hearing the title and reading the first few sentences, I knew it would be a ridiculous and cheap interpretation of one of the greatest love stories of our time. I'm still fuming with anger."
3,*Insert Catchy Title Here:,"Well, I read GWTW a couple of months ago, for fun, and I LOVED it. I read it over 5 times and I consider it the best book in the world. Well, I was doing a project, and I discovered that GWTW has a sequel! Well, I couldn't buy it, but I read a couple of pages out of the Amazon preview, and I HATED it. I know that Riley isn't Mitchell, but Riley isn't even a very good author. None of the characters act like they're in the early 1900's. They act more like people now. Scarlett is just aweful. I will have to buy it and read it anyway, though. GWTW was addicting and I spent days and days thinking what happened next and why Mitchell didn't make a sequel. But I wish that an author who could write more like Mitchell could would write the sequel. Also, the title is horrible. Gone With The Wind is a metaphor. Scarlett is just the name of the main character and it sounds so boring. I am going to write my own sequel to Gone With the Wind."
2,Romance Novel,"Margaret Mitchell's book was a masterpiece of Southern literature, weaving a story about the rise and fall of the confederacy and the hardships of reconstruction around the love story of Scarlett and Rhett. While significant legal and historical research is evident in Ms. Ripley's book, it does not approach the historical and literary heights of Gone With The Wind and is nothing more than a romance novel. Sadly, I paid $25 for the hardcover of this book when it first came out. I am disappointed to see it being sold on ... for less than $7. Not a very good book investment on my part."
3,Scarlett,"Although entertaining, Alexandra Ripley's Scarlett is too idealistic and would not at all portray the views and style of Margaret Mitchell. Ripley changes the traits of the characters, making them much more tolerable but so unreal and it feels as if you are starting on a new novel with new characters, not a continuation of Mitchell's classic. Ripley deserves credit for trying to top a masterpiece, but Scarlett cannot be compared to the utterly amazing Gone With the Wind."
3,Too long for its own good,"""Scarlett"" is a decent attempt at a sequel to GWTW, but it is too long and has parts that seem pointless, boring, and dragging. It does a good job of showing how Scarlett reunites with her O'Hara side of the family and how she becomes wiser & more loving, but it tries to get too involved in the English-Irish feud...until you're ready to scream, ""Enough already!!"" GWTW was a classic about our OWN country, the Civil War...be prepared, if you are going to read this book, that ""Scarlett"" is an IRISH story, NOT an American one!!! And as a footnote, the other reviews saying that Rhett shouldn't have married Anne Hampton is True, since if Rhett *did* still love Scarlett (as the book tries to imply) he wouldn't marry again--after all, Mitchell told us he ""wasn't a marrying man"" and never implied in GWTW that that aspect of his personality would ever change, except in Scarlett's case (his TRUE love)."
5,"Might Not Be Margaret Mitchell, but You Still Get One Good Yarn","Ok, so it's not Margaret Mitchell...we all knew that. I still loved how Scarlett's life played out. In some ways, I really like it if an author doesn't try to ape every little thing the author did, but surprises me with a great ""story"". So it wasn't the Rhett I thought I knew, I still really enjoyed stepping off into the life of Scarlett O'Hara and picturing the relationships and emotions that came from these strong ties. Go easy on it. It's still a great read if you love Gone With the Wind."
4,Don't hate me: I liked this book,"I'm going to break from convention and admit that I actually enjoyed this book. I remember watching GWTW for the first time when I was 13, and my heart sank at the last scene. I looked to my friend, who had made me watch the movie, and dumbfounded asked if that was really the end.Maybe it was because I couldn't stand thinking that Rhett and Scarlett never made it back together, and had to read the sequel for that happy ending tie up, but whatever the reason, I liked it."
2,Cheap Romance Novel or Great Work of Literature?,"Ripley is no Mitchell. Quite frankly, is not a very good author. I must say, the first portion of the book had me entertained, but it failed to capture me the way good literature does. After Scarlett moved to Savannah, it was all downhill. By the time she reached Ireland, the book read more like a cheap romance novel than a great work of literature. The scenarios, while well researched, were somehow unrealistic and laughable. Some of Scarlett's qualities do show through, but otherwise, the maturation process Scarlett suffered through in GWTW was totally lost. You are better off imagining your own conclusion to the story of Scarlett than reading this monstrosity of a sequel. It's not worth the paper it is printed on."
5,A Great Indulgence - Lots of Fun!,"I am almost embarrassed to admit that I read this book - a sequel to Gone With the Wind?! It just sounds so ridiculous on so many levels! Yet, not only did I read it, but I loved it! Scarlett is real mind candy - engrossing and terrifically fun to read. I actually read the whole thing (all 884 pages) in two days while recovering from the flu - I almost never put it down and was completely absorbed by it. Alexandra Ripley's writing may not be the absolute best, but the story is riveting, carefully planned, and filled with well-developed characters. Ripley indeed picks up where Margaret Mitchell left off, and does so with great respect for the integrity of the original story. Don't laugh - Scarlett is a fantastic story and is a must for anyone who loved Gone With the Wind."
3,Margaret Mitchell's relative's side of the story,"Yeah, I'm Margaret Mitchell's Great-Great niece at 13 years old, and I tell you, I knew after reading Auntie's book, nothing could compare, but Alexandra Ripley tried her best. She kind of lost the character of Scarlett. Her stubborn, selfish nature we all have cherished for so long was lost. Wade and Ella were given about as much part of the book as they were in the movie, none. Although I can see Scarlett going to Ireland and creating Ballyhara,I also don't believe that Scarlett would sleep with Ragland like that. Hey, we have to give her some gratification, she gave it a shot, and considering the time difference between 1936 and 2000, she did fairly well."
3,A Worthwhile Read,"I absolutely loved Gone With the Wind, but the ending left me hanging and disappointed. I was glad that there was a sequel to continue the story. I liked Margaret Mitchell's writing style better, and I think that GWTW is much better than Scarlett, but I still think the sequel is worth reading. Even though it breaks from the ideals of GWTW, at least it gives a better ending to the story of Scarlett and Rhett. If you're expecting a book that's as wonderfully written and captivating as GWTW, don't bother reading Scarlett. But if you're looking for a continuation of the story and an interesting aftermath to Rhett's abandonment of Scarlett, then I recommend you read it."
1,This book is a laugh!,"I'am sorry but I just finished ""Gone with the Wind"" a minute ago and LOVED it! I look up the sequel,read a excert and after only one page I nearly died of laughter! Is it me or is it that Mrs. Ripley wrote a list of things for Scarlett to say like ""No! No!""or ""Not Melly!"" and some more ""No! No's!"" and made a chapter or more? I would think she would go out of her way to give us some details like good ol' Margaret Mitchell did. Please lady! I've read better soup directions than this!"
4,I really liked it,"I really liked this book, Alexandra Ripley isn't as good of writer as Margrett Mitchells but I loved what she did with this book. After everyone reads Gone With The Wind they always come up with a different ending so that Scarlett and Rhett are happy and in some way everyone tries to change Scarlett and so Ripley wrote her own version of this and even though its just a book once it's written down then that seems to makes it ""real"" so Ripley just tried to answer everyone's questions about what happens next and so on. And she made it a happy ending so that everyone was satisfied and not always wondering ""what's going to happen next?"", or ""How can Scarlett get Rhett back?"" So all in all I loved this book because it just but my mind at ease knowing that everyone was happy."
4,Scarlett,I recently jst read Scarlett and I think it is pretty good even if it is obviously not as good as Gone With the Wind. The begining is good and the middle is also good sometimes but the end is great. If you want to find out what happens I highly recommened this book.
4,Not bad at all really...,"When i first heard of the book I came across it in my library. I was EXTREMELY skeptical because GWTW is my favorite book of all time and this was not written by the same author. I started it and i picks up where GWTW left off. I honestly enjoyed having an ending to the whole ""Rhett Leaves"" ending. I LOVED it. The big realization (kinda in the middle) made me EXTREMELY excited to hurry to the ending. Most people think that is automatically is horrible because it was not written by the great Margaret Mitchel,however i think that is not the case at all. If Margaret Mitchell were to write the EXACT same thing people would love it just as much. Anyway i enjoyed almost every word.:)"
5,Miss Odie,"I liked it. I loved the relationship she finally was able to develop with herself, her Cat and with Rhett."
1,Not worth the time,"It seemed the writer did not even read the first book, so many inaccuracies and she portrayed scarlett as an ignorant hillbillie. The persona that she gave her in this book made me dislike the character more and more as the book progressed (the opposite of what the original did for me) So totally disappointed."
4,Scarlett,"The first time I have read this novel was when I was 14. I remember being supposed to study for some important exams, but instead I would hide and read..and read..In 2011 it came out on Ebook, that was my chance to reconnect, 13 years later, to read Scarlett with the eyes of a 27 year old. What surprised me the most is that while reading, clear,vivid images came back to me since I first read it; they were as vivid as my own memories. I was a little sad for the years Scarlett and Rhett lost instead of being together..too many, in vain.I wish Rhett wouldn't have been so stubborn and cruel and marry Anne Hampton so soon after he divorced Scarlett. Also,the story of Colum O'Hara and his death was, I feel, unattended.Overall, this book satisfied my craving for a happy ending for these two. It couldn't have been any other way!"
2,Kind of disappointing.,"If you look at this book as just a book, it's really not that bad, but as the sequel to Gone With the Wind, it is, in a word, terrible. I think Alexandra Ripley butchered the strong sence and reality of the characters in GWTW. She gave Scarlett morals, honor, a conscience . . . things like that, which are exactly the opposite of what Scarlett's all about. I mean, when you read GWTW, you can't help but think that you want Scarlett to be a good, kind person, but when it comes right down to it, you don't like Scarlett in spite of, but because of her dishonorable ways. That's who she is. I thought ""Scarlett: The Sequel to Gone With the Wind"" was VERY disappointing. I literally gave me a headache to read it. I kept saying, ""Rhett wouldn't say that! Scarlett wouldn't do that! She's too proud! She wouldn't say that!"" Alexandra Ripley is a pretty good author, but she should never have even attempted to come close to the absolute marvel of Margaret Mitchell's increadable skill."
2,Eh.,"~*The book was just okay. I give it two stars because the ending wasn't too bad. Getting there was just frustrating. Rhett came across as really really stubborn. I wanted more focus on the love between Rhett and Scarlett, and their life together, but.. well, i won't say anything more than that. If you want that focus, then you might not like the book.. it'll frustrate you, too. It probably would have been better if the author just used totally new characters. I personally think creating your own ending would be better than reading this.*~"
1,Missing Pages,"I was not happy with this purchase. The book had the first thirty-five pages missing and then as you are reading, every page falls out. So this definitely gets a low rating."
4,From a true Windie...,"To read this book, you must first clear your head of any preconceived notions of Scarlett and Rhett from Gone With the Wind. Yes, this is a ""continuation"" of the greatest novel of all time, but a different author means a different perspective. We all had our own notions of what happened to Scarlett and Rhett after he left her sobbing on the stairs, and this is just one persons idea of how the story should end. Ms. Ripley is an excellent author, and one can tell that years and years of research on Ireland went into this novel. So, do not expect rolling plantations, fancy balls, and carriage rides, but do expect a powerful story of strength and courage mixed with the rumblings and explosions of an Irish Revolution. You cannot go into this book with doubt. Just remind yourself that this is how one person would end the story...not all of us."
3,"IT""S REALLY NOT THAT BAD",Although Ripley forms a sequel to GWTW that has a very dull plot and not very well written doesn't mean it only deserves one star! I chose to give Ripley 3 stars worth of credit for finally writting a sequel to the classic novel. She also did a good job to be sure to give it a happy ending. Margarett Mitchell would have been pleased.
4,Good for what it is,I really liked this book! If you compare this to GWTW then you might be disappointed but if you want a sequel and a finish to the story then this book is perfect!
5,Scarlett,As good if not better than Gone With the Wind. I had a lot of trouble putting the novel down. Enough said.
2,I'll Never Read Specious Sequels Again,Let me put it simply. Read GWTW. Get fanatical. Write a monster of fan fiction and manage to get it published. Voila. You have Scarlett.
2,NOT GWTW !!!!!,"This book could never amount to Gone With the Wind, and it didn't. Scarlett is not only trashy and uncuth, it is totally unrealistic. The book wouldn't be so horrible if the sex wasn't to that extent. Mitchell portrayed a brave, beautiful woman. Ripley painted a piture of a wealthy tramp."
5,The most wonderful novel ever written!It was fantastic,Scarlett was the most ejoyable novel i have ever read. This book is absolutely amazing and so well written that you will hate yourself if you put it down. You will love this novel if you are a huge fan of Gone With The Wind like myself. To the Gone with the Wind fans out there...This is a must read!
3,Scarlett,"I read this book quite a while ago, but I remember that after reading a few pages and having to say to myself that is indeed a new book, not from the original Gone With the Wind author that it was a pretty good read. I was entertained enough to get the original book and reread it. So, yes I do recommend reading Scarlett."
1,"If I could I would give ""Scarlett"" no stars!","I am very dissapointed in Ms. Ripley's horrid sequel to ""Gone With the Wind."" When I checked it out at my library I was hoping for a good read. Well, I just don't know! Perhaps I have read all of the good books already! I have lived a very long time(80 years tomorrow) and read very many horrid novels but this is certainly the worst! What has happened to the good old days when a book was worth reading?"
4,"Its Good if you think of it as a book, and not a sequel!","I have read this book more than just a few times. I was a great fan of GWTW and thought this would be great.I really do think its a good book. At first read its a little disappointing if you are intent on thinking of it as a continuation to Gone With the Wind. But if you read it as a book for its own worth it is really quite enjoyable!It would be really unreasonable to expect Ripley to write like Mitchell, so think of it as 2 separate books and allow yourself to be presently surprised!"
4,Separate yourself from GWTW and enjoy for what it is,"Of course, there's no possible way to follow Gone With the Wind and be as powerful. Despite that, I greatly enjoyed this novel. It gives me some closure to the Scarlett/Rhett saga, albeit not what Margaret Mitchell likely would have imagined. Take into account that this is not Mitchell, and just enjoy it for what it is, a well-written alternate ending to your favorite film. The movie version was even well-done, there is no comparison to GWTW, but they're not attempting to match or better the prequel, just satisfy some appetites. I think both are enjoyable. Maybe someday some other writer will live up to GWTW, but for now I'm happy with SCARLETT."
3,Not what I expected,I am not a fan of this book...the portrayal of Scarlett in this book goes against the Scarlett I came to love in the book Gone With The Wind and movie.Would I buy this book if I had it to do over?NO I would not.
3,Not as good as GWTW,"It lacks the sweep and depth of characters found in GWTW. Of course, to do credit to the characters there would need to be more back story and more depth to the motiviations of the main characters."
3,Scarlett,"I felt that this book did not live up to the way Margaret Mitchell would have wanted the story of Scarlett and Rhett to have continued. It was an entertaining story, but the characters had none of the fire and chemistry of the Scarlett and Rhett of ""Gone with the Wind."""
3,daughters still working on it. lot more in book than movie.,Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.
2,Waste of Trees,"If you read Scarlett as a sequel to GWTW there is no comparison. Scarlett is a complete waste of our trees and should be burned.I am giving the book 2 stars bc if it is read not as a sequel...it is okay. Not great, or good.Personally I don't think Scarlett would have acted that way...nor would she have ""grown into a woman"" as the book makes her do.Rhett irritates me constantly by over use of the phrase ""I'm no gentleman"" which he only uses a couple of times in the original book.Mostly I think the writer was trying to exercise her knowledge of Ireland around 1870 and her cheesy romance novel skills.The book is worth reading if you are looking for a different perspective of the characters, but definately not worth spending the money on. I would suggest if you *have* to read it, check it out from the library and save your money"
2,Some things should be left well enough alone,"I can't help by feel that it takes a certain amount of narcisstic arrogance to pen a sequel to one of the best loved novels of all time. While Alexandra Ripley obviously attempted Scarlet as a labor of love, her work comes up short. The tone and voice of the characters is somehow dishonest to the ear of this reader. Some things, as our grandmothers taught us, are better left alone."
1,Don't Give it the Time of Day,"I'm sorry, but I just couldn't even get past the second chapter of this book before I decided THE HECK WITH THIS! I really am sorry that I didn't at least give it a chance, but I couldn't! After I finished Gone With the Wind (SCARLETT's prequel), I was starving for more. But SCARLETT is such a disappointment. No one can capture Scarlett's character the way Mitchell did. There were too many obvious differences. Also, the drama in SCARLETT seemed much too forced in comparison to GWTW. And certain rules of etiquette in the South that Mitchell made clear in GWTW were completely forgotten in SCARLETT. I do apologize, but I have to suggest that no one read SCARLETT---no one who HAS read GWTW and no one who hasn't."
3,the ending was. .um. . ok. . .i guess. . .,"and that's about all i can say. Many times in ""Scarlett"" i was disapointed. Gone With the Wind is my all time favorite book, so maybe it's just me, but Scarlett really had none of the elements of the original, and left me wanting. There were the occasional good plot twists, but aside from that, it really just wasn't as good as it could be. . . at all."
2,Awful as a Sequel - Fine as a Novel on its Own,"I pre-ordered this novel when is was published in hardcover. I raced to the bookstore to pick it up as soon as the store opened. I spent the next two days reading constantly, with decreasing interest and passion. This is not Scarlett and this is not Rhett. She wouldn't leave Tara, not in a million years. This is some other woman's story, and it's not a bad one. Ms. Ripley writes well and plots even better. I have to give it a low score since it's supposed to be a sequel."
2,Scarlett is a mockery of alll Gone With the Wind was made of,"Being that Gone With the Wind is my favorite book, I was anxious to read Scarlett. I was faithful that the Stephens Mitchell trust would do a good job in selecting someone to carry on the legacy. Well, I was thoroughly disappointed. The way it deals with sex is appaling; I can't imagine Peggy Marsh writing about any ""thrusting"" Rhett was doing. The whole scene where Cat is born is absurd. It threw in a magical element that was not needed at all. Scarlett's metamorhasis is completely ridiculous. There is no way Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler would change so drastically unless she had something to gain from it. The end of the book is perhaps the worst part. Rhett showed really no indication that he would go to Ballyhara for her, yet she magically knows he's there and rushes to him. All I can say is, what was Alexandra Ripley thinking?"
1,Scarlett,"As a huge fan of Margaret Mitchell's classic book, ""Gone With the Wind"", I was eager to read her estate's follow-up to the amazing story. Upon reading Alexandra Ripley's ""Scarlett"", I was severely dissapointed! This book was horrible! Not only does Ripley not understand the characters created by Mitchell, but she makes no effort to mimic Mitchell's writing. Not only does Ripley begin the book by removing some of the book's most beloved characters, but she makes Scarlett act in a way that any reader of Mitchell's amazing novel knows she wouldn't. With out going in to detail and 'ruining' this dreadful book, I would like to conclude by saying if one wants a good sequel to ""Gone With the Wind"", read the book, also commissioned by Mitchell's estate, ""Rhett Butler's People"". I really enjoyed reading it.Basically, ""Scarlett"" was a terrible, horrible, atrocious creation. I wouldn't do it the honor of calling it a novel."
1,This book is ludicrous...,The book was good until Scarlett went to Ireland where at that point it just went down hill-the book was outrageous and far fetched-I hated it. This book is only good for kindle or as a door stopper.
2,Just OK,"Not as good as Gone with the Wind. In this book, Scarlett goes as far as Ireland to find Rhett. The story is not very believable and doesn't strike me as the sequel that Margaret Mitchell would have written. But if you are one of those die-hard fans of GWTW, you would probably enjoy this one."
2,Margaret Mitchell is rolling over in her grave,"Although I really do like Ripley's writing and her stories, this one was shameful what she did to the memory of GWTW. I have to blame this on the editors. Scarlett was not the colorful character as in GWTW in this so called sequel. Publishers and editors should know there is no sequel worthy of the original great classic."
1,"THIS ""Book"" SUCKS!!!!","I cannot believe such a hirrifying book has been published!I had to read it because I had to know what will happen to my favourite charachters of all time,i started it, read maybe a 1/3 and i just couldn't do it anymore! this Ripley woman is a disgrace, don't start something you have no idea how to do!!! Scarlett was made act so stupid at times, Rhett was so bland and boring,the writing was of a 2nd grader.if you want to know what happens in the end just save yourself some time and read the last pages, (the ending is not exciting either), yes it ends happily,they get together at the end, but come on Ripley, i could have thought of it myself!!!"
1,Totally disappointing,Unfortunately this book isn't a sequel to GWTW. Nor can I consider it a well written novel in and of itself. I realized my error in purchasing it shortly after I began reading. 3/4 of the way through the book I gave up...just couldn't finish it.
2,Weak...weak...weak,"I am very glad that Rhett and Scarlett got back together...face it, we all knew we would. Skip many chapter...read the first and the last. You will be very glad you did"
4,Civil War fiction,"I purchased the book ""Scarlett"" and it is a very well written book. I enjoyed it as well as ""Rhett Butler's People"".Scarlett (The Sequel to Gone With the Wind)Rhett Butler's People"
2,Oh My Goodness!,"I was persuaded to read Scarlett by a friend who liked it. I saw Gone With The Wind when I was a child and the movie had just been released - thought it was wonderful; but on becoming an adult through these many years, I was tempted to put this book aside (in the trash).. getting use to Scarletts' immature personality is a chalenge. I'm 1/3 of the way into the book and I still might not finish it if she doesn't grow up soon."
1,Very silly indeed,"A montage of endless tea parties, hunting and house parties and senseless self indulgence .... yawn. A very silly and pointless book."
1,Breaking Wind,"Sorry, normally I wouldn't be so harsh but this supposed ""sequel"" was/is in my opinion horrible and if you're a fan of the original don't bother."
2,Disappointing,"This book is said to be the sequel to Gone with the Wind, but it reads like an entirely different story with characters who have nothing whatsoever to do with those in Gone with the Wind. Scarlett in this book is just a shadow. All in all a very disappointing book."
1,IT WAS SOOOO BAD,"I had just finished reading ""Gone with the Wind"" and I was absolutely in love with it. Then i read ""Scarlett"" and suddenly.... Before, Scarlett O'Hara had stood for the south and how much it meant to her. Suddenly, she goes off to Ireland and hates America! And Rhett, who left her because he lost all passion he had, comes back because she keeps drawing him in or something. Thats not what should happen. And her and Rhett have another kid! And Scarlett likes it for once! Plus, she gives up her corset and fancy dresses for black peasant clothes, gives up her home in Atlanta for a shack in Ireland. It was terrible. Everything Scarlett ever stood for in gone and the whole story is changed around into a bad romance that I secretly suspect thats how Alexandra Ripley meant it to be. It did not deserve to be the sequel to the greatest book ever written. it doesnt even deserve a spot in your supermarket checkout line."
1,"Scarlett, no match to Gone With the Wind, don't bother","Alexandra Ripley is good at writing other things but Scarlett was simply totally distasteful! After I read GWTW I was crying from that romantic scene, I liked to think they got back together so I eagerly pick-up the book. I was most seriously disappointed."
2,eh,Margaret mitchell is rolling in her grave. The Idea of Margaret Mitchell coming back to life and whaling Alexandra Ripley's ass is only slightly less believable than this book. Explain to me why the most selfish sociopathic woman who everybody loves to hate suddenly becomes Mrs. Wonderful. And now Rhett is a weeny boy.It got a 2 because as a book by itself it is ok but I would reccomend if you loved GWTW then don't ruin the memory by reading this book.
2,"It's a good thing ""sequel"" doesn't mean ""equal""!","I was very disappointed, but then, it would be difficult to match the original. The book as a stand-alone is okay, but as the continuation of the Scarlett/Rhett relationship it falls flat on its face."
2,A shame.,The book would have been good if it was a continuation of another book or a book all by itself. I would have been joyous and not upset if the book was good. I do nto recommend reading it unless you are in the mood for disappointment. In no way was Ripley thinking the same way Mitchell was when writing the book
1,"Scarlet? No, it's a very pale, insipid shade of pink.","Granted that GWTW is a hard act to follow, Ms. Ripley could nevertheless have done a better job. What made Scarlett an appealing, memorable heroine was her selfishness, her bullheaded tenacity and almost complete lack of taste. What emerges from this wreck of a book is a jewel-bedecked beauty with a mysteriously attractive spell in her smoky green eyes (is this Zebra, Harlequin or Silhouette?). And Rhett, a strong vital person who was nearly always in control of himself, ""feels threatened"" by his ex-wife's advances; as if that wasn't apocalyptic enough, he marries a frail, delicate Melanie-type to spite Scarlett (the last woman I can see him marrying, for the last reason). If you liked GWTW, do not read this book. There is actually only one reason why you should read it - the miniseries was so bad that the book actually seems competent in comparison"
2,"Poorly written, but it had potential.",Alexandra Ripley's writing style is immature. Who let this amateur publish a sequel to one of the greatest love stories of all time? The story-line had potential and a better writer could have taken it somewhere. Alexandra Ripley makes Scarlett pathetic and overwhelmingly stupid and the people of Ireland take a beating as well. The climax scene is so unconnected with the rest of the book that it leaves you totally confused and unsatisfied
2,Warning: Do not read this book,"This book was sooooo obviously never supposed to be written. That is not to say that Alexandra Ripley did not do her homework, but she made the sequal to Gone With The Wind into a trashy romance novel."
2,You Can't Improve On The Original!,"Without taking time to recap this read let it just be said that you really can't improve on the original and folks really should have accepted Margaret Mitchell's thoughts that the original story ended where it ended.""Scarlet"" is really the story of Scarlett going back to Ireland and finding her families roots. Her journey is both a physical and emotional one for Scarlett. Her love is gone. Rhett has walked away just when she realizes that she loves him and wants him in her life. Scarlett decides to grow and hopefully this will bring back Rhett.Ms. Ripley is not Ms. Mitchell and her writing style is also different. This is probably a good thing as it's her own may of putting her mark on the read. This is also an unfair way to be introduced to this writer. ""Scarlett"" is a lackluster attempt at trying to finish a story that was already well and truly over. Long time fans of the original will be let down and possibly even feel cheated."
1,Nevermind the comparison,"This book is awful not just in comparison to GWTW, but stands firmly as such completely on its own. From the part near the beginning where she kicks alcoholism through sheer force of will in about 2 pages (very realistic, yes) to the horrible Breakfast-at-Tiffany's ripoff ending, it's just plain embarrassing to read."
1,"""My hand just won't write 'fiddle-dee-dee,' Ripley said","...in an interview she gave before this book was published. How in the world any publisher thought for one moment that someone who couldn't write that phrase could do justice to the sequel to GWTW, is beyond me. And Ripley doesn't. The characters are shallow pretenses of the originals, the story is more cheap paperback romance than the original and the entire effort is one, sad joke.Ripley claims she read GWTW six times (be still, my heart -- most of us fans read it more than that before we were out of college) and she outlined it, studied the language (??? she isn't even a Southerner?), and ""even"" copied 200 pages to get the feel of it. A totally unsuccessful venture, judging from the result.Don't spend money or time on this if you loved GWTW. It doesn't compare and shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath."
3,It was just okay,"I thought this book was fair - it was an easy read, but not nearly the novel that Gone With The Wind was. I couldn't really get attached to any of the characters. It's an okay read if you've nothing better to do."
1,What was the Estate thinking?,"There needs to be a zero rating and this is one book that deserves it; to even give it one star is too good for this garbage.This book is a the worst piece of trash I have ever read.I waited impatiently for this sequel only to be disappointed.This is a waste of time for everyone who reads it and a waste of trees and every other material used to make the book.If ever a book deserved to be burned, this is the one.Alexander Ripley's sequel ruined Miss Mitchell's great classic and she should have to buy back every copy from readers who were disgusted with the trash she wrote."
1,Disappointing,"I loved GWTW for its southern setting. Ms. Ripley moves the scene of much of ""Scarlett"" to Ireland. While this may be an interesting book, it strikes me as more of the garden variety bodice-ripper than a decent sequel to GWTW.Ho-hum."
3,"Ok, but not a Margaret Mitchell","Being born in Jonesboro, Ga just like Scarlett and reading the first book I couldn't wait to read the second. The beginning was good, but when she went back to Tara and Mammy died it got bad. In the first five chapters Melly is buried, Mammy dies, Rhett leaves and she leaves Ashley and Tara, the things she seemed to love the most beside Rhett. You hardly ever hear of Rhett and when you do it is about how Scarlett is afraid he will take Cat away from her. I think Ripley is a great writer and it was hard to write like Mitchell, but I thought the book was really not that great. She should have mentioned Rhett more and not ended the book right when they got back together."
3,Give it a chance...,"Living up to the class of Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind would be a Phenominal task for anyone, and unfortunately this book didn't do it. However, I for one was craving for something extra at the end of GWTW... and this gave me that something - It's worth reading even if you don't agree with the portrayal of Scarlett or Rhett... and it's 100% better than the TV series made from it anyway. Just don't expect to be blown away like you were with GWTW."
3,o.k. not as good as gone with the wind,"i thought that scarlett was not all that great. in one way it was good. i really don't think that a sequel should have been written. scarlett ended everything when she said I will think about it tommorrow, i can't think about it today. if i think about it now i will scream."
3,"This is a good story, but not a good sequel to GWTW.","I have mixed feelings about this book. It is a very good story, and well written, but does not do justice to a Gone with the Wind sequel. Ripley changes Scarlett into a completely different character. This new character does things that the original Scarlett would never do. Nevertheless, the story itself was interesting enough to keep reading, even if it is a very disapointing sequel to one of the best books ever written."
3,"""Scarlett"" I belive is not nearly as good as GWTW.",But for any one who can't belive there is a happy ending unless they read it and if a happy ending is what you are looking for I would suggest reading this book. But if you are happy with your own theory of what might have happened next don't read it because you won't like it.
4,Good book,"I've read some of the other reviews and I think it's all a matter of opinion. This was not margret mitchell and not many could top her work but nevertheless, I loved the book. It was romantic and enticing. I agree, some things didn't fit but it was still a good book."
2,"Good, but not good enough","It was an interesting story, but wasn't nearly as good as Gone With the Wind. I was mad the way Mitchell created her characters and then Ripley changed them. A sequel should follow the original book and keep the personalities of the characters the same. Also, it was much slower than the original, there were parts that didn't seem to fit into the story. I admired Scarlett in the original, because she was so strong willed, but in the sequal she was just plain mean"
1,"If you liked GWTW, don't be tempted to read this slop","I really find it hard to believe that Margaret Mitchell's family approved this author. This book doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as GWTW. This is basically a cheap romance novel, same tired plot as a thousand others. The characters do not in the least bit resemble the richly drawn characters in Mitchell's book."
3,Scarlett : The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the W,"One would think that a sequel to Gone With the Wind would be great, but that individual would be wrong. Gone With the Wind is my favorite book, so I was so excited when my mom notified me there was a sequel. I found the sequel to be a great disappointment. Although it carries on right where Gone With the Wind ends, Scarlett seems to be a COMPLETELY different character. Of course, after her experiences she would be a changed person, but I felt that Alexandra Ripley took her change to an extreme.As well as being disappointed by the character portrayal, I also felt that the ending to the book was inappropriate after how Margaret Mitchell finished. Well, I guess I shouldn't give it away, but overall I felt that this sequel ruined the emotion created in the original version."
2,Did Margaret Mitchell's classic REALLY need a sequel?,"By itself, this is quite a good book. Ms. Ripley's usage of literary elements is very good, as is her ""storytelling"" talents. However.....I still don't understand WHY Gone With the Wind HAD to have a sequel.One should understand; Margaret Mitchell based GWTW on things that happened in her own life and on her own love experiences. It's always harder to take up another writer's pen and write about his/her characters ( Take the VC Andrews Books for instance...)But....the book is an interesting read in its own right and to me, is 100 times better than the horrible miniseries where Joanne Whalley Kilmer butchers the role of Scarlett and Timothy Dalton comes just an inch short of playing a real Rhett Butler.The facts are the facts, folks: This might be a nice evening time read, but nothing's better than the original. Period."
2,Only because I love Scarlett and Rhett....,"Let me preface this review by telling you that, at first reading (at the age of 14), even I didnt quite understand how Rhett loved Scarlett. I guess that just leaves me and Scarlett as the only ones clueless to this fact. So, in reviewing 'Scarlett', I have to grudgingly admit that I enjoyed it. However, I must say that I enjoyed it as it was: completely isolated from GWTW. It was a fun, easy read, but it had absolutely nothing to do with the original. Or, you could say, it was an exact copy of the original. Replace Scarlett's longing for Ashley with her longing for Rhett. Take away the Civil War and awkardly slip in the conflict between English landlords and thier Irish tenants. Ripley's only saving grace is that Scarlett, at some point, HAD to gain some maturity, allowing Ripley to change the character. However, if you are looking for something fun to read while you are taking a break from War and Peace, by all means, enjoy!"
2,Dreadfully disappointing,"""Gone With The Wind"" is my favourite book, and like many others I bought this book because who doesn't want to know what happens with Scarlett and Rhett?I was so disappointed. Our herione spends at least three quarters of the book acting in a most un-Scarlett like manner, and Rhett seems to have lost some of his bite as well. If you love ""Gone With the Wind"", leave it there."
2,sad,"I loved GWTW as a child. I read the book over 20 times by the time I was a teenager. When I heard that a sequel was being written, I was thrilled. The thrill lasted as long as the first chapter. I was very disappointed in this book. Scarlett behaves nothing like Margaret Mitchell would write her. The only redeeming factor in this book is the descriptions of country life in England, and even those aren't great. Read Gone with the Wind again and write your own sequel. It would be much better than this one."
2,I expected better from the book,"Seriously? The movie was a better portrayal of what a sequel could, and should, have been! However, we are here to discuss a book, and not a movie. As far as books go, Ripley has a fine way of discribing area, culture and character. Consequently, the reader will find satisfaction in those areas, though be prepared, the book comes across as being somewhat predictable. My suggestion would be to check the book out at the library and save your money purchasing something else. Perhaps an audio version would be more thrilling ... who knows."
4,Scarlett,"It is a very good book and movie, but not quite as good as the original ""Gone with the Wind"". Of course, very few things are like the originals. A few have been known to be as good or better than the original. I have a few of those books and/or videos. She is just as fiesty as always, but there was something there that wasn't quite as intense as the first one. I still have it in the book and movie and I still like it very much."
4,Scarlett by Alexander Ripley,"I now enjoy scarlett better than when I did as a reader in Gone with the Wind. I was happy about the way she turned out in the end. I am a big classic reader so I really enjoyed this story! I strongly suggest that you read this book, but read Gone with the Wind first. I thought all they characters were quite charming except for Rosemary. I do not like her at all. In this book, scarlett is much more matcure and a wonderful mother. I would read this book again."
3,Scarlett,"The first book of ""Gone With The Wind, the characters were fully developed, making ""Scarlett"" more enjoyable. However, in Scarlett the story could have been more concise."
2,An Insult to Gone with the Wind,"In GWTW I was quite impressed with the interesting story line and excellent character development. Mitchell ends her masterpiece stunningly. The sequel was an insult to Scarlett's self-realization in the final chapters of GWTW. ""Scarlett"" should not be read by anyone who thoroughly enjoyed the transfomation of Scarlett in GWTW. Ripley creates another Scarlett in her novel who is not on parrellel to Mitchell's original. I was disappointed in the choppy way it was written and the desicions of Scarlett that were not true to her original character personality. If you are not a critical reader in search of perfection you will enjoy the story line and the predictable ending but GWTW fans will surely be disappointed."
1,"A Very, Very Disappointing Book!!","I'll admit, when I first read this book, I was so happy about the ending, I almost cried. I was so happy for Scarlett. This was in part because I cried for a full hour after finishing GWTW. I was heartbroken. Then I reread Scarlett. The plot was alright, but it was so impractical, I could hardly believe it! The Scarlett I knew from GWTW was not the Scarlett in the sequel. The style of writing can't compare, and neither can the plot. Scarlett was determined in this book, but she never would have done those things, like giving up Tara. I am sorry I read it."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING SEQUEL,"As I remembered correctly at the end of GWTW, Scarlett had finally come to her senses regarding Ashley and knew she didn't love him. Then in the beginning of Scarlett, she is whining about him again at Melanie's funeral? Scarlett lost her edge. The real Scarlett wouldn't have run off to Ireland. She was a true southerner and wouldn't have left HER roots--the south. i thought this book was very weak to be the sequel to GWTW. Don't even bother with it."
4,Stands on its own!,"Mrs. Ripley's work should stand on its own, not to be compared too closely with Ms. Mitchell's work. All southern women writers are compared to Margret Mitchell in some degree though. You must take this book and read it for a novel of love between two older people with a rich history. If you choose to believe it is ""Your"" characters, then you will be dissapointed. Ms. Ripley could not write with the same innocence, honor and grace that GWTW was written. She could not because she wrote it in the 1990's, not in the 1920's. This is not GWTW 2, its a good book by itself."
2,"No Margret Mitchell, but Alexandra is a respectable writer","As an AVID GWTW fan, I knew no sequel could compare- perhaps this is why Margret Mitchell herself, never wrote a sequel or published another book in her life time. While this novel cannot hold a candle to GWTW, I give Alexandra credit for taking on such a big project, and her historically accurated descriptions of a post-civil war south. Scarlett isnt the same character she was in GWTW, neither is Rhett- Scarlett's adventures to Ireland leave a bit to be desired and 1/2 the book only covers 1/6 of the time spand of the novel, the plot tends to go ON and ON and ON with no direction. When it comes to descriptive lanuage however Alexandra has it right on the money- if the characters were anyone other than Rhett or Scarlett the book may actually be very good. But then its very easy to fall short when you are trying to imitate a classic."
2,It's okay if you're looking for a romance novel...,"I really don't understand why Margaret Mitchell's estate chose Alexandra Ripley to write the sequel to Gone With the Wind. GWTW was a beautiful piece of literature, and Scarlett is a cheesy romance novel. Rhett and Scarlett are both really annoying in this book. I seriously doubt that the Rhett from GWTW would ever do or say some of things that the Rhett from Scarlett does. In short, this book is readable, but it sucks when compared to the original. There are many other authors out there that could have done a better job, but I really think that maybe GWTW should have been left alone."
1,YUCK! Painful.,"My mother told me it was a terrible book. I read it, and I agree 100 percent. Firstly, it has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with GWTW. Secondly, Rhett WOULD NOT marry another woman. Sure, he'd leave Scarlett, but only to make her sorry for whatever she did. Thirdly, every child should know her siblings. But Scarlett isolated Cat from that opportunity. The week in which I read it was painful. It could not have been more painful if someone had taken a red hot poker an applied it to my backside. Moreover, If you enjoy rewriting history and epic novels, by all means, go ahead."
3,It'll do,"If you're hoping for a book with superb writing and characterization like Mitchell's original book, then I don't recommend it. But, if you're just looking for a fairly easy read with a happier ending, then look no further. The book itself is basically fan fiction that happened to get published. After reading or watching Gone With the Wind, I always get super depressed with Rhett just leaving Scarlett. I then turn to this book to satisfy my want for a happy ending with the two main characters. After reading other reviews though, I learned of the unpublished book 'Tara' and wish that was available to read."
1,Terrible sequel,"This book was such a disappointment when I read it. The story did not hold true to anything Margaret Mitchell wrote in Gone With The Wind. The ending of Gone was meant to be left to the reader's imagination-for your own sake, leave it that way."
2,Not as good as the original,"Pleae read GWTW before reading this book. It was OK, but don't read it as a true sequel. I'm sure Ripley tried, but only Margaret Mitchell had the talent to write a true sequel. By the way, Scarlett DOES have (i.e. gave birth to) a total of THREE children in the novel GWTW. A son Wade to Charles Hamilton, a daughter Ella to Frank Kennedy, and Bonnie to Rhett Butler. It was the MOVIE version that portrayed her as only having Bonnie."
5,The second-best book I ever read - after GWTW,"I thought this book was pretty good compared to GWTW and really great compared to any other book that has ever been written. I don't think Margaret Mitchell ever meant for their to be a sequel, but if there had to be one, this is about the best anyone could write. Alexandra Ripley must've read GWTW about 50 times before writing this book. The whole thing flowed along so nicely, with everything mentioned from GWTW completely accurate. All in all, this was a pretty great book."
1,No one could top GWTW!,And Alexandra Ripley proves this point with a passion. She is the most amateur writer I could possibly think of; certainly not someone who should have even been in the running to write this novel. R.L. Stine could have done a better job. RIPLEY SUX!!!
1,Bad Fan Fic,"Ripley's commercialized ""sequel"" to the most beloved novel of all time reads like a piece of fan fiction, and not a very good one, at that. While readers of GWTW may lose sleep over the unknown--what eventually became of Rhett and Scarlett?--the open ending allows us to dream of the possibilities, good, bad, or indifferent. Their story ended where it ended, and that is how it was intended.There is no such thing as a sequel to a masterpiece."
1,Not the same characters.,I bought this book hoping for an ending to gong with the wind. the characters in this book were not really the same people and so it was disappointing. I wound up just skimming parts of it and donating it to the library book sale.rhett butler's people is a much more satisfying ending to the book although even it is a bit far fetched.
2,Booo,"BOOO! This is supposed to be a great literary work. A masterpiece. THE great American Novel! I barely made it through with my sanity intact.Scarlet really let me down as a character. I don't know why but I thought she wouldn't be such a ninny. Plus I don't mind reading a long book as long as all the pieces are taking me somewhere. This book seemed to have so much filler.Perhaps I had such high hopes for it. I really enjoyed the movie, and I never find books that are worse than movies...but in this one I did.It really makes me wonder what the requirements are for a novel to become ""GREAT"""
4,Great Variety of Bagpipe Tunes,"It was a treat to hear a Turlough Carolan tune (usually for harp) played on the Irish pipes. The liner notes describe the different ways bagpipes are used in Ireland, Brittany, Galicia, Canada and Scotland. Unfortunately it is hard to match the description with the proper song on the disk.This is 68 minutes long and even includes some singing with the bagpipe music. Most people are used to Scottish marching pipe tunes and will be surprised by the variety of styles on this CD. The piper on the cover may mislead people to expect the usual pipe and drum music.I love hearing bagpipes outdoors at a festival or event. Inside, it can be a bit overwhelming and cause your downstairs' neighbor to bang on the ceiling. Great selection of tunes.You might also try Bradley's Bagpipe Christmas."
1,Hi,"ok that was some BAD pipe music. i play the pipes myself and have heard, not to mention produced, some bad music myself, but that tops them all. i think it's illegal to play Scotland the Brave like that. i don't know WHAT they were trying to do but it sure didn't work. this cd is not very good"
5,Indy's action and adventure in WW I,"I especially love the second half of this episode in which Indy attempt to escape from a German prison camp. Great action and adventure. Part one is somewhat depressing, due to the horrors of war. I remember watching this in the aftermath of the Gulf War, with all its pro-USA-go-to-war mentality. It was a good counterbalance to such insanity."
4,"""Home"" boy (circa 1963) music!","OK, do NOT be expecting the piano/organ interplay that is the very definition of Procol Harum's music. This is, basically, a jam that was recorded right after Chris Copping joined Procol during the recording of Procol's fourth album,""Home."" And as all members were members of the early sixties group, ""The Paramounts,"" I can certainly understand their desire to sort of ""blow out the carbon."" This is GREAT, primitive rock and I can see why The Paramounts were the Rolling Stones' favorite band - and you don't get ANY more ""rock and roll"" than the Stones."
3,Perfect Beach or Pool Reading,"Emma Taylor is a single New Yorker with a lovely boyfriend, Jack. Then, his boss Claire jumps on the scene and makes Emma worry. Emma's great-aunt dies and therein starts the mission to ""earn"" the suffragette's inheritance from the her, landing Emma in a predicament spiral. She worries about her future with Jack and is bombarded with the troubles of her good friends, all of whom are love-challenged. In the end, the answer turns out to be what she wanted all along.Implausible from the start, but enjoyable nonetheless. The side stories about HUSSI were annoying, but I concede, integral to the plot. The ending rips off a certain movie starring Drew Barrymore, but I liked that movie. As one of the millions of books in the ""desperate aging girl wanting marriage at any cost without any heed given to self-fulfillment"", it is a good comical option that doesn't take itself too seriously - likely because the author is married!!"
5,GREAT READ!!,"I absolutely loved this sequel to the book ""32AA""!! Emma and the gang are hilarious!! This was worth the wait at the library to get this one!! I highly recommend this book!!!"
1,Can people please stop trying to copy Bridget Jones' Diary?,"Publishers have often told me that chick lit is designed to appeal to the 20-something crowd. WE'RE IN TROUBLE IF THIS IS THE MENTALLY OF THE 20-SOMETHING CROWD!! Shallow, Vain, Insecure. Why would someone promote this virtues for the future generation by creating a character with these qualities? Not to mention the lists are TERRIBLY ANNOYING."
5,awesome melodic progressive,"Both these albums are worth purchasing. Wounded is heavy and just damn good. I recently purchased the DVD and found that the band did Under the Sun from Time Lost- awesome song. Time Lost is a great cd full of leftover tracks. Foundations is another wonderful spine tingling tune. The ""Time Lost"" complaining about this band Pebozo when you should just be listening to this great band. Wake up ignoramous!!!!!!"
2,so..so...,well basically you are paying for the name. the fabric was thin and flimsy and you would have to definately wear into the straps before the bag would sit right. i returned it because i would rather buy a small LV purse instead.
5,Best Lube Ever,"I have to praise this by criticizing other lubricants. First off, it doesn't get sticky. That is very K-Y. It doesn't fade away. It stays wet like your mother nature provided lubricant. And a little goes a long way."
1,Needed something slippery...,"Ordered 3 of these and none of them were sealed, nor full. The lubricant had mostly leaked out of 2 of them, and 1 of them had a little over half left inside.Even with product inside, the little bottles are impossible to squeeze it out of after it's half-emptied.Don't buy these! The product itself is DECENT but get a much larger bottle of it versus getting a bunch of crappy small-volume ones like I did!"
2,shampoo,Packaging was poor. One bottle was almost completely empty inside the box so the 6 bottles I ordered really only got 5 of them. The 6th one spilled out all in the box.
3,"Good device, poor support","I purchased this item through Amazon in February 2007. It has performed reasonably well for most applications. I recently upgraded to a new computer and needed to reload the application software. I couldn't find my original disk, so I called Plustek technical support, who told me that the I would need to get a replacement disk from them. But then they said that the serial number of the device that I got through Amazon was not valid and that they would not send me a replacement disk. They would require me to purchase a new scanner from them to get the software that is required.It appears that unless you purchase this item directly from the manufacturer that the normal support processes don't apply."
2,Could be better,Had to replace my other similar scanner as this was the only one I could find to support Vista 64 bit. It does work just fine with the OS but after a few scans it develops a black line down the center of every document. Calibrating and cleaning will remove it but only for 2 or 3 scans and then it's back...customer service has been less than helpful. Hoping that someone else will come out with some 64 support and I'll be switching products again.
2,Red tastes like Soap,"These are good tough gummies, and all of the flavors are normal except for the red half of the red/white ones. All of the red parts taste strongly of soap. I've had other people try them. They said it tastes like soap and that I probably shouldn't eat them. The white sections of the red/white ones are fine too. Pineapple flavored. But wow the red. Sometimes I get a slight hint of cherry, but usually that cherry flavor isn't there or is completely overpowered. I threw out all of the red/white gummies."
2,Stale,Haribo candy is usually very good and I was very excited about receiving these centipedes. Unfortunately they were quite old and hard.
3,Not Bad But Just The Same As Gummi Worms,"When I ordered the gummi fish I also decided to order this item as well to try out, and while I found the gummi fish to be truly enjoyable the gummi centipedes while alright tasting weren't anything to shout about as they tasted just the same almost as regular gummi worms you can buy anywhere. I felt the only difference between the two was that the centipede ones had little legs and some were different colors but in all that was about it really. It's not bad or bad tasting candy but it just felt like why bother getting this when I can get the same thing with a 5lb bag of regular gummi worms at the candy store nearby....."
3,Soapy Red Color,"These are amazing with one exception. The red in the red and white centipede/worm tastes like soap. Someone else mentioned a soapy taste and it's really just from that one color. I eat the white/clear side and leave the reds. It's not a huge deal, but it worries me thinking about what happened to that red colored side..."
4,Almost Perfect!,"I got these a few weeks ago and have to Say Haribro did it again!!! Well Almost...What where they thinking adding Green Apple? just doesn't taste good at all...Granted some may like it, but my entire family and a group of friends who tried them all said the same thing...the Apple stinks...As far as all the other flavors...AWESOME!!!"
2,Taste like...,"Love gummies, but THESE taste like soap and are VERY tough. The Haribo letter shapped gummies however were VERY good!"
1,Had to just throw them out upon arrival.,"The package arrived slit open and the gummy centipedes were so hard that it would have been impossible to bite into them (not that we would, given that the package was previously opened). They might have worked for an art project (they look pretty cool), but because they were intended for being eaten at a school event, I had to just throw them out."
5,Remembering Joseph,"I enjoyed this book very much because it brought together, in one, what Joseph did and how others felt about what he did. Mark McConkie, who compiled the book, said it best on page 24. ""Joseph Smith was a man who knew how to bring people to Christ, and that was his compelling emphasis. The Book of Mormon, which the world both hated and feared, is the most Christ-centered book in print, and its message haunted and yet haunts those who profess a conviction in Christ but are more wedded to their own traditions that to the humble Nazarene."""
3,NOT HORSEHAIR,"This is not a horsehair sling its nylon!! Price should be your first clue, too good to be true.Ordered them for a gift for someone who does cowboy shooting very disapointed not horsehair."
5,This book restored me back to the King's palace/please read,"The princess within revealed to me the true identity of who I really am in Christ,once I allow God to heal all of the broken places in my life. Sister's this book encouraged me to come out of the pig's parlor, and to sit on the throne of royal priesthood, as a princess. It helped me to realize that Jesus is my Secret Keeper, and that every thing that I was ashamed of I could tell my secret keeper. I have always admired Serita Jakes for the virtuous woman that she is, and she is one of the greatest examples that we have today as a black woman, and her position in the church,community, home,and etc. She exempifies the way that God intends for us to be. So please single and married women, don't delay any longer. If you desire to be healed, and desire to be the woman, God intends for you to be please get this book A.S.A.P."
5,Restoration! The Lord is My Keeper!,"Lady Serita Ann Jakes book, ""The Princess Within"" restored my thinking; helping me to understand my position with the Lord. I actually realized attachments that I must release unto the Lord, so that I can live the life which He had already provided me. I'm His Princess!I thank you First Lady SeritaBest Regards & BlessingsVernetta"
2,SKIP IT.,"NOT A GREAT PURCHASE, BOOK RECEIVED A LOT OF HYPE BECAUSE IT IS WRITTEN BY TD JAKES WIFE, HOWEVER SHE IS NOT THAT GOOD AS A WRITER. TD HAS A WAY WITH WORDS SHE JUST BABBLES ON AND GETS A LITTLE TO PERSONAL. I AM A DEVOTE CHRISTIAN AND I WAS BOREDD OUT OF MY MIND. SKIP IT."
3,Not what we expected,"We didn't enjoy this as much as the other Vocal Point CD's. It was a live performance, and just not that good. The other discs they recorded in a studio are much better."
5,Great Resource,"This is the best market guide I have found. Even better than the Writer's Market Guide. It is filled with useful resources for writers such as literary agents, writing conferences, contests for writers, writer's groups, web resources, etc. It's definately worth the money. Updated yearly. The author is very knowledgeable. A must for any writer even if your focus of writing is not Christian writing."
2,Not a serious drum set.,Good for playing all out. They have no touch or feel. They won't make a sound if you tap them softly. The pads wear out very quickly. I wish I'd paid a few bucks more and gotten a better set.
1,JUNK,"Junk cannot even begin to describe this product! I should have known but the price was too good to pass up, so I ordered 2, to justify paying $10 for shipping. When I opened the package, the clip had come off the handles and the cup feels like a thick plastic rather than the original metal that came with the machine. Not to mention the part was clearly not made for my machine, so now I can't use it even if I wanted to. Bottom line, don't cheap out!"
2,"Beware. - ""Clamp Kit"" means 1 clamp","The picture and title for this product is a bit misleading. The detailed description for this product says it includes 1 but based on the photo that shows 2 and the title ""Clamp Kit"", I assumed 1 kit included 2 clamps. It doesn't.The clamp itself is good."
3,Centaur - In Streams falls a little short,"I was a little disappointed by this debut. The songs on this album do not flow together to create one epic, like some of HUMs classics. Since the songs kind of stand on their own, I would have thought the songwriting to be a little more prolific. No one song really stands out to me. Tracks 6 & 7 sound like they belong on Smashing Pumpkin's ""Siamese Dream"", which was groundbreaking in 1993. After reading reviews that compared this work with some of Pink Floyd's, I am not seeing the connection. Matt's voice on a couple of the songs is classic, which makes the CD worth getting if you are a big HUM fan."
4,Centaur - In Streams - Hum Light,"See my review on Hum's You'd Prefer An Astronaut - one of the all time greats. Hum is one of the all-time greats. I really like this Centaur album. It took a little longer to like it than it did Hum - not as dense, but just as melodic - actually more melodic - Hum Light. My favorite is track 4 - Strangers On 5. Try the album - just don't expect Hum. But it's still Matt Talbot, it's still melodic, it's still the feel of Hum - just toned down a little."
2,Very poor audio and video quality.,"It is a torture of watching and listening this movie. How can the audio quality be so bad? Even so I completed watching the 3 hour opera because the music is so great.The stage and costume are the top grade.I am still looking for the ideal The Marriage of Figaro DVD. I am not interested in the ""modern"" version.I have several version of The Marriage of Figaro CD. I think Janowitz, Edith Mathis, Hermann Prey and Fischer-Dieskau Karl Bohm version is the best. I heard that ""Ballad of Breeze"" Che soave zeffiretto, is the song played on the movie Shawshank Redemption."
