3,Love the product...but not the smell,"This is my first time trying Monoi oil and I absolutely loved it! I put a little bit in my hair over night worrying that it might make my thin hair too greasy. However, it didn't! My hair feel so soft today! Also, it moisturizes my skin really well, especially after shaving.My only problem with this one is the smell. I wanted something a little bit more sweet/tropical. I think the Gardenia smell is just not to my liking so I ordered the oil with vanilla bean extract today!"
2,Too strong,"The oil is wonderful, the scent is overpowering! It is my own fault for not reading the label correctly. It says ""parfum"" in the listed ingredients. I am diluting it with other oils so I can wear it without getting a headache!"
5,Great gift!,"Got this for my mother for her birthday. She bought one 6 years ago when she visited the Pacific Islands and never used it all because it was hard to get...well, not hard to get on the internet! I bought this for her birthday and she LOVED it. Now she can use up that 6 year old bottle without fear.The bottle smells really good but I believe it is like perfume, once it touches your skin the fragrance changes. So this is probably not for everyone since the oils on their skin emanate a different odor."
5,Awesome Oil!,"Love that this oil is coconut oil with added floral extract. It's so natural and refreshing.I do hate the bottle, but just add an applicator tip to control how much I want. I'm super clumsy and have knocked over the oil with no cap on, so i've learned my lesson.It's great for your skin and hair! My boyfriend loves the scent. Will be using this product for life!"
3,Just okay,"I don't love the scent, it has a chemical smell that remains and seems stronger to me than the gardenia scent. I think it was expensive for the size and I will just stick with using organic coconut oil from now on."
5,Love Fiestaware,I have Fiestaware dishes (set of 12 in all different colors) and I just purchased a set for my son. It's a great product and it's made in the USA.
2,Not for me,"This was larger than I expected - why are all spoon rests so large? But, the real issue is that the end where the handle touches the counter surface isn't flat. So, the spoon rest wobbles. I know that doesn't really affect the performance of the spoon rest, but it bugs me all the same. For the price, I expected better."
3,Not what I was looking for,"I wanted a nice shiny red spoon rest. This one is not a true red, it's kinda faded looking, & it's so shallow. I am passing it along to a family member who needs one & is not as particular as I am. It is pretty & had it been a bit deeper, I would keep it."
2,Too Pricey for Quality!,"This FIesta Spoon Rest looks like something purchased from the local swap meet or Dollar Store. The color is worn and it looks cheap, unfortunately the price and shipping fees exceeded the quality and look."
2,"A dull book about the Civil War. How ironic, odd and mysterious!","Having a passing familiarity with the standard stories of the Civil War, odd and ironic enough by themselves, I was expecting this book to deliver extreme ironies and true oddities. No such luck. This book is a tiresome litany of banalities and pointless connections that I had to force myself to read. Did you know that brother fought brother in the Civil War? Wow! Or how about that the guy who introduced Lincoln at his first inauguration? He was from Oregon - the very state whose governorship Lincoln turned down! Whoa! And on and on its goes.Sadly or my family (the book was a birthday gift) this book failed to live up to expectations. It should have been titled, ""Boring, Pointless and Uninteresting Minutia about the Civil War."" Should be put out of its misery with a minié ball to the spine."
1,Less than what I expected...,"I really love this movie. I had a copy of it for many years, unfortunately a friend borrowed it and never returned it. So, I went on to Amazon to find another copy of it. Fortunately I did find another one. I ordered the movie and received it a few days later. When I opened the package and reviewed the dvd it appeared to have many scratches on it and when I tried to watch the movie to no avail. My bluray/dvd player couldn't read the disk due to the poor condition it was in. I understand that maybe due to the reduced price that the dvd may not have been in the best condition...such as new, however, Walmart has dvds for sale for less than what I paid for this one and are in a new condition. Walmart didn't have the dvd I was looking for unfotunately, so I turned to Amazon for the product in question. I guess I should maybe have searched elsewhere...Andy"
3,A little above average thriller,"I know people hated this movie but for me, I personally related to Bruce Willis' character's issues with his mother's side of the family and the over the top performance of one Robert Pastorelli. Plus it also helps that Sarah Jessica Parker is the hottest she's ever been"
3,BEWARE! CD-R,This rating is not a reflection on the music. I just want to make potential buyers aware that Iris Music Group decided to release this on CD-R media rather than press it to the CDs.
3,:/,"great cd but i cant play it in the bluray player...only on the laptop. Oh well, at least I can listen to it"
1,Cheap is not always good...Crappy Pot...,"Receive this item in some cheappy cardboard box (Can't complain for the price I paid). Pots and pan look good at first.I was excited to try it. First time using one of the pots; the non-stick starts to peel. Sure glad they have 5 years warranty; went to their website trying to look for a number to call (NADA!!!). Website looks crappy too, it makes you fill out some personal info before they send you warranty info. Finally received the email, Sxxx; in order to get a replacement you have to ship them the pot (No prepaid shipping by Ballarini) and must send them $10(for return shipping) too.This is one of the worst thing I got. I should have listen to my wife(don't get something cheap). Oh well, lesson learnt."
2,"Good pots, bad non-stick coating","The pots are extremely well made EXCEPT for the non-stick coating. After 1 year's use, the non-stick coating has peeled all over the base. I do not abuse the pots, but only use plastic utensils as instructed. Look elsewhere as the non-stick truly doesn't stick to the pot!"
4,Good little flashlight,"Smaller and equally powerful flashlights that use ""AA"" batteries are certainly preferable to the older large and clunky models that are cumbersome to hold, use and store. After all, it is more likely than not to be used in a short term situation anyway.Good product for the money."
4,NCAA Clemson University Pet Sweater,Good quality and sizing. I only wish it had the button hole to put a leash through to a harness. The colors are vivid and really show of the Tiger spirit!
4,my bunny,My bunny loves this. Actually we didn't buy it for him the foster family we got him from said he loved it too much so they let us keep it. I'm glad i found this because now it has a big crack in it.
2,Not Funny At All,"Contrary to what the book jacket says, this book is wildly unfunny. The 'allegory' to it is simple, unoriginal. Instead of rebelious teenage humans, we have rebelious teenage aliens; aliens whose description at worst is hard to visualize, and at best just makes one cringe at how nasty they look.Just becuase the author is Frank Herbert's son does not make him his protegee. Having not read his other work, I cannot vouch for their quality, but this piece just isn't very good."
3,Its not exactly new material...,"I own all the regular Rifftrax DVDs, including the black and white version of this one.Previous to this DVD purchase, I had bought the live version of ""House on Haunted Hill"" and was pleasantly surprised to find out that over half of the riffing was brand new, and extremely funny.This live version of Reefer Madness, however, has VERY LITTLE new riffs. Probably a good 90% is word for word the same as the earlier DVD. That said, it is still funny, and you get three excellent shorts (my wife and I laughed super hard at the short about grass) so if you don't have any version of Reefer Madness, its a good time.If you DO have the earlier DVD, however, be aware that most of the movie will sound exaclty the same with the only new content being the three shorts.I didn't pay much for my copy, so I wasn't too disappointed, but had I known it'd be exactly the same jokes, I probably wouldn't have bought it at all, and just watched the shorts on hulu."
3,Stick with the original DVD,"The blu-ray colorization makes me a little ill because the film itself is already a little jumpy. The over-saturated colors makes it over the top. I also did not like how they would add the three riffer's to the side of the picture every now and then. I am watching on a 40"" Sony XBR2 from about 10 feet away.The original DVD, not the ""live"" trax, is better because the film is in black and white like it's suppose to be. And the DVD has the option to watch the film only without the rifftrax. This blu-ray release has ONLY the COLOR Restoration, AND you get interrupted by a Brady Bunch panel on the side of the video at various times, AND you cannot view the feature without the rifftrax.The blu-ray does not contain the original black and white version, AND you have to watch it with the screen changing aspect ratio every time the three riffer's show up."
4,"Same great dikes, even better handles","Since I've already recited the Code Blue end cutter and needle nose plier, I won't get into these to far but a great tool just like the others. I do wish the had the 9"" dikes with Code Blue handles but these work great, I just have big hands and prefer larger tools in general, this 8"" variety will handle most all your cutting needs as it will cut a 16d nail w/o issue"
4,Good for the price,"I bought these to fill the empty pocket in my pouch when my Greenlee's disappeared. I have found that these cutters work better than most, but the previous pair of Greenlee's did a much better job and were more comfortable to use, but cost about $15 more than these. For the price these work well."
2,"Great set, but Symphony 14 sounds a little off","Rostropovich's performance is very good, but I haven't particularly liked the 14th (my favourite!). Comparing this recording to the other two I own (Bernstein with the NY Philarmonic and Haitink with the Concertgebouw -- this last has lyrics in each poem's original language, which I like better), I found the performance sub-par. It seems the orchestra is not performing cohesively during some piano passages.Also, it is a shame (or should I say a sham) that not all the CDs are sold individually. I tried to buy the series one-by-one across 3 countries (US, Brazil and Chile), and haven't found Symphony No. 7 so far..."
3,Annoying flaw...,"I have had this earring holder for over a year now, but it will soon be heading off to the church rummage sale.I thought it looked ideal, until I realized that whenever an earring fell or was knocked off it's space on the one of the racks, that it was almost impossible to pick up again from the floor of the holder. The rows are very close together, and you basically need a tweezer to retrieve any fallen earrings -- my average-sized fingers can't even come close."
4,Nice but smaller than expected,"The quality is very good but size is smaller than expected. That may be just as well, you don't really want a huge case like this in your makeup area."
3,Good gift for the price,"For the price, it's a pretty good gift along with some earrings. Hard to fish out earrings if they fall below the racks."
5,earring case holder,"I purchased this as a gift for my friend. I own one - and she loved the case, quality - and the amount of earrings that this case holds. Its great for any decor because its clear acrylic."
5,Magellan Explorist 400,I lost the power adapter and the USB. Make sure that you order the right USB. The one shown is a XL. I mistakenly order the XL. I returned it and got the right one. The power adapter works with both models.
3,Not as interesting as the former recordings,"Their fourth full-time album is probably not their best, because the haunting vocals and the atonal guitar-work present on ""Evanescence"" are completely missing here. After the departure of band-member N.J.Bullen, Mick Harris immersed himself deeper into his nightmare-drum&bass-visions, but most of the tracks are too long to hold the listeners interest. It is also the darkest sounding record Scorn have released,and it leaves you a bit depressed."
3,Worth watching - Spoiler alert,"I will keep this brief, as the previous review sets the bar quite high. I know nothing about Eastern Europe, but I do know I thing or two about homoerotic representations in film. This plot does nothing to advance gay rights (not that it has to), as it has the same moral message as a gay Fatal Attraction (i.e. don't deviate from monogamy and heterosexuality or else). The leading actress makes a poor choice (lesbianism) and her life is turned upside down. Eventually, she abandons her degenerate lifestyle leaving a few dead bodies behind. She marries her ex-boyfriend, has a child and a beautiful house. Her past comes back to haunt her (ergo the movie) but eventually all turns out well and the happy family walks into the sunset. She will not tell her husband about her ""secret past"", because nobody ever truly knows their family. Makes sense. A good movie, if you can tolerate the sexist and homophobic message."
3,More substance than form?,"This book is VERY interesting and provocative...I kept finding myself reading bits of it aloud to friends. It also made me want to ask for comments on its material from people of all races. Though Mr. Myers provides a lot of fascinating, and enlightening, statistical information, I occasionally wondered how reliable it was....Numbers can't tell the whole story, and a given set statistics can be interpreted in many ways. I don't think that Mr. Myers is a particularly able writer. He generates a lot of hashed metaphors (""...tumbled into the abyss filled with...."" ""Abysses"" AREN'T filled, they're voids, empty spaces, gaps. That's what makes them abysses, Jim.), and sometimes writes in a cute, snappy style which is at odds with the nature of his material. However, the vast amount of interesting and valuable information makes it worth the reader's while to skim over these cosmetic defects."
1,an update to this book,fathered a child out of wedlock while giving advice to clinton how to be slick.
2,"Looks great, doesn't work well","I love the looks of this watch, and it turns heads as its got a huge face that can be easily seen from a distance, however I've had nothing but bad luck technically. The first one I bought lost obout 20 minutes a day, I sent it back and got a replacement (a very smooth process), however now 2 weeks later the number 2 has fallen off the 12, so I'm going to give up as I have to pay for shipping every time I send it back, and there seems to be some fudamental issues with the workmanship."
1,Painfully bad,"Ok, a John Woo film, starring Chow Yun Fat, about an art heist. It's all good right? Wrong. Oh, was it bad. Slapstick, some terribly contrived stunts and a cringingly bad soundtrack. We did finish it--but we still wonder why."
2,Another typical HK crook fighting plot,"Despite its action-packed storyline with romance, violence, burglary, cross-culture scenary, it just didn't deliver. I got bored 3/4 of the movie and never bothered to finish it. ""Cherry"" actually annoyed me. I only got this movie because of I'm a fan of Leslie Cheung; he served as the main eyecandy. The american version of Entrapment with Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta Jones is so much better."
3,Not worth the money,For as much as this cost I was expecting at least more pieces. I also didn't know that this is only a mini kit. Overall I'm disappointed for paying as much as I did for something so skimpy.
5,A Childhood Favorite Brought Back From the Dead!,"In 1973 I was in second grade, and this was my favorite book to check out of the library. The only problem was, it was also a lot of other kids favorite too! I was always on the waiting list for it!!! The illustrations have been in my mind for over 30 years, and several years ago I tried to purchase it, only to find it out of print. I was so excited to find it recently rereleased. I now have my own copy, and am as fascinated by it today, as I was in second grade. The pictures are awesome, and show the true stories at the dark heart of nursery rhymes!!!It's a creepy little safe scare for adults and children alike. A really great book!"
5,GREAT!!,"i wish i had had this book before my observed interviews! it really helps break things down, plus it's an enjoyable read. i definitely think this will help for the boards--interviewing!"
5,"Informative, well written and an easy read","Although a required textbook for graduate school, this book is proving to be a fun read. Highly infomative with real examples that we all can relate to in the field of Psychiatry."
4,Communicates Joy,"Native Ground is a trio comprising guitar, percussion, and didjeridoo--not your standard jazz trio by any means, but the blending of the three instruments works very well on this CD, and this is a compelling recording both musically and sonically. The notes state that the music was recorded live, with no overdubbing, and the music has a flow to it that communicates well the joy of making music."
5,"Could have been ""The Best Of Morten Harket"" this one!","A masterpiece! And no less, belongs in every home and in every cd-collection - beautiful and moving ballads, some perfect compositions (Half in love, half in hate and Spanish steps could not have been better) - I personally find the last song on the album best, the cover of Ready To Go Home - as made for the voice of Harket - the opening with Kind Of Christmas Card is quite rememberable too I think - the best I've heard from Harket since East Of The Sun... with A-ha. Highly recommended for true music lovers."
5,Other Harket albums and a new a-ha are out this year,"I have collected over the years other a-ha and Morten Harket albums including: Poetenes Evangelium (from Norway), a continuation of poetry with new music by Morten. There is also a single from an unknown Soundtrack that I've not been able to find called ""Jungle of the Leaves"". Would love to know of any other venues. Morten Harket is truly one of the finest performers, often overlooked in this country. His voice is truly magic both in English and Norwegian. The news in Norway this summer is that a-ha is regrouped and in the studio recording. Hopefully a return of a-ha will be heralded."
5,A True Classic,"Like one of the previuos reviewers, I have well over a thousand cds. This stands up as one of my top ten all time favorites because of Harket's superb voice and song writing. A truly under rated artist in the often questionable pop world, which is full of minor talents who are grossly over rated. The mass will just never know because thay are spoon fed mediocrity which rely nowadays on expensive video productions.The music on this recording stands up on it's own without visuals. A rare thing!. 'Wild Seed' is for the discerning minority who appreciate true (un-hyped)talent.I hope Morten has many more recordings to follow. Superb and highly reccomended, as are the last 3 studio recordings by A Ha."
5,This CD is Amazing!!!,"Amazing CD, Morten Harket has an amazing voice and there is some truly astounding songwriting, I have about 1000 cd's and this one is definately in my top 20."
4,his solo,"i liked this cd. I am a big fan of morten and his voice. So with out complaint, i found this cd good. It was something different, something, i think to achieve, until he went back to A-HA for the 2000 record"
1,YUCK,"A word->word coorelation between hebrew and english doesnot exist. This book doesnot help the english speaker locate the correct translation and use it propertly in a sentence. If you know hebrew, it would be usefull as a memory jog (already knowing which english word to look up). Purchase the Oxford ENGLISH-HEBREW Dictionary instead. Five stars isnot high enough to describe the Oxford ENGLISH-HEBREW Dictionary."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I have loved all of the previous Gulley books, but this one was not as good as the others, due mostly to the preaching on so-called ""bad theology"" by Phillip Gulley. He seems to be determined to ""put down"" fundamentalist Christians, but in a sort of cutesy, condescending manner, which is grating. He used a translation of a very well known scripture on the last page of the book (that I have been unable to find in any of the several translations of the Bible to which I have access) which waters down the message considerably. I am sensing a smugness in the writing which was not so evident in the last books, which is unfortunate, because what has made the other books so wonderful was the honesty and openness and non-judgementalism towards Christians."
4,Great read,Another great one by Philip Gulley. This book is so entertaining. It is so funny how the characters are so much like real church people. They are so ridiculous. This book was funny and entertaining.
3,Small Town Lite,"Nice light diversion for a summer day, this book offers up all the usual small town characters doing their almost predictable small town antics. As an author myself, of NEW PSALMS FOR NEW MOMS: A KEEPSAKE JOURNAL, I applaud any effort to explore faith in a work of fiction."
1,Signs and Wonders,Not worth the money or time to read. After reading Jan Karon' this is author is shallow and an imitation of a true novel.
5,Great product,Great Product. This is my second one. Only reason I had to get a second one after 12 years was that my puppy got the original and used it as a chew toy. It is amazing how much it holds and it comfortably fits in any pocket. Glad to have my new one.
4,Great wallet,I've owned this wallet for over five years and it was time to get another. It is a great item. Low profile. Fits cash and cards easy as well as business cards.
2,"Made in China, not Italy","I bought one of these as a gift 12 years ago and the recipient loved it and it held up all of this time. So when he wanted to replace the original, I ordered an identical one. However, it did not say this in the description, this one is made in China and the original Italy. I realize a lot of manufacturing happens in China, but this should have been made clear in the product details so the consumer knows what they are purchasing."
2,Not the best of Banana.,"If you were anxiously awaiting for the next installment of Banana, you may find LizardYoshimoto's collection of short storiesa little disappointing. Not here do we find the warmth of setting and meaning that is such of part if her work. Subject matter is at some times disturbing. Emotionally bland and cold. Not a satisfying read from an author who can do much more"
2,"Loose ""tales""","""Lizard"" is the third release by Banana Yoshimoto. It is a collection of short stories. My first impression was that these are very bizarre stories. Everybody is pretty much messed up. However, I thought that there wasn't much character development since these were only short stories. ""Lizard"" and ""A Strange Tale By The River"" were pretty good, though. Banana focused more on Buddhist type faith and spirituality more than anything else. These souls aren't lost to the darkness of nothingness... but rather... to an endless cycle of rebirth or patterns.Perhaps great story concepts, but a little untidy since left undeveloped. Even if they all come together as flashes of darkness, which I first thought, it seems a little lacking in strength to pull it all together. An interesting read, nonetheless. The language is not difficult, and it's interesting if you're not over-analyzing or looking too deeply into things."
2,These stories are so rambling they don't have a point,I found this book to be a jumble of words that were trying to tell a story. This is my first book by this author and I am not motivated to read another. This is the worst book I've read all year.
3,Hope.. there is hope,"Personally, the book is not as gripping as I would like to be.But if you're looking only for light reading, then this book is good.A collection of 7 short stories with an underlying theme of Hope. Each of the character was presented in a situation and a conflict that separates them from their dreams. They put in the struggle and in the end they realized that one step further in their struggle is worth the effort because it changed the outcome of the situation and brought them closer to the realization of their dreams.Although perhaps each of the stories in this book doesn't really stand out by itself, together they send a powerful message of Hope."
2,Too disconnected to make a strong impression,"Having read Kitchen first, I proceeded to read Lizard. I guess I enjoyed it; I did finish it and have few complaints. However, I felt that it lacked a certain fluidity of language and style. Who knows? It is difficult to say when you are dealing in translations. Whatever the case, there were a few redeeming qualities and underlying themes... Yoshimoto's skill for creating images that stand out, her ability to hint at bigger themes (although it is disappointing that she neglects to pursue them more deeply.) Such themes that she touches but does not tackle include the transitory nature of things, living a pop culture sort of life in a pop culture sort of world, loss/growing up, self-discovery, reflections on everyday events and how they eventually shape who we are, and the constraints of traditional Japanese culture and the changes within it. But Yoshimoto just touching these matters makes it seem simply... cliche."
5,Top 5 sport's movies all time,"Whether you're an Irish fan or not, this movie shows what hard work and dedication can do for a person. never quit"
1,"WARNING: Not in Spanish // Pista de audio en MEXICANO, no en Español","The movie is awesome, yet, I'm not rating the movie but the product I bought.The movie description says it has 3 audio tracks available: 2 in English, 1 in Spanish. Bought this DVD from Spain since it is IMPOSSIBLE to find this movie anywhere else and what do I find when I get it? The so called ""Spanish"" audio track is just a Mexican audio track.There's no way I can take this movie serious while hearing the actors talking with cartoon characters voices.I don't think I can ask for a refund because of this, so i just wasted 20$ buying a movie I could have bought with English tracks in my own country."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I thought the message of the movie was excellent. But hollywood has ruined a lot of good movies with filthy language. I wanted to show this to my grandchildren. When they took God's name in vain I couldn't show it to anyone, much less my grandchildren. My wife wanted me to send it back, but for the cost I'll probably throw it away."
2,"Great movie, but Amazon Video Player is not that great ;(",Wanted to see the movie for my Spanish class and assumed it would have audio and subtitle options. It was a great disappointment to find out it doesn't have any.
2,sorry to spoil the aura of brilliance of this film at Amazon,"No offense to everyone here who gave this movie 5 stars (which was indeed everyone!) but I just didn't like this film. Why you ask? Well it was superficial, obvious, and predictable. I never understood why Rudy was so determined to play at Notre Dame, didn't admire Sean Astin in the lead, am not at all into football. Not to mention I was totally bored by the ultra-deliberate pacing of it. As for originality, well, I think I can stop here."
1,Wrong format of DVD,"Recently bought a DVD of the movie Rudy for a coworker in Belgium. The DVD arrived on time, as promised. Unfortunately, even DVDs have the PAL and NTSC formats we used to have for VCRs. I thought that with all the new technology a DVD is a DVD is a DVD, but not so. Even DVDs have PAL and NTSC. Needless to say, it was a wasted purchase as it did not work in Belgium. I did read the product description but there was no mention of the format of the DVD mentioned on Amazon in the product write-up. Can the folks at Amazon please mention the DVD format in the future?"
1,Drivel!,"Woo hoo! So he wanted to play football for Notre Lame, and he waited and tried really really hard and he cried about it and he walked on to the team and he cried some more. Whoopdee freakin doo! A lot of people want to play college football really bad, but that doesn't mean we make a movie about all of them! Typical job of everyone sucking up to the Domers. Save your money and buy a copy of a movie with a plot that requires more than 6 seconds of rational thought."
1,"DVD sold to ""Invalid Region""","My reason for giving one star is - there is not a zero option!I am a keen fan of Notre Dame football and was eager to see a movie on this, such as ""Rudy"".However: as soon as I loaded the DVD it came up as ""Region Invalid"".This DVD can only be played in the US.Are you aware of this?If not - why not?If you are then why do you sell it in this market?Thank you for previous good service.Tony O'Reilly"
5,GREAT movie!!,"This movie shows what perseverence, even against the most incredible odds, can accomplish. It also restores one's faith in the goodness of mankind."
5,Probably a 4,"If I take into effect everything about the movie, I should probably give it a 4, since it is far from perfect. It gets a 5 however from my sheer enjoyment of the film. No matter how many times I see it, I still watch it every time I stumble across it. The acting is fantastic, and the story follows a rocky/karate kid formula. Though if I were to list other movies that I would recommend if you enjoy this, they would be: Hoosiers, Breaking Away, Babe, Remember the Titans, and Miracle. If you want something more than the movie, then go for the special edition, otherwise you can get just the movie itself for under $10."
5,it was inspiring,it was great i recamend it to anyone who wants to achieve what seems like an impossible goal
5,An uplifting experience.,"Whenyou are at the lowest moment of your life, this movie will pull you out of the abyss. It is one of the most heartwarming stories I've ever been told. A sure fire hit. One you shouldn't miss."
3,I've been ready for this my whole life,"This is a classic movie of an underdog going against all odds and proving many people wrong; that dreams can come true and the impossible is possible. There simply was no quit in Rudy.If there's a difference from the original DVD of ""Rudy"" and this one, I do not know. It's a great movie to buy or rent. Either way, you get to see a kid become a man with his heart, his brains, his determination, and his ability to take pain."
3,Go for your dreams.,"Rudy fades with time but this uplifting film does what it is supposed to do and that is inspire people to tackle their many dreams. Sean Astin plays the title-character who is all heart and will, he wants to play College football for Notre Dame but his grades are anything but strong. The school decides to take a chance on him and his study habits and football playing florish greatly throughout the course of the film. I like this film but not as much as I used to."
3,"[Really three-and-a-half out of four stars] Not as good as 'Miracle', but inspiring nonetheless!","Sean Astin's best to date, and maybe 'Rock'stoo! Real life story about 5'9"", 175 lb. LBRudy Ruddiger, who FINALLY gets into game @Notre Dame for two plays @ end of 5th rSrseason. How about the profanities and takingthe lord's name in vain by Dan Devine lookalike in here, at 'TD Jesus U.'?! What wasup with that outburst? Nonetheless a finebut flawed film. Lot more to the Rudy storythat didn't get told but then we are talkingabout Hollyweird! - R.A.S"
3,Wouldn't watch again...,"""Rudy"" is a film about fighting for your dreams, having confidence in yourself, and never giving up. While this is a good message, I can't say that this story is the best way to present the message. We laughed pretty hard at some of the parts, simply because they were so 1) un-real (would never happen) or 2) so expected, therefore just like what you think would happen, and really does. The main character gets a little annoying sometimes with is mentality that he will make it onto the Notre Dame football team, even though he wasn't a great player.While the message is memorable, ""Rudy"" is one of those films that you watch and think, ""Why did they spend thousands of dollars on THAT?""."
3,Great condition!,"The product that I received is in great condition however, it didn't come as quickly as I expected. Would recommend using again."
5,The Best Movie Ever,I will never forget the frist time I saw the movie. I cried for the time over a movie. I was only 13 but I understood what it was to have a dream. I am not a big ND fan but I know what it means to run out of the tunnle. Very time i fell down I watch this movie even though I cry the movie picks me up and keeps me going. I had a friend who was felling down befor her basketball tryouts and made her watch the movie and she made the team. Rudy is one the all time best if understand what it means to run out that tunle you can overcome anything. I love Rudy.
5,One of the Best,If you like football and esp. Notre Dame this is a great movie. True story and it leaves you with a good feeling inside.
5,"Heartfelt, well-done film.","I received this DVD for Christmas, and although I had previously rented it, it's still a great movie to own. Sean Astin delievers an exceptional performance as Rudy, the ""underdog"" who aspires to play football for Notre Dame. Football and non-football fans alike will enjoy this true story through it's well-acted performaces.Astin (as Rudy) portrays this young man with true emotion, and allows to viewer to really tap into the character. He is one of my favorite actors, and is in my opinion far under-rated, though he has of course moved onto bigger and better projects (The Lord of the Rings, he also directs), this is still where he shines. Ned Beatty and Charles S. Dutton deliever fine performances as well.I would recommend this film to anyone looking for a happy-ever-after story. 'Rudy' has charm, heart, and of course...football. Rent it and give it a try if you've never seen it."
4,A Great Movie!,This rudy movie was the best football movie ever! Thought When I watched it there where some bad words that where not for children. But The movie was great!
5,My new favorite movie,My favorite movie for the last 14 years has been The Fugitive. And I finally watched Rudy and I was amazed at how great this movie is and how much I could relate to Rudy. And it is just such a great movie. It is a really great movie that everyone can relate to. Its a story where dreams can come true.
5,Classic and inspiring,"Bring from the Joliet area, the movie captures the attitudes and culture of the area. Rudy is a movie that gets the whole family talking and believing in the possibilities of following a dream."
4,Solid show,Nice feel good movie. Inspirational and will not leave you with dry eyes. The story line never gets old. Good rental.
4,Inspiring,"This is an amazing movie. It has the power to move you every time you watch it. It's really about a guy who was told that couldn't his whole life and thought that he could. It goes to show, the one's who are crazy enough to dream are really crazy enough to achieve their dreams."
4,Cheer Cheer for Old Notre Dame,"Rudy will always have a special place in my heart. It was filmed during my junior year at Notre Dame, and I was honored to be amongst the many extras in the film. I've often been asked why I went to Notre Dame, and it's always hard for me to put it into words. David Anspaugh has done it for me. With Rudy, he was able to caputre the beauty of Notre Dame, from its scenery all the way down to the philosophy it teaches. Sean Astin does a good job of sharing with the world what it means to be a part of the family of the Fighting Irish. But, honestly, Rudy isn't about football nor is it about Notre Dame. I think Charles Dutton's character said it best ""In this life, you don't have to prove nothin' to nobody but yourself."""
5,My favorite movie of altime,This is the best movie in the world It tells you that you can do anything you put your mind to it.My favorite part is when he helps that guy.Then he starts yelling on the stool. at the end it makes me cry because it is so tuching.
5,A movie to lift your spirits,"I am a 30 year old man and cannot watch this movie without crying. It is simply that uplifting. When you consider how easily some of us coast through our existence, never being put to the test in life, Rudy shows us what can be accomplished in life if we have hope and a big heart."
2,Shipping absolutely sucked,Shipping was absolutely terrible.. It took FOREVER! And when I opened the thing the DVD wasn't secure in the case! It was just flopping around!! Haven't watched it yet but so far I'm not impressed
5,Dreams of a Notre-Dame Boy,"Its a terrific movie for those people that want something and how hard they have to work for it when others say that they can't do it. A person has dreams and does whatever he can to make those come true. It may mean losing a girlfriend to having your parents not talk to you, so if there is something out there that you want in life or some school team that you want to be a star at, remember dreams can came true!!"
3,Defying odds,"This sports' story proves that anything is possible. This movie might not be the best sports movie ever made, but it's a fun family story. Rudy has wanted to play for Notre Dame his entire life, and always been told it's not possible. He defies the odds and follows his dream."
4,"""I'm Going To South Bend"" ~ Dedication, Perserverance And The Power Of A Dream","Released in '93 the film `Rudy' is without question one of the most loved sports films of all-time. Based on the true story of Rudy Ruettiger and his vision quest to play football for the Fighting Irish at the University of Notre Dame, it's a story that Sean Astin was born to bring alive on film. He's absolutely perfect as the not so talented athlete with an unquenchable spirit that will not be denied.This movie certainly knows how to push all the right emotional buttons just when needed and the superb production values and soundtrack create a wonderfully inspiring and nostalgic atmosphere that will pull on the heartstrings of even the most cynical amongst us. If you're a sports fan or not you'll certainly enjoy Sean Astin's magnificent performance.My Rating: -4 1/2 Stars-."
5,A Story for the Ages,"What a great movie. In movies today there are not to many wholesome family shows. This movie breaks the mold. It displays all the qualities i would want my child to learn. Qualities like endurance, self esteem, passion for the future and to never deture from your dreams. I would like to hear from any redblooded american who did not like Rudy!"
1,Ehh... not so great,"This is a book of questions like ""Think back to how your grandparents lived. What were the advantages of their livestyle over your lifestyle?"" I found the questions and the book somewhat useless."
1,poor representation!,"I was grateful when i found out someone had made a documentary to salute Wetlands, but soon disappointed when i realized all he credited were rock bands. I spent many great years at Wetlands seeing tons of punk & hardcore shows, often featuring bands from the U.K. Many New Yorkers remember Wetlands for being a great place for those shows, and for it to be barely acknowledged in a tribute film is shameful."
4,TOO CUTE!!,"THESE SHOES ARE GORGEOUS...I HAVE THE BROWN MULTI...AND THEY CUTER THAN I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE, AND CUTE ON THE FEET AS WELL. THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE, I THOUGHT THEY WOULDN'T BE BUT THEY ARE...SO MANY COMPLIMENTS ITS CRAZY!!..:-)"
4,homework,The quality of the leather case is fine. But Sony seemed to have forgotten to provide SPACE for the EXTRA BATTERY that we are now carrying. Looks like they did not do their homework.
4,Camera case,"I ordered this product for my Sony Cybershot 10.1 megapixel camera. I wanted a spare battery- and a case to protect the camera. It's a great case that has a loop on the back to be threaded onto a belt. I give this four stars because the only thing this case holds is the camera, and well, I don't wear a belt. It would be nice if this product had a strap or some other means by which to carry it. I get nervous putting it into a bag because I'm afraid of losing it. But if you've got a safe way of carrying this camera in its case- this one does its job."
4,It's a bit advanced,"I used it after practicing with more basic material, and found it to be quite useful, especially when it came to the more unusual--and thus more difficult--problems. Most of the problems are a bit on the tough side, so don't buy this book if you're just starting your review.I tried Kaplan's SAT 1600 and found it to be on a somewhat lower level than this book. It might be a good idea to start with Kaplan, and then go with Brainiacs."
1,Don't be a brainiac!,"This text was so convoluted that even a ""Brainiac"" would have gotten lost in all the useless tips. Alot of typos, vaguely worded questions, and simple material litter the text making it difficult to undestand what the author, or publisher, had in mind when they released this scatterbox onto the public. I wouldn't be suprised to hear a testimonial of how a testaker's score went down after reading this triumph into study aid debauchery. Don't get taken by this half-hearted attempt to cash in on student's anxieties. Get Kaplan's 1600 instead."
3,"AYE, well almost","This is a quick little book to read. It does encompass a feel for the Scots character with some mild humor. The points of national pride, music and so forth are pretty much on target. Even though the book has been updated it still is a bit behind the times on some of the topics. If you want to know the difference between the Scots and the English this will give a bit of information that explains it."
3,"Good book, worth reading","This guide made some interesting points, such as the idea Scots like being noted for both fiery tempers and dour dispositions. I would gladly read the author's book of Scottish insults, since those were some of the best things about the book."
1,A Bore,"Poorly written and tedious, although if I was 22 again I might have found it riveting. At age 65, it was discarded."
5,suffocative and divine !,"This book is intense. Its intensity will put you under a spell for a while, but it will expire eventually. Your mind will change. The freedom of believeing you are more trapped than before will start to seize your thoughts, then life's gonna burst in your face like a hurricane of wind ending in the landing of a reflective butterfly in the palm of your hand. Sometimes the act of living its just that simple. The uncounsciousness explored, tamed, madness can stay inside."
2,Read something else,"If you really wanna read Cioran, start with something like ""Exercises fo Admiration"", ""Treatise on Decomposation"" or ""Admirations and Anathemas"". ""On the Heights od Despair"" is a too young and too pesimist Cioran. It is a half-Cioran."
2,juvenilia,"Utterly crazy to give this Cioran-lite five star reviews.This book is valuable inasmuch as it allows us to see the mind that wrote The Temptation To Exist and The Trouble With Being Born assemble its materials and sharpen its turn of phrase, but that's it. These books might conceivable change the way you think about everything. If this book has that effect, I'd say you were terribly impressionable..."
3,Just Not Enough,"The few moves that she shows are repeated enough to really get them down, but the music is very repetitive and gets annoying. The DVD needs 1) More combos!!!! (The ALI DVD I bought has about 14 interesting combos in it and sets a heck of a standard) and 2)Better music selection.Also, the performance segment didn't show any of the moves she taught and had quite a few that I would love to have learned instead. It's frustrating to see a performance that has completely different moves- it makes you feel as though you are far, far from performing, even in casual settings.I do think the moves she showed were easyily broken down, but for the cost, it wasn't what it should have been."
5,Beautiful...definitely a masterpiece,"I bought this CD a while ago, but I still listen to it frequently. The singing is impeccable. They sing beautifully in the Baroque style, the voices in the unison chants blend like they are one, and the contertenors are angelic. One thing that I especially like is the fact that they do an entire Matins service, and that is actually cohesive. One can clearly picture this being sung at a Matins service two centuries ago. Overall, this is truly a moving musical experience."
4,A quite good CD,"A quite CD but surely not as good as black and child.It would have been better if sizzla didn't use so much ""digital"" riddim ( a bad habit of modern reggae in my opinion )."
5,The Davinci Method,"This is a great book to help adults and parents of children who have been diagnosed with ADD or ADHD, realise their true potential and channel their energy in a positive way using the gift they have, which is often described by the medical profession as a disorder!"
5,Identity theft?,"That's what it felt like as I read Garrett's book...it felt like somebody had stolen my identity, my life story, and published it in a book. Talk about hitting the nail on the head!If you've ever been told you're ADD/ADHD, you NEED this book. There's no other way around it. If you don't have this book, you're going to struggle and you're going to flounder, because society just doesn't understand us. They don't understand why we are the way we are and why we do the things we do.Pick this book up today and read it. Most likely in one setting. That's what I did!Stephen"
2,Where's the Method?,"I was quite disappointed with this book. While it undoubtedly helps some to feel better about themselves, that is not what I was after. The hype I read suggested that the book would enable ADD personalities like mine to somehow channel our behavior into something more creative. There is NO method here."
1,"Complete drivel, don't waste your money","Pseudoscientific trash, plain and simple. This book is obviously nothing more than a cash grab. Horribly written and edited. Contains a lot of completely misleading and false information. Don't waste your time or your money."
1,Dreaded H02 error after two years,"Last this weekend, I also encountered the dreaded H02 error. Until that occurred, this player worked great. This is the third DVD player to go out on me. I had two RCA players die within a year of each other, and I thought I was finally replacing them with something reliable. Given how inexpensive these players have become, it would cost the same or more to get it fixed than to just replace it. I just purchased a Sony. Let's hope for the best."
1,Panasonic dvd players in general are not worth the effort,"I have had this for a couple of years. It went dead after the first year. I held on to it for sentimental reasons. I replaced it with a panasonic, s 25, it died after a years worth of use. That is it, if it isn't sony or magnavox, I will not be purchasing it. I have wasted over 300 dollars on these two dvd players. That is a 150 dollar a year fee to watch my dvds. If my new magnavox goes bad, then I will heading back to VHS!This DVD player played great, but then it just went dreadful over night. I tried cleaning it with one of those cleaning discs, but this player won't even read it. It gives me an h05 or h03 error; I can't tell the difference. I will learn to start doing more research and read more reviews before I keep throwing money down the drain."
1,I'd give it 0 stars if that was an option.,"We've had this dvd player for about 2 years. For the past year, it took five minutes for it to read the disk, it would skip my dvds. I havent used it since, until last night when I decided to give it a try. Now, it won't read the disks at all. It starts to, then starts over again, until it says ""HO2"", then ""STOP"".It's a piece of crap and I'm pissed off."
1,Warning,"I used this Panasonic RV26 DVD Player happily for less than a year until one day it just stopped playing anything. It just tries to read until an ""H02"" error is indicated. I called Panasonic, who wouldn't tell me what the code meant, but referred me to a service center for Warranty service. The service center told me it would cost me $79.50 to fix it because it is still under parts warranty, but not labor.Gee, or I could buy a NEW (not Panasonic) DVD player!I did a quick search and found that this is a recurring problem (see other Amazon.com review, same product.) which prompts me to second the motion for a product recall."
5,Panasonic unit has excellent picture and audio,"I have had this unit for almost 2 years and it has been 100 % reliable. The picture quality on component output to my 36"" RCA HDTV is superb. Audio performance is excellent. I play dvd's and cd's and they sound crystal clear through my Yamaha Rx-V2090 receiver and B&W DM6 monitor loudspeakers. I have not noticed any pixelization or strange color effects that are visible on other units. I am a trained service technician for a leading retailer. I have also worked for RCA in product development and for many years in the UK with the higher resolution PAL system know what good performance is. Seems some users have sour grapes because of the 90-labor warranty. At this price point what do they expect? Consider an extended warranty. Panasonic have one of the largest ranges of dvd players on the market. When this one dies I will be buying a more upmarket model."
1,Stay away from the RV26 and Panasonic products,"I purchased the RV26 DVD player about two months ago and used it about ten times. Then all of a sudden, I received an H02 error code and the unit would not leave this mode even after resetting it with Panasonic's special technical support codes. Panasonic informed me that I would have to send in the unit and there would be a minimum charge just to look at it. The unit sells for less so that is ridiculous.After seeing all the people with the same error, I don't understand why they don't have a recall on this product.Therefore I purchased another manufacturer's DVD player and will never purchase another Panasonic product."
5,Thanks Dr. V!,"I recently started weightlifing as my primary sport. In the past, I had only strength trained as part of a conditioning regimen for other sports (basketball, rowing, volleyball). At age 35, I decided to start working out again, with the focus on my shape and muscle size and tone. Of all the books I looked at to start my workout regime with, I chose this one. Dr. Vedral covers all of the angles -- diet, motivation, what exercises to do, how to do them (with pictures!), how to do them at home or at the gym, how often to do them, and when to fit in your cardio workouts. It is clear that she knows her stuff, and from her photos, it works. I also have Dr. Vedral's 12-minute workout, which I had pretty good results with. My goal - to look as good as Dr. Vedral! (I have a ways to go....)"
1,These taste terrible! The texture is dry and ...,These taste terrible! The texture is dry and chalky. You would think for a bar that dry it would contain more protein. Other bars containing the same supplements taste better and have a smoother texture. I would not recommend this product to my friends or family because there are better protein bars that are much tastier and not so dry.
2,"Forced subscription purchase... cancel, cancel, no response.","This is a great product. However, the subscription process on Amazon leaves some to be desired.I love the concept and am trying it once again even after saying ""Never again"" over trying toget the subscription for this product cancelled. ... for months... and then getting a forcedpurchase - delivery that I found out about by seeing the charge show up in my online bankstatement and a few days later on my door step. Automated shopping is supposed to be EASIER.Having to repeatedly address this sort of snafu is what sends many shoppers back to thebricks/mortar stores."
2,These didn't really taste the way I expected ...,"These didn't really taste the way I expected and I didn't care for them. I like peanut butter and chocolate chips, but I just didn't like them together. My son and husband both loved them, so I guess it's your preference. Maybe I will try a different flavor because I need all the energy I can get."
1,Extra USD 15 need to pay upon goods arrival,"Why there was USD 15 postage shortfall that needed to pay upon arrival on the items I purchased at the same time, which was not notified when PO placed? Felt like a cheating game and will have to accept by paying the extra USD 15."
3,Where's my gift certificate,"Bought these as part of a ""buy two boxes, get a $10 gift certificate"" deal. Bought it in April, still haven't received the gift cert.Anyways, back to the bars. They're ok. Not my first (or second) choices, but they were part of the promotion and since I eat power bars all the time anyways, I just bought them. I'd get a tastier flavor if they were available."
4,Very good bars - good substitute for strawberry bars,"I prefer the strawberry bars, but Amazon stopped selling them at the time I was buying. I tried these and was very happy with the taste. They didn't have any aftertaste that some power bars have. Very good overall."
2,I wouldn't recommend this product to a friend ...,"I wouldn't recommend this product to a friend because it really doesn't taste that good. The bars were edible, but I had to force myself to eat it. I didn't feel energized after eating it, even though it's supposed to be an energy bar. I wouldn't purchase this product."
4,best breakfast bar,"This is the best breakfast bar I've found. The flavor is delicious and it is filling. The only thing that could be improved is to lower the calory count a little (250); but if they did that, I guess it might not taste as good or keep you full. Ordering from this source is a good choice, too, as the bars were very fresh. (I ordered them from another source once & they were extremely stale but cost just as much.)"
4,Delicious Flave,"MMMMMM...ordered these after the peanut butter flavor ran out. They are great! Love 'em. Keep em in my desk at work so that when that 3 o'clock crash/hunger-go-get-Cheeto's-or-some=other-unhealthy-nonsense from the vending machine craving hits, I just eat one of these. They even have vitamins and minerals in 'em, 40% of calcium daily value! SOLD"
4,This product was well worth what I would've ...,"This product was well worth what I would've paid for it. They were fresh, delicious and just plain great. I believe I would recommend this item to people I know. I was very impressed with the taste of it. Most of these products taste like they have been packaged for MONTHS! And most of these types of products also have a straw taste, kind of dry and """"blah"""". But these were fresh and quite tasty with lots of chocolate and peanut butter. My suggestion is """"try it, you'll like it""""."
3,I ate one of these bars each morning ...,"I ate one of these bars each morning for a week. The taste of this product was good, but the texture was kind of a 'gooey' consistency as opposed to the 'moist' claim made by the company. Personally, I wouldn't buy this product again, although I did have more energy when I used this product -- I didn't feel as sluggish in the afternoon."
5,Box opened and missing bars!,"I love the product itself BUT when it got here the Powerbar box had been opened and there was 3 bars missing. Obviously not impressed with that, I try to only buy from Amazon themselves to avoid this kind of crap."
3,very high in calories,"I have found this bar to be a great alternative to many of the HIGH FAT and HIGH calories so called ""health"" bars that are out there. As is commonly known many of the bars are just protein packed Snickers bars... very high in fat, very high in calories."
4,Great tasting!,I gave them 4 stars because there is too much sugar. I got a coupon to buy 2 bars and get one free. I am glad I tried them. I just found them on here and it is cheaper than my local grocery store and the shipping is free. I used them as meal replacement. I am one of those people who hate to eat breakfast or eat when I first get up.
5,harvesty delight,This is my favorite flavor. It's chewy (not dry) and pretty filling. A good lunch substitute on really busy work days... or a great snack for a normal person. :)
4,Good product but why has the price doubled?,Last few times I ordered these they were $14.59 a box (15 bars).Now the price is $35.05 a box (still 15 bars)?!?I can (and will) buy them locally for that.
5,Love the Crunch,I have had other energy bars and all that I have found have been chewy. This one I picked up on a 50 mile ride from a local bike shop - and the crunch was great. The taste is very chocolatey - which is not a problem since I like chocolate.
2,Amazon sent me old bars,"these are absolutely delicious, but I ordered this item and the one i got was this item but it was the old wrapper and the expiration date was only like five months away. I mean I didn't mind so much that the wrapper was old, but the fact that the bars themselves were actually old. Usually when I buy these bars in the local drugstore, they don't expire for a least another year or more."
2,Imax horese,Good but it needed more about the horses. The movie needed to explain more about each horse and why that horse went to that particular way in its training and follow each horse more through its training.
2,The reality is cruel,"Instead of this fairybook story, I strongly suggest people seeSAVING AMERICA'S HORSES A NATION BETRAYED is an feature documentary film which explains how horses are treated in America.For more info go to:Must the mustangs and racehorses end up as European meat?[...][...]"
4,Beautifully Filmed!,This is a great story and beautifully filmed the whole way through. This is a fun movie to share with friends. I watched it at home first and then watched it with a friend who's a fellow horse lover. I also let my riding instructer borrow it and she took it to a horse show and set up a little outdoor theater with this playing. The kids loved it!
2,"Cute, but flimsy.",I bought this because is was adorable. The wiring inside is very thin and it broke when we opened it :(
2,"Cute, but doesn't stand up to a 2-year-old","These umbrellas are really cute and both my boys (2 and 5) love them. However, after only 5 minutes of running around with it, my 2-year-old dropped it and stepped on a couple of the tension rods and they broke. So now, it doesn't stay open. The tension rods are quite flimsy, so I'd recommend this for older (5+) children who can understand it's only for keeping rain off their heads."
4,Well done!,"I have enjoyed reading the book. It seems to be very well written, lots of good information. Now I just need to start practicing what I've learned."
5,"Inspiring, helpful, highly recommended.","In lieu of a long list of superlatives let me just say that a few years ago this book inspired me to go out and sketch in the wilderness and I have been doing it ever since. I have read several books on how to sketch, draw and paint, but no one I know does such a magnificent job of describing and explaining the subject. From materials to technique, to the thought process that goes into sketching in the field, Cathy Johnson covers it all concisely, rationally and with feeling.I recommend this book for beginner or otherwise. Twelve chapters. It has 227 pages and no index. Good bibliography."
5,Best book on the subject,"I have read every book that I could find on windows and doors and found this one to be the best bar none. The pictures are fantastic and the helpful tips are worth the price of the book and then some. Also, the book is very easy to understand which is not the case with a lot of books out there on the subject."
4,Old windows,I have a 100 + years old house with the original windows. They have a section on Tuning Up Old Windows which I found very helpful. There are only a few pages on this subject for old windows. The information is straight forward and to the point.
3,Install Like a Pro,"Good book, but title is misleading, more about proper installation of windows & doors rather than fabrication of doors & windows. Title should be ""Install Like a Pro"""
3,Good General Resource,"Pretty general information and suggestions on interior and exterior doors, windows and skylights. Plenty of illustrations, tips, ""trade secrets"" and ""what could go wrong"" tidbits. There is enough information here to get the DIY'er in some trouble - not enough detail to really be able to DIY it, but enough to think so. Good general information, but I would not solely rely on this book as a ""how to""."
3,Lots of good information -- just not the information I was looking for,I have 15 neglected 80-year-old duplex pulley windows. Not a word about this type in this book.Much good stuff if I were doing other projects; maybe I'll come back to this later.
1,Not what I expected,"I was a little disappointed that the book didn't get into ""Sizing"" the windows more than it did. I have an all brich home made in 1957 and the book didn't touch base on any aspects of installation for homes like mine. I will now look for a book that does."
1,not much good,"I had high hopes for this to provide some useful information, that didn't happen. This book provides no real value. In is just generalized info and very little of that. I would purchase the Black n Decker books, they are 500 times better."
1,Buid it like a Por windows and doors.,Great book only if you want to makes openings and order new doors and windows.
4,fun read,"I usually don't read much of historical literature, however this was a treat. I love a good story and this is exactly what you get. It is a bit long at times, however it's still a great read in my eyes."
4,Good freebie,"Keep in mind that this is a free Kindle version of a book from 1887. The views are of someone from quite a while back. Also no illustrations.James Johonnot has picked 10 great events in history to discuss in 2,728 locations.Greeks vs. PersiansCrusadesSwiss vs. AustriansScotlandColumbusNetherlands vs. SpanishArmadaPilgrimsIndia - interesting that he considers that India was best ruled by England. Doubt the Indians thought so.Lexington and Bunker HillIf you have any interest in history, I would definitely say pick this up. There were four of these that I didn't know that much about, so a worthwhile read for me as a history buff."
5,Good perspective on the past,"This was a great read! It moved along at a good pace and was informative. I did feel that it was somewhat myopic as even in acknowledging flaws or shortcomings in some characters and peoples involved it still celebrated a few bloody, oppressive affairs as great victories for the World. The one-sided views were however very informative of the author's historical perspective."
4,Interesting summary,"Interesting book, summarizes in a proper way the events toldUnfortunately it forgets events held on 19th and 20th centuries"
2,Ten Great Events In History,"The events themselves were interesting but I found myself noticing the large number of misspellings, the overly poetic language, etc.For a book to be published with this large number of misspellings and grammatical errors is poor scholarship.I was not impressed."
2,UGH,"I'm really glad I didn't pay for this, mostly useless book. Poorly written, diffecult read, should have sampled it first."
5,omg,best book ever better then enything iv`e ever read. every time i read it i laft and i laft and i laft it is no question the best book ever
3,Ten Great Events in History,"I enjoy reading about historical events and how some events can turn world history. Unfortunately, this did not take me there. I read through the first several features but finished unfulfilled and lacking any conclusions."
3,ten great events of history,I absolutely couldn't believe that the author did not mention about 1800 BC when Abraham left Ur and migrated to Palestine. To me this one of the greatest watershed dates in all of history. I think he was lax in registering other events in ancient times. I'm disappointed with this book. JMM
2,Not Impressed,"Not sure if this was strictly an ebook or not, but can see cutting down trees to print it. Dry and dull may be the best way to put it."
4,Good enough,"The writing and interpretation of historical events is dated, but the book was free and was a pretty quick read."
4,Pretty good book for free,It was interesting reading a book written over 100 years ago. It sparked my interest to learn more of the events he described. I wasnt expected to be blown away by this book. This was great book for free.
5,The pinnacle of their career,"In their day, Entombed were untouchable. While many consider their debut ""Left Hand Path"" to be their best, I prefer ""Clandestine"" as it is heavier and more polished, while retaining the leaden heaviness and aggression of its predecessor. The track ""Living Dead"" has to be one of the most face ripping openings to an album of all time. No messing around, straight into it. Listening to this album is best done in one sitting, as an entirety, rather than dissected track by track. Even though vocalist LG Petrov was temporarily absent from the band during the recording, the vocals of Alex Hellid (not Johnny Dordevic, as the liner notes say) are the most brutal the band produced in their recording career.After ""Clandestine"" Entombed's career took a downward slide into the murky world of ""Death n' Roll"", almost completely deserting their death metal roots. If only they had continued further down the Left Hand Path..."
3,a small step down,"mosh parts aside, clandestine rings with eerie ambience and a newfound slayer-esque dissonance that makes it much a more sinister and creepy album than the classic left hand path before it. the cavernous production, conservative horror movie sampling and typically abrasive chainsaw guitar tone only magnify the inexplicable malevolence of this simple material. the only thing that really sucks about it is that petrov was left out of the recording for unknown reasons, leaving nicke's bone-headed, over-the-top performance to fill his shoes. ""mwah hah hah hah!""clandestine wasn't the beginning of the end for this band (that's where wolverine blues comes in), but it sort of feels like an inessential slideshow of nice, crunchy riffage that might have been worked into better and more complete songs with more time/initiative and decent vocals. with some reservations, I call this the last good entombed album."
5,essential DM!!!!!,"To make this extremely short. If you are to own 5 real metal CD's in your life..include this one in your collection. It has the trademark ""buzzsaw"" guitar sound that made them famous(along with other swedish DM bands at the time).Great Production!! Besides this , the only other album worth buying is Left Hand Path. The rest just never came close to the energy and ferocity their first to works had.ENJOY!!"
4,SLICING THROATS AT AN INSANE RATE,"I didnt like Clandestine as much as I did their masterpeice of a debut ""Left Hand Path,"" but it's still a great album. The main thing for me is the vocals... It was actually Nicke Anderson, former drummer, that stepped up & did the vox on the album even though it doesn't say in the CD booklet because LG Petrov was temporarly kicked out of the band. He does have some great sounding vox here & there, but personally I think LG did a better job. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Aside from the vox, the album itself is pretty good. Some songs are slower & chug along instead of total all-out thrash, such as ""Evilyn,"" but that also makes it different & unique. All & all, its a good album well worth listening to."
4,An advance from Left Hand Path,"Clandestine holds the same place in the Entombed catalogue as does Carcass' Necroticism. It's an advance from their debut, but they both would progress further.One thing to point out, when this disc was released in 1991, there were many criticisms about the vocals. LG and Nicke had a falling out after Left Hand Path. Jonny Dordevic, the bass player from the classic band Carnage, was recruited to be the singer. However, he doesn't sing on Clandestine either. The vocals are none other than Nicke himself. They were guide vocals for Jonny to learn, but he never did. He lasted one tour with Entombed before Nicke asked LG to join Entombed again.A curious piece of history told to me by Ross of Immolation many many years ago."
4,"Visual Pleasure, Reading Delight, Culinary Joy","This is the fourth copy of ""The Glass Pantry"" I've purchased. It's not simply because Ms. Brennan is one of the rare writers in my experience who combines marvelous writing skills with exciting culinary skills.The ""Pantry"" purchases were also made because friends expressed an interest, especially in the current economy, in canning and pickling and I think this is one of the more encouraging and easily utilized books for someone who cooks pretty well but wants to expand their skills. I won't go so far as to say that all three of the people who were gifted with this book started pickling within 10 minutes or even 10 days, but I can say comfortably that they were delighted with the book and periodically call to say that they've tried a new recipe. It's a reaction that keeps me buying the book for new people.I should add that I'm probably going to have to buy a fifth book pretty soon because my own copy is getting pretty disreputable."
4,Gorgeous,"It's not a comprehensive guide -- you can't go looking for a specific recipe, most likely -- but there's at least one good (and beautifully photographed) recipe for most every seasonal ingredient."
4,Early Billy wilder script,"Very impressive comedy of the 30s with a sophisticated Paramount gloss, terrific Hollywood stars of the period, and most of all, a corker of a Billy Wilder script.The leads, here, are a perfect representations of their usual idealized images from past films, butthe support is incredible, with Mary Astor, working up to her zany best in THE PALM BEACH STORY, and John Barrymore, deep into his late career doldrums, giving the wryly hammy performance to end all performances."
3,Excellent Screwballs,"Here Claudette Colbert blithely parlays her ""It Happened One Night"" style onto the Paris scene. She doesn't have Gable for a foil, but Don Ameche is remarkably adept as a stand-in and the clever old rascal John Barrymore makes the whole plot boil. Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, two old pros, have cleverly shaped an old and familiar story line into a fine little piece of Hollywood comedy."
2,dvd print very poor movie wonderful,"Everyone agrees its a wonderful movie. I have an old print on VHS from 20 years ago and was thrilled about getting a DVD. Disappointed to say that print quality is about the same as my old VHS, very grainy and even blotchy in places."
5,A great romantic comedy - one of Ameche's finest moments!,"Claudette Colbert and Don Ameche costar in this charming comedy... She's a down-and-out singer who's come to Paris by train, riding on her last dime; he's the irrepressibly flirtatious local cabbie who tries to charm his way into her life, and who searches all across the city she she gives him the slip. Colbert's as cute as ever, but this film is a real treat for folks who haven't seen much of Ameche: forget about those lame Sonia Henje films; this is Ameche at his best."
5,Very amusing!,"I sure do enjoy films like this! This is one of those silly old movies that never made me laugh out loud, but I had an amused smirk on my face practically the whole time.I never really knew how to define a screwball comedy before, but this movie illustrates the genre perfectly. The whole plot is so ridiculously mixed up it's hard to even describe it! Suffice it to say that there is good acting and clever plot/lines throughout.If you like old romantic comedies a la Preston Sturges, Frank Capra, etc., I highly recommend this movie. If you prefer Caddyshack or Spaceballs, well, why in the world are you even reading this review? ;0)"
2,Disappointing Reading,"When I first read this book I was expecting a story about ""a lesbian mother's fight for her son."" In reality, very little of this book deals with the author's family situation and relationship with her son. Most of the book chroncicles the author's political activism and there is compartively little dealing with her partner or child. A profound disappointment"
3,Nice Detailed Reference Book. Well Documented.,I read this book back in 1956. I refer to this book first when I have a question or need to see an example.
3,Interesting,"I don't normally like books fictionalizing Bibical characters, but I read this book because it was given to me and I was curious. I had not even remembered Abigail was a wife of David. The book got me interested in the events as portrayed in the Bible, and if for that reason only it was worth reading. I can't say that I can fully accept the character of Abigail as portrayed in this book. For some reason, the language sounds too modern. Put perhaps I am being too critical. It is worth reading as it makes the events in the book of Samuel a little bit more clear."
5,Teens Remember,This book truly expresses the beliefs of real teens. The poems came from the heart as where they were felt. God Bless America!
5,Through the Eyes of Freedom,"This is such a touching book, I got my copy in the mail today and read it immediatly. While I am partial to the book (im in it) I truly believe it shows how devoted teens are to America. So many times are teens labled ""uncaring"" and thought of as not knowing whats going in the world. Well if anyone still has doubts read this book and you'll see just how much teens care about our country."
5,It Works!,"When I opened ""Take Heart! Stories of Encouragement,"" I thought I'd take time to read at least one chapter. A couple hours later, I had finished the book and immediately made a list of words to describe my Mr. Right. Just a few days later, a wonderful man entered my life.Amy has the innate ability to blend practicality with idealism, which inspired me, (a happily-single-for-over-25-years-Ms.), to prepare myself for participating in romance with enthusiasm and joyfulness. Just a few days after completing my list, a wonderful man entered my life. Thanks, Amy, for sharing your insight and wisdom with us! Way to go, Coach."
2,Stops a little short.,"Although the first 2 flicks were great 3 and 4 lack the brutality of Phillip Rhee fists and kicks. Don't worry about acting Phillip, stick to martial arts."
4,Best of the Best 3 and 4,"The whole series deals with the same main principle, honor. These men showed that they could over come obsticles and achieve their goals. Things are not always as we'd like for them to be, but with honor and perservarence, you can acheive much. Especially with friends, and family by your side."
3,A good try from Rhee and Co.,"""Best of the Best 3"" is clearly not the most outstanding installment in the series. Although it was a good try to stray from the classical plot of martial arts competition (as seen in ""Best of the Best 1&2""), it just didn't do it for me as it's first 2 predecessors.To see Rhee and Co at their best, the first two movies are a must. Alexander Grady was sorely missed in this movie."
4,Good....but,"I have just recently ""discovered"" the Moon Island Series. I enjoyed this book almost in it's entirety. I say almost because, first the character development was a little weak. Second, I was enjoying it until the momentwhen Annabel simply jumps into bed with Rose. The joke didn't escape me, I assure you. She jumped in the sack with Rose Beecham...funny, Jennifer.The only problem I found with that is that it cheapened Annabel's persona a bit. Guess old habits are hard to break. She couldn't help but revert to her old self. Pity, because while the author ""painted"" Cody as a level headed person that confronted her feelings head on and with hope for a future; Annabel had to jump in bed with a stranger one more time beforefacing her own feelings and while she's doing that she forgot all about Cody and how she was going out of her way to keep Annabel's guests safe and even went as far as trying to clear the landing path so that Annabel could have a safe landing. Isn't love grand?"
4,I bought these as a gag...,"One of the decks is titled Black Deck Tiger and the other is called Ghost. I bought this trio for the Ghost mostly. I have non-Hodgkins-lymphoma and my continued presence is in some doubt for my poker group. I thought that Ghost might be a good gag for them. It was but... They were a little spooked about playing with the deck. And, as we are mostly 60+ more than a few of the guys were not inclined to play without the large imprint cards that we now customarily play with.I have been using the Black Deck Tiger set for playing real-life solitaire and other games at home. We've had fun with them.I gave the red deck to my son-in-law as soon as they arrived. I've heard no complaint from him."
5,Scream is great!,"Dave Grohl's played with this early band, Scream, and because he played with them, and the drumming is awesome, I give it five stars."
4,"Solid wood construction, easy assembly","This bookcase was delivered by UPS yesterday in a well-padded, 5 ft. box. The packaging is very solid to protect the glass shelves. No parts were missing or broken on delivery. If you have built an Ikea desk or book case, this will be very similar. I used a screwdriver and hammer to build the bookcase in approx. 2 hours. They recommend building this with 2 people, but I'm hard headed and built it by myself. I would recommend having a 2nd person around to hold the glass doors in place as they are mounted and screwed down.The instructions are well laid out with individual pouches for all of the pieces, labeled with Letters that correspond to the assembly instructions. I would buy again from Oxford as the quality of the wood and assembly were simple."
2,Bad design,This top has a very awkward fit. I don't know how to describe it but it's just one of those tops that looks like it has different features sized for different people! Or maybe it was just with my size (M). I don't wear it much.
2,Don't waste your money,"I've bought lots of DVDs through Amazon. This is the first time I've written a review. I felt compelled so no one would waste there money expecting to get a workout DVD.I bought this DVD based on reviews from others. I expected to get a workout DVD. I would have given it 1 star, but the DVD was well put together it's just not a workout DVD.If you want to learn a very small amount of classical moves, but you aren't interested in a great work out spend the $. I viewed this DVD but haven't done it.The dance steps are taught as follows:1) slow motion; 2) full speed; 3) in combination 1; 4) in combination 2; 5) combination 1 & 2.Most of the DVD is instructional. Only a small part is done with the full combination for maybe 5 to 10 minutes. If you have a remote that jumps between scenes I guess you could put all the combinations 1 & 2 together to create a workout that's about 30 minutes. Why bother."
5,Some Kid who are awesome.,"have you ever seen a car that flies?. How about a motorized ice cream cone?Well get ready to believe your eyes! Ripley's has discovered the world's unbelievable inventions and the extraordinary people who brought their unusual ideas to life. Do you have what it takes to be an inventive inventor? Test your creative powers by taking the IMAGINE THAT! quizzes and Ripley's super tricky ""Brain Busters"". Who knows? With a little imagination, your own wacky ideas might become the world's weirdest gadgets!"
2,"Confusing directions, charts and set up","The designs in this leaflet are quite pretty and challenging. You can easily substitute pink for blue or yellow and green if you don't know the sex of the baby.The charts could use some work. The total height and width in stitches for each piece is not listed so you are guessing when you start to stitch, hoping the canvas piece you are using is big enough.The finishing directions take several read-throughs.The organization of the leaflet is poor. The chart and directions for each piece are on totaly different pages making it difficult to match what chart goes with what directions."
3,Another tasty dish of Hollywood on wry!,"Journalist/gossipmeister Boze Hadleigh has done it again in ""In and Out."" I've read, reread, and thoroughly enjoyed his earlier ""Hollywood Babble On,"" ""Hollywood and Whine,"" and ""Celebrity Feuds,"" and while this latest isn't quite on the same level as those others, it doesn't disappoint. Like Hadleigh's earlier books, it's a fascinating read. My only complaint is just this: Much too much of the Ellen DeGereres and Anne Heche thing. I'm reminded of what the former said in an inteview not long ago: ""Are you tired of hearing about me? I've got news for you, I'm tired of hearing about me."" But that's a minor complaint. Bottom line: Whether you're gay, straight, bi, or just enjoy celebrity gossip at its juiceist and funniest, ""In and Out"" is Hollywood on wry served to perfection by a master chef."
3,Nice storage option,"It's tough to get excited about something as basic as this. It's a good, economical way to store your spices (just as long ast they don't come in a tall bottle). There are a lot of far more expensive and stylish options out there, but many of them require transferring the spice from its original container to the more decorative one. Too much trouble for me. This is simple and functional."
3,"Iveys stuff is the best, the rest, so-so","If you're a Badfinger fan, the Iveys tracks are a must. The rest of these tracks are OK, but there's a reason they weren't hits..."
3,"Great Iveys tracks, the rest mediocre","As a big Badfinger fan, this was a must purchase. The Iveys tracks are really nice to have in my collection. The rest is simply ok. The person writing the liner notes would have you believe that the rest are lost shoulda-been hits- gems. That is simply very far from the truth. They are merely anachronistic samples of a bygone era. Interesting only as a reminder of what else was going on musically at the time, besides what the biggies like the Beatles, Stones, and Who were doing. For fans of the genre, Iveys/Badfinger or pop music historians only"
2,Not a good book for sufferers,"Although this book provided a lot of information about self injury, I felt that it was more geared towards doctors/therapists than to people who hurt themselves. I found it very technical and a little impersonal. It offered so many different possible explanation for self injury that all it actually ended up saying was that no one really knows why people deliberately hurt themselves. I also didn't like the way it referred to self injury as ""self mutilation"" throughout the book. It is too harsh a term, and not one that sufferers like to use or hear. Overall, the book gives much information about self injury, some of it very scientific, but it is not the best choice if you are a person who hurts yourself."
4,Excellent Book,I found this book to be extremely informative and will use it as significant reference in my profession. I will also recommend this book to other interested parties.
1,Completely Insulting,Beating a dead horse here but body modification is not self-mutilation. Armando Favazza flaunts a narrow world-view that he goes to great lengths to justify. There are many people doing great things in the field of psychiatry. Favazza is not one of them.
1,not quite the whole story,"as a piercer, and enthusiest of piercing and tattooing, i found the body modification section of this book judgemental and narrow minded. favazza does not diffrencate between personal decoration and self modification. decoration is not mutalation, and many, many tattooed and pierced people, including myself, do not consider it bad, or an effect of low self esteem or anything remotely resembling self abuse. i found this book biased and not informative at all, at least the body modification part, the rest, i cannot say, as i have never mutilated my body."
1,Armando has lost his mind,I've met this guy a few times. Cat is stuck on him self. Maybe if he would take time to understand people instead of worrying about himself he would get it.
3,It's no where near as cool as their other stuff,"I'm sorry to say this- outside a couple of cool tracksthis doesn't hold my interest. Some songs, like the titletrack are awesome. Other tracks like ""Meltdown"" are sonicallydissonant, trippy and are heavy numbers. Then there's the boringremix material that does absolutely nothing for me. Overall-I'd say it's worth for the 4 or 5 cool tracks- skip the dancey Remix ......"
2,Works OK,I'm not real impressed with this vers. of Photoshop Elements. I thought version 1 was better. This is good for basic photo editing and that's about it. Look for version 6.0 for the mac in 2008. Hopefully vers. 6 is better.
4,looks good as replacement for phsp 7,"Haven't used it much yet, but it has all the tools I'm used to and more."
4,Adobe opens a new world to photographers,"My experience in using Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 (Mac) has been positive and rewarding, making the hard-to-see suddenly clearly visible, and increasing the accuracy of the image. Many photographers will, no doubt, find this system valuable beyond expectations."
1,won't install in my Mac,"I could not install the program on my Mac, even though the program was the Macintosh version. I spent hours on the phone with Adobe customer service. The problem was ""missing a key file"" and we could not resolve the problem. Now I am trying to get Adobe to refund my money, and am having trouble with a ""proof of purchase.""Anyway, I am sure it is a good program but I will not be using it."
2,Adobe PS Elements 4.0 (Mac),"Very difficult interface - windoz like, not Mac like. Would not recommend it unless you have a LOT OF TIME to spend learning the product. It does lots of things, if you have the time to learn how to accomplish."
1,NOT SATISFIED,"This product is misleading. It does not organize pictures the same way with the collections and labels, as it does on a PC. The Adobe staff(several of them) all told me that the pictures with labels, would transfer no probem from the PC to the MAC. This could not be further from the truth. I am disappointed with the product and would like a refund."
5,Good Product and Easy to use,"This edition of Photoshop Elements 4.0 for the Mac is a big improvement over the previous version. I'm not the most computer literate person, but have had success with this program."
1,Not usable for Mac OX 10.4.8,"I was disappointed when I discovered that I could not use Elements version 4.0 on my new Mac 10.4.8. I had to return it and got credit for it. Photoshop Elements does not seem to compatible with Intel duo core processors in these new Macs. Apparently Adobe has not made it usable yet for this new Mac. When I ordered it, I read that it worked for 10.4, which was not the whole truth.Dorothy Bausch"
2,Batch Processing Blues,This is my first use of any PhotoShop product and I am not very impressed. I edit (retouch and then resize) hundreds of outdoor photos for slideshows and make extensive use of the Auto Smart Fix feature (it usually gives me what I want first try)but when I try to use the batch process feature to do 200 image file 50 images at a time (for Smart Fix or Resize to new folder)Elements 4 is hopeless. The batch processor scrambles the order of the output and it can take hours to unscramble them. Best not to even use this feature unless you are working with very small batches.I found it imposssible to email Adobe Support for any suggestions from them on this problem so I am going to look elsewhere for the batch processing capability I want.
2,Slow and clumsy,"I bought the elements ready to take on my photo library and have fun editing. Unfortunately, after photoshop successfully and easily organized my photos, the rest was downhill. If you're in the market for a photo organizer, this is a great product, but if you want to edit photos in ANY way, don't get your hopes up. It is exhaustingly clumsy! It's editing functions are not user friendly, are slow, and it even freezes regularly while editing. I give this 2 stars for it's organizing capabilities and 0 stars for it's editing capabilities. I'll probably try a few other products or keep this one for organizing and use another for editing until someone gets it right."
2,doesn't work with newer MACs,Be careful -- I learned the hard way that this does not work with newer MACs -- so it is totally useless to me now.
2,Wait for 6.0,"Beware...this and all earlier versions of Elements will NOT work on Macs with Intel processors, i.e., the majority of newer Macs. However, Elements 6.0 for Mac due out at the end of March is created to work with the Intel processors so make sure you buy the product that matches your Mac's PROCESSOR TYPE .rather than its operating system."
1,Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0,"This book was represented as a Mac tutorial. Nowhere in this manual does it mention a Mac, nor is it represented as a Mac tutorial. I was very disappointed with this. So if you are looking for a Mac manual, this IS NOT it!Also, as a tutorial for the PC version, it is out-dated as Photoshop Elements as already proceeded to version 6."
1,R-U-B-B-I-S-H,"As a Large Format film based photographer that simply scans Color Transparencies, or Black & White Negatives I'd have to rate Elements 4.0 for my Mac as PURE RUBBISH! Previously I owned and used Elements 2.0, which I'm going back to using, which allowed me to scan and adjust at a higer dpi, and bit rate. When I read about Elements 4.0 initially some of the features sounded interesting. Once I bought and isntalled the software it became obvious that for my intended use that I was severely handicapped by the restrictions incorporated in the 4.0 version."
1,Not on my Mac 10.5,"Used PS ad PSE for years and loved it. PSE does not and per Adobe will not work on Mac OS 10.5. Too bad, now I use GIMP"
3,Adobe customer support,"I purchased Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 for Macintosh. Installation was a nightmare. The error message simply said, ""a required file is missing."" Not much help there. I tried online help. Nothing worked. Finally I called customer service. I waited a minimum of 30 minutes each time I was shuffled from person to person. The Muzak was terribly degraded, adding to my frustration. After numerous attempts, I finally got through to tech services. The gentleman walked me through a difficult fix that was not on the Adobe help website. I learned two things:1. In safe mode, log out of your account and create a new account called WORKING with no password. See if the program will load from that account.2. Tech support is on Pacific time, so call 8:00 a.m. PT. The gentleman who helped me said they're slow first thing in the morning."
2,not elementary,"To be honest, my only goal was to alter photos in a simple way and then title them in a blank space below the photo. I found this to be next to impossible. As of this date I have yet to accomplish it."
4,Nice Read and Good Information,I enjoyed reading this book. It gave a good overview of Queen Victoria's life. The information was complete and pertinent.I also found it to be a very quick read.
2,"Queen Victoria, essential autobiography","Really enjoyed this book, it was easy to read, had lots of information on Queen Victoria and her 9 children and of course, her much loved husband. I actually enjoyed it so much that I downloaded another autobiography on Queen Victoria's children. She was known as the ""mother"" of Europe, as her children were married to various Princes and princesses, and became Kings and Queens as well."
1,black out,I bought mine dec 2005. great price and great picture. 10 months later everything went black. 3 weeks for the parts - total rebuild minus the screen. they said they have had problems and this is a standard fix paid $1300 for the tv and the tech said if i had to buy the parts it would have been $1200 plus i did have to pay $178 in labor. he talked me into extending the warrenty for another year for $278. six months later all black again. 2 weeks down - found a loose wire in a harness and replaced the board it connected to. now i have half a screen and am down another 3 weeks and still waiting for the parts for another total rebuild.----you be the judge---they are lucky this isn't college football season---PSU!
4,not so bad,"it sounds like the tv's that the other two people bought were dropped. a friend and i bought our tv's a little over a year ago and i haven't had any problems with mines at all. her tv is still working and the quality is great! my only issue is that i had to get digital cable because the regular coaxial would not work with this tv, hope this helps!"
1,Terrible Quality!,"I made the big mistake of getting this monitor because it was so cheap. The first one I bought had a large yellow vertical band right through the middle of the plasma screen, so I returned it (that's not a simple operation- This unit weighs about 60 pounds and comes in a very large box). The second one worked pretty well for a while, but after 8 months, the screen suddenly went black. No more Haier products for me!"
3,HOT CHICKS IN SPACESUITS,"CHIRALITY may be kinda hard to follow at times, but the art by Satoshi Urushihara kept me turning the pages until the very end.Urishihara's grasp of the female form is second to none, and to say that I didn't have a lecherous thought or two while the cast took me on their intergalactic adventures would be nothing less than misleading.All in all, CHIRALITY is goofy and fun, but it's the incredible art that will get me to check out Book 2."
2,never the same,"I wanted to like this cd because i am a big fan of this band , but they were never the same when they got a new singer , all the albums with just the three brothers rock , but i was disapointed with this one . Its not bad just not as good as the others in my opinion ."
1,Unreadable,"This book is so badly written it is largely unreadable. Many sections are pure babble.I hoped for exercises but it is a ""Tell, don't show"" book.The author's arrogance is tiresome, to say the least. Nancy Kress, Character, Emotion and Viewpoint is a vastly more professional book."
5,"Great stories with quick, effective, complex points","I have no doubt that the short story is the hardest to write. With limited space, the point, and there can really be only one, must be relatively obvious, yet complex enough to make an interesting story. Adding in a science fiction theme increases the level of difficulty, as generally, such stories require more explanation of the circumstances. Given that an environment different from the usual is necessary, some space must be used to explain the background of the story.Despite all these hurdles, it is possible to write quality stories and this collection is an existence proof of how well it can be done. Independent of the length, these are some of the best science fiction stories of all time. They range from puns to the possibilities of interstellar war. I started the book and kept it close so that I could read it during every spare moment. It is one of the best collections of science fiction stories that I have ever read."
4,Worth Every Penny,"This book does exactly what the title says it does. All those quotes you use from time to time and never know the source are now a thing of the past. I wrote a book once called ""The First Casualty"", taken from the quote ""The first casualty when war comes is truth."" I looked it up in this book and there it all was--who said it, where and when and an assessment of the value to place on each attribution. The book is worth every penny you pay for it."
4,Perfect for the target audience,"If you are a quote enthusiast who loves to know the history behind the quotes, this is a very good book for you. I am a purist, and just enjoy reading great quotes and having a source to attribute them to, so the extra information got in the way of my enjoyment a bit. I definitely think that people who enjoy the background information will love this book. If that's you, enjoy!Todd HagopianPresident/CEOHagopian InstituteAuthor of the popular ""Quote Junkie"" book sereies and the brand new ""Idiom Junkie"" series"
4,A great intro to a variety of reggae artists,"Buy this CD and you'll get a good snapshot of the different kinds of reggae that are happening in the '90s, although it was released 9 years ago. Especially strong are Foxy Brown's (not the hip-hop artist) smooth and soulful ""Baby It's You,"" the infectious ""Shuffle the Deck"" by Roots Radics, Yellowman's socially conscious ""AIDS,"" and Israel Vibration's flowing ""Payday."" Other tracks are not so strong and would not stand alone."
1,"Poorly written, poorly edited, poorly designed.","This was required reading for a web applications class. I am sorry I wasted money on it. The writing alternated between tedious and redundant. The editing was so bad I found typos in every page. The graphics looked like something out of an elementary school art project. More important, they interfered with the text and made it difficult to read. Every page was an eyesore. What little valuable information I could glean from the text wasn't worth the wading. The publisher should be ashamed. Midway through the course, I threw the book in a corner in disgust. Save your money."
3,"Great information, lousy design.","I found much useful information in this book though it wasn't easy, wading through all the typos and sidebars which blended the backgroud color to the text color. Nearly unreadable. Mr. Ivler's book was not done justice by this publisher."
1,No Place to be: Voices of Homeless Children,"You sent me the wrong book, you sent me Violent Voices instead."
1,"Low level descriptions, lack of useful information, out of date","Can't believe how lousy this book is. We just went to Cancun, and much of the information here is out of date. The ""must-see"" place claimed by the book such as las Pallapas, is just an empty, run-down, lifeless square in the afternoon. Surroundings of the square looks unpleasing as well. Can't find any really useful tip for Cancun."
3,This is the B grade product,"A different offering than this one, also from Media Supply, is the ""A grade line"" (Item # JCDR-ZZSB - this one here is the B grade product. There is no difference in description except the item number, and so I had to call the vendor to find out for sure. I mistakenly bought this item last time I purchased blank discs, based on another review here, and thought I had the right ones because it had the recommended # of digits on the label; however, the better quality disc is just a few dollars more and that is what I will buy from now on. While I had no trouble with the B grade discs I purchased, and the rep told me there's not much difference there is SOME difference. For me, it's worth a couple of bucks to avoid bubbles in the coating or other defects. Neither one of these is archive quality, though - MAMA or Verbatim Gold is much more money if that's what you want."
2,Not Worth It,"After doing some research I was led to believe that I would be best off buying these made in Japan JVC cdr's for high quality & lack of defective discs. I take my music collection seriously & simply want a very good quality cdr to burn music on to. First time out using these Taiyo Yuden cdr's 1 of 4 newly burned discs would not play on my CD player. What gives? This is the precise reason I paid up for better quality discs, very frustrating. I've had a better experience using TDK's & Maxell's over the years."
1,Good Product And ...,"This is my third review after the previous two have been censored out. Purchased item (100pk of Taiyo Yuden/JVC optical discs in cake box) shipped with long delay. Product inside the box arrived not in the original manufacturer packaging and damaged from either being put inside the box this way or was torn apart (I mean totally apart - base, spindle, cover all separate and many discs badly scratched) during transportation due to inadequate product packaging lacking proper padding. Original manufacturer UPC code was relabeled with a different UPC code. Item marked as fulfilled by Am.."
1,BEWARE! THE CDs ARE BAD QUALITY!,I bought the Taiyo Cds and got only errors.I tried others manufacturers with success.Most of the good reviews here are posted by people from Taiyuo Yuden Company to fool customers.Beware!
5,Good Quality,"Unlike some other Cd's I've used , with these most all of them work. I do not know how the mailman managed to squeeze this package into my mail box. Had to cut the box and pull real hard to remove it. This is the 4th time I have ordered these Cd's from Amazon, yet the 1st time they were found in the mailbox. I will order more from Amazon."
2,Hull filled Popcorn,"This Orville popcorn should be sold with a warning. ""Lots of hulls, choking hazard"". Yes it pops up nicely with few unpopped kernels. It tastes great. But, it is dangerous. Those hulls get caught in your throat and are very difficult to wash down or cough up. So you choke on it until you can get it to move."
5,Great snack option,"We've had to eliminate many snack items for health reasons.Since we've had this popcorn on hand, we've enjoyed it several times a week.Unlike some we've tried, this pops up well every time.You don't end up with two inches of unpopped kernals in the bottom of the bowl.Tastes great and helps to keep us from thinking about some of the less healthy snacks we no longer have on hand."
2,not much on butter flavor,"i like buttery popcorn so though i would give this a try. i liked the way the popcorn popped and there were very few unpopped kernels in the pac. although this popcorn looked buttered, as most of the kernels had yellow on them, it did not taste like butter at all. i have nothing against the kernels as they were fluffy, but basically not much on the butter flavor. i was disappointed."
3,Functions As Desired,"Having found myself in the possesion of a battered HP dv6000 (keyboard missing keys, power adapter receptable not functioning), I decided to turn it into a desktop for our 10 year old. One HP XB3000 and Ubuntu linux install later, and I had:1. A laptop I could power up (via the Auxillary Port connection to the XB3000, not the normal laptop power port)2. A functioning USB keyboardThe XB3000 is a litte clunky, but I did like the ability to elevate the laptop at an angle, so that the screen viewing angle is more suitable for our child's small desk."
5,This is exactly what I wanted!!!,"I'm not sure why other people are complaining, this is exactly what I needed. The power cord from your laptop will power the Port Replicator, and the Port Replicator powers the laptop. It's great, saves wear and tear on the ports (I'd already broken one USB port over the years) and it allows for a quick disconnect to take in the other room if you want to move around. It's perfect. The little things are what make this product, the variable angle tilt, the cutout on the front for you to use the headphone and microphone jacks on the front of the laptop itself. Speakers are fantastic, good bass (much better than the laptop speakers.) and the power button works. Everything feels solidly made and has a nice heft. It is definitely hefty, weighs a good 15 pounds or so. Overall, a great product at a great price."
1,"A total, complete nightmare.","A total nightmare. Gone through Two in a year and now this one same problems - when you re-connect the computer everything goes nuts. Printer drivers go bonkers. External monitor will not come back on. NOTHING but problems and HP Product Support (a oxymoron) has been, well ... utterly moronic. Many hours on the phone. Several escalations. No one at HP seems to have even a hint of a clue as to these problems which I have reported many times. I paid twice the price for both of mine so that they are now so cheap is telling. You do NOT get what you pay for. Indeed if time is money this will cost you plenty. Guaranteed to drive you nuts. CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not worth the price,"Expansion base does not come with power supply needed to power the station, and you have to use the one that comes with your notebook because the station does not charge your computer. The speakers work wonderfully. The touch buttons work well also on the front of the base. The sensor on the wireless mouse is weak, therefore you cant get any real distance from the computer. There are several usb ports, and the station looks cool, but it is really heavy and really overpriced."
2,Product failed after 6 months,"The xb3000 was an excellent setup for several months. I would have wished for a PCIE slot or side scrolling on the mousewheel, but these are niggles.After using it for a while though, it started to get very... particular about how I plugged it in. Sometimes audio would not work properly or USB devices would not be recognized unless I plugged the station in very firmly from a specific angle. After another month, I have lost all audio functionality.HP's warranty on this device is very short, and paying for repairs would likely cost more than the $150 it would cost to replace the unit.Since the product was so good up until failure, I will try one more time. But be very careful. These seem prone to shorts in the cable, and audio seems to go first from poking around the internet."
2,Amazon Verified Purchase,This book was not described accurately in the reviews nor the product description. It should have stated that this was not the color photo edition. The one I received was not in color and was line drawings which did not look like the flowers nor enable me to ditinguish differences from others - very dissappointing. It disturbs me to have to pay shipping to return an item that was not accurately described on Amazon.com.
4,Loving Jack,"This was a good book, I didn't feel it was quite up to par with Nora's other books but enjoyable. It was an easy read."
3,A easy read,If your looking for an easy read on a cold and rainy afternoon then this will meet your needs - enjoy
4,beginning nora,"i really do enjoy her current stuff (rivers end, the reef) but it is always great to pick up one of the older books by nora roberts that read in a day. sometimes i just dont feel like thinking that much when trying to relax with a book, (bag of bones by stephen king is/was getting on my nerves) so taking a break and tearing thur one of noras has brought me back to relaxation ::smile"
2,Outdated; weak characters,"One of my favorite authors, but this early work disappointed. I expected stronger characters and a riviting plot, but neither was there. I am now a little gun shy of these ""InterMix"" publishings showing up on Kindle."
3,Loving Jack,"I am crazy about Nora Roberts books, but this one didn't keep me up at night wanting to know what would happen next."
1,Boring,This is clearly one of Nora Roberts early works as the storyline is very underdeveloped. It reads almost like a modern day Barbara Cartland. I sped read through most of it because of boredom.
3,"Prada Women's Roll Quilted Bag, Nero","Its Real Prada brand,you get the certificate in the purse.But its just a litle mini handbag for just some small items to carry like just for a dinner ect,so dont let the picture fool you that its bigger its a mini one.Its really nice quality, and its cute./Mireille"
2,Not very good at all.,"The Book Description suggests a simple journey through depravity and dementia: murder/suicide, isolation/imprisonment, etc. In actuality, the nature of the story is quite different; muddled with second-rate fantasy-world characters and settings EVERYWHERE, it's not the down and dirty sort of realism I expected. I bet his short stories are quite good, but I wouldn't trust him again with anything more than twenty pages long."
5,"Weird, wild stuff here, kids","A very weird book that hits on all cylinders. Creepy, effective, with plenty of sub-plots to keep the story humming along in a very strange fashion. A brew of oddity that will go down well with horror fans who are sick of the same old tepid tea."
2,Flowery writing.,"The potentially excellent plot of this story is hindered from ever being realized by the author's ornate writing style. The book did not raise any fears within, simply because of the hideous overtones of ""artistic"" writing. The characters are not well developed, and the story reads very slowly. There are times in the plot when you are not sure which character is where. Tom Piccirilli's books will not be gracing my bookshelves any time soon."
2,I want to like Tom Piccirilli...,"...but this is my second attempt at reading his work and will probably be my last. There's nothing wrong with Piccirilli's imagination. He brings all sorts of interesting and neat ideas to the table when he writes, but his prose and narration are a REAL obstacle for me. I don't know if it's an attempt to be ""literary"" or what, but I find it to be very convoluted and difficult to follow. It just kills the story for me, I'm sorry. Kinda like watching a good movie with a whole lotta static. It's too difficult for me to see beyond it. I wish him all the best, though. A lot of people really seem to like him..."
5,"Thought-provoking, imaginative, and weird","Fascinating, stylish, and very very weird, this novel tosses in plots and sub-plots you just don't expect to be merged together. On one level this is the story of a writer who returns to his haunted home ten years after the bizarre tragedy when his sister went insane and murdered the rest of the family. But there's so much more to it. Dialogue with ghosts, women trapped in a house that brings to life their own sins from the past, animal-man-like creatures in the forest called ""muses"" and an unfinished book that seems to be forcing its way into reality. This one has something for everybody with plenty of oddity tossed in along the way. Well-worth checking out."
2,Too much fluff,"This book seemed to be a conglomeration of bad poetry, or a written representation of performance art. Too much jerking around from obscure scene to scene, too many peripheral events going on that are left unexplained or seem to come from nowhere. In my opinion, pretentious, and not a cohesive storyline."
2,Style over Substance,"Don't expect a particularly intense horror novel. All intensity is driven out by muddled use of adverbs and convoluted plot threads. Horror of any sort, suggested or explicit, does not enter the story into well over 50 pages and the book isn't very long. Instead the first half of the book is about the lead character wandering between reality, fantasy, and memories. However, the author does not create a character with whom I can empathize with. Disappointing, dry of emotion, but a couple nicely written sentences."
1,The Book Made For Good Cat-Box Lining,"Any positive, five-star review you see listed here is a *lie.*While the book, THE DECEASED, was written well (obviously, if it were accepted by a book publisher!), the storyline was so incredibly jarring, the writing ""voice"" so rigid and perplexing, the offbeat description so ridiculous that--like many have mentioned in the below reviews--one has no choice but to throw it down after just a few chapters."
1,i have not yet received this item,i have not received this item. Please send item soon. If not let me know you are not able to.
1,IS IT A MOVIE?,"I'm sorry, but this film, as you say, stinks. God, I only wanted to watch it because it is based on a Dean Koontz novel. Well, now I'm reluctant of reading the novel. The film is tooooo boring, it gets anywhere. Although the film stars the good acting of Jeff Goldblum, it is balanced with the nauseate and hot Alicia Silverstone and other bad actors. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.AND MONEY"
4,Not as bad as other's are saying it is,"If you can mix the movies of ""Dead Zone"", ""Pet Cemetery"", ""Copy Cat"" and ""Ghost"" you have this one. It is a little different take on the ""after"" life and death experience and what comes of it. It is not bad for it's age and the story does at times take on an ""unbelievable"" turn at times, but all in all it isn't that bad. The cast is a very strong cast and it is well acted. I am one for B movies and this is much better than a B movie. See it for yourself. I liked it. I recommend this movie to anyone that likes a little of the ""unbelievable"" mixed with a thriller all in one."
3,Hideaway,"Better than what I was expecting, Goldblum is always on top form no matter what the movie. This film is severly creepy, although the computer effects are quite rubbish the film is saved by good acting and a heavy metal soundtrack.If your going to watch a Goldblum movie I'd reccoment the Fly, but this is always a good rental."
1,Excess Baggage,"Most of the film is painful to watch mostly because Ms Silverstone is a spoiled brat who is irritating throughout. The last quarter of the film is the most tolerable and the ending a satisfying relief after a dull previous 3/4 of the film. Standout performance by Christopher Walken as the bad guy, and even Harry Connick Jnr is passable, but the two leads are sadly mismatched and the vast majority of the film is a mishap. Poor Benico del Torro for having to star opposite the over indulged Ms Silverstone. He deserves credit (and some eye drops for those red eyes) just for staying the course."
4,Succeeding Predictability,"Solid movie. Two men come back from near-death due to a new experimental surgery. Both of them bring something back with them. God vs Satan ,ala ""Prophecy"", is the main theme and I find these tales to be entertaining. Hideaway will not knock your socks off with a an ever-twisting story arc but what it does have is a solid core plot, coupled together with above-average acting, and special effects that will move you. That last comment seems to be up for debate, some have called the effects ""hoaky"" and stated they ruined the movie. I disagree. You'll have to check it out for yourself. High recommendation."
3,Suspenseful and chilling until the cheesy ending.,This movie was a pleasant surprise finding it on the $.49 rental shelf. The story unfolds at a steady pace that builds up great suspense setting up for an ending that does not work. If the supernatural special effects had been left out or kept to minimum I would have given this movie 4 stars. The ending is just a little too fantastic. It is a movie that makes you probe the what if's of dying and being brought back to life and what the consequences may be of science interfering with that process. Jeff Goldblum gives a good performance. Definitely worth seeing once and it is much better than the Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer variety of teen horror flicks.
4,Vassago: Angels & Demons by Koontz,"This book was excellent. I LOVE Jeff Goldblum. Tragically the book and movie have little to do with one another. The book is way better. When an antique dealer and family are in an accident, on a trip back from their cabin, he dies. Fortunately a brilliant doctor can and does manage to resurrect and save him with little to no damage. But then nightmares and eerie murders haunt him and he fears he may be the person responsible until he learns his own daughter is marked to be the next victim! This strange tale is done very well, it just isn't quite the one Koontz wrote, which is tragic. The film should have followed the book verbatim and made it excellent!"
3,So bad it's good,This movie was terrible albeit entertaining. READ THE BOOK. Seriously one of the most entertaining and creepy books I've read. Dean Koontz is amazing.
1,You will have to paint the model,"I bought this item together with the German Tiger 1 Snaptite kit for my son. Both items were supposed to be molded in color but when they arrived were in the standard grey that comes with other model kits that you have to paint. I contacted the manufacturer Revell USA to get some feedback on recourse available but they have not acknowledged my complaint (I supplied photos of items, upc code and original sales receipt). I then contacted Revell Germany who responded immediately but told me that they did not manufacture the product and I would have to deal with Revell USA. I guess I will have to bite the bullet and buy a separate paint kit."
2,not overly impressed,"I wasn't overly impressed with the movie, the main character was iffy at best, there was no real chemistry between anyone. THe fight scenes were no where near the quality I would expect. And being a Lamas fan I was very disappointed that his entire role in the movie was less than 20 minutes. Not a very happy camper."
4,X-treme Fighter That Dan Mayid is great!,"I loved the story it was a new aspect showing different martial artists. Brad played by Dan Mayid, is awesome. His techniques look outstanding. I hope he makes more movies! I think he's gonna be the new Karate Kid! Can't wait for x-treme fighter 2"
3,Good book but a bit esoteric,"This book is a must read for anyone that fancies themself a scientist and is interested in the subject of bicycling.However, it is a bit dry and boring for others. As an engineer I found it interesting and informative."
4,Physics for Cyclists,"Excellent book on the physics and technology of cycling with very detailed chapters covering everything from frame materials and design to aerodynamics. Material is dated in some areas due to the age of the research, such as in frame materials. Still a good book for those that want to know the whys behind bicycling."
3,A cornucopia of scientific information,"This is a great book mainly because it is the only one of its kind. It covers many aspects of the science of pedal power.I find that the data supporting some of the experiments, and the conclusions from that data, could use some more flesh. For example, I'm still not entirely sure why a larger diameter wheel has less rolling resistance, but the data supports that conclusion.I agree with other readers that the book could use an update."
4,"Great music, okay performances","Mozart is absolutely my favorite composer, and if you have never listened to him, one of these ""Greatest Hits"" type CD's is a must buy. Great for kids or adults who want to start listening to classical music; the album contains many famous works. You'll be surprised at the melodies you recognize! However, this CD is not for the extensive and detailed classical music listener as the performances are not all that great. However, even average performances don't detract from this great music."
5,Gotta love crayons!,"My daughter goes through crayons faster than anything else, so I decided to buy her a big box. I'm quite happy with the variety of colors. I think I'll continue to buy this kind from now on!"
3,Not 120 different colored crayons like the picture suggests,"I ordered this for an art project my daughter wanted to do. I thought, looking at the picture of the box, that this would be 120 different colored crayons. It is not. It is a set of 2 sets of 48 and one set of 24. I ordered two sets so I am very disappointed. Delivery of the purchase was good."
5,"I feel a little ripped off, but it's cool","Who doesn't like crayons? And by far Crayola has the best crayons. So i just want to say, awesome crayons. However, I feel a little dupped upon opening the box as I found two 48 count and one 24 count and a crayon sharpener and I was like, if I wanted three boxes of crayons, I would have just bought them instead! However upon looking inside like another reviewer, I noticed they were different colors. I wish though it was in one box like the 96 count though. I am grateful as I colored with my two little sisters but if it was my own, I wouldn't be so happy."
4,crayola crayons 120 count,I just bought the same product from an office supply store for $7.99I was quite pleased with the product for that price....
5,Crayon Box Success,"What can I say about a box of crayons? Crayola is reliably the best, I think. They worked great on the wonderful project I did which I found on the net. They also melt well to drip hot crayon onto things."
5,Crayola 120ct,"I love this product, of course Crayola is the best! I love all colors in there! It is going to take me a while to use them all! Of course they don't smell as good as back in the day and some of the colors don't seem as thick and rich on the paper, but it is still the best you can find and I know I know I will enjoy my ""relaxing"" coloring and the fun coloring that I will have with my cousins for a long time. Of course they have to be extra careful, I don't want my good crayons being destroyed! I recommend this product to anyone with kids, or is a kid a heart! You will love these!"
5,Crayola 120 Ct. Origianl Crayon,I got this for myself & it is amazing how much some colors have changed over the years. What they use to have & what they are now. Love it.
2,Crayola crayons supposedly 120 count,"Very disappointed in this purchase to say the least. When I ordered I assumed it was a box of 120 different colored crayons. Instead I received two of the same boxes of 60 count crayons. Of which one box received with every single crayon broken in multiple pieces the other box was fine (received in same package). Which leads me to believe they were sent broken, I don't think it happened I'm delivery process. Needless to say I wouldn't recommend buying these, they were misleading about what I was receiving and couldn't even use 60 of the crayons."
3,WEBSTERS NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY,"To the seller... I'm looking specifically for the 1947 publication and also any earlier than this date. I'm more specifically looking for a very old, large dictionary that I saw once that has 2 definitions of 'underdog'... 1 about lumbering and the 2nd about the political definition. Thanks... Marjorie"
5,Get this book now!!!!!!,"If you have a child with Autism Spectrum Disorder, buy this right now!! It will help you gain insight into your childs head! Dr. Szatmari actually shows you the beautiful side of the disorder, while never forgetting how difficult it can be. Excellent, excellent book!!!!!!"
4,Why tamper with greatness?!,"Where do I begin?Hobgoblins is one of my favorite ""cheesy"" movies, and of hearing about a part 2...I was more than joyed!But that joy didn't last.The movie is a sequel/remake, and although the characters are the same, they are drastically different.To be honest, the movie has it's moments...but it seems like it tried to hard.The DVD has a short documentary in which director Rick Sloane explains the process of making the sequel.Very insightful, and honest!Sloane explains how he had to fire the first crew, and how an uncoperative extra had to be replaced!All in all the film doesn't live up to the original, but as I stated earlier, it has it's moments.The middle of the film is when it picks up, but by the end it had lost it's steam again.The most memorable character would probubly be ""NICK""very comical, and entertaining!Definetely worth checking out, not as cool and campy as the original....but still fun!"
3,"Not very ""CuddleSoft""","Maybe I'm just picky, but I didn't find this pillow to be very soft at all.I originally got two Pacific Coast down pillows about a year ago. At first, I found them quite soft, without much support, but over time I got used to them, and now love them, and get a better sleep.So I decided to buy this pillow, thinking it would be the same. It wasn't. It is firm, but it's not very cuddly at all, or comfortable. I've decided to return it, and instead try for the ""upgraded"" (at least in price) Pacific Coast down body pillow, which seems to be the exact same specifications as my current two standard sized pillows, only in body pillow size."
3,Only of interest for hardcore fans,"""Colossus"" is Scorn's strangest and least accessible album. The drum sound is sharper, the guitars are more dissonant, and the voices are more distorted than on any other Scorn album. With its' claustrophobic and threatening atmosphere this record may be the soundtrack for the Apocalypse, but it often sounds a little forced. N.J.Bullen isn't a very good guitarist and can't be compared with Goldflesh's Justin Broadrick, who was featured on the previous album ""Vae Solis"". The best track on ""Colossus"" is ""White Irises Blind"", which appears on the EP collection of the same name. If you are a new Scorn fan, i recommend you to buy ""W.I.B."", because it gives you a good overview of Scorn's earlier work. But ""Colossus"" is not a necessity unless you have to own Scorn's full backcatalogue."
2,Price is to high!,This streaming cost $39.99 and you can buy the bluray box set for $25.00? This pricing doesn't make sense and what's the incentive to purchase streaming when you can have the actually discs for way cheaper? I love this show though!
3,I'm surprised that most people haven't noted a decline in quality starting in Season 4,Seasons 1-3 merited 5 starsThe Season 4 storylines are much less good than those of Seasons 1-3.
1,It can't be played on ps3,"The 1 star is not for the show, that is awesome, best sitcom ever. The problem is that this blu ray doesn't work on ps3. I only can play the first disc, the other two was impossible."
3,Its still a problem watch in PS3,"I bought this blue ray knowing that in the first generation of PS3 didnt work well, and was really hard to reproduce in the PS3.I find solutions but some of them works, but not everytime...I really love the show, and for me its OK, the quality its really good and the extras of the season are Ok."
4,As Described,The packing was adequate and the DVDs are just as described. Would do business with again. Thank you for making Christmas shopping enjoyable and easy!
5,Still great...,"I was late to the HIMYM party, but am glad I relented and started watching it. The 4th season may not be my favorite, that would have to be the 3rd, but it was strong throughout. My personal favorite was the ""Naked Man"" episode. Great fun - buy it, you won't be disappointed."
1,Great but don't buy on Blu-ray,"There's been a problem with the Blu-ray version of HIMYM so I would suggest not to buy it unless you have Sony Blu-Ray player that is not a PS3. There's been numerous blogs, articles, etc about how the Blu-Ray doesn't work on PS3's so just google it. Not worth the time of trying to manipulate the Blu-ray to allow it to get past the FBI Warning. Just buy on DVD."
1,Doesn't play on PS3,"How can they make a BluRay disc that refuses to work in a PS3 (slim)? Is it some overbearing new copy protection scheme? Something else? I thought these things were supposed to be universally playable, but apparently not. I can't get this to play on a PS3, one of the most popular blu ray players out there. Read around and you will see other people have had the exact same problem. It's been a know issue for months and still no one has fixed it. Wish I could get my money back and buy the DVD instead. Great TV show but avoid it on Blu Ray or you won't be watching it!!!"
4,Set is as expected,"Nothing wrong with the quality of the set physically, exactly as one expects from a series box these days. It is nice that it is Blu-Ray. An enjoyable season, but that is less objective than the actual item condition."
5,Season four,"We are very happy with our purchase of How I Met Your Mother, Season Four Blu-ray. It's a 3 disc set and we feel it is well worth the price. It arrived in a very timely manner and in great shape. Would definetly recommend."
5,Hiiilarious,This show is just freakin' hilarious! The interaction and relationship between all the characters will make you laugh out loud!
5,HIMYM is back,"Season 4 was a great addition to the series. If you are not a fan of the show I would recommend watching all previous episodes before this season because the writers have taken this show to a level past the sitcom. They place high value on character development and the story line just keeps getting better and better. I honestly don't even care who the mother is anymore, I just care about Ted, Marshall, Barney, Robin and Lily."
4,"dvd good, show not as good","DVD music cheesy and different from theme song. Otherwise, no issues from DVD. The show has become watered down (probably by network execs) as compared to season 1."
1,Defective discs,"DON'T BUY THIS.I got this with the intention of watching it on a PS3. Discs 2 and 3 worked perfectly, but disc 1 was just a non-starter. It got to the screen that said that the Blu-Ray was manufactured to the most recent standards blah blah and then went back to the PS3 home screen.I got a replacement from Amazon and it's exactly the same! Discs 2 and 3 work, disc 1 kicks back to the PS3 home screen before it even gets to the anti-piracy warning. Don't buy this! It's a great show, but get the DVD."
2,Not as good as prior seasons,"Having been a fan of prior seasons I was very disappointed in season 4 - the story lines were not very good and the jokes were sometimes painfully bad - I'm hoping for a better season 5. In addition the premise of a future Ted telling the story is getting very old and irritating. Barney didn't even say ""Suit up!"" for the entire season plus he's become a whiny joke - they need to improve the quality of the show or I'll no longer be watching - plus Ted is an even bigger sad sack than before."
3,"Good show, awful shipment","I ordered season how i met your mother season 4 on July 5. I was supposed to get it between July 6 and 11. I didn't get it until about July 23. I guess they put the package in the wrong truck. It was coming from West Virginia to North Carolina. When I checked the tracking on it, it was in Washington State."
1,worst show ever in the history of television!,i hate this show. every person is a horribleactor & watching this is liking the soundof fingernails on a chalkboard. shows likenorm & til' death get cancelled while thisgarbage [nasty] show gets to stay on the air.it shows the lack of depth of people todaythat they think this is funny! watch thebig bang theroy or classic shows like theodd couple or barney miller for real laughs!
5,Legen...wait for it!,Not much to review. Quicker than expected delivery a plus. And a great season of HIMYM.
2,"Great show, doesn't work on PS3","I love HIMYM, and season 4 was a a good season (not as good as the first 3 but worth every minute). The 2 star review is because these blu rays do not work on ps3s, or at least the older ones. So if that is your primary blu ray player, avoid these until the issue is resolved!!"
3,"Great show, but not friendly with 1st generation ps3",Disc one does not work with the original ps3. I've had tried 2 different copies. Lots of people are having the same issue. Beware!
4,How I Met Your Mother Season 4,"This what exactly what I wanted, I was very pleased at ow fast it arrived to me. I would recommend this if you like the show."
4,"Great rock, but overlooked","If you ever have a chance to see this band live, make sure you do it. They are tremendously talented and still sound like they did 20 years ago. It's always a thrill when I catch them on the radio or hear their music being played at ballgames or someplace like that. Get this CD if you don't have it already."
4,Lambdin keeps on ticking,"Alan Lewrie, in these escapades further cements Dewey Lambdin's reputation as supplanting C. S. Forrester and the classic Horatio Hornblower series. Why? Lewrie, in addition to all the Hornblower qualities we so admire, has an irrepressible, and irresistible, dog which lurks just below the surface of his generally sterling character. Well done!"
2,Thirty one blank pages,The French Admiral (Alan Lewrie Naval Adventures)My sister and I bought nine of the Alan Lewrie Naval Adventure books for my husband for his birthday. Eight books arrived weeks before the infamous first book- The French Admiral. So it was frustrating when my husband began that first book of the series - 443 pages and thirty one pages were blank. Not extra pages of white paper but missing pages of the narrative. And not until he was deep into the story did the blanks turn up. page 393 and 394 missing and then 29 more missing pages.
5,good kids cup - a bit heavier than we expected,"We also moved from plastic to these cups for our children (ages 3 and 4). They are working great and the kids love them. When they first arrived I thought the kids might reject them because they are a bit heavy, but that hasn't been a problem. And I like that they feel sturdy. Also, we bought all blue and it is a very nice dark blue color, but I'm not sure I'd call it ""cobalt""? Overall I would highly recommend them."
5,Get This Hard Drive!,This is a very good hard drive. It is whisper quiet. I have never had a single problem. I disagree with the other review who said you couldn't turn this hard drive off. You push in on the power button and hold it a couple of seconds and it goes off. You will not be dissapointed with this Hard Drive!!
3,Good,I like the illustrations and my mom says that these books are good advise on how to act. I'm sad that this is my older sisters kindle because if it were mine I would download all the books. I'm only six so 1 I don't know how to read fluently so my sister is typing this.
4,Funny Book,"This was a perfect book for my 7 & 4 year old because my son likes the theme of ""No Girls Allowed"" and my daughter likes club exclusivity so they both got a laugh from this story. Simple and enjoyable read."
4,The Berenstain Bears No Girls Allowed,I enjoy reading this book very much. I like reading Bernstain Bear books. i think childred whould enjoy someone reading this book to them at age 4 and i think the childred will read this book by them self at age 5-7. the part i like is when the boys build themself a club house.
4,A Cherished Grindcore album!,"This was one of my favorites by Napalm Death..Utopia Banished features a whirlwind of excellent drumming and the guitar work is very tight,this album was one of the major improvements that they needed.When they first started out they were just messing around and not progressing as musicians.This album and many others by ND showcase a highly talented band."
3,cat nip ball,The ball is a little hard and the cat does not play with it as much as others that she has.
3,just balls,These are decent cat toys. They were purchased as fillers so I could get free shipping. My cat played with them for awhile but lost interest over time. Then my dog ate them LOL. overall worth it.
1,A waste od money,Our cat usually likes these things when we toss them to her she just looks at them and walks away.
3,"good movies, quality not any better","we really love all of his movies, so we already had the DVD's but we just got a blueray player so I thought I would surprise my husband with the Blue ray versions. I have only watched the Jay and silent bob strikes back, but I swear, the quality seems WORSE than the regular DVD version. The colors seem off, and it is more pixelated, or blurry. Anyway, disappointed in the quality. Granted, you are probably not going to watch these movies for the picture quality anyway, so save money and buy regular dvd versions."
1,English Only?,"English language audio only and NO SUBTITLES (or English-only subs)?Is that correct? That's the present product description, so if correct I give 1 star.I understand not dubbing movies into other languages (I always prefer original language), but studios are just cheap and stupid not to include subtitles in several languages, especially on Blu Ray editions.EDIT: details from a Review website; Spanish only on the first two and French only on the third (for alternative languages), so as a box set anyone interested in those languages is getting cheated.CLERKS: 1080p HD, Aspect ratio 1.85:1, Audio tracks (English 5.1 DTS-HD MA), Subtitles (English SDH, Spanish)CHASING AMY: 1080p HD, Aspect ratio 1.85:1, Audio tracks (English 5.1 DTS-HD MA, Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital), Subtitles (English SDH, Spanish)JAY & SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK: 1080p HD, Aspect ratio 2.35:1, Audio tracks (English 5.1 Uncompressed, English/French 5.1 Dolby Digital), Subtitles (English SDH, French)"
3,"Not Just ""Flax Seed Oil"" - also contains: other oil, extract, tocopherols, acids, soy derivative","Originally purchased for seasoning cast iron cookware -- but after receiving it and reading the ingredients on the bottle, the oil is not pure enough for that purpose.A simple listing of the ingredients for this health food supplement in the product description at Amazon would have been preferable, and appreciated.Live and learn. (After having paid extra to overnight it to help assure the oil would not go rancid in transit, too.)--------------NOW Foods Certified Organic Flax Seed OilIngredients:Organic Flax Seed Oil (cold-pressed, unrefined and Non-GE) and a natural antioxidant blend of Organic Sunflower Oil, Organic Rosemary Extract, Natural Mixed Tocopherols, Ascorbic Acid and Citric Acid. Contains soy derivative.--------------"
3,pay attention,"Pay your attn at ingredient of this product:Organic Flax Seed Oil(cold-pressed,unrefined and Non-GE)and a natural antioxidant blend of Organic Rosemary Extract,Natural Mixed Tocopferols,Ascorbyl Palmitate and Citric Acid.Contains soy derivative. No allergy reaction?"
2,Not pure flax seed oil,"The impression given in all the details on the product page indicates that this is pure flax seed oil. In fact, it contains a number of oils, and while flax seed is said to be the main ingredient, those other oils are not what I was intending to pay for. In fact, for my purposes, the alleged anti-oxidant effects of the other oils get in the way with what I purchased this oil for (cast iron seasoning). I didn't realize this until after I opened the package, otherwise I would have returned it."
1,rotten oil,"I take flax seed oil, and when the local supermarket stopped selling it, I was happy to find it on Amazon. But I find this brand of oil gives me bad gas when I take it, which I believe is due to the oil being bad. I bought two bottles which I don't know what I am going to do with, hate to throw them away."
2,You're not getting what you think you are,"This is the second time purchasing this product. Figured it was a good price, so bought it again. I am so very disapointed. Yes organic, but NOT pure flaxseed oil. The web site does not list all the ingredients. Look on the label.... I am alergic to soy!!! I figured it was just the change in season, reason for not feeling right. It's the SOY!!! I am returning this product. Please list all the ingredients that are contained in your product, so that others will not have similar fate, as I."
3,Not pure flax,"Misleading, because it's not pure flax. Once I received it I was disappointed but I thought ""hey, maybe it'll taste delicious with the sunflower oil, rosemary extract and all that..."" but no, it's bitter and not enjoyable at all."
3,Good for you but.....,"I ordered this because Flax Seed Oil was recommended by several nutrition books I read. No one warned me how bad it tasted! However, I will grin and bear. The bottle came in good condition and was full. Oragnic. As advertised."
1,"Flax Seed Oil ""Bitter""","Apparently this flax seed oil was not kept under refrigeration at some point. A real no, no for flax seed. It is still within the expiration date but unfit to use because it is quite bitter. Because of heavy weight & cost to ship back, didn't send it back. A total loss."
2,Healthy must taste nasty...,"I heard great things about this product which I still continue to believe. But I also heard a recommendation to put it into your protein shake, NO! Horrible idea! This stuff tastes DISGUSTING in anything! I believe it's healthy, but I have to take it like a shot with a tablespoon like medication."
3,BAD POURING SPOUT,"Kinda annoyed that this bottle is so hard to pour. It has a huge 1"" plus opening. Unlike other bottles with a small 1/5"" spout. The first few times it came out in huge quantities. Also it still makes a mess when I pour a small amount because it drips down the side.I won't buy this brand again just because of the spout."
3,NOW Foods Flax Seed Oil,I'm not sure how to rate this oil because I don't know if it's working or not. How could one tell? So... I'm giving it three stars. It is quite expensive on Amazon. After purchasing it here I found it cheaper on Overstock.
1,The worst DVD I have ever watched,"This DVD is a waste of time, I am glad I only rented it and didn't buy it. It has no performances of Mariah Carey. There is one interview done by a foreign interviewer who can barely speak English. The interview is in black and white and is placed inside an animated screen about 1/3 of your TV Screen. The rest is close up shots of some English people giving their opinions about Mariah's career. The little time they actually show Mariah is the same shot over and over, I don't think they had any permission to use actual photos or video of Mariah. Don't waste your time out of the whole DVD maybe 10 min, outside of the interview, do you actually see any image of Mariah Carey. If you like to look at a bunch of people telling you everything you already know about Mariah Carey then good luck, otherwise steer clear!"
4,a solid album,"The bcc might have fallen off a few years ago, however over the last few years, they have really came back strong. It is extremely unfortunate, that these are the ones not getting any attention. Unlike all of these other cheeseballs that disappear and return with garbage, you can always expect a solid album out of any of the bcc camp. Overall, the albums production is great, lyrics are always on point, just the same smiff n wesson, stuck in the messed up world of hip hop 05, intead of the early 90s. If your looking for something that you can drive in get bent in, do anything to, get this. If you are craving some hip hop music at its finest, tired of listening to the ""real hip hop"" (common,kanye,and whoever) that is so media fabricated, grab this one.. peace"
3,"GOOD,BUT NOT GREAT","THIS IS A GOOD ALBUM FOR ALL YOU BOOT CAMP HEADS OUT THERE,ACORDING TO ME IT HAS NOTHING ON THE FIRST TWO ALBUMS THEY MADE."
5,Must Have!,"If you plan to visit the beaches of Flordia, this book is a must! We enjoy looking through the book after a day of shelling to see what ""treasures"" we found. Great photos so you can easily match your shells to them."
5,Collecting seashells in the state of Florida,"This book has beautiful full color photos of seashells which can befound in the state of Florida. The descriptions of the shells areexcellent and if you are a collector, you will gain a lot of knowledgefrom reading this book. Whether you are a native of Florida or a snowbird,you will start to recognize the pictured shells as you explore the sandybeaches on your own. A very enjoyable book for anyone interested in sea-shells."
3,Not what I expected,"This is written in a more story-telling way. THe graphics weren't as professional as I had hoped, but overall it was/is still a decent book for Shelling information."
2,Seashell Book,"I ordered this book on September 13, 2010. I received an email stating the book was shipped via USPS on September 15, 2010, WITHOUT any tracking capability. As of today October 14, 2010, I have not received the book. I had to wait until yesterday to receive a credit. My advice for future purchases is to only order from sellers who ship with tracking, thereby making it much easier for the sellers and the buyers to see what has happened to a shipment."
5,Secrets of a Civil War Submarine: Solving the Mysteries Of The H.L. Hunley,Excellant book. My son really enjoyed it.
2,Boring Book reviewed by Kell,"Do you like a book with lots of excitement and adventure? Then Secrets of a Civil War Submarine is not for you. Secrets of a Civil War Submarine is an informational book about one of the first submarines, The Hunley, and it shows you how the ship works, all of the crew members, and all of the boring missions. Maybe it sounds interesting to you, but to me it is very boring. The only thing that won't keep you from falling asleep is the part where you figure out why the submarine sank. At the end it shows you what they think the crew looks like, and artifacts that were found, and the secrets that the captain kept. If this sounds like the book for you then read it. But I do not like this book, and I do not recommend it."
3,BLACKS EAGLE NEARLY SAME AS STONE HAND!!!!!,"This is the second book in this series about Jason Coles. I could not believe how much it is like the first one, ""Stone Hand."" In this one Jason Coles has quite being a scout and settled down to raising horses. He comes back to his cabin to find his Indian wife killed and his adopted son carried off. Remember this is the same son that was carried off in ""Stone Hand"". He of course goes after the ones who did it and they are led by ""Black Eagle."" The story line is about Jason going back to the army as a scout. Will not tell you the ending because you may read the book. I just got tired of the same little boy being carried off, brought back and carried off again. Maybe West can come up with a different story line in his next book."
1,Price,"I find it hard to believe that the cost of this book, and the other series cost...wow I can not believe anyone in his right mind would pay these prices for used books or even a new book...paper back..yes I would love to purchase this series, but at these prices I will Read johnstones books at a very reasonable cost....wow I get upset just thinking about your prices."
5,Culinary Artist,"This book was for inspiration, and that is exactly what it is doing for everybody at my workplace from front of house to back of house!"
4,"This reference is the ""Color Wheel"" of food.","Painters have the color wheel to identify what colors match others. Now chefs, and lovers of food everywhere, have one too.""Culinary Artistry"" is not a ""cookbook."" Rather, it is a culinary chemistry textbook. Hundreds of pages are dedicated to the ""Food matches made in heaven."" That is to say, what food goes with what food/herb/spice.Anyone who loves cooking will love it even more with the wealth of knowledge that this book imparts to the reader. It will take every aspiring chef, or home cook to a higher level.No matter how many ""cookbooks"" you have, ""Culinary Artistry"" is an invaluable reference in your cooking library!"
3,"Disappointing design, Difficult to Use","I liked the opening comments on art, although I felt that the practical content was a bit obvious. My biggest complaint is that the book has rough uncut irregular edges making it impossible to flip through the pages, in desperation I cut a quarter inch off with my band saw. Additionally the cover flaps fold open, so I cut them off as well. Should have returned the book but I'm too lazy to do so. It feels like they tried to be too ""artistic"" with the book design. A great subject that could be taken to a much higher level."
5,CULINARY ARTISTRY,"I almost returned this...I admit that I was looking for a book that would help me decorate food on a plate and since I already knew the author that this was it. WRONG! But, when I started looking through this book, I was noticing that it had foods that pair up with other herbs and spices, along with foods that should be cooked in which season, menu planning and such, I decided to keep it.I think its a well worth book if you want more culinary knowledge. I am beginning my personal chef business and this will certainly help me and I am sure it will you too."
5,Fantastic Resource for Menu and Entree Planning,"This is truly a unique book, since it deals with putting together creative menus by giving first of all the ideas of prominent chefs. Second, and what I find this work truly uselful and unique for is a listing by ingredient with its pairing with other ingredients, spices, herbs, fruits, nuts, etc.This book is getting well-worn and will be for the serious, cretive cook who wants to start coming up with some of their own creations."
3,art is more than food chemistry,"A picture is worth a thousand words, as for this book it lacks pictures showing the artistic presentation of the finished culinary delights. Presentation of a five star culinary masterpiece is in my opinion part of food artistry. The biggest picture you have of any dish nearing tasteful completion is the cover. Keep the book for the tables or black and white information."
3,Where's the color?,"I bought this as a gift for my 20-year-old granddaughter at her request. You would think a book designed specifically to teach the ""artistry"" of presenting food would be in color -- at least some of it. I think she was a little disappointed as well but would never say so. Maybe I'm asking too much from a $20 book - I would have gladly spent more to get her something that would be more helpful -- as they say, a picture is worth a 1000 words -- and some pictures just gotta be in color."
2,Culinary Artistry,"Culinary Artistry came up with a 4.5 star rating in a search pattern for ""Garnishing"". The book is more concerned with matching of flavours - flavours, spices, herbs and foods that go together. In a roundabout way this does have relevance to garnishing. Culinary Artistry is overly engrosed in listing individual chefs favorite ingedients and methods of cooking that I felt was irrelevant and did not in its presented format convey enough information i.e more recipes."
2,Not very useful for the accomplished cook,I bought this to get more info and ideas for plating and presentation. I was not very impressed.
5,Can't live without,"If the experience of an entire career can be written down, then Culinary Artistry is it! The heart of the book is the ingredient match tables, but there is so much more. Only one reading is not enough. Consider it a workbook and have your pencil or post-its ready. Each reading, something else pops out and improves my cooking!"
4,Culinary school in a book,This book is not a cookbook. Rather it's an intro into how to become a food artisan. I pull it down from the shelf whenever I need some inspiration to create new dishes from whatever is at hand. It's the kind of book that encapsulates much of the recipe design thought process as taught in some culinary institutes. I think it's a good book for the person who's ready to go beyond recipe duplication and enter the realm of becoming more creative in the kitchen.
2,Not a useful source,"As I culinary student, I bought this book looking for some inspiration as well as instruction. The book begins by showing how it is impossible to learn how to be a culinary artist, that it is a gift. Interspersed are some rules as well as flavor references that left a lot to be desired. The rest includes anecdotes of different dishes that chefs had created. Chefs described their rules for creating art as food, which most focused on using classic flavor combination while denigrating non-authentic or fusion cuisine. Usually these stories showed how the chefs broke their own rules. The book did not flow very well. I was hoping for a textbook or guide, but it was more like reading a bunch of magazine features on different chefs."
5,A Christmas Gift,It was a gift for son. He works in a restaurant. He used to work on a ship in navy. Cooking is what he loved to do. And this book helps with that.Thank You.
3,difficult for people to read due to many typos.,"It's very difficult to read considering they have typos like crazy. They reference Italian fish by the wrong name, so you're really getting a lot of misinformation. Overall, the title is misleading. It's more a series of small interviews and insights into some professional chefs, with a general theme that runs throughout the pages that ""less is more."" There are a few ideas on how some of the chefs construct their menus, and ingredients that go together."
3,Good reference book,This book is not well written and uses a lot of quotes. Although the reference parts of the book is great don't expect to get a lot out of the first few written chapters.
2,sports,"After having worn out an album and a cassette, I eagerly looked forward to replacing some of my favorite music with a medium with a longer usable life. When the CD finally arrived I hurried to my CD player to listen to a ""clean-clear-digital"" copy of the best rock and roll ever. Imagine my disappointment as I listened to ""The Heart of Rock and Roll."" How pathetic! The vocals were severely out of tune, the beat did not blend with the music. It was like listening to a very bad amateur trying to squawk one of the worst versions of that song I have ever heard. Who ever digitally remastered this song, ought to be digitally eliminated. Hanging is too good for them. Heuy Lewis fans rise up! Sing your indignation to the heavens. We have been betrayed."
5,A must-have classic!,"Just look at these songs and you'd understand why it was the #1 album on the Billboard charts for ~4 weeks and nominated for Album of the Year grammy. Six out of the nine songs here were hit singles! If you were alive and paying attention in 1983-84, you'd know tracks 1,2,4, & 7. ""Bad is Bad"" is another classic, ""Walkin' on a Thin Line"" is a great rocker about the Vietnam Vets, and ""You Crack Me Up"" is just all out fun. This album is a classic... period."
4,Best Huey Lewis album,Best Huey Lewis album ever. Have always liked it since I was young. Has the best stuff Huey & the News has ever done. This is their greatest hits album.
5,THE Blockbuster Hit..,"Huey Lewis & the News needed a BIG hit after only moderate success from ""Picture This"" (scoring a Top Ten hit with ""Do You Believe In Love?""). Their prayers were answered with ""Sports."" Released in the closing months of 1983, the record was instantly a HUGE success, receaching blockbuster status. It peaked at #1, sold over ten million copies, and spent over a year in the Top Ten. Quite a feat! The record's success was attributed from it's five hit singles (including the Top Ten hits ""I Want A New Drug"" and ""The Heart of Rock & Roll""), the appeal of the band's tongue-in-cheek music videos, and their nice-guy attitude towards their MANY fans. The album turned out to be one of the highest selling records of the 1980s. VERY fun and enjoyable album! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
4,Shipped Defective CD,The CD was scratched on top. Track 4 skips. AMAZON WILL NOT LET YOU RETURN OPEN ITEMS! EVEN FOR EXCHANGE! CATCH 22!! YOU LOSE!
2,I guess you can't go back...,"Okay maybe this was cool back in the day when I was like four, but I just listened to it today and it's so awful! All the dated synths and monotonous drum machines and the ""dwee-doos"" of ""I Want A New Drug"", not to mention Mr Lewis' annoying vocal style. Even the #1 hit ""Heart of Rock n Roll"" is one of the worst songs about rock celebrating itself. It sounds just like Michael Jackson and Phil Collins, which is not a good thing."
5,The best of 80's music is here!,"Flashback, mid 80's, punk bands are taking over and then all the sudden here is Huey Lewis giving us what we really need: Some great rock and roll!!! I seriously recommend this album to anybody who grew up in the 80's, you'd be surprised how you still like it! This album has all the greats: Heart of Rock & Roll, Heart and Soul (my fav), A New Drug, etc... So take a load off, get the CD and listen to some great music-LC"
5,Huey Lewis,"Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83,I think they really came into their own, commercial and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far much more bitter, cynical sense of humour."
2,A five star album turned into a two star piece of rubbish!,"At least one other reviewer hit the nail right on the head with his ""two star"" review of SPORTS (Remastered/Expanded Edition). If you can imagine taking your 5-band EQ and turning the treble end all the way down and the bass end all the way up, that's what you're getting on this CD. To quote Huey, ""sometimes bad is bad,"" but this is one case where bad is pure garbage.I just put my original vinyl copy of Sports on the turntable, and it sounds fantastic! If you need this on CD, look for the earlier edition."
2,Remastered? You cannot be serious!,"To think I sold my old cd to get the ""better"" sounding ""remastered"" version with extra tracks! 2 stars because even without the bonus tracks which in this case doesn't help the cd at all, this is actually quite a good album; I also got the cassette when this came out and quite frankly, even the cassette sounded better than this!The sound quality is very, very poor so I'd recommend if you haven't already got this, to wait for another better remastered version or even get the original untouched cd if you can still find it as there is really no noticeable difference. Perhaps if there is a well produced ""Best of"" compilation, that may be a good idea to get too especially to get ""Do You Believe In Love"" as well which I still think is their greatest hit ever. I wonder if I can sell this cd too. Hmm......"
4,"Good, basic selection of pieces, mostly by Johann Strauss Jr.","Unlike the earlier reviewer, I have heard this CD (and still own it). It's a fairly basic compilation, featuring 10 works of Johann Strauss Jr., as well as the ""Radetzky March"" by Johann Strauss Sr. The performances, to my untrained ear, are all well done; this was one of my favorite CDs to listen to while working, back when I was able to do so. I'm particularly fond of ""On the Beautiful Blue Danube"" (like almost everyone who's likely to read this review) and the aptly-titled ""Perpetual Motion. A Musical Joke"". Classical enthusiasts may be able to recommend a better introduction to the Johann Strauss family (and I'd be grateful for any such recommendations), but for most of us, this CD will serve that purpose just fine."
1,Poor movie,"As I watched this movie I was wondering, what is the purpose behind this movie. Its not scary. The main character a young blond girl just acts weird. The anti-climactic end does nothing make me wonder why I even bought this DVD. Dont waste your money. The cover of the DVD slip case is better than the movie"
1,I't wouldn't've HURT to have a script written by an adult,"This movie is utter garbage. You've been warned. The kooky plot twist was completely implausible... a girl who's father had actually had an entire other family (bigamizing, don'tcha know) on the side and whose mother was an abusive turd gets even by tryina kill alla the memberz of this other family once the turdbrain mother kills the bigamizing father by smashing into him with her car and stuff, knocking the girl's teeth right outta her head and such. So the girl goes around in this junkyard out in the Arizona desert, stirring up lots of bad noise and bla bla bla bla bla. Complete trash. Oh, and my review contained spoilers... if it were possible to spoil such a rancid piece of drek any further."
3,intriguing non-thrilling thriller,the blurb on the cover made this sound scary - but it turned out to be such a low-key thriller that i may not need to take my high blood pressure pills this weekendthe story moves as fast as a sand dune - character studies were the order of the dayi was engrossed -these people's interactions were intriguing - and the acting was pretty goodthe two suspicious ones were played by the only two actors i recognized - the brother was played by the crooked nosed William Mapother of LOST - and the new foster child was played by MEDIUM's older sister Sofia Vassilieva - the latter was the most impressive of the group of actorsi predicted just about all the plot twists - but in this case - it made the film fun for me
3,Very good and very bad,"Starts off great but slowly dissolves into a jumbled mess. Genuinely unnerving and worth watching for about an hour. Then, for some reason, the movie goes in a completely different direction. It seems like the film changes directors and scripts right in the middle. Worth seeing especially if you plan to fall asleep or go out before the ending."
4,Be prepared to bite your nails to the quick,"Mute Witness is a story that at times seems confusing, but the suspense is almost unbearable. The first half of the movie is just the best and is handled like an Alfred Hitchcock thriller with excellent camera work and mood. It centers around a mute make-up artist who is assisting a film crew shooting a horror movie in a Moscow studio. While there she is witness to a brutal murder of a prostitute at the hands of some who are making a snuff movie. From that moment, suspense abounds with each frame of the movie. There is some unevenness with the script, but overlook that because you are in for one hell of a rollercoaster thrill ride. This was never in wide release and that was a real shame. Originality never looked this good!"
4,suspense,"its a great movie she cant speak and she was the witness of a murder, the suspense is spectacular!I want sell mine if anyone is interested contact me I want $5.00 is like new used once!"
3,Mute and silent on so many stakes,"This film is very light indeed in plot and content. It is centered on the chase of a mute witness in a rather dilapidated and overpiled with all kinds of props and discarded equipment cinema studio in Moscow. The chase of that mute witness by the criminals she has seen performing a snuff-video for some unidentified thug. The only originality of the film is her muteness. She saw, but she can't communicate on the phone or to the police and thus cannot explain what she has seen. And yet the main protagonists of the crime will end up dead or arrested. But no even shallow analysis of the snuff-video business in the world, and this business is not centered on Moscow which is marginal in that field. It is only one piece of the decor. So the film is rather tiresome and boring.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
4,Very Deep Self-Help Book,This book reaches into the mind of a woman and helps her to understand how past and future decisions will greatly affect her life. It's a better book than I thought it would be.
2,Not as good as later books,"I was disappointed with the content. It was not up to the same standard as ""Women Men Love, Women Men Leave""."
1,Not what you want for the money...if i could rate it half a star I would.,"I puchased this item to use as a backup to my primary gun, and It has 3 things wrong with it.1. Its size ~ way too bulky might as well go with a sub-gun with a higher capacity instead. Can't use it as a primary paintball play gun, too bulky to carry as a backup.2. Its capacity is too small ~ holds only 8. Additional magazines are only $45 dollars...are you kidding me?3. Its Price ~ for the money go with somthing that has a real air supply system with it not little CO2s, I was disappointed with the range that I could get out of it.Don't purchase this item if you are serious about playing real paintball with it. Sold mine for what I could get out of it soon after I purchased it."
4,Best Selling Country Album of 1980,"Rogers was such a hot item at the time of this release, he could've sung the phone book and it would sold big. Not only was this the number 1 country album of 1980, his previous release (The Gambler) still registered at number 3. Some his songs here revisted old themes. ""In and Out of My Heart"" is reminiscent of ""Just Checked in...."" and ""One Man's Woman"" is strikingly similar to ""Daytime Friends and Nighttime Lovers."" Rogers had perfected his airy vocals that helped bring emotion to any song. It played well at the time to live audiences too, as Rogers sold out throughout the nation on tours. This is a very difficult CD to find. I ended up playing my LP (that I still had!) through my computer to convert it to today's technology. This is one that should be remastered and put out there again. Razor and Tie put it out in 1994 but available copies are few and far between."
4,Great Toe Tapping Music,I feel Kenny was his best work. I purchased his casette back in 1979. I play his casette until it broke. when I saw it for sale on amazon. I grabbed it. It brings back alot of good memories.
5,One of the best books about this horrible crime,I read this book about 10 years ago. I started to read it one night while my husband was at work and my kids were asleep. While reading the part about the actual murders being committed I felt like the author put the reader right there in the room while it was all happening. It scared the heck out of me. I had to put the book down at one point and walk around the house and make sure all the doors and windows were shut tight and locked. Definitely a page turner. I personally think this book is better than Helter Skelter. If someone wants to read a more in-depth account on Sharon Tate I highly recommend this book.
1,"sleazy, empty rehash of a sad story","Vacant Sharon Tate remains unknowable in this clip-job of a biography -- that's really more of a gruesome rehash of the Manson murders than a biography of Tate. Tate is the excuse for King to recount the killings in gory detail. Alas, Tate has been exploited even after death. Icky!"
2,Great Reference for a Manson buff,"Great reference for many a Manson book but relies heavily on Helter Skelter and introduces little new info that hasn't been published, I think author had a total of 50 pages that weren't made up of referenced material... the same old same old, not enough original material and didn't take certain questions further than he could have. This book raises a lot of questions but then doesn't follow through with a more thourogh inspection. I felt like I was jumping around Internet pages than reading a story Also the copy that I received had a miss matched index (chapter 28's refernce was really chapter 27's?), very confusing."
1,Absolute horse manure,"I can't say what I really think or Amazon won't post it. If you think you have any sympathy whatsoever for Sharon Tate and her friends and family, then take a look at the police such a thing shares your feelings, and then also tell me why you would read it. Not only that, but of course apart from the forensic evidence and police eyewitness testimony from the crime scene, we have NO IDEA what happened that night. Why? Because we only have the word of the murderers, and I am not about to believe a thing they tell anyone, even if it's at their own expense. The book is slime, and any pretense to legitimacy is shattered my the mere inclusion of that single photo (as well as the one of Sebring). Shame on King, and shame on anyone who gives it more than one star."
5,One thing left out,"I could not put this book down...It was a GREAT read. Although in the book it states that manson had a son, however he never makes reference to him again. What happened to this son, is he alive? does he have a relationship with C. Manson?? I cant understand why this is left out. G.King makes reference to a specific family members childern, however just not mansons.Even still GREAT BOOK"
4,Wonderful writer; not so wonderful publisher,"I've long been a fan of Greg King and knew this would be a well-written, extensively researched biography--and so it is! King is one of our best non-fiction writers, and he does a bang-up job with Sharon Tate.I can't be quite so happy about the job Barricade Books did with his work, though. No bibliography? No index? And the photo section is brief and poorly chosen (all the photos were from one source, so I suspect they just picked the cheapest one and said, ""Give us everything you have on Tate and Manson"").I hope to see a lot more of Kings' work in the future, but I hope for his sake he finds a better publisher."
4,a new outlook on the murders,"You'll never beat Helter Skelter as the definitive book on the subject, but I liked this one because it was more about Sharon and the other victims than about the killers. It gives you a different perspective on the time, the place, the way America, especially Los Angeles, was in 1969. It also includes graphic murder scene and autopsy photos that are not in Helter Skelter. Not for the squeamish, but if you are, you don't want to read about Charlie's ""family"" at all..."
3,"Nothing new really, for beginners only","Though a book on Sharon Tate herself is long overdue, I found this book very disappointing. I felt like I was reading a hodge-podge of warmed over data from every other book or magazine article on the case already published. Those looking for more personal info. on Miss Tate will have to continue to read biographies on other performers who knew her. Amateur sleuths interested in the Manson Family can do better by merely browsing the internet or reading the updated versions of The Family or Helter Skelter."
5,Very enlighting and positve album.,I love the feel of this cd.The song i tell you the truth is beatiful.
2,Fiesta Ceramic Tumbler,Very small. Hardly good for anything. One sip and it's empty. They should have made them larger! Otherwise they are fine.
2,NOT compatible with SLIK 504QF II,"The plate looks solid and well built but had to return it since it was NOT compatible with my tripod even though it says it is (even at the back of the box it says it supports my tripod model).For refference my tripod is SLIK 504 FQ II.On a side note. WARNING ABOUT THE SELLERI rented on few ocasions from Adorama Rentals but this was my first purchase. The staff in the store was very rude and tried to tell me that since it says it's compatible then it has to be compatible...Good thing i brought the tripod with me and SHOWED them that it does not work. I was stunned by their response. They told me to put duck tape to fill the 1.5"" of space that the plate was missing. Duck tape..really?Never gonna shop from this place again. Buyer beware!"
1,SAME OLD STUFF,IT'S OK BUT YOU CAN GO GET MEN OF THE WEST IT'S THE SAME BOOK GETTING TO BE A HABIT OF DP RERELEASING BOOKS WITH DIFFERENT NAME AND COVER
3,Frequent errors mar first print editions,"Frequent typographical errors and fundamental gramatical mistakes in the first printing (due to the publisher's failure to edit the manuscript, according to the author) distracted this reader from the book's content at all times. Be sure you receive the second printing. As of February 2004, Amazon was still selling what I assume is the first printing."
4,Still Good After all these Years,"While not quite as good as 1979's classic ""Squeezing Out Sparks"", this album still manages to encapsulate some of the previous releases raw passion and power. A must have for anyone interested in GP and the Rumour."
3,Look elsewhere first,"By no means should this be your first Graham Parker purchase. (Actually, I think I'd put it at No. 10. At least it's better than ""Another Grey Area,"" ""The Real Macaw,"" ""Steady Nerves"" and ""12 Haunted Episodes."") Not bad, though, if you don't need hooks galore and his best songwriting."
1,SO WHAT,"never captured my attention nothing remotely rememerable, SOUNDS POOR MIDDLE OF THE ROAD latter day weve lost it VITALITY,black,sabatoge; ill take Manilla road any day OR even ORCHESTRAL MANUEVERS IN THE dark any time over this carbon copy vacancy, ALTHOUGH THE cover art is FINE."
1,I just don't get it...,"If Cathedral was your first encounter with this genre, you'd likely go no further and miss out on some great music. Try Electric Wizard instead -- 'Dopethrone' is a doom-groove masterpiece. Cathedral are just cartoon-Sabbath grinders with a vocalist who sounds like Hawkwind's Dave Brock with a sore throat. Yes, that bad. If they'd mixed him down a bit it might have helped...How Napalm Death could ever have spawned this fossil, especially when you consider the quality of their other offshoots (Carcass, Godflesh, Scorn etc.), is beyond me. C'mon kids, I know you're all stoned out there, but there's still such a thing as quality control, right?"
5,Very well made!!!,"Great for afternoon tea, well made like other Fiesta products, nice color, we'll worth the money. And don't forget the matching saucer!"
5,Could not bear to have an incomplete set!!!!!!!,"When my sister dropped the cup I thought oh no and almost banned her from the house. I had ordered another Fiesta Ware item, that the same sister broke, from Amazon.com and thought if it worked once let's try again. Guess what!!! I was able to keep my set intact. Thanks again for everything, having the item, the cost and the fast shipping. My Sister believes that Amazon can supply all of her oops and so do I. Again, thanks for everything."
5,"HEART OPENING, LIFE AFFIRMING POETRY",Kristin Masterton has a fluidity and an ease of expressing the unexpressible- the language of the heart.This book ought to be in every school curriculum and is a must for those feeling disheartened and confused by the focus on what is not real. This is the perfect gift to connect deeply with those with whom we are priviledged to share our lives.This is poetry to be read silently to open up the space within or be read aloud when intimacy is lacking and needs to be established . Brava Kristin and thank you for accomodating our dance with the Divine in us.
3,"it's grindcore, what did you expect","This is not a bad effort. It is loud, fast, angry, and passionate. I mut admit the cookie mosnter vocals can be wearing at times but that's part of the grindcore package. The key with a band like this, is to not concentrate so hard on finding a reason why it could pass as music but rather to see this as a different musical experience all together. This is not music you say? Let me assure you that though low and largely unmelodic to the unprobing ear, this is a form of music with an unbelievable amount of nerve and savage energy! Music like this speaks to a very primal instinct inside of us.I would also encourage reviewers such as Mr. Faulkerson to put aside the Kiss and Alice Cooper records for a second and maybe give some other death metal bands a shot, rather than bashing an entire genre based on a few sound bites. I would recommend a little band called Opeth which has both talent and melody, which you will soon discover, many extreme metal bands do."
3,Seems a little boring for me,"To me, Napalm Deaths worst records started with this album. Not that this album is bad, its just not one of their better ones. The sound, while thick, seems lacking and most songs just dont have anything to them. There are a few good songs, but its not a must have like Harmony Corruption or From Enslavement to Obileration. I actually stopped listening to Napalm Death after the release of this album and the album that followed this one (words from the exit wound). I just lost interest in them.Napalm Death is one of those bands that have gone through many, many line-up changes and gone through various different sounds. After giving up on them in the late 90's, they stormed back with the release of Enemy of the Music Business, which I would highly recommend to fans of extreme music."
3,The later stuffs better,The vocals will always let this down but from the point of view of music this is good. Fast and heavy. Inside the Torn Apart and Words from the Exit Wound are far superior though. Not everyones idea of music but their popularity shows that quite a few are buying their stuff and coming back for more with each new album thats released.This will never be the best album they've done. But they are still far and away the kings of grindcore.
5,Pure grind all over.,"Napalm death has been making the best music for years & years...With every album release being better/stronger i can't see how nd will ever stop. I own every album by nd but fed has to be my favorite out of them! best songs? Hung & more then meet the eyes, lovely titles. Over-all, if you love and is a fan of grind and yet dont own nd's fed you are a disgrace! Go get it and then maiby you'll feel okay about your self."
5,grindcore extremists,"This is a great release from ND. It has a very unique sound of it's own in comparison to their earlier material, too. While not always as fast, it captures an extremley brutal edge that was previously unheard off of any of the early releases. While at parts remaining true to the band's older style, it gets somewhat of a new sound as well. Mark Greenway's words are incredibly involved and complex, not to mention brutal .. Jesse Pintado and Mitch Harris play some truly bone crushing heavy guitar riffs .. Danny Herrera gives a complete demonstration of just how fast, hard and heavy a drum set can be thrashed on .. and Shane Embury holds it all together on bass. Truly a mind blowing experience. I find that mostly every single song on the CD is unforgettable."
3,Good basic overview.,This book is a good basic overview of black powder loading and shooting. Due to the large varriety of black powder firearms and types of shooting it would be difficult to have in depth coverage in a single volume. This is a good overview of the basics of the entire field.
5,best album ive heard this year!!!!,i myself am from Maryland and i heard about these cats through the grapevine. I am very picky when it comes to music. these guys are anything but mainstream and this album is pure rock-n-roll. great musicians and superb tunes!! cant wait to see them live!
2,Looks very cheap,"It's the large glass beads that are of very poor quality in this necklace. Too bad, I paid less for another Nvie necklace and I was more satisfied with that one than this one."
3,don't get stung!,"It's too bad that this book is so bound to it's predecessor....I can't imagine reading it without having read Hour of the Hunter first. Once again I loved the story telling parts about the Native American culture, but I found the characters in this to be shallow and not as believeable. Perhaps I am tired of spending my time reading stories about these psychopaths who just want to get even. There were parts that I found somewhat unbelievable in the characters--the husband, ex-sheriff was a wood cutting wimp for most of the book. The son couldn't make up his mind or take a stand about his marriage--and the guy was going to be a lawyer! Come on, j.a., I think you can do better. I sure hope you do not visit this poor tortured family again with yet another sequel! I'd probably have to read it..."
2,"Mean Characters, Little Empathy","Jance is a strong storyteller, but I didn't enjoy this novel because too many of the characters are mean-spirited. I didn't like spending time with them and didn't want to read about them. Yes, they had reasons to obsess over revenge, but since I never felt they were justified, I didn't feel sorry for them. Jance builds suspense, however, and vividly depicts the Tucson setting.This stand alone is a departure for Jance, but I'm not convinced she's stretching herself in believable ways. For example, she has a jailed inmate talking about ""rewriting a scenario."" Maybe this has happened, but it doesn't ring true. She's also quite didactic here. She wants to teach her readers about Native Americans, but this book about violent revenge is the wrong venue to do so."
2,Couldn't finish,"J.A. Jance is a wonderful writer. Her stories are fresh and her characters well developed. I love reading aboutplaces I know so well. But for me she is too violent. I couldn't finish this book. If you are numb to graphic violence, I would recommend this book. But I don't think it benefits the soul."
1,Poor character development,"I like her JP Beumont books but this book seems to think I have been acquainted with the characters in other books, which I have not. I never could get into the book because the characters were confusing so I quit."
5,Kiss of the Bees has a sting!,"The prize-winning bestseller that made Diana's fortune has caused a rift in her marriage along with a change in politics that has her husband out of a job. Then the evil over which she had survived 20 years earlier, returns. Meanwhile sons & daughters orbit about in the changes of their lives, finding love, being tempted by the unknown & being seduced by greed.With legends & histories of the local Indian nation entwining around a thoroughly modern mystery involving revenge, evil & kidnapping in the blistering heat of the Arizona desert, J. A. Jance has written another compelling mystery. What a read! Lots of dark insights & an occasional inane action by an otherwise impeccable heroine. I loved the wood pile & the grandmother, gone too soon. However, here is a book whose plot revolves around the sanity of one teenager who listened & learnt & because of that brought about redemption. Very well done!"
2,Haven't I read this before?,"I have never read Hour Of the Hunter so I can only judge this book on it's own merits. But, I was not impressed. If you take away all the Native American references you are left with a pale imitation of a Diehl, Cornwell, or Harris book. Lani, of course, is the perfect daughter whom no real harm comes to. In the end Davy's intervention isn't even needed and I couldn't help wondering if the time spent on him wasn't for the purpose of upping the page count. As for the parents they show no insight or realization into their own culpability regarding their children's present day circumstances. This might have actually made them interesting characters. And did anyone not know the killer would die by falling in the hole in the cave?"
2,Contrived Ending,"After a slow start, I was caught up in the book until the ending....it seemed contrived, a little too tidy and very weak. After taking all the trouble to flesh out the plot, the ending was not believable at all for me. I was extremely disappointed and almost felt I'd been ""had""."
1,Creepy,"This book is about serial killers. I found it horrific. I enjoy mysteries, but, I detest horror stories. I really like this author's other books, but, I could only get through about 1/4 of this one."
3,Too confusing,"Could have been an excellent book had it been written in order. Too many words to skip over i'm not interested in learning. The Indian story preceding each chapter was unnecessary, the back and forth stories & Indian lore distracting, a dissappointing outing by an otherwise excellent author."
5,Best release,"The melodicism of this album is brilliant. Easily their best album. The guitar melodies stick and there's only Jeff doing vocals on this one. This is Amott's last album with the band and thereafter forming arch enemy. Carcass' musical career has taken many turns. They began as grindcore and gradually incorporated more melodies which is evident in necrotism and heartwork. Too bad they split up, enormous talent in this band."
5,Masterful,"Somewhere around 2003 and 2004 I started getting into Melodic Death Metal, and I was spoiled right from the start, because ""Heartwork"" was my very first purchase in the sub-genre. No album since has ever met the expectation set by this album from a Melodic Death Metal band. I find EVERY song to be far beyond exceptional. I realize that some fans of the band were not ready for this type of departure from their earlier sound, but I think enough time has passed that people don't need to feel slighted by this album anymore, especially considering how well the product is executed. Get your DEATH CERTIFICATE now."
3,"Cheesy, sold out and I love it","Carcass got tired of the limits of grindcore and went to an equally limited style for some fun before burning out. This is a speed metal album with heavy metal roots, but the grindcore and technical death metal expertise of these players makes for a precise and sentimental yet aggressive album. Even the death metal vocals have melody, and lead guitars are shredding with influences ranging from emo-core to avant-Hindu-jazz. There's a direct lift from Kreator's ""People of the Lie"" (Coma of Souls) on the title track, but this album remains strong unlike all other later works from this band."
1,Disappointing,"If you're a fan of true Death Metal, check out every album Carcass recorded before this one. By the time they made this album they were clearly not interested in playing Death Metal anymore (neither were many of the founding bands of this scene by this point). This album is a silly blend of what the band used to be (Death Metal) and something akin to early 80's/late 70's British heavy metal. If you're into watered down pseudo-Death Metal, then this is for you (although there's better bands out there who do this lighter form of metal better, i.e. Iron Maiden or Judas Priest), but if you're a fan of true Death Metal and music that is heavy and fast, check out Carcass's earlier albums, or pretty much anything by released before 1994 by Napalm Death, Entombed, Morbid Angel or any number of other good bands that were out there founding the Death Metal scene."
1,What Happened???!!!,"What a piece of crap this album is!!! Even the cover art is crap. Come on a peace sign??!! Carcass was my favorite band for a while. They were everything you could want in music. Fast, aggressive music with intelligent lyrics mixed with excellent musicianship. Now they sound like every other band out there. I hope it was worth it...selling out all of your fans for this heaping pile of crap....If you are into grindcore steer far clear of this album as this is NOT what Carcass really is (was)...this is there ""Black Album"" what a bunch of sell outs...I NEVER thought that this would happen to Carcass...Pick up everything that they released before this one..."
2,Not what I expected!,"I am no photoshop pro but I must say I only found about 2 ""tips"" useful in this book out of a 200+ pages. The rest were common sense like ""typing in a circle"".. Most of this information is supplied with the manual. Another ""tip"" listed is changing the color of text & how to change the text font...I was really looking forward to learning something useful =/So if you have no idea about what your doing this this book is for you! It would make a great reference guide. But if you know the basics like how to merge visible layers I would recommend you read something else."
1,Not upto Scott Kelby's standards - very disappointed!,"I am a big fan of Scott Kelby's Photoshop books; however, this book is next to useless. It's full of short ""tips"" that really doesn't amount to anything. He does not go into details, like his other book ""Dirty Tricks"" (highly recommended). I would pass on this book."
4,Good pen,"The pen is exactly what I expected. Old school click mechanism is on the mark, these are hard to come by in a quality pen."
4,"""In too deep"" is way too deep with this soundtrack.","To let you know right off,if you don't like rap,you will not like this soundtrack,but for those who do,this should be a possible purchase for you. The most blazin' songs to me are ""Tear it off"" by Method Man and Redman, ""Keys to the Range"" by Jagged Edge feat. JD, ""Use to me Spending"" by R.Kelly feat. Nokio and Jaz-Ming and ""How to Rob"" by 50 Cent feat. Madd Rapper. The album starts off fast,but slow down at the end with ballads from Imajin,Dave Hollister and Jill Scott,but goes back up a little with the ""Quiet Storm(remix)"". So,if you like the artists,get the soundtrack."
3,pretty Good,"got this soundtrack for R.Kelly's Use to Me spending""It's a Extended on the Classic Jam He did with Biggie.with Nokio&Jaz Ming on Board. this track is worth the soundtrack alone.50 Cent truly had flavor on here.""How To Rob"" is His True Classic thus far IMO.back then the cat was Rawer.there are some decent tracks on here.the Movie was Tossed, but the soundtrack is pretty Good."
1,in to deep,best track was the second track to explictic not music to dance with thought i would enjoy it because i enjoyed the movie but was wrong not a good soundtrack at all.
3,"tear it off best song,jd,nas,5ocents,and mobb deep,good beat","this soundtrack was pretty good. keys to the range and tear it off were the best songs. the album slows down near the end. i was dissapointed with the nas,nature song."
4,Great game no one played!,"Not a kid, I played and loved Archon way back in the day. I got this for my kid for xmas and we love the multi-player. This game would probably have been better known if it would have had xbox live on-line play. I got it cheap,for like 7 bucks, brand new and it is well worth more. If you have friends or kids that like a little strategy with some fighting action then you have got to get this one!"
5,A fantastic insight into our religious similarities!,"Gerald Lund has produced a book that looks into three distinct religions, Judaism, Islam and Mormonism and surprisingly, brings them all together in a way that will do nothing but help one procure love for their fellow men. The main character, Brad Kennison, comes to Jerusalem following the Vietnam War hoping to find some meaning and direction in his life. Through his friendship with Ali, the friendly and proud Arab to his love-hate realtionship with Miriam, the shopkeeper's spitfire daughter, Brad finds a lot more than expected and learns lessons about life and religion that change his life...and will change yours as well."
3,"Nice, but a little undersized","The odd motif on the trivet doesn't really fit the rest of the 'Fiesta' style. Also, while it's heavy and robust, its enough so to make me fear for my table"
2,"Cute, but tends to come along when you don't want it to",and stays in place when you try to move it and the thing it's supporting at the same time. Once I get over the shock that a Fiesta item could ever disappoint I'm going to buy a different kind of trivet.
3,Not worth the money.,"I was so disappointed when this item arrived. It is the only Fiesta product I bought that I didn't love. It is too small to be of use as a trivet, and the design is not impressive."
1,Useless on the table,This is not nearly wide enough to be useful trivet. It is rather small and is really awkward when you use them at the table. Might be fine for a decoration or dust collector but really not a good trivet for the kitchen and dining room.
4,NICE PIC'S,The book has a very nice collection of VW pictures. Photos whith good quality of very good cars. If you like Beetles you will appreciate this book. I think the format of the book is to small so then many pictures are little or printed using two pages (considering the price is still a good book).
3,Japanese Dubs,This book is from a Japan VW car club. It has all of like four cars featured. Not really enjoyable to me.
4,as a new reader brilliant(but i hav trouble writing@riding),as a new reader i look forword to yor book (ps i am 28 yrs old so it is a learning prolbem i live with)points problems and revues are of grate value to me as thay can save me a grate amount of money with two little boys (2ys and 3ys)it is money you ned in your pocket but as i have a good leavel of skill wen it comes to bode work i feal as i have somith to offer to you in the way of free advice as i have restord over 31 v w (vedubs) and i also own a 1964 panl van that as only had 1iner 1outer sill and 1mid under section plus 1 out riger all welding is on the right hand side plus 2k primer @ 2k l31 dove blue paint
2,12 Keys to an Effective Church,"Where the book has interesting topic, the writing is poor, repeating numerous times. I found myself tending to skim rather than read in detail. The thoughts are good however."
5,Boot Camp!,"This was a fun read! Infidel Moslems, and the return of the insufferable Sir Stefan make up the first half of the book, but the Radiant Warrior really shines (no pun intended) in the second half when Conrad attempts to build a US Army-style boot camp for his new Army. Highly recommended!"
4,""" A Great Barbie Playset""","This playset is so cool!! I like the little food dispenser which I thought was sort of awesome. I also like the tiny cat and kittens, plus all the brand named foods. This toy did not dissapoint me, it was fun to play with, and easy to assemble. Mattel did a pretty good job with this playset. I think this is a must have toy, for any Barbie fan!!"
2,All Weekend Project,"The shelf is reasonably attractive and sturdy, but it took days to assemble. First, some of the pieces were missing. We had to purchase needed screws and dowels. Then, when we had the pieces to put the hinges on the doors, we discovered that the particle board wasn't strong enough to hold the hinge assembly. Back to the hardware store for some small anchors to set the door screws. Still, there is about 3/4 inch gap between the doors even after the maximum lateral adjustment. So it is probably not worth the money, considering you can get an open shelf for $50."
1,Horrible!,All the complaints about the construction are true. I'm usually a pro at putting things together but this piece is the worst I've found. It took me about 2.5 hours to put together which isn't as bad as some of the other reviewers. The instructions aren't the greatest but I figured it out despite some of the diagrams being too faded to see. Many pieces do not line up correctly and I couldn't get a couple of the screws to go in completely so a few are sticking out. The doors to the cabinet definitely do not match up and will not close all the way! I would return this product if it weren't such a pain to take it apart. Don't buy!
2,Country Cottage etagere,"Poorly designed, as the doors barely hang straight, and the unit sits so low on the toilet that the legs barely touch the floor. So anyone who has the newer, higher-rise toilets should be aware that it really is made for standard height units. Should be fastened to the wall for stability."
3,Almost gave up assembling,"Now that it's assembled, I like the piece. However, this was a royal pain to assemble, and I usually don't have problems with this type of thing. I had to use my own wood glue because it was falling apart after the first assembly. I highly recommend joining all pieces with wood glue, in addition to the supplied hardware. The pieces wouldn't square and I ended up screwing in one of the shelves with my own screw on the side, then covering the screw head with liquid paper to hide. Very un-sturdy until the stabilizing piece is applied to the wall... it's a must.Doors are good quality. Looks nice and I'm able to store what I intended.The makers could also make this easier by labeling the pieces with a stamped number, like most do-it-yourself assembly pieces."
5,amazing photography,this book is amazing and not so easy to find. anyone who likes skulls and morbid stuff this is the book for you. its also written in four languages.
4,Interesting intro,"A combination of lit crit, history and biography, this brief book ultimately feels like an appetizer rather than a meal, despite its nearly 200 pages. A tasty appetizer however as it is brimming with fascinating facts about Elizabethan theater and Shakespeares plays (and language). Extremely readable, it may be too superficial for Shakespearean scholars but for the general reader who wants a quick overview of things Shakespeare, this lovely little book should fit the bill."

3,Looks Great! - Too fragile to ship!,"The face looks great on the tree. Main problem is the first one arrived with a broken antler. We called and they said they would ship us out another one. They were very nice. The second one arrive, a complete set again, and one of it's antlers was broken worse than the first set, and it was the same left antler. I just gave up at this point and put the broken antler up. Like I said, a great look, just poor workmanship or something."
1,"""Dripless"" is just an ad label","This is an amended review. I first used the tool outdoors in 40-50 degree days and found it close to dripless. At warmer temperatures and with the caulk more liquid, the gun is no more dripless than any other that I have used. The gun has some nice frills--it is easier to clean than cheaper tools, it has a more convenient/useful cutter and puncture pin, etc., but labeling it as dripless is pure bunk."
2,This drips like the rest of the cheap caulk gun,"I bought this because I detest how the silicon caulks drip out even after I release the trigger. From other reviews, it seems that this won't happen, unfortunately it's no difference. Would I spend this much money on this gun if I know this? Never."
5,"Finally, a good one!","Sikaflex, silicone, loctite... Nothing doesn't get squirted by this gun. Oh, and the no drip actually works! Highly impressed with this."
2,Too Tough To Die(Johnny Ramone),"I don't get it,it was suppose to be a tribute to Johnny Ramone,but All you get Is all these Bands Riding the Coattails and doing Ramones songs a Disservice."
5,For True Ranones Fans!!,"This is a must have if your a true fan. The Dickies put on one hell of a show, and the Chilli Peppers were great. This was one hell of a show and I wish I'd been there!"
5,air filter,Received both a drive belt as well as an air filter for a pull behind mower powered by a Briggs & Stratton engine. I wascompletely satisfied with both purchases. The shipments were packaged well and received in a timely fashion.
3,"Readable, not much more...","This Manga isn't really what you expect... It is entertaining for a while and then takes a plunge for the worse. Caravan Kid was so much better. The humor in this Manga virtually inexistent! I say NO! Stay with Ranma for humor and 3x3 eyes for action! If it's Sci-Fi you want, buy some eps of Neon Genesis Evangelion! And just why do they all have scandinavian names? Gustav and Olzen? Hmmm... I still read it anyway but don't be fooled by the promise of a shower scene... This is Otaku material, nothing more..."
5,Outstanding lens!! - - - - - Do not buy the Lens Hood,"This is a great lens. I won't get into much detail because there is already so much information readily available about this lens. I do, however, want to warn potential buyers. DO NOT BUY THE LENS HOOD it already comes with one. It appears that a few of us have already made that mistake. I personally have 2 lens hoods now."
5,More than expected...,One thing that was a BIG surprise on this lens was finding in the box the travel pouch and the hood on the same box. The lens is sturdy and silent.Excelent quality... the only bad part... Hard to use in low light conditions.
4,Exceptional,Great lens. I find I rarely take this lens off my camera. Exceptional for shooting all the kids sports. Only draw back would be indoor sports. A 2.8 lens or faster is needed for indoors.
3,70-200 f4,"I had thought long and hard about this lens before purchasing it, and ive had it now a couple months and taken a thousand or so shots with it. I have had the chance to also borrow a friends 70 -300is while not an L lens it does yield good results.. for me im not saying the 70-200 is a bad lens because it isnt its a great buy for the money ... but the IS helps and i know in my heart the F2.8IS 70-200 was the way i should have gone. and will replace the f4 with it before long."
4,Awesome starter lens,"This was one of the first lenses I bought for my camera beyond the kit lens, and I must say it has served me very well. At the wide end (70mm) it is just wide enough to capture the majority of the shots I need, and at the long end (200mm) it provides the extra reach I need to get closer to my subjects, without getting in the way. This lens is also reasonably quick (f/4) and works surprisingly well in low light conditions. Unfortunately I now need something a little longer and faster, and even with a 1.4x teleconverter, it's just not enough.Pros:Quick and decent performance (even in low light conditions)Good range with wide angle and telephoto abilitiesLight and Compact that makes it easy to carry around all dayCons:Not as long as I'd likeNot as fast as the f/2.8 lens (Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras)No Image Stabilization"
5,spiders camera review,this is a top of the line canon lens. 5 stars! always get a USM lens when shopping. you don't need to think about this one!!! no brainer!!! low price too!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Cheap price - high quality,"This is another great Canon L series lense. I've been very impressed with it, especially considering the price. It gives very good range from 70-200mm. I've used it for scenic picts, for sport and for wildlife photography. This is a very light lense too. While it is quite long, it's not hard to carry it around.If anyone is considering a telezoom lense, then gives this one some serious consideration. You certainly won't regret it."
4,"My first L pro lens, recommended for low budget","PROS:L serie, hood is included, zoom quality, zoom is internal to the lens, you really feel the differences when using it.Perfect for lighted object, tripod uses, nature shots, portraits->I recommended it as your first L lens. I'm happy with my many USM lens but you will really like this ""cheap"" and really hight quality Lens as you first L lens in your kit. Enjoy!CONS:...not stabilized but the ""IS"" version is too expansive. IS version is a good idea if you can afford its price....not bad weather protected, being a bigger lens you MUST protect it. Mind it!F4 in low light condition requires a flash or very high ISOs and a tripod but you can learn how to use it in various conditions. Just give it a try and you will love it."
4,Great lens,Incredible lens. use it for sports and event photography (with a flash) and the results are incredibly sharp and focus is always spot on.
5,Canon EF 70-200 mm lens,"I apologize for not being technie enough to be able to rate this item based on all of it's technical attributes, but I love the lens, have had great photo results.The purchase price was extremely reasonable and the item was received rapidly and packed very well.I would definitely purchase from this vendor again!!"
4,Almost perfect!,"Love this lense but the only problem is that once you buy it and used it some months, you will wish to buy the Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras!"
5,Just WOW,"At first, I had a selection of third-party lenses. Nothing bad, just none that were spectacular. I was somewhat disappointed in the shots I got. Then I bought the 85/1.8 and saw the contrast and colors I was expecting. Since then, I've bought several Canon lenses and this one is my latest.Like the title says, WOW. My first shots were in the house and around it and at all apertures and zoom lengths, the shots are simply incredible. Just fantastic sharpness - no PS USM needed! The colors are real and vibrant and the contrast is sharp and clear.This (and my 24-105/4L) is what lenses SHOULD be. Well built, solid and great glass. Sure, you do pay more. And you could enhance your shots with PS. But to see the results from these lenses vs the cheaper alternatives, you'll see what you spent all that money for!I'm sold on Canon."
4,"not fast, but good","this is not a fast lens. but if you are outside and have alot of light, worth the price of admission."
5,"Canon ""L"" is for LOVE","I've always heard great things about Canon L series lenses. Some say it means ""luxury"". I really think it means love. Once you touch and use a Canon ""L"" lense, there seriously is no turning back. The sharpness, colour, contrast is unparallel. It stacks up to my Carl Zeiss lense on my other camera. The only thing I could ask for is a lower price for the 70-200 F/2.8 L IS USM lense. I'll be looking to upgrade to a faster lense sometime in the near future."
5,"seriously, buy it","I previously owned the Canon 70-200 2.8 non-IS lens. I loved everything about it other than it weighed about 5 pounds. That may not seem like much but it feels more like 20 when you go on a long hike.Around to my point, this F4 version is amazing. Seemingly 1/2 the weight, every bit as sharp and a delight to work. It's silky smooth when zooming and very fast at autofocusing. Tack-sharp. If you're that concerned about upgrading to the 2.8 or not, save yourself the money and the hastle of the extra weight and just turn up your ISO by 1 f-stop."
5,Amazing product for a great price (used),"I really wanted to step into the L series of Canon lens', however photography is not my profession so justifying the money for this type of lens was tough. I chose this because it was the most affordable L series. It does not have image stabilization, but oh well. You really only need IS for inside shots requiring more light, portrait shots. This lens is designed for action shots and I use it to take pictures riding big mountain (skiing). The price difference between this lens and the EF 70-300 F/4L IS is about $700. So it was a perfect fit. It is one solid piece and is top quality. I would highly recommend, if owning a DSLR camera to have an L series lens in your bag of tricks. You do not have to have a Full Frame camera to get amazing shots, you just need an amazing lens!"
3,MFC 4 not what I expected,"Our company purchased some old software. This book was recommended to me in order to research some of the older technology. This book is poorly written. I also found typos within the first Introduction section. It is one of those books that rushes you right into coding your first program to give those impatient numbers of programmers a warm fuzzy feeling of accomplishment. Smoke and mirrors I say. The value of this book, even when the MFC 4 was new, was probably very little."
5,201 Great questions,Love the book creates a lot of conversations between kids and adults that you might otherwise not have.
4,Misogynist Redux,"Poor Philip. If he had only been born fifty years later he would have his own radio talk show and blog.Read his words and although some will horrify you, there are glimpses of insight nestled away there that will tickle your funny bone and your intellect."
2,blurb was better than the book,"I have read almost all of Margaret Yorke's books and must say that this one and her previous one were disappointing. It is true that her style is slower than other writers of the genre, but these two books were particularly slow and the plot was too obvious. I prefer her books where she keeps you guessing and then something other than the obvious occurs."
3,felt ripped off,Have not yet played the CD yet as it is a Christmas CD that I bought after Christmas; however I was very disappointed that I paid $14.99 for the CD and the CD came with a sticker on it for $6.99. I felt ripped off.
5,Looking for solutions...,"If you are looking for solutions to the some of the typical problems of Windows GUI,you will find a lot of them here."
3,Not worth it- Techniques are not guaranteed,"listen to this: ""I can not guarantee that the application will fuction properly after you make the changes ,so i recommend that a copy of the project be used""Page 32 Line 5So why should i learn something that is not definite?????I rest my case."
1,Skip it this year,"This series is really showing its age. The selection this year is particularly poor, with very few exceptions. The problem is that both Collins and Lehman prefer a kind of watered-down, anecdotal style rather than truly challenging work. Too many names are repeated from past BAPS.Somthing must be done to alter this formula and give this series new life, because it really could be a great thing."
5,the best I've read in the series,"There is no doubt in my mind that 06's collection is the best I've read (and I've been reading them for some time now), though to be fair, somehow I missed 2005--though I'm not much for Hejimen's taste. I'm not surprised how good this one is though, after all, Billy Collins selected them, and he is a phenomenal poet with great taste. He picked poems that covered all schools but were told in language and images that we can all appreciate and understand. Keep picking poets like this (hey, consider Gioia, Dave Mason and R.S. Gwynn--they'll give you collections as good or better than even this one.)."
1,So what?,"I found this work disappointing for two reasons. Firstly, it is an indulgence in highly speculative metaphysics. If not-knowing is an essential means to ego transcendence, what possible benefit can there be for a teacher to put knowing before his students? I frequently found myself saying, ""Interesting, but so what?""Secondly, the writing is in the style of a journal and consequently suffers from the habit of a writer writing to himself. Since he already understands what he is saying, he doesn't take care that someone else would understand it as well."
2,Papers not Strong Enough,This book is from Nelson but it is not printed in Belgium but instead in Korea. The papers are very thin. The book printed in Belgium has stronger papers with better durability.The covers are not genuine leather.The words are very small and maybe for people with good eye vision.I haven't checked the content carefully yet.
5,If only everything would clean so easily,This product is perfect. You just thoroughly spray your chandeliers with it and let it drip off and take all the dirt with it. Just make sure you put some towels underneath so that it catches the liquid.
1,A WORKOUT OR A COMMERCIAL?,"If I could have given less than one star on this purchase I would have done so. What a huge disappointment. The dance combinations when performed together lasts for exactly 42.2 SECONDS! And these are not difficult combinations. Her segment advertising her other videos: 3:37, her bio segment 1:03 and her performance segment 4:09. Her performance segment in not even a bhangra dance. It is an average performance of classical Indian dance, more notable for it's interesting camera angles and special effects.I teach dance for exercise and was hoping to learn some bhangra to lend some authenticity to my Bollywood routines. These combination would not even be sufficient to fill the chorus in the music.I will definitely be returning this."
5,Fascinating California history and a good story too!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I'm way older than the juvenile target audience. The well-researched historical background, and fictionalization of real events, makes it far more than just a retelling of an old folk tale. Ready and his family are fully-drawn, believable characters with many of the problems today's families face, though we probably aren't hoping to strike it rich in the gold fields. I recommend this book to parents as an excellent read-aloud, especially for boys 8 and up, but I think girls would enjoy it too."
1,garbage,"this cd, and i presume artist (this was from what..1999? he could've evolved), is garbage. purchased completely unheard based off all of the raving 5 star reviews and comparisons to jack johnson and ben harper that i read here at amazon. what a load of bull...mishka himself must've came on here and written those himself. i guess if you are into extremely slow tempoed, john mayer ballad type songs this may be good, but to compare him to jack and ben harper who can actually play instruments and get funky is a travesty."
5,Mishka is a breath of fresh air,This album is wonderful with powerful lyrics and very catchy tunes. I would say that if you are a die hard reggae fan you may find mishka a bit cheesy. If you are like me and just have a few bob CDs then it is great when you are in the mood. Having had the pleasure of seeing Mishka live it instills the feeling of the summer sun and then the rain which fell when Mishka started to play 'I'll always be there when the rain comes down'. There is a hidden acoustic track at the end which is one of his finest. The guy himself is one of the most chilled people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting and this shines through in his music which tends to rub off on the listener. If there are any stressed city types reading this who want a way to relax in their offices or cars then may I suggest a little Mishka?
2,Dissapointing,"If you aren't an artist you may be frustrated by this one. I really didn't find this useful at all. I like great photos, but when it comes to paint books I want the artist to tell me HOW they did it, technique, paint mixing and all. Nice pictures won't help me mix paints or re-create the look in my own home. I have another book on faux finishing that tells you the ingredients. Ex: mix ochre with raw umber, 1 part glaze to 3 parts paint etc etc. I find that far more helpful. I think there are far better faux finish books on the market."
2,Not What A Paint Technique Should Be,"Aside from the out of date, cheesy and lame styles that are in the book, the ""techniques"" are very general and don't really teach you how to do them. Don't waste your time."
3,Good read,I would recommend for readers that have an interest in Marine corp history. Interesting perspective of WWII fighting in Guadacanal.
4,Nothing special but OK,"I agree with the previous reviewer, this particular release (27) doesn't really stand out. But it's still very nice, and is a must for every Tunnel fan. They've now started putting 22 tracks per CD, two more than before.CD1 starts off fairly hard (e.g. Belushi - Put Your Hands In The Air) and becomes very trancey toward the end (e.g. Ayumi). In between we have the tracks from Starsplash and DJ Shog, a trancey remix of Talla2XLC's ""Innocence"", and a couple of great hard-dance hits. Note: 18 and 19 are switched in the tracklisting.CD2 as far as I'm concerned has little value in terms of listening pleasure, I don't think I can name a single standout track but those into the more progressive sound will probably like it.Summary: not the best, but still OK."
3,Just O.K. by TTF Standards,"DJ Dean has made his mark in the Hard Trance world with his Tunnel Trance Force series. ""40 Maxximum Overdrive Trance Traxx"" it states on this album, but it really could be cut in half. If you are looking for the best tracks I'd say disc two is better, but neither has the nonstop revolving energy that the earlier albums have.If you've made it this far then you already know that Tunnel Trance Force is a great series. That being said I would definitely recommend finding one of DJ Dean's older albums with much better Amazon feedback (I'm actually listening to 24 CD1 as we speak. Good set! And of course 12 is a mainstay.)Anyway, I hope this helps you on your expensive purchase decision!MP"
4,Excellent prenatal,"I've done a lot of homework on vitamins and prenatals lately, reading up on specific nutrients, best forms to take, etc. This one the best I've seen, and I love that it includes (some) choline which most don't. I also love that the ingredient list is detailed (like what type of choline etc). It even has a full daily value of calcium (before these I was taking calium separately). I'll be taking this along with extra choline and omega 3s.The only thing I don't like about it is that it says it uses organic ingredients, but if you go to their website, you see that ONLY the rose hips is organic. I'll still like this one, but this seems a little misleading."
5,Impressed my CPMs,"I loved the look on my midwives' face when I showed them these at my 12 week appointment. They all wrote the name down to share with other women :) I'm 23 weeks now and still love them, I'll be taking them while I breast feed as well."
2,Smell differently this time,I had this before. but this bottle smells differently and I cannot take it at all!
2,"Draggy, old fashioned, cliche ridden and not suspenseful","I've read all of Penny Hayes books and was looking forward to reading this one. This story about a housewife living in the early 1970s who is married to a domineering jerk and two horrible and selfish children. The housewife finds out that she can travel back in time but thinks she's going crazy when it happens. The end of this books was abrupt. There was also absolutely no sex in this book, unlike Ms. Hayes other stories (if its a love story, there needs to be at least ONE love scene!) I also didn't buy that a married woman would fall instantly in love with the lady from the past because they barely exchanged more then a few words. The whole book was not as entertaining as Hayes's other books. I traded this book in at my local gay bookstore for a store credit ..."
1,Not What I Expected,"This book was so full of history it didn't leave time for me to understand how Marian and Eloise got together and why it was important for them to be together. Eloise threw me because she enjoyed the sex with her husband but couldn't wait to get to Marion. I felt like there must have been a chapter left out or something. The ending also made no sense, it ended abruptly and without any true conclusion. I just didn't get it."
1,Very Disappointing,This was not worth the read. Got tired of her husband always Not much in to time travel either.
2,"disappointed ,avid book reader","i was exspecting a book similar to her other books with western context.i don't care much for time travel, and that is what this book reminded me of"
1,An utter train wreck,"Let's cut right down to the bone. This cd (as most Massacre fans agree) is horrendous. All the brilliant elements of the previous material are nonexistent.. This album is uncreative and uninspired. The fact it sounds like a different band isn't necessarily the worst thing, however the fact it sounds like inexperienced 14 year olds is. . All things considered, at least listen to this album first, don't be like me and take a gamble and pick it up without hearing it. If you like bands like Godsmack, Disturbed and Hatebreed, you might think this cd rocks. But if you prefer slamming Death Metal, you may want to be forewarned. In closing this is the worst material they made, I would recommend the From Beyond and Inhuman Condition albums Instead."
1,"Great story, disturbing graphics","This book is well constructed but I wouldn't even take it free because of the disturbing illustrations. The words of this classic story are in a constant struggle with the accompanying images in this edition, which attempt to reinterpret many details. The extra-vibrant, distractingly bizarre photo-like images greatly detract from the story. Much better to go with something like the version illustrated by Michael Hague.The Wizard of Oz"
4,beautiful and new,"I have to say Lizbeth Zwerger has made a wonderful new interpretation of Oz. I like her Dorothy with short cropped hair, her catlike cowardly lion, and her valient tin woodman. She has given wind swept pictures with delightful characters. My only quam is her fat and boring scarecrow, who lacks the whismy of Hague, Santore, and Denslow. She could have also made more green for the emerald city but the addition of green glasses made it wonderful and fun. Her pictures are not as bold as Charles Santore, but they are unusual and beautiful and worth a look."
3,book doesn't include green eyeglasses,"I was disappointed to find that these copies do not include the original green eyeglasses to use once you've entered into OZ. The original editions did include the eyewear but not these. As a result, I now have four OZ books to return to Amazon due to an ever expanding series of mistakes, including online customer reviews that stated the glasses were included. The book itself is fine as an example of Lisbeth Zwergers work but the omission of the glasses is detrimental to the story and the illustrators intent."
3,A great read,I would recommend this book to historians and politicians for comparisons to government. The emerald city could be Washington DC.
5,thanks for the excellent service,My son had left his library book out and our dog ate the corners..They were going to charge us a fortune to replace it and you helped us to replace his book. Many thank Yous....
5,"For me, this is the real Wizard Of Oz","When I read this book as a child, I was entranced by the story and the wonderful illustrations of Libico Maraja. When I finally saw the movie, I hated it. It didn't live up to the book in any way. For me, the world of OZ is forever captured in the lush images created by Maraja - especially Glinda, who is a fox compared to the fluffy confection in the movie!"
1,Not what was promised,I ordered a new one this is not new and it has marks on the back cover and the top part of the book has like a page rip up top i ordered new i wish it looked new and i found this stuff on the side of the book idk what it is i am gonna have to buy goo gone...thanks....
1,Missing pages! Beware!,"My 6 year old and I read this book together and she loved the story as I did. This review is for this particular publication of the book. On page 82 the chapter stops short, the next chapter begins, then the printing goes back to the previous chapter. Luckily my mom had a different copy that she read to us over the phone to bridge the gap of missing pages. I've contacted the publisher twice and they promptly sent me 2 more FAULTY copies of the book. FIND ANOTHER COPY!"
4,"""The Hero's Journey, Mostly in Color","This was a Christmas gift (suggested by me) to add to resources about Joseph Campbell's ""Hero's Journey.""Ken Vogel (""A Writer's Journey"") and others cite Oz as a ""perfect"" example of the elements of the Hero'sJourney, and, of course it is a marvel of good writing and film (even if it didn't win the 1939 Oscar).The illustrations are wonderful, the text appropriate, but not the complete version.Donn Doyle"
5,The Wizard of Oz,Wonderful picture. A great thing to add to any kids Library. I have enjoy this book with our 6 year old. She like the movie and she wanted a copy of the book. So I keep looking for the Wizard of Oz with lot of colorful picture and this one was right on.Thanks so muchRacheal Kirkland
2,Great book except for the missing pages!!,"Great book except for the missing page(s). Page 182 the sentence stops mid-sentence and a new chapter begins. Not sure how much is missing, but a major misprint! Find another version."
2,so much left out!,"I bought this because it had such good reviews, but as a fan of the original book, I was sorely disappointed. So much of the story was left out. I wanted something to share with my nieces to show them how much more there was than the movie. While this book was beautifully illustrated, it was missing so much!"
1,Unacceptable,"Unfortunately I did not test it sooner. I didn't expect it to not work.I pulled it out of the box, screwed it to the ceiling, put my mirror ball on it and plugged it in.No spinning, just an ugly sound.I never dropped it, I never had any accidents. I did everything carefully.I tried opening it up to see if I could fix it but that was not possible.I really can't believe something like this was sent to me.Really unacceptable."
4,3 rpm???,"The product worked great, it spins a disco ball but we found that the speed was faster than 3rpm as it started to warm up. Even the booklet that came with it said 1-5rpm, which was fine. We had a great event none the less!!! Fast shipping!! Would use again!"
4,Great for older Eagles Fans,A great book for a walk down memory lane; a very quick read; a book to share with younger Eagle fans about the past Eagle heroes and some obscure Eagles.
2,Sloppy work.,"The selections led me to buy this volume, but the book is ridiculously full of typos. I am looking for another Wilde anthology for that reason alone."
5,Hazel: The Complete Fourth Season,"Hazel is a WINNER! I love watching these episodes. It's wonderful to watch a show that is fun, positive and uplifting. Now I want to get the fifth season..."
5,More!,"If your a Hazel fan what more can you say. Always enjoy the episodes, relaxing and nothing objectionalthat you cant watch with your whole family. I cant wait for season 5."
1,Hazel: The Complete Fouth Season,"I didn't get to see all the shows. I clicked on episodes and they would come up and when I clicked on one, it wouldn't play.I had a hard time trying to watch any of the shows. I've never encountered this problem before."
5,Season 4,So happy with Season 4 hope that Season 5 will be out soon. Is is very pleasing to have Hazel in our home.
5,Good battery,"Good replacement. Works well with no issues. Lasts for many photos, at least now while new. Good value. No issues"
4,"i love ladytron, BUT...","so this album is totally good. but not GREAT. i would actually give it 3.5 stars. where to begin... ok, so i guess ladytron are these rockers now, or something? when i heard their cover of ""oops oh my"" from softcore jukebox, and then ""sugar"" from the becoming xxx soundtrack, i was like ""please please no more GUITARS!!!"" but inevitably, it happened, and here we have the witching hour. it's not bad at all, just the exact direction i was hoping ladytron would not go. it sounds very produced. i was always into ladytron being kind of the modern-day kraftwerk, kind of like four fashionable robots behind their keyboards (604 is in the top 5 of my favorite albums ever). light and magic sounded very over-produced as well, but it sounded like ladytron being over-produced. witching hour is almost like another band entirely. like what if ladytron decided to become a lush cover band. and there's not enough mira!!!"
4,These guys show great promise...,"..I dont blindly worship them, but they could give the continually repeating 3 chord synth drone a rest, Learn some arranging, use some acoustical musical instruments and write lyrics with a bit more depth.I realize they are around 25 (almost over the hill ;-) and that this is purposely club/dance music, and they still need experience.But I like their dark sense of brooding, and I love EVERYTHING YOU TOUCH.They have the potential to be more than just yesterdays flavor-and I really hope they keep breaking through.Though they seem to be having legal problems up the ying yang.Prog House-a new category alltogether.I dont want to seem just critical, soHeres to ya LADYTRON!"
2,Repetitive and Uninspired,"Call it an album ""theme"" if you want, but all of the songs on this album have such a similar sound to them that unless that sound really does it for you, I really can't see you enjoying it that much. I found maybe a couple tracks that were worth holding on to (International Dateline and Sugar, hence the two stars), but by and large I found myself waiting for the next song to start, hoping that it would somehow be more interesting than the last. Apart from those two songs, nothing interesting really came."
2,Lacking...,"This album made me yearn for more...unfortunately they didn't give me anything that good in the first place! The compositions themselves aren't very creative or new, and to my ears there's just too many loud B.S. ambient guitar parts. I'm a fan of Ladytron and many related and unrelated artists. This album just missed the mark...for me."
2,It hurts me to hate it.,"I tried so hard to like this, but it's so boring. What happened to the quirky electro embellishments, the funky beats, and the cooky but cool lyrics(black plastic chairs, anyone?). This cd is a disappointment. It's got a few catchy songs, but it doesn't have the edge that 604 and Light And Magic had. It really hurts me to give Ladytron only two stars.I hate guitars. They've ruined Ladytron."
2,Ladytron has lost it...,"This time around Ladytron is sounding less electroclash and more punky which is certainly a bad thing. As a electroclash or new wave revivalist band Ladytron was doing a great job and everybody was wishing to hear the evolution on their next album. This is not an evolution, its a change of style. They are trying to be Franz Ferdinands clone and may I say, they do it very wrong. IF you were hoping to hear the same Ladytron it was used to be but with new fresh ideas you will be dissapointed. This is Ladytron as a B class punk revival group. No melodies, no hooks, no catchy songs, no memorable songs, no nothing. Don't waste your money, at least BE SURE to sample or hear the album BEFORE BUYING."
4,Ladytron might grow on you,"This is my first Ladytron album, and it has really grown on me. Excellent balance between vocals and arrangements, and the sound really comes together on a number of tracks: Destroy Everything You Touch, Sugar, WhiteLightGenerator, and All The Way. There are simply enough good tracks to justify buying the album.What I like about this album is it sounds good on a cursory listen such as in the background whist working, but also has a lot of depth and complexity for more focused listening. Highly recommended."
5,A masterpiece of electrogoth atmosphere,"My girlfriend and I walked into a goth nightclub recently and heard these amazing tracks. I had to ask who it was. This is the first I've heard of this group and I have to say I am extremely impressed with what they've done here. If you're lucky one night you too will have a similar experience; it's perfect for late-night, very loud, smoky, dark, laser-lit venues, replete with PVC-attired patrons dressed in black. It's very sexual, fetishistic music. The vocals are extraordinary. It's reminiscent of material released years ago for the 4AD label in the UK. I commend the production very highly. This is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time."
3,"A New Ladytron Sound, but I've Heard it Before","This is a harder-edged Ladytron, which appealed to me at first. The typical all-synth mixes now have nice electric guitar tracks. However, I must say that the minimal variety to the overall sound of this album makes me not so inclined to listen to the whole thing at one sitting, because each track sounds so much alike. However, there are a few good cuts on the CD; and I particularly like ""Destroy Everything You Touch"" and ""International Dateline."" Overall, this has a feeling of Eighties New Wave pre-Electroclash. It's a very downbeat set of tracks a'la Curve of yore with a punk wave influence."
5,Lonely Planet Bolivia: A Travel Survival Kit,"This is the best travel guide I have ever used. It is one of two guidebooks (LP Lonely Planet Peru was the other) that gave me enough info. to know for certain where I did and did not want to visit before I went. Description was given as to what inexpensive hotels were nice to hang out in (provided unique and interesting features - not just a list of facilities) so I made for those places as soon as I got off the bus (beating other tourists). Enough detail was given about various Andean treks that we had chosen one before we left home and had selected the recommended agency. Ditto for our week-long jungle adventure. The book even included names of reputable tour guides, one of whom I used in Sucre. Don't leave home without it!"
3,Adequate but disorganized,"Full of decent information, but highly disorganized. I would read something in the hotel, decide to go there, then on my way find I needed to refer back to the book. I could never find the original entry when I needed it. Fodor's South America had much less information, but is a better book for Bolivia."
3,Netaya necklace,It was a nice necklace. Well made. It was a bit too short for me. It is very shiny. I did return the necklace because it was a bit too small. I had my refund in 3 weeks. Nice company. I would buy from them again.
1,Lemon!!!,"This was my first and last computer from HP. I purchased 2 units for my kids. Both are/were, since one is dead, extremelly loud.I have been working with computers for over 20 yearsand, with the exception of Symbolics LISP machines,had never had a unit break on me after 8 months! ""NMI: Parity error/Memory Parity error"" was the error displayed.I have been very disappointed with the email and phonesupport from Compaq/HP. I was on holdfor over 2 hour just to get someone in India, whocould not speak English, and when I ask to speak witha manager I was transferred back to the main menu. Iwill make sure that I will neverpurchase HP computer again."
1,Would be zero stars if possible.,"This was supposed to be a new computer, however, when it arrived, the box said that it was refurbished.The modem did not work.The customer service was poor. Obtaining a return authorization was like pulling teeth.Other that that, everything was great!!!My recommendation -- do not buy from Compaq or Office Depot."
4,amazing pc,"i love this pc i got it as a birthday present and it is awsome. it runs multiple files so easily.mine came with 248 MB of ram and 2.60 GHZ i got it at wall-mart for $500.the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it does not run games to perfectly.but,it downloads things(like songs,and games) very fast.all around a good computer(even though it is a little noisy)p.s. i love the burner/compact disk combo drive"
1,Do Not Recommend,"See my review of ""The Dark Fantastic"". Here again the bad language I found early on caused me to decide not to finish reading."
5,Very Pleased,"I just got a jornada about 2 weeks ago and I must say I am very happy with my purchase. I also added on a sierra wireless modem to have complete mobile internet access(telnet,ftp,irc,web etc). The Keyboard is a good size but people with larger hands may have trouble typing. Of all of my electro-fetish buys, I would have to say I did not regret making this purchase. Also there is a company called ""In Case"" designs which makes a great case for it.enjoy fellow techno-geeks"
4,"Great, but I would like to see more!","These companies of HPCs are playing the market. This Jornada 680, has the size and portability that a laptop doesn't have, and I love it for that, but the features are pittyful! If the size were a little bigger, than they could easily put in a 10 Gig hard-drive, 64mb ram, and 400+ mHz proccesor. A PERFECT example of this is a small sony laptop, but I do not remember the model name. It is a little larger than my Jornada, but has a 30 Gig HD, 700MHZ proccesor, 128 RAM, and Windows XP!!!... I recommend you wait, prices will DROP, and new FAST, SMALL, SEXY proccesors are coming out!!!"
1,Pseudo Compatability Still a Serious Problem,"All the CE based hand held or palm computers have the same basic problem. Lack of real Compatability with the MS Applications they are intended to help you work with on the road. Any kind of complicated documents loose all their traits once they are transferred to the CE device leaving a considerable reformating job to do when you get gack to the office. They also require, generally speaking, reading glasses to use.If they could handle documents just like real PC MS apps, then you would have something. Till then, they are just an expensive, and usually very large (relatively speaking) address book."
1,what junk,"I write under very special conditions. I was using a palm with a keyboard, but I found it not to be powerful enough. A laptop was too heavy, the battery life was miserable, and it took forever to turn on. I found a jornada on Ebay. It is a piece of junk! They get constant memory losses, and it took a week for the screen to fall right off its hinges. I got another and it was wiped with the most crucial information of my life. Like you I read negative revues and gave it the benefit of the doubt(after all I love all electronics), but heed my warning STAND CLEAR."
5,The HP Jornada 680 is a powerful business tool.,I use the HP Jornada 680 to keep all of my business contacts handy via ACT!. I also utilize the synchrnonization capabilities with my laptop to keep current versions of Excel and Word files available for immediate access when in the field. I do not have to wait for the laptop to boot-up but can simply press the power button on the Jornada 680 and I can retrieve and modify my data. The Jornada 680 is very fast even when accessing a large file from the FlashRam card. I use Microsoft Streets & Trips 2000 to download a map to the Jornada 680 that includes the places that I will be traveling to that day so I always have a current map when in the field. If you need a powerful PDA that can manage a wide range of business applications and easlily synchronize with a laptop/desktop machine this is it.
1,Don't try this at home,"If you think you are going to be able to use the Jornada to pick up email from your company server while out of the office, think again. Although the manual says you can set it up to do this, the techs at HP don't have a clue about how to make it work. After paying the best technical guy I know for a full day's time, he also couldn't make it work. If you remember to leave your desktop computer on, you can pick up email in the Active Sync mode. But if you forget, you're out of luck. This seeems to be due to the fact that Windows CE, like many Microsoft products, just has too many bugs. The Jornada is NOT ready for prime time. Save your money and get a ligthweight laptop that runs Windows 95 if you want to be in touch while on the road."
1,There are better alternatives...,"I like the hand-held ""PC's""... but not this one. They are terrific for certain functions... basic word processing, email... carrying contacts out on the road... but the HP 680 just doesn't hold up. The hinges broke after only a month of use on the road. HP would not cover the repair under warrenty... because ""pry marks voided the warrenty"".... OK, but try to change the battery without leaving pry marks. I've since moved to the NEC MobilePro 780... It's much better constructed, holding up to wear-and-tear much more robustly. It's also lighter and gets better battery life... a much better alternative to the Jornada."
4,This album is like a drug,"Very ""addictive"" in a word. If a particularity the sabbath sound has is:addictive once you tested you cant live without listen any band with this influence at least once a week and Sleep is like an energetic bar with this ingredient that you need to consume in your regular meals , that heavy and slow riffs , followed then by a rythm section with a lot of bass and drums and a voice like out of this world and lirycs sometimes incomprehensible completes a style that many bands have adopted and remain loyal to itHM"
3,How Sleepy was my Sabbath?,"This one has got BLACK SABBATH written all over it and it's okay, though the songs aren't anything special. But the entire catalogue of Saint Vitus, a much better Sab-influenced band, has been deleted, so this is a good enough alternative for Ozzy-era heaviness, if that floats yer boat."
4,Classic stuff,"Upon the first riff all I kept things is ""GODDAMN!"" It's like it's 1973 all over again and Black Sabbath was making the next Master of Reality. Sleep takes the production values of the aforementioned record and further exploits slower tempos & jamming that feels focused for the most part. Occasionally getting carried away with meandering here and there for the most part this cd feels like a breath of fresh air from the early 90's perspective. It feels vintage but done in way that's playing homage to what was so cool about early stoner rock like Sabbath, Cream perhaps Humble Pie and gives a lower tuned doomier feel...Great stuff. Stand out track: ""Dragonaut"""
3,Absolutely Indispensible!,"After collecting and sudying jazz for several years, I finally bought a copy of Rusts discography. Let me say it is amazing in its scope and depth. It should be in any jazz record collectors library. Rust has done an amazing job in putting it together. It also includes many important pre-jazz and 'hot' entries as well, which is handy! A must for any jazz record collector or enthusiast."
4,AN ADEQUATE RENDITION,"This is an amended review, replacing my previous pan of this CD. Upon relistening I realize I was listening too loud, attempting to get more than was realistically possible.Leaving aside the question as to where to properly place and rate this work in the pantheon of Shostakovich symphonies, the performance here is first rate: I have heard other performances that I like equally well, but this one will do just fine. When it comes to the audio, this was recorded at a rather low level, no doubt to prevent overloading during the final loud passages. It might well have benefited from a bit of gain-riding by the engineer at the end, to bring the overall record level up a bit. Before I had cranked my headphone amp up high enough that it ran into clipping during the coda. Be warned. Too much gain will result in things going wrong at the end, if you are not careful. Live recordings have their advantages and their liabilities."
4,Take Me Home - Surprisingly fun!,"Take Me Home was a surprise. I thought it would be okay, and I love romantic comedies. This was much more humorous and interesting than I expected, and I would watch it again."
2,"Boring, silly, humorless","Despite the appearance of accolades and novelty, this film is insufferably boring from start to finish. Character development is tepid; humor is forced; plot is weak. Although many of the reviews I read on this film prior to purchasing were (perhaps overly) positive, in this instance I was totally misled. Considering the amount of positive feedback, I suspect that there are many fans of small budget indie films who will enjoy this movie. Sadly, I am not one of them and I would caution anyone thinking about renting this film: try renting from your local library."
1,Boring :( surprised that people liked it!,"The movie lacked everything: plot, acting, drama, humor! Please don't waste your time watching it; it was a drag. I had to force myself to finish the movie..."
3,girley movie,I just keep thinking this movie was going become real good but NO. no no no no no no no hell no!
2,Insipid and Preposterous,"This movie was a sorry waste of time with flat characters and an implausible plot. In contrast, the soundtrack is very listenable. Skip the movie."
4,Good homey movie,"I liked this movie. I really was just renting it to see what it was about, and I ended up liking it more than I figured. The likehood of someone getting in a cab and driving that far is definately not going to happen, but itwas funny the adventures they had along the way. It is a good movie to watch on the couch with dinner and enjoy"
5,Had to watch it again,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. When you read the description, you think, ""Ok, that will be fair."" But there were SEVERAL plot turns that caught me completely off guard, and that is something that doesn't happen with today's movies. Very enjoyable. it's not an ""action"" flick, so at times it seems a bit slow...but that's when they throw you with something unexpected."
5,refreshing,"It was so nice to see a movie with acting not just special effects. Great acting, great story, great directing. This is a clean good movie that you can feel comfortable referring to a friend. It is amazing that hollywood can't figure out how to make good movies like this anymore. I can't say enough good about the movie. I wish this could have been a box office hit, it deserved so much more. If it only had the distribution, PR and hype that other movies get I am sure it would have done well.This is the best movie I've seen in a long time. If you are tired of the cookie cutter remakes, try this movie for a refreshing breath of fresh air!"
4,Very cute!,"This is a classic comedy situation: two people with clashing personalities get stuck together on a cross-country journey with a variety of delays and setbacks. Why is this one so good?The plot is not particularly original, and the scenes are not incredibly original, creative or surprising. There are some holes in the plot--but they can be ignored well enough. However, the acting is fantastic and the characters are appealing--both the lead actors have great comedic timing. The little surprises in plot and dialogue are cute and funny. The characters are realistic and you like them both equally. The filming, editing, and music are done very well.We found ourselves chuckling out loud quite a bit during the movie, and when it ended, it left us feeling good and happy. We were quite surprised to see one of the scenes shot in a parking lot near our small town in SE Ohio. Small world! But we got a kick out of that!"
3,Interesting,"I like movies that aren't something I've seen before. This fits that bill. However, I had trouble relating to either character who both seemed to have problems handling what appear to be pretty straight forward life choices."
3,Okay,"Interesting premise if one felt it could actually happen but it didn't ""suspend disbelief"" for me as a story should. Some moments....some unnecessary scenes....watch it on sale night."
3,If you watch the movie backwards,"If you watch the movie backwards, it's about a woman who leaves a man (who's progressively leaves the friend zone) & travels great lengths so that she can be with her faithful husband."
3,A little flat but worth 130 minutes,interesting plot that could of resulted in a deeper performance by the two leads with more interesting depth. All in all it is worth an hour and a half and as a result you will not regret it.
2,Forget it,This movie wasn't very funny. In fact the funniest and best parts were watching the trailer. I wouldn't rent it.
5,What a find!,"I am always amazed when I find a gem on Netflix. This was a real diamond!Funny, sad, romantic... all the reasons we go to the movies.Sorry it didn't get seen by a lot more people.It beats the ""big"" name romantic films out in the theaters, no contest."
1,YOU ARE NOT GETTING 15 DVD's!!! ONLY 5,"THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY SAY IT IS!!I ordered 15 DVD's on a spindle like the description said and the picture showed. What I received was 5 DVD's in slimline cases. I wish I had read the review with, ""When I called the seller, they told me Amazon made a mistake when they put the item on their website. Their only remedy was to return the item for a refund, they would not honor the order as ordered."" before this point."
4,The Whatever Happened To Dept.,"Another major talent adrift in a sea of obscurity, Willie Nile's eponymous debut album is nothing short of a revelation. Mix in equal parts Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and Nils Lofgren, and what you get are Nile's celebratory tales of life and love, all delivered in his trademark reedy tenor and supported by a crackling rockin' band. ""Vagabond Moon"" kicks this album off with a bang, just a wonderful, melodic, straight ahead rock and roll song, nothing more and nothing less. No studio gimmicks are evident and the entire album has a one-take feel to it. What puzzles me however is why this CD pressing fails to include the album's best tune,""I'm Not Waiting,"" present on both the vinyl and first CD pressing. Loses one star for that reason only."
5,Once Upon a Time Scratch & Sniff Book,"This book is breathtakingly illustrated by Eloise Wilkin and is a must-have for scratch and sniff book collectors! The scents included are pine, pumpkin pie, brown bread, gingerbread house, honeysuckle and strawberry tarts, and are WONDERFUL! You'll love reading this one to your kids, and they'll love associating timeless childrens' stories with yummy scents!"
4,A Sweet Book,"I bought this book for my grandson who really enjoyed its message. I think it spoke to him about being left out, etc. and how to deal with those feelings."
4,"Cute earrings, perfect for toddlers","I'm always looking for cute earrings with screw backs. These are really adorable but, a little thing, they bend easily. The good thing is, they're easy to bend back (into place)!"
3,William Baldwin as Eye Candy,"Not a great day for lesbians in film, the the two women have little depth. William Baldwin is delicious as the hustler."
2,Lots of broken rice!,"I was disappointed that Santo Tomas Paella Rice had a high percentage of broken rice pieces. Broken rice cooks faster than intact rice, so this offering of Santo Tomas Paella Rice resulted in a mushy consistency. At first Santo Tomas seems a bargain, but add in shipping costs and you'll get better for the same price. You can find alternative rice for Paella on Amazon for $2.95 (16 oz.).C & F Arroz Valencia Short Grain Rice for Paella, 1 lb. Or look at your supermarket for Arroz Valenciano or Arroz Perla from Iberia or Goya. Both offer a better quality of rice than Santo Tomas."
4,"Good, if you are a beginner.","Most of the Lojban tutorials on the internet seem to cater to people who really know what they're getting into. This one, while based on an electronic one to which it does bear obvious resemblance, seems to be a little better for beginners. Lord knows that Lojban needs it, as it is very different from any other language other than Loglan, its predecessor.I feel that the book is not as visually appealing as it could be. It is a textbook at heart, though (I can't see any school carrying it), so this is forgivable. I recommend this book if you want to invest in a physical medium to teach you Lojban. It is a rewarding language to learn, but I have gotten by just fine with online tutorials and knew the language somewhat well before I ever checked out this book."
5,Great Book!,This is a informative book for children who like ballet! Great pictures that show how to practice at home and what ballet classes look like.
5,Amazing stethoscope,"I had a falling-out with my old stethoscope (A DGR Trimline) and after having a great experience borrowing a co-worker's ADC, I figured I would try out their cardiology stethoscope. I was amazed at how high quality these are for the price! Nice, thick tubing that blocks out a lot of background noise and has great sound isolation. They might not be quite as good as a Littman Cardiology III, but I honestly couldn't tell a difference."
2,Littman V. Adscope,"I'm a med student. this scope is NOT as good as the littman cardio III.I listened to both of them for nearly an hour, and also had friends who knew nothing about stethoscopes listen to them. We ALL agreed that the cardio III was much louder and clearer. This scope is also heavier than the littman, with obnoxiously thick tubing. I wish i could have tried the other ADC scopes, but the 601 is NOT the way to go. So, there is a reason why all your colleagues own the 3M scopes...In summary, this is half the price of a littman, but only half as loud, and half as clear.Yes, i returned it, and ordered the littman a few hours later.Hope this helps"
5,Good,"Love this. Fits great, hear great. I can differentiate lower and high pitched sounds. Murmurs are as easy as with that other expensive brand. I've been a nurse for 24 years, and don't buy the name brand anymore. I hear just as good with this. No complaints here!"
2,Goes right by me,"I've tried to read Lindsey Davis several times, and I just can't get interested in these books. I finally managed to finish Silver Pigs after two attempts, and have made two tries to read this one. But it just doesn't hold my attention.The problem is that her writing is choppy and does not flow smoothly. The plot lurches from one scene to another without much logic, and the appeal of the wisecracking Falco character is more than offset by a plot that is, frankly, hard to follow. These books are supposed to be light reading, but I find myself having to flip back constantly to find out who so-and-so is, and why Falco is doing thus-and-such, and it just gets to be too much of a chore.I love Steven Saylor's Gordianus series, and John Maddox Roberts's SPQR stories, but the Falco series just leaves me cold. I am mystified as to why there are so popular."
3,Just a continuation of Book 1: Silver Pigs,"I loved reading 'Silver Pigs,' Book 1, of The Marcus Didius Falco Series: a new, fresh twist on the classic historical fiction. However, 'Shadows in Bronze,' Book 2, was a plot continuation of Book 1. Falco was still a fun character to follow in 'Shadows...', and Helena and his relationship advances through more downs and ups. Still, I was hoping for a completely different ""mystery"" for Falco to solve and was disappointed with 'Shadows...' a 'Silver Pigs' sequel. The Kindle edition had very few typos; navigation worked well. I will try the third book in this series and pray for a new story line."
3,Not My Usual Fare,"I quite enjoyed Silver Pigs (the first book in the series), and expected to enjoy this one, but I was disappointed. Yes, I read the book, but it's not a mystery in the true sense of the word. The villain was apparent all the way through. The book is more like a Romantic history than a mystery, and that's not my cup of tea. I was recommended this author by Amazon as well, and thought I had a winner of a series after I read Silver Pigs, but I'm not so sure now. I find the reading a bit difficult since Falco is almost ""too precious"" for words. He appears to take nothing seriously (except his ladylove Helena, and even that is touch and go). I did enjoy the history, and the travel log of the countyrside in Ancient Rome. I will try one more in the series to see if the fun of Silver Pigs is recaptured."
2,Could be Better.,"Although the aethetics of the book are pleasing, this book was, in my opinion, not meant for the DIY person. ... It lacks some of those details that would allow the DIY person to complete a great project. It kind of breazes through a lot of what should be details. It seems to be a lot of fluff and not much meat. Great coffee table book because of the great imagery. I'm sorry that I would not recommend this book to anyone who is a DIYer. ..."
5,"This is a Great, informative book","This book gives realistic, practical information along with believable suggestions. I have been building and have done cement work for many years, feeling I have done an excellent job. This book has several tips I can apply to make my projects even better."
5,"Trend for ""high end"" homes","Beautiful & informative book. Concrete countertops are in great demand, particularly in the San Francisco Bay area, and are reflective of the ""earthiness"" predominant in so many homes. This book gives all the details as well as references to designers and fabricators. Credit needs to be given to Jud Smith who was a fabricator for Cheng Designs and is pictured throughout the book demonstrating his craftmanship."
5,Great info & pics to inspire,"Gives you enough information and ideas to create a great concrete countertop. I have not started the pour process yet, but I have made my form for a fireplace hearth. Once I try that, I'll decide if I'm up to making the countertops!!"
4,great info,This book really goes through all the important steps. And pictures are worth a million words..The were very helpful...I highly suggest purchasing this book.
4,Good help,"A friend and I have complete our first small project using concrete for furniture.This book helped provide some insights to issues we had not thought of.Some of the details of the technology may be improved on but the emphasis of designand quality form building is dead nuts on!Updating using a bit more of the current 'green' additives might be nice (ground slag,flyash ... both help reduce the amount of portland cement needed), possibly using moremonofilimant nylon rather than so much steel ... but those are just my opinion.The book is a good reference in helping my friend and I learn more and expand our useof concrete. I would purchase this book again."
3,o.k.,"This book is o.k. for the do it yourself person who has some previous experience, but not for the novice."
4,Concrete,Good basic primer on counter top technique. Well illustrated with detailed photographs. If you want to do it yourself this is a great start!
3,"Gorgeous, but no hint where to buy needed materials","Although most authors who seem to dabble in multiple crafts just long enough to sell books on each subject, I am admittedly partial to Marie Browning, who always adds innovative and elegant touches to everything she does -- and buy each of her books as soon as they're written. This book is equally wonderful. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it doesn't give any hint where to buy any of the materials -- which sure aren't available anywhere near me. Likewise, some of her descriptions are very skimpy if you're going to have to search for the item(s). Nevertheless, the gorgeous photographs and clear directives make this well worth the purchase price. Although I'm not sure what a Japanese lantern is (and even the many-paged instructions didn't make that clear), the variety is extensive (from sachets to lampshades, boxes, picture frames, picture mats, cards, and a zillion things in between), and everything shown is gorgeous."
5,Excellent Resource Book,"This book is well written, and has many excellent ideas. The directions are thorough and easy to follow. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in creating with parchment and/or vellum."
1,yikes!,"wow - I just read this book to my son (almost four and adopted) and was so upset at myself that I didn't read it first! I should know this by now! When we got to the page where the mother bird says, ""I will not let you back in to this next unless you promise to obey all the rules,"" my son said, ""would you ever say that to me?"" UGH! Of course I gave him a hundred kisses and reassured him that I would NEVER say that to him. It won't say in our house and I can't even loan it to others. So, to the recyling bin it goes. Bummer."
1,"Not for adopted, orphaned, or step-kids!","I was shocked at the ending-Stellaluna is reunited with her birth family. That never happens to adopted or orphaned children, nor do stepchildren ever see their original family reunited. I'm not sure who this book is for-I don't see anything in it that children who have never ""lost"" a parent can identify with. For children that have ""lost"" a parent, the book just reinforces magical thinking. There are too many other great books out there-skip this one."
5,School Book Review,Did you ever see a bat? I did. I read a book about a bat who got lost and had to eat worms every day. It's called Stellaluna by Janell Cannon. An owl attacked a mother bat and her baby Stellaluna got lost. Now the baby bat is trying to find her mother. I like the picture when Stellaluna teaches the birds how to be a bat by hanging upside down. I also like when the birds learn how to fly. From reading this story I learned that if I ever get lost I will never give up trying to find my way home. I think you should read this book to see if Stellaluna and her mother will ever find each other and this way home.
5,Stellaluna,Stellaluna is a book that anyone can relate to. She must act like something she's not and we've all been in that situation. All in all it is a great story.
5,As sweet as ever,I remember when this book first came out and had the little stuffed animal with it. The story was so sweet and charming then and remains so today. Got this for a baby shower gift for a former children's book seller who was thrilled this was the book I picked.
4,A beautiful book for children!,I bought this for my grandchildren. We enjoy the bats in our back yard and have named one the Louieville Slugger. Now another one has been named Stellaluna. This is one of the main requested books they want read to them. We always have fun and lively discussions about bats and how different and helpful they are.
5,You will not regret buying this book!,This was one of my favorite books as a child. Now I can share it with my baby. It has beautiful illustrations and tells a heart warming story. You will not regret getting this for your child or as a gift.
4,Good book,"This is a good book. Nice illustrations and enjoyable for my preschooler. It is a bit of a long book for very little kids however, but overall a frequently chosen selection from our library."
5,A Sweet and Engaging Book,"My boys love this book! They loved it so much I bought the CD-ROM book as well. And the plush bat! They enjoy hanging Stellaluna upside down while reading the story.The story itself is a little scary when the owl appears and Stellaluna is separated from her mother in the dark forest. But the mother bird and her babies are quick to accept and help Stellaluna. The story emphasizes that differences should be celebrated and accepted, and it's always best to just be yourself. It also shines a positive spotlight on an animal that gets a bad rap--the bat. I'd rate this book better than Cannon's other book, which is about snakes, ""Verdi.""The artwork is beautiful; I love simply looking at the pages. And the ""Bat Notes"" section at the end is informative; I know because my pre-reading child wanted me to read it out loud several times!Lovers of nature, superb artwork, and literature will not be disappointed reading this story to their little ones."
5,One of my daughter's favorites,"Stellaluna is both well-written and lavishly illustrated -- a delight for the young child to view and the older child (as well as the parent) to read -- a rarity among picture books. . My three-year-old has had this book since birth, and has loved it since day one, asking for it to be read over and over.The story: We follow the young fruit-bat, Stellaluna, through her ordeal of becoming lost and her subsequent upbringing by a family of birds. The resultant bat-bird behavior confuses Stellaluna, but will delight your child with its absurdity. The story contains good conflict resolution, as Stellaluna regains her bat identity and her family, something sure to comfort and teach your child.For further entertainment, I highly recommend Ms. Cannon's book, VERDI ( a similar tale about a green python; wonderfully written and well-illustrated), as well as the CD-ROM edition of STELLALUNA produced by Living Books (one of the few really GOOD CD-ROMs for children)."
2,not up to specs,"I was very disappointed with this lens. It has a very cheap feel and the image quality was terrible. I was only able to test it with my Canon 20d and not with film. I couldn't believe how lousy it was, I had read some other reviews and they seemed positive. I tried it on a tripod and shot a variety of things text and 3-D objects and never could pull a sharp photo. I noticed that I had to use a lot more unsharp mask than normal to be useable. I tend to use primes a lot and so maybe I expected to much."
4,very good lens - underrated,"I had been using the 24-85 for years on a series of Canon DSLRs starting with the original d30 and culminating with the 5d. Finally decided to spring for the 24-105L. I was immediately surprised that pix from the new lens didn't look so great as 3-4X higher price would suggest. Detailed comparisons showed the 24-85 was just as good in many instances. One edge (not the other) of the 24-105L was a bit better, but center sharpness was no better, even wide open. Contrast seemed equally good. I returned the 24-105L to the dealer and kept the 24-85. While it's true the zoom range is less, I also like the much lighter weight and more compact form of the 24-85."
4,Worth watching,"Not sure why this film didn't get better reviews. Based on William Trevor's novel of the same name, it's beautifully cast and very well done. Definitely worth a second look."
4,Romantic Tragedy,"This story is beautifully filmed in Ireland. However, it does take some tragic turns, starting out as the story of a young boy who looses many closest to him. He becomes an adult then meets his beautiful cousin and initially, fails to make her his own, although it appears that he loves her. (In between is the Irish revolution and the detested ""Black and Tans"".) The cousins both mature and see the mistakes they have made, with the help of a priest and a former family servant."
2,little book of fluff,I have been considering opening a salon for several years and have now decided to take the next step and actually do it. I was excited to see this book because it looked like exactly what I needed but overall I was disappointed. The material in this book is VERY basic. It would be appropriate for someone with NO knowledge of the beauty industry or business in general. Anyone who has any industry knowledge or who has done even the most basic research will find nothing new here. Much of the information is basic business knowledge that I hope most people contemplating opening a business would already have. There are a few helpful hints but they are buried in the fluff that constitutes the majority of this book - and it isn't even a big book.
4,Salon Startup,I am in the process of starting a business and this book was a great resource. It helped me get right to the point. I also used in conjuction with this book Six-Week Start up by Rhonda Abrams. Both of these books made great complements to each other in making the right moves in the early stages of starting my business.
2,From back cover:,"Hannah Blackstone's little girl had been kidnapped, but no one was willing to help her. No one except Quinn McDermott.Hannah hardly knew more than his name, but all that mattered was that her mysterious new neighbor had taken her in, when most others would have turned her in. Life had taught Hannah not to trust, but Quinn, with his quiet concern and unrelenting resolve, made it all too easy to try. Every second with him brought Hannah closer to finding her little girl... and losing her heart to the sexy stranger by her side."
5,The best travel guide for this region.,"Photographing the Southwest is the best travel guide. Before our 11 days trip to Southern Utah we looked through many books and guides around, but after all this one was our major source of information about unique and interesting places. The information is accurate and completely reliable. Advices are extreamly valuable and usefull.The only suggestion I can make is to add maps. Just simple low-detail map with reference to each place could be very helpfull.But again, overall it is simply the best."
5,Go with a camera in one hand and this book in the other,"Martres's two books on photographing the Southwest are remarkably useful, sensible, and affordable. He keeps his directions--both geographic and photographic--brief, relevant, and precise. Even if you don't take a camera, these books can help you reach remarkable places of which may never or only vaguely have heard of. I even enjoy just ""armchair travelling"" with these books."
4,Solid Shoe,This shoe is well made and solid. It feels like I can wear them anywhere and will last a while. The only problem I am having with them is that I have a bunion on my left foot that is inconveniently being pushed on by the shoe. I am breaking them in a bit each day and hope that the area will stretch a bit. They are best for narrow-ish feet although my feet are not super wide to begin with.
2,Size is a problem,"I have had an identical pair (same size, 9M, and colour) of these for four years and loved them. These new sandals are 1cm shorter and 6-7mm narrower than the old ones and feel too tight. The size difference is not a matter of breaking in and a little stretching that may occur, it is far greater than that. I'm concerned that new ones will not be comfortable to wear for long periods as the old ones are. I cannot see how Keen could allow such poor quality control."
5,one tuff sandal,"This is one tuff sandal. I walk 7 dogs twice a day through all sorts of conditions and this sandal stands up to it all. But the best thing about it is it's comfort. When these wear out, I'm going to buy another pair."
3,Definitely not their best album,"""Selfless"", their Sony-financed album with a high quality sound, is musically a really one-dimensional affair. The album suffers from songs that sound much too similar and the closing track ""Go spread your wings"" lasts for over 23 mins. without any climax or interesting parts. Far more interesting is the ""Merciless""-EP included in this US-only 2-CD-Set. It contains studio outtakes and remixes from the ""Pure""-sessions and offers a very diversified sound from brutal guitar-attacks and lashing drums to almost ambient-like soundscapes."
5,Wonderful!,"I enjoyed this second book in Katherine Kurtz's trillogy of Deryni novels. It was very dramatic, suspenseful, and extremely entertaining. Kurtz does a skillful job of blending midevil court life, the Catholic church, and magic into a gripping novel with a stunning conclusion that sent me after the final book in the trillogy, The Quest for Saint Camber."
5,Educational and Thorough,"One of the most thorough books on government and its workings I've come across. Mr. Edwards is as good a researcher as he is a writer. A+ work.Dr. Henry R. ToofCambridge, MA"
3,Mint Oil,"Just be aware this is mint flavored oil. Anything you put it in will be oily as it does not dissolve. May be fine for cooking, but not so good for flavoring drinks and such."
2,for pitchshifter diehards only,"this is a pretty interesting EP, but will probably only appeal to diehard pitchshifter fan who needs every single EP, remix, single that this awesome band has ever put out. along the same lines as the couple of remix albums that fear factory did back in the 90s, in that the remixes are interesting but not really as good as the originals."
4,Fr. Amorth's experience is a lesson for us.,"Fr. Amorth, having devoted his life to fighting the forces of the devil, writes this book to remind us that the devil is indeed real, but at the same time can act only as God allows him to. One flaw in the book to watch out for: Fr. Amorth includes the tetimony of a former victim of possession who refers to his pilgrimages to Medjugorgie, yet Father says nothing to correct this. All in all though, an excellent work."
5,A MUST READ,"Wow. Double wow. I always knew that demons existed, and knew they caused us trouble, but have never read any actual accounts of their meddling. This book is absolutely incredible. And, the fact that the author worked for the Vatican as an exorcist lends him great credibility. He's not just some wacko out there. This book is not scary; instead it's an intellectual look at how demons possess or oppress people. I learned so much and walked away from this book not afraid, but empowered. God gives us the tools to fight them, and will only allow what is in his will. How anybody can deny the presence of Satan and demons is beyond me. Take a read, and you'll be blown away by this book."
4,Down-to-Earth commentary by a Catholic priest-exorcist,"A long-awaited commentary by a Catholic priest who is the Chief Exorcist of the Diocese of Rome, and who has performed hundreds of exorcisms over many years. This book has been a European best seller, which should attest to its validity and value to those who want a true picture of deliverance and exorcism in Spiritual Warfare today. The translation from the Italian has been wonderfully done, and the text reads virtually like it was done originally in English. I have read scores of books on the subject, often with conflicting viewpoints and advice. I believe Fr. Amorth has offered sound, down-to-Earth theory and advice based on years of experience, and would highly recommend it as a valuable addition to any library on the topic."
2,Un-inspiring,"Fr. Amorth comes across as a very sincere, devout and orthodox ecclesiastic. He warns the readers about the danger and theologicall shortsightedness of ignoring or dismissing demonic possesssions. Agreed. He mentions several times in his book the work of Fr. Candido Amantini, a Passionist priest and exorcist who was his ""mentor"". While I feel very happy and greaful for Fr. Amorth's ministry and service to the Church, I also feel that his narrative (resulting from years of experience)is boring and uneventful and that his exorcisms were not as dramatic and tragic as Fr. Candido's (luckily for him!). I recommend readers who want to read about exorcisms and demonic possessions to read Malachi Martin's ""Hostage to the Devil"". The contrast between Martin's and Amorth's narratives is very palpable."
4,Timely,"The disturbing revival and rise of astrology, magic and paganism calls for a thoughful response to what many people see as just silly and harmless hobbies. Fr. Amorth is very explicit in his details of the causes and evolution of possession. Demonic possession is clearly not a cinematic invenion nor a misunderstanding of mental ilnesses. Fr. Amorth describes his bewildered frustration with those of the heirarchy and laity who wish to ignore the subject. It is obvious that Fr. Amorth's first calling is pastoring and exorcising as he jumps around and back-tracks unnecessarily. However this a must read for those interested in solutions to growing demonic influence."
2,Weak,"As a good and true Catholic, I believe in the reality of demonic possession and in the authority and power of the Church to exorcise demons from those people they plague and torment. Having said that, however, I'm disappointed in the books I've read on exorcism. Putting myself in the shoes of a skeptic, I know how uncomfortable, embarrassed, and unpersuaded I'd be by these efforts. Father Amorth's book is no exception. Granted, it may be partly the fault of the amateurish writing (or the translation), but the good Father comes across as, well, rather silly. I'm sure he's not, but that's the impression with which I'm left.Furthermore, Father Amorth is clearly an adherent of the charismatic movement within the Catholic Church. In the interests of full disclosure, I must say that this movement is not at all my cup of tea; I consider it far more Protestant than Catholic.Not recommended."
5,Thanks!,I received the book right of way and although I haven't started reading it yet I'm excited to add it to my book collection.
5,An Exorcist Tells His Story,Amazing book! It changed totally my life. I thank almighty God to revel us the truth trough this holy man. I even have a plan to meet this holy man in Rome. God bless!
4,A wake up call to the simplicity of evil.,"A fascinating expose of the simplicity of evil in our everyday experiences. Clarifies our understanding of ""The Fall"" and the helpfulness of good angels as opposed to the nastiness of fallen ones. I have a much better understanding of the source of peoples unhappiness...A very helpfull book although sometimes repetitive. An excellent guide as to how better to pray for ones own protection and for others - A very well worth read."
1,Technical manual,"This book was not what I was looking for, an insight into various ways support groups work. It reads like an Army Technical Manual, dry and uninspiring. At least I paid only $1.98 for it!"
1,Buyer Beware,"The tape made by MPI is a World War II documentary, and NOT the classic 1936 movie starring Lew Ayres and Isabell Jewell. The 1936 movie was also released under the name ""The Marines have Landed"" as well as the original name ""The Leathernecks have Landed"". The MPI tape shows a picture of marine in WWII battle dress, so it can be easily distinguished from the 1936 classic. If you want the 1936 movie Nostalgia Family Video has it available in a fuzzy VHS transfer. If you want a WWII film, this film has lots of shots from that era, but it should be listed separately from the 1936 movie."
2,Bad movie. Great fun watching.,"The one scene from this movie that sticks out for me, is when Christie's friend gets hit by the car. The doctor comes out from surgery and curtly says...""I'm sorry, your daughter is dead.""Damn, no compassion. No tact. No sympathy.Hilarious!!!"
2,Awful but Compulsively Watchable,"Do yourself a favor and check this one out. It is the most hilariously bad movie ever created. ""Death Wish"" 1/2/3 auteur Michael Winner outdoes himself with the terrible actors and way overblown musical score by Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones. (if you thought Jimmy Pages DW2 score was distracting, you ain't heard nothin' yet, folks). This is one so-bad-it's-good film that begs for a remake."
1,Shoudn't be listed under Gospel,Not sure why this is listed under the search word gospel.Yes Earl is funny but Amazon this needs to be re-classified. Thanks much
5,Sleeping Better!,"I love this product because it helps me sleep. I fall asleep easily but have been waking up at 1, 2 or 3am regularly for 20 years. I have tried everything from reflexology to HRT and nothing helps as much as this. Right now I take 500mg of L-Tryptophan and 3mg Melatonin. When I add this to the mix, I actually get 7-8 hours of very restful sleep."
1,Very small and soft !,"I am big fan of Prada bags, but this bag is very disappointing! Firstly, the bag is too small and it does not sit up straight. The handles are too heavy for the body of the bag!! The only plus point I like about this bag is the various colours it comes in!"
3,Leadbetter's voice is annoying,"The content is very good which makes it all the more annoying that it is so difficult to listen to this man speak. He has what sounds like an Australian accent ... high pitched and nasal. It was very windy during much of the filming and you can see how hard he is struggling to appear composed and in control despite everything flapping in the wind. Others in the video, a student and Leadbetter's wife (who shows us how women should hit (sexist)), are stiff and awkward though likeable. It's probably time to update this useful video and somehow make the voice easier on the ears."
3,Good book for beginner,"This is a good book for the bigenner golfer, it was made a while back no HD video but still not bad."
3,Beginner to Winner,"Good dvd for the price, does not go into much detail in the different area's of the golf game."
1,poor copy quality,This is not an original copy and is difficult to watch because the voice is not in sync and the overall image is fuzzy. Both faults make it too distracting to watch which is very disappointing.
5,Well worth the money,Full of very good drills and tips on how to fix flaws and build better fundamentals. I also have the Hank Haney 3 club tour and they are similar but offering a different perspective.
3,Haunted house,"Haunted house horror yarn set in the 1930s.Marianne Faithfull plays an institutionalized woman.Still, worth seeing for the original story line.""Madhouse Mansion"" may not frighten you, but it offers mild amusement if you don't take it as seriously as the film seems to take itself."
4,A good book for children to read although the story is a bit disjointed,"This colorful book based on the characters in the comic strip ""Peanuts"" is a good book for young people learning to read. However, the story line is a bit disjointed. Snoopy is once again taking on the Red Baron, but bounces back and forth between his imaginative adventures as a World War I flying ace and reality. There is a caption of the imagination followed by a caption of reality. Therefore, it lacks some of the charm of the other stories where the imaginative tale is developed over several captions. The artwork of the images is colorful and eye-catching."
5,Love this CD!,"Wow this is some really cool stuff, and very well recorded. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who loves Rockabilly or Psychobilly, and if you don't know what that is, no matter, buy the CD you'll love it. It's up beat, positive, and fun as hell!"
2,bracelet,"I never ordered this item, never received it and have never even seen it's picture. Where do these items come from? I have received several request to rate items I have never ordered. However, it's cute."
1,An Expensive Advertisement,"This book has a very elementary introduction to hiring with very little focus on the child care industry. It appears to be primarily a vehicle for the author to sell expensive pre-employment screening tests and thus the author has left all of the meat out of the book. There is one good section on performance appraisals, but again they are not specifically related to child care and can be found in better general books on hiring."
4,Perfect pop from Richard Barone and the band,"I bought the Numbers With Wings EP back in the new wave days. I still have it and play it every once in a while. It's still great, melodic pop. This two-fer also contains the Beat Hotel album, which is not as consistent as Numbers With Wings, but still pretty good. ""Brave New World"" is one of my faves from the album.Their first album, ""Drums Along The Hudson,"" might have been a better choice to package with Numbers With Wings. It was raw, weird, quirky, and darn good. The production of Drums was pretty bare-bones compared to Numbers and Beat Hotel, but the unique songs (most of them very short) make up for it. Some of it sort of reminds me of stuff like ""Killing An Arab"" by the Cure. If you can get Drums cheap, snatch it up."
5,Very Nice,My 4 year old daughter loves this book. She loves all of the colors and the words. She likes to just sit and look through it when Im not reading it to her. Its very catchy and has great truths about Jesus.
5,Terrific book,"This book comes with a CD. The songs are very inspirational and sung by Crystal Lewis and a few children. Very well done. Also, the A to Z portion is read like a book on CD so you and your child can listen and read along - a wonderful bonding opportunity, not to mention helping children step into reading using God's Word."
2,Bland start but gets better,"The WildCATs (Covert Action Team) are a group of heroes trying to protect the Earth from a race of shape-shifting aliens.Written and illustrated by Jim Lee this book reprints the earliest appearances of the Wildcats from the very first wave of Image comics.The results are... pretty bland.Wildcats, like Youngblood, Cyberforce, Wetworks and other groups I've forgotten all felt like more extreme violent versions of the X-Men. In these early Wildcats stories the cast are little more than 'cool' names, powers and guns. Most of them don't even get a civilian name or appear out of costume.Lee's art is the one strong point but even it suffers from garish colors and busy character designs. And he relies far too much on two-page spreads to cut down on the number of panels he has to draw.Later the Wildcats would get some depth under writers like Alan Moore and Chris Claremont but in this book they're just not that interesting."
3,Has anyone actually fillied up there entire memory?,It just seems like a lot of memory to me. I dought anyone has that many cds to fill this thing up. I suggest a 15 or 20 GB model instead. I mean if you are just adding songs as you go you're being optimistic because an iPods battery only lasts about 1.5 years. And by the time you do fill up yuor iPod they'll have allready come out with a new form of it anyway. So save the extra money and buy a cheaper and less memory holding model.
2,Just another mp3 player,"This has to be one of the most overrated products on the market. Wow, a nasty screen that looks worse than an old game boy, with limited functionality. For around the same money, buy an Archos av340. These things store mp3s, store computer files, (making it a removable hard drive), record and edit video, and much more. Use the Archos, (or similar product) with your Tivo and you have Tivo to go. I have millions of Ren and Stimpy cartoons and movies with my mp3s now. If you think they are too bulky, buy a cheap workout mp3 player to take to the gym. For $500, don't let Apple laugh all the way to the bank. You can't even upload songs off of your Ipod, for $500???? Thats just insane. I am burning dvds to my Archos, and then sending the signal out to tvs and monitors at work and school.Ipods are all hype. Look at what personal multimedia units offer for LESS money in some cases, and you will switch."
1,a library in your hands but...,"This is a fantastic machine. I have one 5GB and the 40GB sounds a bit better, more volume,etc.A serious problem...Battery goes down very fast if you have 37GB library already complete."
1,Harddrive died in 6 month and Apple won't replace it with a,"After 6 month of sitting on my desk ( I don't travel with it, I just use it as my music player at my place, the harddrive just died, Write error ).The Apple support gave me the only alternative as a refurbish; they should replace it with a brand new one if they really care about Steve Job's style of business; breaking down after 6 months is not what Apple's name stands for."
2,Hyped Up.,"I wonder how they can sell these things with the battery life of about 2 hours?Oh, but what about when it crashes and locks up? REBOOT.I would check out the others first before I invest in this."
5,Wonderful. Perfect. I'm in love.,"Having access to my entire (and sizable) music collection wherever I go is a dream come true, and the iPod is the perfect vehicle to accomplish this. The user interface on the iPod is perfect, and the integration with iTunes is brilliant. And as for the reviewer who claimed the battery only last one and a half years and is unreplaceable, the former claim is questionable and the latter is false. Replacement batteries can be ordered from Apple directly for $100 or from ipodbattery.com for $50. Enjoy the iPod, a wonderful musical beast."
3,"Unlucky, Perhaps","Since they first came out in 2001, I've bought 3 hard-drive-based iPods. Each performed well, for its day, in sound quality and ease of use. All three, however, failed mechanically just slightly beyond the warranty period. In all, I have sunk over $1,000 into iPods, with nothing left to show for it today. A single buyer's experience is a small sample, of course, and perhaps I was just unlucky. In any event, I decided to cut my losses and bought a hard-drive-based mp3 player of different make. Thus far, after 18 months, the replacement brand has performed flawlessly."
1,Put your money elsewhere,"I have owned an iPod for a little over a month now and still have not gotten it to synch with my PC. I put my faith in the Apple myth that everything always works. The amount of time and money I've put into trying to get it to work I could have put my money elsewhere. Bottom line: Unless you have the time and money to try and make your iPod work, go elsewhere!!!!"
3,iPod Dirty Secert **MUST READ**,"I would just like to tell all of you that iPod has an internal rechargeable battery. Internal means that the battery is deep inside the iPod and is almost impossible to get to. But the kicker is, the battery only lasts 18 months and costs only a little less than the iPod itself($255). If you don't think that is alot and you end up getting it you have to completly take apart your iPod and risk it being broken. If you do that, you will have only had 18 months of listening to tunes for ONLY $755! For a video on all of this go to www.ipoddirtysecert.com Thanks a bunch!"
5,Great item!!!!!!,"I got this item used and it broke in about a week. I sent it to a repair service who charged me almost $300 to replace the hard drive and battery. Not a good start, and I went into ownership with a bad first impression. However, this is a great product. I have nearly half my CD collection downloaded and still have plenty of room for the rest of mine and any of my friends I want. The sound quality is great, the navigation is easy and the design is ingenious. This is something I never knew I wanted but I couldn't live without now. Of course one day I'll upgrade to a newer version, but as long as this one is working well I'll keep using and enjoying it."
5,"terrific, but 40 gigs??","I love my ipod, no doubt about it. But if I had to do it over again, I wouldn't get the 40 gig model. We put our entire combined cd collection on it, plus some books on tape...and only used 1/2 of the memory. I'm sure we'll find something to fill up the space - isn't that they way things work. But honestly, 20 gigs is fine for the ordinary collection."
1,junk,Your better off with a Nomad. I tried 2 ipods and they will only synch with one PC. So if you want to transfer mp3 from pc to another forget this thing.
1,Disaster,"No star!! Dark night ! It never works and no help from Apple website, not even answering emails ,(only Amazon does ) Very bad reference , no care at all for customer service !"
1,Worked for 10 minutes then never again,"Got very excited. Bought the ipod. In the middle of loading the songs, the software froze up. The ""Do not disconnect"" message on the Ipod screen would not go away, even when I turned off the computer. I followed the steps in the manual to do a hard reset but that didn't work either, and now I have [expensive] piece of junk with ""Do not disconnect"" written on it. It is going back to amazon for a refund first thing Monday morning."
1,Overpriced Overhyped,itunes and the Ipod are no match for the Napster service and the Samsung Napster player. Napster and its player has more features and more music to chose from. Go to a bestbuy and compare the two products. Ipod is lame compared to the Napster player
5,I Love This Player !!!!,"Very simple. Bought the RCA 40GB Lyra - piece of crap. Bought the iPod - WOW!! what a fantastic player. Controls are intuitive, can operate easily with one hand. Great accessory list. I have a Kenwood Excelon 869 stereo system in my truck and had considered the Kenwood Music Keg (20GB). I hooked the iPod up to my aux input's and wa-la!! For the same money, I get portability and more storage. You won't regret purchasing the iPod."
1,Not for long distance runners!!!,"Talk about frustration!! What I thought was a really great break through, turned out to be a total nightmare. After 25 minutes the Ipod would either completely stop working all together or just skip repeatedly then stop. I found out that it was designed to ""catch up"" after 25 minutes but it wouldnt even start again most of the time, just freeze up and be completely worthless. Returning it was a even bigger nightmare because no one was able to test it out and see that it would malfunction....I guess if you work for Apple stores you dont run. I had to pay a restocking fee to get rid of this nightmare. NEVER will I purchase another item from Apple. I love my Nomad Muvo that I bought, and couldnt be happier."
2,Trendsetter,"Thirty years of experience was summarised into the first, and one of the more readable, texts dedicated to credit scoring, which is still widely used as a reference work. To the best of my knowledge, Mr. Lewis was working on the book for several years prior to his retirement. It might not go into detail, but it provides a good idea of what the issues were in the 1980s, and early 1990s.While much of the material is now very dated, especially for companies that have a lot of experience with credit scoring. It is, nonetheless, an essential part of any credit scoring library."
2,Interesting cover,"If you have an interest in learning more about the Trojan War and the archeology involved in proving it wasn't a myth, then this isn't the book for you. I'm not sure who this book was written for. I've a feeling there was a good mind behind a pen that couldn't write in this case."
5,A Classic Classicist,"Here's the thing I like about Wood; he gets excited about the little things. It comes through best on the BBC/PBS specials, but when going through the book, you see it shine through as well. He absolutely *loves* what he writes about, and as a result, he's one of the most entertaining authors I've come across.I read this book for one of my mythology classes, and it's one of the few that I kept. It's very well-written, and just utterly fascinating. It's interesting to know just how sophisticated Bronze Age civilizations really were, and that we're not that superior to them after all. Reading about the Hittites made me want to visit Turkey (after hitting Hissarlik, of course!).The best part, though, was an anecdote about a clay tablet found still in an oven, composed by a king calling for assistance from his overlord. Reading the emotions of the writer between the lines, thousands of years after this tablet was made, was incredibly moving.Darn, I love this book."
5,Best quality,"This is a great buy, I must say. The quality of this surge supressor exceeded my expectations and I feel relieved that something this good is quietly protecting my investment(s). Get as many as you can.I will only buy Panamax from now on."
2,Not in Good Shape,This book did not come in good shape as it said it was. The binding was very weak and wasn't holding the book together very well. We were rather disappointed.
5,TH ebest,"This is one of the best rock records of all time. Great metal and great songs, a true masterpiece. I still love it 7 years after I bought it. I'm full of hell."
3,"Come on, let's Death-N-Roll!!!","Compared to ""Left Hand Path,"" ""Wolverine Blues"" is watered-down. It's got all the attitude, but only some of ""Left Hand Path"" brutality, and relatively few memorable moments. The album may be more listenable and have more continuity, but it's rawer, rock-n-roll-death-metal.No song on this album compares to any of the songs on ""Left Hand Path."" But hey, it's a more main-stream commercial-friendly sound. The album has all the signature growly-growl guitar/bass sound and catchy beats, but after days of listening, I don't remember many riffs on the album. Still a very vicious and probably ""influential"" work though. ""Wolverine Blues"" is a MUST-HAVE for fans of The Entombed. I think the band eventually got much better at writing and performing death-n-roll songs on later albums like ""Morning Star"" and ""Inferno""... much better."
3,"Come on, let's Death-N-Roll!!!","Compared to ""Left Hand Path"" this album is a loser. It's got plenty of attitude and brutality, but nothing on it is that memorable. It may be more listenable and have more continuity, but it's much more like raw rock-n-roll-death-metal.No song on this album compares to any of the songs on ""Left Hand Path."" But hey, it's a more main-stream commercial-friendly sound. Still has all the signature guitar/bass sound and catchy beats, but after days of listening, I don't remember a single riff on the album. Still a vicious work though, and a must-have for fans of The Entombed."
4,BANG!,"That was my reaction after hearing one second of ""Rotten Soil"". They come on you and don't stop. This album is hard for me to describe. From the song titles, you would be expecting a death metal band. The music is almost as heavy as some death metal but it is FUN. Don't just walk away, it's MUCH MUCH heavier than 70s party rock but if you find yourself moshing and dancing at the same time, say I told you so. The vocals are semi-screamed. If I were to categorize ""Wolverine Blues"", I would say ""death'n'roll"". It is heavy and comes straight at you but is more accessible than Cannibal Corpse, never mind Nile. That does not mean it isn't heavy. But, just listen because it is not possible for me to describe it further. I have not heard any other Entombed although I have heard great things about ""Left Hand Path""."
4,Bone-Crunching...,"This is some seriously heavy music, a mix between death metal and good old rock 'n' roll; surprisingly, this combination works very well. While the tracks are somewhat similar, they're all good, with the stand-outs being ""Contempt, ""Heavens Die,"" and ""Out of Hand."""
1,The charger doesn't work,"I bought this item, but it didn't work. It doesn't charge my nokia 6682. I then asked for a replacement.They were kind enough to send me a replacement, but even that charger doesn't work.Great service, bad product."
1,cell phone charger not fit,The multifit charger sounds good but was too big to fit into the charger opening on the phone. It would have cost more to return than to buy a new one!
3,Nice to have on the shelf,"I bought this book when my child was first diagnosised with quad cp - during his first year of life. He's now 2.5 years old and has just now reached a point where some of the ideas are useful. Parents of more severely affected children should not expect to get alot of use out of this book early on. Of course, you may not yet know that your child is severely affected early on. But if you find your child cannot do the things suggested in this book - just put it away for reference later. I'm still on the quest for the best book for early on..."
5,Best book,This is the best book on Cerebral Palsy I have ever read. It was sugested by my grandsons therapist. It is a must have!
3,Okay . . but (BIG but) . . . USB is NOT standard . . .,"Sound quality is fine for similar recorders . . only ONE BIG COMPLAINT which is that the USB cable is non-standard and proprietary to Olympus. Most other Olympus digital recorders now use the standard interface, but the DS-2 only ""looks like"" mini-4s and other similar size cables. Still searching for a replacement . . ."
4,Great device,I'm not very technologically savvy but I love this item and am enjoying using it. No problems thusfar.
5,all that and more,"this little device has everything I wanted to replace my old sony cassette recorder and more. controls are easy to use, it's light, easy to download wma files and burn to cd, good sensitivity with the built in microphones. I haven't tried an external mic yet, but for the money, I didn't find anything on the market that came close to this little device.would I use it for professional recording? no. but for quick informal lectures, or concerts where I just want to recall what was played, this unit stands tall."
4,Good buy for the money,"This is a good recorder for the money. Sound quality is good and wma recording format keeps files small.However, due to the lack of a noice cancellation feature, there is some ambient sound. I also own an Olympus DM-10 and the recording quality of that was much better, albeit, I had an addon mic attached. In my recordings with the DS-2, background noises in the lecture room such as chair movements, pencil scribbling, etc could be made out.This is an excellent recorder for a student. But, if you need something very professional, I would recommend spending a bit more for some of the higher end Olympus recorders. I havent tried any others, but I do like my DM-10 a lot."
3,Good but should be better,"We have been using these machines in our medical clinic for 2 years. Overall they work well. The one big problem is when dictating, you cannot back up a few words and hear what was said. It always takes you back to the beginning of the dictation. For this reason alone when we are ready to replace all of these, we will change to a different machine (even if that means changing manufacturers) that will allow this feature. If this missing feature does not bother you, they are good machines otherwise."
4,More on Intel Mac compatibility,"Actually, the DSS Player software that comes with this recorder does work on the new Intel Macs to transfer software from the recorder to the computer via a USB connector using the ""Import File"" command on the file menu. It translates to a wma file automatically, but won't do the translation to mp3 on any Mac as far as I can tell. I too have discovered EasyWMA, which works fine to do the wma to mp3 translation. There's also an application called Switch that works, too.I have used this recorder, with a Radio Shack microphone (33-3013), to record lectures and conferences for several months. The lowest quality/longest time recordings are pretty awful and hard to listen to because of garbled sound, but the HQ setting (monaural, 4.5 hours to fill up the recorder) makes wonderful recordings that sound fine on a CD."
2,INVEST IN DELUXE MODEL,"Problem with this model is that you can't resume dictation on a file after you stop. This is really a stupid limitation, because without that ability, you have to finish your project in one sitting, and can't go back to resume. Only way is to start a new file, which is a PITA. The sound quality is awesome, and makes good audio files for emailing. Stereo capability is rather useless for a device of this nature unless you intend to record your garage band. Ciau. Mike"
4,Great little recorder,"This recorder is great! I am using it to record sermons and then transferring them to our church's website. The quality is great. Got a cheap ($25) lapel mike to plug into the recorder from Radio Shack, and the sound quality is great.I transfer the files to a Mac and while this is not the easiest interface/software package to use to do this, it does just fine. Will export the WMA to an AIFF format. Not hard to find a software package (freeware) to use to convert it to MP3 etc. This is the only real complaint I have and would give Olympus 5 stars if they would package something a bit more Mac friendly.I would recommend this recorder to anyone who wants to get good clear recordings in a digital format."
5,Good Product,"Excellent, I bouth this device for my son, he use it for university class and he is very happy, the voice recorder work fine!!"
3,Frustrating,Hey I got this with the Dragon Naturally Speaking -- and found out I can't even download stuff off the recorder and onto my computer. Hardware problems. Software issues. Delays with customer service. Lack of tech support. Ugghhh! The recorder works fine. It's getting the recordings off the recorder onto my computer that's turned into a challenge.
3,crapy usb cable,The DS2 it'sself is excellent for what I use it for the two problems I have is that since I have a mac the software for the computer is not what you would expect and the USB cable uses a propietery mini usb port but claims to use a normall one so I am having to buy a new cable because I lost the old one even though I have 3 mini usb cables sitting next to me.
1,Poor performance,I gave this as a Christmas gift. When it was tested by the recipient it was found to have very poor sound quality. It was distorted and weak in volume. Amazon refused to provide more than 50% refund as the package had been opened (how else would one know it was defective???). The manufacture has taken it back for repair or replacement after multiple requests for the required return authorization. It is unclear how long this will take or how it will function when returned. I would not buy it again.
2,Software is a bit iffy...,"I have had no problem with the actual recorder. However, the software would not install properly on my Powerbook. I chose the DS-2 because it was supposed to be compatible with PC and Mac, but apparently it is not truly Mac compatible. When I called technical support, they told me they had no other complaints registered and therefore I should call Apple to get help. It should be noted that the software installed perfectly on our desktop PC, but unfortunately, I need the sound files on my Mac. I would recommend trying another product if you're on a Mac."
4,A high frequency wave recorder,This recorder working very well for me.I used this for music instrument very good for high frequency wave but not for low fequency wave like base.
1,Not suitable for medical dictation,"This product does not allow the user to stop, back up and record over previously dictated material. I don't see how this can be used in a medical environment, and am astonished that something like this made it to market. It is actually less functional than audio tape in this regard."
2,DS-2 Not Ready for Vista,I bought two Units for my Daughters in College. Before the purchase I called Olympus to make sure they were fully compatible with Vista and was assured they were. When I loaded the software on the Vista Laptop I kept getting 3 or 4 error messages before the program would load. I reinstalled several times trying to fix it. Nothing worked. I called Olympus again and was told to just close out the error messages each time and the program would work. I was also told that was the best they could do as it hadn't worked with Vista before! A Company as large as Olympus certainly could and should do better.
1,Digital recorder extraordinaire,I'm a freelance technology writer who lives or dies by the ability to record my interviews with chief technology officers and systems administrators of big companies. Having the accuracy of a quote or technical comment is critical. This is my third digital recorder by Olympus and they just keep getting better and better. The DS-20 model has plenty of room for recording multiple interviews before I'd need to download them. The quality and feature set are excellent. Wish I had one of these in graduate school!
5,GREAT BUY $$$$$$$,packaging was simple and secure you dont have to worry if somebody did something to your brush because they come sealed in the toothbrush box and on top of that in a blue plastic seal and in a amazon box youll receive it right on your door step... got exactly what i ordered will buy again in the future it saved me alot of money
5,Great Christmas Story,"I must have read this book every day before Christmas, once that day came and went it was still my childs favorite McDuff Story, two months later I was able to pack it away for next year's holiday reading. We just love the McDuff Books."
3,Quite good,"My overall impression of this DVD is that Amir is quite knowledgeable about the doumbek. I found it interesting that he presented the different types of doumbeks together with a brief history. Some of the editing is choppy, especially as he is explaining technique. I think he could have also spent more time going in depth into technique. But when he goes into showing rhythms the editing is constant and the variations are quite interesting."
5,Great learning tool,"I have been playing drums, congas and Djembe for about ten years now. Most of what I've learned has been self taught,(books, tapes, videos and DVDs) after some basic classes. I have also played with an African drum and dance group for 8 years. This DVD is an excellent product for the beginning Doumbek player(which I am). Starts with the basics:How to hold the drum, how to get the various sounds from the drum correctly. There are many practice rhythms that directly apply to the other classic rhythms that are demonstrated later on. The notation is clearly explained and it is easy to follow along with the DVD. Amir Naoum starts with the basics of the rhythms and elaborates on them as each lesson progress's. Amir's presentation is geared for the new doumbek drummer and he appears to have a gentle sense of humor."
5,Definitely recommended.,Fantastic material. Techniques are presented very didactically with rhythm notation on screen. Very useful for the beginner drummer.
5,Doumbek DVD,"I really enjoy this DVD. Amir is a good teacher. He shows great basic classical Arabic doumbek technique. Amir takes that further by demonstrating technique in the context of middle eastern rhythms. Then within each rhythm Amir shows several, increasingly more complex variations to challenge your newly learned techniques. This DVD is good for beginners as well as seasoned drummers wanting to polish up their classical Arabic technique on the doumbek."
4,Buen Dvd para aprender algunos ritmos basicos en profundidad!,"Ok, Este Dvd me ha parecido bastante bueno, Amir explica de manera sencilla los ritmos y la técnica, también he de decir que profundiza bastante en cada ritmo, mostrando las diferentes variaciones al detalle.Lo recomiendo para aquellos percusionistas que estén en un nivel de principiante a medio y necesiten material para desarrollar y aprender técnica y ritmo.Saludos a todos."
4,Good DVD,"A good basic introduction to doumbek techniques. He breaks down the rhythym into an understandable language. I bought it for my 9 year old nephew, but I found it to be very informative and useful.It is what it says it is. Worth buying"
5,Great beginner DVD,"I am a beginner. I bought this DVD and another DVD about doumbeks. I liked this DVD more, because the exercises and lessons are easier to follow at the beginning.It is systematic, gives basic information at the beginning, and it has nice lessons and exercises which can be followed easily. I fully recommend this DVD."
5,Interesting,"This book is an excellent guide to all of the elements. What their applications are, how they are used, when they were discovered, etc. Those interested in learning more about the elements are sure find a lot of the information in this book fascinating. My only real complaint is that it lacks some of the basic information such as boiling points or atomic weights. However, I feel the information already contained in the book makes up for this.The book is a little out of date today. There is no mention of the latest discovered artificial elements or how bismuth was recently discovered to be radioactive. But still, there is too much good information in this to pass it up."
4,"Very useful, clear book",I bought this book for my son who is studying chemistry. He has found it to be a very useful adjunct to his chemistry textbooks. It gives him a clear overview of each element.
1,"KINDLE VERSION is second edition, not third edition",Tthe Kindle version is the second edition and not the third. Otherwise the contents look very interesting and informative as other reviewers noted.
3,"Its worth it. not the best, more like a toy","Well it works, picture quaility is kinda bad, and the video is jjerky and bad pixliation. No light or flash, BUT it was 75 bucks, Great for having funs, and camping trips. I would buy it if your looking to have something to be rough with, but i would spend 50 bucks more for a C330 Kodak. Its awsome, compared to this one."
2,it is just ok...,"This little camera is handy...but not always reliable. We took a cruise to Alaska from Vancouver and I thought this would be a great little toy to take with me. Some of the pictures and video turned out great. Some was extremely grainy. Many of the pictures were completely out of focus, and while that does not surprise me on landscapes, portrait shots of people taken less than 12 feet away should not have focus issues. The video recorder itself works ok, but I would suggest spending just a little more and getting something with better quality."
3,yup good to have,"i just bought this item but i sitll haven't got it and when i went on to e-bay to buy the same item good think i didn't. there they gave me a low down on whats up. the product looks good and the cards well budies they just give u like a 16mp card wich isn't much but u can buy thoes cards online cheap. that holds i believe up to like 60 pics or less im kind of going over board but the camcorder sounds to bee really good and hey if u don't like it. Sell it on e-bay, other morones that don't check places will buy it for more then you paid for it if your lucky."
3,Disappointing illustrations,"While the story is atypical and refreshing in portraying a young female character who appreciates rather than fears insects, the artist's interpretation is trite and unimaginative. Amanda Frankenstein, decidedly plain and bespeckled, reinforces the stereotypical image of the ""nerdy"" scientist (entomologist)."
5,great capsule probiotic,"I first used this probiotic during a cleanse last year, and it worked wonders on my digestive system. I now only need it once in a while when I get off the wagon (usually yogurt suffices) and eat too much processed food but it is definitely the best capsule form probiotic I've used, and given my history with digestive issues, I've used a lot of the products out there."
1,This book is a horrible. It is simply plaigarism,"This book was horrible. It mentions John Cromwell's book, ""Hitler's Pope"" in the forward and calls it ""the latest contribution to the sorry genre,"" but does nothing to refute it. This author is just plain bad. He does NO ORIGINAL RESEARCH!!! This book has only TWO SOURCES, namely, Pierre Blet's ""Pius XII and the Second World War"" and Pinchas Lapide's ""The Last Three Popes and The Jews.""All this author does is repeatedly quote his two sources and fail to counter any of Cornwell's arguements.The bottom line: This book is the worst book that exists on this subject."
4,Worth the Read- one of the best,"IN response to the recent trash novels about the role of the pope in WWII, this excellent book is a welcome arrival.The author shows with great accuracy how the pope saved directly or indirectly the lives of some 860,000 Jews.But why has Pius XII been so defamed? What has motivated the untruths? It has been the result, the author argues, of the Church's stance on sexuality. In fact, it can be easily argued and defended that as soon as the Church changes its teaching on sex and abortion, the ""faith"" would be welcomed with open arms by the left."
2,Dismayingly Bad,"It is nothing short of astonishing that the man who wrote the excellent ""What Went Wrong with Vatican II"" has also written ""The Defamation of Pius XII"" -- one of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune to read. Amateurishly written -- e.g., ""Pius's intervention at this crucial juncture was crucial."" (page 129) -- edited, and presented, Ralph McInerny has rendered a disservice to Pope Pius. McInerny is correct: The former Holy Father was NOT Hitler's handmaiden -- quite the contrary. But saying so in a book that appears to have taken less than a week to complete doesn't exactly help the cause."
5,The best for clear (silver) inkjet printing,These have the best surface for silver (clear) inkjet printing. Highly recommended.
5,Much better than Palm,"This Windows CE device was what I needed after being tethered to a Palm Pro for over a year. I couldn't do much with the Palm, other than read mail and take notes. Now, it looks and feels like I'm taking my desktop with me. I bought a 32MB CF card with it, and I'm happy with it.The only thing to improve would be the sound. That little speaker doesn't put out enough volume, however, through earphones it sounds good."
4,Where is the MP3 player?,"I bought this thinking it would be my do-it-all device. Voice recorder, address book, calendar/to do list, and mp3 player. It does it all except the MP3 player part. A reviewer said he loved the MP3 player capability. -NOT- If you load MP3 files into it, there is no player to play them. At least Win CE can not find anything to use to play them. Is the player an add on? If so, where can I get it.Larry"
3,Love the music/CD - DVD: not so much,"Let me start by saying that I LOVE the music and fun lyrics! The CD is fabulous, different, and fun for both grownups and kids. However, I was disappointed in the DVD. The animation is sadly lacking - - it's more like each song is accompanied by a series of illustrations that occasionally move. While the illustrations are fun and lovely, they failed to capture my 2 y/o's (or my) attention. So, if you're buying for the music, it's a fantastic purchase, but if you're looking for a fun DVD for kids, I'd look elsewhere."
5,A great overview of Elliott Murphy's first four albums,"I bought Elliott's ""Night Lights"" in 1976 after reading a review in the LA Times. Loved it. Couldn't get the tape out of my car's 8-track tape player. Songs like ""Diamonds by the Yard"" and ""Isadora's Dancers"" were classics, although they didn't get any radio airplay.I went back and bought ""Aquashow"" and ""Lost Generation"", Elliott's previous two albums, and became a big fan.The next year ""Just a Story from America"" was released and it also became one of my favorites.I don't have any knowledge of these albums having been released on CD, but I wish the record company would consider putting this man's best work out there for fans to enjoy.A lot of the best songs from those albums are on this compilation, but I can recall a few others that didn't make it (""Lady Stiletto"", a song about Patti Smith, being one of them).""Diamonds"" is a definite must for anyone's collection."
2,Smells Cheap to Me,"I had good expectations based on other reviews. I truly do not like this scent. It smells very cheap to me. Granted, it was only $15 bucks. It is not very sweet. There is a strong overtone of citrus. I don't smell much floral. It actually irritates my nose/throat if I wear it. I took a chance buying without ever smelling because of the price and reviews. Hopefully I can find a friend who likes it and give it away."
1,scentless,"I have used this perfume, Liz, for 2 years and I am wondering what is different..EDP? Usually everyone says how wonderful I smell--all day long! With this bottle I can't even smell it after 2 miniutes!!!!!!!!!!!! I am bummed with this purchase but do not know what it is that has changed? Maybe I bought the ""cologne"" before? I just don't know."
5,This is Pittsburgh rock and roll,"Most people don't know it, but this album signaled the second coming of Donnie Iris, whose 1965 band The Jaggerz took ""The Rapper"" to #2 on Billboard's Hot 100. Along with bands like the Houserockers and the Clarks, Donnie and the Cruisers define Pittsburgh Rock and Roll. If you come into the Steel City and leave without seeing Donnie Iris live, you haven't experienced Pittsburgh."
5,My Best Friend,My best friends name is leah and when i heard it on the radio i instantly loved it because it is exactly the way I feel about her and it says it exactly and i still don't know what to do about it
3,Ah! Donnie Iris!,"This is the Donnie Iris album that has ""Ah Leah!"" on it. Problem is, it was pretty rocky after that. Iris and partner Marc Avsec played everything on this album, and it comes off a bit too stiff. Also, there is too much going on here to make Iris sound like he was doing much else other than chasing styles. Aside from ""Agnes"" and ""I Can't Hear You,"" there is little here that sounds like an artist defining himself. (Nonsense like ""Joking/Shock Treatment"" don't help his case, either.) Besides, after this, Iris put together the Cruisers and cut the far superior ""King Cool."" Since the three best songs on ""Back On The Streets"" are on the ""20th Century Masters"" set, you can steer yourself in that direction rather than pay for the over-priced used copies."
1,Bad Choice,We bought this based on its value -- you get what you pay for is true. The vcr in this our unit has broken 3 times in the 12 months we've owned it. next stop -- trash.
5,Outstanding study of an important US strategic partnership.,"Parker Hart was a career Foreign Service Officer who had a unique viewpoint on the history and strategic importance of Saudi Arabia as an ally of the United States. His knowledge of the people and customs of the Middle East, his command of Arabic, and his genuine interest in people of all countries made him the consumate diplomat. As US Ambassador to Saudi Arabia during the critical Yemen crisis, Hart was the on-the-ground negotiator who worked tirelessly to prevent the widening of a conflict with Egypt that could have resulted in a hot war between two important countries.Hart's life was a true-life adventure in the style of Indiana Jones; but this book is scholarly and will be most interesting to serious students of diplomacy and modern Middle East history."
4,"This is a very good book, BUT. . .","Crawford spins a good yarn, and the book is replete with lots of interesting and accurate Texas history. However, the guy ain't no Steinbeck! I wish he would have had someone edit his long and often convoluted sentences. As a tired old retired guy with thick glasses I think Crewford tends to keep typing much too long before he decides to call it a paragraph. When a paragraph goes on and on for a page-and-a-half my eyes get weary. However, it is worth the effort to read this book."
2,A disappointment,"I purchased this book based on a comment from Larry McMurtry in his book review of a historical account of the Commanche Indians. Based on this and the title, I had expected this to be a story about the Commanche and their way of life and struggles to survive in the face of the white man's enchroachment of their way of life. Instead the story is told from the point of view of a US Cavalry officer trying to quell the indians. Much different than I expected and thus a disappointment."
5,great idea,This works great with dogs. This is the first time I've seen it for horses. Amazon also offers individual tracks for download.
3,An ok book,"This book was recommend by so many people and there was so much positive feedback that I finally read it.I found the book very hard to read and it took me a year to finally get through it because I did not find it all that interesting. However, I'm not a SciFi fan, so you may take that with a grain of salt. The book was decent enough to keep me sufficiently curious to continue to the end to see what was going to happen. I also wondered if there was some surprise ending or message at the end that would pull it all together. I was disappointed to get to the end and not find that twist or 'ah ha' moment I was seeking.The book is simply a unique science fiction plot. It is written well enough and the story is original with some subtle, but real, connections to reality that will make you consider your own views on life--if you so desire--but there was no profound message or lesson."
4,Pretty good,"This book was pretty good. It had some mild surprises and interesting things to say about our future.The whole sibling relationship thing was a bit strange and unbelievable. And the ending was kind of perfunctory. But it kept my attention and moved along at a good pace. Not the greatest book ever, but a nice sci-fi novel."
5,Check the table of contents for the introduction,"Ender's Game is a classic, and I've recommended it to even those people who don't usually care for science fiction. I've loaned it so many times I've often needed a new copy for myself. The particular copy I bought, the one with the picture of the boy with his hand out, disappointed me: it's lacking the introduction by the author. It adds to the story, and is the kind of introduction you read after you've read the book. When you choose a copy, look for one (say, the mass-market paperback) that includes the introduction. You can check the table of contents using the ""search inside"" to be sure."
5,"Ender's Game, 5 Stars","I am not into sci-fi, however, this book is AMAZING. I couldn't put it down. In case you're wondering, it's about a boy named Ender who needs to try to save the human race. Meanwhile, the teachers, are pushing him further an further until he can't take it anymore. You need to read this book no matter what genre you like. You will laugh, cry, and smile. WARNING contain swear words and a few mature things. I'd say for ages 13+"
5,My best book so far.,Orson Scott Card is now my favorit author. I look forward to reading the rest of the series.
5,The reason I read,Seriously. This book is the reason I ever began to read for pleasure. After a random grab from my English class' book shelf I was hooked. I couldn't begin to describe the many levels this book is amazingly amazing and won't try. But I will say again that this book started it all for me.
5,Ender's Game Transcends Typical Science Fiction,"Reading Ender's Game in the sixth grade was an invaluable academic, as well as entertaining, experience. I'm all grown up now, and I long, sometimes, for those days of my youth. Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game has found its place in the pantheon of American Nostalgia."
5,Destined Classic,"I saw this book lying on my bookshelf, having bought it a couple of years ago and never getting around to read it. After picking it up randomly, i couldn't put it down except to go to work. It was so good i read it in almost a day. If your thinking about getting this book, don't think, just hit the one click."
3,A better than average sci-fi book,"Ender's Game was a fun read even with it's flaky story lines (training adolescents to save the world, kids vying for power by using the nets, etc.) The thing I don't understand is why so many people think it's the best sci-fi book ever written. Anybody every read Asimov? If you like sci-fi then you will enjoy this book, but I think you would be disappointed with Ender's Game if you don't like sci-fi."
3,Ender ends mediocre :-),"Pretty good book. I can't find anything else to say. Except of course mentioning the intricate plot in which we follow Ender on his way to supreme commander of the human spacefleet without ever knowing it himself. This is of course spiced up with the harsh interaction with the other students at the combat-school and you really start ""live into"" enders universe. Be there. Only drawback, I think, is the fuzzy ending. I've never read the other books in the series, but I sort of felt cheated when... Hehe, I won't tell you. Just read it."
2,Implausible and slow,"The plot of this book is silly -- a child is taken from his family at the age of five, trained to be the leader of the Earth's battle forces and then he saves the solar system at the age of 10. No matter how intelligent he is, no child at the age of six has had the life experiences to gain the type of judgement and wisdom that this boy supposedly has. Meanwhile, his two siblings are controlling the Earth by joining some chat rooms on the internet. Yeah, right. A second problem is that the story is unbelievable slow -- the ups and downs of his training take up about 80 percent of the book. Then the book wraps up in 10 pages and that's that. For a really good book about life in a futuristic army, read Starship Troopers. This book is a real disappointment."
5,Wow,"I loved this book. It starts off kind of confusing, but you will soon catch on. The book was a great pleasure to read. I was sad when i finished. But, now i can read the next one in the series. I cannot wait. Ender is a character to fall in love with, one to pity too. He has so much expected of him, and he is only six! But anyone who loves science fiction, and loves a good book will love this book!"
3,LotF,This is a really well written book which can really challenge a person's judgement and convey the truth about human nature to its reader. I recommend this book to any reader who likes a challenge.
4,Ender's Game Review,"Ender's Game is a very good book. I enjoyed reading it. The plot is far fetched, but that's alright because it's a sci-fi book. I thought Ender was a realistic character. He was a very interesting character. The book isn't very hard to read and about 300 pages long. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes sci-fi and some people who don't like it."
5,Ender&#65533;s Game,"Ender's Game is an awesome book. When I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. Orson Scott Card just drew me in. I was amazed how the kids are so intelligent. In the book, Peter, Ender's brother, has a major influence over world events when he is fourteen. It has all the essential parts of a great novel. Ender's Game has an amazing plot, and is very interesting. Card is very detailed about everything. I liked how he put so much detail in Ender's virtual game. Card explained it like if you were playing it. I started the book, and was required to read it in a couple weeks, and ended up reading it in three days. It is a very detailed science fiction book. The stuff in this book was science fiction, so it probably wouldn't happen now. But it could in the future. I think that in the future we could go live on a different planet like Ender does. I haven't read the other books in the series, but I hope that they are all as good as or better than this one."
1,"Excuse me, but no","Okay, what is it about this book does everyone love?? I don't understand. It's boring, there's no action, and the kid beats people up (not that I mind that). It has GOT to be one of the most boring books I've ever read, and the few actions scenes are not that well written."
2,Second only to Ayn Rand as crypto-Fascist trash.,"Wordy, banal, and politically wrong-headed; the kind of thing that appeals to unsceptical adolescents who find it ""deep"" because they believe it resonates with their own minuscule experience of life. Which is also true of Miss Rand's work.The characters were two-dimensional and unsympathetic, and the writing pedestrian. Also, the big surprise twist at the end was a surprise chiefly because it was utterly, ludicrously non-credible.Don't waste your time. Go read Patrick O'Brian instead. It will be much, much harder going -- and it will be much, much more rewarding."
5,Great Read,"I had heard good things about this book coming in, and it hasn't disappointed. I have been thoroughly entertained from the start!"
5,Incredible Book!,This book was incredible! The writing was great and the story had me hooked from the beginning. I could not put it down. This book went by fast and kept me interested the entire time!
4,An original space opera,"Ender's Game was a surprisingly refreshing take on the space opera genre. Orson Scott Card's characters were well thought out, each having their own distinct voice and personality. There have been too many novels in this genre with characters with flat personalities that have been virtual clones of already written stereotypes.***Contains Spoilers***Ender, the protagonist the in the novel's title, is a mentally gifted child in a future earth. When he interacts with other children and adults, it has a realistic ring to it. The story arc never falls flat, and the thought provoking ideas within are first rate. The book is difficult to put down with each chapter flowing into the next.**** End of Spoilers*****Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fiction, or even to those that don't. This novel is driven by the characters more so than future technologies. Great and enjoyable read!"
5,Excellent,I read this in one day. I loved how various twists were revealed at the right moments. Card has a way of hooking me into caring about Ender from just the first few pages and to the very end. I also liked how the language was kept mostly simple and the story was not bogged down in a bunch of techno babble.
2,Not as good as I had expected,After reading the reviews here on amazon I expected to read one of the best sci-fi books of all time. I was truly dissapointed. In short i'd say that it was very hard for me to identify with the main character. He's so young and alone and different from everyone else. If that doesn't describe YOU then you will probably not think this book is so great. Maybe it's because i'm now in my 20's. I have read many great books in my life and this wasn't one of them. If you are a young reader and feel like an outsider then you will probably LOVE this book.
3,Mediocre Plot with Little Speculative Fiction,"Die hard SCI-FI fans are going to be disappointed with this book because it's not about science fiction or fantasy. It's about relationships and a comming of age. This could easily have been set in medieval times, in an orphanage, in present day, or any other time period or place you can think of.The book is a good read, the same way that Harry Potter is a good read. Yes it is entertaining but does not scratch the surface to immerse you in the setting. For those of you who truly enjoy that sort of thing, I would recomend Dragon's Egg.OSC is one of my favorite authors because he does use relationships in his stories, I was just disapointed with this because his jaunt into sci-fi made it so obvious that he really should stay on the fantasy side with his Alvin Maker series."
2,"move along, nothing to see here . . .","the plot essentially involves super-genius children receiving military training in preparation for an invasion of alien insect creatures. much of the novel consists of detailed tactical descriptions of the equivalent of paint-ball played in zero gravity. the children then graduate to ""command school"" and rain on star-fighter simulators.The similarities between ender's game and the dreadful movie ""Starship Troopers"" only make matters worse.I read sci-fi either for (i) intelligent imaginings about future technology, or (ii) xeno-anthropology, for lack of a better term.Jack Vance and Iain Banks come to mind. This book lacks any of these qualities...However, the book has received good reviews from reputable sources, so maybe it just was not my cup of tea."
2,Sci-Fi With a Surprise,"This was another book club selection. It was a quick, easy read - but left no real impact. A pure pleasure read - if you're into science fiction, that is. I thought the end was overly contrived...too cute. It was almost as is Card was getting as tired of the battle room as I was. Then, as if to suddenly try to redeem the book as more than just a video game fantasy, he rapidly ages his characters and gives them conscience struggles.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this book. It's harmless, and there are worse books to read - but there are so many better ones out there, why waste the time? I'm just glad that I didn't shell out any money for my copy!"
1,The most overrated book I've ever read,"I got so many recommendations from friends about this book I thought I'd try it out. It was barely competently written, but somewhat forgivable since it was both an early work of Orson Scott Card's and also adapted from a short story. What wasn't forgivable was the incredible tediousness and complete absolute predictability of the story. There are no surprises at all - only stupid characters who fail to react to what is plainly obvious to every reader. This trend unfortunately continues in at least the second book Speaker for the Dead, which has even MORE STUPID characters who can't understand what is plainly obvious to the most intellectually challenged reader. This makes for a poor story and a poor reading experience, thus I cannot recommend this to ANYONE."
2,Pablum for the slow-witted masses.,"Science fiction for those who aren't capable of handling real science fiction. No mind-stretching concepts, no uncomfortable questioning of assumptions, no imagination required. A simple, easy-to-follow plot, written in small, easy-to-understand words. The ending is predictable from early on. Plenty of reassurance for the hard-of-thinking. As a short story, it was a bland attempt at an implausible premise stretched beyond the breaking point. Inflated into a pompous novel, it's a crime"
5,A very good read for open minded people,"I read this book years ago, and still re read it from time to time. I loved it then, and still do. It takes an open mind to think of the characters as more than just people, but also as the essence of people. I have read thousands of books, fiction and non-fiction, and have found alot worth reading in this one. Some of the sequels are better than others, but Speaker for the Dead also reflects Card's ability to understand how people, not just individuals, but people work. Many of my friends have borrowed this book and every time I re-read it, I find more little notes in it with comments about the book or the characters in the pages."
5,This was a pretty good book!,"I enjoyed this book! It's not my favorite, but pretty darn close! Now don't get me wrong. I know what some of you readers are probably thinking. This seems like the book only some Star Trek- fanatic would like, but it is a good book! Those sci- fi people probably do fall head-over-heels-in-love-with,but this is a book for a sci- fi lover or hater. It is a book about the elements of battle and a young boy who nobody understands. I liked it!"
5,Its greattttt!,"I first read the book in 1987. It was lent to me by a friend with his recommendations. It was so good that I remembered it till this day. While browsing at Amazon.com, I ran a search for it and end up buying it. I got it 3 months after ordering it! Well it was well worth the wait. I do notice that it was changed a bit especially at the end (mine was the author's definitive edition), but it made the book very much better. I didn't like the ending in the earlier edition. But Card still missed the mistake at page 177, it was ""Rose the Nose's mistake"" not ""Bonzo's mistake"" (please refer to page 105). I had just bought the entire Ender's series just now at Amazon.com. I hope I didn't make a mistake ;-) by doing that!!!"
3,Just a little overrated,"After reading several of the reviews posted here, I had high hopes for Ender's Game. Unfortunately, the story of a child genius who trains in battle games throughout an entire book (that's really all he does), which ends with an anti-climatic plot twist, is far from the classic sci-fi all these other readers seem to think it is. If you want really good sci-fi, try 'The Stars My Destination' by Alfred Bester, any of the 'Hyperion' saga books by Dan Simmons, or 'The Forever War' by Joe Haldeman. Those are true classics."
5,One of the top five science fiction novels of all time.,"It is an interesting occurance that nearly everyone who reads this book finds something different in it. Some find it a scathing indictment of the industrial-military complex, others see it as a tribute to the bravery of the soldier. Some find a Christian parable, others see Ender as a humanistic massiah.One thing is certain, however, this is the seminal novel for current and former GATE students. You know those kids who in Middle School were sent to special classes to take advanced classes but ended up just being pushed to do extra busy work. This book seems specailly poignant to them.Anyway, this is an excellent sci-fi novel. Don't be deceived by the seemingly simple story of alien invasion, there are many levels of depth."
3,Read it for the story,"Card is certainly gifted in his imagination. Unfortunately, you have to make your way through some very heavy-handed prose and cookie-cutter characters before you can start enjoying the story. Once you get beyond that, however, the story is truly captivating, and you can even suspend your disbelief that even super-genius children would behave in such a way. Beware, if you're a sci-fi fan, it will get you hooked, especially since the following books, Card begins to show a little more finess in his writing style."
5,Destined to be a classic,"Their are many reviews here, so there is no point in my rehashing, repeating, and saying the same stuff again. I will just say that of the hundred or so scifi books that I have read in the past 18 months, this was probably my favorite - but certainly in the top 3. Ranks right up there with some of my all-time favorites and as said in the title, ""Destined to become a Classic""."
4,Visually Engaging,"Scott is very good at creating a world that Ender can survive in. Very interesting and entertaining take on the military, society, and war."
3,I honestly do not understand why everyone thinks this is so special..,"I did not enjoy this book. I'm not just writing this to cause trouble--I hate it when people do that. This book took me FOREVER to read, and I'm usually a really fast reader.Ender's Game was reccommended to me by a friend who said it was her favorite book of all time. I was excited because my friend and I usually love the same books; however, this one was different!Sure, the plot was interesting, but it just repeated itself, over and over and over again. I thought the book was extremely slow and not too exciting. I am not one who gives up on books, and I had faith in this one, but I think that the only reason I ended up finishing the book was because I kept waiting for it to get better--which it did not.I've read worse books though, that's why I'm giving it 3 stars..."
5,Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!!,"One of the best science fiction books i've read. Great story line, great characters and great plot. I did not expect the ending, was a great ending. I started the next book in the series but it is not as good and takes place 3k years after ender's time."
4,Ender's Game,"Ender's Game is a wonderful book. It is a really easy read and so exciting that you won't want to put it down. Ender's character is taken from his home at age six and is constantly being manipulated by his commanders at battle school so he'll save the world from the buggers. They try to make him feel okay about hurting others so he can help them. He is able to win all of his ""simulated battles"" because he uses strategy and can understand his enemy. The more he learns about the enemy he questions whether or not they are that bad. I would highly recommend this book to everyone. The ending will shock you!"
5,Touching study of relationships,"I've lost track of how many times I've bought and given away copies of Ender's Game. It remains my favorite not because of the grand scale of the military sci-fi elements, but because of the grand scale of the emotions of the characters.Skimming through the reviews, I see that no one else has commented much on the relationship between Ender and his sister Val. Their love and devotion for each other across space and time can bring tears to my eyes, and has instilled in me a longing for such a sister which I have never been able to shake.This is the power of Card's writing - the ability to describe the experiences and emotions of his characters so clearly and powerfully that we can feel them as our own, and incorporate them as meaningful elements in our own lives."
3,Intense is the word.,"This was too intense for me, but I sort of liked Songmaster which was also expanded from one of his stories. (I think it was from analog or amazing.) Both books involved tormented kids so I wonder what that's about? I liked val though."
2,Mediocrity in a book...,"This book just left me wanting a little bit more. The conflicts seemed contrived, the deceptions were weak and thinly veiled, and the twist was not really a twist at all but was pretty obviously there all along.It might be possibly because I'm used to relatively intricate plots and developed characterizations and the author admittedly states the story is kept simple. Perhaps it's because I read this book over 20 years after it was released. It does have its good points, and I am a fan of Card's other works, but this one just kind of felt... juvenile.The best part of the book was after the climatic ""twist"", when Ender goes out and about. That part seemed to be the most intriguing part of the book, since there actually seemed like there would be drama and conflict instead of just Ender conquering obstacle after obstacle.Perhaps, it's the Superman syndrome. It is difficult to make a story interesting when the protagonist is basically, admitterdly, undefeatable."
3,Entertaining but not riveting.,I was recommended this as the best book someone had ever read. It didn't live up to that expectation but was an entertaining read.
3,"For me this inspired strong ,but mixed, feelings.","On the one hand this book is a real pageturner. I really got involved with the story & cared about the characters. There were pages I read over & over & over again. On the other hand the book is a real pageturner. I really got trapped in these people's torturous lives. There were pages that made me want to throw this book over & over & over a cliff. I have recommended it, but I'd never recommend it to a younger reader."
4,Not a classic,"Like others, I sought out 'Ender's Game' due to the fact that it won the Hugo and Nebula Awards. Apparently like some others, I too was a bit disappointed that the book didn't fully live up to all my expectations. Certainly it was an interesting page turner, but problems remain.I found the lack of description a bit hampering, almost as if the book is written for a 5th grade level, ie. he did this, she did that, etc...I did sympathize with Ender however, and his saga was consistently entertaining if not enthralling. For better and more in depth sci-fi, I'd suggest seeking out Stephenson, Dan Simmons, and William Gibson to name a few. Of course I just picked up 'Speaker', so obviously there is something going here..."
5,A true masterpiece,"""Ender's Game"" blew me away. Mainly it was the characters that astounded me. Their very human feelings, their deep layers of emotion and many doubts, made them real people instead of a group of imagined characters sprung out of the head of the author. Once I started ""Ender's Game"" I could not put it down. I savored every word, loved every minute spent with my nose in it. This book is a true masterpiece."
5,great read,do you like books? do you like characters with superhero-like abilities? do you like lasers that go pew-pew? Then you'll enjoy this novel.
3,It was Okay,I thought Enders game was ok. It was wierd how young children were being trained to be soildier and how a teen leeds an attack on aliens called buggers. In parts I wanted to know more about the I.F and there shaddy system. Overal it was okay
2,Very very slow,I chose this book strictly based on all the rave reviews. The first chapter or two kept my interest pretty strong. After chapter after chapter of Enders time in battle school I began to get a headache just from the serious lack of story. It was really like reading a self pitied diary about some kid in military school. I figured if I could just make it through the first half of the book the story would start to pick up. Unfortunately I wasn't so lucky. It just got slower! It was literally like you were reading different versions of the same chapter throughout the whole book! If this book ever makes it onto the movie screen I'm pretty sure there is going to be a lot of creative fluff added just to keep it visually entertaining. It was just so slow. Very little of the storyline actually held this book together. I did manage to suffer through the whole thing but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
5,Floored,This book is one of the most amazing things I have ever read in my entire life. I don't know much else to say. It is superb in every way.
5,Fantastic!,"Orson Scott Card tells the disturbing story of earths salvation, a young boy named ender. Ender must learn all that is necessary to become the greatest general of all time in order to save earth from a war with an alien race. Orson Scott Card masterfully crafts a politically unstable world of the not to distant future held together by fear of another alien attack. Orson Scott Card also puts you in the mind of a genius child put under extenuating stress and how he must cope. The situation of ender Wiggins will have you questioning morals, philosophy, and how much a child's mind can endure even if he is a genius."
5,So good!,"Loved this book! I love sci-fie and someone recommended this book to me, well worth the read. It was satisfying to read just by itself, but I will e looking forward to reading the rest of the series."
5,"Riveting, and brilliant sci-fi novel.","Ender's Game contains all the elements that contribute to an outstanding book. All of the characters are well developed, the suspense is well integrated and the plot is uniquely brilliant. The imagery in this book is also really impressive, especially in the 'Fantasy Game' but also in the other settings. As far as Science Fiction is concerned, the book is sorta outdated, however it is still a marvelous novel and I find it a pretty spectacular book considering when it was written.My only fault with the book was the age of all the characters. Though Ender, and the other characters have traits and attributions that resemble much older more mature individuals , the way they act and the things they achieve still add a daunting unrealistic front that is a little hard to swallow.Aside from that the book was fantastic and I would reccomend it to anybody. I read it in 2 days and enjoyed every moment of it because the author really is fantastic with accelerated plot."
2,Ender's Game,"Only read the beginning, could not get into it, too much about video games so it did not capture my interest. I think you need to be a gamer and sci-fi fan for this book."
3,Ender's Game until it Ends your in the Game,I thought Ender's Game was an interesting book. Like how in the battle rooms the children could practice shooting and if the shot than the person's space suit would freeze. I didn't like how Ender was always acting like he is just like his brother. He doesn't know himself until about half way through the book. I also thought the ending was bad. What was the deal with two boys kissing him I mean is that really nesscary. Overall I thought Ender's Game was a book that kept you interested but in some parts you think why couldn't I have read another book I give this book a 3 though I think the author Orson Scott Card could have done a better job.
2,Military School,I nice story for teenagers. I do not recommened this story for mature adults. The story is about a helpless teenager being victimized by bullies and adults.
5,Sci-fi for people who don't like sci-fi,"It's a shame so many people, who think they don't like sci-fi, will never read this book, (and that means you TD! lol) as it is one of the most enjoyable, most 'human' books I've ever read. Without fail, anyone I've been able to cajole into reading it has enjoyed it - it's a classic."
5,Really good and digestible sci-fi,"I've only recently started reading sci-fi books and Ender's Game was a great book for someone first entering the genre. The storyline, character development, and immersion of the reader are both very deep while still remaining straight forward. Card does a great job telling this story."
5,Great Book!!,"The book was used but looked new and came in within a few days. I haven't read this book in over 5 years, but after I got it a few days ago remaindered why I loved it. I read it in 1 night!!"
1,childish,Having an eleven year old defeat an aliencivilization is a little implausible evenfor science fiction. On top of that thewriting seldom rises beyond the level ofa young adult novel. All in all a prettygrim and unrewarding read.
1,One Simple Twist Does Not A Novel Make,"This book could have been written as a short story ... by a thirteen year old.It could be retiled ""Recess goes to Space"".How anyone could rate this little-boy-saves-the-day story alongside the greats of SF is utterly beyond me.This book was lent to me by someone who simply couldn't wait to see what I thought of the twist in the tale. I won't repeat the conversation we had after I finished.Thank God I didn't spend money on this simplistic, trivial, waste of paper."
1,I did manage to finish it,"It was a grind. One game after another. I kept thinking that anytime something new would happen. You can't save a boring book with 2 chapters. This is not a great SF; in fact, it is a very low end one. Additionally, good SF must be believeable; this was not."
1,I liked it,I felt the book was good. Yet I don't understand the star system here...Oh well. Hope I didn't throw off the average. I liked battle school.
1,Awesome book,"this is the best book i have ever read. not only is it very entertaining, it is a very deep. I recommend this book for everyone."
1,twisted world by a twisted mind,"Throughout the book it is dominated by hatred and violence, it is a mindless world only abusing and killing prevail, all these happen among small children is even more disturbing. It is not suitable for kids, neither for adults.Card is a human hater, in his world, children are manipulated to hate each other by adults, to train them to be killing machines, to do that they need first kill each other, the only compassion in this book is from the buggers and for buggers, not for human.The writting style is awful, the story line is as good as an arcade game's(that's why it attracts kids, for worse), the character just keeps going to other levels to fight other monsters, yet they are all the same, only bigger. This repeats over and over, and all the dialogues are like the sound of scraping metal sheets. In the end, if you have children, try your best to protect them from this book, it is poison."
1,I would give it 0 if I could...,"This book is amazingly bad. It has every single trait of a bad book, it is:A: RepetitiveB: BoringC: LongD: DepressingThe book is about a genius 6 year old cadet in military school where everyone is violent and evil and wants to injure or kill everyone else. His brother (who is only slightly older than he is) is homicidal. This is a very popular book, but I sincerely and absolutely hated it.(In fairness to the book, however I did not finish it. I only read half because I was so bored with it I stopped.)"
1,Ender's Game is Lame!,"I had to read this book for class. I was very disappointed in the quality of this literature. It was so melodramatic! And they made Ender appear to be a semi-God. To keep it short, it was terribly boring. TERRIBLY. My suggestion to you is, RUN, RUN, Run away from Ender's Game, before you get boredom cancer like me!Kit-Kat, Tank, Manny, Nyk"
4,Why did I wait so long to read this!!!,"It started out slower than I would have liked, but in thinking back its probably ok, because now this epic adventure is over and I can't get it back! A fantastic read that I kept putting off when looking for a new story to read ... now that I finally have though - WOW! The reviews are all great from me, fantastic read!"
5,Much more than science fiction.,"Ender's Game is much more than a science fiction novel. Pay no attention to the naysayers who can't understand more than the technical aspects of fiction. On a whim, I read the first chapter at the bookstore, and ended up sitting there until closing time 5 hours later, still reading. This must be one of the most intense and influential books I've ever read in my life. As indicated by the previous reviews, many people can identify with characters in the story; critics of Card's character development only show that they missed out on childhoods that make such a story profoundly moving to almost all its readers."
4,All in all a great book but the last 10 pages are garbage,"I thought the intricate storyline and the many unexpected plot twists were very impressive, but that most caertainly by no means excused the pathetic ending that Card created for this certain title. (For all who have read this title: He should have just stomped on the stupid cocoon or whatever it was)."
4,Ender is the boy I have always dreamed of being.,"I am a 23 year old male in the United Sates Marine Corps. Not that it makes a difference to the people outside the military but Ender's Game is on the Commandant's Reading List for Marines that are Corporal and Sergeant. I myself am a Lance Corporal. I was first introduced to this book from my OIC and she spoke highly of the book. I decided to read the book and found myself staying up until 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning. I also found that I was emotional to the way Ender was treated and I wished I was there to help him. I have had my dreams and nightmares being in the military. One of my most interesting dreams is one in which I am extremely intelligent and nothing can throw me or stand in my way from achieving greatness. I aspire now to be like Ender. Orson Scott Card is now on my ""Authors to keep an eye on"" list. This book comes highly recommended from myself to you."
4,"A great sci fi novel, but lacking in some areas","I found ""Ender's Game"" to be a great read and a fantastic story, but I wish the author would provide more descriptive details. He does explain in the preface that this was his intention, allowing readers to experience the story using their own imagination. I can appreciate that, but there were some of the games in Battle School I had a hard time visualizing because the author gave very little details.The second reason for my four star rating is that I personally did not feel the age of the children was realistic. Again, he touches on this in the preface, giving examples of children who have written to him stating how much they identified with Ender. My problem is that Ender is 6 years old, being groomed and trained to be a military commander. If he was 12-13 I could find it more plausible. That nagging feeling of it being unrealistic stuck with me throughout the book.Besides these two points, Ender's Game is definitely a book worth reading."
5,Ender's Game,"An alien race has just attacked earth twice, and nearly destroyed the earth. Now to prevent the 'Buggers"" from destroying us the government has taken the smartest children into space to train them to be commanders of the International Fleet (IF). A child named Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggen is the brightest kid in the battle school and also the youngest soldier in his army. When Ender makes it to command school he is to be trained to be a commander by completing all of the games he plays. But Ender is smart enough to know something is wrong. Read this book to find out what is wrong and what happens to Ender.This is a fast paced, exhilarating novel. It was an enjoyable, thrilling, edge of your seat read. I like Orson Scott Card's books a lot and I hope to read the rest of the series. Some other books in the series are: Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, Children of the Mind, Ender's Shadow and Shadow of the Hegemon."
2,Ender's game is 2 dimensional,"I understand this book is very popluar with the new crowd, but I think that compared to some of the books in the 50's such as Clarke's City and the Stars or Bester's Stars My Destination, this book is very 2 dimensional and hermetic, as would be a stage play. While the idea is interesting, the whole plot turns on a trick like pulling a rabbit out of a hat, eg: the ""game"" is a real ""war"". Whoopee, neat trick, penned for the Nintendo generation. I'll stay with Silverberg, Doc Smith, Asimov or George Stewart's Earth Abides. Ender's game is for the Reagan era offspring - light pap. Ender obviously is incapable of jaunting. Now if you excuse me, I'll jaunte to the Lesser Magellenic Cloud."
3,Oh no...,"Those who gave this book 5 stars are going to hate me, but here I go.First of all, this USED to be my favorite book, but now as I look back on it, I was young and happy to be reading an adult novel. I can now review it truthfully.Part of this novel is dumb, like how Ender's Dragon Army wins ALL their battles, and they are only Launchies! (Young and untrained)It made no sense to me HOW Ender did what he did (at the end). No sense at all.If you wanna read an OK book and do it quickly, read this. You might even be compelled to read the sequels, who knows?For you Ender lovers, remember I was one too. Now though, I see the REAL Ender's Game, and it isn't as good as you all say.Sorry to anyone who loves this book. I'm just doing my job as a dutiful reader to tell what I think.Adios"
2,"Well crafted, but will disappoint the mature reader.","Following a veritable blizzard of recommendations for this book, I finally decided to read Ender's Game. What I found was an exciting well-written novel, with just one key problem: Card doesn't respect his reader, and thus the novel is predictaable. I know something of Science-Fiction, having read it for many years. I wasn't expecting another Dune or Foundation, but to rank this novel among them is a horrible mistake. There was never a time in this book when I was not at least a page ahead of the author, usually further. The surprise ending should not have been a surprise to anyone who has dabbled in short science-fiction. One ought to read Ender's Game, and enjoy it, and perhaps even cerish it, but to rank it among the best Science-Fiction written is folly."
4,Great book with lots of depth.,"This book is written well, and has an amazing story. It really delves into the true nature of humanity, and the evil that can exist in all of us."
3,Just OKAY,"Entertaining enough to read, a quick read. This book is similar to but not quite as good as The Hunger Games. Recommend more for the younger crowd."
3,I beg to differ,"I was somehow fooled by the raving reviews of most readers. This novel is the first I read by this author; the storyline is interesting enough although I found the narration of Ender's training way too long. To me, the main weakness of this novel is the somewhat flimsy psychology of the main characters. I particularly liked the notion that one blogger can influence World politics and decision makers alothough it's a bit far fetched, of course. A good book, but honestly speaking I have read quite a few SF novels better than this one."
5,Modern masterpiece,"With Ender's Game, Orson Scott Card manages to create a masterpiece. Card creates a wonderful character in Ender Wiggin. He uses wonderful characterization and includes a healthy dose of psychology, giving great depth to an already fascinating story. The situations he places Ender in create empathy in anyone who ha ever faced the great challenge of peer judgement or sibling rivalry.Ender Wiggin and his family rise up to great challenges and overcome them, despite their age. This sends a great message, because often in our society gifted children and teenagers are overlooked and passed off as inferior.Ender's Game is filled with intensity. The battles and fight scenes thorughout the book are so well written that I found myself unable to put the book down while I was reading them. Maybe after people read this they will realize how capable some children are. A modern masterpiece, Ender's game is a must read for all."
4,"Exciting, touching, and great to read!","I'm 14 years old and I'm currently reading this book for my English Class. When I had first saw the book, my response was.. ""eww yuck."" Because I HATE to read sci-fi books!! But this one is different, this one (unlike other sci-fi books with high reading levels) is great! It's exciting and it makes me wonder about the future. I'm still reading it (like half way), and I love it! I guess I'll post another review when I'm done with it.. It's worth it! Anyone would like it, whether you like sci-fi or NOT!!"
3,Ordinary Genius Saves the Universe,"It's hard for an author to write about a character who is smarter than they are. Sometimes it works out, like in Stanislaw Lem's fiction. Here it didn't. Good action, cute end. Harmless writing sytle"
2,"OK for a quick, easy read","Like many people I suspect, I read this book because of the hype. It was entertaining and an easy read, but didn't leave much of an impact. I didn't mind Card's writing style, rather dull, but to the point. My complaint is how he handled the minor characters, especially Peter. Why even introduce a character if you are not going to develop it in anyway? The psychology of Peter, and for that matter Val, is barely touched upon and then Peter seems to disappear from the story all together, as though the author grew bored with him. It could have been a better story with more character development, as it is, it is still a fairly entertaining and quick-paced story."
5,Ender's Game,"This book takes place in the distant future. Aliens are trying to wipe out the human race. Earth has made a defense by breeding military geniuses to fight them. Ender is the main character in this story. Because he is so incredibly smart, he is chosen to go to Battle School to learn how to fight the aliens effectively. Valentine is Ender's sister and she is always by his side trying to help him in any way she can. The action is non-stop as the fate of humanity rests in Ender's capable hands. You will NOT be able to put this book down. That is why I gave this book 5 stars. It is action-packed and full of suspense. You will love Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. I surely did."
5,A child rearing guide,"Mr. Card autographed my copy of Ender's Game with these words: ""A Child Rearing Guide.""The attraction that his book holds for many readers is that the science fiction serves as a masquerade, while the real story dives into the very essence of what makes us human.We read it once for the action, but we read it a second and third time because we identify with Ender, because his story rings true in our hearts."
5,Excellent!,"Ender's Game is a fascinating jump into the future where battles are waged in outer space against a deadly alien force. Soldiers and commanders are trained from childhood, maximizing their learning abilities and taking advantage of their impressionable minds. Ender is a childhood prodigy, bullied at school and tortured by his brother at home. With vivid imagery we follow Ender through his difficult training and watch how he struggles to overcome each new situation he faces, with brilliant improvisation and counter-manipulation. The climax and conclusion are equally unexpected and satisfying."
5,Amazing and thought-provoking,"This is an amazing book. I couldn't put it down. The characters are complex and well-defined, and the way the world treats these genius children will really make you think. Ender is superhuman, but lovable and sympathetic. A must-read."
4,Yet another review....,"Yes, I'm going to throw my two cents in too, and, in case you couldn't tell from all the 5 stars, yes, it is a good book. It's well written, has good character development, is well thought out, well paced, and entertaining. This book would have good 5 stars except (and here it comes) I had some issues with it. First off, unbelievable. I can take Ender being the military boy wonder, or Valentine the great writer, or Peter the great political mind, but to have all 3 in the same family and forever change humanity is a bit far reaching. I think the military, having discarded Peter, would have killed him rather than let such evil genius run around loose. Another problem was the ending of the war, is there anyone who didn't see that coming? (I'm trying not to give away the plot here). And lastly, while the writing was good, it felt...hollow? It was a very simple read. Don't get me wrong here, I recommend this for reading, it IS a good book, but it isn't without it's faults."
4,You ain't seen nothing yet,"I kind of hesitate to give this one only four stars, but I will because I want to be fair to the whole series. The books that follow are amazing. I found them tremendously entertaining in a way that stimulates the mind. Card uses his stories to introduce interesting perspectives of human nature. The characters are so real that we actually care about them and understand them and feel for them. I give the series as a whole five out of five stars, and for that reason I very highly recomend Ender's Game. I give Ender's Game only four because it is almost just an introduction. It definitely stands on it's own very well, but after reading what comes after, it is very limited in comparison."
5,The best,"Well, I'm really writing this review for the whole series that starts with Enders Game, then goes on to Xenocide, then Speaker for the Dead and Finally Children of the Mind (actually there's one more called Enders shadow which is a parallel novel to Enders game). If you like physics, astronomy, great stories and characters you will never forget this is the book for you. Even friends of mine who hate sci-fi loved this series. A must read, trust me!"
5,This is a book for the ages,This is an awesome book. Everyone that I have talked to that has read it has really connected with the character Ender.
4,Ender's Game Review (reading 100),"I usually don't find science fiction books interesting. I thought they were useless and non-essential. After reading this book for one of my classes, I actually enjoyed Ender's Game. I couldn't put the book down. It's action packed, funny, inventive, and a very good book. Orson Scott Card is very intelligent and he shows it in Ender's Game. He's a very inventive author. He has a very wide imagination. The book is so creatively detailed that you feel like you're actually there, fighting the buggers with Ender. You feel like you're one of the students at the Battle School. Its an amazing book! I'd recommend this book to anyone who is up for any kind of action and comedy."
4,Science Fiction at its best,"Card tells an introspective yet fast-paced tale of manipulation- both genetic and mental. Ender is a character that's always being pushed to his breaking point and always finding a way to overcome. He is both frightened and exhilirated by the lengths he's willing to go to. This is an excellent story of the sort of internal struggle that many people can identify with.I particulary enjoyed Card's depictions of the military simulations Ender and his fellow gifted peers engage in. Some of the tale was a bit hard on my suspension of disbelief in that it was hard to envision the characters thinking and acting the way they do at such young ages. But that flaw, if you can even call it that, was easily remedied by the sheer depth of Card's character development. This book kept me reading, and the double surprise ending didn't disappoint. In fact, it made getting the rest of the Ender series an easy decision."
5,EXCELLENT READ,"At first, I thought this was going to be another version of The Maze Runner series or even Hunger Games. Post apocalyptic ""event"" world with children bearing the brunt of the fall-out. I should state for the record I loved both those series.I was delighted to find in this book Card takes that same concept but refines it for an older audience and literally and figuratively takes it in a different direction. EXCELLENT book and could not put it down!"
2,Repetitive,The first 2/3 of the book is essentially the same thing over and over again. Basically until you are just about sick of it. The only thing that kept me going was the hope that something was going to change and I had gone so far already.The concept and story is a great idea but unfortunately doesn't develop through the book.
3,Fun and Silly Book,"Maybe if I had read it when I was a kid, it would have hit home a little more. Great idea for a book, fun things (""Buggers"") but after awhile I felt a little silly reading the ENDLESS descriptions of mock battles of six-year-olds.Technical challenge: How could instantaneous communication across vast distances of space, even if it were possible, be achieved with a spaceship that is traveling at near-light speeds and thus would have a different scale of time? That's okay, relativity doesn't have to apply to kids books!Nice work, Orson Scott Card."
3,Uneven read,"It was a real page-turner. The charm of the book lays mostly in character development (Ender's and Valentina's - others are mostly cardboard) and vivid and somewhat gruesome descriptions on the here-and-now events. The book is flawed though by the mostly linear storyline and sickeningly melodramatic ending with an Alaska-sized logical hole. Nevertheless, quite recommended for the fans of hero-based sci-fi."
2,what is all the fuss about?,"After so many friends raved about this book, I was very disappointed when I finally read it. THe premise is silly, the characters so comic-bookish as to be unbelievble, and the science is questionable. Maybe I am geting fed up with science fiction, but I still believe that one of the so-called classics should be much much better. Oh well."
2,"Shallow, silly book. Would not recommend to anyone older than 12.","The book has an interesting premise and a good plot twist, but the characters are so shallow and unbelievable that I would only recommend this book to kids, or only to anyone who has never read actual good literature."
2,Juvenile and predictable,"As other reviewers have said, if you are 12 years old you might like it. I love scifi and anything space related, and I have published 3 novels (so I am loathe to rip on any writer's effort) but this book is really not good. It is the Winnie the Pooh of scifi. The training the ""soldiers"" undergo is so simplistic it's borderline idiotic (I mention this because it's the central theme of the book), the dialogs and reactions of the main characters are forced and stiff, the ending so completely predictable ... Do yourself a favor and go for adult reading, Richard Morgan or China Mielville or, hell, anyone else."
2,Why on earth is this book so praised?,"Winner of the Hugo and Nebula awards? Really? This is a book with only marginally decent prose, unlikeable characters and a weak plot and it has been deemed equal to masterpieces written by authors such as Asimov, Dick, Gibson and Le Guin?Sorry to all the fans, because I know there are many who love this series, but this book is not worth the hype. There is nothing worse in terms of characterization than surrounding your protagonist with villains who have no reason to be mean in order to make us sympathize with the victim. It is also mind-boggling to see something as ridiculous as eugenics employed in sci-fi, of all genres, to justify the presence of not one, but three genius children in one family. World domination via message boards? Seriously? The worst part of it all is that Ender is meant to be a long-suffering, courageous hero, according to Card. That is not the book I read.My advice: read this as the 'making of' of a serial killer and you might enjoy it."
4,Very Good. One of the best Sci-Fi,"I really liked Ender's Game. There were some parts which just made you so mad..which was a good thing..lol. The author truly made you feel what Ender was feeling in the book. It was incredible. However, even though ""Ender's Shadow"" is *not* in the Ender's Series...I think that had the best view of everything. I read both ""Ender's Game"" as well as ""Ender's Shadow"" at the same time and it was well matched. However, I think Bean's POV in Ender's Shadow had a more simpler way of explaining the complicated parts. Not that I'm saying Bean's simple. Lol. He's anything but. I really like Bean and Ender. They are both really, really well explained and they're very real. Orson Scott Card is one of my favorite Sci-Fi writers and I recc. anything he has written or will write."
3,"Decent, but fails near the end","I chose to read this book due to the thousands of 5 star reviews. I like the majority of the book, but when it got toward the end of the middle and end of the book, the pace seemed to quicken too much. I like fast paced books, but near the end, everything was closed out in a matter of one chapter mostly. I like quick reads, but it seemed like the author ran out of ideas and just came up with a bunch of stuff to end all of the stories taking place.I did not like the political aspects of this book, with Valentine and Peter. I thought that the characters they made up on the Net were useless and just added in to make the book longer. The author should have come up with something better to fill the gaps......that's what I felt the story line was.....a gap filler.Overall, I give this book 3 stars because it was good at first, but then just got plain odd and because of the political story in the book, which was, for a lack of a better word.....lame!!!"
5,Possibly the best book I've ever read.,"I loved this book. I looked ahead though, and decided I didn't like the direction the story takes in the subsequent books, so I decided I would not read them. This author is an amazing story teller."
3,Don't believe the hype,"My friends are all totally obsessed with this book, and after reading it I must say I was sorely disappointed. Sure, parts of it were engrossing, and the surprise ending was somewhat interesting, but as a whole it just isn't that appealling. With the exception of Valentine and one or two of Ender's friends, none of the characters are in any way likeable (including Ender). Don't lose heart though, the 3 sequels are FAR superior! (Xenocide is UNBELIEVABLY good). I suggest reading it simply so the sequels will make more sense"
5,86% of reviews have a 5 star rating,"How about some statistics ? Of the 776 reviews on this site as of this writing, 669 of them (86%) are 5 stars. The string ""best book"" can be found 185 times. ""ever read"" : 186 times. ""favorite"" : 58 times. ""masterpiece"" : 23 times. ""compelling"" : 22 times. ""buy this book"" : 13 times. What else is there to say ?"
5,This is the best sci-fi book I've ever read.,"This book is one of my all-time favorites. I first read it in eighth grade on a recommendation by my english teacher. I figured, ""Oh yeah, this will be good."" I was wrong. ""Ender's Game"" grabbed my attention from the beginning and hurdled me through to the very end. I loved it. Orson Scott Card's description and detail of his world of the future was always riveting and left me spellbound when I finally finished the book. Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin is a very likable character that keeps the story flowing. And he is one tough kid. This book has a great fight sequence that puts Alfred Hitchcock's shower scene to shame. Zero gravity battles in an enclosed dome, space rides at close to light speed, and instant message transmission across the galaxy are just some of the things we experience while we're reading this masterpiece of science fiction literature. The screenplay and film are under negotiation to be made now. I, for one, can't wait."
5,What a book!,"I really loved the book ""ENDER'S GAME"". I was writing something myself and someone suggested to read the book. Unlike many books I read, I read this one in less than a week. Card's ability to create realistic and dramatic characters has never dissapointed me."
4,"GREAT IDEA, BUT ENDING RUSHED","I loved this book. It was a fantastic read and an interesting, somewhat original plotline. I felt that he need to spend a little bit of extra time on the last chapter, where alot of important stuff was said. However, I highly recommend this book to anyone! Some keen insight on human psycosis."
5,Couldn't put it down,"Ender's Game is the best Science fiction book I have ever read. It is more than just space ships and technology, it is a disturbing look at the human psyche. I loved this novel. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
2,"My whole family adores this book , but I didn't care for it.","My late father read this book atleast 5 times and he always raved about it. Then my older brother read it and loved it. My younger brother followed suit and felt the same. I guess they hyped it up for me so I was expecting too much. I really didn't care for it at all. Please , all you fans of Enders Game out there, don't hate me too much. Everybody is different and has different ""tastes"". I'm just trying to be honest about my impressions of reading ""Enders Game""."
3,Decent plot set in a world of sociopaths,"Most of this book centers on the training of a genius child (Ender) in a series of brutal war games in an orbiting space station in hopes that he will be able to defeat an alien enemy that once tried to invade the earth. Ender (along with just about everyone else in the book) is, for the most part, an unsympathetic conscienceless pragmatist. The book worked as a dystopia, a commentary on the inhumanity of war, etc., but I had a hard time really enjoying it since I felt no connection to any of the main characters."
3,Didn't load from Kindle Fire,Did anyone else try and order this title through their Kindle Fire and just get the title page and every page after just have the title of the book. I also tried to do the sample of this book and got the same thing. I tried another 'Ender's Game' series of book and got the exact same thing. I tried to do another book from a different series and the book came through fine.Am I the only one or is it a system problem?Thanks!
3,Enders Game,Enders Game is a great book about the struggles of a young boy to come to terms with his specific set of abilities. This book should be in every school across the country.
5,If you love space,"If you've always dreamt of being an astronaut and reading about aliens this is the book for you. I would say it is a cross between Harry Potter (it came before), The Matrix, Starship Troupers and the beginning of 300. Great book, couldn't put it down."
4,"Great book, but it doesn't deserve the Hugo _and_ Nebula.","I liked this book quite a bit. But there wasn't enough innovative thought and/or original ideas in it to justify winning the Hugo and Nebula. I guess I'm more critical than most. For a book to win both awards it has to be GOOD. Gateway by F. Pohl won both back in...can't recall. That book was fresh, innovative, and original at the time...and I liked that one more than Ender's Game. Sorry, Ender was good, but not THAT good"
5,A must read for fourth graders through adults.,I bought this book for my son and picked it up by chance to read one day. I could not put it down. I was drawn into the story and felt like I was Ender. I fought his battles and thought his thoughts. This book is magnificently well written and is a true spellbinder. It draws the reader into the story and keeps them chasing the dangling carrot right to the very last page. This book is a must read for adults as well as upper elementary students. I believe this book will join the ranks of the worlds great classics
3,Time for a little perspective....,"""a masterpiece,"" ""the greatest book ever,"" ""a science fiction tour de force""!!!These are some of the catch phrases used by reviewers here. I just have to say...get a grip! Ender's Game is a decent adolescent, soft sci-fi book that has somehow garnered legendary status within our public school system (my wife is a teacher). Yes it's an (extremely) easy read, yes it's entertaining, but it is not a masterpiece that can be uttered in the same breath with such fictional works as Dune, The Lord of the Rings, Hamlet, etc.A little perspective is required when reviewing something you really like. Step back and evaluate it with an honest eye before elevating it into the pantheon of pulp fiction legend."
4,good story,"the story was great, well told. but it was written for a younger reader, i hope the movie does the story justice."
5,Great Read,Rich story of individual accountability and growth though adversity. An exploration in the human condition and the principles of leadership. A great sci-fi context that keeps you hooked to the last page.
4,I should have read this one first.,"I read Speakers for the Dead first, but this one really fills in a lot of blanks. My friend Wendy H. turned me on to OSC and his Ender books. I really like them."
3,"Interesting, thought-provoking, sci-fi","I knew nothing about this book when I picked it up. I simply based my purchase on reviews. I wasn't disappointed but probably would not have purchased it if I would have read what it was about beforehand. With that said...I liked it. When I wasn't reading it I was thinking about Ender's world and his dilemma. The book was thought-provoking and very clever. I was sad, mad, angry and lonely for Ender. I love a book that can develop the character that well - to allow the reader to sympathize for the main character.As a girl, I would have loved a love component to the book - but other than that it was a fun read. I liked it - not a light, sunny beach read but worth it if you like military or sci-fi."
3,Good sci-fi,It has a good story with a number of fascinating ideas. However it was a little psychologically naive. A child no matter how high an IQ will have the emotional wherewithal to cope with the challenges Ender encounters. Nevertheless it was fun to read.
4,Very good sci-fi story,"This was a really good story to read. I liked how the author portrayed Ender's personality: very timid and unsuspecting in the beginning but he becomes more of a force to be reckoned with as he's thrust into adult situations well beyond his understanding. As a fan of the sci-fi genre, I like how the author describes the settings of the battle school. The only negative comment I could say (and the reason for the lack of a fifth star in the rating) is that the author chooses uncommon unisex names for his characters, so it is sometimes hard to follow who is who and get an image in your mind of the characters."
4,Brilliant!,"Before I read ""Ender's Game"" I wasn't really in to books, but Card kept me intent to read page after page. It is no doubt one of the most well written books i have ever read. I've read it several times since my first. If you like science fiction books this is definately something you should take a look at, or if u just like a very ""mind blowing"" story that's filled with twists and suprises that will keep you breathless until the end."
5,A Must - Read!!,"I read this book over the summer as part of required school reading. I didn't think I would like it at all, but I gave it a shot. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. I rarely read sci-fi or fantasy, but this book was great! I highly recommend it to someone who wants to try a new genre of books or those who want a great new book."
2,Disappointing,"This book was a big disappointment. Hearing all the hype suggesting this may be one of the best books ""ever"", I dove right in and devoted some of my limited time to giving it a read. The story seemed dry and predictable. Especially the ""revelation"" that what had been presented to Ender as training, was not. Ho hum. Who couldn't see that one coming?! I learned nothing about the enemy, therefore, I could not appreciate who it was that I was fighting and precious little of why. Interesting? Yes. Great? I don't think so."
5,Enter a new world,"One of my favorite things about books is when they take you into their world so fully that you don't want to leave. Enter's Game is a book like that. The main character, Ender Wiggins, is just who we'd always like to be, flawed enough to know that we could be like him, if only ... I hesitated to move on to the other Ender books, just because I wanted to savor this one a little longer. I read it twice, both delicious experiences; then heard about Ender's Shadow, which is a parallel story, written from Bean's point of view. Who wouldn't want to know more about Bean?Another thing I liked about the book is the deeper ethical themes, like ends vs. means (is the name Ender a coincidence?)I can't imagine, with over 2,600 reviews already, that this review will sway anyone. But a book like this is deserving of the bother."
4,sharing with my son,"my son is 14, he does not like reading and at first he sat reluctantly with me to read this book. by the 2nd chapter he was asking me to read 2 or 3 times a day and now he's reading without my help "" the voice of de dead"". He was not the only one that enjoyed the book, I'm waiting for him to finish the 2nd of the series to read it."
5,Ender's Game is Awesome,"Ender's game was the whole reason I started reading books. The story telling is great, and the characters which Orson Scott Card puts together are unforgetable."
3,One of the best & worst books I've read.,"The criticism & praise of this book I think are both generally off the mark. This book is manipulative, disturbing, & extreme. It is also gripping, powerful, & memorable. The religous or political orientation of Card is relevant, but it doesn't make the book good or bad. I think some Mormons could easily hate it & secular atheist could love it. Likewise I'm conservative & mixed on it. I hope others have a more mixed approach. This book I think inspires strong feelings, but it is possible to be ambivalent about it. In fact I think there's almost a joke moment in it where Card hints people will love & hate it. Just like Ender's parents loved & hated him."
4,a commentary on this book by a person who is a fanatic.,This is an excellent book for those who get their hype of off boy
3,Mary Sue!,"(SPOILERS AHEAD)This book is... an anomaly. I've heard it described as 'geek porn,' which is most certainly is. Ender is the worst kind of unabashed mary-sue (or gary-sue) out there. He wins every battle save for one, his enemies respect him and he respects them, everyone around him either likes him or is an evil, twisted mind. (e.g. if you don't like Ender, you're most likely evil and would rather spend your time clubbing baby seals with a plank and nail)However, the world that Card has built is... an interesting one, and though I don't like any of the characters (at all, none of them) I still enjoy reading the book for the world he has built and the various political and social realities his characters face. It's unfortunate that this world is wasted on such a talentless, whiny, black-and-white bunch of mary-and-gary-sues, but what can you do? Card can't characterize to save his life, but he's a great world builder."
1,"A really, really boring book!","I had to read Ender's Game as a summer reading assignment for my 9th grade advanced english class, and after a month or so of reading it, I finally finished it. I was happy when I finished reading it. It was boring. The book was descriptive and I could picture in my head what was happening, but I couldn't really relate to any of the characters (except for Ender, maybe -- since I'm gifted, like he is).Also, I really didn't like the awfully odd names that the characters called each other -- farteater and scrunchface, to name a couple. What is up with that?To me, the only truly interesting part of Ender's Game was when Peter and Valentine were on the nets as Locke and Demosthenes.Although there are tons of people that like and/or love this book, I'm certainly not one of them -- especially since I dreaded reading the book (and I normally love reading books)."
1,Juvenile nonsense,"Buy it for your adolescent kid if you must, and just hope he doesnt throw it in your face for insulting his intelligence."
1,Author is an outspoken homophobe,"The book is rather pedantic, it reads very quickly since the language is simple. The book is just getting good when it's over. This is probably his best book. Don't take my word on the homophobia - you can go read his horrible rant here [...]"
1,Ender's Game: virtually unreadable book,"I was interested in this book because it's gotten so many strong reviews -- both positive and negative --from other readers of Amazon's site. Unfortunately, the author's smooth command of language and subtle characterization were flawed by the fact that the text is colored dark navy and appears on black pages, thus making it virtually unreadable"
4,I Couldn't Put It Down,"The detailed plot and pace of the book makes it an entertaining read, and it masks some of the book's deficiencies. The only memorable characters to me are Ender and the military guy that first scouts him out. The other characters appear to me to be mere plot devices.(via [...])"
5,Great product,"Great product, quick delivery. Recommend highly. Just what I expected from description. Great and cordial correspondence with the customer service department."
5,By far the best book ever written,This book is full of excitment ffom the moment you pick it up. You almost seem to become one with the lead character Ender Wiggin. It's about the struggle to overcome loneliness and fear. by far the best book ever written. If you haven't already I would definately check it out.
5,Fascinating Read and Reread,"This is one of those books you burn through in the first read, then pick it up again several months later to reread it at a slightly slower pace. Each time, you pick up a little more nuance and a broader overall picture of the story. Ender's Game is easily one of my top 5 reads!"
4,A fascinating book...,"A very good book. I found Ender's psychological stress to be very realistic, and truly felt for him.There are only two problems with this book. First of all, Mr. Card, you fail to distinguish between intellegence and creativity (creative people tend to have higher than average IQs, of about 120, but many geniuses lack creativity, and vice versa), although Ender was obviously both (which does sometimes happen).The other problem is that the genius strategies are mostly limited by the fact that the author is NOT a genius. They're not dumb, they're intellegent, but when you have an entire battle school of geniuses at work I believe you'd do better than ""in space any direction can be up"".Beyond that, the book is pure classic."
4,great item,"Perfect condition as described, shipping was slow, I anticipated it arriving sooner for summer reading project, otherwise,perfect"
3,"Highly entertaining, and punctuated by a few true gems.","Ender's Game is a highly compelling if slightly adolescent page-turner which, in addition to an entertaining plot, has a few excellent and truly original concepts. In some ways, Ender is a kind of teenage Howard Roark (see Ayn Rand's ""The Fountainhead""), but is several degrees more entertaining, several steps back from the abstract abyss, and at times, however, even less psychologically plausible. One of the most interesting concepts, and a profound thought experiment for the development of identity in the digital age, is a pair of teens who become influential world leaders despite the fact that their personae exist only on Card's nascent vision of the net, as pseudonymous personae hiding the fact that their alter egos actually are just emerging from puberty. Well worth it, but do not give in to the temptation you may feel to read the sequels, which are almost unrecognizably different in style, pace, and artificial depth."
5,"Read this book, give it away and keep it going.","I buy this book every few years, re-read it, and then give it away to someone that I know will appreciate it. Growing up this was my favorite book and I don't know anyone that has read it and said that it's not in their list of favorites. You do not need to enjoy science fiction to enjoy this book."
5,This book is a real winner!,"I don't read science fiction, but this book isn't really science fiction. Ender's Game is a book that makes anyone who reads it evaluate their own lives and the lives of their children.Ender is a child genius who is trained to become the next great commander in the war against the aliens, or ""buggers"". Ender goes to Battle School and learns war tactics, while the teachers isolate him and allow all other boys to tease, hurt, and humiliate him. Ender is forced to rely only on himself. Ender is then graduated to Command School, where he learns strategy and how to command the forces, not actually being the forces. The end of this book is surprising, and I am not going to reveal it. Read the book Ender's Game, and you will be knocked for a loop.This book makes you think, something that most books rarely do. Thank you, Orson Scott Card, for writing such a deep work. I look forward to reading the next books."
5,What a game it was...,"Ender's Game is one of the most unique books I've ever read. For the most part, the characters are all children; with overwhelmingly high IQ's. They are recruited by the government to be trained to fight in a war with aliens from outer space. However, since they are all children when they are recruited they are trained in the form of ""games"".Ender is the supreme genius of all the children. Along with his counterpart Bean he accomplishes only the unimaginable. I love the fact that the story is told from a children's point of view. I think it's great how Ender is an outcast because he is the ""third"" child and yet he was the perfect balance of aggressiveness and compassion. All of the ideas that surrounded this story were very well crafted. I think this book is a must read for anyone who is a fan of Science Fiction or Fantasy. I read it in one day because I couldn't put it down!"
2,"There's always someone, isn't there?","I'm sorry to say, since I respect Card's writing, that I tried three times to read this book, which has been toted as his greatest ever. All three times, I couldn't get further than the fourth chapter because of the immense amount of self-pity the main character was drowning in."
3,Don't read it unless you have to.,"Ender's Game is a good novel for the few people who actually like gruesome battle stories. This is just another author's view of what the future will be like. Ender's Game has a good plot line that leaves you in suspense. I found that the profanity was unnecessary, and not useful to the book. I am only a seventh grader at Desert Ridge Middle School, and I have much reading ahead of me."
2,Hype,"This book is worth reading, only if you are really bored. Can we say characterization? Obviously not! This is more a blow by blow of some hyped up superlative child, than an actual tale of futuristic life. Social Darwinism at it's best. A must have for every little child who thinks that they are a genius"
4,More than just Sci FI,"After reading and re-reading Ender's Game and the next three books of the Quartet, I was struck by the fact that this book seems significantly different form the others. It has less to do with philosophy and moral questions, and more to do with action and the Bugger wars. The series starts out as pure sci-fi, with some reflections on what our society could develop in to, and turns into an interesting inspection of moral questions. I am a fan of both styles. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever been called a ""nerd"". I can't really justify this, but I will say that it has a following similar to the works of Douglas Adams and Patrick O'Brian: small, but devoted. Also, I read this knowing that I am not much of a sci-fi person. However, that did not keep me from enjoying this book."
3,Journey to a time,"Journey to a time where Earth is corrupt,where small boys are sent into the military at the early age of 7, and told nothing of the truth. Human's, paranoid in fear of a huge alien race have disbanded themselves once again and split off into smaller factionns. In this excciting scifi thriller, card takes us deep into the bowels of spaace and back out again. Wonderfully descriptive and good for any rainy day."
4,Enders Game Review,"Ender starts off as alittle boy. He is a third child which is not common. And there is a war going on between the buggars and the human beings. The army is looking at him cause there is a war about to be comming, and they need someone to lead the army.He starts his training as a little boy and they make it really hard on him. They make it hard out with him through the hole story. The book is alittle boring at the begining but by the 5th chapter you will not stop reading it. It has many action scenes in it, as well as drama. The writer brings you into the book, And makes you want to read more about it."
5,This started my interest in Sci-Fi,"Up until Ender's Game, I had never read a science fiction book. WOW, was I blown away. Even my wife, who never would have considered reading science fiction read it in one reading. I have read many science fiction books since, none, save Hyperion, can compare. It is the best of its genre."
3,Weirdly good,"I enjoyed the book and the storyline. However, some of it felt a bit drawn out. The ending was so swift. Literally a lifetime in one chapter and yet the beginning explained every feeling and motion. Overall, it is worth a read."
5,sheer brilliance......,my mum read enders game loved it so she gave her copy to my brother he loved and lent it to me and suprise suprise i loved it.Card has a very unique style of writting that really does captivate the person reading it into a gritty world of where young genius children hold the key to the earths victory against an alien race called the buggers.Its a tale of a young genius child called andrew {nick name ender} who is the child destined to defeat the buggers.this book isn't a childrens book but a book that can be read young adults.most people who read this book will admire the incredible description that card puts into his work which really helps you imagine battle school and so on.But one of the greatest achievments card has sucseeded in was making a twist that really is quit hard to guess.this book i recommend as highly as i can to anyone.sheer brilliance!!!!!!!
5,Love it or Hate it...,"you really can't ignore it. I have loved this book since the first time I read it. The story, in all its varieties, intrigues me.Particular to this version, however, is a superb author's forward. I learned so much about the story and the motivation behind the story by reading this forward. As he (Card) says herein, the real story is not what is written, but what YOU and I make together with him when we read it. The true story is the joint creation of our minds. Reading this intro makes this version even better than the others I have read. A definite must-have."
5,An amazing twist! Well thought out!,"I didn't see this book coming. A great book for all ages, interests professions! My husband and I read it at the same time and loved it!"
5,What an unbelievable book,"I could probably write a book about how incredibly intense and powerful this book was. I read this on advice from 4 of my friends (simultaneously, to boot), and have to say I was reluctant because of the ""sci-fi"" stereotype in my head. However, this book blew past all of my reservations and is one of my all-time favorite books, one I would recommend to anyone, and I mean anyone, to read.Orson Scott Card shows a stunning understanding of human nature and the plot twisted and was so amazingly real that I read it straight through in one night without a pause.Read the book, and if you are not a shallow fool (and perhaps even if you are) you are bound to enjoy."
5,Best Sci-Fi Book Ever,"Ender's Game is the reason I was drawn into sci-fi. The coming of age of a military genius in a fight for Earth's survival is simply fantastic. Orson Scott Card is great at character development and is able to actually make the reader like the characters he writes about. Also, the battle sequences inside the school were easy to follow and very exciting. This book is what I compare all sci-fi against and not many can hold a candle to this book."
5,Great Book!!!,"I picked up this book at the advice of a friend. I read it, and loved it...then lent it to a friend. Everyone who read it gave it to a friend to read...and everyone loved it. I read the rest of the series and it got a bit ""crazy"", but this book is one you dare not pass up!!!"
5,Simply Amazing,"I was required to read this book in High School. While I have enjoyed reading for most of my life, this book did much more than give me something to read. Through Ender's Game I was able to understand that every situation is different to every person. It was through this book that I am able today to see both sides of an arguement. When any of my friends graduate high school OR college this book is, at least, part of their graduation present. I have read the entire series (so far) of Ender, but this one is entirely different in its importance on me."
5,Simply Inspiring,"I can't think of any other book that has had more impact in my life. It might be because I was the lonely kid that received praise from my teachers and then, in turn, evil and distrusting looks from my peers.It is a requirement for all my closest friends to read this book not just to enjoy such an intense and revealing book but also to help them understand who I am since I have drawn Ender's experience into my life; it has become part of who I am.Everyone that I have recommended this book to and who have read it started and finished reading it within days. They have thanked me for leading them to such a thought-provoking and introspective gaze through the eyes of a little boy-genius. Simply inspiring."
5,The Best Book Ever Written,"There is no other way to put it. I have read other science fiction books, those who appeal to adults OR children, but never one that quite did what Ender's Game did.Throughout Ender's training in battle school, the teachers barrage him with tests that can't be won, challanges that can't be overcome, and obsticals that were to great to break through, and yet Ender finds ways that the teachers, or you would have never thought of. This child hero is the hero that appeals to children, and some adults.While on earth, the sibling of the boy wonder do their part to fire up the minds of the adults that hold politicial power overthe world. How these children deal with the problems facing Earth is definently how this book appeals to the adult readers. This book is great on its own, and better if you read the entire series.You can't go wrong reading this book."
5,WOW,"as a school project i had to read a science fiction book. I chose Ender's Game. I was expecting it be a pretty boring book but i was so wrong... u should surley read it... i was suprised cause i dont like many books, but i have to say this was one of my favorites -;- -;- -;-"
4,Almost,"This is probably one of the most well written books that I have ever read, very intruiging, and interesting. However despite the author's explanations in the beginning of the book, he does not manage to make the characters people. He obviously is trying to delve at emotions, and the like, but the characters come across without the genuine, human feel, that is needed for a sense of completion in any novel. A very good read, but the characters do not satisfy."
5,Excellent Sci Fi Book -- One of a kind,"This is my favorite Science Fiction novel!!! Orson Scott Card does a great job keeping the reader interested.Ender Wiggin is chosen by the IF (International Fleet) at the young age of 6 to undergo intense training on a space station. At such a young age Ender's life is full of hardships, and he is constantly being pushed to his limits. Time is of essence because Ender is mankind's last chance to be saved from alien invaders (Buggers). The big question is whether Ender going to succeed in his training where other's have failed? There is a nice twist at the end of the book that took me by surprise. You will enjoy reading this book!!!"
5,Ender's Game grabs you by the teeth and doesn't let go...,"Earth has been attacked by an alien force known as the ""buggers"" because they resemble a hybrid of humans and ants. They nearly destroyed us, now its time for us to retalliate, if only we had a commander...I am not an avid reader yet i loved reading Card's work. It snatches you and does not want to let go!Ender's Game is a thrill ride, loaded with action, action, and more action!! Not to mention amazing plot twists... This book is great for anyone, though i would caution parents in letting young children read it, due to the sparse crude language and intense fight scenes.Ender's Game flys by, it is a quick read and not necessarily a small book. Once you pick it up, you won't be able to put it down, i'm already planning on reading all of the books remaining in the series, i can't wait to get started."
3,It isn't nearly as bad or as good as they make it sound.,"I hold true to the fact that non-geniouses can never write about one. But this book certainly came close.I was impressed by many parts of this book, like the believeablity of the school, but i was also a little let down by some elements, such as the way children acted and the lack of descrpistion about one or two things.I kept an open mind about the entire science fiction thing. I'm not a big fan of so much sci-fi in one dose. But the finer points of this book completely escaped me.and it's okay for kids, if your escpeaclially worried about that, remember it's not real, and only an escpeically emotional child is going to really be affected by it. Oh, that's abit harsh.The voices in your head aren't real, but they have really great ideas.-Happy Bunny Qoute"
5,OH MY GOSH!,"this is the greatest book of all time. I'm not really into science fiction, but this book took my breath away! it is science fiction, but it isn't just shoot em up, it has feeling.I would definetally read this, Even if you don't like the review, you have to give this book a chance, it will suck you right in!"
3,"Good book, bad author",I very much enjoyed the book. I was looking forward to reading the rest of the series until I found out that Card is on the board of directors for the national organization for marriage. I cannot support an author who opposes the rights of others. If this had been in his bio on Amazon I would not have purchased to begin with. 5 stars for the book 0 stars for the author.
2,For insecure children (of all ages) only,"Notice how childish the reviews that rate it ""10"" are? Gushings of ""the BEST book ever!"", inability to see a relationship between realism and Science Fiction, the joy at finding finally something ""plain"" and ""simple"" to read? If Star Trek novels are waaay too intellectual for you, Ender's Game may be the literary Barney you can finally grasp. A nice, heart-warming story with no scary new ideas to struggle over. However, adults will want actual content in their reading material"
3,Quite slow,"Although it's beginning is quite promising and the end gives you food for thought, the book lacks the needed action and deep storyline from page 80 to 280."
1,Ok,Just an OK read. The final chapter was a terrible letdown. A few writing classes might help Mr. CARD get over his preachy style
4,GOOD!,Book was in very good shape ! The book itself wasnt one of my favorites but was an okay reading for those who like science fiction.
5,Science fiction that remembers your humanity and your God,"Ender's Game is more than the story of an earth that grooms a super-genius boy to mastermind its battle against seemingly hostile alien forces. Ender's Game is a book that initiates a conversation on the sanctity of life of all sentient creatures. How would we react to an alien intelligence that we did not understand and did not understand us? The answer to that awesome question is here as Ender Wiggin takes us along on his journey to insight and wisdom, even facing the worst of situations. Many people have thanked me for recommending this book, as I have thanked the person who recommended it to me. Thank you Anne Scott Miller"
1,Overrated,I'm not sure why Ender's Game is rated so highly. It does not really introduce any amazing concepts. The main character being good at video games does not really excite me.
2,I am in the minority here.,"Well, I must say that I was less than pleased while I was reading this book. It was recommended highly so I bought it. I found the plot to be predictable, boring, and transparent. Ender was an adult dressed up in kids' clothing, and I couldn't connect at all. The theme of superior children is frequently seen in SF literature and has been done much better and more subtly than this. Read Barnes' ORBITAL RESONANCE or Palmer's EMERGENCE instead"
5,Can I double the stars?,"This is simply the best book written for boys from age 8-9 and up. Not to say that girls won't like it - it is a great story, with a truly engaging plot and a hero that you just have to root for. I turned all three of my kids on to this book, and my ""reads to live"" daughter probably loves it more than her brothers. But if you have a boy in your life who doesn't like to read - this book could turn that around. It is easy to read without being simplistic; Ender is a kid that anyone can relate to; and the hurdles and tests he faces are enough to keep you turning pages all night. And here's the dealclincher - Ender's Game has a very strong moral core in the story that resonates and makes you think. Okay, I know Ender's game is not great literature, it may not even be great writing - but it is a truly great book."
4,"good...really, really good","They told me over and over to read this book. I kept finding reasons to put it off. What a mistake. This is a fantastic novel. The quality of the story and the writing is well above that of the average published author. However, the characters seem...well, like characters. Not quite so real. Nonetheless, this is a very enjoyable read, and it is almost guaranteed to hook you into the series."
5,Unputdownable,"If you need any reason to read this book, scroll down the 12 or so pages of tens. 'Nuff said"
2,Little Boys,"This is a great story for people who like little boys. I was creeped out by the premise and was very uncomfortable with the relationship between the trainers and the boys, the hero in particular. ""Ender"" suggests enuendo, and not in a socially acceptable context."
4,"Ender's ""not so fun"" Game",Ender's Game was tedious reading. However... it's an original story with a great ending.
1,How do so many of you enjoy this?,"well, i'm not sure how so many people enjoyed this book, perhaps it was not the right day for me to pick it up and read it. but seriously, it was disturbing....definately not something i will be giving my kid brother to read any time soon...naked children, child wars, lies and deceit, and more!rather insensitive towards real world issues-this is not just a game happening in sci-fi books, has anyone looked in the news lately, ie. child soldiers in liberia?"
1,How did this piece of $ h ! t win the Hugo award?,"This is probably one of the worst books I've ever read. Not just SciFi either, but in all of fictional works I've read. I am a big SciFi fan so naturally I was drawn to this book based on rave reviews and endless praise. The plot of the book has already been explained ad-infinitum in the 2000+ 5 star reviews on this page so I won't add to redundancy. All I can say is that Card MUST of intended this book to be for the 15 and under crowd because there is absolutly no way that this would be taken seriously in by adult Science Fiction reader.I read something funny in one of the other reviewers pages comparing this to ""DUNE""....yes, you read that right, ""DUNE""...... are you serious?.....Why don't I compare some R.L. Stine to Tolstoy? Or some Nancy Drew to Stephen King?Don't fall for the hype if you are expecting a rewarding SciFi read. ""Ender's Game"" is junk you'd find in ""HighLights"" magazine.Stay away from this waste of paper."
2,Unbelievable and predictable,"I'm sorry, I just didn't like this novel. I found it unbelievable (seven years olds doing all that! Come on!), predictable (like everybody except Ender himself didn't all see THAT ending coming), and obviously written and with sequels in mind (which I refuse to waste my time reading). It's a good book for young teenagers, but not for us 30-somethings, and CERTAINLY undeserving of the Hugo and Nebula awards!"
4,Ender's Game,"Ender's Game is well written and an interesting story about the younger years of a gifted boy. The boy struggles with his gift and the journey he must complete in order to save mankind.Once his mission is complete the story ends shortly thereafter, leaving me with a sense of loss. I had become very empathetic to Enders pain."
5,Great book,Not much of a review but I just finished this and really enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend reading it if you are into science fiction.
4,Excellent Effort From A Brilliant Author,"At first, I only read Ender's Game because it was part of the requirements for my English course.Now I thank myself for being in that class! Enders Game is an innovative masterpiece from that wonderful author, Orson Scott Card. It thoroughly examines the life of a particular unpopular boy named Ender, his tough training in Battle School and his endearing relationship with his sister Valentine.Never before have I read such a dramatic and well-scripted science-fiction book. The characters were very believable and at times one felt they could connect with Ender. Card should be congratulated for this novel and commended for a great effort. Anyone with a liking for science-fiction books should read this book."
5,This book is the most incredible book ever written.,This book is the best I have ever read. It shows a struggle that nobody sees except those that have seen a similar situtation. The feelings that you get are stronger than I have ever felt in reading.
5,This is Science Fiction,"I don't know what else I can say that hasn't already been said about this book. This is science fiction, this is one of the first books that really drew me into this genre. Before this I was always a fantasy reader, but that has greatly changed since reading Ender's Game. This book started off a year for me where all I wanted to digest was this universe. I read all of the books in the Ender series and the Shadow series and since this book Orson Scott Card has become one of my favorite authors. If I was going to recommend a book to someone new to the genre this would be one of them."
5,Best Book!,"One of my favorite books ever for years and years and years! It only comes second to Ender's Shadow, which is a parallel and has to be read after Ender's Game. Enjoy!! For ALL ages. Well, maybe nine and up : )"
5,Ender's Game,"First time reading this author, excellent story line, I have since read the 2nd and 3rd book in the series because they are so good. Great characters and underlying human nature woven into a science fiction novel. Read it."
2,Disappointing,"Boring, uninteresting, and plagued with an early elementary writing style another reviewer generously called ""staccato"". I wouldn't say the read was a waste of time, but it just barely cleared that bar."
5,Why did no one give me this book years ago?,"Having blown off life, spouse, and cats on Sunday in order to read cover to cover Ender's Game, I was left feeling cheated that no one had given me this book earlier in life and demanded that I read it. On my brief breaks from the book to forage for food in the fridge, I refused to speak to my spouse as I didn't want to come out of the world created by Card in this must-read book.I'm not a sci-fi fan by nature and so wasn't expecting much. But I was hooked from page 1 and never looked back. I'm off to the local library to see if they carry the sequels."
1,STUPID!,"Ender's Game bore me to tears. It doesn't have any point to the story at all. The entire story is about a huge video game war with bugs. Blah, Blah, Blah... Please don't read this book. You'll thank me later."
1,INCREDIBLE,"Incredible schlock, that is. Totally without merit.I soldiered on to the end, hoping for some redeeming feature, and found none.Tiresome, repititious nonsense.And, to my amazement, several thousand Amazonians found it significant literature.But, then, Harry Potter never made any sense to me,either.So sorry."
5,"It is extremly well written, and touches to soul.","I recieved Ender's Game from my English teacher last week. She loaned it to me because she knows that I want to be a Navy Pilot, and am very interested in the military. I read the whole book in two days at school. I read it in between classes, during my classes, on the bus, and at home. The truth is I couldn't put it down. I am usualy reading five books at a time and very rarely does this happen. I liked the book so much, that after finishing it, I ordered Ender's Game and the other three books in Card's saga so I could have my own set. It shows us just what humans are capable of and what the individual can achieve. The insight to Ender's incredible military mind and leadership skills is exceptional. Card is a true master at weaving an extraordinary story line with the best characters imagination can fathom. I hope some day I can shake your hand Mr. Card. It would be an honor."
4,A great story!,"Ender's Game is one of those good books that you won't stop reading. The description of the action in this book is wonderful. However, the characters get a little dull for their age."
1,very boring and juvenial,it is a kids' book but it is no harry potter. with all the bullying at schools are going on. why do we need more books like this one? i would not even recommend this to children!
1,Sample way too short,"The sample for this book is absurdly short. Nearly 90% of it is taken up by the author's introduction. The actual story part of the sample is only 5 pages long. I was seriously disappointed by this. Five pages is not nearly enough to tell me if the book is worth buying. Next time, someone should really pay attention to how much of the actual story is included in the sample."
1,wth,Ok wth I downloaded this book on my kindle and it wont let me read the book at all. All I am able to view is the title page. This is the first book I actually payed for and not got for free or used my prime account for and it doesn't even work...
3,"Good, but not superb.","I'm writing this review simply because I feel this book hasbeen ""hyped"" by its fans as being better than it actuallyis. Card's book has a few interesting points to make, and ram them home effectively. However, although the story is exciting on a purely ""action/sci-fi level"", most of it never rises above being just that. I feel that the same points Card make in this book (and some of them are very good), could have been made stronger and more concise in the space of a few short stories. Don't misunderstand me: It's funny and exciting and a fast and entertaining read, but it isn't ""great"" literature. It's entertainment. Good entertainment, but entertainment nonetheless."
4,Entertaining.,"This book was exactly what good books are supposed to be: captivating, thought-provoking, and uniquely imaginative. It's not a long book, but it is addicting; once started, it reads very quickly.There were a few things I didn't like, though. One of them was the continous use of fart-related slang. The other was the post-cold-war setting. Yes, I know, Card had no way of knowing that the Soviet Union would fall and there would be no Second Warsaw Pact. But it did detract just a little from the story's realism.I'm not a die-hard sci fi fan (I don't like to be limited by genres) but Ender's Game remains one of my favorite books. I didn't give it five stars because that would imply that this book was as close to perfection as any book can be. It wasn't, but it was still a fun read and I'd recommend it to anyone, science fiction lover or not."
5,Great book,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He isn't much of a reader, but he has really enjoyed reading this book. I would recommend this to anyone."
2,"""Unrealistic"" and predictable","I won't pretend that I know how a 5-year old genius' mind works, but I'm pretty sure it isn't as depicted in this book. Card prefaces the most recent edition saying that many people are turned off from this story by the way he characterizes the children; well, count me in. I felt more like I was reading about the thoughts and actions of teenagers. Plus, I was able to guess the ending approximately halfway through. No real surprises here. It's a great idea carried out with little creativity, ala Michael Crichton."
2,surprisingly disappointing,"Here are my random observations. I originally gave this book 3 stars, but after thinking more I had to downgrade.I thought I would like this book, but it was hard to get past the basic premise. I never understood why the hero had to be a 6-year-old child. He didn't talk like a 6-year-old and he wasn't treated like a 6-year-old, so in my head I had to repeatedly force myself to imagine one.I thought the ending was atrocious. When I had about 15% left, I wanted it to be over. It got long-winded and didn't flow with the rest of the book.I'm not one to see sexual innuendo where it's not meant to be, but the amount of nudity seemed weirdly intentional, especially since it involves young boys. Boys were often taking off their clothes or running around naked or showering or wrestling...Awkward...I won't be reading more of the series."
3,Definietly overated,"Besides this book is easy to read, the plot is plain and uninteresting. It doesnt worth 5 stars."
2,ENDERS GAME THE LITERARY ROOT CANAL,"The only thing worse then reading this book is a root cannal. I have been assigned to read this book and dreaded every line of words. The book has little to no bases and keeps you struggling through the whole thing thinking it might have gotten better, but nobody should read this book who is above the fifth grade level of reading. The only reason I gave this book a 3 is i had found the little bases it had in the beginning was alright. It had been good with full detail in the beginning. I WOULD USE THIS BOOK AS A COASTER INSTEAD OF A BOOK TO LEARN IT WAS WORTHLESS."
3,Too much hype for sure!,"Geez, I was told that this book was so amazing and it was compared to Dan Simmons and his Hyperion series. PLease, please, please! This book could have been read in 3rd grade!This was such easy reading and I never really felt ""there"" in this book. It lacks depth in character and environment. It was, however, entertaining to read. I continued to read the next three books and they seem to be written by a completely different person! They are much better written but they still are not totally engrossing. Good book(s). Not great.Those of you that truly want to be challenged on a totally magnificant level while being amazed at the story, read Hyperion! Sorry Orson."
3,Enders Game,"I thought that Ender's Game would be an interesting book because I'm the type of person who likes science fiction books, but when I read the first few chapters and I wasn't really inerested. It wasn't really interesting, but it was just ok for me. For everyone I wish it could have been more exciting for me. I think I would recommand this book to people who really like science fiction books.Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1)"
2,Disappointed,"Some elements of this book were intriguing - use of genius within modern society.Others were below cliche. The alien portrayal was one of the most ridiculous I have ever run across (really, a civilization like an ant colony that conquers galaxies?). The plot was like a balloon that burst halfway through the book - really, all the video games were real battles? And since when do adults let 10yr old geniuses determine the fate of mankind? One farce after another. And 3 genius siblings that sit around and determine the fate of the world, both militarily and politically?In a word, this author needs lots of room to grow."
2,Has not aged well,"I loved Enders Game when I first read it as a teenager and maybe that is the best time to appreciate this coming of age SF story. I read it again now as an adult and I almost wish I hadn't. The story is still good but the writing (which I remembered I loved) is simply not there and neither are the characters. Ender and his siblings, who become such giants in the world, are not nearly as interesting as they should be and for me that is the real problem with the novel.So I would recommend it for teens, not for adults. By the latter measure, it falls well short."
5,First read the novella,"The novel is powerful and moving, but not perfect. This is because it does not have half the impact of the original novella by the same name first published in Analogue. The novella is perhaps the best piece of fiction I have ever read, and I have read about two thousand science fiction books. Also, if you like Orson Scott Card, you might try to find something from Cordwainer Smith."
4,Very Good,This is the first science-fiction (although there haven't been many) book I got hooked into. I thought it was very good and it will probably make me want to read more science-fiction.
5,First book in years to put me awe!,"Normally when I read a book I will like it for one of two reasons. 1) Great Plot. 2) Great themes, messages, characters, etc.. Until last week I had never found a book to do both. Ender's Game was the first. I found it completely facitinating, disturbing, Shocking, and in the end satisfying. Since I finished reading, I have recommended this book to all of my friends."
5,One of the best books I have ever read!,"Six year old, Andrew (Ender) Wiggin is selected by the Starways Congress for special military training at an elite military school. As a kid genius he surpasses all their expectations in the war-games that he participates in and eventually commands in. But unknown to him, while is playing these ""games"" he is actually controlling something much greater than he knows."
5,Ender's Game is right up there w/ the greats,"This is one absolutely excellent book! In my oppinion, this is right up there with Dune and the Foundation Trilogy. Definitely read this book if you have any interest in SF, military theory, or even plain human nature. Forget the rest of the series, though.-"
4,awesome sci fi,"This book rocked. I don't feel like getting into an indepth review, but i'll put it this way. If you liked Dune, or Star Wars, or Lord of the Flies, or even Startship Troopers (the book),then you'll love this book. It's very well written, with engaging characters and great environlment, loads of battle scenes and quick pacing. So read it, okay."
3,"Fair, but slow","I had to read this book in class and most of my classmates enjoyed it. I, however, did not. It was slow and predictable, contained precious few original ideas, the battle room was a good one, but the reading was dry. The book is nothing spactacular, don't bother with this one.-m-"
5,select buzzword,First of all I'd like to say that there are 2 things wrong with other reviewsthis is in a genre called science FICTION!if you're concerned about realism I hope you didn't read 2001and second the book's simplicity masks the underlying messages that you interpret in your own way.other than that loved it bla blah blah
5,Thought-Provoking,"""Ender's Game"" by Orson Scott Card is, in my opinion, one of the best books of the time, despite the fact that it was first written over twenty years ago. The characters are memorable, the plot intense and interesting. This book is a must-read for everybody. Whether you are an adult, a teenager like me, or even as young as ten, you will love it. In it, the Buggers, an intelligent alien species, are a threat to humanity. They have already struck twice with devastating consequences leaving the world on its knees. But, this has created world peace for a short time, for fear of a common enemy. The International Fleet is testing and taking the best and brightest children, starting at age seven, and bringing them up into space for military training. The adults are hoping to find a boy that they can train to beat the Buggers, but now, time is running out. Their best bet is Ender Wiggin, but can this boy save the world?"
5,Excellent Book,"I enjoyed reading this book very much and I'm not a SciFi fan. By the number of reviews for this book, you know how enthusiastic people are about this book so I won't go into details. I was ready to give up on this book after reading the first quarter of it. It did not spark my interest at all. But I kept reading and things got very interesting. It was definitely one of the more memorable books I've read. I am going to read the rest of the books in the series."
5,A worthy beginner to a stunning series,"I picked up Ender's Game on impulse because I'd heard so many gret things about the book. I was hooked from page one and barely put it down until I was finished. The plot is a creative one, and extremely well written. Ender is an interesting character, as are his siblings, Peter and Valentine. They are all deep, and easy to sympathize with. (Peter took some warming up to, as others can verify, but in the end, all I could feel was pity for him.) The ending left me hanging, and I raced to find the others. (If you want to know how I felt about those, you'll just have to go to their review sections.) All in all, a wonderful book. Read it soon!"
4,One of THE BEST,"Ender moved me beyond comparison.A real classic in SF, and rightly so.What else is there to say than truly magnificient."
4,GOOD ENDING,i have read only 2 of his books ender shadow and the one after it. those books were very well written but i didn't get connected to this book like the others. ender didn't seem to be a good hook for me but i loved the ending there is so much compassion that this main character has. great read
5,GREAT READ!,"This is one great book! I read it in 3 days and I am only 13! In my school it is consered a classic along side ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" and "" David Copperfield"". (And i thought ALL classics were boring) I recomend this to absolutely everyone, even if you hate science fiction."
4,A very enjoyable read,"After reading Ender's Game my initial reaction was: a great book but way too short. The story was tremendous, well written and intriguing but the pacing was a bit too blinding. For those who haven't read it, especially fans of science fiction, this is definitely a must read. That being said, the book travels at light speed through major, indeed world shaping, events. Too much happens too fast. And, although Card defends his scant descriptive prose as ""American Plain Style"" it pretty much boils down to bland writing. By no means ""bad"" writing - Card is considered one of the best in his trade for good reason - but the book is lacking in that regard."
5,Started My Ender Addiction!,"I loved this book! My friends have been recommending it to me for years and I finally read it. I got hooked on the series and have read eight of the books so far. I actually liked Ender's Shadow a little better than Ender's Game, and First Meetings also stands out for me. I'm glad I finally read it and now I recommend it to my own friends who have even a remote interest in science fiction."
3,It's Okay,"Spoilers: Fairly boring through the first 2/3 of the book. Genius kid goes to military school, practices war games, and deals with inner demons. Then, he graduates. From there, the book starts to pick up and finally presents a great surprise finish.I can understand how this book won awards years ago, but, after reading more modern and much better sci-fi and fantasy books, it just seems ok."
4,AN ENJOYABLE READ THAT TEACHES YOU ABOUT HUMANITY.,I enjoyed this book because it was always surprising me.It showed me that even the most unlikley of people can do what they never dreamed of even if you are picked on as so many of us are.It also taught me that if you get in to deep with something you loose your self in the end.Dont miss out on this sci-fi tear jerker!
4,Coming of Age Sci-Fi Story,"Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a very good Sci-Fi story, but I am giving only 4 stars because there are better books out there. This is more of a coming of age story suitable for younger Sci-Fi readers. Those who expect a techno Sci-Fi thriller may be disappointed."
5,Wonderful Science-Fiction: Can't Put It Down,"This is an absolutely wonderful work of science fiction. I bought Ender's Game and the rest of the Ender Quartet, without knowing what they were about, but I was pleasantly surprised. Orson Scott Card is a master of weaving tales of intrigue and of creating truly deep and interesting characters that you grow to love. Never have I encountered better character development than in Card's work.Ender's Game is a terrific book, but I ended up wanting so much more. I felt like I wanted this book to be twice as long, and it seemed to end way too quickly for me. It also seemed to be a little more character focused than the other books, which can be good or bad. Overall, a superb book. The whole series is a must-read for anyone with any interest in science-fiction."
5,Card is a genius!,"This is the best Science Fiction Book i have ever read. It captivates the reader's interest and there are suprises and plot twists. It is a highly original plot and executed very well. The book has a good resolution and the very end was a nice lead-on to Speaker for the Dead...I am a girl and have no complaints about the book. Women arent allowed into battle in real life, so where's your complaint? And the training they were undergoing had almost everything to do with physical exercises as well as mental exercises. While i agree that girls couldve done everything that the boys did, it's a work of fiction...Good work Card"
5,Ender's Game,"Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a great book! Once I layed my hand on it I coudn't put it down. This book was the best book I have ever read. What I liked about this particular novel is that It is action packed from start to finish. This book is long but it keeps your attention. Ender was a great character because he was smart and serious, but he still managed to make you laugh. My favorite part was when he was fighting in null gravity. I will always remember the fighting scenes because of the way they were described. Overall I think the ending was perfect. I never expected for it to be this good. But I'm not going to tell you. I leave it to you to read this must read novel."
5,Ender's Shaodw,"The great work in this book is not what it's talking about, it's how it was written. Often contains surprising reactions."
4,I usually don't read Sci Fi as a rule...,"_Ender's Game_ is highly energetic. Card's juxtaposition of moral dilemmas, political intrigue and action/adventure is first-rate. Multi-faceted but not convoluted. You will want to read further in the Ender series."
4,Captivating,"Ender has become an entity in my class. The book has become a phenom. It's amazing, a definite page turner. I finished it twice over one weekend. Ender's game is almost impossible to put down."
3,not really for adults,"if you are older than a teenager you will find the direction of the story pretty obvious. Children are the main characters and adults are to be ""mistrusted."" The aliens are a back-story to the ""drama"" of kids working togther as team. Card really needs to tackle deeper topics before he can be taken seriously. He compares himself to Asimov in the new introduction which leaves me speechless.I cannot believe the number of 5 star reviews this novel gets -- please read Neuromancer instead if you are looking for speculative insights about the near-future. Or maybe Snow Crash, but avoid this silly novel about kids who learn how to be ""team-players"""
5,AMAZING!,"Orson Scott Card is a GENIUS! Ender's Game was fast-paced and vividly detailed. It was so realistic, but had just the right amount of detail to keep you hooked. Never bored me at all. I loved it in 6th grade and still love it all these years later. This book converted me to a science-fiction lover, even though I didn't like to read much before. Wow! Definitely a 5-star book!"
5,Great book!!!,"Ender's Game was recomended to me by my best friend who has read it many, many times. At first i decided that when i finished the book i was reading i would read it. In the mean time i read the first chapter on the net and decided i couldn't wait to read the rest. My friend lent me the book and i read it in the first day! It was Fantastic! This is not my usual type of reading but i loved it. The book has some deep issues raised in it and also is just good for a read. I recommend this book to anyone, young or old. I can't wait to read more of Osron Scott Card's work. Just read the first couple of chapters and you won't be able to put it down, It's INCREDIBLE!"
3,Good not Great,"Have you ever got a book, and never really read it? I have. I got Ender's Game a couple of years ago for a book to read over vacation, and I never did. It didn't interest me at all, so I put it away and never took a look at it. I just recently decided to read it, and really wished I hadn't. It was boring and abhorrent. Ender's Game is about Ender Wiggin, the thrid in a family of geniuses along with his brother Peter, and his sister Valentine.The book is set in the future where an race of aliens called the ""buggers"" are attacking Earth. They have already invaded twice before, and are planning a thrid attack. To defend against them, the military is training kids at a young age to become commanders. All in all, this book wasn't really that absolutly terrible, but not a really good book either. I would definetly NOT recommend reading this book as a leisure read, because you'll probably end up throwing it through the window, or in the trash."
5,great book,"I especially like that this book appeals to boys who aren't voracious readers...There's a series, but I've only read this first one."
3,Maybe it was great for it's time,"First off, this is the type of book that I should have loved - sci-fi blended with YA. Ender's Game seems to meet all of the requirements of many modern novels - child hero, mystical/magical aspects, nasty bullies and clueless adults. Sadly, I ended up disappointed about 2/3 through the book. The book can be repetitive, but rushes through other situations that would have been better explored. I will give it credit for being written in the 70's. Maybe I would be like so many others and give it 4 or 5 stars if I had read it then."
5,An important and relavent novel.,"This is a ""must read"" for all sci fi fans as well as a great intro to the genre for all others."
2,So simple it's best read when you're young.,"I just finished reading this book and I'll admit, it's pretty good. I felt it was too simplistic, however, because it ""told"" rather than ""showed."" That is, I felt I was being spoon-fed most of the information, especially when Card was relating how Ender felt at various points, etc. I may be breaking the hearts of a few people but, ""Tough noogies."" The action sequences were good and fun to read but I couldn't help wishing I had read this title when I was younger. (I'd probably be touting it as one of the best books and so on, ad nauseum.) Granted, I appreciated some of the ideas contained within but I didn't feel moved as much as some people have in the past. If you like your books simple and to lay everything out for you, then read this one."
3,"I thought it would be boring, but I liked it.","I was assigned to read the Ender series in my 9th grade Gifted English/History Class. Since we were assigned to read it, I automatically dreaded it. It was a good book, though, and I was wrong. My teacher insisted we read this series, since he communicates with the Author alot, and he tells him our comments. I'm not reaaly looking forward to the rest of the series (I'm on Xenocide) but I'm not dreading it."
5,"A very interesting book,full full of thought provoking ideas","This book is very interesting and is well worth reading. This book is a perfect text book for leadership, and because of this fact I have had my squadron (Mustang Cadet Squadron) read this book in hope that they will learn something. I believe if you are at all interested with science fiction or the military at that, that you should read this book. I promise you that you will not be able to put it down!"
4,A Perfect Blend of Sci-Fi and Imagination,"This book has everything you could want: action, mystery, feeling, and imagination. It is about a seven-year-old boy, named Andrew Wiggin (or Ender), who is sent to a battle school in space where he is tought to be a leader, and how to fight fights. Sounds boring? The thing is this 7-year-old is the human races last hope against an alien invasion. He gets to think up strategies for fighting in zero-gravity, and is tested in simulators. But what happens when they aren't just simmulators anymore? That is what this book is about. So if you enjoy books you just can't put down, then go read Ender's Game."
4,Ender's Game,"ENDER'S GAME by Orson Scott Card is a wonderful book. Mr. Card wove a story that you'll love to unravel. The brilliant character of Ender has to be strong when he leaves his parents to train at the Battle School in space. There Ender must cope with rough, hateful children, and more problems then he can handle. Interested? If so, get your copy of Ender's Game today!!!"
3,So so,This book came highly recomended to me and after seeing the very good reviews I bought the book. It was a good book but I have read so many that were better. It seemed to move too fast with not enough detail. I never really thought the part about the work that enders brother and sister were doing on Earth was in any way believable. I wouldn't say not to read it but I probably wouldn't recomend it either.
1,THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ,"This has to be the worst book I have ever read. I cannot understand why anyone would give it even a satisfactory review. The authors descriptions were so vague that you could not even picture it in even the most beckoned mind. If you are considering buying this book, please reconsider and buy a little more mature book, like Curious George."
1,Most Overrated Book in Fiction,"Honestly, I cringe every time anyone recommends this as a good book to read to anyone who's looking to get into science fiction. As if Sci-Fi does not already suffer from a bad enough reputation already, this laughable revenge-fantasy book to make all those kids who were bullied and unappreciated in high school feel better about themselves has to be pushed on people looking for a read above pre-adolescent level. If you want a good Sci-Fi book, read Hyperion. Read the Foundation series. Read Dune. Honestly, read ANYTHING other than this overrated piece of drek.I might have enjoyed this book when I was 12. Unfortunately, I was too late and read it in my twenties. By then I had grown up and moved on to some real literature."
1,I can't figure out the hype,"In general I was turned off by this book. In the end, I think it is a child's book. It was quite easy to read and good enough to fill the time on my flight, but in the end, I was bothered to have read it. As someone who has experienced sleep deprivation, combat training, science training and much of what described in the book, I just found it pandering. Perhaps it is because in this age, being able to handle three dimensional thinking and movement and game play just isn't that spectacular. The world is full of people who spend hours fighting in games on-line and is also full of people who are bright enough to compose these games. I can't compare this to great writers whose work transcends science or presents philosophical context. It seems dated and naive in retrospect, but perhaps those who love it simply are impressed by things many now take for granted. This could be a commentary on the generational seperation in the wired world."
4,The most under rated and over rated books ever written?,"This book was good fun to read. It will not answer the questions of life or even come close to instructing us as to what these questions are. If you walk away from the experience of reading this book with some newly found wisdom (as many reviewers that scored this book ""10"" apparently have), you are taking this book much more seriously than it should be. This book is a fun read. For those of you who find this book to be lacking anything but drivel (as many review that scored this book ""3"" or worse), you take yourselves to seriously.This book should not be turned into more than it is. It is not hard science. It is not real. It is entertainment. Just enjoy it."
2,Polarized plot; much too politically correct,"Good novels stretch our understanding, but bad novels stretch so far and to such silly lengths that they end up breaking the entire story. The author clearly has little understanding of what childhood is, and what we as adults can take from such a carefree and simple time, and use today. Children in even the most dire and truly saddening experiences our species has to offer still remain children. Spend some time at your local Shriner's Hospital for Children to see how children who most likely will never have a chance at life, still manage to see wonder and remain endlessly curious at the world to which they are exposed. Seek your inspiration there. But for heaven's sake don't turn kids into tiny adults, present them in a sanitized, frankly pedantic and highly polarized plot, together with stories of utter silliness about taking over planets with the Internet, and expect it to be readable or even feasible."
4,Fun and smart read.,"This is a very fun read. If you like sci-fi or war novels you'll love this book. It's like Starship Troopers, but with children."
5,Page turner,"This was a fast, fun read that kept me up late at night wanting to continue reading. I thoroughly enjoyed the character development and the universe Card created in this novel. I can't wait to see it on the big screen (though I'm sure I'll be disappointed, the movies are never as good as the book)."
3,"""What's all the hoopla about?""","After reviewing all these glowing reviews, I was expecting an epic along the lines of the ""Foundation"" series, but instead, I get a little Napoleon who plays a video game and saves the world. And he doesn't even now he does it at the time! Worse yet, his sister and sadist brother influence world opinon through the web. Oh brother!!! The mildly entertaining ending isn't worth the dribble you endure to reach it."
5,The finest sci-fi entertainment i have read to date,"There is not much to say about Ender's Game that has not already been said but I can not help but to add my name to the long list of adoring fans. Ender's Game is simply the best science fiction book i have ever read. Its an emotional tour de force with something to say about human nature. I am looking forward to reading the sequals which i just ordered from Amazon.com, and i recommend that every sci-fi lover get their hands on this book!!"
5,Personality,Ender seemed to develop his own personality during the book. I feel like I know him after reading this book. The Giant game seemed to be a true view of technology in the future. Ender is the SUPER SCI-FI HERO of the 20th century. THIS SHOULD BE A FILM . IT WOULD BE A BOX OFFICE HIT AND MAKE MILLIONS.
