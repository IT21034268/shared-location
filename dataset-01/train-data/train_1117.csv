3,It's an okay little knife,"I liked the look of this knife as I was looking for a tiny utility knife to keep in my desk drawer. This one looked kind of tactical and nasty so I picked one up. It's okay as tiny knives go, but it's actually easy to draw it across the cutting surface backwards, closing it on your fingers if you aren't paying close attention. While I wouldn't call it rugged, it's made reasonably well and is suitable for very light duty use. It came with a good edge and has kept it as I have used it for opening envelopes, sharpening pencils, and cutting packing tape. I don't regret buying it."
1,dull and disapI,"I've been a loyal SOG customer for years and figured I couldn't go wrong with this knife. I did. As another reviewer mentioned, this knife is exceedingly dull out of the box-to the point where it is dangerous. Problem is the blade angle doesn't lend itself to easy sharpening and material is so cheap that it's a waste of time. I agree that a cheap hardware store knife would be not only better value, but actually a better knife.I still love my other SOG products but this one is a bust."
2,Broke after moderate use,"The pin that holds the blade to the handle snapped in half after I had only subjected the knife to moderate use. For the money, I expect something capable of taking a beating - and this knife didn't. Waste of money."
2,calculation skillsv1,This had lots of words in each problem so it is very difficult to navagate through as a non reader. Problems are very dry.
5,Great book that is straight to the point,"I used this book to write a paper on starting a business in Florida covering all the legal aspects of that business. This was a great resource. It was specific, and it also had the applicable government forms in the back! The author is easy-to-understand and comprehensive."
3,The dark sonic space-flights of Gris Gris's debut,"Gris Gris are more instrumentalists as they are musicians, one part late 60's psychadelia, one part sonic-flights, falling somewhere in between The Velvet Undergound and Hawkwind. Their self-titled constantly shifts from a dark-spacey-experimental feel, eg, Can meets Spacemen 3, to more feedback-laced psychadelia, echoing vocals and distorted guitar shrieks, falling somewhere in between The Raveonettes/BRMC and the snarling twang of The Nuggets II series. It's really an interesting fusion of styles, lots of fuzzy noise and mind-bending noodling, yet with flashes of groovy melodies and acoustic ballads. Gris Gris, perhaps the darker spaced-out cousin of The Brian Jonestown Massacre, cannot be faulted for pushing the limits, but as the BJM is about retro space-cowboy melodies, Gris Gris is about symphonic astral-travelling to the stars."
4,good psychedelic rock,"I got this at a local used CD store where I'm known very well.The owner thought I might like based only on the name (anytime he sees something with a weird name that he's never heard ofhe always thinks of me first : )I hadn't heard of this band either, but I listened to it in the store and I was hooked.This is definitely a psychedelic band, they remind me of a cross between The Velvet Underground and 60's Pink Floyd, but of course some of the songs don't sound like either of them.The lineup is a basic guitar, bass, and drums group (with a couple guest musicians on three of the tracks), the music however, is not basic at all, but often experimental and rather creative.After listening to it a few times I find the only song I don't care for is the first track ""Raygun"" everything else is great.It always feels good to find a rare gem in a used CD store, and this is no exception. I look forward to hearing more from this band in the future."
3,NICE CABINET FOR THE PRICE!!!,"Bought this Pyramid speaker to run a small pa, have also used as an extension cabinet on my guitar tube anplifier, sounds good especially for the price. works in small clubs or practice just fine."
3,good ok sound,I was very please with the rapid delivery.Speakers sound good Inside house.They could sound good in a party.
3,Worked Great for a While,"This was exactly what we needed for our front gate. It worked well for the first year - I think we only replaced the batteries once. Then it completely died. The one unit (outside) probably did get more weather exposure than intended but the internal components did not seem corroded - only the exterior screws. We have not found anything else in this price range that seems to work, so we will probably buy it again to replace for the sake of convenience."
3,Review of Chamberlain ROI2 Wireless indoor/outdoor intercom,"Chamberlain ROI2 units are simple to operate, simple to attach to surface desired and very reliable. We had difficulty with volume control. The units produce such a vibrant sound that we've told everyone who uses them to stand at least arm's length and speak in normal tone. Transmissions done this way are clear and distinct."
1,Poor. I sent it back,Direction are confusing and not accurate. No external volume or channel selection. The interior home model is better.
2,Intercom with no door bell,"The sound quality is okay, but when guests arrive at the front gate and push the button, all you hear at the inside unit is a single quiet beep (easiely missed) and not a door bell sound. Your quests have to push the button to speak (most can't figure it out). If I had to purchase again, I would try to find another product that had a door bell sound."
2,"Works great, then conks out","We bought these as a gift for my sister, who uses two sets (four units in all) in her four-story condo. Set-up was a breeze. No more running down three flights of stairs to let someone know they have the wrong house!But wait... after a few weeks, the whole thing conks out. No battery change can help you; you're stuck with a dud product. Blah."
1,These things are JUNK!!!!,"I bought these things to use between upstairs and downstairs in my home. We only used them several times before one refused to work. My son dismantled it and repaired it. We used it ONE more time and the other unit refused to work. The workmanship and quality of the electronics in the units is terrible. The sound is awful, it's hard to understand unless you speak very slowly and clearly. These things are NOT worth the money!! Do yourself a favor and buy a megaphone or something!! We've gone back to shouting between rooms, it's so much less frustrating!!"
1,unreliable product,"I bought a pair of these intercoms last April 2009.They constantly have to be reprogramed with the (learn button) inside. I called Chamberlain for a replacement unit and was told that the product was put on hold and they would not be sending anymore out, for sale or relacement, nothing? So you are stuck with a defective product. No resolution, just sorry we cannot help you from Chamberlain."
5,Wireless Indoor/Outdoor Intercom,"Wireless Indoor/Outdoor Intercom UnitsI needed two intercom units. One for outside my frontdoor and one for inside.I found the wireless units, ordered them from Pricepiggie. Delivery was very quick;I will use them again.The new units were packed very well and only took about ten minutes to adjust and install them. They worked perfectly. I am very pleased with the quality and ease of installation and setup. I didn't need a real fancy system, just something that was waterproof and easy to use, and these units are ideal for a simple intercom system.Each one has a ""push to talk"" button that activates the other unit.They are battery operated and the batteries are easy to change."
2,Very poor sound quality,"Sound isn't clear. No external volume control (you can increase the volume by flipping a DIP switch mounted on the circuit board inside, but you have to take the unit apart to do it). Luckily I bought them from Amazon so returning them was no problem."
3,NOT MADE IN THE USA,"""Product Features"" advertises ""Made in the USA"". It is not, it is made in China. I bought this one because I had purchased 4 other nozzles from Home Depot, made in China, and they leaked all over the place. If I find any more such false advertising on Amazon, I will be contacting the Federal Trade Commission and you can explain it to them !"
1,Stawberrry Basket,This product simply is a lie. My husband followed all the directions and we still have an empty basket.
1,Waste of money!,"I purchased the Buzzy Hanging Strawberry Basket for my sister for a birthday gift.However, the seed packet only had 4 seeds TOTAL in it.Very disappointing. I will not purchase from them again. If they'd like to send seed replacements that would be nice."
2,Packaging,"Buzzy Hanging Strawberry BasketThe components came in a plain brown cardboard shipping box, not as pictured. As this is a gift, I would prefer the identifiable product box."
1,Nothing grew,Planted exactly as directed. Watered exactly as directed. Nothing grew. Only recieved about 10 seeds in the packet and nothing grew. Very messy to put together and not even one sprout. Not recommended.
1,Invisible Strawberry Hanging Basket,"As experienced gardeners, we carefully set up our Buzzy grow kit, and faithfully misted the planted seeds and growing medium. We were especially faithful because this was a gift from our children, and we wanted them to be able to see their gift when they came to visit. What a colossal waste of time and effort. No seed germinated, and we hung the planter in ideal location and tended it every day.After a month, we planted Morninglory seeds, and they soon jumped up and look great.This gift might work for some, but we rather think it's a sham marketing ploy.Probably purchased as a gift in many instances - where the recipients are too embarrassed to make it known what a failure the thing is.This is, in our considered opinion, a complete sham!"
1,Needs to inform you that the seeds can germinate slowly.,"I just wish they would have told me that, then I wouldnt have had to call them and ask for more seeds, which they did not send."
1,Awful!,"I purchased this kit from LTD Commodities. It is terrible! The ""moss"" is a dehydrated block which becomes a big, soggy, falling-apart mess after you rehydrate it per the instructions. And the seeds are nearly microscopic and FEW. Are they made of gold or something that they only give you 5-6 teensy weensy strawberry seeds? Good grief! Don't waste your time."
1,"Ugly basket, no plants","Basket is ugly, chain is cheap and shiny, plastic liner shows through. PLUS, no plants came up. Seeds were expired. Transplanted some Buzzy Hanging tomato plants into and they died. Because of the plastic liner, it doesn't drain and it's difficult to guage how much water it needs. Very disappointed."
2,Stick with the Dionysian,"This recording of ""The Rite of Spring"" is appropriately raw, savage, and moving. Unfortunately, it's paired with Stravinsky's later (and lesser) work ""Apollon Musagete."" It would have been better to have included something else Stravinsky wrote in the teens, before he turned to a more neoclassical mode. Still, you can always just switch CDs after you get to the end of ""Spring."""
5,I love this book.,"This is a great book. Great. For anyone interested in solo performance, it's history and performers, this is the book. I do not know of a book as expansive, yet concise, which takes texts from early 20th Century performers like Moms Mabley and Ruth Draper to modern masters like the late-Spalding Gray and Dael Orlandersmith.Edited by Jo Bonney, a director famous for solo productions, and featuring introductions to each performer's section, this becomes a theatre book unlike any I've come across.Lenny Bruce, Andy Kaufman, Lord Buckley, Whoopi Goldberg, John Leguizamo, Anna Deavere Smith, Roger Guenveur Smith, Laurie Anderson, Lily Tomlin, etc., etc....Works are featured in fragments, specific character pieces from larger plays, and many of the performers have multiple pieces, exhibiting their styles, poetry, innovation and skill.This is a great book."
1,Hype,"Overhyped reviews by the authors of the book. There is a reason this is a 5 star book, 5 people were involved with making it."
2,Most boring album yet.,"I was counting down the days for propagandhi's first album in like four or five years to come out, and I'm kind of disappointed. Potemkin City Limits isn't even close to being as melodic as How to Clean Everything or Less Talk More Rock, and does not come close to the passion, anger, and all-around awesome hardcore on Today's Empires, Tommorow's Ashes. All three previous albums were absolutely awesome, and all in different ways. This album is very...blah. It's boring. Most of the songs are slow and not very compassionate. It seems like the members have gotten into so many other political things other than music over the past five years, that they didn't really care about making good music. It's boring and none of the songs really stand out. I recommend all three other albums by far before buying this one. Especially Less Talk, More Rock."
1,woah,"OK, what the hell happened to the good ole propagandhi that we all know and love, with their political views and messages wrapped up neatly in a snotty, in-your-face, and fast paced package? Well, personally I'd say they are nowhere to be found. I'm not trying to say that this cd is utter crap, just that I don't like it, and that I'm sorry I bought it on a whim when i saw it laying there in the record store. I've been listening to Propagandhi for a long time and this cd severely dissapointed me... It sounds as if he should be preaching a sermon instead of singing. I dunno...just my two cents..."
4,"No Clue, In A Foreign Port And A Foreign Language","I have been cruising in many different areas around this beautiful globe and I find this dictionary to be one of the few available on the market. The book is divided up in to catagories such as the hull, deck, navigation, commands, refrigeration, engine etc., although I am fluent in French and German, this book aids me immensely to navigate through the seaman's language in 10 different toungues. Sailor's terminology can be rather intimdating to some people in their own language, let alone in another foreign language. I you are planning a cruise around the Caribbean, Mediterranean, South America or Africa buy this dictionary. The only negative part about this book, is that it contains no middle eastern or far eastern languages such as Arabic, Persian, Thai, Chinese, Fiji or Indonesian. If they would have added these languages to the book, it would have been too combursome to use hold the dictionary."
4,Looks great,"When I bought this pickguard, I thought that it already had the holes for the pots drilled, but after closer inspection I had to drill the holes myself because they were not there. If I looked at the picture more carefully, I would have realized, but because of my carelessness, I did not. Anyway, the guard is a great replacement to a broken or word down one, and you can also use it as a replacement for most copies of the Fender Strat. You should only attempt to replace the pickguard if you either know what you are doing or have deatiled instructions, for it can be a daunting task the first time. Overall, I am very pleased with this product and will certainly buy from the seller again."
3,mmmmmm...........,"holes for the pick ups are not deep so certain screws, which do not come with pick guard, will stick out. I had to take my guitar, a Squier Affinity Strat,and the new pick guard to a local store to get the pick guard fixed and put on the guitar. Overall, its pretty good, as long as your willing to put out extra cash."
3,Beautiful but fragile (on the inside),"I've had my Speedmaster for four years and it's a terrific watch. A great band too. And the sapphire crystal is beautiful. The only problem is that the automatic winder has broken on mine twice within the first three years. It's been in the shop twice for a total of $375 in repairs. I've treated it like a baby, but somehow it has failed these two times. I'm not sure I'll bother fixing it if it happens again. So to anyone who wants to buy this watch (or any other mechanical watch) keep in mind it won't be as reliable and durable as your average $32 Timex."
5,One of the best trilogies ever!,"This is a wonderful book. Although the first and third books (Nightpool and Dragonbards)are also excellent, I think this is the best by far. It's about a young dethroned prince (Tebriel) who has discovered he has the power to contact dragons and help free the captive world from the tyrrany of the Unmen. It is a terrific book for young and old alike. I would recommend it to anyone who loves fanasty or a good adventure. I hope that soon this trilogy will be rereleased."
4,Great for a child,"I found myself bored because of the simplty of the book, but then again I am an adult and the books I read cast web after web of detail.If I was to read this as I child I believe I would find it to be truly enjoyable."
3,Looking for more,"I love to read and i am always looking for more. The Ivory Lyre, the second of a captivating series, was just the thing i was looking for. The book is about a prince fighting for his kingdom, a league of dragons, and freedom. The thing about books is that you pretty much always know what will happen. You always know that the person has to win, and you know the ending will be happy. That's what it was like for this book. I knew what would happen afterwards in the third book, but i only knew the last chapter. Murphy puts such a twist in the story that you have to continue reading it, and it's hard to put the book down. Still, now, i am looking for another book to read; something that will catch my interest just as this book (and her others) did."
5,I had a crush on Kiri,"I have to admit, I loved these books, and I wish they would do a reprint. I own The Ivory Lyre, but I was interested in finding the other two. Oh, and I had a huge crush on Kiri as a youngster."
1,"Item says 'Free Shipping', however it costs 4.94 with the lowest method selected","Item needs to be corrected by Amazon or store..Item says 'Free Shipping', however it costs 4.94 with the lowest method selected"
5,Simple and Convincing,I love this book because it makes baby sign language SO simple. She clearly explains the reasons to do it and de-bunks myths as well. Some of the other books are overwhelming...this one breaks it down to the key signs and the best order for introducing signs. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to sign with their baby!
4,Great place to start,"The book is great. There are a few illistrations where the hands are drawn on backwards, but it is easy enough to figure out what the correct sign is. The statisctical info in the book is priceless. Worth every cent!!!!"
2,Good as a gift.,"Overall, I was rather disappointed with this book. I'd definitely recommend something by Joseph Garcia (like this or others:Sign with your Baby - Baby Sign Language (ASL) Kit: Includes Book, How-to DVD, Quick Reference Guide). This book references his work and he does a better job, I thought, of teaching the signs and the how and when.On the other hand, this book is good to give to someone who hasn't already decided to sign, the first third of the book is devoted to convincing you that signs are good. So, if you're looking for a baby shower gift -- if the mother or father is on the fence or hasn't considered it -- this book would work well for that."
4,"Great introduction, plus some","This book is a great introduction to baby sign, teaching you the important signs first, but also providing more advanced signs for as you and your baby learn. It also provides fun games to get your child ready to learn."
4,Half of a great album,"If you like Maynard's arrangements, you will almost feel right at home with this CD. Dan plays several of Marnard's charts. The band is pretty good here, better on some tracks than others. This is my #3 in my Dan McMillion collection, only because the performances are a bit more uneven than in my top two. Still, this is better than many other more recent big band recordings you may run across. And kudos to Sea Breeze for doing a nice job on this release. But Dan...that title.....??"
1,Does not fit my squier,Unfortunately it useless as it does not fit my Squier Standard strats. Cheap quality as it bent over time and became totally unusable. Don't buy this product.
5,new bath light,"This light fixture was the last to go into what started as a dripping faucet, ending up in pretty much a bath overhaul. The directions were complete, though to a novice, might be confusing as written. The porcelain bulb sockets were an unexpected plus. They are labeled as taking up to 600 watts (I am sorry, but I do not use that bright of a light in a bathroom over a sink). I did not experience any problems during installation, and was very pleased at the extra cushioning that was provided in the packing of the product. The only real down side is that it had a ""made in China"" sticker on it."
5,Excellent Lights,I purchased these lights for my master bath. I am very happy with the quality of the product and their appearance. They updated my master bath beautifully. Buying them at Amazon also saved me money. They were $4 cheaper than the exact same product at the local home store.
5,Comfy shoes for a hair stylist,I stand all day at work and have tried numerous pairs of shoes factoring in comfort and style. These are my favorites HANDS DOWN! I've tried other styles of Skechers but I have found these to be the most comfortable. (I have fellow co-workers that feel the same way) I will continue to buy this particular shoe until they stop making it. I love them!
5,sketchers are great,These shoes were a present for my daughter. She is on her feet all day and they are working out very well.
5,School shoes,My daughter loves these shoes. They are durable and fit her foot well. I bought her both the pink and the blue striped ones. I'm sure they will last throughout the school year. A great shoe overall.
5,Like the fit,because of new problems with my feet I was happy I was able to get these shoes in a wider width. They are much more comfortable for walking for me. I am able to walk longer distance now than I did with my other shoes.
5,Love them,Very comfortable and stylish looking. They where a great purchase and i'm very happy with the price i paid. I would buy them again.
3,Love Skechers,"This is a good looking shoe. But they are narrow. I was surprised because I have bought many pairs in the past and never had this problem. The bad thing is I bought 3 pair and all of them are them same, narrow. I wish now I had bought a 1/2 size bigger."
1,spots,they have black spots on them like they had been sitting where someone was painting and have over spray on them could not find a way to contact seller
3,Scketchers Womens Premium-Wide Sneaker,A bit stiff to start with but I needed the support for rough terrain on my winter walks. Otherwise the support is where I need it and is comfortable for my toes.
5,Walking in a cloud,They are the BEST. You feel as if your walking on a cloud and the comfort is still there after 8 hrs. Love them
5,No More Foot Pain @ the hospital...,"Long days in the radiology dept. had my daughter's feet throbbing. She says these shoes solved the problem in ONE day of wearing. NOTE product detail: The ""high sole"" will make you look ""taller"" and take a few mm's off the length of your scrubs... Which can be a good thing since scrubs are typically made SO long. These are the ones."
5,Best sneakers ever!,"I've owned Skechers before and they've always been excellent. However, this particular pair is the best of all the Skechers I've owned. They are extremely comfortable and generously cut for just a medium width. I would recommend them to anyone."
5,Love Skechers,"This review is biased as I am a devoted Skecher - especially of the D'Lites. I always have ""back ups"" in my closet for when I wear out my old ones. Skechers are my ""go to"" shoe on a daily basis once home from work. I have 3 pairs constantly on the go. I haven't tried these ones yet but I can tell you that Skechers never disappoint. Always fit true to size. Comfortable from the beginning. These are NOT workout shoes people; they are casual shoes. I currently have 3 pairs I wear, and these are now being added to my back up shelf."
4,"Little narrow, but otherwise comfy","These run a bit narrow in the toes but are still comfortable. I'm short, so I like that these are comfortable athletic shoes, but also add 1.5"" in height. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase (and the price) and will be walking my feet off during my trip to London!"
4,One of the best Cds that i have ever heard.,"Most of the time when one thinks of dark music he thinks of Tool or some other million dollar bland. However, black lab is sad, funny and dark all in the same time. I would tell anyone who loves music to buy this cd."
1,Junk...nothing but junk.,"I've owned it for a year or so....tonight the key for the flywheel broke...well these morons at MTD(the ones who built this piece of garbage) decided instead of being able to replace the key, they'd just incorporate the key into the flywheel. Of course, when it breaks, then the entore flywheel needs to be replaced....made in USA...ya, sometimes I think the Chinese stuff is better...no wonder manufacturing in America is going down the tubes..."
3,Tepid filler with scattered brilliance-better rented than bought,"They short changed the reason we all get this video: Jonathan's performances. Granted, the docufiller is interesting, but belongs in a section titled ""Bonus Feature"", or ""Bio"" rather than fragmenting some entertaining out takes.Probably didn't want to pay all the royalties to get more performances included...Recommend as a rental rather than a purchase."
5,The ultimate in RPG and rock and roll parodies!,"I love this series! The author is very creative--to use rock n' roll band names and song titles as the names in the story is great! The back of the book says that ""If this were a movie, you'd have been blasted through the wall just by the music. This is loud, head-banging fun!"" Well, I happen to agree!So, pick up your copy today! I doubt you'll be disappointed!"
5,Awesome!,"Recieved the book within a week after ordering. Book arrived in a perfectly shipped package. It was brand new and was to my expectations. If ever i needed to order products from the sender in the future, i definitly will without hesitation. Great product!"
4,Exactly what I needed,"What can I say, it is a great repair manual and gives the details needed for minor or major repairs."
4,I like this CD,"Bun B has always been mah fav from UGK, and his solo release is solid... i dont have much to say since Im still checking it out, but so far is real good southern wise. grab it, you wont be dissappointed."
3,"I HEARD IT,AND I WAS NOT MOVED...LOOKS LIKE AN OK ALBUM","3 STARS ALL MOST DID NOT MAKE IT FOR ME BUT THE SONG WITH YING YANG GOT IT FOR ME,AND A FEW OTHERS...BUT NO MORE BUN B FOR ME."
3,"Not that Hot, but still good.","Trill is a different album from Bun B from UGK (One of my favorite groups of all time) with old fashion rap songs with good sound, Bun B Reminds me of the Kool G. Rap from the south, good songs on there, except for the one with the idiotic Mike Jones, still this is a fine dirty south, So I'm giving this a thumbs up."
3,Legends,"Outkast and UGK came into the game around the same time and are both southern OGs so why is Big Bois Speakerboxxx lightyears ahead of Trill.Bun Bs partner in rhyme Pimp C was incarcerated at the time of this album and Big Bois partner Dre is in Hollywood so I expected Trill to be of similiar quality no such luck.I mean after 10 years in the game Bun B is still talkin about the same s*it, the first 10 tracks are pretty good but other than the ""Draped Up"" Remix with the Houston All Stars the latter part is trash."
1,Who is this N***a?,"I'm Sick of hearing all these b**ches dissin 50 cent & G unit, That man has everything you ""local"" rappers lack!!! Ask yourself how many people buy your albums?? maybe 100,000 maybe 1million. infact add up all the albums any newyork rapper has sold bar 50, it still ain't more than 50's get rich or die tryin!!!! Now go to any country in the world and ask them to tell you your name!!!! when they don't know you the f**k ou are!!! ask them who there favorite rapper is and when they say 50 Cent, don't hate, just accept your not on his level, and never will be! This n**ga is as real as it gets, keep f**kin with him and you might get your b**ch a**es Shot!!!!!!!!!!!! Enough said."
4,Datz my Nicca,"Bun B been rip'n it for a while now, people been sleepin on my boi. This album is str8 fire. There are bout two songs I skip, but besides that this is worth it. I only wish Weezy could of got on a track. But u know how dat go."
4,Missin the PIMP! 4/5,"Bun B has always been a beast but after listening to ""Trill"" I can't help but think that something is missing. Bun B has always jumped out to me as the Texas version of Busta Rhymes, He'll kill or embarass any other rapper on their own projects but not sound as hungry on his own material. With this paired with some Cheesy Guest appearances(Ying Yang, Mike Jones, Young Jeezy)is why I can't say that it's a 5. Bun B is just giving the fans something to look forward to with the next UGK album when Pimp C or as I know him Chad(reppin Crowley, La. Not PA like most people believe) gets out of jail."
4,Classic,Classic UGK/Bun B must have. A few of the songs were annoying but most were the kind you play over and ovwer agin.
1,"Advanced? Yeah, for the novices...","The authors claim in the preface that the book covers undocumented facts and tips for SQL Server 7. Nothing could be farther from truth considering that the book is not even up to date in coverage of the newer areas. Microsoft's strategic direction for data access is going to be OLE-DB(Object linking and embedding database, as the book says!!), yet they devote more than 150 pages to the drab ODBC."
4,Very helpful,"Having basically discounted English classes during my educational years and taking very little interest in reading and writing, until recently, I decided to finally begin my own education. Certainly, just the act of immersing ourselves in a good book and penning our thoughts will improve our writing skills. This study guide although, tested me and, hopefully, did some good.This helpful book contains dozens of short stories and poems from over the centuries by both familiar and obscure authors. Each is grouped into sections and arranged in increasing order of difficulty, such as: comparison and contrast; process; cause and effect; argument; et al. The authors combine many different ideologies, philosophies, beliefs, and topics into both fiction and nonfiction. Several make for surprisingly good reads as well. At the end of each selection are challenging questions covering subject and structure, which then encourages recognition of organization and sentence structure more clearly."
2,didn't work well for me,Not sure but I just don't think this product did what it said it was suppose to do. didn't care for this.
2,Another Naiad Formula Book,"Attorney Katherine Brennan is enamoured of antiques and Annie Walsh, owner of the Cambridge, Massachusetts antiques store, The Treasured Past. When Kate's senior partner orders her to handle the divorce of his son, she is upset, but agrees to do so. When she meets with him, he tells her that he is adamant that he wants the couple's house. In the meantime, her relationship with Annie blossoms as the two begin decorating Kate's bare-as-bones house. This is another in a very long line of Naiad's formulaic publications - it hasn't varied in over two dozen years - so there were no surprises, the relationship is the same as any book published by Naiad in the last twenty-five years - different names, different occupations, and different locale, but it is the same book that Naiad always publishes. If you've been reading Naiad books for any length of time, and like the formula, by all means buy this book. But if you're looking for more, look elsewhere."
1,The End of a Career and a Life,"I'm a little surprised that there are a few good reviews for this film on here.I saw it in a theatre shortly after the death of Peter Sellers in 1980 and was saddened to think this was his last film. It was spectacularly unfunny and the last we would ever see of him (although I liked the rejuvenated Fu Manchu appearing in Elvis regalia at the climax).According to the two biographies I've read of him (THE LIFE & DEATH OF PETER SELLERS and MR. STRANGELOVE), the production of FU MANCHU was pure chaos.If you haven't seen this film, don't think you're discovering a lost hidden gem. His earlier British films are finding their way on DVD and I definitely want to check them out--and I'd recommend anyone interested in Sellers going there.Because you're not going to find much here."
1,The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu,VHS in Spanish with subtitles and wasn't what I ordered. It was ordered new. VERY UNHAPPY with Video.
3,One last Blast from the Past!,"This movie is an enjoyable campy rompwith an ending that will make you grin...or groan. Peter Sellers Freewheels the part in one of his last movie roles. All Peter Sellers Fans should own this movie! It is pretty tongue in cheek and doesnt even take itself very seriously, but thats a plus!It can be a party movie....IF youre up for a challenge of your hosting skills.If youre an elderly asian guy who wants to take over the world This IS the movie for you! Many critics have been too harsh on this film. Granted it isnt the Greatest movie of all, but It does havethat Peter Sellers wit and style!"
5,The Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu,"The product came quickly, wrapped properly and the transaction was flawless. Thank you so much. Great vendor."
3,wear a bathing suit,"When you try the widest setting on this unit, it is impossible not to get soaking wet when you set it. I bought two, because the gardena sprinklers that I have always used seemed to be getting intermittant problems, and the quality of their new units seems to be going downhill. One of the two Nelson units I got leaks horribly around the connector. I don't like the way the 3 spray types work. While you are twisting it around, you are getting soaked even more. The Gardena has a much better solution. I'm going back to them. I like their timer better too."
1,PLEASE SHUN this piece of trash,"I have bought two of these sprinklers, and use(d) them like any reasonable homeowner...to water my lawn. Well, last week, after about a dozen uses, one of them disassembled completely. Just fell apart. Oh, all the metal (pot metal, not exactly a Titanium body, here!) stayed intact, the plastic parts went elsewhere. It's in the recycly bin. The other one: 1. One of the tabs broke off so setting the watering arc became a lot more difficult (it ain't metal), 2. It only rotates through the entire set arc on the widest setting. On the mid- and narrow setting it may go through 10--30 degrees and then change its mind (and direction). It will go from the run position, where I want it, to the 1/2 hour position and I can come out after an hour and find that things are quite dry... Anybody know of a DECENT quality METAL oscillating sprinkler? This ain't one!"
3,"Bought 2, Returning 2, Trying 2 more. These didn't work.","I was looking for good quality and heavy duty. I bought 2 to water my newly seeded lawn. At first I loved them, The timer, the 3 patterns, and the weight. Then after 2 days one of them decided to stop going the full range and both of them decided not to shut off completely so I had a huge water puddle if I didn't go shut off the water. I'm hoping that these are just faulty ones because I really like them otherwise. But because I have to take them back I have to give them a lower score. They simply don't do what they say they do. Turn off. I do have to say I only paid $22 each at Menards. I probably wouldn't have bought them at Amazon's price even though they are worth it if they work. I will be taking these back and trying 2 more.Buy one and return it if it doesn't work."
3,Almost...but not quite,"I recently purchased this sprinkler as I thought it would be just the thing for my L-shaped front lawn, with it's 3 different spray patterns. I was bound to find the ""just right"" setting.Unfortunately, this was not the case.While it was a well made sprinkler and it's timer function was welcomed it had several shortcomings.At it's widest setting it did not cover anywhere near the 3750 square feet advertised. I have excellent water pressure and even fully cranked it would not match the length or the width of my old sprinkler.Another thing...This sprinkler moves very quickly from side-to-side...if you didn't shut off the water before adjusting between the three settings or even when moving the sprinkler itself you had to make a mad rush at it or else you are going to get soaked.I returned it and put my 8 year old sprinkler back into service.If you want to read that review check under Melnor Classic Oscillating Sprinkler #3200H."
1,Broke after 3 months,"Worked great when it worked!I have been using it and was doing great until the brass coupler broke away completely from the body.Although the threaded coupler is made of brass, what it is attached to is not!! It is plastic. It broke off and is now unusable. I wrote to Nelson last week but so far they have not responded. Overpriced pos"
2,"Nice Sprinkler, Short Life Span","Great sprinkler, timer function is great and the selectable patterns are a huge plus. Metal base lends to the ""appearance"" that this may be the last sprinkler you might have to buy for a while........however, after only one season it broke. And wouldn't you know it, it broke at a point where one of the few plastic parts joins the metal base. Too much to pay for a sprinkler that will not last a season. I guess I'll keep looking for that perfect sprinkler....."
3,Sprinkler Review,"I had one before, loved it but the nozzle broke.Bought this one and it constantly trickles small amounts of water out the spray holds- basically it does not shut off completely.Flexability and Timers Items are great."
1,All metal except where it counts,"Nice sprinkler in concept and the metal base is nice and leaves the impression that the sprinkler is very durable. Unfortunately the timer mechanism and the water inlet are the same inexpesive plastic found in the cheap sprinklers. As other reviewers have pointed out, the neck of the hose attachment is weak and breaks if you pull the sprinkler by the hose or accidentally trip over the hose. This is typical of Nelson products. I have one of their timers and it broke in exactly the same place. It kind of reminds me of the cars in the 1950s that were designed with controlled obselesence featurs so the car would start to rattle and squeek after a year or so. I am sure that the Nelson marketing guys wanted it to look strong and sturdy with the metal, but have a breakdown feature might cause the less clever to keep coming back year after year for a new sprinkler. JUNK design at best, Clever marketing a worst."
5,The Best How-To Book For The Home Decorator,"Elaine Ryan's book is an easy to read how-to book on decorating your home or office with color you can live with and enjoy.It gives you tips, both practical and psychological to help you use color in decorating your home. I particularly enjoyed the subtle manner in which Ms. Ryan urges you to free yourself and take command of your life, a life that should be surrounded by color."
1,Don't waste your money,I was very excited about receiving the book and the color bars. Found BOTH to be totally useless! Colors are very very limited. None matched the many colors in my home at all. The book was also not helpful at all.Don't waste your money on this junk!
4,A Research Paper In Book Form...,"I bought this to learn more about my family's heritage.Seems as though I already KNEW a lot that this book didn't even touch on.Still is a worthwhile reference. I was torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars. It isn't a 5 star book as it could use some help with flow and there is a lot of salient points that just wasn't included. However a lot of information is presented here...to give substance to the fact that Creole is a culture, a heritage. That alone gives it merit."
5,Free to be You and Me Grows Up,"Anybody who grew up with Marlo will love this book about people who really learned how to be ""you and me."" Imagine a party where the guests are John Leguizamo, Sidney Poitier, Whoopi Goldberg, Toni Morrison, and Rudolph Giuliani. That's what this book is like--having conversations with some really cool people who have some wonderful and relevant stories to tell. Just like being at a party... only you don't have to worry about what to wear!"
5,Great book about life and influence,Length:: 5:28 MinsThis is a great book and Marlo Thomas supports an excellent charity St. Jude Children's Hospital. There are several great lessons in the book. For more free book summaries please check out successprogress.com
1,A Monument To Self-Promotion,"Ms. Thomas appears on the cover but only writes the foreword. Hugh? This is a collection of famous people all thrown together and Ms Thomas, somehow, for whatever reason appears on the front cover. Self-promotion??? She seems to have dropped in for the party and the reader is left wondering if she really did any work on the book? What am I buying said the wise man? The collection of stories asks us to buy into the idea that the right words said at the right time will make a life-long difference to a person. Tell me, could the ""right words"" be said at the wrong time?? Isn't the timing of a message in large part make it the right thing to say. When you really think about it the premise of the book needs some work."
1,Not For Me,"It is very tiring to read. One story after the other. I wish when publishers thought up books like this that they would consider stories unlike the ones in this book. Stories of average people who have made it. Let's face it, most book lovers are not millionaires and it would be nice to know something about people who are not rich and famous who have been successfull. This is the same old stuff."
4,The Power of Words,"This book shares the personal stories of different celebrities from different areas of endeavors and of different political persuasions. As such, the collection is a bit of a mishmash - some thoughtful and meaningful stories; some rants and riffs of self-centered yammering that should have been edited - heavily. Also, the factchecking was surprisingly sloppy in places.However, I took away a valuable lesson - the importance of our words, and how they radiate out into the world in ways we can't anticipate. For example - the simple words of a firefighter's grieving mother touched Rudy Giuliani and guided him and inspired him two weeks later on Sept. 11, 2001.Who knows how what we say may change someone's life? This isn't the greatest book I've ever read, but that ""lesson"" will stay with me for a long time."
5,Inspirational mentoring...,"We have all had mentors who have given us timely advice, which if we had followed would have provided us with THE RIGHT WORDS AT THE RIGHT TIME. This book should be compulsory reading for all high school students. The lessons learned from these inspirational narratives written by over 100 famous and not so famous personages tell of advice learned early in their life or career which made a difference. They are more important survival skills than most mandatory academic classes. Not only are they short, and inspirational, they have been proven by these ""friends"" of Marlo Thomas. They have lived the lessons and consider them important life skills. Ms. Thomas herself is an inspiration...from her earlier writings, her acting career and dedication to the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. This is a ""must read."""
1,Really not worth reading.,"I really did not enjoy reading this book (if you can even call what I did ""reading""). At its best, it contains a few good anecdotes, but some of the contributions (this book contains no original material by Marlo Thomas herself) that held out the most promise turned out to be quite disappointing. It's not even"
1,Oh Please! Give me a Break!,"I was really looking forward to this read but grossly disapointed. I hardly see any ""right words"", just a bunch of (excuse me) ""silly"" stories from mainly celelebrities. Oh Boy, I want to be just like them! I don't look up to celebrities in the least because most of them are only powerful/successful because the entertainment industry is so ""over paid"". Who cares what these people have to say about their success? Isn't it enough our hard earned dollars have made them so much richer than the average American?? Ms. Thomas, I would have rather read more about average Americans and their stories of courage, or wise elderly people who really know about""average"" America. We need a lot more advise than what these people want to say. Please just pass it on to your other celebrity friends."
1,Trite and Unmoving,"Most of the stories have a PR bent to them and when I was reading them I felt they had been edited to make everyone look good. This is an overly postive book that is unrealistic and does not work in the real world. For example, could the right words be harsh words with a negative tone that made the person act in a certain way? The answer is yes, but not one example exists in the book and this makes the book feel like a press release rather than a credible biography. Finally, the quality of the writing is not that great, so don't expect Charles Dickens here."
1,More Marketing and Hype Than Good Stories,"Well, after seeing Marlo on TV I bought this book and I am sorry I did. The book is in need of a good editor and the sloppy writing style made me reconsider my purchase. The publisher apparently thinks that by putting Marlo on the cover it is going to get people to buy the book. I have always liked Marlo Thomas, but a popular celebrity does not a good book make!"
1,Famous People Who Write Poorly,"What struck me most about the book was how badly written many of the stories are in this large volume. Ms. Thomas has been on every show in America promoting her book, but when I sat down and just read the book I was not impressed. There will be no literary prize here and this book is a sad commentary on how publishing houses have moved away from good writing and focused on good salesmenship."
1,Good Message but a shallow approach,"The overall message to this book is positive, but it is really a shallow volume. There are no deep thoughts here to contemplate, so don't worry about bringing your thinking cap to the material. The book would better serve as a large paperweight."
1,Drivel,"I was hoping for inspirational material but the bulk of this ""book"" is drivel with little if any redeeming value. The essays are written as if to appeal to the masses with no regard to intelligent readers."
5,"Oh, the power of words!",It's sometimes better to learn from the experiences of others. We can often avoid unnecessary pain by learning from other people's mistakes. This is great summer read. Other recommended summer books include In-Law Drama and A Guide to the Scriptures.
5,Excellent inspiration for all ages!,"It's amazing how powerful a phrase or piece of advice can be. When I was growing up, my favorite book was Free to Be You and Me, and now I'd have to say this one ranks right up there in my top 10. Thanks!"
2,Attractive but VERRYYYY Confusing,"The directions look ""simple"" enough, but it seems like all the holes are on the wrong side, all the pretty sides have holes, and the rough ""insides"" aren't set up to be insides...Confused? We were too. Pretty picture, not so pretty setup."
2,Not What the Title Implies,"I was disappointed in this book. I found the majority of material to be related to 9/11 or to wildland firefighting while the cover implies it covers all ranges of firefighting. The material included is good...it just spends very little time on structural firefighting and the men who do that job. What time it does dedicate to it is mostly in the form of re-hash of previous material; Report from Engine Co 82, Working etc. There are better books out there, unless you are interested in wildland firefighting. If you are, then this is one of the better books on the subject."
4,young powell,This is definitely an excelent piece of music. one star less because the label is not good. I tried two different CD and they both skip. the label probably does not use a good recording system. Be carefull and willing to return it.
2,Don't watch this,"My mom got this from the library and I watched it. There r some errors in the movie. The one I'm most ticked off by is the old lady saying (in her exact words) ""Tyrannosaurus Rex was the LARGEST meat eater that EVER LIVED!"" What the crap!? UHHHHHHHHHH old lady spinosaurus was in 1st (THAT WE KNOW ABOUT)Giganotosaurus in 2nd carcharodontosaurus in 3rd and I think Tyrannosaurus was in 4th.And those were the largest meat eating DINOSAURS, I've heard that a sea reptile was bigger than spino. But sea reptiles aren't dinos. And another mistake is that the toodon were walking flat footed. SO I would not get this."
3,Magic School Bus - The Busasaurus,the tape has a static sound to it. considering i paid about $7 dollars I don't think I am going to go through the trouble of returning it but I am not happy with the quality of the tape.sgy
1,Doesn't ship,I don't know if this is a good video or not. I ordered it in November and it was supposed to ship the beginning of January. Still no video!
5,A tiny booklet packed with information,"This is a tiny booklet (40 pages) in the Christian Living Series.Ralph Earle knows how to lay out essential information in a clear and organized way. This booklet describes the parts of the Bible and the contents of each and makes practical suggestions which are particularly helpful for those embarking on serious scripture study, or on reading the Bible at all, for the first time. For example, Earle recommends beginning in the New Testament with the book of Matthew, and suggests reading one chapter a day of that book.This booklet is very helpful. However, I do not think it is worth nearly the amount being asked by some ""used"" sellers. The information found in it is all available elsewhere. If this booklet is not in print, look for something that is, such as ""The Bible Book by Book"" ."
4,sprayer,"This is a good, well made sprayer. I use is in the yard to spray for fire ants and around my fruit trees to keep pests down. I have a bad back so I only put in about a gallon of spray mix at a time and the plastic construction of the sprayer helps keep the weight down. One warning is that you need to rinse the sprayer out with clear water and spray some clear water after every use or the sprayer will clog up from the spray mix left in the sprayer. This is true of all sprayers so this is not a gig, just a fact of life. I'm guilty of not doing the cleaning and have two clogged up sprayers in my shed to show for it."
3,Okay,The only problems are that it doesnt come with a shoulder strap and it gets heavy.It also seems like you have too pump it forever!
5,Another Great Royal Diary,This book is great. She was married at 13! My favorite part tells about Marie Antoinette in France and she thinks the French etiquette is sometimes too much. I agree. She teaches her husband lots of Austrian things he has never heard of. Overall this book deserves the best rating. I recommend this book for book worms and girls ages 10-14.
5,GREAT BOOK!,this book is wonderful with a 13 year old girls thoughts of life being the queen of france at age 14!
2,A Royal Disappointment,"Expecting a vivacious heroine such as Cleopatra or Queen Elizabeth whom I admired in previous Royal Diaries, Marie Antionette's adolescence lacked intelligence and adventure. Born Maria Antonia of Austria, Marie Antoinette is forced to wed Louis Auguste, eventually becoming Queen of France. Throughout this lengthy diary, Marie did little more than complain of trivial inconveniences such as how uncomfortable her elaborate hairdos were or the unpleasant appearance of her husband. A few select parts describing the luxuries of palace life were interesting, but in all ""Princess of Versailles"" was a royal bore."
2,My Favorite Series but my least favorite book in the series,Do not get me wrong. This is my ultimate favorite series in the world. But this one is -yawn- borrrrrrring! All she talks about is how nosy her mother is and how anxious she is to get married. The only reason I gave this a two star was because it's in my favorite series.-YAWN-
5,Great book but I would not like to be her!,This was a fantastic book it caught my eye on the first page but really I would not like to be her because she had a terrible end and a terrible husband.(her head was cut off pretty disgusting!)
2,Marie Antoinette,"This was an interesting book. The author is a good fictional author. However, having studied the topic of Marie Antoinette for several years, it kind of made me angry to read this book, because a lot of the book was not true information. For instance, Marie Antoinette has riding lessons at her home in Austria in this book. But actually, she did not ride at all until she came to France, and her mother did not approve of it at all. There were many other made up things, too.I thought that it was a good book for people who don't care whether the information in it is true or not. But if someone was actually studying Marie Antoinette, they should not use this book for refrence. I'm 14, and a book about what really happened to Marie Antoinette that I enjoyed was ""The Last Queen of France"". That is a great book for actual studying."
5,YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!,I REALLY LOVED THE DIARY OF MARIE ANTOINETTE. I NOW UNDERSTAND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION MORE. IN THIS BOOK MARIE TELLS OF THINGS SHE DREADS LIKE BECOMING THE DAUPHINE AND BEING MARRIED. I FEEL SORRY WHEN HER NIECE DIES AND WHEN SHE IS SURPRISED WITH HER HUSBAND. I THINK THAT ANY PERSON WILL ENJOY THIS BOOK.
4,Great,"For its level, I found this to be a very good book. Explored the life of Marie Antoinette in a fictional, yet historic manner.I learnt a lot about the etiquette (Thank goodness they do not exist now)of the times, and felt the royalty were really prisoners in a gold cage.Not knowing what was truly ""out there"", these protected individuals were ill equipped to rule, and made a grand mess of things, ultimately leading to their ruin.Sad, but history has taught us much!"
3,Princess of Versailles; Marie Antoinette,"When I originally read this book it was way back in middle school, for some reason I decided I should read it once more. I really enjoy this fictional diary even though Marie Antoinette didn't write it, the facts we're pretty similar to historial books I have read about her. I'll openly admit I have a bit of a Queen Marie obsession going on now. Is that weird? Probably. Anyway, this book is suppost to be a children's book but I'll probably like it my entire life."
1,Marie Antoinette ??,With a little more knowledge and understanding of the time and historical facts this book might be less a disaster.One example: how come Marie Antoinette had to study French when this was the common language at all European Courts.Frederick of Prussia hardly spoke any German.Even the Russian tsar spoke it fluently.The rest of the facts described are as implausible.
5,"Ritzy, a little ditzy Marie Antoinette","Now, I have had some bad experiences with the Royal Diaries series. So far I have only read the Lady Red bird one, which was quite difficult to read, which I still liked though, and the Zhizo one or whatever, you know, the African one, which proved to be to short and very boring. But this one was funny, interesting, and very educational. Marie Antionette an seem like an air-head sometimes, but she had that Scarlett O'hara feeling in her. Shes head-strong and determined to learn all her lessons. The thing I disliked was I did a little research on her and found that she was really a little brat who got everything she wanted. Her peronallity is deciving of what she was really like in history in this book."
4,the princess of princesses,"This was an amazing book. Marie Antonette was a beautiful young maiden who showed her worth to King Louis. This was a great historical story. She was the great queen of England. She was, sadly, forced into an arranged marriage. She then transformed Louis into a kind man. I like this novel because it had real life situations in it and how to get out of them. I would look up to M. A. if she was alive today. She is my historical hero. She is a great role model to all special people."
5,Psychadelic and gothic dreamyness prevails,"Combine some modern - looking sculpted metal stage props with neon sand, then add rich gothic singing, and you have Perceval.At first, I sat watching the movie thinking ""ok what did I get myself into?"" because the singing irked me at first. Then I got used to it, and it became a chief and quite ingenious form of communication between the narrator, the actors, and the audience. Knowing a little bit of French eases the rapidity of a foreign language versus flashy subtitles.The story fails to get boring at any point, and the film is upbeat and interesting from every angle you look at it.Perceval is a lovable film with romance, duty, and gothic mysticism interwoven throughout. There's a small bit of nudity, but nothing offensively portrayed in a hardcore fashion. It's not your typical independent French film!"
2,Not your typical Rohmer,This movie is extremely stylized and not at all like Rohmer's other films. I'm a big Rohmer fan and was really disappointed by it. It is spoken in the original (?) dialogue of the Perceval story and is filmed entirely on intentionally fake-looking sets. You'll only like this movie if if you're actually interested in seeing a theatrical version of Perceval.
2,Maybe It's Me,"I purchased this coffee to brew in my Keurig using a reusable pod. I'll sum it up by saying it's ""not good"". This was disappointing because I do nothing but brag about Blue Mountain Coffee to friends and associates. I'll stick with my Donut Shop in the Keurig and see if I can find a traditional pot for the Blue Mountain."
2,Jablum leaves me nonplused...,"When in Jamaica I drink JBM coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean. What I opened this morning was not what I had expected. To be clear, I was greatly dissapointed. I found bits of husk from the bean, which doesn't make coffee, and is considered filler. The flavor left something to be desired as well, it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid. I was hoping to leave a great review of this product, but honesty forbids it."
3,so so,I'm a big Juan Valdez colombian fan. This Jamaican stuff doesn't have the kick that I love from coffee. It's sorta flat. Especially for something I spent $75 for two lbs. Goin Back To Colombian (twang twang)
5,A Great Juvenile Novel Similar to Stand By Me,"This is one of the best Depression-Era stories involving a youth group that I have read or seen on Film. This book has FILM ME written all over it. It is a story of a group of young kids that hop railroad cars during the height of the Depression and learn the struggles of the real world as they battle hobos and truth, while they eventually recognize the need to be loved is a truth that cannot be defeated.It is available in most larger libraries, usually in good condition or better."
4,Great Bag,"I searched for a leather case for 7""DVD player & didn't know anything about Targus, but bought the bag to try it out. It fits my portable DVD & it's accessories to the tee. Plenty of storage. I would recommend this case to anyone that wants a leather bag. The price was even reasonable."
3,Caution American Bulldog sign,Was surprised sign is plastic dropped it first day and broke it.Other than that gets message across.
3,The Young Cary Grant,"I can't say I thought much of the movie, but it was a pleasure to watch the incomparable Cary Grant."
4,Okay,"A VERY old movie with a wonderful feel good theme. Cary Grant at his usual good acting and delightful looks and timing. It is from the 30s, and the quality shows. Glad I have it, but was a little misled by the advertaising."
4,Good early Cary Grant movie,The only reason I rated this 4 stars in stead of 5 was for the quality of the transfer. Hopefully somene in the future will restore this movie. It is a well done movie and enjoyable to watch even with the lousy quality of transfer. Cary Grant does a wonderful job.
4,"Great story, but mediocre recorded quality","Great Cary Grant movie with substance. However, the sound was not the best - not really scratchy, but not right. I turned my television sound up several notches and was able to hear the movie, but would have enjoyed it much more with quality sound."
5,One of the best movies of all time. If only more people would try the experiment.,"The story of a wealthy man who hates his life and feels empty is dared to spend a year as a normal citizen without taking any money from his fortune. He takes the dare but does not realize that he will change lives, bring hope, and learn to believe in himself. A short charming movie that I love!"
2,bad transfer makes it impossible to recommend,this is a really good movie. i love the classics but only when i can get a decent transfer on disc. i would have enjoyed this much more if the transfer had been significantly better. i bought this one solely on the reviews of others. i was convinced that the transfer was adequate and so i gambled and lost. i am usually not as particular as some about transfers but this one i just cannot recommend. wait for a major studio to acquire the right and release it which at this point in time isn't likely.
3,Poor story,I *love* Cary Grant and I didn't even finish this movie. I may at some time when I'm pretty bored but not before. It's too bad when they made these movies so quickly and didn't put enough production value in them.
3,Cary Grant is Amazing,"I purchased this movie because Cary Grant is my favorite actor and I am collecting all his movies, and this was the only movie he made in his native England, so that was a major selling point. Until a restored version of this movie is made available, I would only recommend it to hard-core Grant fans or classic movie buffs. I won't go over the plot, but it's a good movie and Grant is just fabulous. This was made in 1936, before he was a major superstar. He makes the movie and you can tell he was gonna be big. The reason I wouldn't recommend it to the casual fan is the movie was originally close to 90 min long, and this version is only 63 min. You can still follow the story, but just barely. It's quite obvious when scenes are cut, and I wanted to see them! Also, the quality of the print isn't great. Watchable, but not great. So, if you love Grant and can get a good price, buy this movie. I for one will be waiting and hoping for a restored version to buy."
2,Poor DVD of a poor film,"This is one of Cary Grant's least memorable films...which is why I'd never heard of it. Produced on a very low budget, the episodic story makes very little sense, and the behavior of the characters strains credibility. Grant has no chemistry with his leading lady, so there's no reason to care if they end up together. It's all made even worse by a simply terrible DVD, apparently made from a mediocre 16mm print, with splices and scratches and very poor sound. There's no reason to have this DVD in your collection -- if you feel compelled to see it, rent it. Note that there are used copies available for less than $1, so that should tell you something about the quality of this one."
5,its great!!!!,"if you like the rentals, weezer, saosin, veruca salt, and breeders then you should probably check out this album. It has a touch of old school garage punk and a touch of todays emo screamo, to me a pretty cool blend. Hope you like - I did!"
3,Grad B,The buying and shipping process was a breeze. The toy did have minor bumps and bruise on the box but over all it was ok
1,"not ""all that""","no idea why someone should want to pay 196.84 for one of these. it doesn't contain the mythical ""lead to gold"" conversion process, does it?"
5,Purchase of Jeep TV,"I have not had the opportunity to use the product yet, other then a test. It seems to be operating correctly. It was an excellent value."
2,not happy with this seat,"we bought this car seat for our daughter but was dissapointed with the product on the whole. firstly, installation took a long time and secondly her head drooped forward or to the sides when she slept in it which was uncomfortable to watch. after a couple of days of use, we tried to return the seat to the vendor who refused to take it back because they said we had used it. we have now bought a britax and are happy with it and the eddie bauer is back in the box while we wonder what to do with it."
1,Doesn't Fit All Car Latch Systems & Button Locks In Cold,We had the worst experience ever with this seat! It did not work with the latch system in my two year old Subaru so we had to use the seat belt technique. The latch to push to loosen the seat belt in the chair was in a position that was difficult to reach and pinched my thumb several times. The belt tightened by pulling down...which was next to impossible as there was no room to pull down when it was installed in the car. The baby got stuck three times as the red release button would not release when pushed (in cold weather)...meaning we had to carefully drag him out from under the belt. We came very close to cutting the belt on two occasions! We finally gave up and returned to the item to Babies R Us...this took over an hour as they couldn't find the item number even with my receipt and we ended up losing our shipping cost and $10 coupon even though the product was clearly defective. We purchased a Britax instead and it is awesome :)
2,Too Big for alot of cars,This seat is so tall ...that if you dont have a big back seat in reverse mode it's obnoxious. It went to the top of the headrest of the front seat in our SUV. Our son was in this seat at 6months and the seat was not reclined enough for him and he just beginning to sit up and have to support his head ...and it would always roll completely forward. We returned this seat and went with the Evenflo DLX and absolutely love it.
3,Pretty good seat,"My parents bought this seat for our toddler to use when we visit. We also have a Britax Roundabout, which I love. Obviously this car seat is cheaper than the Roundabout, and my daughter seems to like it just fine. My major complaint is that the lap buckle is really hard to fasten, and I always seem to pinch either clothes or my daughter when buckling her in. The Roundabout solves this problem with protective padding behind the buckle, which is a great idea. The small buckles on the Eddie Bauer are also hard to fish out of the seat once the child is in it. These aren't MAJOR issues but they are annoying, especially when you are trying to restrain a squirming child! The Roundabout caters to all of these concerns and is therefore more comfortable, and isn't THAT much more expensive. I would have preferred another Britax but this seat is an acceptable alternative."
2,what a piece of crap!!,"I spent hours trying to figure out how to take the fabric cover off and ended up having to use a screw driver to pop the plastic caps that hold the fabric on the plastic frame!! It was a big hassle to take the infant headrest off and extremely difficult to remove the base from the main chair! You had to almost take a hammer to the metal pole and pull it out...it was soooo hard. My husband couldnt even do it! I guarantee if you are a clean person who likes to wash your carseat cover more than once a month...you will take this seat back, just like i did! I honestly think this seat is nice but it is next to impossible to take the cover off and wash it, unless you want to get out your ""tools"" to do it for an hour!If you are the type of person who doesnt wash the cover very much and wouldnt mine the extra muscle and work to do it, this seat is perfect."
1,Looks Good - Thats about it!,"The car seat looks very nice and seems to be comfortable...however...We own a Dodge Durango and the car seat is WAY to big to be strapped in right for the rear facing feature. The vehicle is VERY spacious and I did not think that this would be a problem. After getting so frustrated with trying to put it in we gave up and decided to return it AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! Also, it is hard to remove the infant head rest piece. I was very unhappy with this car seat, especially after paying as much as I did for it!"
5,Great Seat!,"We purchased this seat for our second car and it fits perfectly in our SUV (Chevy Trailblazer LTZ). Installing the seat was not difficult at all. We did remove the base to install the seat. To leval the seat we used those aqua noodle. We purchaed it in Toys R Us and we cut it in pieces. I like the fact that it sits high that way my son can look out the window, which he loves doing!"
4,"Susan, Lancaster Ohio","I bought this car seat for my daughter when she out grew her infant seat. She is 3 years old now and we are still using it. One draw back is that it is difficult to remove the seat cover, after I got it off and washed it it took me 45min to put the cover back on. I agree with another review that it does sit a little high, but ALL car seats do. My son was born 10 weeks premature, after he turned a year this past June our pediatrician recommended the Britax Marathon car seat. It's a great seat but very expensive and sits much higher than the Eddie Bauer. I was recently in a car accident and am going to replace both car seats with this one. Both of my kids seem to like it and it's very easy to adjust the straps. GOOD LUCK"
2,DON'T BUY,"Okay, I have had this car seat for two years and as gross as this sounds, the padding has only been washed once due to the fact that it is nearly impossible to get it apart and back together again properly. Once my husband and I did it once, we swore that we would rather buy another one than try to wash it again. I don't know why any manufacturer of car seats would make it this difficult to wash the padding on a carseat knowing that spills and messes are ineivitable with children. I kid you not, it takes a ton of finesse and a tool box to get this thing apart. I am pregnant with my second child and I refuse to get an eddie bauer product again. My husband and I are pretty easy going when it comes to products but this is rediculous. Probably the worst thing I have ever bought for my son. I have never written a review, but I felt compelled to tell people how bad this car seat is. Unless you like four hour projects to get this thing apart, washed, and back together don't buy this item!"
1,Compendium of Slide Projector Chapters,"Something of a disappointment. There is almost nothing of a truly technical nature. A lot of chalk board drawings but nothing you can feed to a computer to test any ideas. It would have been worth the price if it had included a few real world models, perhaps implemented as spreadsheets. Otherwise, it's just a b-r-o-a-d overview."
1,Gross misrepresentation,"This book is not by Robert L. Trippi. There may be no Robert L. Trippi, but there is a Robert R. Trippi, and he did not write this book. The book in fact is by one Dimitris N. Chorafas. The book is listed as being published by Macmillan. The actual publishing house is Irwin Professional Press. The book, when it arrives, does not have the advertised 400 pages, but rather 374. The index ends abruptly at that point with Dawkins. It is impossible to say what is going on here, but it is not good. The book itself, as I glanced through it, appears to be insultingly simple-minded and probably misguided. By all means save your time, your money, and your anger."
5,You want to be the Damn Kid,"Honestly, if you haven't bought this book then you are missing out on one of the funniest things that the WWW has ever had gracing it's user interface.This book is a collection of comic strips that Owen Dunn has produced as part of his web commic conveniently located at http://www.youdamnkid.com/ as part of the Keenspot network. It is a fairly quick read - I managed to get through the whole book in a little under 30 minutes, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in punch.It may not save your soul, but it will give it a great big laugh."
5,Supervision book,The book was just as I thought it would be. The place I purchased it from did a quick job sending it and it was in good condition upon arrival.
4,More sibling character development than most...,"This time, Savannah Reid is in the middle of a beauty pageant in Sour Grapes. Savannah's been asked by a friend to provide security for a teen beauty pageant at a posh winery. She takes the job, thinking this will be some of the easiest money she's made in awhile. But one of her sisters shows up nearly unannounced to compete, and one of the contestants turns up missing (and is later found dead). Savannah now has to figure out if the death was a murder or a suicide, while trying to also keep her sister safe if there's foul play going on...Pretty good plot line with the usual number of twists and turns along the way. Of all the Savannah Reid novels I've read to date, this one probably has more character development of a sibling than any other. The story also touches on accepting oneself without trying to fit into society's mold, when Savannah finds out her sister is taking laxatives to maintain a already low weight.Still enjoying the series..."
1,Do not buy it!!!!!!!!!!,"I am sorry to say this was boring. I have never been to Hawaii, but I know that it is beautiful. In this video all you see is a brown scrub path and the back of a couple walking. If anyone wants my video I will send it to them for postage alone unless I return it."
3,Video Strides Hawaii,Running on a treadmill can be Boring. I bought Video Strides Hawaii in the hope that it had a realism to it. I must admit this video is my favorite. It's not great but the other videos are worse. It stays on the trail or path it doesn't do any sight seeing along the way like other walking/running videos do. I would grade this a B- .
4,"As ""live"" as ""live"" can get - Eclectic Blues from Belgium","Belgium's strongest live-act has finally released a live-recording and it sounds great ! From their first encouters in jumpblues to their exotic latin fonky adventures, watch out ! Soon you might get hooked to these four passionate musicians too."
1,Ali,Will Smith's performance was excellent. But I do regret wasting my money on a movie about a man who refuse to serve his country because of his religious beliefs. Especially at this time with the events of the past months. I find it ironic that he refused to enlist because of his beliefs but yet in his personal life he seemed to live it as he saw fit. Being a member in today's military forces I truely regret every seeing this movie and hope that others will not make the same mistake.
3,Ali nothing special,"Going into ""Ali"", a Micheal Mann film, I thought this was going to be an absolutely great movie. As the credits began to roll however, I was a little dissapointed. The movie is very sluggish and seems to be forever explaining itself. It is also not what most people I have talked to expected. There isn't enough fighting, and I'm sorry but that's what was selling the movie from the beginning...Will Smith in the ring. I probably wouldn't recommend this movie to many, but you may enjoy it."
3,Great....If You Happen To Like Will Smith,"I didn't purchase this film and I really don't plan to since I really didn't like it that much when I rented it. I got confused for a second and thought I'd rented a Will Smith[movie]...I thought that this movie was at least watchable especially during the fight scenes. The choregraphy was on the money. Smith even talked trash like the original and the greatest Ali...He would've been Ali had he been a boxer and had a big mouth but Ali was more than that, he refused to go to Vietnam, he stood against what society during his hayday thought he should've been complacent with like racism and to some degree class discrimination... I think if you don't like Smith, you won't really like this movie. You ought to check out some of the movies staring the real Ali! You get to see the Man in action albeit black exploitation but still a lot better than Smith's Ali!"
2,Poor editing destroy it,"This films failure is at large due to poor editing. Then opening sequence is played out over about 10-minutes using the same song played live, the opening boxing match that follows is slow, boring and long (where is the editing??) I felt like the film was wasting my time and I had almost already gone to sleep. I let it play out about fifteen minutes and then noticed the full running time of the movie (where is the editing). Didn't finish it so my two star rating is only for the first thirty minutes or so of the film. I wouldn't bother."
1,Wait for the DVD/Video,"Actually, I'd give it 1.5 stars. I have been an Ali fan my entire life. I can remember sitting at the television, mesmerized by Ali's charisma, and superb boxing as a child with my father. I have read all I can about Ali, and seen every video available. This movie did not do his life justice. Ali was full of energy and charisma. This movie was not. It was long and drawn out, full of ""artsy"" camera shots and cinematography with little of the energy that Ali radiated through out his career. In a movie of this length, they could have covered more of his life, instead they let the ""creative talents"" of the director and producers take center stage, while Ali himself would have never let anyone take center stage over himself. If you're a diehard Ali fan, (whatever you do, don't take your wife, if you go to the theatre, she'll hate it), you'll want to get the video/ dvd, so you can pause it and fast forward."
3,i only looked at this because i wanted to see Jamie Foxx!,"will smith did a good job in this movie but i really think the reason why he did not get the academy award was probally because there have been movies made on Muhummed Ali already, it just was not unique enough. but i really looked at this movie because i wanted to see My Jamie Foxx. He did a really good job on this film too. actually both Jamie and Will did an excellent job in their characters. i noticed the both of them had to get beefed up for this one. i would love to see them in a remake of a real good movie, like ""Some Like it Hot"" or ""The Fortune Cookie"" or maybe an urban flavor version of ""The Odd Couple""."
2,Ali Lacks the Punch,"I went to see Ali with great anticipation based on the trailers and behind the scenes television spots. I am almost fifty years old and grew up following Ali's amazing career and life.I'm not sure what Michael Mann was attempting to capture, but I feel he missed in all areas. The story doesn't really go anywhere. It just sort of rambles. It spends far too much time on musical montages. One scene of Ali doing road work in Africa just seems to go on and on and on.The casting is a real plus. Will Smith captures Ali better than anyone (short of Ali himself). Jon Voigt almost steals the picture with a remarkable performance as Howard Cosell. Jamie Foxx and Mario Van Peebles round out an excellent cast. Unfortunately their not given a very good story to work with.I recommend you rent ""When We Were Kings"". A documentary about the real ""Rumble in the Jungle"" starring the actual participants.""Ali"", I'm afraid is a waste of time."
2,Will Smith Ain't Ali,"The life of Muhammed Ali could have made a great film. But this attempt comes up way short for two main reasons: 1) Instead of portraying Ali in a balanced way, it attempts glorification of someone who had more than his fair share of human failings. 2) Will Smith is seriously miscast. In the film, he doesn't look like, talk like, or act Ali. Will Smith might be good in the role of a light-weight boxer, but it was a big mistake to think he could portray a heavy-weight."
2,Rich Little would have done just as good!,"One of the most charismatic people of the last 30 years finally gets a movie about his life; what a shame ""The Fresh Prince"" had to portray this hero. The movie falls short to all expectations and for some reason Smith gets acclaim.Ali's life was something else. His life outside the ring rivaled his battles in the ring. The premise of the movie looks good on paper, but many aspects were left out. His encounters with Joe Frazier in and out the ring was for some reason excluded from the movie. Ali's rival WAS Joe Frazier.Will Smith was decent in his imitation of Ali. He had the voice down (so does Billy Crystal), but all that weight gaining wasn't enough. His only love scene was with his real-life wife, this is not groundbreaking acting! Smith was good in the boxing scenes, which were better than any boxing-related movie to date.All in all, very disappointing. Maybe there will be a sequel, if there's one for Men in Black, I can easily see one for this flick."
2,Will Smith Flops,"I went to the movie theatres expecting this great movie, because that is what Will Smith usually gives us. The first hour and a half was very choppy and didn't have any sort of flow. The last hour and a half made some sort of sense. I would recommend to rent this at home and not waste your 7 bucks. Ali turned out to be a very long-winded, not-exciting movie and I almost felt like walking out."
3,Disappointed - I expected better.,"I believe that Will Smith is one of the most charismatic actors working today and looked forward to seeing him as Ali. Unfortunately, no actor can yet hold up to the original. Get the documentaries such as ""When We Were Kings"" instead of this film. Ali is still a larger than life human being who hasn't yet been captured in a fictional portrayal.This is a well-made film, but lacks energy and drama."
3,Ali,Mohammed Ali is the greatest boxer of all time! His come-back in Zaire I watched on Maui with some friends after returning from Thailand.I'll never forget those times...
3,They can't touch the real thing!,"The problem with doing bios of contemporary figures, is that they are still here for comparison. After just watching the press conference scene w Ali and Don King, I had to write this review. Often, the re-enactment in bios exaggerates real life. But in this case, the actors (and I like and respect both of them) couldn't even come close to the energy and personality of the real Ali and Don King. Pathetic. Just watchWhen We Were Kingsto see the real deal."
5,WOW!,Used with my High School Students for Black History month with lots of support materials and activities and real footage from fights and times.They loved it. I loved it. They actually clapped and cheered when we finished the movie.There is a lot to talk about and discuss.Also celebrated Ali's 70th Birthday.Good Luck!
2,over hyped,"Thought it was going to be an epic, turned out to be just plain pathetic. This movie lacked so much. Who cares that will smith bulk up for the role and looked a little like ali. I wanted to know more about his life. They could have shown less about the fights and more about the man...... poorly done, big budget flop, thats why it fell of the radar at the movie theaters."
3,Where's the rest of the story?,"Ali is basically an incomplete film. If you want to consider it a time capsule of how Ali reached the pinnacle of his greatness, then you would be correct.However, there was much left to be told in the story. I think I would have wanted to see this film capture all of Ali's good and bad moments. A lot of build-up but a little anti-climactic given how much of his story was omitted."
4,See this film,"Ali may not be ""the greatest"" film you'll ever see but it makes a respectful showing as it tells the life of a living legend. I was very young when Ali was in his prime but stillI remember the respect he gained from the people in my community. Ali, as played (very well) by Will Smith is ashowman, a philospher, a poet and a lover. Smith was perfectlycast here. Who else could mimic his charisma? Jon Voight'sis superb as Howard Cosell. His and Smith's performance isworth the price of rental."
2,don't bother,"Will Smith did well. His portrayal of Ali is all this film had to lean on, the storyline was weak and drawn. I'd suggest renting it once, not buying it."
3,great acting...but where is this film going with its point?,"that is my big critique of Ali. it has some wonderful acting in it and the boxing scenes are totally cool. i hadnt really paid attention to Muhammed Ali's life before seeing this film, so i always questioned why everybody thought he was the best. once seeing this film, i could see why. but still, i had the feeling like the movie just simply picked up from Ali's life in 1964 and ending in 1976--or whenever that rumble in the jungle was--without really saying much of anything plot-wise."
1,Lets change our name because we're a sissy...,"this guy doesnt deserve to have his name printed on the cover of a movie. Between his racist, black panther life and his draft dodging alter ego they should have burned him at the stake years ago......stupid peanut head."
2,Why?,"While the film did a positive thing by refocusing the public's attention onto a key persona of the World's Stage, I did not approve of this movie. And the reason why is that this theatrical tragedy portrayed the real Ali who possessed a for-the-most-part soft-spoken and somewhat shy demeanor and was adoreed by the ladies on a sex symbol scale with a loud-mouthed, vainglorious person who reminded me of some of the negro punks who I attended an integrated school with. So why ruin Ali's reputation over the making of this piece of trash in return for a quick buck. Missed being treacherous on a Judas scale by a fine hair. Couldn't even mention that Muhammad was so good-hearted, how could anyone ask him to kill anybody! So F^^K the movie, S^^K Me Director, & DUCK Me Actor"
3,Ali Is A Worth While Flick,"Ali is a movie you would want to see only once . It is a great movie but it seems very long . I reccomed you wait for videofor Ali . Ali stars Will Smith , Jamie Foxx , Ron Silver , Jon Voight , Mykelti Williamson , Jeffery Wright , Mario Van Peeblesand Jada Pinkett Smith."
2,Ali,"Rather disappointing film about the life and times of the famous boxer. The name Cassius Clay (his real name) is never brought about. Also a downer was that it seemed to center more on Malcom X later in the movie than Clay himself. It was funny seeing a young Don King represented but instead of getting to know the man, the viewer is bandied about with constant themes of racism, the draft and other pieces of the 1960s. I know that is a part of his life but personally I really did not enjoy it, instead of feeling like I was viewing his life, I was viewing the life around him. Will Smith is cast as Ali but honestly, they portray the man as if he could only talk when ranting about how great he was with ""float like a butterfly/sting like a bee"" and ""I am the greatest"" being punched at me over and over again. I must say again, this film is more about the life and times that happened around Ali than about his personal life or boxing legacy."
5,I think this movie was the greatest,"Personaly i think this movie was great. The acting was wonderful. I think Will Smith was perfect for the part, i thought he captured Ali's essence and charm."
2,Just too long!,"I really did enjoy this movie and it's almost a sure thing that you will too. Seeing a great team of Will Smith and John Voight play the part of a great team in Muhammad Ali and Howard Cossel is extremely entertaining. When those two interact are great parts of the film, as are the boxing sequences. However Michael Mann did the same thing in this movie that he did to The Insider in 99'. He made it about 15-25 minutes too long! I mean there are parts in the theatre where i just couldn't help but say shouldn't this be over. Some scenes are just dragged out too long. There is a specific one where ali (smith) is running through a town in africa and all these people are chanting his name. Think Rocky but make it fives times longer. It is touching but just over done, as are several other parts of the movie. It is a good film but it just could have been better and should have been an oscar contender. You might sit through it once but it's not worth a second watch."
1,Ali,"I felt really bad for Will Smith,this woman was just aweful.It jumped aroud no real direction.I thought that is would start from his childhood up.Was more about politics etc.Will Smith was the only good thing in the movie he did the best he could with this BAD movie.Sorry Will,but you where buff!"
1,Dont waste your time,"I watched this on PPV last nite and spent much of the movie with the volume off. Too much bad music, no character development, Wil was wasted and the movie skipped the only thing that makes Ali an interesting person: his battle with Parkinson's and his advocacy for research. I dont even recommend renting it - wait till it's free on TV if you have some time to waste."
1,What a waste!!,"This movie was at best a 90 minute flick but with all long drawn out boring ""Music video"" type parts, it stretched out to over 2 1/2 hours. Ali, in my opinion, is an interesting character, but the way this [movie] was put together was not worth the ticket price or even a rental price. If you have 2.5 hours to kill, and have seen everything else,get 3 other people to chip in a dollar each and rent it......... just keep the ffwd button close at hand."
5,EXCELLENCE,This is was GREAT movie! As a matter of fact it was the best movie I've seen in a while. I love the way the movie gives a more personal view of Malcolm X. I feel that Will Smith did a wonderful job. I'm ready for this movie to come out on vhs so I can own it!!!!!!!
5,Will is great,"Will Smith is absolutely wonderful as Ali, his best film to date.A must see for all Smith's fans as well as for history buffs and boxing fans."
3,Bee sting no so bad,"Kudos for the attention to detail and the hard work Will Smith put into it, but the story just isn't that exciting. It's hard to get excited about a self inflated, draft dodger, no matter how good a fighter he was."
5,THE CHAMP IS HERE!!,Wil Smith delivered a knockout performance of The Greatest in Michael Mann's production. I had a chance to see this movie again in my collection. Jamie Foxx also did a super job in the movie. Anyone who followed the career of Muhammad Ali won't be disappointed in this movie portrayal!
2,Did you see when we were kings?,"Ok Ali was one of the greatest of all times and Will smith is a good actor. Excuse me but,I would like to remind that religous freak that this is a movie review, not an open forum for you to preach to other people how rightous your beliefs are. It's a movie about sports don't take it so seriously. The problem is Ali is the exact same movie as when we were king's. The footage is similar the plot line is similar and instead of will smith it's real life footage of the champ himself. If you haven't seen the documentary when we were kings, youre missing out. It actually one the oscar in 97 for best documentary and it is a far wuperior film than ali. Thanks"
2,WHERE ARE THE SPECAIL FEATURES,"I SAW THIS MOVIE AT THE THEATERS AND I LOVED IT ALOT. I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RELEASE OF THE DVD, BUT I'M A BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT THE ALI DVD HAS NO SPECAIL FEATURES AND I DON'T THINK I WILL PURCHASE THE DVD FOR THAT VERY REASON. THE SPECAIL FEATURES ARE WHY I BOUGHT A DVD PLAYER IN THE FIRST PLACE."
3,Disappointing as a biopic,"This movie, directed by Michael Mann, is all surfaces. I looked forward to learning something about Mohammed Ali, about whom I knew nothing, so it was disappointing to find this film to be more like a music video (or string of them) than a biopic.There's nothing wrong with the performances. Will Smith is fine; sometimes his resemblance to Ali is almost creepy. But, beyond depth, the movie lacks connective tissue. It's one damn thing after another. You don't feel a why behind anything. Ali becomes a fighter. Why? He converts to Islam. Why? Etc.So I don't especially recommend it. But if you have the remotest interest in Ali, do see When We Were Kings; this is a terrific documentary about the Ali/Foreman fight in Zaire."
1,failed my expectations,this was not good at all. just a dumb excuse for a docudrama. its so slow even i could write it better. its really the worst movie ever.
3,"Good Performance By Smith, Story A Little Incomplete","Ali is a decent bio of Mohammad Ali's boxing career. Will Smith certainly elevates the performance of the film. Its amusing to listen to Will imitate Ali as he talks trash before his big fights and to Howard Cossel. Also the actor who portrays Howard Cossel does him good justice.However, the story is a bit incomplete. The story cuts right to the first Sonny Liston fight with little introduction on Ali's growing up period. Than there is the focus on his dodging the draft and his spiritual role as a Muslim. This is given decent emphasis. Finally some coverage of his fights with Frazier, Quarry, and Foreman. Somehow it would have been nice of the movie included some mention of the second and third fights with Frazier and even Ali past his prime.Nonetheless, the fight scenes are exciting and even in its limtied focus, the movie is good if not spectacular."
2,disappointing,could have been much better if scorcese had directed it. check out raging bull a much better boxing bio from martin scorcese. i expected a lot more from ali. it dosent show enough of his amazing boxing career and as for his life outside the ring it could do a better job there to. except for his stand against the us government the film is very sketchy and blurry. will smith is not to convincing as ali. there are some good performances though. jamie fox is excellent as bundini brown. jon voight is very good as howard cossel. casting real life pro fighter and former world champion james toney as joe frazier was a smart move but hes underused in the film. the fight scenes especially ali vs foreman are well done. in short its ok but could have been much better
2,Ali is not a movie character,"Last December this movie was a big disappointment both for the critics than the box office: I think it was unavoidable since Ali is a character too big and multifaceted to be reduced to a movie. Will Smith performance is impressive and Michael Mann's techinque filming the boxing matches works well because it gives you the sensation of being on the ring: maybe this movie could appeal to someone who hasn't read books about Ali, nor seen documentaries, however in such a case I suggest you read Remnick's ""King of the world"" and watch Gast's ""When we were Kings"".This DVD edition is a barebone one: the video is honest, no state of the art here; the 5.1 DD audio track is good but no much surround effects here."
4,Ambitious project,"Mohammed Ali is bigger than life and portraying him in a movie is a daunting task. Will Smith probably comes as close to looking, sounding and acting like Ali as a person could, but there is always a sense that the movie falls a little short of catching the essence of the man. Events in Ali's life unfold in the movie, but there is never much depth of explanation about why things happened as they did. John Voight is superb as Howard Coselle and the movie paints a close relationship between Cosell and Ali which is belied by the verbal barbs they always shot at each other on tv. There are so many important events in Ali's life that if must have been a nightmare deciding what to include. Although it has a 2 1/2 hour running time, the movie seems to end rather abruptly. Despite its flaws, Ali is an entertaining film and does hold the viewer's attention."
4,Good Quality,"I've purchased this movie for a gift and I tested it before. Everything was fine with it. besides that, is not one of my favorites to be honest :)"
1,Junk,We ordered this for our three year old and it seemed to work well until the ball actually hits the rim and then the rim falls down. Total junk.
3,A Slight Step Up From Toddler Hoop,"My two year old loves basketball, so we put this hoop on his birthday wish list after reading the good reviews. He also has the Little Tikes hoop, which we've been very happy with. We just wanted a hoop that would be a little bigger and grow with him. This hoop goes somewhat higher, but it is also not as stable (even when filled with water to weight the base). In addition, it also uses the smaller-sized toddler basketball and nothing in-between. It looks a little more ""grown-up"" with the team logos on the backboard, but that's about all. Not as sturdy, no bigger ball, just a little higher than the toddler hoop. A little disappointing."
3,Not that great,"This hoop broke after a few months. The hoop kept falling down and needed to be snapped into place constantly. Eventually, we had to tape it to the board. My boys hardly played with it."
5,Best Hoop for a young child,"Forget the plastic non-adjustable toy hoops. This is the one to get. It looks and feels like the real thing. It's lowest height is perfect for my 2 and 1/2 year old, and grows on from there. It actually extends in a few inch increments and gets pretty high for a kid. The 5-inch ball that comes with it is great for tossing but not for bouncing as it's bounce is not predictable, so for more advanced kids you'll want a Jr. basketball, which will fit through the hoop but will be a little tight. It can still be done though.Conclusion: If you are thinking about getting a ""real standard size"" adjustable hoop, then get that over this one beacause of the hoop diameter limitation. But, if you are shopping for a very young child one, this one is the best one, price and all considered."
3,Basketball system is okay,"We got this for our three year old grandchild and he loves it. The ball is perfect for his hands and he plays with it a lot.It was easy to assemble, but is not as sturdy as it could be. We'll have to see how it last through the tosses and the weather."
3,Great product but not sturdy,"I love this product(amazon also had the most competitive price), however after just a couple of months of use, this product hasn't sustained well. My son is only 3 yrs old and has not used this product in unintended fashion. First the screws came off and I had to make a trip to home dept to buy more sturdy metal screws. Then the basket keeps coming off because the snaps that go into the back board came loose. Untimately it broke off. Does anyone know if there's a replacement part I can order for this? At this point my son cannot play with this."
5,It's about time!,"I first discovered Kenneth Anger films while watching Invocation of my demon brother on the back of a screen while a band was playing at a club. After finding out who directed the film I was able to look up some of Anger's films on YouTube.Fireworks - Really interesting how the film opens with Kenneth awaking from a dream while holding some kind of Idol statue. It then turns into a really cool scene of him getting torn apart and then awaking from a dream from within a dream. There are a lot of cool things to look for such at the statue of the hand in the begging and how it looks at the end of the film. You can see where this film would help mold upcoming underground art.Puce Moment- This short film really capture's desire, an in my opinion the comfort in alienation.Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome- This is my favorite film off of the collection. This film really takes you on a journey into a beautiful occult fantasy, it's almost like a bosh painting come to life."
2,"Ed talks, but doesn't sing","I guess the title of this CD really says it all, but I still hoped the CD would include some music...no luck. If you want to hear Ed Vedder share some of his usual wisdom about the world (and can stand listening to everything he says being translated into german) this is for you."
3,"Great Clock, Bad Outdoor Temp Sensor","The atomic clock feature and indoor humidity/temp features are great, but the outdoor temp sensor only lasted a year. Also, temp sensor placement is important to its accuracy. Even if it placed in an optimal position deviation on very hot/cold days is pretty significant."
1,Never accurate; now useless,"I've had this clock for a little over a year. Its temperature and humidity displays were never accurate. Its redeeming feature was its large time display I could read without glasses. Now, the clock will no longer set itself. The large display is still distinct, but the necessity to reset the clock manually reduces its value to that of a normal clock. I only use atomic clocks, so this is of no value to me now."
1,La CrosseWS-8349U,"I would give this a lower rate than one star but I can't. In less than 1 year the out door sensor went out, and a couple of month after that the atomic clock stopped updating, so all that is left is a manuel set clock with date and time and indoor weather."
3,Like it,"We like the clock, but when the 7 is displayed, the bottom of the number is not visible. We don't have trouble reading it, but it would be nice if this wasn't an issue."
2,Nice clock but quality seems to be lacking,"After only approximately 2 weeks, some of the LCD segments are no longer working for the humidity and the indoor temperature display. I did contact the manufacturer who did provide an RMA for returning the product for testing. It did take LaCrosse approximately 1 week to respond to my inquiry. I also sent an e-mail to Unbeatable Sales on 2/12 regarding the issue and they have yet to respond. Other than the LCD failure, it is a nice clock with lots of features."
2,Missing Basic Features,"I just received this clock. It permits the language for the display to be changed from English to Spanish or French. But it does not permit the display to change from Fahrenheit to Centrigrade, nor does it permit the display to be changed from the 12-hour AM/PM format to the 24-hour international/military format. Seems like some pretty basic features, that would cost almost NOTHING to add. I have other atomic digital clocks, cheaper than this one, that permit these display changes. So it seems that whoever designed this was asleep at the wheel. Almost the entire world uses Centrigrade except the US, and most use the 24hr time format. This is such an American-made product from this perspective. So international buyers AVOID this model......."

4,Good but better live,"A surprisingly well done album with a good wide variety of moods. Good songs, include ""Can't Help Wondering Why"" and ""Tired of Pretending"". If you can, see Blue Rodeo live or get one of their live albums (Just like a Vacation)"
5,Just plain good.,"I just want to start off by saying that this is a real good cd. With all of the crap out there nowadays, it is really refreshing that these boys, together over twenty years, are still able to create songs that are both fresh and exciting yet carry just a hint of yesteryears glory.Do not compare this cd with their past works, I just don't find that to be productive. Take it for what it is. Part pop, country rock with a little injection of Greg's growl, which I love. I like the less polished and pretty feel of this one.Though I enjoy the whole cd and find it blends very well, the 3 songs I find myself repeating most are Rena, Tired of Pretending and Don't Get Angry. Tired of Pretending being my favorite. Pulled at my heart and kicked me in the stomach the first time I heard it.So whether you are a big BR fan or have never heard of them before (impossible), I suggest picking this one up instead of that JET or GOOD CHARLOTTE cd in your other hand."
5,excellent stuff!:),"1 of the Best Reggae Artists of all time,Eddy Grant.This Best of compilation,contains all his very well known hits,like: 1.I don't wanna dance 2.Gimme hope jo'anna 3.I can't get enough of you 4.Electric Avenue Etc,Etc,Etc...(Up to 16 songs). Review:Excellent piece of Material(Music),it's a must!:)"
2,5 Star Reviews snookered me :-(,"I was expecting a really good romantic suspense. In the very fist chapter, I knew I was in major trouble when the heroine, in her early thirties, gets tipsy and asks the handsome Senator she has just met her probing, journalistic questions, such as if a woman ""really does taste like tuna fish?""...naive, tipsy giggle treacle...*eyes roll* ... how weird is that? Was it supposed to be cute?? It just came off so jarringly stupid and adolescent, and painfully ill placed, I had a hard time getting past it. Didn't it strike other readers? Hello?!Either the author is editing her own work (hard to believe) and thus blind to whoppers that need the red pen, or she REALLY needs to get a MUCH better editor to help her transition from historicals.Maybe if I hadn't fallen for the 5 star reviews, and the entire first chapter set-up had been totally re-done, it might have been easier to enjoy and get lost in this book, instead of focusing on its weaknesses."
4,"Good start, but had characterization problems...","This is the first book I've read by this author, and it was worth the read, for the most part. The plot idea was good, and the pacing was fine, but the characterization had problems - mainly with dialogue. I would be racing along in the book and would often get thrown out of the story by the ""off"" dialogue by her main characters - it was often childish, or just unrealistic. I haven't read the other books in this series, but according to the reviews, the author may have overcome her dialogue problems. I'll try the next one and see for myself. :)"
4,Great chemistry between main characters,I love Pamela Clare's historic romance and decided to try this series since I don't like the paranormal. There was great chemistry and over all a pretty hot read. Looking forward to the next one!
3,"Fun, light read","Fun book, if you don't think about it too hard. Great way to pass the time, cute relationship between the two leads."
4,Good book!,I read Skin Deep first and a sample of Unlawful Contact before I read the first in the series. This book was good and the hero and heroine were okay but something seemed off. I did find the mystery very good and it kept me reading. I also liked the reality of Kara being a single parent and like all parents falls short at times. I guess some of the story was very realistic but other parts appeared unbelievable. This is a good first book to the series. Ms Clare is very good with words and very knowledgeable about journalism and reporting. The reviews were helpful in my selection of this book. I enjoyed the book enough to download book 2.
5,Pleasantly surprised!,"This was my first book by Pamela Clare and so I didn't know what to expect. I'm happy to say that I have now added another author on my auto buy list. The writing was excellent, the story flowed well and the romance was tender and heartwarming. I loved all the characters, especially Reece- he was so hot and his chemistry with Kara was truly intense! The secondary characters also added greatly to the story and I can't wait to read about Tess in her next book called Hard Evidence. The suspense, while predictable, kept me turning the pages. All in all, a great read and one you must give a chance to!"
5,Great adventure story and lots more,"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It is a combination adventure story, philosophical treatise, personal search for meaning in life, and a wonderful book about indigenous Tibetans. I think this is one of the few books that I have read that I will read again, because I know there is more I will get out of it. Ian Baker's many attempts to ""discover"" the hidden waterfalls on the Tsangpo river form the core of the book, but he is also searching for the truth behind many of the myths of local Tibetan Buddhist beliefs in the Tsangpo region. He leads expeditions with a colorful character list eccentric westerners, and has dealings with Buddhist lamas, local hunters, Chinese bureaucrats, and more. A great read!"
5,Searching for the Sacred,"There is something kind of unusual about searching for the sacred by wandering around in the rain through the brambled cliffs of the eastern Himalaya. In his search for a lost secret place - a Beyul in Tibetan philosophy - Scholar and Adventurer Ian Baker succeeds where many others have failed.Through his ten trips to the area does Baker find Shangri-La, a British myth likely inspired by the region? No. But for anyone who is spiritually moved by the Outdoors this book documents interestingly Tibetan perspectives and paradoxes as they apply to the geographic. Baker does wander through his subject, just as he wanders through the area - but in the end he reaches his goal, as to may you, just by reading this book."
1,Ego Trips: Rich American Kids Climb Around the Himalayas,"The author tries to couch this series of journeys in buddhist trappings, giving them a philosophical and spiritual underpinning, but they are really just X-game adventures.The whole book was about me, me, me, and all the cool stuff I did."
5,a fascinating story,Salome by Oscar Wilde with Illustrations by Aubrey BeardsleyThe Kindle edition of Salome contains Aubrey Beardsley illustrations. A brilliant tale of passion; a very quick and interesting read.
1,No Sugar -coating,"This band is a joke and if you think otherwise you MUST be def.This is Cheese rock in it's purest form.If there was a music god he would sentence this band to a lifetime of Dive bars and obscurity...I think that if this band wants to let the listeners know what they're in for they should remove the letters ""ST"" from their name and replace them with a ""D"" I've heard farts that sound better than this record...Do yourself a favor and take a pass."
5,Mike's Newest May Melt Your Stereo,"The latest from Hanoi Boy Mike Monroe may be his finest solo effort to date.This cd will take the paint off your walls. Opening with an incendiary cover of Eddie & the Hot Rods classic ""Do Anything You Wanna Do"", Mike sets the tone for an album that never falters. This scorching declaration of independence fits right in with the Monroe Mythos.Mike Monroe IS Rock'n'Roll, and this album is ample proof of his contribution to our music. His explosive rendering of Dead Boys standard ""What Love Is"" is worth the price of the cd on it's own. His plaintive vocal on final cut, ""Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye"" is proof positive of the man's versatility.This album is Punk Rock for here and now by one of the masters; it's an excellent companion piece to that great new one from Hanoi Rocks. Unreserved recommendation to those who like hard, passionate Rock'n'Roll."
4,Good rules for fighting that war you've always wanted...,"The rules are passable for a miniature game, but as a set of mass combat rules for AD&D, it works well. It was listed as a 2nd Ed. game, but it is seriously lacking in the area of magic: none of the spells from TOM are here, and very few from the PHB. There are resources available on the net to help, just search with the word BATTLESYSTEM. If you can find a copy, and you wish to dive into miniatures, this is a good start. TSR/WOTC has no plans to re-issue this game, but if they received letters from fans demanding it be brought back... Check the local game conventions for a game and try it. If TSR/WOTC refuses to re-print this classic, they may make it available on the web. Good luck."
3,My gaming buddies and I had a lot of fun with this game,"The 2nd Edition Battlesystem rules really bring back a lot of good memories. When I was in the Army, my buddies and I would stay up all night playing D&D and having imaginary battles on the floor of our room in the barracks. We couldn't afford miniatures so we would use posterboard cut-outs. It was a lot of fun. The only reason I only gave it three stars was because the War Machine mass combat rules that were part of the original Dungeons & Dragons game were much better."
1,Waste of money,"1950's Retro Candy Gift BoxI ordered this for my husband for Christmas 2008. The box was torn and banged up. There may have been $5.00 worth of candy in it and most of it was stuff I could have bought in any novelty shop-even cracker barrel. As a matter of fact, Cracker Barrel did have similar items in a basket for half the price. I wish I had saved my money. Then add on the shipping- it was VERY expensive!"
1,Waste of money,"I bought the 1950's candy crate for my daughter for her birthday. I paid $38.00 with shipping and handling. I don't know what I expected but I was stunned at how little we got. It was about $5.00 worth of candy (probably worth no more than $.50 total in the 1950's), .50 for all the waste of paper to stuff the box, and the rest of the cost was probably for nostalgia. I would never buy one again."
1,1950's Retro Candy Gift Box Purchase,Great idea.I was excited to give this as a gift. Very disappointed when it arrived.Expensive for what you actually get. I felt I needed to purchase an additional gift to go with it which made it even more expensive.I won't order this again.
2,"Nice assortment, but quality was poor.","The Retro Candy Gift Box was a nostalgic assortment of nostalgic candies. I bought it for a family member who enjoyed several of these candies during their childhood years. Unfortunately the candy freshness was poor. Most of the confections were shelf-stale. Old. Gums were rock-hard, such as the Bazooka individuals. Suckers had a soft outer layer. Too many items were obviously past their sell-by dates. The joke went around the table that ""maybe these candies *are* actually left over from the 50's!"". It was a trip down memory lane for the gift receiver, but a disappointing one at that. I would not buy this again."
2,Not Impressed,"I couldn't send this product back because I had to open it to take a look at the product. On first glance, I wasn't impressed at all. Perhaps I was expecting to be wow-ed and was disappointed instead. The candy was damaged. I am hoping no one else played around with this candy before I received it. The box it came in was cute with its little bow. I'm afraid to eat the candy because it looks like its been handled. It's not worth the money."
2,"Old candy, really old...","I thought it was weird that my sister had not contacted me with a ""thank you"" a month after this was sent. It turns out that they never included a gift card! Sooo, my sister did not know who sent the candy until I asked. She said the packaging was nice and the candy brought back many pleasant memories, except that most of the candy was stale & hard. She said she liked the ""crispy"" jelly beans, but had a hard time chewing the ""leather like"" bazooka bubble gum. Although definitely stale, she said she enjoyed the present and ate the candy anyway..."
4,Retro Candy a Hit,"Sent the box of candy to a client office as a thank you Christmas gift. Apparently there was no gift tag when the product arrived, so nobody knew who it was from. :-( Candy assortment was good and people enjoyed."
3,Not Such a Sweet Deal,"1. This was a gift order and I filled out the request for a card to be enclosed. It was delivered without any gift card or information where it came from.2. Not worth the cost.3. Received an email saying it couldn't be delivered to a PO Box. It didn't say that on the order form.Overall, not a good deal."
4,Gift that brings back memories!,I purchased this as a gift for my father (who has everything) for Christmas. This was a hit for everyone in attendance! They loved watching him dig through the packing to see what candy he'd pull out next! There were quite a few candies that he hadn't seen in years-and he loved all the different kinds-from the candy cigarettes to the mustache! What a cute idea! The only complaint (if you could call it that) is we would have loved seeing doubles of some of the smaller candies in the box to fill it up a bit more. I would purchase again!
2,Mostly superficial and disappointing,"The book seems to consist of little more than recycled old newspaper and magazine articles coupled with bizarre personal attacks. It contains a lot of undocumented allegations when it comes to Steffis personal life, and when it comes to her tennis there is very little insightful information. It appears, the author has not bothered speaking with annyone close to Graf, and it shows all too clearly. Frankly, one does not get the impression that too much effort was put into this book."
1,Really quite awful,"The ""argument"" of this book can be summarized as follows:There is a soul, therefore there is a soul. What doyou mean you don't believe in a soul, I don't thinkyou're really being serious.The straw men that are taken to task in this rathersad and comic (unintentionally, of course) littlescreed can only impress people whose understanding ofscience is limited to watching re-runs of Star Trek.Anyone with even a competent undergraduate educationin science will find the descriptions in this bookrather embarrassing. And of course, the ""logic"" ofthe arguments is something any competent juniorhigh school student should be able to dismantle ona pop quiz.If you believe in the supernatural, fine. But let'snot pretend there are reasons to do so."
3,hilarious,"Come on... how can you not love this? It seems like some of the rock fans here just aren't getting down with the ""screwed & chopped"" thing. I mean, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WASTED ON PRESCRIPTION COUGH SYRUP WHILE LISTENING TO THIS. Of course it doesn't take that much skill to do this to an album, but if you're honestly as drunk as you're supposed to be while listening to this, you shouldn't care. Mowing the lawn doesn't take much skill either, but hey, the grass looks better that way.The People's Champ just wants you to get slizzard and listen to ""the first rock album ever to be screwed and chopped"". That's really funny. And stupid. Why so much hate? I was rocking to this, sober even."
1,Ugh...,"I was a fan of ""Haunted Cities"" for a while until I heard this. Seriously, it's not worth your money. You can get the exact same effect as on this album by opening up Sound Recorder in Windows and hitting ""Decrease speed"", I kid you not. There's nothing new or exciting about this, except that the album is a bit longer because every song is slowed down. I'd recommend the original ""Haunted Cities"", I guess, but I wouldn't even GIVE this chopped and screwed album to someone."
5,Transplants with a bit of Texas sound.,"I bought this cd to see what it sounds like and I was very impressed . Paul wall did a nice job slowing this down . This is the first rock album to be chopped and screwed and I think its very good . I hope to see other rock albums chopped and screwed in the near future . The best songs on this album are ""Gangstas and thugs"" , and ""What I cant describe"" with the booya tribe ."
5,Christmas Carol Krazy,"I Love the story of the Christmas Carol and what a better way to see it than with the ""Flintstones""!! If you have not seen this version of "" A Christmas Carol"" you should. It is true Hannah-Barbera fun! I would recommend this to all!"
5,Love FRED,Great VHS transferred it to DVD. Just as I remembered from my childhood. Not everyone has seen this before. Worth the purchase and transfer time.
3,"accurate, but don't bother buying this article","Cameron's article is well written about the dangers of phishing. Quite understandable to a general audience. But you can save yourself the cost of buying this article. If you are reading this review in a browser, then you have access to the Web. Just search for phishing and read some of the top results."
3,good not great,"I read several book about the agents of SOE who were dropped into France to aid the Resistance before I read this book and I guess they stole his thunder. This book did not really do it for me. I have a ton of admiration for Millar but the book was just not my style. It is good and was written right after the war so it is of great historical significance. It just did not make me want to pick up ""Horned Pigeon"" by Millar."
5,Go for it!,"Owned this for over 7 months now. Never had any problems with it. I use it with a PC with an iLink port. Write speeds typically are around 42X which is very repectable (on a 48X max speed CDR, which is probably the best you will find in a regular store). Moreover, the Roxio software that comes with it is excellent. I had used Nero 5 for a long time, before I started using Roxio and realized Nero wasn't really that great.A lot of people complain about their burners when its the quality of the CDRs (or even the software) they use. If you want a quality burner for a great price, this is it."
3,"Good performace, Reasonably priced.","After being a computer use for decades my recommendation is: Don't buy expensive external peripherials,(unless of course, you absolutely need it). An external peripherial's usb or firewire interface is prone to failure, and in most cases replacing the interface means replacing the entire chasis, wich could cost close to the drive's price. And worst of all, in time (say 6 months) the drive will become obsolete and your computer peripherial graveyard will grow bigger. CPUs monitors and printers can expect longer lifetimes, but a peripherials life is like that of a fly. Go for lowest price, if it's good enough for your basic needs, go for it. This drive offers excelent performance at a reasonable price."
3,product not delivered within specified time,"Caiman.com did not deliver the product within the initial specified delivery period of several weeks. After I contacted them at the end of this period, they informed me that the product was on back order. At this point, I cancelled the order and went elsewhere to find the product. My money was quickly refunded and I had no other problems."
5,Like New Again!,I have two Fujitsu scanners -- home and office -- and they were both doing the same thing -- pulling multiple sheets. So I was having to feed one sheet at a time if I wanted to scan. Made me not want to use them unless absolutely necessary. I ordered the pad assembly and pick roller (you need both) and both scanners are like new again! Parts are very easy to change!
4,scansnap part,worked like a charm to fix the problem with our scanners...must be a part that breaks and lucky Amazon had them.
1,bad parts,"I ordered the parts because my scanner was feeding more than one sheet at a time and I was told to replace this particular part to resolve the issue. After replacing the part, the problem still persists."
5,Tasty recipes that work,"Recipes in this cookbook are straight-forward and produce great results. I particular recommend the fish in coconut and coriander sauce (mashli ghashi) and leaf-wrapped fish (patra-ni-machchi). Chicken in yogurt (dahi murgh) was also a big hit. The author is especially attentive to the use of spices and gives clear instructions to get the most from them. It takes time and attention to produce a main dish and vegetable, but it is worth the effort."
4,Fine Rohmer,"A Summer's Tale is a typical Eric Rohmer film, and for those unfamiliar with Rohmer, this is as good a place to stast as any. For those who are willing to lose themselves in Rohmer's style of film-making, A Summer's Tale has many rewards. For those who do not appreciate Rohmer's style, well, at least you gave it a try. To criticize a Rohmer film for being wordy and having no plotline is tantamount to criticizing a Hitchcock film for being suspenseful. Rohmer makes films in which you learn about characters through the conversations, not through the story line. They require patience and are certainly not for every taste. Much like films by the Japanese master Ozu, by the end, even though not much has ""happened,"" somehow we have a much better understanding of who these characters are."
3,Better than the new version,"If I hadn't watched this right after yours,mine and ours I might have liked it better, but it just couldn't compare to that movie. This was all right-fairly humorous, Clifton Webb was great as Frank Gilbreth, father of 12.It was made in 1950 however, and it feels a little outdated.Still, MUCH better than the 2003 remake! A good family movie."
3,ok,I now know why they re did this one it is deffinately not as funny as the new one but it was ok some funny bits.
5,dvd,Love the old classics and the actors from those times. A must have dvd and what a bargain with 2movies on one dvd.
4,DOUBLE THE VALUE,"Two fine films of the kind that they certainly don't make anymore,good quality prints..Belles on their toes is as so often with sequels,, not a patch on the original, but well worth watching to complete the story..similar to the second Miniver movie..THE MINIVER STORY"
4,Bad translation,"I think that there is a good balance between text and images, and the images are of high quality. However, this book and other Taschen books that I have read suffer from poor translation. I work in translation and it appears to me that they did not use a native English speaker to translate from the German, as there are quite a few clunky sentences."
1,Unhappy,This short as a product is terrific but the description is not correct. It is mens and it does not say that anywhere. It is huge on my daughter who takes Ladies small. I had to reorder and buy youth size.
4,Reality Check.,By the time you finish this book you will know if you have what is required to take your writing to the next level. Do you long to publish? Are you ready to start submitting your writing? Find out and get lots of helpful tips along the way.
4,Warning: wrong play list,"As of 8-25-06, the listed tracks have been switched with ""Jazz for a rainy afternoon"". I bought this for the ""St.Louis Blues"" track. When I got the Open Road CD, it wasn't there.However the music is so good I didn't care and will just buy ""Rainy Afternoon"". The Savoy series has over 50 minutes of music per CD. I like that there are different groups on each CD. All are in the same style of music but with different sounds. Open Road has one vocal per disc, the rest is instrumental. A lot of music for the money. The sound quality is good too."
4,Actual track list,"DISC 1:1. Iron City - Grant Green2. Comin' Home Baby - Eddie ""Lockjaw"" Davis3. Theme For Malcolm - Donald Byrd4. Groove's Groove - Richard ""Groove"" Holmes5. Shana - David ""Fathead"" Newman6. All The Things You Are - Sonny Criss7. When They Ask About You - Ernie Andrews8. Tetragon - Woody Shaw9. Bloomido - Hank Jones10.

5,Excellent TV series,Good Neighbors is an excellent TV series and I only wish we had such quality TV in the USA. We have to depend on the Brits and others to bring us high quality TV.
4,Great collection of a classic series,"I used to watch this show when I was growing up, and seeing it again has brought back some great memories (plus now I get the more adult-oriented humor.) The show itself is just a fantastic comedy. Every character is lovable in their own way, and the humor varies from subtle to obvious. Also, as an American I enjoy listening to the language used in 70's London. You can read the synopsis yourself, I'll only say that if you enjoy class-oriented humor, and can tolerate not knowing what every word means, you'll love this show."
4,Old fashioned British,"Great old fashioned British humor. Great to watch this kind of straight forward comedy, no crudity, no swearing, amazing."
4,Good Neighbors = grood British comedy,I became a big fan of this series while watching it on PBS television many years ago. I was so happy to see that it had finally come out on DVD. All I need now is the to buy the 4th season. I have many happy memories of this series. I had a big crush of Felicity Kendall. And I haven't seen anything with Richard Briers that I haven't liked.
3,Perhaps an Acquired Taste?,"Typically British, there isn't a lot of action here, but the characters are given good humor. If you give them time to grow on you, and can in the least identify with the ""homesteading"" ethic of a 1960's generation contrasted with ""elitist"" snobbery, there's some chance you can enjoy some of these episodes. The primary couple are a hoot. ~ww"
2,The Bad Neighbours,In Britain we call the Good Neighbours the Good Life. It is a gentle sitcom repeated on UK Gold that is occasionally funny. If you haven't seen it you crazy Yanks you will enjoy it. But then it becomes a recurring pain in the brain lobe.
5,Something you won't regret!,"There's a reason the Queen regarded this program as one of her great favorites.The four main characters quickly become your ""friends"" that you can return to visit as often as you wish, especially cheering on Tom and Barbara as they embark on a lifestyle that maybe more of us should be willing to consider. But in the middle of a London suburb?!? I fell in love with this program and the characters the first time I saw it on PBS. OK, maybe I secretly fell in love with Felicity Kendall (Barbara), but even everyone I've shown episodes to has each and every one thoroughly enjoyed them, and I'm sure anyone else who even remotely likes Britcoms will have a grand experience watching the Goods. Oh, and don't forget series 4 also."
5,A very delightful series.,"We found the ""Good Neighbors"" series to be very entertaining. The acting is great and the British humor delightful."
4,Funny and Sexy,"This book was very entertaining. It's not as complex and heartwarming as Sarah's other books, but more consistent with other books within the Blaze collection. It was very funny and filled with really HOT scenes. Both main characters are loveable, and it was a pleasure to spend an afternoon reading about them."
3,Could be better,"Good colander, terrific idea, but not up to OXO's outstanding standards. The convertible feature works really well, and I enjoy the many options it affords me. But the colander itself doesn't have holes everywhere, leaving significant areas that can hold water, so you have to tip it this way and that in order to make sure your food is completely drained. The other annoyance I've found is that there's some kind of invisible channel in the underside of the handles that collects and holds water in the dishwasher, dumping a waterfall on your clean, dry dishes when you pick up the colander to put it away. This really bugs me."
3,great while it lasted,"I loved this colander for draining pasta but the handle broke off after a year, disappointing. I would choose something more durable."
4,"Pricey, but effective","For years, I'd struggled with heaving pots of boiling water to the sink and attempting to dump the contents into a colander, where the backwash of hot water would inevitably flood whatever I was cooking and end up splashing me in the process. Last year I ended up purchasing the Oxo convertible colander, which is a lifesaver (that, and buy a pasta pot). It has foldable legs that extend to fit over the edges of your sink, holding the colander in place so you can keep both hands on the pot of boiling water. The holes wrap around the sides and the bottom, so your contents drain evenly. When you're finished, the legs simply fold down and you can slide the colander onto a shelf for easy storage (it's also a great place to stash frequently used baking / cook's tools such as mini pastry rollers and tartlette pans). This is definitely one of the handiest, best-designed kitchen tools I own."
2,Not worth the money,"For $25, I expected something that would last more than a year. Got this for Christmas last year, and one of the handles broke completely off a few weeks ago (October). Do yourself a favor and buy a different product.Follow up: Two days after I posted this review, the other handle fell off. I won't be buying from this company again."
2,OXO COLANDER: GREAT IDEA POORLY EXECUTED,"OXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Convertible ColanderWeak handles and poor customer response are this product's Achilles heels. While the concept is attractive, we've broken handles on two of them. The handle's connection stainless steel bowl are very poorly designed and constructed with materials that do not withstand normal use to which this $34.99 dollar product would reasonably be subjected. With regards to customer service, I tried to contact OXO about getting replacement handles, but received no responses."
5,Informative book,Miniature Pinschers (A Complete Pet Owner's Manual)A very helpful book. Arrived promptly in excellent condition.
1,Tassimo should be better than this!,"The chocolate syrup taste of this one is off the mark! Surprising, because their coffees and teas are so good! I buy this because it's cheaper than buying another brand of coffee maker. But then again, is it?"
1,To be perfectly honest...,"This is by far the worst hot chocolate I've ever had and trust me, I'm a chocolate lover...The taste is too artificial, it's not creamy, it leaves a bad after taste, and it fills only half of a cup. Now I assume the half a cup is so we can pour milk after but if it's already horribly ruined, why bother?The Tassimo machine is great besides their choice of certain products to compliment it, like this. Nastyyy..."
1,Artificial and Nasty,This hot chocolate is completely artificial and tastes that way too. I have tried it and do not recommend it.
2,Not a great book.,It really does not tell you what you want to know. This is just one perspective of the batter for Little Round Top. I would not waist my money on this book.
5,If I'd only known then....,"I first read this book after ending a 4 year relationship. I remember standing in the bookstore looking (skeptically) at all of the relationship books, when the title of this one caught my eye. I said to myself, ""yeah, right"". When I picked it off the shelf, I noticed a quote from Marianne Williamson, who at the time was the Spiritual Leader of the church I was attending. Having much respect for her, I read the first few pages. Immediately, I was hooked. I after reading the book, I purchased two more copies for single friends. (I'm actually online this morning to purchase more copies) As I explained to them, the title really doesn't do the book justice. For me, it was more than getting married, it was about understanding myself and my energy and the role I played in relationships."
3,Her theory is too general to apply to everyone,"I can't believe this woman needed a PhD to learn men should be masculine and women should be feminine in relationships. The basics of this book is men should play the masculine role and women should be feminine or if you are opposite you have to find the opposite in a partner.She includes tests to see which traits you have. I had mostly feminine but some masculine. She goes on the say I need to ""fix"" the masculine traits. I'm sorry, we do not need to change ourselves to find the right partner unless we have a problem.I do recommend the book for successful women who have been unsuccessful in relationships because they are acting too masculine (paying for dates, buying him gifts, etc).I do not agree that men are turned off by women who initiate sex!!!"
1,"Getting to ""I Do""","This book was recommended to me by an acquaintance. I really wish this acquaintance luck in relationships because she absolutely loved this book. I can't place my finger on specifics, but while reading the book, I got a bad, sinking feeling. I understand the whole female & male energies, yes, but I feel that what the author tells ""feminine"" women to do is inauthentic. A lot of the examples and stories rang false and I was taken aback. I thought, ""Really? that's what she considers narcisistic or female or male? Wow."" Nothing jived with common sense. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody."
5,Getting to I do,I love this book. It was a quick read for me although much of what is written in the book I already knew and I was putting into practice. I still think that it is a great book for women who eventually want to get married. They can follow the principles in the book. I know from experience it works.
2,Great For First Few Chapters!,"Automatically, I knew this was a fantastic book. I loved how Pat explained feminine energy women vs. masculine energy women and what the difference was. She helped me understand my role as a masculine energy woman. However after the first 7 chapters, the book went downhill. After that all she mainly referred back to was the feminine energy women. After the first 7 chapters, she left us masculine energy women out in the dust. That was what really bothered me. ""Getting to `I Do'"" is a great read for the first seven chapters and then that is it. Unfortunately from what I could tell, there are not many books out there for us masculine energy women."
2,so so,"All of the tracks are from the original artists - however, all the tracks have been re-recorded and not as good as the original songs when they were first recorded."
2,Not as good as the book,Maybe I should have known better because the audio book is only two CD's but I was disappointed that it's not the entire book on CD. These two CD's contain a fraction of information from the book. I think the book is so full of essential information that the audio CD's only contain a small piece of the author's subject.
4,Positive spin on old theory,Seligman's learned helplessness theory is a mainstay in any general psychology course. Learned optimism puts a much more positive spin on things. Book was somewhat trendy and written for everyone so it is accessible to anyone who hasn't got a background in psychology which is good. If you are interested in his ideas...check out William Glasser - Choice Theory...it is a good companion.
2,Keep walking...don't pick this book up,"I think I was expecting something else from this book. This book left me bored and reading it took me back to my experiences in high school when I was forced to read some boring text book. I found the majority of this book to be nothing more than an author bragging about their past. Too much of this publication was about research the author had done and findings they had concluded. It was a well-written book but I was expecting to see something more along the lines of ""this is what is wrong = this will fix it"". If you are looking for simple and direct information about how you are feeling then I suggest finding another book."
3,One or two great insights,Go to a bookstore and read the first chapter to two. The rest of the book just repeats it. Not bad just... the same.
4,A book that enlightens the reader,"This book helped me understand pessimism and optimism. Dr. Selligman explains when pessimism works and when optimism is preferable. If you are interested in thinking, this book is aworthwhile read."
3,Trying to follow,The book was OK. I found that 3/4 of the book were spent defending his theory and how he derived it. If you're reading his book for 'learned optimism' then this background information is not very helpful. I felt that I could have skipped 90% of the book and still taken away from it what I have. It helps to an extent but I would recommend searching for a different book that might be more helpful.Good luck and happy reading.
1,Kindle edition missing content,"Got the kindle edition because I lost my paperback and wanted the resource for seligman's model of ABCDE. Guess what. the index of the paperback includes a reference to ABCDE but the kindle search shows 0 entries. Tried activity, beliefs, consequences, etc and all showed 0 results. Not the complete book. returned."
1,Not recommended,"this is only for people that have no personality, or are clinically depressed.it is NOT for someone looking for out-going self selling info."
2,Not a good self-help book,"This book is NOT a good self-help book. The interested reader would be better off reading Richard Burns,Aaron Beck or Edmund Bourne. Rather it provides scientific evidence of how / why cognitive therapy works - Dr Seligman gives details of the various ""experiments"" he has conducted over the years and how he has put the results to good use in industry / sport and personal health.The evidence is clearly provided and well-written in an upbeat style. The actual self-help part of the book only lasts about 20 or 30 pages - most of the book gives the background and examples of where cognitive therapy has been used succesfully.If you need help with anxiety, depression etc this book is not the first recommendation (see above) - however if you are interested in the background of how cognitive therapy developed, along with the evidence to support its use then it is a quite enjoyable read."
2,Good ideas but too much technical information.,The book makes good points but it is a hard read due to the enormous amount of scientific and technical information included. I would not recommend this book.
3,not bad!,"i found the book interesting and, being a psychologist myself, entirely applicable to my client group (children in primary and secondary ed settings). i think that someone who does not have a background in psychology might find the ideas addressed superficial or hard to follow or difficult to apply in real life. personally, i think that it could be used with clients in all age groups as long as the clients come to believe in the theory of personal choice and internal control."
5,After several years I'm still using this technique,"I read this book at least five years ago and am still using the A,B,C,D,E technique that I discovered in LEARNED OPTIMISM to bring myself out of a funk very quickly. Am I a completely changed person? Probably not. I still tend to get into the blahs, but now, partially with the help of this wonderful book, I have a tool that gets me going in the right direction within minutes. I've even done the technique in my head when I wake in the night with churning thoughts. Most of the time I relax deeply enough to go right back to sleep. Dr. Segliman is one of only two authors to whom I've ever sent a fan letter. I'm truly grateful for this book. It works if you do!"
4,A Breakthrough Book,"This book remains a breakthrough book. It shows how important our overall viewpoint and perspective influence our lives and our success in them. Instead of focusing on dysfunction and pathology, the author explores how he was led to understanding what makes people successful. Get ready to have your notions of the mind as drummed into students in psychology class challenged.Unfortunately, the author only devotes about 20 percent of the book on how people themselves can cleanse themselves, their family members, and their co-workers from undue pessimism and negative thought and toward an optimistic, productive and successful future."
2,Disappointing,"This book was disappointing. From the title, I thought it will teach you how to be optimistic but it went on circles without focusing on the key optimistic ability and how to acquire those skills."
5,Highest recommendation,"I have used and applied the wisdom from this book for the last 10+ years. It is logical and actually works. I owe him a debt of gratitude, as do many many others for writing this book.Thank you, Dr. Seligman!"
4,A New Angle to Psychology,"An easy-to-read introduction to the world of Dr. Seligmann, the cognitive world, with tests galore to make you rethink your reactions and behavior patterns. Missed a deeper dive into the theories, but followed the history of how psychology changed with enthusiasm."
3,Missing the Optimism test,"I like the book, purchased the Audio version, but the Test to test our opt-pes inclinations is missing. Rather strange, as taking that test seem to be very important."
5,Excellent!!,This book arrived promptly and on time. It is an awesome book that I could read again and again. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to change their view of life.
5,Great Book!,"Item was received very fast. It was a little rough, but was described as such so no surprises. Excellent book! Would definitely do business again."
2,Okay...But not great,"This book does offer some useful advice, thus the two stars but it is not a great book.I would recommend Patterns Of Depression or any good NLP book by Bandler and Grinder. Anthony Robbins Awaken the Giant also offers some useful strategies to offset depression that work faster and better than what is in this book.I recommend that you borrow this from your library and save the money for a better book."
2,Nothing new or not obvious here,"It's not that the information insn't correct, but it certainly isn't insightful. This seems like a mental exercise for a professor who just wants to get his name in print. Right away you're in trouble becuase he has you go through an exercise and then rate your optimism to see if this book could help you. if you are low on optimism, you need this book, if you are balanced, you need this book and if you are very optimistic, you still need this book.My view, try to see things from others perspective and find out what your unique service and contribution is to a given situation and ulitmaley your whole life. The rest will fall into place."
2,Good Info; not enough of it to warrant a book of this size,"The book makes some excellent and rather useful points regarding learned optimism, cognitive therapy, and thought patterns. It also contains some useful inventory tests. However, this whole book could've probably been written in around half the space. It is very redundant. Again, good info but he is long winded and could explain the whole book much more quickly and efficiently. I consider checking it out at a library first."
3,I FEEL BETTER ALREADY,"This book offers a treatise for being optimistic and enjoying life to the hilt. It's only partially successful.My main complaint with the book is the somewhat preachy tone and the manner in which the author patronizes the reader. If you can get past this, you may be able to find some really solid advice here.And keep reading. The second half of the book is superior to the first.A smilar book, perhaps slightly better in some ways (and less effective in others) is HAPPIER.Happier: Learn the Secrets to Daily Joy and Lasting Fulfillment"
4,Can't go wrong with this book,"Dr. Seligman is the former president of the American Psychological Association and one of the important scientific pioneers when it comes to understanding the causes of depression. He describes a lot of the background research which some may find excessive, but it is really a fascinating exposition. His ""how-to"" is very, very good. I AM A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST WHO SEES CLIENTS AND I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO MY PATIENTS IN MY PRACTICE."
5,If You Want To Be Happy For The Rest Of Your Life...,"Pessimism is a disability. It's a legitimate handicap. Maybe you won't get a handicapped parking sticker for your car, but there's no doubt that negative thinking will limit you in many ways, including your happiness level. Dr. Seligman champions the benefits of optimism. He knows. He's done the research. He is the father of the field of ""positive psychology"" which is transforming psychology in general and psychotherapy in particular. This book delivers. ""Learned optimism"" will change your mind and your life. If your glass is half empty, or even if it's half full, you'll benefit from this book."
4,Better Than Most,"I found Learned Optimism better than most self-help genre books because it hits the sweet spot between peer-reviewed academic publication and unsubstantiated junk (i.e. John Gray science). Learned Optimism is enjoyable to read and I learned a great deal about the science of my anxiety and depression. The tools for fixing both fall a bit short, but I don't know what I was expecting to get out of a book!"
4,The Little Book of Creativity,"I am not familiar with this author and his previous work but I am aiming to learn more about creativity and using my mind to accomplish more and learn faster.This book was a pleasant surprise. Packed with insights on how to start thinking more creatively and stories about famous thinkers of history (Da Vinci, Einstien, Newton) used their minds.Some of the suggestions discussed: use illustrations in your note taking, generate ideas - your power to generate ideas is infinite, see the relationships between things, improve your vocabulary, brainstorm, slow down, etc.The key to it all is associations. In physics and nature and other things, there are similar systems and ideas.Relate to new ideas by forming associations to what you already know.Listen to different types of music, read a variety of books and read often.I really liked this book and see it as a start to my journey to understanding creativity."
4,Family Recipes,"When I started reading through the Wiseguy Cookbook, I felt like I was reading a cookbook from my own Italian Family! All the recipes are similiar to the home cooking that I grew up with my Italian heritage. Very easy to read and understand, and not alot of time in preparation! Good Book, Goodfella !"
5,A terrific cookbook and THE BEST Xmas gift this season!,"I collect cookbooks and this one is the latest and great addition to my library. Not only is it filled with wonderful recipes, it's also a hoot to read! I'm buying this for everyone on this year's Christmas list."
5,I love this cookbook!!,I finally have learned how to cook since I purchased this cookbook!! The helpful hints Henry gives about how to make thedishes are awesome! I have never eaten or cooked so well! Thestories behind the recipes are fun and interesting reading! Loveyou Henry!!
5,It's MADE!,"I got this for my boyfriend who is totally into the mob thing. So anyways, he made some chicken catetori it was delicious! Thank you Henry Hill!"
5,The best Leatherman tool!,"The Charge Ti is the most useful tool Leatherman makes. I bought the XTi and this one is better. You get a pair of scissors that the XTi doesn't have. Both have the extra bits too. I also like the Ti in Oxide Black too. The size of this tool makes it perfect for my hand. If I were doing anything more than camping I would have bought the Surge, because it is bigger, but I will never give this one up."
1,Worthless............,I HAVE YET TO RECIEVE THIS ITEM IT'S BEEN 4 DAYS PAST THE ESTIMATED ARRIVAL DATE AND I PAID FOR 1 DAY SHIPPING. I WANTED TO WEAR IT FOR MY BIRTHDAY YESTURDAY AND I ENDED UP HAVING TO GO OUT THE DAY OF AND BUY MY OWN AT A STORE NEARBY. I'M VERY DISSAPOINTED AND I PLAN TO RETURN IT AS SOON AS I GET IT! IT MAY HAVE BEEN A GOOD BRA BUT IT'S WORTHLESS IF IT ISN'T DELIVERED ON TIME!!!!
5,Best Strapless I ever owned,"I love love love this Bra, I bought it to try under my wedding dress and have not stopped wearing it since, so I had to buy another which is the one I just got and I am going to buy all colours.I am a plus size and busty this bra just doesn't move it stays right therr and has the best support, I even prefer it to the longline bras I tried for under my wedding dress."
5,Lilyette strapless bra,Item was perfect in every way. This bra is very well made. I will buy from this seller in the future.
1,Wrong Item,"As has happened several times before when ordering off Amazon, I received the wrong product. It wasn't even a strapless bra! And from a different company! I did go buy this product at the mall after returning my purchase from Amazon and I love the bra."
3,Just another strapless bra,This strapless bra does what it is supposed to do. That's about all I can say about it. Extremely tight around while a little loose in the cups.
5,VERY sturdy!,First of all I've never seen anything so white! It was hard to look at. Very smooth adges. The cups seem a little tall but I've sure that's for the secureness.
3,Thought it was a wireless* strapless bra...the cups are not enclosed as it looks like in the pic,"I thought I would be a wireless* strapless bra, but I found out that there some kind of hard things on the bottom of the cups. Not that it was uncomfortable....but I didn't expect there to be hard things under the cups. Gives great support but the tops of the bra seems to just to be kinda open and it kinda sems to hang around there. Wish it would be top of the bra would be closer/tighter to the top of my chest....Gives good support, but if it doesnt stick to my chest and only be tight around the bottom, it isnt the one for me....Oh well I have yet to find that one great strapless bra...."
3,Disappointed,"These bras don't fit like they do on the model. As with previous reviewers, I found that they are very lose in the cup area. As a result I have not worn them and I don't really know if I will. A very good buy is the minimizer bra by this same seller. I love them. Unfortunately I don't see them in white. I would love white ones, but only black and another nude-looking color is available, when I checked. Please consider white ones!"
5,great,this is a large blind not hard to put up and tear down.....it seats 4 people comfortably and with space left....
2,Size isn't everything,"The blind is big. And conceptually, it could be a good blind. Very poor build quality though, from puncture holes due to poor stitching, to actually being able to see pin holes in the fabric in the middle of the walls and ceiling. Perhaps I just received a completely defective unit, but I am not willing to gamble again-returned. For the price, it should be of higher quality. Felt like an $80 blind, not $150."
5,Great hunting blind,This is my second of this blind.I bow hunt and this blind is great size for bow hunting for a full easy draw of the bow.Easy to set up and very well made. Lots of room and easy windows to show out of.Highly recommend this product. Great transaction with Amazon and good price.
3,whats the point,"This blind is plenty high enough to stand in while shooting a bow. My only issue is what is the point of the shoot through mesh windows? They are so low the only way you can shoot through them is if you are sitting on the ground. You have no choice but to open the triangles to shoot through even from a stool. Even when you do that it let's the mesh barley supported. I will be looking for a stand or another blind with higher windows.Pros. Easy set up, great hight, blends well with surroundingsCons. Shoot through mesh is to low, windows and mesh need separated for better mesh support when the windows are open."
2,"Poor Quality, End Rod is Bent","This Hoppe's Cleaning Rod set (Item# 3PU) consists of three aluminum rods and two plastic slotted attachments (.22 & .30 caliber). The rod with the handle on it swivels. Open the plastic package carefully if you want to keep it for storage. The aluminum isn't finished or polished. It just looks like raw stock. I cleaned it before first use.The first set I ordered, the end rod (rod farthest from the handle) was slightly bent/warped. I returned it and got a new set. The end rod was bent on this set as well. It still fits down my .22 barrel, but there can be a slight bow and rubbing when force is applied to the rod. I expected better quality from Hoppe's. My last Hoppe's rod set was perfect and lasted me 15+ years. I'll probably try an Outers rod next."
2,"If you have a large head, these are the headphones for you!","Well, my head is a normal size, but the headband on this set of headphones is too large for me. Even when I make the headband as short as I can, it moves forward or backward on my head; it does not stay in place.I thought the price was great on this item, but now I see why it's so inexpensive--the quality of the headphones is fine, but the size of the the headband is a major problem. I have to adjust it about 10 times during a 25-minute run because it slides down the back or front of my head!"
5,"From American Journal of Epidemiology, Vol. 159, No. 8","""This is the only volume available to address worldwide surveillance, and indeed it may be used immediately by those working internationally with such agencies as the World Bank, US Agency for International Development (USAID), foundations, and others.""Norma Kanarek, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD"
3,Nicci Gilbert,Bought this because I had just watched R and B Divas. Love her from Brownstone. This is an ok cd. I don't think this is her best but she does have a few good songs on here.
5,There is no substitute for hard work...,"I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Watson previously and this book is every bit delightful and enlightening as she is. Her book shows that strength of character, passion and hard work are the most important components to a successful business career and happy life. She brings her subjects to life, and leaves the reader with the impression of really knowing these super-achievers at a very intimate level. How They Achieved is a badly needed antidote to the Internet generation's belief of overnight success."
2,Not What I Expected,"I'm not exactly sure how to describe why I did not like this book. The word ""unprofessional"" comes to my head. The author's writing style is not very polished or professional, to the effect that I found that it completely distracted me from enjoying the book. The entire book has a very unpolished feel about it and I did not find it nearly as inspiring or eye-opening as I expected it to be. Others seemed to like this book, so perhaps I set my expectations to high. But for the unusually high price of this Kindle edition, high expectations are not completely unwarranted."
1,Close'em & take a nap!,"Tom Cruise is completely out of his element in this film. As a remake of Abres los ojos it carries nothing of the impact the original has. Penelope Cruz is a shell of the actress she is in the original here, and Cameron Diaz does not belong in drama (or in much else). While I found the original intoxicating, this version just annoyed the hell out of me."
2,A retread from Crowe and Cruise,"This reworking of Open Your Eyes just does not work. Despite the obvious efforts of everyone concerned, they cannot meet the level of their previous version.This is a retread of the work of the rightly acclaimed Alejandro Amenábar's 1997 work, and the film has nothing more to offer.Only the arrival of the technical support gives the film any life at all.Tom Cruise shows the limitations of his acting in this film. Cameron Diaz is intolerably beautiful and cannot hit the note required. Penelope Cruz phones in her part.Sometimes Hollywood can remake a film very well, but they cannot in this case."
5,tonight you fly so high....in the vanilla sky,"This is an incredible movie.Totally amazing performance delivered by Cruise, and amazing direction by Cameron Crowe.Don't believe the negativism over this movie.It's an amazing story ( matryx anyone??? ), food for thought...it sticks in your mind for days!!It has touches of romance, suspense and it's even a bit scary.I can't compare it to the original feature, Abre Los Ojos, because Vanilla Sky has a different aproach to the plot, let's say that things are warmer here and each film is a winner.The photography of the film is superb and the DVD has an amazing picture quality to it.Great music for your delight and fine fine performances by Jason Lee, Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz.This is a no brainer for the casual viewer and a MUST for Tom Cruise and Cameron Crowe fans...Trust me...you won't be disappointed!!!!!"
5,amazing movie,"I agree with most of the reviews here, it was an excellent and highly underrated movie. It's very surreal and involves some abstract thinking that most people don't appreciate.. it makes you question the little things around you and the quality of your own life. The people who enjoy this movie are those with open minds....open your eyes! I will buy this movie when it comes out on DVD!"
2,"Watch ""Open Your Eyes"" instead","""Open Your Eyes"" was much better than ""Vanilla Sky."" ""Vanilla Sky"" mostly copied ""Open Your Eyes"" but was too obvious and less convincing. (And Tom Cruise, though good in some roles, didn't fit this role well.) ""Open Your Eyes"" takes a little longer to draw you in, but once it has you there it takes you far beyond where ""Vanilla Sky"" does. Also, the Jungian Dream aspect in ""Vanilla Sky"" is poorly done, whereas ""Open Your Eyes"" represents the dream experience very well. I recommend watching both movies before you buy one. But if you're going to buy, get ""Open Your Eyes."""
1,Yikes,This was the most bizarre movie I have ever seen! I had a huge headache by the time it was over. The movie trailer lead you to believe it was a fatal attraction type thriller but it's really not - its about something totally different and way to far fetched for me! I didn't like it at all!
1,Vanilla Ripoff,"I never thought it possible, but I guess it is. Two different directors, with different actors in a different locale and THE SAME STORY. One gets it right, in this case the original and the other, well, makes a mess of it.I literally burst out laughing when Cruise did his little jump in the air to demonstrate his frustration with his team of surgeons. Cruise didn't want to play it like Edwardo Noriega so he took it to the other extreme - infantile.There was alot of that in this movie. The way in which Sophia reacts when she thinks she's in love with Cruise's character. Squeeling like a child. And to top it all off, Tom Cruise couldn't dare to hide his face under grotesque makeup (as did Edwardo Noriega in the far superior and more mature ""Abre Los Ojos"") because afterall, how else would people recognize the great Tom Cruise.And if someone can explain the title, be my guest.Two thumbs way down."
3,"Cruise was good, but the plot was too tangled to unwind","Not bad, but not anything groundbreaking either. Even though Cruise was good, and the movie seemed like it was going to turn out decent, it was droll and centered more on Cruise doing his thing with his girlfriend(s) more than anything else. The ending was hard to figure out also, did he take reality or just the dream world?On the whole, the movie led up to something, but never really seemed to capture it altogether. It was as if Cameron Crowe had a good idea what he wanted, but didn't know how to make it seem presentable.Good for Cruise fans, but for those that like me that just watch him just because, it might not be a good idea to view this film. Unless you have two hours to kill."
5,Lost and found,"I thought that vanilla sky is one of the most unusual films in the best of ways. It starts of in one place and takes you where you would never have imagined. All of the acting was first rate from the leads to the extras including Mr Spielberg. Vanilla sky is like a drug, its addictive, it makes you feel good, and it opens your eyes, its like a beautiful love poem."
1,Confused disaster,This is one of the worst big budget films i have ever seen. after the equally turgid Eyes Wide Shut I would have hoped Tom Cruise would steer clear of nonesense such as this. If there is one thing guaranteed to annoy it is directors who work on the Emperors New Clothes approach i.e. make your film so obscure that the critics are scared to critisise it too much in case it does have a hidden message. Well the news is it has no message other than how on earth did this come from the same director as Almost Famous. If I could give it no stars I would do so without hesitation.
2,Tom Cruise Makes Another Flop,"This guy hasn't made a decent movie since Far and Away. Vanilla Sky is just another one of those out-there movies that you have to think way to hard to follow. Then on top of this, the story is a mind bender only to conceal the ending. They try to keep you guessing till the end where you will be completely let down by the lame ending. The only scene worth wathcing in this whole movie is when they get in that car crash, but that was probably only worth seeing in the movie theater with the great sound and big screen. You couldn't pay me to see another Tom Cruise movie after his long string of wierd movies. To top it off the guy has been rated as the most annoying actor of 2005. I think its affecting the movies."
1,Must be in a competition for most screwed up movie.,"This movie was a waste of a couple of talented actors. What is the deal with so many movies coming out with mind twisting, flashback, flashforward, ""where in the hell am I?"" story lines?? Plus, apparently you always need a ""violent"" sex scene or whatever. I think the director had a little trouble putting on to screen what was in the writers imagination. Messed up!!"
2,Vanilla Sky,"This is another one of those movies when you never get a firm grip on what reality is. (Like ""Last Action Hero."") That keeps you from getting truly interested in the movie's plot. As soon as you think you have things figured out and you become interested, you realize it's yet another dream. I wouldn't have been so disappointed if this film hadn't been advertised as a psychological thriller about a young lady who faked her death to stalk an ex-lover. That is definitely not the plot. It's an art film and I did not like it."
1,What a mess.,"This movie should not have even gotten one star. The story line is totally nuts. At the end, you wonder what the whole thing was about. What a disappointing movie; even the acting was weak."
1,Pass the coffee to stay awake through this Vanilla Nightmare,"What a total boring experience. It only took Cameron Crowe 2 1/2 hours to finally make the point to Appreciate What You Have and Take Nothing For Granted. I almost feel sorry for Tom Cruise (or was I feeling sorry for myself dozing off waiting for the punchline?) to watch him bumble his way through this Slug disguised as a movie. Tom, be a little pickier in the future when you're reading scripts, you've earned it."
2,Too much Tom,"Didn't really turn me on. I haven't seen the original Spanish version, Abre Los Ojos, to make a fair comparison, but I understand that that version was a lot better.I'm going to say that I thought the ending was a cop out. I suppose this was meant to be a sci-fi film in the first place, but nothing in this movie left clues along the way to lead me to believe this was something other than a love story gone wrong. So when the ending crops up, I think, ""What? What happened?"" Probably too much Tom. He seems to have to inhabit every scene that exists in his movies.The curious question is what does Penelope Cruz thinks of the American versio of the movie she originally mad ein her native tongue?"
1,Let's put it this way-VERY strange!,"O.K. I LOVE Tom, but come on! This movie was just weird. I did not like it at all and would not reccomend it."
1,Really a depressing film from people I love.,"I love all the people involved in the project. But simply this film is way too depressing. Great concept, it just doesn't work and now I need some happy pills."
2,Not too good,"The movie wasn't too good. The only reason I watched it is because of the celebrities in this movie, other than that, the movie is quite boring."
4,"Don't blink, you might miss something..","I was glued to this movie and didn't want to get up for ANY reason for fear of missing something. There is one thing in a movie that I cannot stand, predictability. This film is one that keeps your attention and you cannot guess the ending for anything.It's wildly entertaining and the twists and turns are as equally thrilling as any roller coaster."
2,Lacking Interest,"I am a big Tom Cruise fan, especially of his early work, but i am not a fan of this movie. I will admit though, that empty Times Square scene was pretty cool. Throughout the movie i found myself struggling to stay interested. And i thought i would get a ending to atleast explain alot of the film, but i felt i didn't, im not a fan of Cameron Crowe's films, and this is why. This movie did get over a 100 million, barley, i think mainly because it's a Tom Cruise flick. I truely recommend you rent this, before buying it."
1,Probably the worst movie ever made,"I disliked this movie. I couldn't wait for it to end. It seemed four hours long. I've been a long time Tom Cruise fan, but I'll not be in a hurry to buy his next. I feel as if the reviewers who gave this a 5-star rating owe me the price of the DVD. I can't think of a worse movie."
5,Beautiful Film,"This movie was amazing. It is something you can't just sit there and watch. You have to figure out things, look for details, and most importantly USE YOUR BRAIN. It looks as though some people that saw this film didn't. This is the type of movie that can really make you think about your own life and what really matters to you. It's the little things, not money, or fame or anything else materialistic. It's about love, it's about a tiny freckle on your lover. Wonderful film. I also saw ""Open Your Eyes"" in which Penelope Cruz also plays Sophia, it is the original spanish version. Penelope & Tom where made to play David & Sophia. This movie means a lot to me. The more times you watch this film the more you will understand it's meaning."
2,Another Hollywood copy...,"The movie is OK, the acting is average and Cruise makes a good role, BUT... the story is completely copied from Spanish film ""Abre los ojos"" which is way better. The story is amazing, but I really dislike the fact that Vanilla Sky stole the COMPLETE story, and I mean, WHOLE and COMPLETE story, when the Spanish version is extraordinary. If you can, check it out!"
3,Better than Vanilla Coke,"This is one of those movies that I kept passing up at the video store. The trailers to this film did not give enough information about the movie and left too much to the imagination. Tom Cruise being the main star is not enough in my opinion to warrant seeing this. Finally, after starring at it for weeks on my cousins shelf, I borrowed it. I now know why they could not show much in the previews. This movie will have you questioning what is going on from the very beginning all the way till the end. The timeline in the movie is not very realistic. Can't say too much about the movie or it will give it away. Both Tom and Cameron give good performances and I recommend seeing this film. I do however, think the ending could have been a little better."
2,Annoying film tries to be clever,"Let's be clear about this: for the most part, Vanilla Sky is an absolute bore. The characters lack warmth, the dialogue is dull, and annoying cliches are hiding under every rock. It tries desperately to be interesting and clever, but ends up merely pretentious and tedious.Viewers must wait until the last segment to find something of interest, but by then we have lost interest enough to cease caring. The final twist (remembering that every movie these days has to go one better than the last clever twist on reality) is fascinating enough, but comes too late to redeem a movie whose annoying 'pop' style and vacuous and lengthy meanderings ensure its failure."
3,Death is the End,"An interesting piece of fiction. Much like Rosemary's Baby Vanilla Sky uses the device of blurring reality and fantasy and exactly like Rosemary's Baby one single scene ushers in the beginning of pure fantasy. No one survives a dead stop auto crash at 80 mph; their internal organs would be ripped apart even if they were wearing a seat belt. From that point on all we have are Cruise's musings and suspicions as he dies. Monet's Vanilla Sky is an impressionistic expression of what that painter felt. The movie is the impressionistic expression of a character's deepest hopes and fears. Cruise's answer to the question, Do you believe in God?, is that all he sees is conspiracy and hopelessness - sad."
2,this movie takes 90 minutes to get started,"tom cruise doesnt even begin acting until 90 minutes into the movie. cameron crowe goes way overboard in trying to symbolize the plot thru rock n' roll songs. penelope cruz is beautiful! this movie was terrible thoough. an ending does NOT make a movie good. if u can stand the first 90 minutes, the last part of the movie is interesting. but i had to FORCE myself to keep with it and stay thru the first hour and a half. kurt russell is okay too. overall, lame mostly, solid in the end. eh."
1,don't go by the previews of this movie,"I saw the previews of this movie on Tv. It looked like it would be so good that I just bought it before renting. Big mistake. This is a boring, what is even going on movie."
2,dvd,bought this because it is one of the last movies showing the twin towers. I am not a Tom Cruise fan.
2,Descartes for the masses: a frozen dream,I suppose what I dislike about this movie is the misuse of cryonicstechnology as an asleep and dreaming scheme.To make an eternally young Tom Cruise sex film out of asci fi and philosophic concept seems obscene to me.The twist of insanity at the end of a very long set of reruns...I found it hard to watch this film which was obviously madefor big box office alone.I didn't like is very much.
1,Rob,"Tom Cruise needs to move to Australia where he will not be at risk from terrible America. The same America that gave that little dweeb everything he has. He is right up there with Jane Fonda and the Baldwin brothers. If you buy his movies, you are supporting his anti-american stance. Send a message, let his image fall from the screen into the dust."
2,dumb and slow,"I don't know why people liked this. to me it seemed like a long , dull, ad for tom cruise himself. his persona in the movie was so obnoxious that i WANTED things to go wrong for him. second, the drawn-out courtship - and- love scenes were hackneyed and long, and made me reach for the fast forward. There wase interminable footage of two naked torsos, shot from behind him. third, although the last part of the movie became more interesting, the ending was more of a cheat than a satisfying explanation. don't bother"
1,A Waste...,"Skip Vanilla Sky and rent Open Your Eyes (Abre Los Ojos). I don't know what Cameron Crowe was thinking when he decided to remake a recent, intelligent movie. Tom Cruise basically plays himself: a self-centered rich guy who sleeps with women and runs away when he's done with them, which gets him into trouble when Cameron Diaz ends up driving her car off a bridge with him in it. She's dead, he's disfigured. Penelope Cruz plays the woman who transforms Cruise into a ""good man"". Then all hell breaks loose, and the plot becomes insane and the film begins to try to hard to be cool and impress the viewer with bizarreness.It's almost obvious that Crowe used this movie as an excuse to put his favorite songs to film. He also uses so many pop-culture references in the finale that it's ridiculous. And the sci-fi ending, which actually makes sense in the original, is over the top and completely stupid in this movie."
2,NOT SUCH A BIG DEAL,"I am someone who appreciates movies. I enjoy all types of movies and give all movies a chance. In all honesty, I really tried with this movie. I thought the story was interesting and addicting, but the direction of the movie was very bad. It dragged way too much; an exageration in several scenes. Had this movie been directly differently, maybe it would have drew me closer, unfortunately, it failed to do just that.I don't recommend this movie to anyone at all. It is a complete waste of time."
1,The worst movie ever made,"I loved Jerry Maguire and when I heard the director and star were making another movie, I was first in line.I learned something watching this movie. Life is short and there are two hours of my life that I will never get back.This is the worst movie ever made. Bar none. The plot makes no sense, Tom Cruise is horribly disfigured so there's nothing to look at. I read another review that said the plot was full of holes. That's the beauty of this movie. You won't care! You won't spend time afterwards picking out plot holes, you will just not care AT ALL. Additional time thinking about this movie will just waste more time.Glitter was a better movie. Showgirls was a better movie. Seriously. Awful.P.S. You may be thinking I'm exagerating and try watching it yourself. Don't. Horrid. Awful."
2,STRANGE!????,"This movie was very hard to like the first time I watched it. But the more I watched it and understood it, I began to like it a little. The movie was too strange to enjoy fully.I wish I could return it and buy another DVD.This was just WHACK!"
1,"Interesting concept, sub par acting, awful editing/directing","VS was a huge disappointment. I kept waiting for something to happen. Cuts to the future (or was it the present time?) were so jumpy I thought the VCR tape was spliced. After 90 minutes, the only point in watching the rest was to figure out how everything was going to be tied together ... when it finally was I felt like the director was struggling to pull several disjointed plot lines together.Since Cruise & Cruz became romantically involved off the screen, I thought they would have had more chemisty on screen.Save your time & money for Minority Report."
2,Close your eyes....,"I certainly expected more from Cameron Crowe (although Almost Famous is commonly overrated). I especially enjoyed the opening credit ""written and directed for the screen by Cameron Crowe"". What??? It was already written for the screen (Open Your Eyes) and since he almost made a carbon copy of shots from the original, his directing wasn't much to brag about. His version comes across like N'Sync covering a Beatles tune. Do yourself a HUGE favor and see the original instead. Of course you will have to read subtitles (god forbid). The worst part of this ""cover"" movie is the ending. In the original you are left to figure somethings out on your own, in this one Cameron Crowe dumbs it down to a Scooby Doo ending where the antagonist tells you the whole story."
3,"""Weird"" is the adjective which comes to mind","Tom Cruise plays a wealthy, spoiled, self-indulgent man who has inherited his father's publishing firm. He is unconcerned with the feelings of others and lives only for himself. A spurned lover lures him into her car and takes a suicidal drive which results in severe facial disfigurement for him and rejection by his friends and business associates. At this point in the film, there is a constant juxtaposition between fantasy and reality and the viewer, as well as Cruise, seems unable to discern which is which. In an attempt to be ""deep"", the film makers have seemed only to succeed in being confusing, and a film that starts out promisingly degenerates to a sci-fi spiral at the end. This may be some people's cup of tea, but just be advised that this is no romantic comedy!"
3,Just a little confusing,"even though cameron crowe is a genius, this film was a little on the confusing side . yes, it explains it all in the end,but he really could have done better. I give the acting 100%, Tom Cruise is phenominal(if anybody else played this role, this movie would have [stunk].) Last it's god to see Kurt Russell back on the big screen."
2,What's the point?,"I am a huge Tom Cruise fan, but I must be honest. I did not enjoy Vanilla Sky. The story line flip flopped between dream, therapy and reality...which left me quite confused until the very end. Curiosity is what kept me hangin on...wanting to know what's the point? At any rate Cruise plays David, a handsome and rich womanizer. His womanizing gets him into serious life altering situations. The only thing that stayed on my mind from this movie was the statement that his sex buddy (who was really in love by herself) made, ""When you sleep with someone your body makes a promise whether you do or not!"""
1,Confusing,"This movie emphasizes the shallowness of people - Tom Cruise's character and his friends are self-absorbed yuppies. If you are not young, good looking and rich, you are pathetic. Nothing in the second half of the movie made sense. David Aames' face is disfigured, then reconstructed - after which he keeps his mask on - was it because the ugliness within reflected on the outside and was too much for him to face? Ending was a disappointment. Made less sense than the whole movie!"
1,"Tried to Watch it Twice, Both Times I fell Asleep","When this was originally released in the theaters, I was quite intrigued to see what Cameron Crowe had put together and how Tom Cruise would deliver. I must say that I am happy that I didn't go and see it at the theater. BORING!!!!!!!!!! I have tried my darndest to get all the way through this movie but I have fallen asleep each time before I even got halfway through it. One day I will probably TRY and give this one another run. I really do want to see how it all ""comes together."" Prior to doing this I will need to stock up on a case load of Stay Awakes, 10 pots of coffee and toothpicks for the eyes (ala Fred Flintstone); all of this AFTER I have slept for 72 solid hours."
1,A steaming pile of...,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The audience was laughing, it was so bad. The only refreshing moment was when Cameron Diaz's pathetic character says, ""I swallowed your ... That means something!"" -- the best laugh of the entire movie."
2,Tries too hard to be artistic,"It wasn't that I didn't understand what was going on, it was that it was simply too much work to follow. Part of the joy of watching a film, as opposed to reading a novel, is that the very act of trying to tell a complicated story in 2 or 3 hours in the medium of movie making compels the storyteller to get to the point. When a film tries to hard to be an artistic statement, it ends up being just that, a statement. I don't watch films for statements, I want to be entertained.I'm not saying this movie isn't an ok rental, but I'd hardly recommend buying it to watch over again, it was way too slow in my opinion to watch again, especially considering once you know the twists, there's nothing there to surprise you anymore.I did enjoy watching Cruz, she has a powerful on screen presence, and although I like Diaz a lot too, this wasn't the best role for her in my opinion. Cruise has the ability to make really great films but this one isn't one of them."
4,It took me three watches,"I just watched this again; it's not even a week since Katie left Tom and this film offers an extraordinary example of Cruise rising to the challenge of portraying masculine vulnerability. He is a very good actor and I'll always love his performance in ""Born On the Fourth of July.""Vanilla Sky is a trip deep inside the mind of a suave, narcissistic, extremely rich and extremely handsome guy fantasizing about the perfect love that could have been-- that fantasy in itself is one of the symptoms of his self-destructive narcissism. Cruise's ability to be ugly on various levels was gut-wrenching in this movie: he is very raw and very exposed. I think this film improves upon more than one viewing because it is so complex of a plot which delves deep into the subconscious mind of the protagonist. It's a puzzle that the viewer must piece together in order to know who this guy really is. I liked it a lot on the third view and my hat's off to Crowe and to Cruise the actor."
4,Original concept with meaningful personal implications.,"Although this movie seems to draw much debate and controversy whether a person ""liked"" it or not. I thought it a good movie; memorable in fact. If you still haven't watched it, do so. Then you will know why my review is so short.Basically Cruise in this one is trying to find out what bleep is going on, and you are just as helpless as he is. Consider it a part mystery, part psycho-drama. The ending will leave you wondering what you would choose..."
2,Dang ! This film is bad!,"This film is ridiculous! Poorly acted with a plot that doesn't hang together. However, it's one of those film that's sort of memorable for its badness. For over a decade my friends and I have been shouting, ""Tech support! Tech support!"" whenever life throws a curve ball. So far no one has been visited by a geeky IT angel, but you never know!"
4,One of Those Movies I Liked - but Will Need to Watch Again,"Am not sure I will ever fully appreciate this film's artistic ambitions, but I did find the movie interesting and compelling enough that I will someday re-watch it. Movie was a bit on the long side - think the same story could have been told in less than 2 hours without losing anything substantive. Tom Cruise was excellent - as ""Tom Cruise""."
4,Sci-fi with out much sci.,"I don't see why so many people despise this film. It's complicated, well-written, and smart. The mainstream music choices add just enough to the surreal world where this movie takes place, and the too-perfect sky is gorgeous. Vanilla Sky is maybe too complex and challenging for most people, but that makes me like it all the more. Reminds me of Memento, 12 Monkeys, but with a lighter heart, and based on hope.I would be sad, too, if I were one of the reviewers who hated Vanilla Sky."
1,Worst movie ever,You will never be able to get this time back. Watching this movie is wasting your life. Tom Cruise is a bad actor and the whole concept of the movie is stupid.
2,It was just horrible,"Unless you like hair-dos for hair-do sake, this is a really pointless movie. The character is stupid, the story is stupid, not even slightly dramatic."
2,Subpar remake of a subpar rip-off of a subpar movie.,"The concept is the same as total recall. Vanilla sky had potential, but the viewers hand is held in the end ,like we are retards, and everything is explained in one scene. I did enjoy this movie at one point, but when the entire idea is relayed in the end, it became stupid. Better than alot of Tom Cruise garbage, but not good overall."
4,Tom in Trouble,"This movie is one of deep psychological thought, hard to follow and put the pieces together, depressing and sad. That's why no one went to see this gem. BUT seeing it again and maybe again is how you realize what a great story and movie this is. That's why I had to buy this DVD."
3,Confusing...but worth it!!!!!,"Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz shine in this movie!! Although the plot is a bit confusing, you'll find yourself caring about these people. Definetly have an open mind before sitting yourself in front of the TV...the movie shifts back and forth. You don't know what's real and what's a dream. Watch out for the scene in Times Square, the music and the surprise ending. It'll make you think real hard about life and the choices you make. ""Everyday's a chance to turn it all around."""
3,"Great film , But?","Although this film was not a critical success ... It's great..Yes... It pales in comparation to the original , But what more can you expect a Hollywood production?This is one of the best edited films I've ever seen...I know that the editing's not that important...But this editing is amazing...I would have given 4 stars to this great film... But the dvd doesn' t have the deleted scenes!!!!the original movie has a great violent scene at the end of the movie... But it was erased because suposibly it was inapropiate...But thats what the dvd's for!!!!savages"
2,"Rent, don't buy","The movie was a complete waste...waste of time, money and talent. For about half of the film I really enjoyed it, and then I began questioning why I spent any money on it. If you're determined to watch this movie, rent it first."
3,Not CRAZY enough about this MOVIE to watch it twice.,"Immediately after watching this movie on DVD...I threw up...so to speak. Afterwards I started exploring the special features and learned a few insights from the short films included on the DVD. It was enough to get me to start to watch the movie again with the director's (Cameron Crowe)commentary. Then I thought that's a little crazy since it made me throw up after the first time. However, listening to the commentary one learns that the movie is full of ""clues"" and while you might pick these out of the movie it is still difficult to determine their significance. While the movie might appear to be cleverly choreographed it is actually open to the viewers individual interpretation.After digesting the movie, I liked it a little more."
2,"Ladies and Gentlemen...welcome to the ""Twlight Zone""...","""Vanilla Sky"" could've been a LOT better if Mr. Cameron Crowe would've done four things: Give it spice (I had to sing the ""boring song"" towards the mid-end of the movie!) made its time length shorter, and cast out Penelope Cruz. The poor girl can not speak English-or even act.""Vanilla Sky"" is so ""bizarre"". It sticks in too many elements at the same time. It leaves you wondering, and confused. Everything is so...bizarro. Though I have to admit, Mr. Crowe is very darn creative, and has a vivid imagination. It's a movie that's hard to understand while you watch it, but don't understand anything until the end. At the end it'll make you say, ""Oh...I get it now! Okay...uh, whatever"". ""The Sixith Sense"" is a prefect example of a very good ""bizzare"" movie. ""Vanilla Sky"" hits you with so many things...sigh. If only I'd have gotten my money to try out Coca Cola's new ""Vanilla Coke"". Must be sweeter..."
2,Boring Movie,"I found Vanilla Sky to be boring. The theme and storyline is very weak. It cannot be compared to Jerry Maguire which is a really good movie. The only good thing about this movie is the actors(Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz). If your a fan of these actors watch it for that reason, if not skip it."
2,"Not Too Poorly Done, But Depressing And ""Out There.""","I can't say the movie is too poorly directed. Nor can I say that the acting is terrible.However, the movie just seems to loose track of itself in some way. It increasingly becomes just kind of ""out there."" Meanwhile, the movie's depressing vibe and cumbersome storyline serve to simultaneously confuse you and bum you out.And, yeah, Tom Cruise is in it. Enough said."
2,just not my cup of tea,"This is a perfect example of a movie you either love or hate. I personally dislike it with a passion. This is probably a movie that gets better and you understand it better the more times you watch. The thing is that it's just not interesting enough for me find out what ""really"" happend. While Memento was twice as confusing, it was four times better.I gave it two stars only for the fact that Penelope Cruz is gorgeous in this movie."
1,Unbelievably awful!,"Ever watch a movie and you are completely dumbfounded, mouth hanging open? This is it.I didn't have high hopes for this film, and I have to say it was far worse than I thought it would be.This is one of the weakest performances of Tom Cruise that I have ever seen. It was like all the actors in this film were completely uncomfortable in their roles, and on the set. Total fakeness. It doesn't help that the dialogue is cheesy, [stuff].The story is the most confusing aspect of the film, with flash-forwards, flash-backs, dream sequences, etc. that you just simply can not follow. Likewise, the twist at the end, if it is a twist, is mind boggling.You would expect a Cameron Crowe film to have great music? Not this one. Score (by Nancy Wilson) was very sappy, and the other music cues felt totally un-original, un-exciting and un-cool.I hate to say it, but this film is a total piece of [stuff] - worst movie I have seen in recent memory (along with Tim Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"")."
1,VANILLA SKY IS TOM CRUISE'S WORST MOVIE!!!,"VANILLA SKY IS TOM CRUISE'S WORST MOVIE!!! It looks and sounds like an old 33 1/3 record being played backwards and forwards on an old record player!!! Cruise must have made this movie with Penelope Cruz to get back at Nicole Kidman. I was very disappointed when I left the theater after the end of this movie--""I paid for that???""--but I will say that Cruise has now more than made up for this clunker with MINORITY REPORT!!!"
1,Horrendous Nonsense.,"I'm usually very open-minded and like bizarre, challenging things as much as the next guy, but only when it's well done. I saw this tripe it's opening weekend with my sister and 8 year old nephew Jean' and he summed it up perfectly when he began crying and shrieked..""I don't know what this is!"" I couldn't have put it better myself. We walked out, and you should too.A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME."
3,It wasn't THAT bad.,"Okay, maybe it wasn't GREAT, or AWESOME.But it wasn't horrible.In my opinion, yes, this movie COULD have been better. But its pretty good the way it is. It does make you think. And just because it doesn't have action or a very simple plot, doesn't make it a horrible movie.I can't really see how anyone could give it the bad reviews that it recieved, but on some level, maybe.I liked it, lets just put it that way.At least watch it once."
2,Remember the soap opera Dallas?,"Cameron Crowe (Jerry Maguire/Almost Famous/Say Anything)is a fine writer/director and Tom Cruise is a decent actor (Magnolia/Rain Man/Jerry Maguire). Cameron Diaz (Very Bad Things/ The Last Supper/ Being John Malkovich) and Penelope Cruz (Blow/ Abre Los Ojos) are also good actress, as well as being very easy on the eye. However, Vanilla Sky is probably the lowest point of all their careers.To put Vanilla Sky into perspective: Does anyone remember when Dallas was the most popular programme on TV and then Patrick Duffy left and it wasn't? Problem was they'd killed off his charachter Bobby Ewing and so had to come up with a ludicrous twist to bring him back. What was that ludicrous plot twist? It was all a dream. Don't want to be a plot spoiler for those of you that have been fortunate not to have seen Vanilla Sky but that's the twist. Yes, apart from the first 45 minutes or so of this dissapointing movie its all a dream. Sorry but I wasn't impressed."
5,Wow.,"It is shocking how ridiculously stupid some people are.If you are a simple minded cow and you don't ""get it"" then obviously you aren't going to like the film.If you want to whinge about the fact that you didn't like the ending, just get over it. Why is it such a big deal that the ending wasn't what you expected? Not EVERY SINGLE MOVIE has to be a paint by number detective hobby kit for you to figure out. It isn't a race to see if you can guess what's going on before the film ends.If you want something like that, watch a Michael Bay movie. That would be more suited to your intellect.And for the complete tool that asked what the title means, read an art history book, muppet."
2,What a waste of time,Vanilla Sky has glamourous actors doing glamourous things but in the end none of it matters. You'll feel like you wasted 2 hours investing in the lives of the characters in this movie because in the end you will find you have invested in nothing. A good twist to a movie validates all that comes before it. The twist in this movie only proves what a waste the entire movie is.
1,"No, Cruise, no! Please, don't ruin a beautiful movie!","Oh, Cruise... Why did you have to go and remake Abre Los Ojos? If you liked the original so much, why didn't you let it be...It was so much better...The only thing I liked about the whole movie was Cameron Diaz's line, 'Even if you don't, your body makes a promise!'Rewriting of the screen play was, as everybody agrees, horrible. All the things that made Abre Los Ojos work have gone missing. Why turn Cruise into a millionaire? Why make him run down Times Square? Why, why, why for a thousand of things.There's not much to talk about, because there's not much to be salvaged. Pretty much everything was wrong. I didn't read a single review before I bought the DVD and now I'm sorry. I'll got ditch it to somebody who hasn't heart about it, oh well."
1,Vanilla Sky,I dont beleive that this movie deserves any stars! I find it very hard to beleive that it received any stars. Trulley the worst movie I have ever seen!
1,vanilla sky,"All I can say about Vanilla Sky is that if you get the urge to buy or rent this film, beat yourself in the head with a 2X4 instead--it's a lot quicker and less painful than watching this film."
1,Pure waste of time,"With a couple of friends I went out to watch a movie. Unfortunately we decided on ""Vanilla Sky"". Well, I have to admit that the first 50 or 60 minutes of the film were quite good, but from there on it went downhill with terrifying speed. And finally... EVERYONE of us started to laugh out loud about the ""highly dramatic ending"". We got out of the cinema and into a bar and shrugged our shoulders about two hours stupidity. And that was that."
1,Previews make you want to see it,"This is one of the movies where you watch the preview and you say, 'wow that movie looks awesome'. Infact this movie was horrible. I couldn't find a plot in it. They just folllowed David Ames, Tom Cruise's, life though the whole movie. It seemed like he was on drugs for the second half. This is definitly a horrible movie. The ending for this was definitly horrible."
4,Love it or hate it,"Interesting idea, nice look and an uncomfortable feel make this movie what it is."
2,Wasn't a complete waste of time - I dozed off for 15 minutes,"This movie drags on and on. I felt no emphathy with the characters and simply didn't care what happens to them. Obvious clues about the ""surprise"" ending were blared out in your face throughout the movie. I dozed off during the movie, and only woke up to see if my guess for the ending was correct. The only good thing about this movie was Cameron Diaz' very believable performance."
4,Abres Les Ojos,"I would recommend Abres Les Ojos over Vanilla Sky. Penelope Cruz give great performances in both of these films. However, Cameron Crowe did not change much from the original. That said, this movie is still good. One of those reality questioning movies that takes a few good twists and turns that will leave you either confused or thinking you have an explanation, but nobody knows for sure. That was the original intent, not to answer anything. This is a solid title with good performances from the entire cast, including two of my favorites, Jason Lee and Penelope Cruz. Worth checking out."
2,A stunning pretentious bunch of nonsense,"How this can be considered a masterpiece is beyond me. Maybe by a 16 year old on acid. But otherwise, it's pretentious mess whose concepts were stolen from much better movies, like Jacob's Ladder.Also ruined of course by the most overrated actor I can think of - Tom Cruise. Please someone tell me why you like him. I mean as an ACTOR, not just a pretty (to some women and gay men) face. I could act better and I've never acted. Every time he says something, it's as if he is reading a script. I wonder if they have a monitor with the words on it for him. He's like a karaoke actor!I'll give it two stars though just for the sake of the other actors in the film who had the bad luck to have to play across from Cruise in this silly nonsensical piece of wannabe profundity."
5,Mesmerizing!,"I heard mixed reviews before sitting down to watch the film. I was expecting an average movie with decent acting. Could I have been any more wrong? The acting is great especially from Tom Cruise and Jason Lee. Cameron Diaz makes an impression as well as Penelope Cruz in their roles. The plot is mind-blowing with more plot twists than I have ever seen. The movie starts off a little slow, but then picks up and never lets go. The end is great, and I loved how this made you think. Great movie."
2,Tommy Boy Goes For the Gold,"I like Tom Cruise. But lately, he's kicked into movie overdrive.""Vanilla Sky,"" an entertaining, somewhat clunky drama, offers Tom Terrific the chance to play a vain, super-rich New Yorker who emerges from a near-fatal car crash with a hideously disfigured face. Poor, poor Tom.The film does manage to hold your interest (Tom loves to ACT for all of us) but only because it is part Hitchcockian allegory, part sc-fi, part psychodrama and part let's see if Tom Terrific could snag an Oscar nomination. Halfway through, it falls apart, but picks itself once once the filmmakers tells what's real, possibly isn't. Dozens of other actors could have played this role, but Tom managed to get it first. That's not a bad thing, but not a good thing either."
2,The original was better,"I gave it only two starts because I don't like the remake as much as I enjoyed the original movie.This movie is a remake of ""Open Your Eyes"" (same leading actress in both movies), originally in Spanish, but believe it or not, the Spanish version was more enjoyable and more understandable (in spite of the subtitles).Good only for Sci-Fi fans and the rest of you won't really enjoy it or understand what went on."
1,Imitation Vanilla leave a bad taste,"This movies dragged on and on. By the time I was two thirds of the way through the movie I didn't care anymore. Oh Tom Cruise was an insensitive butthead and ended up scarred for life, boo-frickin'-hoo. He did have a cool alarm clock though."
1,A REALLY BAD DREAM!,"I don't usually write movie reviews, but this was a huge disappointment. I still can't figure out what the movie was about. I think Tom Cruise must have a twisted side to him to do movies like this and Eyes Wide Shut. And, hey Cameron Crowe- How about a movie that actually makes sense for a change? By the time it was all over, I was sorry I wasted the time watching it.Do not spend good money on this .... If you must see- get it from the library as I did- FOR FREE."
1,Not even worth one star!,"Even though this movie had it's moments...this movie isn't worth renting/buying. I thought since Tom Cruise was in it, it was going to be great becuz every film Tom is in it's always a success. But I thought wrong. This movie was very strange and missleading and just not even worth my time. I didn't like the ending and some of the scenes. This movie is not worth your money. Instead go rent/buy Tom's Mission Impossible 2. That movie is excellent and will leave you satisfied."
2,An ending would have been nice.,"I'm still not sure why I watched this. I despise Tom Cruise, and Penelope Cruz needs to learn to speak better english. But I sat through it. I actually found myself interested. I like to be suprised, somewhat confused at times while watching movies. It means its not something I've seen before. Its something that hollywood rarely does these days, put out something new.But this movie lacked a solid ending. Its almost as if they wrote this film without an ending in mind and they just made one up. The film had me wondering ""what in the heck is going on?"" I really wasn't sure wether or not Cruise was insane or not at one point. But then to find out what was going on, I was severly disappointed. Had the ending been better I would have gave more stars, but keeping me interested for part of the movie only gets part of the stars."
1,Pretentious Horrific Script Insults the Actors and Audience,"This morality tale about a spoiled rich young man who has lost his soul does not have one good scene in it. Why? Because the director and the screenwriters try to tell us, rather than show us, about the dangers of excess wealth with no accountability. As a result, we must suffer a series of cliches, while the director lectures us about morality. Because the script is so abysmal, the actors overact. The scenes have a static quality about them that reminds me of B movies I used to watch in the early seventies. Plot? So convuluted that you need Vanilla Sky Cliff Notes on your lap while watching the film. Because of the grand, aspirations of this movie, it must be truly one of the most egregious film failures in the last five years or so."
2,Why must Hollywood bother?,"Bizarre and completely unappealing remake of the French film (that also stars Penelope Cruz) about handsome publishing executive Cruise who becomes disfigured in a car crash caused by jealous lover Diaz after he starts seeing a new girl down the street (Cruz). One may find the first twenty minutes of this tasteless black comedy intriguing, but Cruise's decent into hell is just so hollow and bitter that the audience will feel that they have been personally assaulted just as much as him. Visually unexciting with nothing to recommend it what so ever."
2,Tech Support!!!!,"This film began really well, with a sinister atmosphere, eye-popping panoramic cityscapes and compelling story. What a shame then that what could have been a powerful study of psychosis in the tradition of David Lynch' films, became a pretentious and silly variation of `Tron'.Really, by then end of this bad sci-fi/melodrama I didn't care less about Cruise's vein popping, narcissistic character (who is bizarrely prone to sudden fits of bad breakdancing). Kurt Russell's character makes no sense whatsoever, the final scenes are ridiculous, and the `twist' ending a total copout.Scores points, however, for a murder scene that features ""what if god was one of us""."
1,Two Thumbs Down,"Sad to see all that talent on screen have to try and make a bad script good. If you seen the movie ""Fatal Attraction"" you will have gotten the idea of what the movie is about, and tie in at the end the movie the ""Usual Suspect"" and Kablam you have Vanilla Sky. People might think this is cool, but it was simply ridiculous. The movie has no originality, and is not thought provoking at all, unless one hasn't given thought to marketing scams damaging a person's life."
1,A total fruitless film,"Well, first of all I can understand all those people to find interesting this movie without haven't seen the Amenabar masterpiece but I can't close my mouth and ""close my eyes"".I had very excited to see this film and give it a try without compare it to Abre los ojos (Open your eyes) spanish original film, but is impossible to achieve.All the magic, mistery, consistency, stellar playings, soul and many merits have thrown away to the W.C in the american remake. Bored and with a offensive different and simple script for idiots or children, nothing to see with the far better original.Frightful Cruise, ludicrous Diaz and go on. Even my compatriot Penelope Cruz has lost her bright in this remake.What a disastrous way to destroy a beautiful chance.Give yourself a favour and see the original and then think about this Disney farce. 1 over 10. A real pain."
1,Can't ever get those 2 hours back,"This was clearly one of the worst films ever made. Whenever my wife suggests I have made a error in judgment (daily), I reminder that she insisted that we go watch this movie."
2,Watch Abre los Ojos instead,"To preface this: maybe if I hadn't seen Abre los Ojos first, I would feel differently. I feel that the remake didn't add anything to the original, and was just a way to showcase Tom Cruise trying desperately once again to be a serious actor. Unless you absolutely can't under any circumstances stand subtitles, watch the original."
3,Meh,"Vanilla Sky is an interesting remake of Abre los ojos. I can't say that it's better though.Tom cruise's acting is meh. Cameron Diaz is Meh. Penelope cruz did her role better in the original.Overall the film seems to work better than the original in the music department. The scene where tom leaves penelope's apartment right before the car accident and you hear jeff buckley's last goodbye is simply irresistible!Also the scene when tom walks into the club and you see people dancing to thievery corporation's Indra track is very cool.And at the end when you hear Sigur ros is just unforgettable!Other than that, the film is inferior to the original.Perhaps it being set in NYC made it more appealing but whatever."
2,Well maybe 2 1/2 stars?!?!?!,"Tom's acting was a little better in this film but seriously folks the most he really has going for him is that he is an exceptional good lookin man. He keeps getting more and more handsome as he ages. Now here is the but,,,,,I really think he has the potential to be a really good actor but the roles he has been taking just don't do anything for him anymore. Sometimes while i was watching this movie i was wondering what he would look like as a drag queen. If anything, that would have spiced up this film alot. Otherwise outside a few scenes here and there this film is boring.Now his co-star,,,,what was her name? again was BORING. Was this her first attempt at making a movie? I don't believe i ever saw her act on Broadway. Oh, that's right, Broadway is for real actors.Tom,,,,if you read this,,,you can do better buddy."
1,Hello?!?!?!?,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. It seems like the writer couldn't come up with a good explanation for the plot he created, so he decided to go with the most far-fetched and unrealistic ending. Please don't compare this film to ""The Sixth Sense"". It's NOWHERE near as good."
1,The worst movie I've ever seen...,"This is it. Since my wife is such a Tom Cruise Fan, we decided to give this flick a try. We were greatly disappointed. Tom Cruise wasn't even up to his usual high standards. Cameron Diaz was superb as always, but Penelope Cruz has to be one of the worst actresses to ever walk on the face of the planet. Combine her lack of skill with a lousy story idea about a horribly disfigured man trying to come to terms with his own mortality, and you get this...the worst movie I've ever seen."
1,Don't waste your time,I am a huge Tom Cruise fan but this movie was awful. I hated it. Stupid story - terrible ending.
2,CONVOLUTED MESS!,"The ultimate tease and let down. The first hour and a half was pretty engaging and interesting and then the film imploded in sci-fi nonsense. Was this Cameron's homage film to Brazil (a much much better film)? If so, he fails miserably. Better luck next time Cameron!"
3,Good acting...mediocre story,"The acting in this movie is rock solid all around...Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz, et al do a very solid job...Problem: The script and storyline turned out to be very very weak. What started off as intriguing turned out to be monotonous and boring and ridiculous...and it seemed to go on and on and on and on and on and on...the first 45 minutes or so are excellent, but after that...no thanks"
1,Couldn't make it through the whole thing.,Couldn't make it through the whole thing. I felt it was good in the beginning but left me feeling more empty and unfulfilled as it went on. Finally I skipped to the end and was glad that I did. The ending was just as lame as the middle. The movie seemed 6 hours longer than it actually is.
5,so far the best remake I've seen,"People's blaming cameron crowe do nothing else to the story but exactly what was in the original and so it destroy the originity of the orginal... First of all, this is a remake, so that would make a perfect sense why their story are the same.., the second thing about destroying originity, I rather think the saturation of this version is positively working on me. This version is more colorful than the original in a working way. I watched it so many times by now and still I know some time later I'll rewatch it again, its more like fairy tale story in a twisted way, where people yell for a second chance on certain things."
3,Why bother with the remake?,"First off, let me say that I did not think the film was as bad as the critics made out. My main objection to it was the fact that it was identical to the original Spanish movie. Crowe does a grand job with the style and direction of the movie. What lets the movie down is the performances of Cruise and Cruz. .... Compared to the performance of the actor in the original, he comes off second best. ...On the plus side, Diaz and Russell give solid performances. ...Look out for the line that Diaz delivers just before she crashes the car when telling Mr Cruise just how much she loves him .... it is guaranteed to get every males attention.The original movie is a classic. This movie is above average. I just think that Crowe, Cruise and Co. would have been far better off in concentrating their talents on something original.Well worth a watch. Open your wallets."
2,Tired Idea All Dressed Up In New Clothes,"Imagine a very old and over used idea that's been done yet again - but with the most up to date film making techniques. I must admit I was absolutely hooked right up to the finish. However, I was so disappointed with the finish, it caused me to give this flick only two stars!Tom Cruise is, as always, magnificent."
1,Great music!,"Well you can't hit a home run every day. I expected Tom Cruise, with his intensely insincere smile to be the worst thing in this movie but he's fine.Nonetheless its very long, very slow, hard to follow, wildly implausible and pointless. Love the soundtrack, though."
5,OPEN YOUR EYES....,"First saw this on the plane and then watched it two more times to let it sink in. I don't often go for romantic thrillers but I've been converted - I loved Cruz's character from the start, not just beautiful but honest, generous and genuinely caring - really touching. Cruise on the other hand is making a real break from the adolescent parts he normally plays and carries the performance well. The story is original (something desperately lacking these days) and some might say far fetched but is a great backdrop for exploring the whole theme of LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriendshipSex...Movie rental is peanuts these days and you're going to die soon so what the hell are you all umming and ahhing about?!"
4,Open Your Eyes to the Symbolism,"This film was full of symbolism. You had to watch it that way to ""get it.""This film brought so many questions to the surface. Do you need money to be happy? Who is the real you? Is it the one face you show to others or is the one face you see of yourself? If you had a second chance, how would you live your life?Vanilla sky is a movie that makes you think. You must watch it carefully to catch the nuances of each character's attitudes and reactions. Cruise pushes the envelope from happy oblivion to paranoia. Diaz's psychotic stalker scared me with her realism. Cruz played her part as a ""prop"" well. This film didn't do her justice. The surprise character was Kurt Russell. Quite a change from his usual characters.Open your eyes. Watch for the symbolism. You may need to see this movie more than once to understand it."
2,Vanilla is an apt description....,"This is not a film that posesses the ability to rise your interest above that of vanilla.While a cinematographer's dream, the story of a self-indulgent man facing the reprecussions of his choices, just kind of lies there. The casting was promising, but the story kills any of their efforts. It just didn't seem to have the 'punch' one would expect, given the premise and the setting. Also, the trailors really set you up for a greater expectation than you come close to getting.The end also seems to be one of those story-telling devices in the category of 'Oh no! We need to tie this all together and we've got 5 minutes to do it.' I felt strongly that the ending was just thrown together and not actually a strong part of any part of the story.If you're a Tom Cruise fan, you get plenty of Tom. But if you're a fan of good storytelling...I suggest steering clear of this."
5,"Amazing, unsettling, upsetting...","Cameron Crowe was known for sweet natured films, so seeing ""Vanilla Sky"" was a refreshing escape from his norm. Strange and compelling, it's about a guy who's privileged and set in his ways. Suddenly, things change and he doesn't know what's going on. I didn't really know what was going on either, but it was too compelling to take my eyes away. The catharsis at the end was worth the wait. Fine acting from all, especially Cruise and Jason Lee. Cameron Diaz was deservedly nominated for many awards (SAG, etc), and I take issue with Penelope Cruz' nom from the Razzies. She was charming and totally in touch with the material.The DVD has loads of extras; the story makes sense if you can make it through the middle section, which goes off in many directions. This is an American remake of an Amenabar film, in which Ms Cruz appeared. Critics are wrong, on so many levels. It's definitely worth a look."
1,PURE GARBAGE,AFTER SEEING THIS MOVIE YOU'LL BE LIKE OH NO!WHAT WERE ON THESE PEOPLE'S MINDS WHEN THEY DECIDED TO MAKE THIS FILM.ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS I RENTED THE DVD EXPECTING TO SEE SOME GOOD ACTING.INSTEAD I RECIEVED THE BIGGEST RIPOFF OF 2002.
1,hmmmmm......,"I went in to this movie with high expectations, but in the end, I was left dissappointed. The plot just moves around and the ending just seemed to ruin the film."
2,What Was I Thinking?,"I watched this movie last evening and I have to say that I have never seen weird, confusing movie since 12 Monkies. I'm still confused.The plot is pathetic and mindlessly confusing, it's all about lucid dreams and Tom Cruise seeing how many times he can flick his hair in a minute while the cameras on him. The film is basically all a blur from start to finish, it's a dreadful mix of sci-fi nonsense and obvious fake romance. Why on earth would someone want to remake a foreign film with this kind of plot anyway. Don't buy this film on DVD or you'll be wasting your money. I'm sorry if you've found this review uninformative, but since Vanilla Sky is really about nothing whatsoever it's very hard to go into much detail."
1,Waste of time Waste of money,this movie was a complete waste of time and money and Tom Cruise was discraced who is usually in good movies that's why I watched it but it was horrible and unfollowable
1,Do not watch,"Vanilla sky??? More like chocolate crap! I'll make this review short and to the point. This movie was for Hollywood bigheads to show off their ego. It lacks heart, depth, or meaning. Don't buy it, don't watch it. Unless your life's a pile of crap."
3,Did You Even Watch The Movie?,"Sorry folks, but to all the the reviews that said they did not know what was going on, I must ask the above question. This was different than the average movie (think 12 Monkeys) but was a pretty decent movie in the end. It's like Sixth Sense, it all flows/jives/makes sense as the end is winding down. For anyone who reads the reviews that say it was bad, I hope you have an open mind and give it a chance. It wasn't that bad."
2,Up in the Clouds?,"I enjoyed the first hour of this movie at the theater. Then the plot twisted into ""What Dreams May Come"" artificial cartoon like fantasy and made me lose interest all together. The director literally destroyed a potentially good movie. The sick and twisted love triangle could have worked with controversial plot twists or an ironic ending focusing on Tom Cruise's regretful decisions. The director's option of turning the last part of the movie into science fiction completely blew it!!!!! It's unfortunate because this film was very interesting until it started to get very unrealistic with futuristic technologies that have absolutely nothing to do with the love/suspense scenes. I enjoyed the characters; Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, and Penelope Cruz, but was disgusted on the decision making of the writers and director of the ending of this movie."
3,I enjoyed this,"If you liked ""The Game"" with Michael Douglas, you will probably enjoy this one. I know I gave it 3 stars 3.5 to be exact, that is only because seeing it once is enough. Yet I enjoyed this movie because it was so different and bizarre...it really makes you think. It has alot of strange twists and strange humor. It keeps you addicted enough as you try to figure out what in the world is going on. Thankfully all is explained towards the end of the movie. It is worth seeing, some may not get it and some may. I think I did. It sure beats ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (although that wouldn't take much!) Tom Cruise did a good job with this one."
3,Slow,Very average movie ... Very slow moving...didn't make it to the end. Plot seemed very thin. Life turned very bad for a narcissist.
5,review,Great movie love it something I can watch over and over again and still gind out something new about it tom does this movie justice.
2,Terrible Ending,"I was absolutely in love with this movie for the first 3 quarters. I thought that I would have to realign my list of best movies ever. I was really confused as to how they would end it, but didn't expext what they did. THEY RUINED IT. So anyway, the ending is way to far out and just not done well in my opinion. I wish someone else could produce a better ending for this film so I could enjoy the entirety of it."
1,"Two hours of dreck, absolute dreck","This is probably the worst movie, the most boring one I've ever seen. Ever.The ghastly thing repeats and repeats, the dog frozen, ""what is your happiness?"" Boring.Tommy Cruise just stands around with that ... grin, showing his teeth.This could have been told in a 15 minute episode of The Twilight Zone, and it still would have seemed like 45 minutes.The title is all wrong. ""Life is an illusion, a dream"" is more fitting. Wanna life forever? Not like this."
4,&#65533;The Game&#65533; & &#65533;Fight Club&#65533;,"Rule number one: ""Watch this movie once and for all."" Because if you did not concentrate in the first time you watch it you won't understand it and you'll ruin the movie for youself!This movie reminded me of both ""The Game"" & ""Fight Club"". The story goes too far beyond reality to an extent that you get DISTURBED! But the end manages to pull all the threads back together!The problem with this type of movies is that if you do not accept ""swallow"" the ending, you'll never like the movie... but I swallowed it & I liked it!Both Cruise & Cruz did a GREAT job... personally I think one of the best ""ACTING"" jobs for Tom Cruise is this movie! ..."
2,convoluted borefest,"this movie is unbelievably convoluted, torturously long and mindbendingly boring. it gave me a headache. and what does it all mean? who cares. it's no wonder this movie flopped at the box office. it's torture to sit through."
3,Journey,"I wasn't happy with this CD, I guess I expected something wonderful from the author and this was a disappointment."
1,"Sad, bizarre, pointless movie.","Spotted this at a video store and thought it would be good due to the description on the back...wrong! I could barely sit through it. I can't imagine why Mary Stuart Masterson would star in something like this...she must have been desperate for work! I love her acting but I'd rather watch her in Immediate Family, Bed of Roses, or Fried Green Tomatoes. If you're looking for something to make you want to go jump off a cliff, go ahead and rent this movie, if you're looking for something entertaining and uplifting, look elsewhere."
3,"great story, lousy typsetting","I have always enjoyed any book by Grace Livingston Hill; been reading them since I was a girl. It always amused me at the Depression-era descriptions (five-cent crackers, a dime for carfare) but did remind me that things used to be that way. I have this book in paperback, very worn.I was excited to order it for my Kindle. Only the love of the material is what gives this review the 3 stars. This edition is riddled with typos to the point that it is almost an effort to read it. Only my knowledge of how it is supposed to read (from numerous readings)kept me from deleting it from the Kindle. I would recommend that whoever is responsible for setting this up in Kindle format learn to type, or whatever.....the book deserves a better format than it is in now."
5,Another Sweet Grace Livingston Book,This is another sweet Grace Livingston book. Turn of the last century/ pre world war one era Grace's books all have a sweet christian message wrapped up in them.
3,Good but unrealistic,"I like GLH; however, this book does not seem to be realistic. Rich young men do not fall so easily & fast for commoners."
5,One of her BEST!!,"Yes, if you like GLH books, you will love 'The Enchanted Barn'. It is a true page turner and you won't want to put it down!! Love it...love it ....love it....... You won't regret purchasing this book. I collect GLH books and am a huge fan --- can't you tell???? lol"
1,The Enchanted Barn,This book contained a lot of typographical errors which detracted from the enjoyability of reading.
3,good read,"I enjoyed reading this book, it kept you activelly wanting to know what will happen next. The kind of book you start on a Sunday afternoon"
1,Don't buy from this supplier!,"This is not a true copyrighted version of The Enchanted Barn. It is scanned and copied. There are many, many missing pages and the last several pages of the book are not included!!! How does it end? If you care, don't buy from this supplier.Absolutely appalling that this lousy copy would make its way to Amazon!"
1,Why spend this much money for a lousy copy,"The book itself is wonderful, especially if you're a Grace Livingston Hill fan, or if you like sweet, old-fashioned love stories! But this edition, which is WAY too expensive, is also very very very poorly scanned copy--there are egregious errors on every single page, some becoming almost unreadable. Do not believe their hype about ""preserving this important cultural item"" You can get the regular paperback from Amazon, or undoubtedly from an auction site."
1,Please refund my money!,"This was my favorite book as a teen, my copy fell apart I read it so often. Sadly I neglected to read the reviews before I purchased the Kindle edition. It is very poorly done, type-O's, characters inserted into words. This is a classic turned into a worthless item. Amazon should either refund everyone who has purchased this book or make corrections and send everyone a new version!"
5,This is a novel of enduring romance that is permeated with the characters love of the almighty inserted in the forefront.,"A very sweet story about a family in such dire straights that they have chosen to live in a barn.Father has just died. Mother is extremely ill. The house they have been renting will be demolished shortly. As the eldest of five children it is Shirley's responsibility to ensure that a new home is provided. How is she to do that? Because of a death in the firm, Shirley is given a half day off and she, perhaps unwisely, uses it to take a ride to the country hoping that a home will just appear. Yet the most peaceful spot she finds is at a barn. She falls in love and decides that it must do - at least, if she can get the owner to rent it."
4,Definately worth buying for novice 3D game programmers.,"While the actual source code forthe game will probably not be ofany great use to anyone at thistime, I thought that it did anexcellent job teaching thefundamentals of 3D design andrendering. I would consider ita ""must have"" for anyone justbeginning to get into the worldof graphics programming."
5,Great book,This is an outstanding book articulating some the most important matters concerning forgiveness. MacArthur does a great job giving a biblical position on this matter.
2,Too Biblical,"I found this book too biblical with too many references and I am definite so many others who study theology will be satisfied with this book but I am someone who prefers such a topic to be described in a simple emotional tone fluently rather than a very reasonable explanation from the scripture. I believe in this because forgiveness must be touched before it is practiced, it cannot be understood or proven. This book is missing that emotional touch, and discouraged me to read it till the end."
4,if you see it get it,i recently bought this double disc in toronto. I was just feeling indian music at that time so i bought it and it had a dan the auto mater track. overall its got some chessy dance tracks but overall a great album and as a person who is in to hip hop mainly i loved this album.
2,Twenty minutes,It is not clear to me why this CD was released. I was not familiar with the piece when I bought it and so I was very surpised that the entire recording came in at around twenty minutes. No sooner have you put it in the CD player and its over. The recording is fine but there are better values out there for your money.
4,Mid-Summer before Complete Lawnmower Received,"I like the Great States lawnmower. It is much better than the Scotts lawnmower that I had to take back to Home Depot because I couldn't cut the grass. However, it was mid-summer before I received the parts to the Great States lawnmower. It came without any of the screws, the handles, and the manual. I had to get those from Great States which took some time."
4,Women's Pink Watch,This seller is awesome - I had a shipping problem and he took care of it. The watch is very nice.
2,Halfway To Heaven,"This is the first ""in-depth"" book I have ever read on Ms. Staton, and while it gets me slightly familiar with the person behind the soulful voice, there is a much more to be desired. I thought the book was poorly written and edited. The information contained in this book could have been summed up in a two hour interview. There are no dates given throughout the book, not to mention the little mention of her song catalog- her hits and the stories behind them. She even failed to state her birth name and birthdate. I think greater justice can be done to Ms. Staton's legacy if a biography was written incorporating this book into an expanded, in-depth look at the life of this soul turned gospel legend. I would suggest, in all love, that Ms. Staton grab the microphone before reaching for a pen again."
1,When you wake up tomorrow,"As the song recorded by the author asks, yes, the reader will want to forget ever reading this book. Although it is the self-told story of a phenomenal rise to fame and an anti-climactic decision to focus on spirituality, it gives little insight as to the events surrounding the author's life and talent other than the series of misfortunate interactions with men that seem to mirror the story told in chapter one of her father. There are opinions espoused about just about everyone, and some may find them offensive. The writing style is juvenile and often tedious due to its lack of chronological continuity and a strange interjection of commentary from the writer and her spouse in the last half of the book. The book transitions abruptly from the story of a gifted, dirt-poor child to a sermon by the last chapter having little to do with the story being told. This is proof that one can wake up tomorrow and 'forget all the things you said tonight.'"
5,Great Tool,"I just ran across one of these at a tag sale and had to have due to the novelty and compactness of it. I love it! I didn't even see the level vile in it until I read the description and saw it there.This tool, at least the one that I have, is all aluminum and rather robust. It's compact size with all the important scales of the rafter square is a huge draw. Anyone that knows tools knows that a rafter square is not something that you put in your tool box or bag and carry along, but this tool will fit right in and go with you anywhere.I would recommend this to anyone."
2,"Cheap plastic parts, not like original",A friend had one of the old versions of this. I purchased since I liked his. This one has a cheap plastic part on it and isn't made well at all.
4,A surprise!,"I was expecting the old ""best of"", including ""Easy Living, the Wizard, Lady in Black"", etc.Instead, this is a collection from several of their albums from the later 70's and the 80's.Some, like the first track, are pretty good; others I will probably not listen to again.The surround channels are well and creatively used.For the price I was happy with it!TRACK LIST:1.

2,Disappointed...not accompaniment arrangements,"I love singing jamie's songs, and if you're looking for good arrangements of his songs, this IS NOT it.The piano plays his melodies in EVERY song! I also bought The Pursuit and it's the same in that book. So Disappointed."
5,as good as the Fender picks,"I am not a pick snob. Usually just play with the standard Fender or Jim Dunlop picks. Like finding a bargain though and these are as good as those, if you buy in bulk. Some people have talked about the shipping charges being too high. Maybe. It costs something for a guy to actually put them in a box and send them to you though. :)This is a good ""standard"" pick. Nice action. If you're like me and always losing picks, get a gross of these and you'll be good for a long time. You'll also save on shipping."
2,rip off,"i bought these picks paid for 12 only got 6 dont, waste your money you will pay more for shipping them than the picks cost"
3,Musicians friend pick,"I thnk it's a pretty good product. It doesn't look exactly like the pictures shown. It has a black pearl effect and on one side a big silver ""Musicians Friend"" logo that can be very easily scraped off if undesired. All in all good value."
4,$200.00 ????????? for picks,"Musician's Friend Standard Celluloid Guitar Picks 1 Dozen, Black $200.00 ????????? for picks wow"
3,Necesarias y listo,"Si necesitas un juego de uñas BBB, compra este articulo. Nada en particular con el mismo, las compre por necesidad y bueno sin distinciones, color o forma en particular."
1,The seller cheats,"I bought a guitar at $199 from this seller. When I got it, the guitar is worn and paint is off. The strings hit the fret heavily. It's highly defective and of vey low quality. And the seller reduced the price by $30 the day after I bought it. I feel so cheated.I also ordered a strap from the seller. I called to cancel the order before it was shipped. They accepted my cancellation but shipped the product to me and billed me anyway.Don't buy anything from this seller. Or you will definitely regret."
4,"Good picks, good buy.","They're cheap, durable, feel good, look great, and there's really no noticable difference between them and more expensive teardrop picks except the price and the logo."
2,Watch out for the shipping charges,"Thought I paid a little more attention. Bought this item at the same time as some other items. Wasn't paying complete attention (my fault) but ended up paying an additional $4 for shipping... for the $2 picks.Price should be listed as $6, not $2. Ordered on a Saturday, too late to cancel by Sunday, it said had been shipped even though the confirmation shipping email said shipped on Monday.Kind of a ripoff...Edit Oct 2008****Contacted by company and they decided to refund the shipping charges this time. It seems like they listened and tried to do the right thing which is appreciated. Thanks to Musician's Friend****"
2,"Good Product, Bad Customer Service","Contrary to the vendor's arrival date, one of my items have been placed on backorder for nearly a month. I was not notified about the change and only found out when I inquired by phone. The customer representative did not apologize for the company and did not offer any form of resolution for the inconvenience. The first product arrived in good shape and on-time, but I am dissatisfied with the customer service when a mistake is made."
2,Without vim and vigor,"I so much wanted to like this new collection of Chaplin music but ended up quite disappointed. The pacing of the songs is simply too plodding, slow and lacking the excitement of the actual film versions. This is especially true with the overture from ""Modern Times"" and the thematic music used throughout ""The Kid."" The dancing segment from ""City Lights"" is a punchy jazz piece, designed to be played vulgar and loud. Forget it with this arrangement, which sounds like something out of the Hollyridge Strings.There are many compilations of Chaplin music and though this is the newest offering, it is by no means the superior choice. Opt instead for the actual soundtracks from his films, where you hear the music as it was intended to be heard. I doubt even CC himself would embarce this staid and arthritic collection, where forceful tunes are reduced to wan drivel."
1,Totally did not fit the movie,The soundtrack seemed totally out of place to me. The music was just way too overdramatic and distracts trhe viewer from an otherwise good film. Don't bother to buy the soundtrack.
4,Great Score from Terrence Blanchard,"I was very surprised to hear a score for this film that was so moving, emotionally. There are segments of the score that reflect the errie feel of New York City post September 11. However, certain tracks, like track 12 entitled, ""Sleeping Is Natural,"" is a nice piece of music that reflects the love them in the film. Also, track 10 is a great one to listen to. Combinging a jazzy feeling with the love them, it creates a relaxing mood with it's piano and strings sections."
3,Great Score - but where's the Soundtrack?,I bought this CD recently because I loved the score to the movie but also because I loved the music featured in the movie. I was disappointed to hear that only the score was featured - I'm dying for the Soundtrack and can't find it - if anyone knows where/what to find please let me know by email.
2,where's the non-score soundtrack?,"i echo the sentiments of another user on here...the music in the movie was great, and i'd like to find THAT soundtrack!..."
4,"given what it is, it ain't bad","You would think that an album full of cover songs, done by a pop punk band, would be a recipe for disaster. Not so in this case. The Vindictives are a strong enough band, with enough snotty bile and vitriol to inject even the most innocuous of songs with some punk pep. And as far as format goes, this was formerly issued as a CD with only 1 track, comprising all the songs, and it appended a few extras at the end (the Vindictives Sex Pistols 5"") but now that it has been reissued, the tracks are all demarcated so you may listen democratically, instead of fast forwarding through 1 huge 50 minute track. Though I think the extras got torpedoed in the process (which, if that is the case, is a negligible loss). This and The Many Moods Of... are the perfect duo to introduce anyone to the brilliance of The Vindictives."
3,4 stars if.....,This is an awsome cd. The only problem is it's only one track. There's about an hour of music with many songs but only one friggin track! Therefore you can't skip ahead. That's ok because all the songs are good.
5,The Primer of Indian Cooking,"As a non-Indian, I had no idea where to begin with cooking Indian food. It all seemed so complicated and alien. Enter this book: extensive descriptions of what should be in your pantry and what to use it for, spice blends, oils, rice, chapati, and so much more it makes my head spin! Granted, the author is a little hardcore when it comes to prep, shortcuts are easily found (she wants you to grind all your own spices and blend them right before cooking, blanche tomatoes, make your own cashew paste, and other VERY time consuming and unnecessary things that I doubt anyone does unless they just have to). I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about Indian cooking, not just recipes, but the principles of putting together a fragrant and flavorful dish with spice."
2,kindle version not very useful,the kindle version of this book is not very useful. most of the recipes are pictures so you cannot book copy or bookmark the actual pages of ingredients. also i was surprised that there are a very limited amount of vegetable dishes.
4,Pactical advise por a plan,"Throughout this book, you'll find practical advise on devising and implementing a effective crisis management plan. Though not a theoretical approach, the cases presented are very helpfull."
2,The MINISCULE VIEWFINDER is a TREMENDOUS Problem,"Believe me, and believe any other review that criticizes the tiny viewfinder on this camera. It may have top-quality optics and an abundance of admirable features, but you're likely to miss most photo opportunities (especially in twilight and darkness) as you struggle to place the viewfinder over your eye.Most of the photos we obtained with this Minox captured the moment after a great picture COULD HAVE been taken, and even then were generally off-center. I thought I would become acclimated, but frustration got the better of me and the camera was returned for refund."
2,Not worth the wait,"I ordered this book a few months ago but publication of it was delayed. When it finally I arrived, I was disappointed. This book is primarily aimed at people wanting to open a DVD authoring business and spends much more time on business models, work orders and project work flow than on the technical details of creating DVDs. The included DVD is a planetarium-style slide show of astronomical information. While it is interesting, it does not illustrate the full flexibility of a DVD or even many of the options commonly used in feature film DVDs.Jim Taylor's DVD Demystified is far more useful to me."
2,Very dissappointing,"I was eagerly looking forward to reading this book. I was dissappointed by it's contents. Despite the title there is very little information about how to actually produce a DVD. It concentrates more on the business aspect.A shame considering the authors experience. His reluctance to delve deeper into an authoring program of choice (obviously Scenarist) results in a shallow example of how you produce a DVD. As of this writing, still no book exists that actually teaches you the production process. Amazing considering it's rapidly growing popularity."
4,A good read but don't expect to learn any trade secrets.,"Houdini!!! by Keneth Silverman is an entertaining read that held my interest to the end, and this is not a reflection of the fact that he died well ""before his time""! Regardless, he had several ""careers"" and his final one, in the role of debunking the spiritualists was every bit as fascinating as his escapes. I don't begrudge Silverman maintaining the magician's code of secrecy regarding tricks but I think he could have done more to shed light on how Houdini acquired and developed his enormous talent as an escape artist. In the book, which moves right along through a very eventful life, the amazing feats just reel off as if they just came to him without a great deal of effort. But this is quibbling, there is plenty here to hold the reader's attention and the almost laughably egotistical Houdini is a most appealing character"
3,conflict of interest,"The author had a conflict of interest while writing this book. On the one hand, as a former magician, he didn't want to give away any trade ""secrets."" But as a writer he had the responsibility not to short-change the reader by omitting important details. I found the second half of the book that covered Houdini's bitter relationship with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and the exposing of fraudulant mediums much more interesting than the first half where Silverman ""kept the secrets."" How can the reader fully appreciate Houdini's performances if the preparations that went into them are omitted? Besides, there are few magic ""secrets"" left to be guarded as most have already been published--see Jim Steinmeyer's ""Hiding the Elephant"" for a recent example. I can understand Silverman's decision to abide by ""the code,"" but it does detract from the book's appeal, hence only three stars."
3,"Informative - Yes. But, boring","I bought this book for my father, who is a huge magic-buff, and recalls hearing about Houdini while growing up.Of course, I knew then that my father never reads books, and my hopes that he would break that pattern and read this one were lost. So, I took it home and read it. Er, read most of it.I enjoyed the historical aspects of the story, but I couldn't get past the fact that the manner in which the book is written was less than enthralling. I just couldn't stay interested! I wanted to, I wanted to!!If you're interested in learning about Houdini, I'd find something smaller to being your foray - like a three-fold brochure or something.Houdini ROCKED! This book doesn't."
3,scent not quite strong enough,"my title says it all. i love the scent , but it's almost impreceptible after i've put 2 satchets in each drawer. i've purchased one more pack and will put more in my closet and see if it makes a difference. would be nice if i could actually smell it!"
2,Not worth the money,Very little fragrance. Not worth the money. I hung it in closet and there is no fragrance that hangs in air or clings to clothes.
5,Smells great!,"I am finally organizing my seasonal clothing and have found these little packets handy to avoid musty smells. They are a bit pricey, but highly recommended."
5,DIVINE,i ORDERED THESE TO HANG IN ALL OF MY CLOSETS AND LINEN DRAWERS TO PROTECT FROM BUGS THEY ARRIVED QUICKLY AND ARE HARD AT WORK THROUGHOUT MY HOUSE.
5,Reviews were RIGHT! Great stuff.,"I was looking for packets to prevent moths in my newly purchased cashmeres. I bought this on the stength of the reviews. I was not disappointed. So easy to snip off one of these generous fragrant packs to place in a drawer. I'll be ordering more. So convenient, so fragrant."
5,Otra puertorriquena con el talento para poner a P.R.en alto!,Esta produccion esta fabulosa. La muchacha canta fabuloso y tiene una fuerza interpretativa increible. El talento que posee Arana es unico y no hay nadie ahora mismo en P.R. que se le pueda parar al lado!!!!!
1,Otra persona sin talento que decide hacer un disco.,"Este disco no es representativo de la mejor música de Puerto Rico. Quedé desilusionado al escuchar el disco y sus canciones sin sentido y llenas de frases irrelevantes. No es un disco que trascienda, y recomiendo a la artista una reconsideración en su opción de estilo de música. Tal vez un disco de merengue hubiera tenido éxito."
1,Not representative of good Puertorican music,"The music and the lyrics are disappointing as the price I paid for the CD. The sound of the recording is awful, the lyrics are childish, and their objective seems to be happy little songs. These songs would make great jingles. I recommend another choice, because there are great new artists that come from Puerto Rico for example Marc Anthony, Jessica Cristina and Millie Correger. If you hear this CD you will understand my point of view, and thank me for warning you about not buying it."
4,A Very Informative Work,"Written as a companion piece to Arts and Enertainments special The Story Of The Gun this book is very well written, researched and even witty in places. My only complaint is Mr. Hogg gives very detailed descriptions of how many of the weapons work and in the case of machine guns etc some diagrams would have been very helpful. Other then that its an excellent addition to any gun buff's library."
4,TUNIS WRITES ABOUT FATHER-SON RECONCILIATION,"Although this book is considered part of John R. Tunis' Brooklyn Dodger series, it's really not quite within that description. The main character, Joe Nugent, is a young infielder whose father is pitching great Razzle Nugent of the Dodgers. Ol' Raz is wrapping up his career with the Brooks, and son Joe has a smoldering resentment towards a father who never had much time for him while he was growing up. The book mostly concerns itself with Joe's climb up the New York Yankees ladder and his effort to both come to grips with his father while trying to get out from under Raz's shadow. Although you miss the Dodger players from the previous novels like Roy Tucker, Karl Case, Red Allen and others, this is well worth reading for the message of reconciliation it carries. In that regard, baseball is a metaphor here much like the movie ""Field of Dreams"" was (but without the ghosts and the cornfield). Sons and fathers both should read this one."
3,MUDDY RECORDING,The remastering of this recording is poor and at times is muddy. Too bad because Janet Baker is fantastic and the orchestra is excellent.
1,Don't Buy the mp3s!,"This is an absolutely gorgeous CD, but track 11 on CD 2 is corrupted! I downloaded it twice, and both times it stopped 20 seconds before the end and then started skipping. It sounded like Amazon uploaded a bad CD to their website. How cheap!When I called customer service, they told me there is nothing they can do. I still haven't heard back, and it's been two days. If you want this CD, do yourself a favor and get the physical copy."
2,Recording quality muddy,"The execution of the music is fine. However, the recording is muddy. I recommend other recordings & avoiding this one."
4,"Paratroopers, a valuable military tool.","This book follows the training and first drops of the Fallschirmjager, which taught the allies the use of airborne troops. But as a quirk of fate would have it; after Crete Hitler decided they could no longer be used because the surprise of airborne drops had been extended. These elite forces were still used as ground troops until the end of the war. In this book we examine and trace their history through the eye of the camera lens."
4,My husband loves it,My husband told me a year ago he wanted a spyderco knife when we were walking around the mall one night and made our way into a knife store. He showed me the model he wanted and I wrote it down so that I could remember the model#. This knife was exactly like the one we saw in the store except the clip was on backwards. He said most clips on knives are on so that the knife can be flipped open easily when you pull it out of your pocket and this one is on in the opposite direction. Everything else about this product as well as the speed of delivery is fully satisfactory.
4,Great product but not perfect.,Spyderco has the best designs and you know it is great quality when you hold one. Open it almost effortlessly with one hand. Press the release to close it and feel again how well it is made. My only disappointment has been that I broke the tip of the blade off. I was totally surprised when it happened and am unhappy with how brittle the blade is. I was able to sharpen it back to a point again but know now that it is not made to be a hard working knife. If you don't have one yet you are missing out.
5,good design great every day knife,"this knife is simple,well built, the blade is sharp, nice grip, light weight, big bang for the money..cant go wrong...highly recommended"
4,Greatest Love Songs,"Tom's forceful and strong voice you wouldn't think would be a good match for love ballads. He manages to pull off lots of sensitivity here, so very romantic."
5,Love all of Tom jones,Have almost all of his songs. They say you get better with age and he is holding up to that.
5,bouque of western swing and country steel guitar,"howard white loves the country steel guitar. bring his vocal and pete drake's merverous country steel guitar. othermusicians : pete wade, dave kirby, buddy spicher, buddy harman. here comes vivid country music. this album have nicewestern wind."
4,A MUST FOR FANS!,"Being a huge fan of both Spike Lee and Martin Scorsese this is a great set to own. Plus, you get to have it on dvd,what more could you ask for?I managed to get a sneak peek at this set from a friend of mine and let me tell you its worth every cent. The picture quality is ok but who really cares its a documentary about Scorsese and Lee! The sound is average but the real meat is of course the information about the making of their films, and bios of their life. I really loved hearing about Goodfellas.This set goes into much more detail then i thought it would.So, i really think that if your a fan of these two guys then their shouldn't even be a thought in your mind except to buy this great dvd. Its worth being in your collection. Trust me, and before I go:""Are you talking at me.""(I just had to do it,hee-hee)."
3,Swing......and miss,"I was really hoping for something grand, but what I got was more of a side project that was cut straight from the board, and with minimum post-production. Don't get me wrong - the singles ""Dreamtime,"" ""1000 Watts fo Your Love"" etc are great, but the second CD was just not up to the quality that I expect from L&R. The swing tunes lack the creativity of the eponymous album it is packaged with. True fans will enjoy the tunes -- and I always love hearing new L&R material -- but its just not a standout release."
3,Improved?,"While I doubt many fans would call this their best album, I think we can agree it was the most popular one they had. Thanks to the hit ""So Alive"", and the alternative craze I'm sure. To be honest, I really do like this original album, however unless this is your personal favorite, or you never got it the first time, or you're a completist, I'd say you can pass on this re-release. The bonus tracks are decent, and the extra disc is interesting, but neither is essential. Sure it's nice to hear a track like ""Dreamtime"" again, and the ""Swing"" disc actually sounds almost like swing, but some of the extras aren't good, and the interview I'll never listen to a second time. Overall the disc is solid L&R, but I'd say the bonus songs are ""No Big Deal"". I will however recommend ""Earth Sun Moon"" for a more acoustic L&R, and ""Lift"" for a more techno-pop sound."
3,Not their best...,"If you want a better Love and Rockets experience, try Express, Or Seventh Dream of Teenage Heaven."
2,A thoroughly mediocre record from a once great band,"Aside from the cheesy mainstream single, So Alive, there is nothing to see here other than stuff that should have never made it to the DAT. Get Express and Seventh Dream, maybe also Earth Sun Moon. Forget the rest."
5,Beautiful model!,"I teach 5th Grade and like to display historical dioramas on my window sill to help me illustrate units we're studying. I can't wait to put this up, surrounded by little redcoats, when I teach the War of 1812 (the capital won't have the dome then), and later, surrounded by cannons and Union soldiers, who will protect it during the Civil War.Great quality product, fun to put together (for kids, too!). I will buy other models in this series now that I see how great this is."
3,"Good, but has flaws.","As a fan of all incarnations of Batman, this audio book delivered a much needed fix. The action is fast paced and the premise is a good one. Lots of different voice actors with Alfred being the highlight. I actually thought the Joker was a good one, though I much rather Mark Hamill's rendition in the animated series. There are lots of voice actors here, rather that an audiobook's usual one.However, there are some flaws. It can move too quickly at times, leaving the listener floundering to keep up. I would have much rather had it drawn out for better character development. The action sequences are over quickly, and usually only battle sound effects. Almost everything is acted 3rd person, so we don't get into the minds of the characters often.That said, I did enjoy listening to this and the conclusion was satisfying. It has terrific potential to be adapted to the big screen or as a series. Still, I would not pay good money to buy this...I got mine at my local library."
5,Now this is STAND-UP!.....No 3 guys walk into a bar jokes!,"We all know ""Joke Books"" suck. This is not one of those!These are compiled one liners of some big name, and not so big name comedians. They are categorized by subject well. I'm a comedy writter and aspiring comedian myself and this is a cant miss book, even if you're a Gallagher fan."
1,There is a better Grammar Book,"For those interested in a clear and concise White Hmong Grammar book, one may be bought by calling (559) 304-1549 (ITI) who sells this grammar. The author taught Hmong for 2 years at BYU and has worked as a Hmong interpreter for 8 years."
4,Roman Roamin',"Reading this book is like roaming through 2000 years of the Roman empire and all the transplanted Romans who grace the US. I loved it and I'm not Italian. And, sorry, Leon, but I don't even want to be Italian. I've got a better idea. Why don't you do one on Jewish or Irish people? They're pretty entertaining. The book probably deserves five stars, but I'd like to see some graphics in it, so I just gave it four."
2,not so great.....,"these are definitely tiny and not substantial at all. I didnt feel they were worth the money,"
3,It is an Intro book...,"This really is an intro book. It throws a lot of terminology at you, barely scratches the surface on topics and doesn't get into much detail. It's pretty average.The cd-rom with the book is about worthless, ironically the sound quality of the clips is poor, leaving you to wonder if you have a hearing problem of your own!"
4,I liked this book..,"I took a class at college about communication disorders and the professor used this book. I didn't pick up on any bias or negativity like the previous raters stated. I haven't read the whole book but it's basically an introductory book about communication disorders and the book helps you to understand why different disorders are classified and diagnosed the way they are. I probably would not buy this book for reading on vacation but the class I took was interesting and this booked helped me to clarify some of the concepts that we were learning. A good introductory book about the subject, I think."
2,Uninspiring...,"This is the first Judy Collins CD I ever buy and she sounds tired... or maybe she is bored with the songs. WHY?The album contains a number of cover songs made famous by (The Beatles, Sinatra...), in other words, they are timeless, CLASSICS.Skip it. I'm sure there are much better recordings by this artist than this album...."
2,Disappointed...,"This isn't the Judy Collins I remember hearing when she and I were both younger. She doesn't do the songs made famous by other artists justice, nor does she even do her own old hits justice."
5,for all who has doubt of this cd,"this cd has to be one of the best cds out there... this woman had nothing when she was young and now she has everything, her voice, her fans and her heart ... this has to be one of her best cds and as a dominican im proud to say she will always remain the queen of merengue"
5,Sage Advice,"I don't think this book offers anything new for neither the top professional poker player nor the CEOs of the Fortune 500. However, anyone else in between will surely come away with at least a few common sense gems of wisdom which can be applied in our everyday lives. The stories about the colourful poker characters and crabby old office ladies are somewhat interesting. It is when the author explains how to understand and benefit from their motives is where the value of this fine read shows through. Apparently the author has a lot more sage advice than he does hair. I plan on re-reading this at least once a year."
2,not what i was looking for,this book is for people who are trying to make a career out of draw manga because the techniques and the tools they tell you to use is for art students or artist i was just trying to get a better understanding of value on a manga figure and around the figure as well it was no help to me but if you understand that kind of stuff then buy it
5,for serious toners a must,"been using tone for 2 years now, and even living here in japan. i can tell you i have yet to see many tone books, well maybe 2 others under i.c. screen. and they were not really that good either. but this book tells you how to do some sweet effects, picks up where how to manga vol.3 left off, so if you use tone, and want to have a look like the japanesse comics, i would say not getting this book is a mistake."
5,one of the best albums in my collection,"the exciting wilson pickett is a wonderful album and deserves to be in your collection. people might not request it at a party, but they will be shaking their mashed potatoes and doing the twist once the needle hits it. get it! you won't be sorry."
3,A coheasive collection of a master,"As a Copeland fan and classical music amateur, I have really enjoyed this collection. It includes all my favorite pieces with lovely arrangements. While I may not be able to speak to the quality of the orchestras, I can say I am pleased with the recording quality anbd presentation of these works."
4,Release-- Better then nothing,"In my opinion this album is some of A.H.'s best work. If you want to hear them at their best avoid the latter two albums like the plague, and stick to the good sh!t. Granted you will be much more amused if you have a chane to listen to the original release of this album, but the music quality is in tact. Other releases I would suggest by this band is Inverse, Reverse, Perverse, and Date Rape Nation\Jerk Lessons split CD.Thanks Danny"
3,"Good film, terrible DVD","I guess you don't have to rave about the superior direction and acting anymore, as this is one of the 70's films which deserves its cult reputation. I only wish the production of this DVD had been adequate - the image is good, but the sound is TERRIBLE. Especially the opening scene in the monitoring room and the scene with Yvette Mimieux meeting the teenage hitchhikers are hardly audible. My dupe of the old Warner rental tape sounds better. Shame on you, guys!"
4,Well-Acted Prison Drama,"Jackson County Jail is an interesting and well-acted prison drama. Yvette Mimieux and Tommy Lee Jones especially give good performances as the outlaws on the run from the cops. I enjoyed the cameo by Mary Woronov as well. Too bad she was only in one scene. Pretty disappointing ending, and the movie is a little slow at times, but worth seeing at least once."
3,security torx,"Cheap enough, but the hole is only in the short end of each wrench. So where clearance is limited, you are forced to do a lot of quarter turns."
2,Not so great...,"The center holes were not deep enough or wide enough to go over the little nub in the middle of the screws. I had to use them at an angle to get the screws to turn at all. Of the four screws I needed to get out, this tool set only worked on two."
1,False Advertisement,"I have ordered a Torx Wrench set with 9 pieces by Torx and they sent me some stupid brand of tools that i have never even heard of called American Tool Exchanged, and they are made in Taiwan and made out of lead, i think it it lead because it says that the chemical used is known to the State of California to cause cancer birth defects, and other reproductive harm. So they sent me a crappy tool set, and it made me mad."
2,Amazon Security Torx Wrench Set,"Cheap set was only 50% functional. The short end of the ""L"" had the hole in the end, which fits the security screw feature. The long end of the ""L"" DID NOT, which was the one needed to reach the recessed screws that I was working on. I gave up on the cheap ""Made in China"" product and found a cheap ""Made in South Korea"" product that finally got the job done."
1,No es una buena compra,"Las recetas son muy basicas, lo que se esperaria de una receta comercial. Este libro para nada representa la comida mexicana // el precio del libro esta por arriba de lo que vale //"
2,Not recommended,"A very inexpensive sprayer that seems to be well manufactured. Unfortunately, this is where the story turns sour. My Hudson 1 Gallon ""Eliminator"" sprayer came COMPLETELY DISASSEMBLED with about 10-12 different parts for me to figure out. The assembly instructions are unclear and the illustrations are so poor as to be worthless. After about 45 minutes of assembling, disassembling, checking and re-checking the compression fittings and ""O"" rings, I was unable to get this sprayer to work quite right. I'll be returning this sprayer today. Don't waste your time with this one."
1,BAD!,Very dissapointed with this book! I didn't like it! maybe because i don't agree with the technique they use to discipline the kids!
5,Muy útil.,"Es muy útil como una herramienta para educar niños sin el uso continuó del regaño y castigo, especialmente para padres primerizos."
1,"1,2,3 Magia (the worst spanish translation never seen in my life)","FriendsThe title of my review, is literal and exactly as you can read.The worst spanish translation as you could never imaginePlease, contract a professional services of a good translate company, andforget to sell more copies of that book meanwhile."
4,Everybody educating a small child should read this book!,"This book gives parents and teachers the best tool to educate small children. It works so well with the difficult toddlers and preschoolers. The English version is better,, but the translated issue is an excellent option for Spanish speakers. I highly recommend it if you are educating a young child!"
5,Helped us a lot!,"I was sceptical at first, but we found the techniques in this book to be a terrific help in raising our three kids."
3,Tacticas de disciplina,"Es buen libro para disciplinar a algunos chicos que les gusta argumentar y cuestionar. Siento que marca una linea bastante fuerte entre los padres y los hijos. Me refiero a la autoridad casi como de policia y ciudadano, o un amo con un perro. Me gustaria que asi como habla de disciplina tambien hablara de como demostrar el amor a los hijos."
3,Low volume output,"The Creative Labs 128 MB MP3 player is an excellent unit except that the volume is very low in an average noise environment. THIS DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE!!! so be willing to accept this if you decide to purchase this unit. In a quiet room the volume is O.K. but on a city street the volume is too low, even at maximum."
3,Complete waste of money,"I reviewed this about a year ago and said that its limitations were starting to annoy me. Know I would say this thing in no way is worth buying for the listed price. It is pretty much junk. Here are my pros and cons.ProsGood SoundLightFlash basedRuns on AA batteriesCons-Big-Doesn't read most ID3 tags-Bundled software always crashes, and it doesn't work well with 3rd party software.-Uses obsolute SmartMedia cards that only go up to 128 MB-Despite manufacturer's claims, firmware has not been updated to support formats other than MP3 or wMA.-Can't use playlists-Bundled headphones are poor-Menu of tracks listed by file name (and then only the first 7 characters) so if you have a lot of tracks named similarly (like from the same album or artist) they will all read ""Led Zep~"" So you can't tell one from the other.-Very small amount of memory. 256 MB max is only good for about 4 albums.-Belt clip is bulky and loose.That this thing still costs more than the new iPod Shuffle is a joke."
2,problems (not with mac os X),"I have had a terrible time getting this thing to work with windows XP. There were errors on the installation, I contacted support, got a lame, involved and not very helpful response. I de-installed the software hoping to go back to the website later to find a comprehensive new installer but have had no luck after 6 months. I have a fairly ""vanilla"" laptop that has no problems intalling other software, and I really hate installation problems with out of the box software. Perhaps you will have more luck than I did, but... I would have RMA'd the thing if I did not have a mac. BUT... Now I just use it with my wife's Mac OSX machine and ITunes, and with that it works perfectly."
4,Excellent for workouts,"After reading many customer reviews online, I finally decided to ask ""santa"" for this one... I have been highly impressed with all aspects. However, I cannot for the life of me figure out how to insert the SmartMedia 128MB card. Everyone else seems to have an easy time with this- but for some reason, it won't just 'slide in' properly. I wonder which way the card is supposed to go?"
5,"Simple, functional, exactly what i was looking for","No fancy software. No complex interface. Just a simple, straightforward, easy-to-use and reliable device. I love it for jogging. It's light and easy to hold. Given the reviews I've read of competing products, this one is a no-brainer. Buy it."
1,NO BUY!,"I got this as a present, and I was so excited to have an Mp3 player. I was all excited to load up some songs onto this sucker and go, but it didn't have enough room for more than 16 songs!!! I think that this is terrible because the software's terrible and it takes such a long time. The sound quality is totally TERRIBLE. This is not worth this much money and whoever priced it must have been on glue, I would just pay a little extra for a better mp3 player that might have some more effort put into it. Now I have an iRiver player, and it is totally awesome. It can store so much and the design isn't quite as bad."
1,Horrible,"The support software was extremely cumbersome and downright painful to use. Although it claims to have 128kb of memory, it held less than ten songs. ..."
1,Defective,"My Nomad II-C MP3 player was defective right out of the box, I shipped it back to Creative for an RMA and they signed for my player on Feb 19. It is still sitting on the ""tech"" bench right now, 6 weeks later. I call almost everyday and they tell me that their testing department has had problems, they will test my player as soon as the department is up and running again!!I will never purchase another Creative product again."
1,Broke after 110 days of use NO WARRANTY,"Hello, I bought this product back in January of 2003 thinking that it would last for a bit. Instead it unexpectedly stopped working at the end of April and since it is past the 90-day warranty period the manufacturer will not assume responsibility for the item. The product worked very well, the software that comes with the MP3 player is very good and it is easy to use. However, I must say that since this product broke so soon and the warranty does not protect it, makes me very upset with this purchase."
3,"Sounds good for price, but so-so performance","voice recordings easily overpowered, no in line mic option.erased all my files after one week, need to reformat memorysoftware is so-so at best, too many steps to do simple things, not well organizedSeems to work fine, except when it erased my files. Menu is ok, once you get used to it, but could be simpler.Sound seemed good"
5,My Nomad has performed well,"This is the first MP3 player I bought and I've been very happy with it so far. I use it only at the gym and have had zero problems with it for about the past year. The software that comes with it is simple enough to use. The sound is good and allows different settings, which is handy sometimes. It is also fairly rugged as I have dropped it a few times but it always come back to life. I also like the compact size of it. I recommend it."
1,UGH!,"omg! I am so angry, i got this piece of sh*** a couple of hours ago. i installed everything, and then i plug it in using the USB, and what do u know the Creative Player Cemter 2 tells me that my player is NOT connected or that it's busy, please try again later! WTF! what's up with that? can some1 help me.........i am so angry!"
1,Do not buy this,"I haven't even owned this mp3 player for a full hour and I'm already returning it to the store. I spent half an hour trying to load music onto this and ended up doing it completely by accident. When I checked its memory it was almost half full, I barely loaded 12 tracks onto it! Ontop of that the interface is completely confusing, I can't figure out anything on this player. I was told that it could hold at least a hundred songs, expect more like 30!Do not by this!! Its deffinetly worth it to pay more for a better mp3 player."
1,Good while it lasted,"Seems like there are a lot of defective ones out there....Mine worked great until I had to change the battery. After that, it never worked again! I'm in the return process."
4,Good product,"This is a great little player. I bring it everywhere I go and it serves its purpose. It feels like it is well built. I got a 128mb sm card to go with it which gives a total of 256 mb. I was able to get 96 songs on my player and card combined using Windows Media Player to compress it. That is about 9 hours of music!! The headphones are okay, but get uncomfortable after awhile. I have a good pair of Koss headphones and they sound great. I gave it four stars because I love the product, but the one I got was defective. It was easily replaced by Creative though and the new one works great!! Get this product if you are looking for a good inexpensive player."
3,Maybe good for some people,"My husband bought Nomad II (c) for my birthday because he knows I like music and want to have something to listen to while jogging. However, it froze a couple of times during the first week. So I returned it and bought a iRiver SlimX iMP-350 and I am happy with my decision.Pros about Nomad II (c):- small, light- using memory, won't skip- have a clock- have recording capability- use one AA batteryCons:- It has limited capacity, even with 128 MB. For people like me who has lot of discs and likes to listen to a variety of music, it is not very convenient to tranfer files constantly.- feels cheap- To view time, you have to navigate and push the buttons several timesMy point is it maybe good for some people but not everybody."
5,Price makes this choice a slam dunk,"I've owned mine for a year. I have ripped my cd collection to my computer using MusicMatch so I make frequent changes to what's on my Nomad, using the drag and drop feature.As a runner, I wanted a player with no moving parts (even though hard drive units have gigabytes instead of megabytes of space). I've dropped this player a few times and it has been forgiving.I love this player! It fits well in my hand while running. The headset is comfortable. A rechargeable AA battery provides hours of listening. LCD shows artist and title. I've never used the voice recording.There are newer players that offer a slightly higher quality of playback sound and they are even smaller, but heck, look at the price of this unit!I'm ordering one now for a birthday gift. MP3 players are really best in the hands of people who know how to handle files on a computer."
3,Battery Killer,"Great little MP3 player for the money.The side jack rubber cover is extremely awkward to open.Fresh AA battery will NOT last the entire play list of 32+ songs.Tried every possible battery type, with minimal volume.IF you buy it - get the 128 flash memory for it.Otherwise, our next MP3 is going to be much more power efficient."
2,Not for Audio Books,For music the nomad was great. But do not get it for audio books! It lacks a continue feature forcing you to restart from the beginning of the track. and it lack a fast forward within the track that would have mitigated the obove issue. It sounds great and is easy to use for music.
3,a couple drawbacks,"I agree with most other reviewers that this MP3 player's quality and durability is ok. But here're my little gripes:1) the random setting really isn't random. It keeps playing the same sequence of songs over and over again, so after awhile, it's no longer random. Sure, you can put in about 30 songs w/o additional card, but even then, the songs get old fast.2) the belt clip is fine for walking around, but for rigorous exercise, it'll fall off. Invest in some sort of velcro band for around your arm."
3,"Cheap, relatively easy level","I was creating a built up garden on a gentle slope and I wanted to level the posts. It was great, but I guess I had more slope than I thought - I could have used 3' of tubing on either end. The short tubing resulted in a lot of back and forth and refilling/emptying to find the level. I suggest 2 people work together and it would be much simpler."
1,There are better choices out there.,"This book is a terrible resource on designing web pages. I suppose if you wanted your site to look like every other pitiful GeoCities site out there, then you could find a use for this book. However, as far as web designing in general, there are MUCH better options. Mr. Sawyer clearly does not have a good understanding of how to create a well designed web site. (By the way, Mr. Sawyer...""web site"" is two words.) The book was a complete waste of my time and money and I would encourage anyone interested in making a web site on GeoCities (or preferably anywhere else) to pick up one of numerous other books on web design."
1,product too old,"the book was printed in 1999, so all of the information i needed about geocities was way outdated. product sucked"
2,Poor Performer,"My $5.00 cheap plastic oscillating sprinkler works better than this one. While it is of nice, solid metal construction and has some interesting features, the actual sprinkling area is about half of what is depicted in the promotional materials. I thought maybe that it was just poor water pressure because it was hot and lots of folks were sprinkling at that time, but I switched to my cheap one and that worked great - covered twice the area as this one. And, yes, I did have it on the setting to cover the largest area. I guess you don't always get what you pay for."
1,Quit Oscillating - Didn't Even Work 1 day!!!,"I purchased 2 of the Nelson Triple Spray sprinklers to water our newly seed lawn. This sprinkler was highly recommended to me by a local garden supply store. We put them out the day we seeded our lawn. The first hour was great, but then they both quit oscillating!! We live on a hill and because it stopped oscillating, our seed was washed away. Cost us over $100 to replace the seed. Disappointed!!"
1,"Nice design on the surface, but breaks too easily","While this sprinkler, like the models that preceded it, gives very good coverage, it is not durable and must be returned frequently for replacement. Various models seem to have something different break on them, but they *all* seem to stop oscillating (some after as little as a few hours' use!) and the connection from the sprinkler body to a hose is very fragile. It breaks so easily it has to leave you wondering how much more cheaply this part could have been made. However, Nelson has been very good so far about replacing their sprinklers, so other than the fact that it is a pain to keep packing them up, and pay the shipping costs, they have made good on their defective products."
4,Decent Sprinkler,"Bought this unit after ""retiring"" a worn out 20 year old underground system. Have several odd shaped small areas to water, this seems to do the job fairly well. My only complaint is that I get wet trying to adjust the spray, but this is getting better with practice."
4,Extremely Helpful,"I lost my father this past December and has always been the type of person who would read up on things going on in my life. I felt like a needed something to explain what I was feeling since I was unable to explain it myself. The author of this book was able to break down how I was feeling and put it into terms that I was able to connect with. I fully recommend this book, it really is helping me through this rough time!"
1,not worth a dime,PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY ON YHIS THIN PAPERBACK. I BOUGHT THIS AFTER MY HUSBAND DIED. IT WAS NOT WORTH A DIME AND SHOULD'T BE IN PRINT. I WAS LOOKING FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION THAN WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND IN THE NEWSPAPER.
3,works but not for me,This took my hair out. I had no hair loss until I started vitex. I thought it was just this brand but its vitex.
2,poor finish,did not receive the color I had ordered but kept product anyway. Finish is peeling off in water bowls.
5,American Doctors Corrupt Freud,"The review by D. Smitherman is dead accurate. I would add only that Bettelheim touches on how American physicians and clinicians ""inserted"" (to use Bettleheim's term) notions of psychoanalysis to be used as a tool for social conformity. Freud thought American culture sick and narcissistic, and didn't believe that social conformity or adaptation was an appropriate use of psychoanalysis. He also didn't believe in any requirement that professionals should be sole practitioners of psychoanalysis. In fact, he wished for an army of trained lay-people to do this work of the soul. As a consumer/survivor, that was all a revelation to me, and redemptive of Freud."
3,PACKAGED BETTER IN THE UA COLLECTION,"THESE TWO ALBUMS ARE GOOD, SOLID GORD! Worthy of 4 stars. I just knocked it down to 3 stars, because you can save your money and get the UA COLLECTION that has these same 2 albums AS WELL AS the albums ""Did She Mention My Name"" and ""Back Here On Earth"".So go see the reviews for the UA Collection. If you just want this one because of the album cover, then fine; pick it up."
5,Iconic Canadian Folk Balladeer,Indelible word pictures combined wit virtuoso guitar and top notch studio help make this a fine addition to a music collection. A lot of great listening here.
5,Excellent intro to microeconomics,"This is a great text for an intro to Microeconomics (I used this book when I was student). It was written clearly by stating the points that the author hopes you learn, followed by the reading and then exercises and problems to make sure the student understood the concepts from the chapter. The many graphs in this book make the concepts easy to understand and the fact that most of the graphs are in color helps out alot."
4,good for textbook but the cost is over the top,"The text is good, easy to read can as current as a textbook can be. The examples are good. That is not what I feel is a problem. The cost for a paperback; my god, is more then $100. I have had to control my gag reflect when I think of that. The cost should be around $40 at most. There are other books that cover the same material that could pass as text, but when the instructor say -- Colander, Colander it is.The cost of this text is the driver for e-textbook -- the publisher will lose, the authors will lose. Why? Their greed and the ""invisible hand"" will take control."
1,"got the book, wasnt fully impressed","shipping was ok. wasnt as descriptive about the book, it had a lot of water damage and was a little bit more expensive than what it should be priced at. i bought other books with descriptions more detailed and when i received the books, i was shocked at how much damage there wasnt on the books. overall i got the cheapest book available and wasnt impressed as much as i have from other cheap purchases."
4,Tribal goodness,"Though the songs are completely varying (Track 4 blends city traffic and rap; Track 7 is some eastern-sounding harp instrument), they all have a very exotic, trance-like appeal which is perfect for meditation, ritual work, or stalled rush hour traffic. If you aren't a trance or tribal music fan, avoid this album, but it has some great variety and awesome melodic and percussion textures!"
3,Very good for HTPC but not recommended for home studios,"If you need a inexpensive home theater PC speakers MS40 are fun. Their mids and highs are sweet e the mid-bass line is satisfatory. Those ones who intend to listen to MP3 and watch movies on PCs will enjoy MS40.On other hand, if you need a reference monitor for recordings, forget it! No way! MS40 is quite uneven, lacks resolution and clarity on mid band and its treble has absolutely no resolution. Bass lines isn't good enough also, because of its lack of control and velocity (they are boomy speakers). Their quite apparent boxiness also let MS40 down.Looking for a entry level reference monitor? I would recommend to spend a bit more and get KRK Rockit RP5G2 or a M-Audio BX5A. They cost twice as much, but sound 4 times better. You can't afford any of them as your budget is short, so go with M-Audio AV30 or AV40. In my opinion, even the chep M-Audio AV20 offers better mid and treble resolution than behringer MS40."
3,behringer Digital Monitor Speakers,"The sound quality is passable. But for the price what do you expect. I have a pair of M audio studiophile DX4 speakers and they have better sound quality. They cost 149.99 so the extra 20 bucks is well worth it. When i recieved my order it didn't even come with the wire to hook up both speakers so try not to go through american musical supply. They were however good in customer service and they sent me the extra wire free of charge. It just took a week. Overall the behringer speakers are decent, but seriously just spend the extra 20 and get M audio studiophile DX4's."
3,A bit disappointed.,"Was hoping these speakers would work good on our new LCD TV which only had a optical audio out. They work but the bass has a cardboard sound and the highs a bit shrill. The GF likes them so I guess we will keep them. A 5 band equalizer on the main speaker would help matters greatly, to shape the sound to the room."
5,plenty of power,with this pair of 40 watt self powered speakers I was able to balance out the various music tracks on a video. Making playback smooth and enjoyable for the viewers
2,Nice...If You Don't Mind Hum and Hiss,"I had high hopes for these studio reference monitors, but I was sorely disappointed. Even with no inputs connected, nothing connected but power, if the bass knob was anywhere above zero, there was a constant hum; not loud, but there. I couldn't take it. And if that wasn't enough, the tweeters emitted a constant hiss; again, barely noticeable, but noticeable. And again, this is with no inputs connected, so you can't blame the analog inputs. I thought maybe I got a bad set, so I exchange them for another...Same problems. It is nice that these speakers have the inputs that they do, and the dual volume knobs. They do have a nice sound when there should be sound. Unfortunately, they also have a sound when there should not be any.I do highly recommend American Musical Supply. They were very helpful and I never paid any shipping even after buying these speakers, exchanging them, and then returning them for a full refund."
3,Behringer Speaker MS40,I could say these was a good buy for a bingeing engineer it's a tone djing with them is very fun. Digital Monitor Speakers.
3,Hoped they sounded better,"I bought these monitors and have them returned due to the right speaker rattling with low frequencies at 60% of volume default bass and treble levels. I was hoping this would be a great product. I was only disappointed after receiving my second pair; they had the same rattling sound on the very same speaker. I can't find speakers with the same features at this price.I could give it more stars because everything else is just about perfect, excellent sound in mids and highs, bass could be lower but you can't ask that much from 4.75"" cones.For me, it's more than flipping a coin when ordering this. Two in a row has to say something."
2,Look something else,"I like how it looked on picture, and hope if I connect from sound card via optical cable will get good quality. :)Any sound via optical cable ""toslink""(or copper digital cable), shorter than 1 second duration starts from static :(192 kHz via optical cable ""toslink"" not worksSupport - slow(1 reply in 2,3 days), recommended repair center which had horrible reputation on internet :)"
3,Behriger Speaker MS40,I wasn't really impressed. I have a little Dj studio and these speakers couldn't keep up. I think they are more for a PC and not for a studio!
2,Neither here nor there,"I was not sure if the main theme of the book was romance or life in Cuba. It is fine to try to have a romance set in Cuba or telling the story of life in Cuba through a love story but in the end, it felt neither here nor there. I have not been to Cuba and so I can't comment on the authencity of the author's description of the country. As for the love story, I was not entirely sure what Richard and Lourdes saw in each other to fall in love. Their so-called love felt a little superficial and unconvincing. Richard always seemed impatient to have sex with Lourdes. He just appeared to me as someone not sure about what he wants and afraid to confront what he wants. In comparison, Lourdes was pretty single-minded about what she wanted. The ending was up to anybody's interpretation, was it a sad story or not? Maybe the tragedy was about Lourdes' hope that love could overcome any obstacles and Richard's skepticism about love and trust, just disillusion and regret in the end."
2,Just Ok...,"An interesting peek into modern life in Cuba, but the actual ""love story"" was weak and hard to get in to. I hardly cared what became of the main characters in the end. I enjoyed the descriptions of Cuba and her people and it appeared to be a good education on life in Cuba today."
1,anticlamatic bore,"i was in thailand for a couple months and thought this would be a good book to go with the traveling--- was that wrong. this horribily written, scattered, drab novel is not one which you should waste your time on.what was with the ending anyway?such a waste..."
2,"OK descriptive and psychological, bad on the political","Iyer's descriptions of place are visually satisfying; the psychology of the love story is interesting and convincing tho the writing stumbled into repetition. However he depicts Cuba as a place of hopelessness - for which Castro, not the embargo , is blamed; and where people fear jail for even speaking English - tho Cuba has less people incarcerated per capita than any other nation in the americas. Speaking English was no problem for a friend recently returned from Cuba. I think this book is harmfully misleading."
4,"A gray, dreary read of a Terrifically Vibrant Country","This book reads like one of those foriegn 'art' films where you follow people agonizing through everyday life but nothing much ever happens - you wait for hours for a flat, non-ending. Oh well, you got through it. Protagonist Richard is an adrenaline junkie global news photographer, who seems to feel deeply but never really gets past his hornmones or intellectualizing everything, including his 'love affair' with Lourdes. He is actually a very shallow person (sort of like an unfunny Seinfeld character - there is no humor in the book). It is a credit to Pico Iyer's talent that I could read this entire book and still think the trip was worth it, sort of. Nihilistic, full of angst and dreary images of life in Cuba of the early '90s.What haunts me is the real implication of what the USA's 40-y embargo has wraught on the citizens of Cuba. Very Sad."
3,"A real account of life in Castros Cuba,","Having spent two years in Cuba recently, I found Mr. Iyers book very accurate in as much as his descriptions and dialogues were true to form. His portrayals of the people and their life are on the money. The plot of the story though took a while to develop if ever. But read this book if you want to fell what it's like for the Cuban people, and how they must constantly be looking over their shoulder, forget about whether the plot works."
5,A Great Read!,"I read this book to my two children, ages 7 and 5. We all very much enjoyed it. I may have enjoyed it more then they did! Some childrens books are so much alike you get tired of the same old story told different ways. Sometimes, as a parent, you get tired of reading the same book over and over - EXCEPT for the classics. This book is sure to be a classic. The illustrations are BEAUTIFUL and unlike anything I've ever seen. I highly recommend it - if you have children or not!"
5,"Fanciful, magical bedtime story...","My children love this beautifully illustrated nighttime tale by artist Dar Hosta! The story is both captivating and instructive, allowing children of all ages to learn more about nocturnal creatures, and the accompanying illustrations are lovely to look at. A great find and highly recommended."
4,reggie is an inspiration,"it's a great book and a super deal. more exposure to reggie gold is a wonderful thing. the only negative to this book is that, joe strauss is a very opinionated writer and his voice comes through a little too much some times for a biography."
1,Terrible Radar Detector,"I drove around for an entire month with this radar detector and it never went off. I commute a 4 hour drive most every weekend. I would pass cops over and over and I know that some of them were using their radar. This detector never made a sound with the exception of when I turned it on and off. It did not even sound in front of grocery stores where most every radar detector I've ever owned went off because of the electric doors. I would not recommend buying this product. Defective or not, it's not worth the risk of getting a ticket with this non-functional radar detector..... Spend a little more and get a better quality product."
1,Missed almost all police cars,"I have heard awesome things about the company and their detectors. I'm actually going to buy/ try another model.This model does not work well. I tried it out for about 3 weeks, and it did not detect any police cars. I know that some may not have had their radars on and pointed, but missing 5-7 cars is not acceptable to me. Don't waste your time with this model."
3,Good for the price,"Good price for a product of its performance, And using a longer power cable will be a plus for drivers of minivan..."
1,green bay controller,"the controller arrived quickly, but when my son first tried to use it (on Christmas Day) the left trigger button on the back of the controller was non-functional. We tried to reset the controller, but nothing appears to work. NOW, we can't figure out how to contact Amazon to see about returning it--and it looks like we can't return it anyway, because in order to use it you have to take it out of the packaging...and the rules say that items cannot be returned unless they're unopened...so we spent $40 for a piece of junk!!"
1,Worked for only 2 days,I bought two of these XBox controllers and either one of them worked two days after the kids started using them.Would not buy one again because I have no idea where to return them.
3,Debut Weasel,"Screeching Weasel has been one of my favorite band for years. Probally the only other bands I've listened to longer was Greenday and The Queers. S.W were around for a long time, from 1987-88,91-01. They released so many great pop-punk records. My Brain Hurts and Bark Like a Dog are their best.This record is really not that bad, honest. The first 27 songs are their bebut album. There loud and fast. Most of songs are only like 45 seconds long. All the songs pretty much sound the same. These songs are what you expect for a 19 year-old to write about. The tracks 28-39 are demo's from their next record boogodaboogadaboogada!"
2,Good Blind when deployed... but...,This is a good blind once deployed but I was disappointed to discover that the stake poles do not fold and they are not sharp. They are simple lengths of fiberglass with blunt ends. So if the ground is at all hard you will struggle to get this into the ground. Also if you are backpacking in as we do when turkey hunting the poles are too long to easily fit into your backpack. This is just a so so product. I would not recommend and I think I will return it.
1,Gauze pads,The Curad gauze pads are very thin and minamally absorbent. They do not provide the protection I need. Both Kroger and Johnson & Johnson provide a much better guaze pad but are slightly more expensive. I will not buy Curad pads again.
1,"Boring, dull full of hot air","What was BW trying to achieve with this book, leaves a reader dis satisfied, their is no continuity in the book and sometimes it seems like several people have written the book, to me it seems like B.W. and several of his underlings sat togather and wrote this book in a single day"
3,Largely anecdotal,"While clearly the author has substantial experience in the field, I was largely disappointed by the lack of empirical support of his conclusions. It would have been helpful to move beyond the experiential realm and into more fact based conclusions. Nonetheless, it makes for a good review of some interesting transactions with which the author is quite familiar."
2,Bankers are full of hot gasses.,"Somebody needs to stick a pin into Bruce Wasserstein and let out some of that hot air. This book is too long, and Wasserstein is too full of himself, to ultimately make this book readable. Want to understand what investment bankers really do? Try reading Monkey Business: Swinging Through the Wall Street Jungle. It's short, sweet, and honest."
3,Some Rather Strange Performances,"This is a sampler disc featuring selections from longer works offered on other discs. I have the Vol. 1 disc which I have enjoyed several times but this one is a different story. Although some of the performances are really good, the ballet solo from Sylvia being a case in point, some of the selections are very esoteric.I cannot really recommend this disc to anyone; the selections performed range from good to strange, the video is great but the audio has some bloated bass in a couple of selections that had me checking my speaker calibration all over again (the calibration checked out which led to me believe the bloat was on the disc).If the selections interest you the price is low enough to minimize the risk but I'll admit it will be a long time before I put that disc on again."
5,get back to basics in Faith,"This is not a name and claim book, this is truth, back to basics of sowing and reaping, believing for a miracle.In the simplest form, the way Jesus meant for you. At my church we have been buying these up and passing them on to one another.Thank You Oral Roberts! the seeds you planted so long ago are still producing, and your harvest is in heaven."
3,Easy to read,"Easy to read, short some forms that are required, and doesn't answers enough question, so be ready to consult an attorney. It was handy to have though, and worth the costs. It pointed me in the right direction, and saved me thousands."
4,Nice book for kids and adults,"Great illustrations, a little strangely categorized, but a nice book to keep on hand while combing the shore and identifying creatures."
1,A masterpiece? Really?,"It reminded me of what Lord Tennyson said about Ben Jonson: ""Reading him is like wading through glue."" I have reached an age when I am not willing to make heroic efforts to get bored. Sorry."
2,Why that title?,"Why is it that the title of this book in English is Three TRAPPED Tigers? It should be Three SAD Tigers! Please, there is a long distance in any language between trapped and sad.If that is the title, I would hate to read the rest of the translation."
2,First Impressions,"I haven't done anything more than open the cover and flick through yet, so I can't comment on the general content. What drove me to write this review however, is that many of the Java code fragments detailed are incorrect. In some cases, they won't compile, in others they just don't do what it is claimed that they do. The technical editor should really have done a better job of ensuring accuracy. If I can't trust the bits I do have expertise in, how can I trust the information on areas in which I don't?"
3,One man's view on how to improve America.,"Gingrich's ideas are common sense. Americans have to take responsibility for themselves and stop playing the part of victim. As a victim, they ask the government for benefits because of their victimhood. If they take responsibility, they need to strive to improve themselves through education and other methods. That said, I don't know if I am in accord with all his principles. Government needs to help those who either cannot or will not help themselves. I think Gingrich equates that with the Big Brother concept of government. If it were up to Gingrich, many people who have relied on the government for their living would be thrown out on the streets. I don't think that is the answer either.As a moderate Republican, I don't subscribe to all Gingrich beliefs. He is at the far right of the Republican Party and I was happy to see him replaced as the House Speaker. I think some of his views are common sense, and some are right wing. The tape was an average listen."
5,this book helped me get a great body!,"I've been working out quite a lot and have been slow to achieve results. when i started using this book I sort of gave up the dieting and the workouts and had this ""what the hell, I'll just try it out"" sort of attitude. Well, I have to say that my figure has gotten much much better with these exercises. I found it really easy to understand the exercises and I can do them in front of the TV at times as well. This is a great book! I highly recommend it!"
3,Great content--Very poor quality binding,"I am really getting a lot from the content of this book; the exercises are fun and very effective. But at the same time I'm so disappointed in its quality--I've only had it a few days and almost all the pages have come loose. To use a book like this one must hold it open, turn pages back and forth, etc.; in other words, it should be made to be handled. This is not."
5,Yard Butler,Great for watering trees. But I had to drill two holes on the side to get the water to spread out even.
3,"Yard butler, not as I had hoped","I had previously used a root irrigator that had holes on the sides of the rod and wasn't able to tell how this was designed before the purchase. Unfortunately, it only has one hole it and is at the end and points downward. The downfall is, when you're pushing the yard butler into the ground, it becomes clogged with dirt and isn't functional until you pull it back out and clean it out. I solved the problem by drilling holes in the side of it to irrigate trees without the hassle of having to unclog it over-and-over. It serves it's purpose with some additional work, would recommend buying one with holes in the side, not the bottom."
4,ROOT WATERER,GREAT PRODUCT. I DID HAVE PROBLEM WITH THE HOLE IN THE END PLUGGING UP WHEN INSERTING IT INTO THE GROUND. I ENLARGED THE HOLE AND DRILLED TWO HOLES IN THE SIDE AND IT WORKS GREAT
2,Not what I had hoped....,"I really wanted to like this product. My dad had one very much like this that he used for more than 30 years, but it had holes on the sides of the spike, and not one hole at the bottom/end like this does. The problem is that as soon as I pushed the irrigator into the ground, it got plugged up with dirt and small pebbles so no water would come out. If the holes were on the sides, this would not be a problem. I know that there are irrigators out there with the holes in the side, and I would recommend that you look for one of those models."
3,"Pretty Good, but not perfect","I read the reviews prior to purchasing this tool, so I think I knew what to expect. When it arrived, I was excited to get it to use. I found that there was a piece of wood jammed into the tip which prevented water from flowing at all. It was easy to dislodge with a small tool, and put the hose on the bottom and flushed the wood out the hose connection.The tool does put water into the ground. I would absolutely agree with a couple of the suggestions on other reviews. You will be best served to drill a couple of holes into the side of the shaft. This will reduce the pressure of the water coming out, but that water was not able to dig any holes in my yard. To be fair, I have pretty rocky soil, so maybe it would work with a better soil. I went by Lowe's and picked up a piece of reinforcing iron (rebar would work fine), and hammered that bar into the ground to make the hole. When I put the root irrigator into that hole the water flows."
4,Does the work with modifications.,"I used one ages ago and yes it had holes on the side.. I have not seen any that really works, You need the ""T"" handle to get this down in dry dirt. As far as the holes, drill a few and it is perfect.I also have the various bags and rings where you have to haul and set up, then fill the bag. Thius unit you just turn on the hose and come back 30 minutes later."
3,Good but Leaks,"This waterer does what it says it will. It does spray out of the joint where the handle and rod are joined. I think it is a design flaw, not a shipping issue. I don't like this, but the other waterers I found of this style are $100s of dollars."
3,yard butler wst-1 tree watering tool,"Ordered this because of severe drought in my area. Fast shipping. Talked to tree expert and his recommendation was a soaker hose placed around tree drip line and moving it around. Might work for small trees and shrubs,flower beds not for large areas."
4,Water Butler for N. Texas (triple digit hell),Recommend using a 5d or smaller nail to keep tip clear. Push about 5-6 inches at a time and withdraw to keep tip clear until desired depth is reached. Product is 5 star quality. 4 stars were given because I don't know tree response yet. Highly recommend.
2,Faulty Design,"The Yard Butler is a poorly made tree watering tool compared to Ross. With the drought and the recall on the Ross tool for its cap that pops off I didn't have much of a choice. The one hole for water at the bottom of the tool is a poor design that clogs easily, even when you put it into the ground as the directions indicate. To make it function much better I drilled holes on the side of the tube to do a quicker and more thorough job."
4,Dan's review of the Yard Butler WST-1 Tree Watering Tool,"I was very pleased with my tree watering tool. It is very substantial. The complaint about the tip clogging is true. I thought if I had the water going fast enough while inserting the tool in the ground I could prevent that. As with most tools, if you are sufficiently strong and stupid, you can overcome the engineering. When I slowed down how fast I was inserting the tool and slid it up and down a little, I had no more problem. I was inserting the tool into the clay soil of eastern Nebraska.My only complaint about the tool is that there is no way to add fertilizer to the tool. I doubt that my tree really needs those chemicals anyway."
4,"Sturdy, but needs holes in the sides","More than three decades ago, I remember our family having a root waterer similar to this, but with several holes at the bottom. Good luck finding one like that - this was the closest I could find. So, I modified this one by drilling all the way through about 2"" and 4"" from the tip and then at a 90 degree angle from that two more holes all the way through at about 3"" and 5"" from the tip (so, I added 8 holes). I wanted to use this primarily as a yard aerator and secondarily as a tree root waterer for dry years. It is simple and sturdy, and with my additional holes has worked well for my purposes."
3,Yard Butler,"I'm sure this product will be suitable for soft ground, but here in the Arizona dessert where we have hard, rocky, caliche soil, the tool cannot be easily sunk into the ground. I find it useless unless I use a 3/4"" solid steel pointed rod and a sledge hammer to first open up a hole to insert the Yard Butler. This extra step makes it more labor intensive than I had hoped."
4,Sturdy,Only had this 1 month but it looks tough and works great! We did drill a few additional holes on the sides but that was just our preference. Luckily it didn't seem to affect the pressure at all.
4,root feeder single rod,unit works well and seems strong enough if it doesn't rust out. I push it in gentley and then pull it back so as not to clog the hole in the end.
5,Yard Butler root feeders,I got the order in 3 days; was most happy to get it. They work beautifully and let me irrigate my tree roots instead of trying to get water all way down the roots in this terribly dry year. Thank you so much!
5,My favorite of Joao's live recordings.,"My second favorite is Live in Montreux. I just listened to Joao's new one Live in Tokyo and I must say, this album -Ao Vivo- is far superior, not in recording quality (although it's really good) but in FEELING. It's what they call the ""beautiful sadness"". I listened to it when I was really down and out, and it seemed to me that Joao was like a benevolent angel- consoling me, with Portugese lyrics I couldn't understand! That's the power of music!"
5,The Cycad Growers'Bible.,"This book is superb. David Jones has a passion for these fascinating plants and this shines through on every page of this excellent book. Every aspect of the biology, cultural significance, aesthetic value and cultivation requirements of cycads are presented in an accessible but comprehensive style. The book abounds with fascinating information including detailed distribution maps and conservation status, and is wonderfully illustrated with photographs and line illustrations. I cannot praise this book too highly, and if you are thinking of purchasing a book on the subject it has to be this one. I would advise against buying any book that covers both palms and cycads as they are very different plants and, inevitably, the cycads will miss out."
1,Dont waste your money.,I just purchased one of these and I am amazed how poorly things are being built now. If stopping every minute to rewind the line is what you want here is your trimmer.
1,Junk,"Don't waste your money, line spool capacity not good, replacing line difficult. You will get about 10 minutes of work before you have to replace the line. I have use mine for the first time, 20 minutes of use, 30 minutes on line relacement--no need to send it back---I just gave it to my local charity"
3,TRIMMER REVIEW,"A GOOD PRODUCT, EASY TO START, PLENTY OF POWER HOWEVER A BIT OUT OF BALANCE, SHAFT COULD BE ABOUT SIX INCHES LONGER AND A BETTER BUMP HEAD THAT SCREWS ON SO IT COULD BE REPLACED WHEN NEEDED."
4,Troy Bilt Gas Powered Trimmer (#41BDT654G966),"Amazon provided customarily excellent service, delivering the trimmer in a very short time. The recoil starter takes some getting used to, but works well. The engine seems to require a long warm up to run smoothly, but that might just be due to a needed break in period. The bump feeder on the trimmer line doesn't feed well, so there are lots of "" turn off the motor, adjust the line, restart the motor, feed the line"" pauses.This unit replaces a 6 year old Craftsman trimmer that had to be retired, and a 50cc Echo trimmer that was awesome but just too big. All in all the Troy-Bilt trimmer comes in third out of three, ranking the performance of these machines."
1,Junk,"It worked well initially, but problems started as soon as the first spool of line ran out. Every time I need more line, I had to shut off the trimmer, unscrew the bump head, and manually pull out the line. Now it isn't running at all because the fuel line fell off, then after putting it back on, the fuel ran out of the carb and didn't get to the spark plug. I have been tempted on many occasions to toss this thing into the woods. I'm very disappointed with Troy-Bilt."
3,False Information,"Editorial Review - ""Ride the Desperado and feel the white-knuckled terror generated by its terrifying 280-foot drop."" It's hard for me to think much of a DVD that adds 60 extra feet to the drop of a ride. The better roller coaster documentaries give the real facts and not sloppy assumptions."
2,Humdrum comic,"The setting for this series is a re-telling of the immediate events that led Frank Castle to become the Punisher following the tragic killing of his family. Fans of the Punisher are well-aware of these facts. Re-telling and repeating the same with some changes in facts and trivia is just bad, bad story-telling and not innovative.The Punisher concept works best by being removed from the world of superheros. Garth Ennis understood this. It had a hardcore and edgy film noir style that is hard to beat. Here, when the Punisher interacts with Peter Parker and the Daily Bugle, it removes that intense personal world of violence that the Punisher operates within.Finally, the very crude drawings and colouring really do not help this story along. Besides the awkward anatomy, the pacing and panel arrangements are not well done. The colours are too bright and not suitable for representing the edgy world of the Punisher."
3,Not as good as I thought,"This book is much smaller than I anticipated... It's only 6 inches tall and 5 inches wide. But, that wouldn't be so bad if one picture took up a whole page, but many of the pages have 4 small animal pictures on them - much too small to capture my baby's interest. Maybe when she gets older - like 2 or 3 she'll like it??"
5,Three month old loves it!,"My three month old granddaughter loves this book. We read the names of the animals to her and talk about the colors. The pictures are bright, cheerful, and simple yet stimulating. I highly recommend it and will be buying the rest of the series."
5,"Great nails, handy case","These nails work perfectly with my DeWalt D51275K 15 gauge angled finish nailer, and the size/shape of the reuseable plastic case they come in is handy for holding extra nails in the tool belt or even your back pocket.Not mentioned in the Amazon description is the following included with the nails: ""Fits SENCO SFN1, SFN30, SFN40; AccuSet A250FN; Craftsman 18432, 18442; DeWalt D51275K; Porter-Cable DA250A."" There are 700 nails in the pack. I can't speak for the other brands, but I know the DeWalt can be finickey about nails, and it definitely likes these.I purchased my DeWalt nailer from Amazon, and at the time they were offering $25 off purchases over $199. To hit that number, the only thing I could think of was to get a variety of nails, so I added these AccuSet 2"" nails, along with a pack of 2-1/2"" nails and a pack of 1-1/2"" nails to the shopping cart. A variety of nail sizes that work good with my nailer practically for free. Can't beat that."
2,Opened package,I was a little dis-satified because the package was not taped shut. I had broken nails all over the inside of the shipping box.
4,A Great Book,"This is a terrific book for all-around beginners, but if you are an advanced composer that's just lacking game industry experience-- this book is equally as valuable. I did skip past pages here-and-there, because I already knew about a particular subject-- but I still use this book to help me through a certain business procedure or to look up a sample entertainment contract. This was definitely worth the money."
3,Rich in information but outdated,"This book contains very good and valuable information for those wanting to get into the game industry, unfortunately it was written in 2000, so most of the information is completely old for today standards, specially in this field."
4,Solid advice for composers wanting to get into the industry,"This is a great book for those composers and sound designers wanting to break into the gaming industry. I do not understand why many people read this book hoping to find technical audio information, but this is NOT a TECHNICAL AUDIO or ENGINEERING book. This book is in the same vein as Jeff Rona's Reelworld book or Richard Davis's Complete Guide to Filmscoring.Invaluable industry advice and at preparing your audio demo reels, and making connections. Must have for any aspiring game music composer or sound designer."
4,Good general guide on entering the industry,"I've been working in the field of game audio on the content side for about 5 years. I got this book as I was starting out and I found it a quick, easy read that offered alot of helpful insight and pretty much everything Marks said has held true in my experience. There are people complaining here that this book doesn't offer deep technical information or insight on how to provide content or help with audio programming and that's true. Maybe the title could have been clearer - it's more an idea of what game audio is about and what it's like to work in that field. But if that's what you're looking for, it's a quite worth reading and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to know how to break into the industry on the audio side."
3,Misleading product picture!,For less than $20 this costume is ok. Do not believe the product picture though. It's quite misleading. The headress came with 4 feathers. FOUR. My wife added several more with a glue gun to make the headress less pathetic looking. Other than that the costume is ok.
5,No problems here.,"This was just the right book to help with my mother's grand garden plans, with lots of helpful illustrations. Satisfied with this selection."
2,Don't Bother,"Ok now I'm mad I recently bought this antenna from Home Depot about 2 days ago and paid $14.97, $16.06 w/tax and its on here for $8 what a waste. This antenna is really not worth it. The little circle is supposed to increase reception but didn't do much. After adjusting the antennas & circle in every position imaginable the channels were still not viewable. The picture colors were off & it showed double images. The sad part is I recently moved and couldn't find my old antenna so I decided to go by a new one instead of searching for the old one. I found the old one in a moving bag this morning & 1 of the antennas had been broken off I stuck it back on & that old broken down antenna works better than this one!"
3,MillenniumReview,"I was looking for this to go with my digital tv converter. However, the signal I got wasn't the best I was looking for. Normal antennae for analog is ok."
1,This sucks.,"I couldn't get any signal, it may have been my fault but I tried to get it working by following the directions and it sucked."
5,Ideal shoe for my purposes,"I've been wearing this shoe while riding on the road for more than a year, with complete satisfaction. So far as I know it is the ONLY shoe designed specifically for road-riding with SPD pedals. Most people use mountain-bike shoes with SPDs on the road, but those tend to be heavier, and the lugs track dirt and mud into the house, restaurant, wherever. This shoe has a stiff, flat, non-lugged sole that works just fine. It's comfortable walking around in, certainly more so than road-pedal shoes designed for Look-type pedals. I wouldn't go hiking in them, but that's just about the only limitation.When mine wear out I'll buy another pair, unless some other manufacturer wises up to the fact that a sizable percentage of SPD pedals are used on road bikes exclusively!"
2,There are much better ones,"Overly pompous and majestic, this recording of the B minor mass doesn't come anywhere close to the other two I've listened a lot to recently: Marriner on Philips and Gardiner on Archiv. (Both highly recommended.) Karajan's reindition lacks clarity and pace, and -- which is worse -- a true understanding of the work's religious nature. It just becomes another showpiece for a prolific conductor with his all-star soloists, and the end result is bland, uninteresting and, above all, fails to stir up any deeper emotions whatsoever."
2,Don't buy this one.,"Man oh man. This is pretty bad. All I'm going to comment on right here is the tenors. They like to sing loud and they don't like to sing on pitch and they don't like to sing with the other parts or the orchestra, let alone the conductor... Definitely pick another recording if you want the B Minor Mass."
5,Great group of songs!,"I was delighted to buy this a while back on another site (where you get better pricing than amazon!) - the amazon price seems too high!This double album includes 20 tracks, a great compilation for any new Kobukuro fans.These are the tracks:1. Kimi toiu na no Tsubasa2. Anata e to Tsuduku Michi3. Koko ni Shika Sakanai Hana4. Maiasa, Boku no Yoko ni Ite5. Million Films6. Eien ni Tomo ni7. blue blue8. Takarajima9. Yuki no Furanaimachi10. Negai no Uta1. Kaze2. YOU3. miss you4. YELL5. Bell6. Wadachi7. DOOR ~ The knock again ~8. Taiyou9. Sakura10. Mirai e no Kaerimichi"
4,What I expected,The book arrived in a timely fashion and was the same as the description advertised.
1,"Stupid, Stupid Mock Up","You could definitely tell that Stehpen Speilberg had his hand in this! Several times during the movie I began humming either the ""Star Wars"" theme or the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" music. There are SO many bits taken from both movies it's unreal! But the biggest problem with movie is it is not funny at all. I don't get why there were all those five star reviews (one of them must have a lot of relatives!), but it is a very mediocre movie at best. I wouldn't waste my time on it."
1,Don't Even Think About It!,This seemed like a good choice based upon other reviews. It was not! I hope you will select something else-anything else.
2,easily amused,If you liked this movie then I can only say one thing and that is you are easily amused. At best this is a mediocre flick.
4,This is one of my top ten favorites but,"I love this movie, but it is not family friendly! It contains fowl language, simulated sex and nudity.Russell is a car salesman that has to take over the store when his boss dies and the bosses twin brother (a bad guy) wants to take over. Turns out that the boss had a daughter who just shows up and the fun begins. Take out the nudity and sex, and this has all the look and feel of a Herbie the Love Bug type of Disney movie that would have found an audience for those seeking family friendly offerings.A 5 star movie if edited, down-graded to 4 stars as is."
5,Very Funny yet typical stereotype of car salesmen.,"Though I'd like to see the stereotype of car sales people change I dont believe that will happen any time soon. It is nice to continue to find humor in their behaviors on screen and off. Curt Russell is ""laugh yourself silly"" with his big hair and fun clothes. I would recommend this movie to everyone and encourage (if you like stronger language) both ""Suckers"" on DVD and ""Cars and People, pissing at 60 miles an hour"" by Anthony Ziegler a novella."
3,Okay,You will probably only purchase this movie if you've seen it somewhere before. My boyfriend hadn't seen it so I purchased it for him to watch. He enjoyed it but probably not one we'll watch often. Not a movie with small children around since there's some nudity.
4,Top 5 Guilty Pleasure Films of All Time,"Simply put, this is one of the funniest movies I've ever laughed out loud over, time and time again. Just say the words, ""Sheriff Lucky"" and ""high prices"" to anyone who has ever watched 'Used Cars', and wait for the reaction. I'm really looking forward to listening to the commentary on this DVD, as I've only seen the film on VHS, and have nearly worn two copies of it completely out. Appearances by Michael McKean and David Lander (Lenny & Squiggy) as a couple of techno-geeks, and The Munsters' Al Lewis as a hanging judge, are among the innumerable small bonuses this movie has to offer. As Kurt Russell's character would say, ""Trust me!"" - this movie will be high on your list of Guilty Pleasures, too."
5,Fell out of the back seat laughing!,"On the one hand _Used Cars_ is nearly 20 years old, and it's chock-full of sleazy humor you wouldn't want to describe around your kids. But those things don't make it a bad movie; if you're in the mood for a fast-paced low comedy, long on gags and short on deep PC messages, this is the one to grab. (Most memorable scene: the commercial that jammed a Presidential address, with Roy dressed as a cowboy and shooting price stickers on the cars. ""Is this a 1977 Mercedes 450 SL for TWENTY-FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS?!? That's TOO [bleeping] HIGH!"")"
5,"""We blew the @#%& out of that over priced muter@#$%"" and made a funny funny movie at the same time","Ouch, my sides still ache just thinking about this crass, profane, over the top comedy for ADULTS(it's rated ""R"" for a reason)and i'll watch it many more times before i die. Kurt Russell(fresh off the ""Elvis"" T.V. movie) SHINES and along with Jack Warden(the slimiest and funniest bad guy ever) rules over this movie like a con-artist king as they one up each other in the slime they use to sell the worst cars to ever grace the screen. Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale(Back to the Future)go for every sick joke they can and find most of them in glorious fashion. From ""R"" rated ads for T.V.(take that Janet Jackson) to useing dead bodies to reach their goals(you have to watch to find out how) this is one of the funniest movies made in the 80's or ever."
4,"Not Ani any more... but then, neither is Ani!","It is true, people have always compared Tanya Janca favourably to Ani DiFranco, but where the righteous babe may have lost her edge in recent releases, Tanya has lost none of hers'. If you are an adherent to Michael Moore's political bent, then the tune; ""Bush Can Eat My Bush"" alone is worth the price of this CD! Indeed, with so many artists now lining up on the Left, none of their opportunistic writings match this song for the clarity of the point made. This CD also has some pop-ish items on it, but the lyrics are always incisive and the playing crisp. For a typical indie release, the overall package is of professional quality and the liner artwork is amazing! In all, a worthwhile buy."
1,Older than dust,"The hardware (computers, cameras, scanners, etc.) and software (OS's and bitmap editors) used in this book are antiquarian and for the most part no longer available. The techniques are also for the most part out dated due to new features in the latest software versions such as contained Photoshop 7. This book is useful only to someone running Photoshop 3 on MAC OS 7 or Windows 98 with 64 MB of RAMwith 1GB drives."
1,you wouldn't want to buy this book!,"This historical fiction picture book is meant to be humorous but fails miserably. Instead, it offers tired and racist stereotypes of native americans, complete with insulting illustrations of native americans with enormous noses, pot bellies and war paint. Buy this book only if you need a good example of stereotyping in children's books."
2,Heritage/Patrimonio,This book is a real disappointment. How many facts can a writer cram on a page? It is really not a readable book.
2,Bag Pipe Music,"Disappointing, but I guess that is what bagpipe music (loud and grating) is supposed to be.Didn't the Scots use bagpipes to scare the English in battles?"
3,UGGH......,"Okay....not a bad product in or of itself. However, it was plastic and snaller than I envisioned but then again, I should have taken more notice of the dimensions. It looks good once you actually put it together but OMG..I almost broke my thumbs trying to fit the supporting legs inside the basket. It took two of us to actually piece this together.Now that it's done, I can honestly say that if I ever need a laundry hamper again..I will go to an actual store and buy one that doesn't have to be put together in any way, shape or form!"
3,Incredibly difficult to assemble!,"The product decription says it is easy to assemble. Not even close. I tried to put it together by myself and it was an impossible task. My husband (who is a bodybuilder) had to help me and we struggled for 10 minutes trying to put the legs in their positions. The finished product is great, but just like the previous reviewer, I'd go to the store and buy an already assembled one next time."
1,POS!!,"This came in the tiniest box. never in my wildest dreams would I have guessed there was a hamper in there. ""easy to set up"" to me meant attach the top or put some feet on. This ""hamper"" came squashed down like an accordian, 5"" thick and you are supposed to pull it out straight and tall and stick these PLASTIC legs into the inside of each corner. I move heavy gear for a living but let me tell you, there is no way in the world i can get those ""legs"" in. The ""hamper"" is sitting in the corner unusable. The trash service came today and took the packaging or it would be going right back. IF I can get it together.....It might be big enough for 2 towels. Don't waste your money!!"
3,Hamper,"Very nice.I like that the dirty clothes can breathe with the open bottom (not open,but kind of)can't explain it.I like it"
3,False advertising,"This hamper is NOT wicker. It is instead ""woven polypropylene"" that ""gives you the feeling of natural wicker"". The Amazon heading for this product and the wording on the packaging itself is extremely misleading. Again, this hamper is NOT wicker. Just wanted to make that clear.I purchased this hamper in white for my baby girl's room and only decided to keep it because the price is right (actual wicker would cost more, of course).For those of you whining about the assembly, give me a break! I put this together in 3 minutes and I'm 8.5 months pregnant, 5'1"" with a pre-pregnancy weight of 107 and my baby is measuring larger than average. I haven't been to the gym since March. Really, it is not THAT difficult."
1,Just sat there,"I threw this at my cats to play with and they completely ignored it. Whatever amount of catnip it is supposed to have must be extremely minimal, because it elicited no reaction at all.Feb 21- I am now updating my review. I now give it 3 stars because one cat does enjoy sitting and licking the toys little head."
1,Horrible! A Two Year Old Could Play Better!,"I would say I've heard worse, but this beats the cake! What kind of drugs is he on here? You may have to get drugged up to listen to this album because otherwise it's pretty hard to listen to. The only good cut on here is ""Kissaround"" but that was released as a JMC single. So WTF? I can really see why this CD was discontinued from the manufacturer! Don't waste your money unless your VERY curious. You'll listen to it once, rip the 1 song you want (which you can probably find free off the internet somewhere), then it will collect dust forever. This Album just sounds like a big ""warm up session"" through and through into each song...tuning guitars, noises, mumbling, some feedback, and anything a 2 year old could do with a toy guitar, amp, and plastic toy microphone. Sad! Smoke a big doobie before playing this...you'll probably need it."
3,Much Better Options Out There,"This is not a fabulous cookbook. I have made several recipes from it and not been impressed with many of them. There are also typos. The recipe for zucchini bread called for one tablespoon of baking soda. While I should have known this was wrong, I trusted the recipe. It came out absolutely dreadful and inedible. Also, the granola recipe (which comes out soggy not crunchy)indicates that it has a whopping 200 calories in a quarter cup. If this is correct (which I don't think it is), that is very fattening, even for granola. The soups are pretty good and the marinara sauce is a keeper. For my money, Cooking Light produces much better cookbooks."
4,"Great food, healthy too","I ordered this book site unseen after reading UltraMetabolism. This book is great for the average food lover, those with food intolerances and those who like to cook healthy. It has some staples such as salad dressings, to more inventive dishes that are still simple to prepare. Great all-around cookbook and I would recommend it to anyone."
4,"Canyon Ranch Cooks: More Than 200 Delicious, Innovative Recipes from America's Leading Health Resort",I can only find ingredients for some of the recipes but they sound good.
4,Great gift for cooks!,"""Canyon Ranch Cooks"" offers tempting, delicious and healthful recipes tht anyone can make. The photographs and world-class quality of the book will make it a treasured addition to the library of friends and family alike."
5,Superb healthy recipies,"Wow, if you want some really healthy and interesting meals, this is the book for you. The range of foods is awesome, the taste and presentation come out really good. It is so like being at the spa. Love this book!"
5,Smooth,Works Great in multiple brand guns!I have nothing more to ad but the make you type a certain amount of words.
4,Good Performer,"We use NT Server 4.0 now and have for about a year now. It has been a solid performer and we have very rarly had to shutdown. Usually when we do, it is because we upgraded something, added software or had hardware problems (IBM). There are a few features we would like to see such as better compatability with Win95 and a better messaging service as well as easier notes integration with Lotus Notes. But other than those things, We are pretty pleased."
3,Not very ... developer friendly,"I have been programming activex in NT for years. Each time I update the software, I have to reboot the server to release the object that already loaded in the memory. Even though I did a set object.close and set object = nothing, sometimes it didn't kill the process successfully. Other than that, I think NT is ok."
4,"Fun, fun, FUN... what you'd expect if you like Bruce Willis","Well, here we have re-re(re?)-issues of tracks from Bruce's '86 & 89 releases ""The Return of Bruno"" & ""If it Don't Kill You it Just Makes You Stronger"". He sings like he talks, you'd never mistake his voice for someone elses. Lots of fun, especially if you've seen the 'videos' & in concert specials. I recommend buying this album for the fun of it. Have I mentioned that Bruce has lots of fun with the songs, & that it makes the songs fun to listen to? Bruno's Bop, Jackpot, Comin' right up... he takes save the last dance for me seriously tho'... & it's just as enjoyable."
1,how come only the good reviews get emphasized?,"Almost all of bruce willis' ""albums' stink. He is no musician! HOWEVER SCAN THROUGH cdNOWS inventory...there is not one single bad review...why? CD now is about selling CDs..you think they would ever highlight bad reviews of any CD? Hell there must be some poor schmuck who gets off on Frank Yankovichs polka smorgasbord...and this review gets printed to boost the sale of poor Frank's album..Get with it people, reviews mean nothing!Especially in this mileu."
4,Loved the music - wish we had more,"I loved the music. Wish there was more.The story itself is apparently not very accurate which I think in retrospect is annoying. Also nothing really grabbed me in the story. Also not knowing much about music, I wish they had better explained what a copyist does.I thought the acting was good. The characters in their own way were interesting. I particularly liked Beethoven.The filming I thought was good."
5,understanding genius,"The title is confusing -- Beethoven's Copyist would have been better. Beethoven is trying to complete the 9th Symphony in time for the primere and he is desperate for a good copyist of the score is is continually revising even as it is in rehearsal.To Beethoven's distain, he is sent a young woman. As they learn to work with and appreciate each other, we see how true genius functions. Worth getting if only to see the sensuous teamwork between Beethoven and his copyist while conducting the final movement of the 9th (the chorale)."
2,superficial historic fiction with great music,"This movie has tolerable acting by Harris and Kruger, but why mispronounce Beethoven's name? Van instead of von? At least the German born Kruger could have gotten them to correct that fluke.If you took away the music this wouldn't be worth watching, and I for one would not recommend its purchase. Buy an album of the Concert Gebouw's recording instead."
5,"Beautiful music, superb acting","I enjoyed the human aspects of the characters as portrayed, the settings, the drama, the story line, the music and the eventual triumph of it all. No one knows for sure the reality of the events of his life, so artistic license had to be employed I am sure. I believe it could have been as depicted, but even if not, the actors made me think it so."
4,Fascinating character study,"Ed Harris did a wonderful job portraying the character of Beethoven. I found the story line to be accurate as much as we know about the man today. It made him very real to me, as a spiritual being - an artist creating with sound, and his love of the effect of sound. The movie was interesting and inspiring, all the way through.Though it was not thought provoking, the movie had a deeper spiritual aspect that cleared up misconceptions I had about Beethoven, allowing me to enjoy Beethoven's works with enriched understanding of the man himself."
3,"Silly, but sometimes moving","I'm a composer. This was going to seem a little silly, unless it got it just right. It didn't, quite.Some of the dialog--such as B. describing his intentions as he dictates a late quartet--is painfully bad. Also, the Diane Kruger character wasn't interesting enough to carry the movie. The scene of her assisting in the performance of B.'s 9th looked ridiculous, except:It was B.'s 9th. So it made me cry.This has an Eastern-European earthiness and also a genuine reverence for music. So it was clunky as heck in spots, even incompetent, but sometimes moving. Good for a laugh and a few tears if you are a musician."
2,A Travesty for the Gullible,"Great unappreciated artists of the world, drop your drawers! It works every time, judging from the cornucopia of gaga reviews given to this awful movie. (1) I found the distortion and speculation in this film insulting. (2) Mr. Harris's portrayal of Beethoven was embarrassing to say the least. (3) The musical examples performed on camera in the drama itself (as opposed to in the background soundtrack) often had never been played in that context historically. And one of the pieces heard in the drama only existed in manuscript during Beethoven's lifetime. One ought to honor great artists, not smother them in the mundane!"
2,Harris plays Beethoven; Beethoven loses,"Those of us with an aesthetic bent always hope a film about a great artist will add to our understanding of that ineffable something which explains the transcendence that can arise from among us. This movie ain't it. Ed Harris, so brilliant elsewhere, is hilariously miscast. The script is a one-day-pass to Beethoven World. The cinematography, particularly in its effort to add impact to the obscenely truncated Ninth Symphony sequence, only trivializes the music. Nuance? subtlety? Look for another source."
1,Overrated,"Write-ups described this product as outstanding, but I found the story--made up--was boring and far below the other Beethoven movie, Immortal Beloved. Ed Harris' performance did not equal his best or even his average acting. A waste of time and money. Do not buy this disappointment."
3,good film BUT only one soar spot...,"This film is worth watching. I won't bore anyone with the positive details.My ONLY soar spot is the casting of Diane Kruger as Anna Holz. This role was written to tap into the soul of the most complicated and distraught composer of our time. Yet her performance is not entirely convincing. It lacks passion. It even seems bland at times. I'm not familiar with any other of Krugers' work, but at best, she's a pretty girl who can read her lines. That's all it takes in Hollywood, right?As a lead role, I'd rather see Kruger in something made for the SCI-FI channel. Maybe SPECIES 4 or 5.....whatever?Sorry DK."
3,Very Good...but...,"I enjoyed the story and the actor's portrayal of Beethoven. Some awesome quotes as well, talking about God's involvement in music. But...Once again, I do not understand the need to include the name of Christ in a derogatory manner. Using His name out of anger...is very very hurtful....why cannot they make a movie that honors the name of Christ instead of cursing...?"
2,Better than nothing,"I saw this movie on a TV station that interrupted, sometimes mid-scene, cutting hard from movie to commercial. And the frequency and length of commercial units was extremely distracting. They also included factoids about Beethoven on a 3rd-grade level.The much vaunted Beethoven's Ninth segment was destroyed by the vicious insipid cuts of the music. Ouch and ouch.The story is of course total fiction, which is not in itself a criticism, but had tender moments, though it was often just dopey. Beethoven is presented in a way that was actionable. And his quotable quotes were nonsense.However if you love Beethoven and are interested, you can at least see how he dressed, where he might have walked, how lighting and transportation were handled and to a lesser extent, ablution. Those are why I watched. The actress is adorable. Ed Harris' Beethoven is, dunno, I did not buy it--not his best work but not awful either. The bit with the nephew was filler."
3,"High production values, but superficial?","I'm not as overwhelmed as the last reviewer. The movie is visually very pleasing, and of course the music is wonderful, but the characters and their situations are terribly cliche'd, and the script pretty clunky and wooden in places. Basically, this is just an old-time Hollywood biopic with a touch of social comment (the role of women) and discussion of the nature of Art thrown in. Diane Kruger is curiously lukewarm and not entirely convincing, but Ed Harris does a good job, and despite my reservations this is certainly a movie worth watching."
4,Most of the stars go to Harris,"He's one of those rare actors that can't be pigeonholed into a role or type. For a while there, Ed Harris simply was Beethoven and we were watching him slowly wind down his life til he went out in a blazing hymn.I wouldn't buy this film to watch over and over unless I was a very strong classical music fan, but ""Copying Beethoven"" was well worth watching at least once."
2,"Two stars for any movie about Beethoven, composer, not dog.","Why can't Hollywood exhibit any intelligence? Profit motive only?Well, perhaps one of these days someone there will realize that an accurate movie about what really happened in Beethoven's life would pack 'em in to the theatre faster. Beethoven's true life, not fabrications based upon marginal and basically unknown love fantasies about him are insults to the movie-going public and the nobility of his person. I've lost any remaining respect I had for Ed Harris with this movie. This movie does a great dishonor toward the spirit of a great human being.Think how exciting a movie would be which was accurate in it's depiction of his true talent and inconceivable suffering."
4,Copying ....,As a movie on the whole it is okay. The acting is great and the story is great. I don't think the facts are straight though. So if you just want to be entertained and are a fan of era movies then this one will bring satisfaction.
1,Copying Beethoven,"Unfortunately this movie just does not make it. Americanisms and American slang as the language of early 19th century Vienna are out-of-place. The acting is poor; Ed Harris is supposed to be deaf as Beethoven, yet he responds to questions and conversations as if he had perfectly normal hearing. The music, of course, is grand, but I can listen to Beethoven anytme. And Diane Kruger as a copyist who helps Beethoven conduct his 9th Symphony is not believable. We get 10 to 15 minutes of the 9th while watching these two interact; it has no credibility. Poor acting, poor story, poor performances."
4,Great screenplay.,"It's a film worth seeing. It likely didn't happen the way ""Copying Beethoven"" plays out, but I like original screenplays like this. My parents are well into their 80s and loved the movie, especially sinceEd Harris is from our birth state of New Jersey, which has nothing to do with the movie except a slight music connection: Ed's dad sang with Fred Waring's choir. The beginning, where the copyist is riding in a carriage, hearing a Beethoven fugue inside her head, mixed with all she is seeing outside, is very well pieced together. Cool."
4,"No, it's not ""Amadeus"" nor even close but...","...with a superb performance by Harris and two hours of gorgeous Kruger, how can you miss? The music is great too..."
1,Very disappointing,"Bad acting, horrible writing, and not enough music. It was a painful hour and a half - do not waste your time!"
5,Works exactly like it should.,"I was doing a subwoofer install in my 2007 Camry LE and hooked this up from my JVC Arsenal HU to my AQ 2200D and it does everything it should. I haven't had ANY static or engine noise at ALL coming through. You can pretty much never go wrong with Monster Cable wires, this wire is very durable and bends easily also for getting around those awkward places in your vehicle. The ends have a very snug fit and haven't had any problem with them coming off. I would highly recommend this to anyone doing an install in their vehicle for hooking you HU up to your amp. It carries a very clean signal and is built like a tank. Can't go wrong here."
4,Good everyday lens,"This has become my go to lens for everyday pictures in and around the house. It's quick, quiet, and is very versatile."
2,I'm sending it back....,"I bought this lens and was pretty excited about it, but I've been disappointed. Previous to this I bought the 50mm 1.8 for $70 and that lens completely puts this one to shame. I need a wider angle lens and went for this one, but all too often found myself quite disappointed with the results. Edges of subjects were all messy and just looked terrible, even at higher f stops. I shoot with a 20D.The USM is awesome though and will for sure be an option in whatever lens I choose to buy in place of this one. The focal range of 28-105 was also very nice, but to me the picture quality was not so good."
4,Love,if u get the chance skip getting the stock lens n get this one...not a zoom lens but it gets the job done..very good everyday use lens
4,Amazing addition for the price,"While this is obviously not an L lens, it still has great quality for the price. The auto-focus is second to none in most situations and the pictures are very crisp. It is extremely well constructed, and if your on a budget like me, is the best lens to upgrade from the basic 18-55mm lens. The ability to Manually focus while still on Auto-focus is great for those shots you can't get it to perfectly pick up on. All in all a great Canon product. For the money its definitely 5 stars, but in the grand scheme of things a 4 is more appropriate."
4,Outstanding value for the price!,"I just wish it was a bit faster, but for this price, I can't complain too much. For general photography, this is my go-to lens."
4,canon lens,"This lens should have come with the canon rebel xt.It is noticable improvement over the kit lens.Within a month i purchaced the 70-200F4,non i.s.L lens and love it.I needed a better quality all around lens and chose the 28-105 usm.Image and sharpness are good at f5.6 or better and overall results are very good outdoors.I have only taken 30 or so shots with it so far but plan on using it alot in the future.I purchaced the canon hood at the same time.My next investment will be a good flash,but for now i am set on lenses.For the price you cant beat this lens,i recommend it as and upgrade for rebel xt kit,or buy the body and lens seperate."

4,Better than Home Depot's,The quality of this punch far exceeded the quality of the punch I purchased and returned to Home Depot. I would recommend this product.
3,Could be better...,"Can't make a hole with the biggest punch. And that was the size that I needed for my immediate project. The leather that I am using is a bit on the thing size. And that's most likely why I can't make the punch.Good thing the next biggest size is not that much of a difference (at least for my project). It works with that one pretty well. I am satisfied with the product, just wish that it could have been better (sharper maybe?)."
1,Not worth the $,"I've had a couple of hole punches in my life, this one stinks, can't punch a hole in anything tougher than paper (1 sheet)."
1,Unsatisfactory,"This product failed in normal use, the second time I used it, while punching holes in a leather belt. I have discarded it to the trash.It became unserviceable by twisting out of shape while hand pressure was applied , with an arm disengaging from the rotating drum containging the punch elements."
5,Pretty good,"This is decent for the price. It is a little hard to work through thick leather, but my husband can do it."
4,Extremely Functional,This belt hole puncher works like a charm. The only complaint I have is that I'm unable to tell when the punch goes all the way through the belt. It does take quite a bit of strength to allow the punch to puncture all of the way through. But it's leather and that's what you'd expect.
4,Works,"I was kind of leary purchasing the rotary style punches. This is better than some of those cheap ones, a little better quality. I only use it for leather crafting and serves it purpose."
5,Came in handy for making belts smaller.,"Had a few belts that needed a few notches, so I picked up this heavy-duty bad boy. I like how it has different sized punches, which because I had a few belts with different-sized holes. Recommended."
4,Easy to use,"I bought this because I bought a belt that was way to big for me and I didn't want to return it. It will also come in handy when my husband wants to buy a new belt because it has gotten too small, hehe. I'm no Wonder Woman so I was worried I wouldn't have enough muscle to actually punch a hole in a leather belt, and luckily I was wrong. If I can use it so can you!! I like how it has different sizes for the belt holes. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
5,great tool for the price,"I'm so glad I found the review by the buyer that posted the pictures of how to protect the punch blades! I doubled over some denim & started punching holes in the watchband that I'm making for my son. makes for some awesome confetti by the way! I use the denim to wrap the punch wheel and hold the denim in place with a rubberband, while the tool is sitting in my toolbox. it's currently in use for going thru 2 layers of butter soft leather and 2 layers of innerface I took out of the back of a chair--heavy duty punching (but not as tough as a belt). well worth the price--glad I got this one."
1,"Tarzan trilogy with Crab, Bix and Scott","Absolutely terrible, this is the worst I have ever seen on DVD. They took three great movies and watered them down so bad that you cannot even see them. Not even the newest one, Tarzan and the Trappers came in watchable. This is very unusual for something that Amazon sells. It's not their fault but that of the idiots who put this mess on DVD!!! I have old Sword and Sandal movies from the 60's that come in 100% better than these. Please don't purchase this DVD!!! Sorry Amazon!"
3,Off-brand Ape Men,"The TARZAN, KING OF THE JUNGLE set is probably of lasting interest only to Tarzan completists, but it does nicely complement THE TARZAN COLLECTION. The latter comprises Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's six Johnny Weissmuller/Maureen O'Sullivan pairings -- the name-brand Ape-Man flicks of the 1930s; KING OF THE JUNGLE showcases the same decade's Brand X Tarzans, Buster Crabbe, Bruce Bennett, and Glenn Morris, as well as one of Weissmuller's successors, Gordon Scott."
3,black and white tarzan,"These videos are classic, old, kind of corny, he is always in a crisis.He whips through the jungle with no problem at all, while everyone else slugs along, I will probably watch them and then wait a while before watching them again... but I am not disappointed with the product, it was filmed in the 1930's after all. The bad guy is really a monster, killing everyone that crosses him or gets in his way, including innocent people.The film quality and sound is not great, just what you would expect from 1930."
1,Don't buy this DVD,N. Donvito's review was absolutely accurate. I only wish that I had read it in time. Poorest quality transfers that I have ever viewed. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD! (You have been warned).
1,Useless (for me at least),"I bought this book hoping for some instruction on the prophetic aspect of the workings of the Holy Spirit. I barely made it through the intro. To start with, the author writes like someone who really likes to hear their self speak. I consider myself to be fairly intelligent but the high brow babble went way past what I could follow. I don't really know what to say except that it wasn't what I expected at all. I'm assuming it is based out of Catholicism since there are several mentions of the eucharist (could just be my ignorance of other religions). I had no idea the Catholics had any experience in the prophetic. The author mentions things like certain instances of torture involving the eucharist in a manner assuming the reader is familiar with the instance and not giving any background. Overall the words I would use to describe this book are difficult, self-indulgent, creepy."
5,"riveting, it brings hope in somewhat of a lost world.",this book will open the eyes of anyone who touches it i personally like the way it distinguishes the everyday culture from a now present but subtle counter-culture.
2,Sherlock Holmes in Dallas paperback edition,"The text of the story is identical with ""Sherlock Holmes In Dallas."" Only the foreword and appendix differ. See reviews for ""Sherlock Holmes In Dallas."""
5,Especially Useful for Critiquing Your Writing,"The author walks the reader through 8 basic types of essays, and provides writing exercises for each of those types. Where this book is most helpful, however, is in the critiquing of the essays written by one of the author's students. Ms. Bender shows you her process of critique in the samples of the student's first draft and second draft.First, she singles out those ""velcro words"" (the nouns and phrases in the first draft essay that stick with her) -- and she encourages you to take your own note of your ""velcro words"". She then walks through her feelings as she reads the essay -- where she is intrigued, for example, or confused by the images the student uses. Finally, she shares this information with the student so that the student can choose to elaborate or minimize certain parts of the essay in a second draft, thus producing tighter writing and more polished images.I find Bender's process of critique quite useful and relatively painless."
4,For all beginner writers.,I have always wanted to learn how to write essays and this book is very good as a foundation type of book for essay writing. I recommend it highly.
4,Good item to purchase.,I wasn't sure what plasma was...but it looks just like neon. It lights up blue and looks really cool. The shipping was fast and the quality is very good.
1,Do not waste money on NT 4.0 anymore.,NT 4.0 is obsolete now. Get 2000 server for more security and features. It will save you money.
3,Packaging,The packaging of the product when I received it was awful. The nails had come out of its orginal package and was seperated in pieces in the box. Very disappointed on how it was shipped.
2,Wrong nails,"I ordered 3 different size Senco nails from Amazon for my finish nail gun, 1-1/2"", 1-3/4"" and 2-1/2"" all were advertized as electro galvanized. Of what I ordered only the 2-1/2"" arrived as ordered. The 1-1/2"" showed up bright, not galvanized. The box marked 1-3/4"" showed up with 1-1/2"" long bright (non-galvanized) nails inside. I will keep all the nails that were shipped even though they are less expensive bright and wrong size nails because I hate the hassle and I don't have the time to try and make it right. I've purchased many things from Amazon and this is the first time I've had a problem. I will not be buying nails from Amazon again. I will pay a little more at the local big box store and get what I pay for."
5,Nails work,I bought these nails for use in the DeWalt D51275K nailer. It works well so far. I just wished they made these nails in a galvanized version so I can use them in bathroom trimwork.
2,Wrong nails,"I ordered 3 different size Senco nails from Amazon for my finish nail gun, 1-1/2"", 1-3/4"" and 2-1/2"" all were advertized as electro galvanized.

3,Part fits XL's,"This kit has 5 1/4"" centers and the package states the part is for 91 to 08 XL'sThe Evo big twin has 6"" centers. My 3 star review only reflects that I could notuse this piece and have no opinion on how well it works."
5,Sick and Tired,If you read this book and you are able to understand his message then you can become your own Doctor and you never have to see a Doctor because you don't get sick.
1,Known Quackery,"This clown has been pushing mind-blowing idiodic dis-information for quite some time. Remember, he's not a medical doctor and none of his degrees are in medicine. read much more here:[...]"
1,Pseudo-science,"Someone gave me the Tony Robbins ""interview"" (does Tony EVER let someone else talk?) and this book. My suspicions went up when I heard Young validate his counsel by saying that his foods had better ""kirlian photography results"" and that foods had ""megahertz"" associated with them. This led to amusement when he talked about ""live"" and ""dead"" foods and then advocates his over-priced and MLM-sold freeze-dried powders. Then he was full-tilt into ""structured water"" and the conspiracy of the food industry. Eat more vegetables, OK OK Ma!"
1,it's a little like a sponsored rant,"Aimed at the American market, this book at times resembles a sponsored rant. Buyer beware, if you don't like your facts sugar coated and dumbed down, you will be frustrated by this book; useful details, (like how to actually proceed with the programme) are present but well concealed in acres of anecdotal rubbish. Ahh, and then there's chapter 4- the testimonials-God may bless Dr Young (according to his success cases), but God help us that have to read such emotive drivel. I would not recommend buying this book- choose another title if you want to know about the acid alkaline diet"
3,Against meat. If you are a Vegan you love it. otherwise...,"Two major issues with this book, lots of pictures of stuff with a caption only. No details to point out what is what, since I am not a scientist I would like more details on the pictures of cells and such. What is what.Also I am sure one can eat animal protein, drink milk, and eat eggs while maintaining a correct PH. Other books will reflect this. I certain that Young has a personal reason that is not necessarily scientific in this regard.The book is overall interesting and informative.You might also enjoy ""The Cure for all Disease"" By ClarkLori"
1,Bogus pseudo science not based on facts,"The science referred to in this book is bogus and is only a roose to get you to buy into their multi level marketing of Innerlight products. The authors of this book own Innerlight which is a multi level marketing company that sells dried vegetables and alkalizing vitamins.Tony Robbins changed his Living Health Program to include theories based on ""Doctor"" Youngs ""findings"". Prior to that, Robbins subscribed to the Fit For Life program by Harvey and Marilyn Diamond. While the basic dietary guidelines are the same, Young's program promotes his vitamin supplements and Diamonds book concentrates on food.All bibliography information in this book is from sources like Newsweek and outdated 19th century scientists. Youngs suggestion that cells morph into yeast is completely bogus and based on no scientific proof whatsoever.If you are into pill popping and drinking green sludge to alkalize your body, you will enjoy this book and Innerlight products."
5,Stop being sick and tired!,"Robert Young could be on a revolution in health and biology. His diet programme is for health, energy and weightloss and it works! It's recommended by Tony Robbins and James Redfield. After following the programme for six weeks I have more energy and have lost three inches off my waist - easily just by changing what I eat not cutting down on how much I eat. Read this book!"
5,We have fun everytime.....,We have fun everytime we read this book. My daughter received it as a Christmas gift last year. It's one of our favorites. The pictures are colorful and full of life. My daughter really enjoys the story. She likes to hunt for the ladybug too. Pick up this book for your child or for a gift for someone elses. You will not regret it.....
5,Great Basics,Sharon Newman has done a fantastic job of putting the basics in this book. I always refer to this book when I am doing the binding on my quilts - her method is the best and the mitered corners are beautiful. I also refer to it when trying to decide what size blocks I want for a certain size finished quilt. The charts are great! I highly recomend this book for all quilters. I buy copies for friends frequently.
3,Good movie if you can truly suspend disbelief,"A good movie that could have been much better if they stayed away from the military theme. Having spent much of my life in the military, I had a very difficult time ignoring all the glaring flaws. For entertainment value alone it is quite good. The acting and action scenes are well done, however, the plot is confusing and so far off base that it drags down a great cast and crew to the level of a B movie action flick. If you think this is a realistic, or even plausible, depiction of a military prison, then you are very wrong."
3,Just another American movie!,"This is the type of movie that you enjoy your time watching but after it's finished you realize it's not all that!Of course the actors did a good job, the scenes are fine but the plot is very hollow. If you really want to watch a prison movie I'd recommend ""Shawshank Redemption"". But I see this movie failed the same way ""Pearl Harbor"" did.In summary, the content is rich but the plot is empty!"
4,A Surprisingly Good Movie,"When a friend first told me about this movie, I thought it was Robert Redford trying to make a return to the screen. But after watching the movie, I can honestly say, it was one of the best Robert Redford movies I've seen in a long time. Robert Redford was phenominal in his role as a Army General who sentenced for ten years at the Castle, for disobeying a direct order from the President. James Gandolfini was also very good as the Castle's Commandant. I would highly recommend this movie to any one."
5,Great movie,This movie was sent quickly and in great shape. I am very satisfied with the product and would order form this distributor in the future.
3,"Good, not great. Solid","Fine performances across the board. Redford, Ruffalo, and Gandolfini all turn in solid performances. A good movie, enjoyable and something you will want to watch every once in a while."
4,Good Viewing,"Although often implausible, this is a rousing film of adventure and a fight against evil.A personality and power struggle between the imprisoned General Irwin (Redford) and the sadistic Army-prison commander, Col. Winter (Gandolfini), is bound to end in disaster. But even though I realized this early in the movie, I still sat on the edge of my seat because the element of suspense was highly maintained.Irwin and the other prisoners hatch a futile-seeming plot to unseat and disgrace Winter, plotting that the viewers never really see---it just happens. Irwin gives these prisoners -former Army men-a sense of purpose as they try to rebel against the brutal regime in the prison. The characters in this movie are well-defined as we see them work towards redemption and salvation. Although a long movie, the action moves it right along. The acting is excellent as well.Despite some holes in the plot and a lot of contrivance, this was a decent film."
2,Doesn't Earn What it Seeks,"I rented the DVD. I liked the idea of the movie. I didn't care if it was going to be predictable or cliched or a bit far-fetched. I was ready to feel good about heroism and leadership and good guys triumphing over oppression. I was disappointed. The filmmakers evidently thought they could deliver what I wanted by stringing together feel-good moments using contrived, cheezy plot details. What happened? Did they give the paragraph plot outline to an amateur to fill in? I did enjoy some of the acting, especially James Gandolfini as Colonel Winter, the warden. I did not find Redford compelling in his role as General Irwin. Maybe this was another shortcut - no need to develop the character, after all, its ROBERT REDFORD!"
2,good acting but still boring,Soldiers in prison so it can't be all that violent. Robert Redford is a great actor as usual but the story line was uninteresting to watch it unfold. I felt sorry for Robert a lot in this movie. I think this movie is a lot about honor. I found it uneventful.
2,American Propaganda,"This film is a poster for American cliche filmaking at its worst. Typical characters, poor story, unbelievable plot turns. What a waste of some talented actors. Do yourself a favour and see Redford in Brubaker, a much better film."
3,Took a half year to get here,"I'm not happy with the company because it arrived 4 months later than they promised. I love the movie, but I would have paid more to get it on time."
3,"Gung-ho potboiler, entertaining from start to finish","THE LAST CASTLE(USA/Canada - 2001)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSA battle of wills erupts between a martinet prison warden (James Gandolfini) and his latest inmate (Robert Redford), a former Army officer who leads an uprising against Gandolfini's brutal regime.A B-movie plot with A-class production values, toplined by one of the world's most recognizable actors, and played with grim conviction by a fine supporting cast. The escalating conflict between Redford and Gandolfini conforms to every expectation, and the final assault on the warden's stronghold is deliriously over-the-top. But the movie works like a dream, thanks to star wattage from Redford and gung-ho direction by Rod Lurie, working from David Scarpa's old-fashioned screenplay, co-written with Graham Yost. An unpretentious, entertaining potboiler, no more or less. Music by Jerry Goldsmith."
1,Staggeringly Bad,"This film is so outrageously awful it makes me ashamed to be American. What must people in other countries think when they see this RIDICULOUS, murderous behavior that masquerades as American patriotism? They must be scratching their heads in absolute confusion. An understandable argument may be, ""Lighten up, it's just a movie."" But I say film (fictional or non) is a very, very powerful medium, and filmmakers should be conscious of what they're putting into the heads of people worldwide. Besides the message, the dialogue and events in this picture are just downright silly. The prisoners, unbeknown by every guard at the prison (obviously), have constructed a large catapult that they've hidden somewhere in the prison yard. Was there a script available before they starting shooting this stuff? A very backward movie."
4,Incarcerated Power Struggle,"Lieutenant General Eugene Irwin (Robert Redford) is sentenced to ten years in a military prison that is controlled by Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini). General Irwin simply wants to serve his time in order to return to his family. It seems to be an easy task, however, Colonel Winter is seeing trouble in the hierarchy of the prison and feels the need to demonstrate his authority. This leads to a chain of events that results in the Last Castle depicting arrogance, leadership, and doing the right thing."
3,"Chess, anyone?","Unfortunately, I don't know a lot about chess. But ""the chief"" does. ""The chief"" is what many of the prisoners come to call the general (played by Redford), the newest prisoner to the Castle. One of the other prisoners, Yates, doesn't much care for chess and lets the chief know that. The warden has a bad habit of seeing only the worst in the men who must stay at his prison, and he believes that counting on the bad in the men, Yates in particular, will help him win this particular game of chess. But the chief has a way of focusing on the good in other men, pinpointing their strengths, strategically placing them on the chess board in a way that he hopes will ensure a win not just for himself, but for all the prisoners at the Castle. The chief finally calls the men to arms in order to battle for their castle, their flag, their own worth. This movie is action-packed and will keep you on the edge of your seat."
4,"Dont listen to the critics, its great!!!","This movie is simpley great.It is entertaining, and fun.The cast is amazing.It stars two great actors,Robert Redford, and James Gandolfini.If you want to see a good movie, with two great actors in it,go see The Last Castle"
2,Lousy Movie,"The quality of the video is very good, and the acting is good, but the story itself is dopey. The way the prisoners take over the prison at the end defies reality. Where did all the weapons come from? How could the takeover have been planned to such precision and in such a short time? The whole thing is ridiculous. Waste of time. I prefer stories that make sense."
1,Robots Made This Movie,"To quote the comic book guy from the Simpson - Worst Movie Ever.If you want to see robotic versions of James G. and Robert R., then please check out this movie b/c that's how lifeless and unimpassioned this movie and their acting is.And the script seems like it was simply spit out of a computer simulator, with no human thought or logic given to it at all.All in all, not a bad effort for a bunch of robots and computers, but they still have a ways to go...."
2,not enough nails for this price,"does'nt say how many nails are in the package, turns out -only 1200 , can buy a box of 5000 at menards for $8.00"
4,Great UPS Overall,"This is a great UPS overall, but it is pretty noisy. It has a constant velocity fans that runs at all times. TrippLite would be well served to have a variable rate fan that cycles RPMs based on heat dissapation requirements, which would in turn create less noise. I have this unit protecting my home server, and luckily I was able to stow it inside an enclosure to cut down on the noise.In a rack, in a computer room (which is where it would normally be placed) noise wouldn't be an issue, but I wanted the protection this offered for my home server."
2,This is no masterpiece.,"After trying various recipes from ""Gone With The Grits,"" I can say that I was not just dissapointed, but also annoyed. Beware! Many of the recipes call for certain amounts of time to cook the dish or certain temperatures to cook at. Well you just about have to be a master chef in order to get some of the recipes to turn out correctly. Many times the dishes were too watery, too thick, burnt, undercooked, and so on. As for the quality of the recipes that turn out right, they are usually on the average side, with the very few exceptions being quite tasty (but loaded with fat and cholesterol). For those that go zealous about grits, you will probably find it acceptable. For those who moderately enjoy grits and are looking for recipes that please the mouth, go elsewhere. Besides the few good recipes in ""Gone With The Grits,"" the only other reason to buy this book would be for the humorous cartoons throughout the book."
2,Violence personified,"A not too subtle lesson that violence never solves anything. I found the movie far too bloody for my taste. However, those who enjoyed ""Fight Club"" would probably like this movie, as well."
3,Martin is the best-but he only does alright with this film!!,"I don't care what no one says, but Martin Scorsese is the greatest American director ever (lots of people agree with me on that one)!! Having said that, I don't think ""Gangs of New York"" is one of his best films. Its quite messy and his decision to hire Leonardo DiCaprio and Camerion Diaz was a terrible mistake. Also the script is rather uneven. But as always, Martin shines with his direction. But that's the only bright spot in this film. One star for the costumes, one star for history, and one star for the great Martin."
4,O'dicaprio fresh off tha boat.,"never liked leo...still don't but he did a fine job in this movie. Lewis on the other hand Was the movie. bill cutting is one of the best characters to come along in a good while. can't get enough of this movie, although, they could have played down the love story."
3,"Historically interesting, but much too violent....","This DVD is interesting from a historical point of view, and the scenery and costumes were fabulous. As all non-native Americans came from immigrant families at one point in time, it was informative and even heart-wrenching to see what life was like for the immigrants in this movie. However, there is too much senseless violence-even beyond the point of recognizing that daily violence for survival was a way of life in many large cities at that time."
2,Obviously a Minority Report,"The rave reviews of THE GANGS OF NEW YORK make me feel as though I missed something. But in electing to wait until this noisy mess of a film came out on DVD I was able to watch it without the star-influenced clutter of a movie house screening. Martin Scorsese has made some fine films, but this overstuffed, empty attempt at producing an epic in the form of Grand Old Hollywood days is so full of errors, fake fighting, overblown and overstated scenic clutter, and just plain phoniness that it is hard to stay with it. The constant background music of Irish tunes is distracting, the acting is stagey and, with the exception of Danien Day-Lewis, is miscast. Perhaps someone thought that putting big names like DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz might help this treacly plot, but it only shows their relative lack of resources. This is an overlong, tired movie, recommended only for those in need of a somnolent."
1,Be Careful!!!,"This is a great movie, but I bought the edited for TV version and it was by no means edited at all! The first 1/3 of the video was fine, but full-frontal nudity and graphic intercourse scenes soon followed. Completely over the top for my 11th grade US History class to witness."
1,"Vile, vitriolic, putrid movie","This represents the worst of Scorscese (who totally bores me nowadays by the way), recycling the same violent thematic lines present in nearly all his work. This movie is gratuitous and no means educational. Ruined my apprecation of D.D. Lewis as well. Vulgar."
1,You can do better,"Usually a film has to have the word ""Malibu"" in the title to be this dumb. It wouldn't suck except for how much money and talent was squandered producing something that is neither history or entertainment. Everybody involved has done something great, go watch that instead."
1,What a terrible movie!,After sitting through 2 disc's waiting for something good to happen...I'm still waiting.
1,Cynical History,"Historical accuracy is not the strong suit of this movie. I understand the need for dramatic license to drive a compelling story but what aggravated me about this film is that it dishonors the memory of the overwhelming majority of 19th century New Yorkers, both natives and immigrants, who worked their behinds off in legitimate trades and professions. In reality this city was built by extremely hard working people that lived decent lives grounded in faith. They don't exist in this film. Of course plenty of crime & corruption existed but the vast majority of people struggled honestly to improve their lot. Faith was a crucial component of the difficult lives of most and yet we get the obligatory Hollywood gratuitous slander. Throw the Bible in the river. Tell the the pastor when he mentions the church service to ""go to hell""."
1,"ah man, yawn!!","Everyone should save themselves the hard ache and not see this snooze fest. I don't understand the majority reviews. It seems they're in denial. I have to admit, the title and era sound awesome. But don't let that get u fooled. Undoubtedly, it's not an action film, with explosions, and stuff like that. I don't even know what the plot was. I wish I had my 3 hours of my life back."
5,Leo is the best!,"Leonardo DiCaprio is the best actor in the world. After this movie I believe he will win many Academy Awards, if not then they dont know what they are doing. This movie seems worthwhle and I agree with Shadi. I believe this is his year. He will rule the box office this fall. Catch me if you can also will be a huge hit. Leonardo is really something. He not only is a good actor but really cares about the environment and that is a really good thing."
2,Gangs Of New York,"""Gangs Of New York"" was a movie that started out good but then got confusing and very much idiotic. It started showing blood and guts and this movie totally got pointless. I do NOT recommend you go and see the movie ""Gangs Of New York"". Its dull! And it has been nominated for eight Academy Awards!? Ha! Critics must be dumb!"
1,Scorsese falls on his face,"Scorsese is great when he sticks to historical realism, but this absurd fantasy looks like a cross between the Keystone Cops and Monty Python, with lots of Sam Peckinpah blood thrown in. It's not funny, it's not dramatic, it's not believable, it's not clever, it's not exciting, but it is totally ludicrous. However, it takes itself so seriously that you can't even laugh at it.Leonardo DiCrappio gives another crappy performance. He really is a one-note actor, and his attempt at an Irish accent is pathetic.I'm a fan of Scorsese, but I turned off this turd after 30 minutes.Those people who think this is a great film can keep the Jim Jones Kool-Ade to themselves; I'm not drinking it."
3,Good Movie,"I like the movie. Good acting, good story, and I love Scorsese.My main gripe is for some reason I have to switch the DVD in the middle of the film to see the 2nd half. Pretty inefficient."
3,A bit Long,"The story was interesting but it was tough staying interested. Danile Day Lewis kept changing accents throughout the movie, not sure how this happened so quickly."
2,Historically unacurrate tripe from Hollywood,Amazon.com reviewers never cease to amaze me. the worst of the trio is easily Gangs of New York. The plot was inventive but pulled off horribly. Why are Black folk running around NY helping out Irish blokes? Confusing to say the least....I challenge anyone to remember the ending (and care) about what happened to the central characters. I only gave it to stars cuz even tho she's kinda pale Cameron Diaz looks fun....Holla
2,Kindofsucked,"How many Acadamy Award Nominations? Wow, what a let down. Leonardo DiCaprio really can't act very well and he proved that yet again in Gangs of New York. The story is pretty good and I liked the acting of Danial Day-Lewis and even the cinamatography(sp?), but all that could'nt counter DiCaprio's poor preformance. Just how many crying scenes does he have in this movie? 8? 10? His character is a real wimp and so you just can't take him seriously as an avenging angel. Buy Goodfella's or Caligula but steer clear of this waste of money."
1,"Cynical, Grotesque, Unrealistic Portrayal of the Times","I didn't for a moment believe that I was in the time and place upon which the movie was based. Leonardo DiCaprio has had some good roles, but he's simply not believable in this one. There are no likable characters. Over-the-top, excessive, and perverse violence ruined any semblance of a plot. Scorsese should be ashamed of himself. He once was a good director."
2,"Day-Lewis Rocks, but the movie takes a beating!","Okay I've been impressed with Day-Lewis' performances before and this one was deffinantly not an exception however. The movie was so flawed it made me sick. How bad can one person screw up our nations history. Um, well, according to this movie. REALLY BADLY! Half the main characters were not that way in history, and Day-Lewis' character was a composite of 3 people over a 50 year span of history.Not to mention for all you conservative and well mannered people the idea of ""violence is okay because our country was founded on it"" may really rest uneasy for you. I found this movie to be so sick and twisted that when it was over I could have gone and watched Se7en, and felt like a normal human being."
3,"Excellent story, but drawn out, & some poor acting.","The story itself is quality - inspired by Herbert Asbury's non-fiction book: The Gangs of New York. Acting by DiCaprio and Diaz was rather POOR, but Daniel Day Lewis - his performance was excellent. He was very convincing in his role - he carried the movie otherwise I would not have continued to watch it. At 166 minutes I found it rather long - thank goodness I had a fast forward option."
5,"loved it years ago, still do :)",nothing else to say - great flick. Bill versus the dead rabbits - what could be better than that for an eve?
5,Love the drum beat before they go for a fight!,Brilliant! Love it! One of Leonardo's best acting. Got thing miramax got interested in the story when he wanted to act in it!
3,"Beutiful acting and camera work, but muddled script","I can't quite tell where this went wrong. About 2 hours through the film, the character's relationships all change, jarringly. While there is some warning of this, it seems like whole scenes are missing. Then, once you're reoriented, they do it again near the end of the film, with the NY draft riots hijacking the plot out of nowhere.A best guess would be that a good 30 minutes of continuity got slashed out by the studio (for running time), making the result jumpy and muddled. If so, I'd wait for the ""Director's Cut."""
2,"Subtle, it ain't!","Any time you notice someone acting, it's not necessarily a good thing! As I sat back watching Daniel Day-Lewis in Gangs of New York, I kept thinking to myself, ""Wow, look at Daniel Day-Lewis do this,"" and ""look at Daniel Day-Lewis do that,"" and ""gosh, Daniel Day-Lewis has a lot of talent!"" It suddenly dawned on me that I wasn't taking the chararacter of Bill the Butcher as seriously as I was DDL's skill as a performer. This to me is not perfect acting. If it had been, I wouldn't have noticed the ""actor"" at all. Don't get me wrong, DDL is still the most entertaining aspect of the film, but that's more a testiment to the film's failure rather than DDL's brilliance. I have loved Day-Lewis' past screen performances, but this one is best suited on stage where subtlety is not really a requirement. I never thought I'd live to witness a subtle, introspective Jack Nicholson (in About Schmidt) and a flamboyant, scenery-chewing Daniel Day-Lewis in the same year!"
1,Dittos: Nihilism + Revisionism + Goth,"I totally agree with the previous reviewer (science fiction). I walked out of the theater feeling like I wasted my money and time. And worse yet it left me depressed. By its gross distortion of reality and history, this deconstructionist movie embodies director's worship of evil and hatred for true heros.When I got home we did some research into the time period and found that a lot of the history was inaccurate. For example: The Irish poor hated the Negroes and feared that emancipation of the southern slaves would cause the blacks to take Irish jobs. This was the main motive for the Irish poor opposing the Union cause and the draft. One of the main buildings attacked by the Irish during the Draft Riots was an African American church and orphanage. Furthermore, the main character, Vallon, played by diCaprio, never existed. Nor did diCaprio's acting talent."
1,Preposterous and boring,No plot; overdone in all respects; poorly cast; ahistorical; rediculous survivals; but most of all utterly pointless. A waste of a precious evening.
5,another A+ video library addition,"Scorsese gives a view of early N.Y. that is pretty amazing....you wonder if its fact or fiction, but really entertaining none the less"
4,"Good history, good story, needless blood","I loved the interpretation of New York in the middle of the 19th century with its competing fire gangs, police thugs, corrupt city officials and local neighborhood gangsters. Although set in the 19th century it represents and describes a lot about New York City and other major cities today. There are gang wars over turf and drugs, corrupt city officials and police officers who shoot unarmed men 41 times in the back or use toilet plungers for interrogation and intimidation. Gangs of NY portrays a down side of city life that the regular medial looks the other way at and fawns all over corrupt city officials and their blue uniformed gangs. That part is worth seeing. I was disappointed in the level of blood that was depicted, and the deviations from history. There were draft riots in NYC, but the navy didn't shell the city as depicted. The meat cleaver scene was around the bend."
1,Not Historically accurate.,"While the story is good, the content represents decades of New York history spanning a longer period then noted on the screen. Some events did not occur at the same time or during the same era as presented."
4,A Beautifully shot movie.,"Gangs of New York is wonderfully acted, sometimes even brilliant. The set design is unbelievable. The story is interesting. But, I think the movies should probably been left at its' original run time, around 4 hours. This is an epic story and deserves ample time to show the depth of the characters and story. I understand that the average movie-goer will not pay to see more than 2 hours or so of a film. But, Gone With the Wind was long! I feel like the movie was CUT. You can almost tell that the story is moving along and then certain sub-plots seem to just conclude suddenly. It is a good movie worth seeing."
4,Almost 5 Stars,"Great movie, as expected from such a great director. It does however fall short of the fifth star because of the lack of historical authenticity. The Five Points neighborhood was not as violent as the film portrays, and quite honestly Scorsese is just providing us with an alternate history that's been created by his mafia centric filter. Other than that the movie is awsome and Daniel Day Lewis is superb."
3,Its good,Wish i would of got the blue ray comes in two discs thats what killed it awsome movie though fast delivary get the blue ray version great movie classic aswell !
4,Must Buy in Blu-Ray,"I'm still not quite sure why, but this has been my favorite movie for years now. My 10th grade teacher, Mr. Reyes, once suggested I watch it and when I did. I loved it. There's not much I can say expect, see for yourself the magic of history. But you must buy it in Blu-Ray. The quality and definition is magnificent! It's a wonderful movie, as well. Some great acting. Awesome for history buffs like myself."
3,Beautiful picutre + Brutal fighting + Good acting = Worth watching.,It's a beautiful picutre. It contains brutal fighting. The acting of main actors are good. It's worth watching.
3,Here's the deal,"This movie was far too long. The graphic violence was just way over the top. Leo DiCaprio was not the guy for the role.But Daniel Day Lewis's performance was something special. It was perhaps the greatest performance I have ever seen. I cannot fathom how bad this movie would have been without Lewis.If you are studying acting, watch this film. Lewis will surely inspire you. I don't study acting but the Lewis performance made me want to.I rate this movie a 3 star. Every star is solely because of Lewis."
1,Almost complete junk,"Daniel Day Lewis should run away with this film, but even he is not fast enough. He remains an absolute master of his craft, and almost surmounts the dreadful script and supporting cast. I MUST make an exception for Leonardo Di Caprio, who has greatly improved as an actor since the appalling Titanic. The settings truly evoke old New York in the Civil War era, but that's where it ends. WHY did they waste Liam Neeson on a role that's over before the credits begin? As for Diaz...one can only ask Why?"
3,Interesting But by No Means Scorsese's Best,"This is an interesting tale of 1860's (and earlier) New York where life was often as the historians put it ""nasty, brutish, and short"". I am curious how historically accurate the movie is, but if it is accurate it explains a lot about how New Yorkers are today (at least how they are perceived by those who are not New Yorkers). The opening battle scene is quite memorable as is Daniel Day-Lewis's character -- The Butcher. Leonardo DiCaprio & Cameron Diaz are less noteable, however."
5,Great Movie,"This movie is really good and some other reviewers don't give it enough credit. In this movie they showed how the ""Natives"" had so much hatred towards the irish.They showed how Amsterdam'sdad was killed by Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting. It should how violent the fights would get and there was alot of it.This movie is an excellent historical fiction movie."
2,Really hard to watch!,"I didn't go see the movie when it was at the theaters. My ancestors came from Donegal and County Tyrone, Ireland. There were so many wonderful contributions the Irish made when they came to America. They did backbreaking work for low pay and had to prove that they weren't all lazy, wild, drunks. Just when we think we may lose this kind of stereotype Mr. Scorsese makes this movie making the Irish look like crazy, fighting, murdering, cannabalistic, barbarians. I can imagine that Italian-Americans felt the same way while watching ""Goodfellas"", Mr. Scorsese! Don't do any of us any favors!"
4,Great movie in many aspects,"This movie is great. As a woman, there was a bit too much gore for my liking but if it didn't have all the gore, I'd rate this a perfect 5 of 5. Leo DiCaprio and Daniel Day Lewis are astonishingly wonderful actors portraying believeable characters. Leo's accent drops a few times (not sure why they didn't catch it and correct his errors) but for the most part the accent was good. The storyline is great, although the movie is long it goes by fast since it is so exciting. I'd definetly recommend this movie."
2,Thoroughly disappointed,"The story and setting had enormous potential but the casting left a lot to be desired. DeCaprio looks too much like a boy to play the role of a tough guy raised in a 19th century reformatory; poor dental hygiene aside, Oliver Twist maybe, Amsterdam Vallon never. Not enough Liam Neeson in the movie and Daniel Day-Lewis' performance as Bill Cutting was a little over the top. His character seemed better suited to the role of villain in a Batman movie."
1,Disturbing lack of historical accuracy,"This film omits a crucuial portion of the history of the 1863 draft riots. The riots largely targeted African Americans and included both the destruction of their property and the lynching and killing of African Americans. A number of children were killed when a building where Afircan Americans lived was torched. In an attempt to make the characters look sympathetic, the film ignores disgusting actions taken against a powerless minority.As an aside, this is not being PC. All histories of the draft riots include these accounts, including those of conservative historians."
1,Great acting in awful movie!,"This movie was an utter disappointment. It's bloody content with seemingly no sense made me wonder how people can complain about violent video games. The acting in this movie was stellar and every actor deserves an Academy Award. But the actual story and plot were awful and flimsy as paper. Any moral message the movie might have conveyed was destroyed by a stupid and unsatisfying ending. I don't know who this movie was written for, older people will find the violence appalling and younger views will be shocked and horrified by it. Being 27, I found the movie a waste of time. The dramatic performances were dim lights in this awful historical mess. The fact that SO MANY critics loved this movie makes me wonder about their sanity. It was an absolute waste."
2,turkey of new york,"Saw this film on TV. Didn't care much for it.Acting average. Costuming and scenery superb. Fight scenes splend especially the final one with Union Soldiers marching in to put down the draft riots.Otherwise, this film was nothing but thugs wielding knives and naked whores. None of the characters were likable or even sympathetic. The only one close to likableness was Cutting.The last scene of the movie pretty much matches my view of it in its entirety."
2,Not what I expected from Scorsese,"I've been a great fan of Scorsese's films, and I appreciate how deep he go into his films to portray a certain story in the past. However, ""Gangs of New York"" is not about NYC's past, or history, is about a family feud between two misfits who fight for the same reasons that every current war derives, including Mr. Bush's. Well, I think for this period of time is a political correct movie, but for someone who gave us ""Taxi Driver"", ""Mean Streets"", ""Last Temptation of Christ"", ""Goodfellas"", ""The end of Innocence"", among others, is definitly a step back, just like or current world."
1,Poor,"I saw Santa Trap with Robert Hays on tv, and then the older movie Airspeed with Elisha Cuthbert; then at a theater a worthless movie: Gangs of New York. It had enough interesting material for a 15-30 minute slide show on history Chanel. Why are these people supposed to be interseting? Do I feel empathy and compassion for them? Hardly. Day-Lewis may have been historically accurate vocally and in costume but he seemed to have escaped from Popeye starring Robin williams. Cameron D. was not attractive here."
5,Leo's Oscar,"I think that this movie will make history.Martin Scorsese never has won an Oscar and the Academy also must give an Oscar nomination for Leonardo DiCaprio.He wasn't nominated for his role in the winner 'Titanic',the film that made of Leo a great star and he deserved this nomination.The Academy must know that DiCaprio is the best actor of his generation and he's able to change for each performance.In fact,in this film he's fat and different of all his films.I think this movie that is about the gangs in the 1900's New York will be a success in the box office because seems interesting for all the audiences.Also will be the Oscar for a classic movie director as Martin Scorsese and,of course,one of the best movies of the next year.Good luck,Leo!You are the best!."
1,An Egregious Scorcece Film,"After having seen the phenomenal GoodFellas, I would have thought that Gangs was going to be a great Scorcece film. I WAS WRONG! The movie was boring from beginning to end. I fell asleep many times and so I just started to freak on my girlfriend.JK. Leo DiCaprio is a horrible actor. He should not make anymore movies in his career. Daniel Day-Lewis appears to look like a toothpick on-screen and his performance in this film was worse than DiCaprio's. The only highlight of this film was Cameron Diaz. She is an extremely sexy actress and brought some much needed life to this film."
1,WORST FILM EVER!!,"OMG I ordered this movie on pay per view at night and it was almost as bad as the 13th Warrior... I just kept watching and watching waiting for the ""plot"" to come out and it never did... TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE. Please for the sake of your self-dignity don't order this TERRIBLY overrated movie... aesthetic ... yeah right!"
1,Gangs of Sound Stage 6,"I agree with those reviewers who've seen through this movie. Under the period costumes and the periodic bursts of graphic violence, ""Gangs of New York"" is a set-bound bore. Bad dialogue, worse accents, and a cliched, spaghetti-Western plot. But, Gogol, if you're going to diss ""Once Upon a TIme in America,"" as innovative a gangster movie as ""The Godfather,"" at least blame the guy who did make it -- Sergio Leone -- not a guy who didn't -- Scorsese."
2,Gangs of nothing.,"Gangs of New York by Martin Scorsese could easily be his worst epic ever! I could never get into this bloody, violent film. Cameron Diaz looks so out of place in this film and that horrible accent she tries to pull off, jeez she belongs in a romantic comedy! There's no doubt Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis are gifts to the acting world but even these talented guys can't save this slow, boring train wreck. If you want a great Scorsese film then see Raging Bull."
3,Bill the Butcher - Patriot of the Future?,"I think Daniel Day Lewis made this whole picture. Goldenboy Leonardo and Shameron Diaz bogged it down.I love the whole idea of the movie. I read a book by Luc Sante entitled, These Were The Good Old Days, which chronicled the maggots which infested New York's rotten apple in the early 1900s.It would be interesting if Scorsese showed the life of a typical family living under such horrible conditions.I love Butcher Bill's centennial eyeball. The pseudo-patriots of today would give him a wink."
3,Disappointing,"I am a huge Scorcese fan and I was looking forward to this film for a long time. I saw it on openning day and I was very disappointed. The directing, soundtrack, cinematography, and Daniel Day Lewis' performance were spectacular and it is worth watching for those qualities but overall the film was mediocre.What I didn't like...1. The story builds up with the premise that Amsterdam (Leonard DiCaprio) will avenge his father's death but turns into a semi-documentary. If I wanted know about the history of New York I'll watch the History channel. When I go to see a Scorcese film I want to see mob violence.2. Miramax's influence shines through. There is only one short trademark bloody Scorcese scene and even that may be edited out of the home version. Leonardo DiCaprio and Cammeron Diaz? Directors just don't have the control over production that they once did."
2,Very overrated,"This movie is needlessly bloody, poorly scripted and not particularly well-acted. Leonardo DiCaprio was stiff and Daniel Day Lewis hammed it up (and looked ridiculous with his clown costume and sillly moustache). Character development was virtually nonexistent. Don't waste your $ on this one; critics are being kind to it based on Scorsese's past work."
1,bootleg video,"I was sent a bootleg copy of this DVD. If I would have known that it was a bootleg I would not have ordered it. Very disappointed, poor quality."
2,"As a period piece 3 stars, entertainment zero","Although the production values are excellent (the set decorations, costumes, and period music) and the story historically accurate(immigrants clawing for a place in society, the 1863 Draft Riots, the north's own prejudice to non-whites), ""Gangs of New York"" is an utter failure at entertainment. Scorcese seems to think non-stop violence is the best way to hold an audience's attention span for 167 minutes. Packed with gore, torture, and scenes of battle, this film is only for those with a strong stomach. I went eagerly to this movie as an armchair historian and Civil War buff but had to force myself to watch it and came away utterly repulsed. I can't even recommend it for historical value. Two stars only."
2,An okay movie...,"I watched this the other night, and I was impressed, partly. It wasn't an astounding movie, one that I believed deserved any oscars, but it was good. One thing I couldn't get over was how fake-looking the opening fight scene was. And if something looks fake in the beginning, it's hard to get a feel for it. The acting was OK. Daniel Day-Lewis was ok, but Leo and Cameron were much better. You could actually feel their roles---a little. All around, it's good to watch for historical value, and I now know why Roman Polanski won the oscar."
2,Very dissapointed...,"I think that this film was lacking....a lot. There was little depth to the characters even after the first 90 minutes. Who are these people? The quick flash of introductions of gangs left no time for absorption. The romantic aspect with the female was boring to say the least and I didn't see any reason for that character to be in the film. It just dragged the film out about an extra half hour..maybe longer. I wish Speilberg had directed this film or Kevin Costner even (with a better script). Like Shindlers List or Dances With Wolves, I think it would have given me a more dead-on feel of the times. Maybe I could have cared about the characters instead of just watching them run around punching and cutting each other. Then there was the awkward flash to the rich folks...where they talked about what was going on - as if they were narraters. Sorry, it was just too hollywood and I learned next to nothing."
4,^^,"It is the first time I have gone to the Martin Scorsese's movie so it is so difficult for me to appraise the director's direction ability. But I saw the movie and I am impressed huge scale and Daniel Day-Lewis's acting. Especially I think that the minor character's ating is very impressed. I think their acting is better than major characters, Leonardo Dicaprio or Cameron Diaz.Also I realize that Daniel Day-Lewis is very nice and excellent man during seeing the movie. When I had seen the movie, In the name of the father, I thought Daniel Day-Lewis is a common actor but I saw this movie and I feel his acting to overpower the audience. I think he is the best act in this year. I expect him to get a prize in many awarding ceremony.I want you to see this movie as soon as possible. I'm really impressed this movie"

1,Looking for a plot? This is not the one for you!,"If you want to see a film which shows what New York City was like in the 1860's, the background scenery is for you. History buffs might like it for that reason. But the plot--if it can be called that--very quickly descends into one long, bloody, gory beating. Granted, mindless violence is quite popular these days, but I think filming a boxing match would have provided more of a storyline than this epic actually managed to churn out. The only parts I found remotely noteworthy was the portrayal treatment of the Irish immigrants in the turbulance of the Civil War era.So, in brief, the only way I could see this picture even being considered for ""Best Picture of the Year"" would be if the only other contenders were ""Ishtar,"" ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" or anything else by Ed Wood."
1,"Think of Diaz, Think of Diaz, Think of Diaz...","Leonardo DiCaprio was prettier than Cameron Diaz. As a heterosexual, I find this fact deeply disturbing."
3,Was alright I guess,"This was my tradeoff movie. I got my husband to watch Titanic with me, so he wanted me to watch Gangs of New York. Just didn't really pique my interest. My husband kept having to stop it and explain things to me."
4,A very good film....,"but then again, how can you go wring with Daniel Day Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio? It's been out a long time and with all the lousy films out there it would be a crime to pass it over."
5,Scorsece's Best,"Okay, first let me say that this was by far Scorsece's best work. All the reviews I've read so far are extremely negative, citing the graphic violence in the film as a reason not to like it. Can I please just say that it's a movie about gangs in the 1800s, one of the most violent periods in America's history? Did all those reviewers expect roses and pleasantries? Yes, it was violent, exceedingly so in some parts, but that's how life was in NY at the time and it suited the tone of the film perfectly. As well, Leonardo DiCaprio was outstanding in the film (except for the sporadic Irish accent). He hasn't been this good since What's Eating Gilbert Grape.Go see this movie. It was breathtaking and shocking and utterly spectacular."
1,Dumb Flick,"I have always felt that Martin Scorsese was a very overated director, but this film was so bad it was hilarious. The acting was amateurish and the storyline so ridiculous and unbelievable that I felt I was watching a spoof. It played like an old fashioned melodrama. No wonder Harvey Weinstien flipped when he saw this thing. You have to give it to Miramax and their marketing acumen; that they managed to get six academy award nominations for this junk is impressive."
1,It's not all it's hyped up to be!!!,"I apologize for not agreeing with the masses here, but this movies was one of the biggest let downs for me this year.The visuals were stunning, hence the 1 star. Aside from that, the movie was long....OK, really long, and instead of that time being used to draw you in and personalize you to the movie, it just kind of dragged on. I felt that ending was rushed and diluted (I don't want to throw out any spoilers hence my somewhat vague decriptions). Maybe it was that the story (or the way it was told) seemed shallow, transparent, and moodless, though the sets did help in the mood department slightly.I think Scorsese had a pontential winner here, but he didnt pull it off, at least for me."
2,"Lots of flash, lots of action, and ... ?","I know the point of this movie was to 'educate' the public about early US history. But to justify millions of dollars of effort, the millions have to not just recreate a time, but also express something really touching within it. Actually, the latter is much more important.Scorsese didn't find anything touching. And I really think he was looking in the wrong place -- a very 'hollywood' place -- finding or forging big characters and contriving a big story.I have a hope, that long after we're all dead, the majority of the population will see the first 100 years of movie-making as very clumsy and misguided."
5,One of the Top 100 of all time,"DVD (and movies for adults) doesn't get much better than this! Director and actors at the top of their game and an interesting tale too. Great costumes, music, etc., AND DVD extras too. What more could one ask for?"
3,Dissapointed.,"A MOVIE WITH CHARISMA AND PASSION will normally help a movie. While those characteristics are no vice, they did not help this movie. The Butcher is an incredible actor, and very convincing, but neither Leonardo nor Cameron Diez were. The plot also was quite predictable and shallow: the first scene is a good indicator that revenge will be the central component of the movie. I have nothing against revenge, but if a movie goer could expect it, then it probably isn't exciting, eventful, or filled with much meaning.I think most people will be dissapointed with the movie considering the amount of hype that surrounded it."
4,Daniel Day Lewis for best actor,"Daniel Day Lewis shines amidst a wrenching, brutal film that focuses far too much on violence. Violence in itself is really not that exciting; seeing someone beaten to death with a cudgel is not my idea of a good time, especially after the third or fourth time in the same movie. I had unpleasant nightmares about it afterwards. Instead, they should have treated Di Caprio as Reeves was treated in ""The Matrix"", and let Daniel Day Lewis rule the film. He is to Gangs of New York as Johnny Depp is to Pirates of the Carribean; so far into character as to be indistinguishable from the role he plays. Not many actors can be so convincing, but Day-Lewis pulls it off with effortless charm. He is one of the great actors of the day. The rest of the film would be pointless without him, and it treads on the edge of inconsequential faux-historical fiction far too many times. Scorcese is a master, but you wouldn't know it from this film. Watch this for Daniel Day-Lewis."
3,DVD features & design,"This is a short review, simply to say that the DVD is terrible! *Why is it over two discs, when it could easily be put on a single disc? Because the designers for the DVD printing spread the special features across the two discs. In actuality, they should have had a separate disc altogether for special features...**Also, the way that the film was split is very awkward - disc two actually begins with a sex scene involving 3 girls and Bill the Butcher. I would think it more appropriate to cut to the scene which immediately proceeds it. That way, a better opening would occur (if it has to be on 2 discs that is). ..***Finally, the features are terribly boring, and very repetitive. It seems all special features are going this way nowadays. Whatever happened to the fascinating commentaries which were SCENE SPECIFIC, not just a collection of random comments. For eg. Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers commentary. Anyway - judge for youself."
3,"Scorese fans will be satisfied, if not blown away.","This film is bloated by at least a half an hour. Leonardo DiCaprio is woefully miscast. Cameron Diaz's character is not only extraneously adrift in this male-orientated film, but also jarringly contemporary. The film's ploting is eye-rollingly obvious; Henry Thomas' character's true motivations are laughably blatant from his introduction onwards, and the 'fever-pitch' resolution and its denoument are soporifically dissapointing, containing an alarmingly high 'Oh, get on with it!' quotient. The film does redeem itself somewhat by its sufficiently grandiose pretensions, although striped pants and bowler hats and a parade of silly period get-ups have never looked particularly menacing. The political allusions are murky as well, drawing rather tenuous parallels with contemporary New York.Proceed, but watch furtively."
2,Not the best work for scorsese,"I was disappointed and confused with the plot. No direction, or real story line. Just to gangs who want to rule New York. Wopty Do."
2,Not a good movie,The only thing entertaining was the costumes of the Irish. Which were those plaid colors and big top hats.Decaprio Father was a terrible role model. You have to pity any person raising up his child on gang fights. I can't believe it was that hard to survive getting off the boat. New York was probably the worst place to settle???? And all those brothels in NY.The big surprise is finding out Daniel Day Lewis is the main star... a blood thirsty crook!
2,Fiction Yes History NO,"This movie is the usual overblown attempt to try and rewrite history by using MEGO tactics not fact.First of all the so called ""Draft Riots"" were RACE riots led by the Irish against the Blacks whom they despised. Of the 500 people killed in those riots 100 were Black and most of the rest were business people and Protestant missionaries.Furthermore the ""hands that built America"" is a joke.This nations economic, political base were established long before these folks came here fleeing the oppressions of Europe and wanting to take ADVANTAGE of our oppertunities. Period.As fiction this is passable as HISTORY it is a laughing stock except to Socialists.Real Hard core American history? HA!!"
2,Gangs of New York,"As someone else put it, this film has no soul. It would appear from the detail in the sets and costumes that a lot of money was spent. But the film was too long and the plot roamed around aimlessly. I came away not really caring about any of the characters and then at the end of the film as it finally lurched to the ""final"" confrontation between Bill and Amsterdam. Bill is essentially killed by shrapnel from cannon fired from the harbor. Except for the great sets and ""atmosphere"", the movie was a waste of time."
3,Great Cast - No meaning,"I found little meaning in this movie. I enjoyed the idea and the historical setting, yet it seemed a little surreal.It was much like 'Once Upon a Time in America.' If you like that type of movie, you would like this.The senseless gore of the film was what irked me the most. DiCaprio is not too believable, yet Lewis rocks as a the archetypical villain. He is utterly believable.It is a story of revenge. DiCaprio's character at least did not give up his quest to avenge the death of his father."
3,Where is this movie going?,"A strong and powerful look at the birthing of a city. Then it goes to - I don't know. A long movie, which usually doesn't distract me, that seems to rush to an ending that is tacked on. The detail of the period and its activities as well as social mores is incredible. Well acted for the most part. Some of the ""bit"" roles were memorable. Wouldn't buy it because of the disappointment at the ending but I did sit through it."
3,HISTORICALLY FASCINATING DRAMATICALLY NOT,"Such a very thin story line in a colorful and colossal documentary-like depiction of mid 19th Century New York City. The camera's sweeping view of the city is an astounding sensual experience, but the final hour of the film drags terribly as the plot is chiseled down to a very weak romance and a Popeye and Bluto-like duel to the finish. The historical accuracy is alarmingly dead-on target, if my American History college course is any indication."
1,"Not Worth One's Admiration, Sympathy or Pity!","You'll need a strong stomach for this one. No doubt there was a deep seated prejudice against the Irish immigrants in the 19th century, there was crime in New York, anti-Lincoln feeling, and race riots occurred there also. But this movie made one think that there was nothing but hate, poverty and riots in Manhattan. Don't believe it!It is hard to know what the movie was trying to say. Was it a social statement or a Hamlet-like tale about revenge. Everyone was shown as corrupt including the Mayor and his people, the leaders of the gangs, the police and the armed forces, the outstanding newspaper publisher in the City and the protagonist and his love interest. How did the City ever get to the 20th century?The movie had little focus, lots of violence, mostly unnecessary violence, and there was no one worth one's admiration, sympathy or pity."
4,One of the Best flims of the year!,From this flim comes a wonderful tale of love and hatred. In a wonder preformence by Leonardo DiCaprio and Danail Day-Lewis as the Irish fight the natives for a small part of a America for themselfs. This flim will keep you watching untill the last mintue with you fingers clenched. Gangs of New York is a must see flim!
5,Just incredible,I didn't care for Cameron Diaz. My husband and I agreed that she looked misplaced throughout the film.Leonardo DiCaprio was stunning. Daniel Day-Lewis was THE MOST OUTSTANDING EVER!! Should have won the Oscar. Just an incredible character. Scorsese did such an awesome job.This film has pertinent themes even for today. THe end is just so eloquent...I can't wait to see it again!
3,Disappointing and Disjointed,"Long, winding and ultimately boring. Hard to follow, the plot makes no sense, goes nowhere slowly. Great cast and a wonderful period piece, watch for 20 minutes and then turn off."
1,Gore Instead of Lore,"I HATED this movie! It starts with brutality, extreme violence, bloodshed and plays that theme over and over again throughout the movie. The killing is drawn out and overemphasized. The costuming for the first scene was also outrageously stylized and inauthentic with too many people wearing them. Nudity and sex is also overdone. Breasts all over the place, triage, women hanging on men over and over again. Too much of everything, except story. The only two positive things I can comment about this movie is that Daniel Day-Lewis put in a wonderful performance as ""The Butcher"" and that I learned that Five Points was abysmally poor, a violent and iniquitous place. I suspect this movie does not fully represent all the population. There had to be poor immigrants who were desperately trying to live honest lives and had some sense of decency. I suspect this movie wants to emphasize the violence and corruption, which it does to overplay."
1,leonardo dicaprio is the best,"leo deserves more than oscar!His acting proves it!Hopefully someday the Academic jury will understand it that how leo is talented!he is a great actor!that`s it...End of discussion!About Gangs of new york,I must say that it is a huge film!I`m sure*with best wishes for the most talented actor of our generation,leo!"
2,it was ok at best,if it wasn't for Daniel Day Lewis then I wouldn't even waste my time given this film more than Half a star.this film was a complete all over the place mess for the most part.it never really got going in any direction.Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't bringing nothing to the Mix&While Cameron Diaz is Eye Candy that ain't gonna work for a film that clocks in as long as this one does.Martin Scorsese has done far better work on off days than this film.
1,Sucktacular!,"This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I went into the theater, expecting to see something with a storyline . . . but I walked out not only feeling dissappointed, but violated. Not only should you not purchace this DVD, you should write to the director and demand the US public's dignity back. This movie sucked. Don't buy it."
1,"When I bought this it said that it was in great condition. Well, when I received it the case was broken making it unwatchable.",This was a crappy purchase. Tape case broken so unable to watch I was very disappointed as I really wanted to watch this movie.
1,"awful move, really gory and just plain boring","too much blood and gore, the story gets dragged out wayyyy too long. makes you feel like you just wasted your life watching garbage"
2,Barely watchable,Other than Daniel Day-Lewis' good performance there is little to recommend this movie. Both Dicaprio and Cameron Diaz are brutally miscast and the story falls apart after the first hour. Good cinematography and Scorcese's vision of Manhattan in the 1800's may be worth a look but ultimately this is a huge disappointment.
2,Could have been 20x better,"The first 50 minutes of the movie were great. The last 50 minutes were great. The middle?? Absolutely horrific. I was totally intrigued with the story for the first part, then the middle just went to hell with a focus on leonardo decaprio and cameron diaz. The last hour was good, but I was still too bored and irritated from seeing the middle to enjoy it!! Watch the first hour of the movie then skip to the last hour and you'll get the same story without the trash in the middle that gives absolutely nothing to enjoy."
2,There's A Much Better Movie on the Same Theme,"I agree with all the other reviewers below who were disappointed in this movie. They have spelled out all the reasons why I, too, was let down by it.I also agree with a previous reviewer who recommended instead the great Brazilian movie ""City of God"". That person is right: ""City"" is everything ""Gangs"" should have been. It brilliantly tells the story of two generations of violent gangsters in a squalid, no-hope slum, and how people got sucked into a life of crime and could never escape. It is an unforgettable movie, unlike Scorsese's recent dud."
1,Terrible,"Don't buy into the hype, this was one of the worst movies of 2002. The acting was marginal, except for Daniel Day Lewis who did a great job. The story line was terrible. The script is terrible. How much symbolism do you need in one movie? I would not suggest this movies to one person, it'll have you wishing you had 2 hours back in your life."
4,"""Gangs Of New York"" Review","I don't see how people are saying this isn't a great film. This is most deff. a classic of our time! I agree, it is kind of long and violent, but it has to be to give the ""full effect"". I recommend seeing this, all-in-all it's a great movie."
2,Less than satisfied,"I found the Gangs of New York rather disappointing, especially after the numerous Golden Globe nominations and glowing reviews. Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz saved the film. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was far less admirable than his performance in Catch Me If You Can.The editing was terrible with many of the transitions between scenes rather disjointed and choppy. In addition, the mentions of the Civil War did little to enhance the film. Eliminating the ill explained and poorly tied in portions of the film would have saved at least 30 minutes and the movie.The cinematography left quite a bit to be desired. The scenery was obviously comprised of painted back-drops and poorly designed sets.Overall, I was less than impressed and rather disappointed as I expected far more from Martin Scorsese."
1,Has Scorsese befallen the fate of Woody Allen?,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of Gangs of New York. I have seen every Scorsese movie since Taxi Driver, and have loved them all. I particularly like the variety of his work, from Kundun to Age of Innocence to Goodfellas. I thought him to be the Sondheim of the cinema.I was very disappointed with Gangs. I did not care for the characters. The plot meandered. Only the last shot with the Brooklyn Bridge lived up to his past work.Diaz and DiCaprio were out of their league. Only Daniel Day-Lewis delivered. He gave a remarkable performance as the Butcher, but that alone could not save the movie.Has Scorsese befallen the fate of Woody Allen? Another once-admired director whose name alone brought me to the movie theatre."
2,It was just too long to love,As I said this movie was too long! I liked it but after 2 hours I was ready for them to get it over with. I would not recommend it.
2,"Maybe I'm Not ""Hip"" enough for Scorcese Movies [Except ""Goodfellas""]","Too Long... too dark.... cinematography too ""artificial"" looking....characters were generally unlikeable....DayLewis over acts... my opinion, movie highly over rated."
4,Gangs of New York,"A Supurb Film. The only reason i didnt give it a 5 is because Gangs of New York tended to drag a bit during the middle stages of the movie. And also, i think we could've done without the romance. But still, there is more good then bad in this movie. Top acting throughout the movie, with special mention to Daniel Day-Lewis with his supurb effort with his character. He really played the part well. We all know DiCaprio looks like a nancy boy, but he got away with it. He isnt as bad in this movie, as everyone says he is. Im not a fan of his, but i think he deserves a little more praise then he is getting. Cameron Diaz is always good to look at. So she gets a passing grade too :) Its a very violent movie, so its not for everyone, but overall a thoroughly entertaining movie."
4,Gangs of New York,"This was a very fun, interesting and violent movie. The acting was good. I thought Leonardo DiCaprio wasnt as bad as everyone is making out... but he did a good enough job to maintain his character in the movie in my mind. Cameron Diaz is always sexy in her movies, she was good to look at, and her character was a very interesting one. The best peice of acting came from Daniel Day-Lewis. He really got his character going the best, which was a joy to watch. The only problem i had with the movie, was that it seemed to lag a bit during the middle stages . It seemed that Scorcese was filling in the time with nothing scenes, but it comes out of the hole with a good ending. All the gangs in the movie are so different, which is cool. I also liked the firefighters :))) A very violent movie, but it doesnt go over the top. Very similar to the violence of Braveheart. Overall a good film."
2,Not believable,"Maybe the portrayal of NY in the 1800's was accurate, but still very poorly done. The movie lacks credibility. I had a hard time sitting through it. No one character engages the viewer; and no coherent theme emerges. Chaotic and busy...not one that I recommend."
3,Not Up To Expectations,"This was a so so movie with just a lot of star actors and actresses. Their perfomance was not poignant, touching, or emotional. There was nothing thrilling. I had no idea if the director wanted to make the evil character really evil or a good man with a justified reason for what he did. The ending was incomplete and left me unsatisfied with the movie."

1,Simply Awful,"I cannot believe how much I disliked this movie. I'm really surprised. So much potential. If only it had a more believeable story and characters worth devoting three hours of my life to. Alas, I found it outlandish and the people cartoonish. The word atrocious actually comes to mind. For some strange reason I kept expecting them to break out into song (DDL in particular). And I kept staring at that horrific ""moustache"" he was sprouting. I'm not usually this harsh, but, God, it was so bad I can't help it."
1,"movie & special features ""divided"" in both discs","I didn't like this edition,well, sort of,first, the edition is ok, but WHY did Miramax ""divided"" the movie and the special features in both discs???Its ilogical!it'd be better if disc one had the entire movie and comentaries and disc two the rest of the special features, that would be LOGICAL but nooo... They did a messwhat do you think??????I live in Mexico and region 4 of this DVD is better (and that's strange 'cause I prefer region 1)"
2,Only for Lewis,"Daniel-Day Lewis is riveting here, but the love story is terrible, and Diaz is especially bad. Leo is miscast -- he rarely works in period movies -- and Scorcese's vision of a nasty, messy New York is entertaining, if mildly depressing. But you watch this film pretty much for Lewis' magnetic performance."
2,A One-sided Vision of Humanity,"Technically and artistically brilliant, the film suffers from a warped perspective of humanity. Only dark motivations are portrayed: hatred, vengeance, lust, desire for power. Forgiveness, love, gentleness, nobility--all are missing. (Save for one brief moment for the character elected mayor, and that ends in 20 seconds with a hatchet in his back.) Even the missionaries appear to be deluded fools. The major characters show no sign of personal growth (other than power, skill in murder, etc.).If you want to watch a movie that seeks to convince you that people are animals--that even President Lincoln was the moral equal of a bloodthirsty gang leader, then this is the film for you.If you want a film that shows the redemption of the violent, check out ""The Mission"" with Robert DeNiro and Jeremy Irons."
2,You have got to be KIDDING me,"As a fan of all types of movies in various genres and with a taste for historical drama I just can't believe this flick is even considered to be passable. About the only redeeming quality was the expose on the Five Points in the mid 1800's. Insipid plot lines, wacky dramatic acting (are we expected to believe the DD Lewis character is crying over a dead rabbit after dispatching a dozen men at least with various knives, hence his name the butcher...). See it if you must but don't expect to be impressed, Scorcese was out to lunch on this one..."
3,"2 Discs! 3 stars for the product, 5 stars for the movie!",This is a review of the product and how the movie is split up into two discs. I bought this movie because I like it so the movie obviously gets 5 stars. Great actors and some historical truth to it like the name at least of that corrupt mayor. It's a movie and it never claimed to be a documentary.
2,Too Much of A Good Thing,"This movie was very boring to say the least! Don't get me wrong the plot was actually quite good, but it was just too stretched out of a movie to enjoy (even The Lord of the Rings movies are fun to watch). This movie should have been an hour and a half...not three hours. In closing, if you like movies that are unispired and are headache inducing, then look no further because this movie is for you."
1,"Gangs of New York, Explodes on the Screen","Gangs of N.Y. explodes on the screen 'cause it's a totalBOMB ! It's way too long, the actors are way over the topor just uncaring. The script is hokey, the dialog is fakeand DiCaprio must have realy needed the money. The onlygood film he ever made was ""This Boy's Life"" in 1993.DO NOT buy, rent or get Pay per View for Gangs of New York.The photography was beautiful...That's it !Russ"
2,"D.D. Lewis, yes! Everyone else, no.","Daniel Day Lewis is the best thing going for this oddball film. Beyond his performance I didn't find much to like about the story or even the overblown ""historic"" look of the film. The scenes involving troops during the riots look stilted and unauthentic; a far cry from other films that portray the Civil War period. Scorsese is a complete failure at combat scenes. The love story between DiCaprio's and Diaz's characters are woefully predictable and downright silly. Leaving her on the cutting room floor would have greatly improved the film. Let's face it; Scorsese is way past his prime. Time to retire, Marty."
2,Over Indulgent and Poorly Acted,"The only reason this one doesn't get 1 star is Daniel Day Lewis who is impressive in this movie as he is in all others. Dicaprio and Diaz however are laughably bad in this, and the movie is meandering and often seems lost in it's own murk. I would only reccomend this to Day Lewis fans, Scorsese fans should skip it because it doesn't add anything to what he has done, this one is kind of an embarassment. Scorsese has had his great films like Goodfellas and Taxi Driver, that's why I've been confused with his recent stuff, The Aviator wasn't that great either. My advice is simple...Dicaprio, DeNiro you are not."
1,What a stinker...,"This film aspires favourably as the all-time worst movie that I have ever wasted time watching. One big mess of unbelievable casting, acting and action - set in equally untrustworthy locations, with a non-existent storyline. Overall impression: ""The Pirates of Penzance"" meets ""Spiderman"" w/o the music.The weirdest thing is, that the film is barred of morality. As a consequence, it conveys no feelings to the spectator. There are no villains and no heroes - all characters are ""bad"" to some extent. The violence becomes senseless gore without empathy or sympathy, and the ""romantic moments"" are reduced to showing of bare flesh in paparazzi style. You're not involved in the action, but are prone to wonder how on earth 2 hours and 45 minutes can feel like an eternity."
3,Overlong and underwhelming,"This film shows the violence which was prevalent in New York in the mid-1800's. ""Native"" Americans are pitted against the immigrant Irish and men being drafted into the Union army rebel against joining a war that they care little about. There is plenty of fighting and plenty of blood. The conflicts are personified by Leonardo DiCaprio who swears vengeance on the man who killed his father when he was a young boy and left him to be brought up in an orphanage. As a grown man he seemingly joins the man they call The Butcher, while plotting his death. Cameron Diaz is the love interest who leaves The Butcher to join DiCaprio. This is a dark film, both visually and content-wise and it will probably not be taken as seriously by viewers as the film-makers might wish."
5,"freedom of speech?not in the us,...",...gangs of new york: a great movie!go and see it and you will understand americas human nature and motivation that keeps you alive:fear......democracy:welcome to the jungle!
4,Enjoyable but lacked depth,"This one was more fun to read, though not as compelling, as McNab's better-known Carol Ashton mysteries. Lesbian undercover agent Denise Cleever is a much easier character to relate to than the closed-off austere Inspector Ashton, despite the fact that the character is not nearly as well developed as Ashton's. She's also much more realistic than McNab's Kylie Kendall character, who, though fun, is a little much for my tastes. The unresolved ending of the romance is disappointing. Still, it is McNab, so definitely worth a read."
5,Goes Down Easy,"I'm a little embarrassed that I first heard about this band on NPR (it makes me feel even older and squarer than I am!) and embarrassed, too, that I responded like a Pavlov dog to the Beatlesque surface of their sound. But after several listens, I heard a lot more going on. These are carefully crafted songs with creative parts and changes in spades, but the band's not afraid to muss up the pop perfection with rasps, distortions, howls, and lazy off-time solos that give their music more of the urgency of indie rock. They recorded Easy Beat on tape, and the production has that special warmth and sense of space you just can't get with digital. I don't picture these guys as gearheads fiddling in a studio for months to sound like ""Abbey Road"" (Elephant 6, anyone?). They seem more like a bunch of close, talented musicians who've played together for hours to hone their songs. The CD hasn't come out of my player for weeks, & can't wait to hear them live."
3,Easy Beat - Dr. Dog,This CD was purchased for my Grandson and his Wife. I am not really into todays music as much as the Grandkids are but I believe it is what they wanted and think they will enjoy it.
5,Best of the best,"Wohawo what is this. This is some F* great cd. Hearing that sound now when the bubble pop is everywhere, that's great. Good raw beat's with great rythm. I give a great prob's to Dr Dog for doing it his way, or they."
2,AVERAGE AT BEST,"THIS CD WAS AVERAGE AT BEST. THE CD SOUNDS FLAT, I BELIEVE IT'S NOT FOR THE TALENT OF THE BAND BUT THE PRODUCTION VALUES.IF THEY COULD GET A PRODUCER TO DISPLACE THE SOUNDS IT WOULD MAKE FOR A MUCH BETTER LISTEN."
2,Ever seen a made at home movie? Nows your chance!,"... Now how do you start a review of this kind of movie. Was it a movie? When all of a DOZEN towns people at the gate are waving farewell and sending the would be heros into battle against the (wonderfully computer rendered)dragons doesn't that just somehow seem sad. We six Heros will die so that the dragons won't eat the rest of you! Thats right all 11 of...oh Im sorry didn't see you there, ALL TWELVE of you. I especially like how in this town of twelve+heros there happens to be a traveling deadly martial arts guy, a beautiful girl with a huge crossbow on wheels,(talk about envy) and the robin hood guy, except he's actually from outside the town. So I'm going to stop now before I cry... Yes it was that bad. But as always watch it for the Heck of it and try not to be upset about time lost in a vigilant attempt to make sense out of the dragon storm movie thing..experience thing."
1,BURNT OUT,"This would be an exciting film for children. For adults: Cheesy script, poor acting and campy stuntwork/camerawork/special effects."
1,It just doesn't get any worse than this!,"Oh my, this movie was awful. It has the feel throughout of a group of first time actors playing medieval dress-up and dragons for the camera. The special effects consist of computer-generated dragons and an extreme overuse of people's backs getting set on fire... that's pretty much it. The plot is also very weak and typical. The fighting scenes are horribly choreographed and the acting is so bad that it looks like first time efforts for every actor except for the two kings and Theldag. Picture Ben Stiller with a slight beard, medieval clothes, and a wig. That's the hero in this calamity of a movie. There's also the typical trite and very poor attempt at humor spattered throughout also. This is definitely a low budget title. It's also in 4:3 full screen only. I consider this movie purchase one of the worst I have ever made, but it was cheap. You get what you pay for."
2,"dragons are cool, this movie is not","I watched this movie because it has Angel Boris in it, and I love Angel Boris. But let's face it, if Angel Boris is in a movie, that's a good sign that the movie is going to suck. Not because she is a bad actress, but she's an average actress who probably can't land the good roles. But she's hot, so who cares?The only real reason to watch this movie is John Rhys Davies. He enjoys himself thoroughly playing a nasty, scheming bad guy, and gets most of the good lines in the film.The dragons are done with much better CGI than I would have expected from a Sci-Fi Channel movie, but the film makers must have spent 90% of their budget on the dragons, because the rest of the film is almost comically under-produced. There's like 10 people in the village where the king lives. The lack of budget shows.The acting? The plot? The dialogue? Well, let's say I've seen much, much worse. I still love Angel Boris though."
4,Great indoor kids Bball hoop,"Pleased with product, purchased for 10 year old who loves it. Mounts easily on top of one of our doors, although if your door frame sticks out (recessed door), the top of the backboard may hit the door frame and the door may not close. This should not be a problem for most ""flush"" doors. The ball is great and backboard is nice and large so play is great. My main problem was that getting the net inserted through the eye holes was a total pain. i had to redo the net several times before getting it to stay."
1,Sorry Excuse for Fun,"Pros: This backboard and rim look great. The colors are bright and the net is of good quality.Cons: The rim is made of cheap plastic. I have two 4 year old boys who love to play and have their own small leather basketballs. The rim has broken twice in 4 weeks. We tried crazy glue to repair it the first time. After the second break, we trashed it and purchased another one hoping we had just gotten a ""bad apple"". This rim broke within a week. We will not be purchasing this brand again and would not recommend it unless maybe you are using a nerf ball."
2,Nurf Hoop,"The net does not stay on. Otherwise, it is a sturdy, fun hoop. that is my only complaint, but it is significant because the net falls off so often, my son ends up shooting without the net which isn't as much fun."
1,Lousy.,"This is poorly made. The backboard hangs at an angle, so it does not allow the door to close properly. The hoop has thirteen hooks, and the net has twelve loops, which is comepletely stupid. The ball is cheap. Stay away."
3,Good quality 4 price.,the backboard & rim was bigger than what I thought it was going to be it was solid and my son loves it?
3,A typical Elizabeth Lowell,"Dont get me wrong, I love her books but I wish the women in them played just a little bit harder to get, they start off tough and then crumble. Just once I would love to see the hero guessing for a little longer."
2,technical info on jade:the result is futile!,"I totally agree with some reviewers who said that Ms Lowell's recent works were weak and lack of spirit. I, personally gave up buying her books after Donovan series. When I checked the attitudes of other reviewers, I realized that this is a kind of trend actually. Donovan series are supposed to be good, however too much info about gemology (obviously she has lots of books on this issue) is really beyond boring. One reader had emphasized that Ms Lowell is either very good or very poor. I completely agree with her. The earlier books (even the naive ones) of Ms Lowell are much better than the recent ones.I could not see any character development in this one. To me the whole story was uninteresting and shallow. Too much cliche! Once again..."
5,wonderful,I read this book years ago and recently bought it for my kindle fire. I already knew how the plot played out but didn't care. This book is amazing and Lowell is and will always been my favortie author!
4,Better Than Amber Beach,"I must say that Jade Island, the second book in the Donovan series, is a big improvement over Amber Beach, the first book. Jade Island is about Kyle Donovan, the youngest son of the six Donovans. Kyle meets up with Lianne, who is being accussed of stealing the legendary Jade Emperor's Tomb. Together Kyle and Lianne must convince the government that Lianne is innocent, while falling in love at the same time. Jade Island is full of excitement, laughs, and plenty of ""heat"" between Kyle and Lianne. If you read Amber Room and was disappointed, as I was, this one will make you want to finish the series."
4,Fast paced page turner. Wonderful.,It was great for those of us that don't know all that much about jade. It was very accurate and she paid great attention to detail as well as developing well rounded characters that you could actually picture in your mind without wondering if they were behaving according to the way they were described. YOU could actually understand their motivation and their reactions. I think it was an excellent book.
2,Disappointing,"The synopsis sounds quite interesting, yet the many cultural discrepancies totally discourages the reader. I do give credit for Lowell on the research of jade. Many authors have yet to learn to deal with working and understanding the eastern cultures and Lowell is one of them."
3,quite disappointed,"Lowell did an excellent job on the subject of jade, yet she totally missed the target on the Chinese culture. Never have I heard of women feeding men in this day and age as described in the book. Having mistresses is not a cultural difference between west and east, it is one of the things that the two cultures have in common. Other than the many more cultural discrepancies in the book it wasn't that bad. Predicable with a bit of action to pull you through."
3,Not As Good As I Hoped,"This is my first EL book. It began very well but by the second chapter I was very tired of hearing over and over again about Lianne's family longing.I realize Jade is the main subject of the book, however, so much detailed discription could have been left out. I skipped much of the detail to get to more of the story.The first 2/3rds of the story moved very slowly but the last third was very good.Excellent story idea if told by someone else. This all true, I will be the next book if it's about the same family."
3,Good book but not Elizabeth Lowell's best,I enjoyed reading this book but thought it was more about jade and not about Lianne and Kyle and their romance. I felt like I was reading a book on the jade trade and Chinese culture. I did not feel that there was any warmth and romance between the two characters. Parts of the story were to detailed or not enough.
2,Nothing happens for the first 150 pages,"The Only series of books by Elizabeth Lowell are all high on adventure and romance. This one (and Amber Beach as well) is a dull report on precious stone imperfections, with creepy characters that I could not get excited about, and a totally confusing ending that seems to be just a way to set up the reader for the next book in the series, Pearl Cove. Most of the story is yakking at a boring cocktail party before a jade auction. The biggest thrill in the book is discovering machine made nicks in a jade phallus. If you think that sounds weird, you're right, and you didn't have to plow through an additional 75 pages describing tiny nicks in more jade erotica... all in all it was really bad taste, and not worth reading. I recommend Elizabeth Lowell's Winter Fire instead."
2,There goes my monye :(,"I beg of you, do not buy this book unless you KNOW something about paint shop. Its ok in the sence that it has some nice pic's, but its not that good. It has to much detail on topics that dont need lots of detail. Its a pain to read. If you have to buy a Paint Shop Book buy ""Paint Shop Pro 6 Visual Insight"". Its just better and you will save some cash."
1,Had 2 wks. and it now won't work,"Well I hate to be the one to leave a bad review, but I must. My husband and I bought this fridge and received it 2 wks. ago. Yesterday, my husband noticed that it was not making any noise and realized that the insides of the fridge were no longer cool. The compressor was so hot that it could not be touched. We unplugged it and let it cool down and thought that it would maybe come back to life. No such luck! It's dead.I have requested to send it back but I no longer can find the packaging slip so that I have the address to send it back to. We will see how returning it goes, but for that kind of $$. I just hope that they take it back and give me a refund."
3,Noisy.,"The unit seems to work o.k. It is noisy & seems to cycle on & off more than one would think it should. When the unit arrived, the freezer unit had come loose & we had to reattach it."
4,Does the job nicely,"Purchased for a shared office location and other than the small freezer issue others have mentioned, it is a good value for the money. I see it getting plenty of use over the next few years. Mine did arrive rather scraped up, but it was not worth the hassle to send back, or I'd rate it a 5."
1,Stopped Working in Less than a Year,"I purchased this for the office in April of 2008; it stopped working about three weeks ago. I am waiting to hear back from Amazon... Not sure if there's any kind of warranty, but it stopped working after a little over ten months of use."
2,Note that the interior is not for this fridge,"I think Haier must have issued some funky photos to the distributors/resellers of their items.The freezer/interior photo of this item is the one for the IGLOO of the same capacity.The Haier model has a freezer that runs the full width of the refrigerator.That being said, I am at a loss as to what model will actually arrive in good shape and WORK."
3,Damaged box and product,"I purchased this refrigerator as a gift for my husband for use at his office. The box it was shipped in was quite damaged when it arrived. There were some dents in the product as a result. Surprisingly, the refrigerator still works. I would have returned the product for one that was not damaged but we were not able to send it back because the box was torn and ripped so badly."
3,Same Ol' Story - Damaged During Shipment,"Like many other customers who ordered this refrigerator, mine also arrived damaged. One of the corners on the top was dented. It's amazing to me that the product is not packed better for shipment - there was no packing material of any kind around the top of the unit. It seems to work fine for now - and since the unit is for a bar area and sits under a counter (where the damage will be hidden) I decided to keep it rather than go through the hassle of returning it. Sounds like I got off lucky compared to others ! I definitely would not order from this company again (Gizmos) - unless perhaps it was a plush toy or bag of cotton balls - definitely nothing that has a solid structure. As for my next compact refrigerator - I think it will be a GE that I pickup from Sears."
2,Shipping Problems,"I ordered this item yesterday, and it arrived only 24 hours later. Unfortunately, it arrived damaged to the point that it is unusable. A panel on the bottom is bent so that the fridge cannot sit squarely on the ground, and there are dents on the sides and corners. To be honest, I'm amazed it's not worse, as it was packed in only a plastic bag and the box, no additional packing materials.Both the size and the price are good, so I'm hoping that the replacement item that is being shipped to me will work out."
1,product arrives broken,The refrigerator arrived in a broken box. Even the delivery driver was surprised about the condition. Product was refused at delivery. I did report issue to customer service at Amazon. I did not order another unit. Other reviews did indicate that the product was arriving damaged.
2,Had it less than 2 years and it stopped working,"I bought this fridge for our small office. It got used very little and less than 2 years later, I had to replace it!!!! I went with another brand this time."
1,Still thinking about NT 4.0?? Go for 2000.,"Why would spend money on soon-to-be obsolete NT 4.0? Go for 2000 server, it will save you money."
2,A Mess,"Levy needs help. This book is incoherent and poorly constructed. Except when Levy takes a detour to unload on Heidegger, which he does wonderfully and with real passion, he meanders all over the place. The book is full of non sequitors and bizarre assertions. It is not clear at all what his point is. Must be in here somewhere.Editing: Zero Stars. Someone needed to have a quiet word with Bernard-Henri. Sentances running 39 lines are a bit much. Where is the verb?Copy Editing: Five Stars. Very Clean."
3,Great for the price,"These stools are great for counter-height bars and islands. One problem I did have is that the seat for one of the stools was warped and therefore, the seat wobbles. I don't sit on that stool. If you don't get a warped seat, these are great. Everything you purchase over the web is a gamble I guess."
5,Last Drinks as Cold as the First,These are the best! I use for beer. :) Gotta hold them by the stainless section though or the two parts easily separate and you loose your drink. Couldn't find them for a while so I bought a bunch from another site that also did monograming.
3,"It's OK, some great moments","It's a nice little journey with the band and its enjoyable seeing a bunch of guys back from suburbia to rock out after two decades.There are some great moments when the likes of Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo (among others) have a play with Mission. Maybe i am just exposing my shallow lust for live SY. Don't get me wrong, i watched Not a Photograph a couple of times, so its an intriguiing story. And its nice to see a lesser known, more adventurous band still resonanting with so many people (young and old(ish)) 20 years after the fact.I guess though being young and from New Zealand, i was hoping for more footage of live performances, historic and present. Similarly i found the 'dvd extras' a little disappointing in this respect as well. I just wish they could have jammed in a heap more footage from their recent gigs, for us antipodean folk.So in summing; its decent, but of the similar doco's i have seen, Fugazi's Instrument still shines in my mind."
2,Didn't work well,"I bought this trying to find a more natural, yet effective deodorant...I work in a laid-back job, where I can more or less move at my own pace-I am on my feet most the day, but barely moving around... This deodorant works for about an hour, and then stops. I could notice myself stinking. And like has been said, it won't work at all unless applied to PERFECTLY CLEAN skin, i.e. right out of shower and dried skin. Waste of money."
1,Rip-Off,Stated that you would get a pack of 3. Only one came. I called up The Vitamin Shoppe. They said it was Amazon's fault.They said that they have never sold it as a 3 pack. I guess that I will have to dispute it with my credit card company.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"AFTER CAREFULLY SHOPPING AROUND FOR THE BEST PRICE, I CHOSE TO BUY THIS BECAUSE IT ADVERTISED ""PACK OF 3"". WHAT ELSE WOULD 'PACK OF 3' MEAN??????? I RECEIVED ONE - FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,BEWARE!!!!!,"I contacted The Vitamin Shoppe today because my order came with only 1 deodorant instead of 3. The description states that you will get 3, but in fact you will not. Vitamin Shoppe did not even want to help me because they said that it was not their error. They told me to take it up with amazon since it was their mistake! I just know that I am NOT gonna get the short end of the stick and get ripped off!!!!"
1,NOT A PACK OF THREE -- just one!!!,"Be Warned, you will only receive one. It's fine, as far as deodorant goes, but it is not three."
1,worked on wetness but not on odor,I was really hopeful. I tried this deodorant hoping to be able to stop using the regular products with Aluminium-based ingredients.It worked great for the wetness but it did nothing for the odor. And this is not something I am willing to compromise on. A deodorant must solve both problems.
1,Save your money!,This deodorant smells like smelly arm pits even before you put it on. Don't waste your money on this product.
1,Terribly ineffective (for me),"This deodorant doesn't work for me at all, and I so want it to. Even combined with Weleda deodorant spray (I have both the Sage and the Citrus) I smell foul less than 1/2 way through the day. Sigh."
5,Effective,"This was for my husband's use. I could tell it's effective! Also, this does not leave hardened deposits on clothing like so many of the roll-on do."
4,Deodorant when you need it!,Crystal Body Deodorant is great. I guess what I like most about it is that there is no competition between my after shave and my deodorant. And it works for this guy!
3,Meh,"As for it's effectiveness, it's okay. I'm not smelly, but on a hot summer day, I don't come home super fresh either. It has no scent, which can be good or bad depending on your preference. It appears to aggravate my shaving bumps more than other deoderants.The ball on mine doesn't roll, so I squeeze out some of the liquid and then wipe it on with the stuck ball. Because it's slippery, this works fine.Meh, but EWC rates it highly and I prefer this to the chemicals in alternative options."
2,Not what I expected..,"I thought that this ""crystal body deodorant"" would be like the last one I bought, which lasted me YEARS!However, instead of a solid crystal that was pushed up by a plastic screw, this item is a roller-ball on top of a bottle of liquid. How is THAT a ""crystal body deodorant""?Moreover, my underarm hairs sometimes get caught in the roller ball, which is NOT a pleasant sensation.Overall, this was a big disappointment."
2,Didn't work for me,"Okay, I'm not one of those people that goes and reviews a natural deodorant expected to get an antiperspirant, but this deodorant just didn't work at all for me. I've used other natural deodorants that at least deodorize the BO a bit, like they're supposed to do. This product was basically useless to apply alone because without being combined with something else, it was as if I wasn't wearing anything. When I came home at night my armpits (and my clothes) would smell putrid. I'd have to wash everything after wearing it only once. Perhaps it was because it was unscented, I don't know. Also, you can't reapply it throughout the day--this will do nothing to get rid of body odor and will also contaminate the stick with your smell (hence the ""only apply to clean underarms"" directions on the label. And trust me, you'll need to reapply with something after using this!Maybe it was just me--there were a lot of positive reviews, maybe it depends on your body chemistry."
4,Crystal Body Deodorant Roll-on,This product is one of the very few non aluminum products for women on the market and it works better than the other one we found.
5,This product is awesome.,"I rarely review products that I purchase and I feel silly making an exception for a deodorant but this product is...well...exceptional. I've tried to make sure that everything that I put in and on my body is free of possibly harmful chemicals. Deodorant has always been my one hold-out because frankly, I'm stinky. I work in a Doctor's office so it's important that I not smell bad but even with serious anti-perspirents I'd be pretty rank by the end of the day. I tried this product because my husband and I are planning a family and after using several totally ineffective natural deodorants I was at a loss. I picked this stuff up and holy crap is it amazing. Even better than conventional anti-perspirents. I walk to and from work but come 5pm I don't stink at all."
4,Works pretty well.,"In an effort to stop using chemicalized deodorant, I bought this product. It works pretty well, although I had to adjust to the fact it will not stop perspiration, only odor. And it does that well, unless it's a very hot and muggy day with lots of exertion involved. With the chemical-free trade off I think it's well worth it. However, if I were giving an important presentation I would probably use my other deodorant."
1,not aluminum free!!!,"I don't know if you are aware, but All deodorants crystals, crystal deodorant roll-ons, and crystal deodorant sprays contain either: Ammonium Alum, also known as ammonium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate or Potassium Alum, also known as potassium aluminum sulfate dodecahydrate. Both potassium and ammonium alum have the same potential toxicity as Aluminum Chlorohydrate there for its an Aluminum salt just like aluminum chlorohydrate. Crystal deodorants are no better for you than antiperspirants containing aluminum chlorohydrate."
3,Good death/black metal but lacks true skill,Imortal souls is said to be a cross between inflames and children of bodom and I can say that is true. But where are the solo's and complicated guitar work ? Seems like it is non-existent in most songs. But all over this is a good metal all the less.
4,"Very good, even though a bit sci-fi dated","This is from back of the book:On a distant planet in the distant future. When all the galaxies are colonized, John Craig, a young space diplomat, is captured by interplanetary pirates and sold into slavery. On Kossar, where boredom and absolute power have driven the rulers to a special kind of madness, Craig is auctioned off to the exquisite Lady Morgan Sidney, a beautiful, sensual woman. He soon makes his way from the hellish slave mines into her bed in the tower of her castle. And it is here, under the strange castle, that he finds the secret that may bring about the end of man in the galaxy..."
3,There are no easy answers,"Job is a book more about questions than answers. Be Patient attempts to analyze the message of Job and says there are no easy answers. Put together in seminar format, Wiersbe outlines Job chapter by chapter with interludes between speakers (God, Satan, Job, his three friends and Elihu). Unfortunately, the good points are weighed down with leading questions. Wiersbe attempts to say that all life works to the glory of God but with no feeling or compassion. He gives questions pat answers. His heavy handed manner of pushing his point leaves little room for interpretation. Wiersbe says Job is a book about questions, but the questions he asks have only one answer. It isn't that way in real life."
2,No noticeable improvement,"The first time I bought this was when I was on a cruise ship. I wasn't sure if it was doing anything, but I figured I'd try one more package. The capsules I received must be old, because the liquid inside for every one of them has little white clumps of hardened matter in them. So....no noticeable improvement, quality control not great, I wouldn't waste my money on this again."
2,Maybe for dry skin?,"Similar to the other reviewer, this product makes the skin on my chin breakout (and on my neck if I accidently get some on my neck). Perhaps it is better for folks with dry skin. (I have normal skin.) It does smell very nice (both the day and night capsules) and makes my face feel smooth, but I won't buy more because of the breakouts."
5,Wonderful Movie!,"Whoever says this movie is confusing or dumb is a liar! I first saw this movie when I was 10. I understood what was going on and everything. It is one of my favorite movies. It's full of action, whitty lines, etc. I really enjoy this movie, I think it's something for everyone, a little romance, action, nudity, bondage, dancing, fighting, explosion, etc! I think this movie would be great for any sci-fi fan, action fan, action hero, anybody and everybody!"
3,For the High Price the quality should have been better!,"Shipping was great and fast, my only gripe is that for the very high cost of this DVD the quality should have been much better. Aside from that being the Videophile that I am these are some of the issues I have to deal with."
3,Split Second,"This film is in need of a re-release. I saw it on VHS nearly 20 years ago. It's an OK film, a little dark and gritty. I can't recommend paying these prices for it though. Just wait. They'll release it again for less than 20 dollars."
5,A DVD must!,"Isn't it wonderful that it is finally onDVD?! Ordered it once it popped up! Why does one need to drink alot of coffee, eat even more chocolate and fantasize about 'bigger guns'?! Well, if you found yourself to be Rutger Hauer's partner, working the beat in London (with most of London being underwater) you would know! The quips and one-liners are outstanding. Even though this movie wouldn't qualify for an Oscar...or any other cinematography award...it is a must-see for all! Read some of the other reviews for more details...and the then buy this movie to find out why we love it. Thanks to all of you for convincing the movie-industry to put this on DVD!!"
