4,Overall good,"Daily use for VOIP for 1.5 years.Pro: Clear sound.Pro: Generally comfortable. Even over some pairs of glasses. Typical use 30 min-5 hours in a single use.Pro: Comes with a soft bagPro: Like the lighted mute button on the cord. Handy for not letting a customer know that I have muted.Con: Not comfortable over all of my glasses. After only 30 minutes, can be very uncomfortable over some glasses.Con: After 1.5 years of steady use, one of the speakers in the earphones is going out. Perhaps 1.5 years is a reasonable expectation for lifetime of the product. I am now replacing it."
3,It works...,"It works. Doesn't fit my head very well, and there are multimode bluetooth/wireless USB headsets that perform just as well for the same price."
4,Plantronics portable headset for dictation and listening,"Plantronics Foldable USB Stereo Headset (Optimized for Laptop Use) (Audio 470 USB)It works very well, is light and I can fold it up, take it with me and use it with my laptop wherever I am.It is the only one that I have had that works well with Dragon Naturally Speaking."
1,Plantronics DSP-400 USB Foldable Stereo Headset,Beware of the advertisement. It came without a USB connection and I sent it back.
2,Plantronics DSP-400,I am starting a call center using VOIP technology. Two of the headsets I purchased did not work out of the box. A third headset received audio from one ear only. I do however like the ease of access of the volume and mute control. I would not suggest using these in a space with more than a few agents. Clients can not hear the call. We switched to the Audio DSP 400 without the audio interface and this set seems to perform better.
2,Slips off your head,"I tried to like this headset but in the end I returned it to Amazon. Why? It's heavier than I thought and doesn't grip your head. As a result, when talking on the phone and working you can't tilt your head down. If you do, it tries to fall off your headAlso it is supposed to fold up and be portable. Yes, it folds up. However the big volume control and the folded headset are huge. Not something I can simply slip into my laptop bag and hit the road.Sorry Plantronics! Try again."
2,Works....but thats about it,"This is a very shoddy product. The volume control and mute controller built into it failed within a week. The headset itself doesnt lock in place and folds up annoyingly easy, usually pinching hands or fingers when it does so. The cables are extremely cheap, and I have no doubt will begin failing soon.I wouldnt recommend or buy this product again."
5,Excellent Headphones for all music and voice applications,Plantronics DSP-400 Digitally-Enhanced USB Foldable Stereo Headset and SoftwareThis product surpasses my expectations in user-friendliness and ease of use. There was no software necessary and worked by simply plugging it in. The sound quality for MP3's is superb and it works well with Skype and other voice and chat programs. I recommend it highly.
4,"Excellent sound quality, but the wires get tangled sometimes","I bought this headset after my work bought me the fancy wireless Plantronics for use with Dragon Naturally Speaking 9. I have found that the accuracy of the program picked up dramatically and the audio sound quality is excellent. My only quip, and this is a small one, is that the wires get tangled often, but that could be the users fault."
3,Worked for a while...,"I've used this headset for PC gaming for about a year now (I think it's been a year) and for the most part it has been great. Recently one of the channels went out, so I only have sound out of one side. I think a there's a short in the little volume control knob. The sound/voice was great, when it worked fine...now I need to purchase a new headset."
2,Great but Broke,"I have had 2 of these. The audio quality is amazing however both of them broke with 3 months of use. The wires from daily use seem to ""wear"" out and eventually both had ""loose wire"" syndrome where by jiggling the wire would cause audio to come in and go out. I use the headset a low to moderate amount. So if you are serious user this one is definitley out. I use it with an NEC VOIP Softphone."
4,Excellent sound quality,"The Plantronics DSP-400 is a good quality USB headset. On Macs there are no drivers to install, they work great right out of the box. The sound quality is excellent and they are terrific for Internet telephony via Skype (see [...]for software). The headset collapses and folds in half to make carrying in a computer bag easier, however, this set of hinges also makes it feel flimsy. I've been using it successfully for over a month with no problems. If I was buying today I'd opt for the slightly more expensive DSP-500 as they seem a bit sturdier than the -400 model as they don't fold and seem to have a more ridgid construction. Aside from that feature, this headset is a good bargain and the sound quality for telephony or just listening to music is terrific. The earphones rest comfortabley on top of the ear and allow for ambient room sound to enter, which is good in an office environment so you can hear your co-workers when they come into your office."
1,poor blade clamp,"The blade clamp does not will not hold blades tightly enough to let them be adequately tensioned. Tension may be sufficient for cutting VERY thin stock, but I was using this to cut away waste on dovetails, per Cosman video. Blades immediately pulled out of the blade clamp and brokeBought another fret saw without the rotating blade feature, and it works fine."
1,"poor build, get a german saw","I would concur with the other reviewer here. Clamps were stamped sheet metal wing nuts that hurt the hands and still could not hold the blade. Handle did not align with the top. When I first got mine, I thought it was faulty and got a replacement-- and the replacement was equally misaligned. I got myself a German saw the next week.For $25 that x-acto wants, instead, pay $20 and get a german/french/swiss saw from riogrande (or many another jewelery supply house). You'll do much better. I'm disappointed; the japanese usually build better things."
5,Head of Femur hits it on the head!,Head of Femur's debut album Ringodom or Proctor is excitingly experimental and yet is back to the basics good old fashioned rock and roll. The tunes are catchy and the lyrics wild and crazy. The blending of vocals and instruments is top-notch. This band sounds like they are having fun and that makes for pleasant listening. This is sophisticated rock at its best. The album receives my highest recommendation.
1,It doesn't FIT,"This is a nice kit, however the charging base and transparent cover DO NOT FIT the PSP 3000 it was purchased for. The speaker holes in the cover are in the wrong place and the cover will not clip to the PSP unit at all.The charging base has a blinding blue LED and it also DOES NOT FIT the PSP 3000, the PSP will not sit on the base and will not charge because it doesn't fit"
4,love it,"wonderful hanger. you put the bananas on the hook and they hang there. they mind their own business, dont give you any lip. i was hoping theyd do a dance or sing a song. but, no, they just hang there. but then thats what i wanted and thats what i got. isnt that what capitalism is all about? also good for hanging grapes and watermelons."
4,Good,these are some great speakers. They have very good quality. That is why I gave them a 4 star rating.
5,TWO GREAT LP'S FROM THE MASTER OF THE PIANO,"These 2 LP's from 1976 and 1977, near to the end of Phase 4 Stereo, when was on the top of the sound, of the music, of the art. I remember that I found these 2 LPs in a record store in my first trip to Washington DC. The cover of each LP was among most beautiful (with ""In the gentl hours"" and ""Love"", for American market).The arragments, as ever in each LP of Ronnie, are perfect. The mood to play piano, glorious!For us, in America, there is a surprise: ear 1 new song, in the album ""With Love and Understanding"" (for us was ""Evergreen""), not incluided in the LP for America and yes for European market: ""When a child is born"". Is a treasure!Of course I recomend this CD totally! You must have it if you love good music, spectacular mood to play piano and glorius sound, the sound of Mr. Aldrich in Phase 4 Stereo!"
3,"Not Bad, but need a second album...","How can you have an ACDC tribute album without Highway To Hell. The music on this album is very good, but is unfullfilling without the aforemenioned number. I encourage them to make a second CD with more ACDC tunes on it, to really cover all the bases."
1,ew,"i respect the whole neo-classical thing, but this cd is bad. sounds like somone sequenced the songs in their synthesizer. check out http://www.thetributeto.com/acdc/ . they perform their tributes, and do it well. i haven't heard their ac/dc tribute, but their other tributes (linkin park, 311, coldplay) are awesome."
1,Not great...at all,"I was so excited to try this and when I got it, I became very disappointed. I put it on and just as stood up to walk it started slipping. There's no grip whatsoever. Also, it bunched up ALOT...Don't buy this...you will be very unhappy"
2,NO,"Nice rug, but not at ALL what it looks like in the picture. You WILL need a rug holder, so factor that into the price."
1,This bedding is terrible,"Compared to the Kaytee, this bedding is hard and has large chunks of pine. The Kaytee bedding was soft and had very small slivers of pine. My son's hamster has difficulty moving the Brown bedding around and appears agitated all of the time now. We'll be switching back to the Kaytee brand."
1,Weak,"The Book is not Catholic. There are 10,000 Catholic Saint to chose from and 2000 years of history. Read Pope Benedict,Jesus, the Apostles and the Early Church"
1,Dead End,"Anyone who's ever had their heart broken in high school has more depth and feeling than he tries to find in talking to people. It has to come from within or it just doesn't ring true. Being in the audience of life is no position from which to write from. The problem with ""unlikely ways home"" is he never left it to find out for himself what it's all about."
3,"It really means ""Pure"" Trance I guess","Well I just finished this CD and to be honest, nothing really stuck in my head. However, they kinda overdid that synth sound. I've never heard so much of it. I was expecting it to change styles and synths (such as Tiesto's Nyana album)but they all stayed the same and it got tiresome. I'm a Trance fan but this CD just really didn't get me into a great trance mood.Some bad songs are ""Can you Hear me?"" -bad vocals, ""Venus"" -the most overplayed song. The good songs I can think of are ""Let the Leaves"" ""Remeber"" ""The Race"" and ""Too Late to Turn"" Everything else pretty much sounds like euro-cheese.If you like Vocal Trance a lot, then you might enjoy this."
3,Nothing special,"I've been listening to trance music for quite a while and i can tell you that this CD is really nothing special. All the tracks are getting old now and this is not a cd you would be impressed to showcase to your friends. Even if the tracks weren't as old, i still wouldn't recommend this cd because many of the songs are cheesy. The song"
3,very good but not great,"I am relatively new to Leslie Sansone WAH series. I LOVE LOVE the 5mile fat burning DVD. This was my 3rd purchase.*Like that it's 3 miles--so it can be a short day for me.*Like using the walk belt. it's more comfortable than i expected too.*Like Leslie and her upbeat personality*Don't like that mile 3 is too low in intensity. it's like all of mile 3 is cool down. I want 3 intense miles and then a cool down. So, mile 3 is a big disappointment.*Don't like that she hardly uses the belt. I was really looking forward to more resistance work and whe barely had us use the belt. Could have incorporated it better.*Didn't care for the interaction b/n cast, espec the whole water and towel bit. They should have stopped taping or done it more than once and edited it better. I don't mind Leslie's chatter but this aspect was annoying.Would I still buy it? Yes b/c it adds more variety to my at home dvd collection."
3,Expected a Smoother Rhythm,"Have enjoyed using Leslie's workouts as variously shown on On Demand TV, so ordered one to own. It is a good workout, however I found it somewhat awkward to follow: I prefer to get into a rhythm and follow in time with her leg movements, and it kept skipping or having unexpected changes (usually when camera off her) that threw me off and were annoying to have to correct. The bigger disappointment though it that the stretches at the end stopped short of equal movements on each side. It is fine, can make it work, it just feels less fun than it could be."
3,Not impressed,I am a huge fan of Leslie's but I was disappointed with this workout. I am an advanced walker and when Leslie boldy bragged about this being her best workout ever I was looking forward to it. Unfortunately for me it was not Leslie's best workout it was slow and hardly got you sweating or your heart rate up. I struggle with my weight so I need a really good work out all the time. If you like things nice and easy than this is the one for you but if you are like me and you need to feel that you have worked out then I would give this one a miss.
3,more resistance,"I liked this tape but already being more of the advanced walker, I didn;t get as much out of the upper body strength workout as I would have liked. I think if she offered other resistance bands to make it more challenging for interm/advanced I would have been happier. Overall I think it was a good workout, I ended up using hand weights for this one, but I kept it because I like to rotate routines with her tapes. Its great for beginners that havent done any or little upper body exercise."
3,Pulled muscle,"I liked the walking. I didn't feel the walk belt helped arms much, but after using it several days my shoulder and neck began to hurt as if I pulled a muscle. My friend had the same problem so we both quit using the walk belt."
4,Another Great Workout from Leslie!!!,"I am a big fan of Leslie's walking workouts and have experienced great results from the stomach flattening workouts. After a few weeks of using this tape, I put on a skirt one morining and noticed there was more room in the waistline!!! This tape really works to reduce the waistline. I have to admit this is one of the more boring tapes in regards to the background walkers and the dialogue...but it works!! And Leslie does have her charm and humor shining in every tape."
3,Fitness Exercise Equipment,"I really like the video and exercise belt, which I use between 3 to 5 times per week. I was hoping to use it with my husband who also enjoys walking for better health, however my husband does not think that it is gender friendly. He says the verbage is all geared towards women as well as there are no men in the video to support his theory. Well I like it anyway. If there are updated versions, that will put my husbands claims to rest, please let me know.Thanks!"
4,Walk Away Belt,"The belt and concept are amazing. It really boosts your workout experience. Prior to using, I was having difficulty losing weight. I have a healthy diet; but my job is mainly computer, sedentary work. I was doing the walk video during my breaks. Since I have been using the belt along w/the video, it has stepped up my workout and metabolism. The only problem that I have had is that the belt is quite large and the bands didn't give me enough resistance so I replaced them. I encourage anyone to use the video and belt."
4,It Felt Fabulous!,"I got the video a few days ago, and I finally got to use it today, let me tell you, what a great workout it turned out to be! It made me sweat and I feel it all over still after an hour of using it! I like the belt, it really gave it a boost. The only thing that kind of bothered me was on the stretch we only did a ""yoga inspired stretch"" on one side of the body, It would of been absolutely perfect if it weren't for that. I guess I can just repeat it myself on the other side. This video will be listed as one of my favorites from her!"
2,I do like it...,"I was enjoying this excercise until I ran it across my Physical Therapist and she said it was not a good idea to do, especially because of my shoulder injury...but oh well, I still enjoy the walking.Sandra Torres"
5,Love working out with Leslie,"I enjoy working out with Leslie. Not hard to do. I do feel the difference in my muscles, she helps me maintain my weight. The walk belt is okay, but not necessary."
4,For Leslie fans only.,"I love Leslie Sansone's DVDs and have enjoyed using this. However, I have to say that you really don't need to use this waistline belt to work this area. In many other DVDs, Leslie uses exercises which work the waistline without any props. The belt isn't even used that much in the DVD. I like it because it's a little different and it's good to use a variety of exercises. But if you are new to Leslie Sansone, this is probably not the best one to buy."
5,Excellent product,This cd comes with a belt to assist the work out. It is amazing! I would recommend this program to anyone who wants several options to work out. Great cd!
3,just good,"this dvd is good but do not think the belt is needed, it was only used a few times, so i do not think the belt is needed"
2,Exercising DVD,Little dissappointed in this DVD... It just does not seem to be enough usage of the exercising equipment that comes with the DVD.. seems like more time is spent taking hand weights in and out of the belt from your waistline than actually using the weights.. I don't know maybe it's just me... I have only used this DVD twice....
1,Wrong item,"I didn't actually receive the right item but, company not only refunded my money but,allowed me to keep the item they sent, which was from Leslie Sansone also. Was very happy about that. I would try again with this company."
5,"Great, speeded up","Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home - Walk Away Your Waistline! With 1, 2 and 3 Mile Markers (Walk Belt Included Inside!)I love most of her workouts, and vary them to keep from getting bored. I LOVE the fact that this one is speeded up to the pace of 5 miles per hour, instead of the usual 4mph. I have some older workouts with the belt, but this one is faster paced and I sweated!!!! It has the usual steps for those of us who are uncoordinated for the workouts with too many dance steps. Highly recommended, the belt adds extra resistance to add strength training to a workout."
4,Enjoyed this workout,"I've used quite a few of the videos from the Walk-Away series and this one is my favorite so far. It features a good warm-up and three brisk miles of walking. The work-out is great with or without the goofy walk-away belt.My only criticism is that during the stretching exercises after the workout, Leslie takes you through what she calls ""yoga inpired"" stretches on one side of the body, but when we switch to the other side, she doesn't repeat those stretches; she just ends after the hamstring stretch. No worries . . . I repeat the ""yoga-inspired"" stretches while she's giggling with her ""Sisters in Sweat""!"
4,Exercising with Leslie,"I have a few of Leslie Sansone's exercise tapes and I like them all. This one really gets your ""middle' involved and is a real workout. Enjoy!"
5,Excellent,Excellent... Leslie is so good in this workout. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to lose weight the right way.
3,Good walking workout but didn't care for the belt,I liked the walking workout. It's your basic walk aerobics and I love most of Sansone's videos. The one thing I didn't care for was the belt. I couldn't cinch it tight enough that it didn't move when I stretched out the bands because then it was too tight I was doing knee lifts or other movements. It just felt awkward and I did not feel like it added much to the workout.
3,Walk off the weight,"This would be a great video if Leslie Sansone wouldn't laugh so much. A friend has another CD of hers with the same complaint. The talking is ok but too loud and strident. As far as the workout I think it's good. Definitely more than just walking, it's walking and a good exercise. The first time I did it around 9pm and couldn't fall asleep. It gave me so much energy I was no longer tired and I only did the first mile."
5,Love it!,I have almost all of Leslie's DVDs and this one is among my most fav ones. The 3 mile walk is brisk and the belt is a great addition. I also have a couple of her interval training DVDs and they rock! She is an upbeat trainer and her moves are safe and easy - yet they burn tons of calories..so you dont waste time trying to learn the moves..instead you just start the exercise and have fun. I have gym membership but I prefer these DVDs over a gym anytime. Love her DVDs !!
5,Leslie Sansone Work out Dvd,"This was my first dvd of Leslie Sansone, it is a great workout. Very motivating, you can stop at one mile or go all the way to three. The workout band gives your arms something to do, and increases your heartrate for a good overall workout."
4,Another Great Leslie Sansone workout,"I really liked the workout with the belt. The belt adds a lot of intensity to the workout and the 45 minute workout is a real challenge. Didn't like the soundtrack too much, but other than that, it's pretty good.I also liked that you get to choose if you want to do 1, mile, 2 miles or 3 miles. Although you don't get to use the be;t much in the first mile. If you want to really use the belt then I suggest you do at least 2 miles.I love that the DVD is so easy to follow even for someone like me who has 2 left feet. There are no complicated maneuvers but enough variation to keep things interesting."
4,Surprisingly effective,"Well I have been trying Leslie's workouts and after 2 knee injuries this was all I could do. I used to be a very active energetic person until this setback. So slowly building up with her various miles helped me to do a 5k. Now this one with the band had me pretty skeptical. I use free weights up to 5 lbs so I thought this would be nothing. Well the tension was enough on the bands to give a workout you can feel! If you concentrate on tucking your abs you will feel them after the workout as well. The only thing I would say negatively about this workout is Leslie gets too chatty with one of the background walkers at the end of the 3rd mile and not only could I not understand what they were saying, it was rather annoying trying to catch what she was saying.Oh well other than that I highly recommend this one!"
5,Very Timely,"My purchase of this product was excellent. The service was fast, accurate and in excellent condition."
3,"Good, not great","I have several Leslie Sanesone walking workouts, and this one is better than some but not great. The belt and bands were too loose for me, so after a few times I finally tied a knot in the band and it helped. But really I don't feel like she uses the bands enough. She has you tuck the handles into the belt, which makes it uncomfortable to do knee lifts. Then when you pull the bands out again, the belt is loose.It is a good workout, I do get winded and sweaty, but I don't feel like it uses the bands enough to tone my arms. :-/"
5,Wonderful,This was my first tape by Leslie and it wont be my last I'm buying a couple for Christmas gifts. I Love It.
4,Fun low impact cardio,"I like Leslie Sansone's DVD. She make low impact cardio fun. I was recovering from a back injury when a friend introduced me to this. It's great if you are a little older have an injury or are new to exercise. If you are a P90 X person you have no need for this. It will burn a few calories and make you feel great but I yet to ""walk away my waistline"". We do this DVD as a group at work and I really enjoy it. While everyone else is hitting the vending machine and getting more coffee my exercise group does this instead. We feel a lot better for it.My only complaint and the reason I took away a star is the way she shamelessly plugs ""the belt"" that comes with the DVD. While it is fun to use I don't think it adds anything to the work out that an ordinary pair of hand weight wouldn't do. Don't worry if you don't have ""the belt"" it's a silly contraption. Just grab a couple of weights and you will get an even better workout."
4,An indoor walking workout,"I was looking for a DVD to break the monotony of a treadmill workout. This is not it. The walking pace is too slow for a treadmill. However, once I got off the treadmill and continued the moves, I did break out in a sweat. This is a good workout for a beginner. The moves are uncomplicated. Leslie doesn't use the waist band enough though the video but you could easily continue the arm exercises on your own throughout the video for a tougher workout."
5,Good workout,"This is the first Leslie Sansone DVD that I have used and I bought it because of other customers favorable reviews. I started walking in the evenings to help my restless legs and this has really helped. It took me almost a week to be able to do the 3 miles but now it feels so good. I don't really notice a difference wearing the walk belt. There's a nice warm up and cool down which is great. I would recommend this to any walker, even those new to Leslie. I love how she is so upbeat and encouraging. I'm hooked and have to walk every night."
2,Not the best karate...,"The foundations of Traditional Karate make no more sense (at least in the modern civilization). Principles and methods must be rationalized. Sensei Kenji Tokitsu, a living ledgend in Japan and France, is carrying a supberb work towards Quality. The best Karate indeed."
4,A great series to start your personal library with,"I recommend Nakayama sensei's Best Karate series as a must have for any personal library. Individually, each book is not the be all-end all of karate knowledge, but taken as a set, it offers a wide range of information and motivation for the beginning karateka. Plus...its a classic with the little men jumping and kicking all over the pages!"
4,gut Bücher mit mangelhaftem Inhalt,"Die Bücher von Nakayama sind wirklich gute Lehrbücher. Und das sage ich, obwohl ich den Mann nicht ausstehen kann. Sei Karate war schlecht und hatte mit dem eigentlichen Uchinadi, mit der Lehre Funakoshis, nicht viel zu tun.Die Werke sind jedoch gründlich aufgearbeitet und von einer guten Qualität. So fair will ich sein. Wer jedoch eine fehlerhafte Kunst unterrichtet, kann sie noch so schön verpacken. Die Fehler werden bleiben."
5,Get character even in a spec home,"This book is very specific in how to add character, why it works, and specifics on using each detail. Finding older homes in our area is difficult in our price range, but we'll definitely be able to add those delightful touches in a new spec house. Great book."
3,How old is this product?,"We love shrinky dinks but were disappointed in this package because the images look so dated... like they were designed in the 70's when the product came out! Like the blank sheets though, we had fun designing our own."
2,bhg,The problem isn't so much with the cookbook as the seller and publication listing. It IS NOT the BHG cookbook; it is in fact excerpts from. The actual cookbook is over 800 pages and this was only selected recipes and 200 pages. The seller either didn't know or listed it as something it wasn't.
3,Very detailed,"This book is very detailed in its description of the life of the Booths. The details can get challenging to wade through. If you like one given to details, you will love it."
5,A continuing saga that is Loudon,"This guy's brilliant. Some people think he's a very bitter dude, but these are the folks that just don't get this guy. He sings songs that represent all of us; it isn't always about just him. He's never been afraid to let us know how he feels, and it's made for some interesting listening over the years; this one's no exception. And yes, Loudon's sense of humour is as sharp as ever. This disc showcases a fuller sound than his last couple, and I think it works very nicely here. We need more raw musicians like this today. People with guts that put it out on the line for us to hear."
4,still great,"I like this album, and I love a couple of the songs. I think No Sure Way is eery, engaging, moving, and a brilliant 9/11 tribute or recollection. It comes from personal experience -- he was there and wrote it shortly afterward. The other great song is Here Come The Choppers, which is funny, intense and a good commentary on Southern California's helicopter culture. Ironic drama that's part apocalypse, part snide travelogue of Meaty Meatburger territory where you never know who's hiding from the choppers in your backyard garbage cans.The other songs are all good enough to mostly keep you from skipping to Choppers, and I like anything about Hank Williams, especially when it comes from an Alabama road trip with Steve Buscemi."
3,Here's hoping the well hasn't run dry,"Although disappointing, even a weak effort by LW III is worth a listen. In ""My Biggest Fan"" we find Loudo flattering himself with the assumption that long time fans would want to know on a more personal level the maladjusted egotistical spoiled rich kid painted in musical self-portrait so brilliantly over the years. And yes, we all get the comparisons with Dylan et al. so perhaps these tiresome jokes can be retired soon? ""No Sure Way"" offers nothing insightful, interesting, or moving about 9-11 but at least it's the pleasant sort of nothing you can hum along with. ""Make Your Mother Mad"" is equal parts funny and creepy, ""Half Fist"" and ""Nanny"" drag yet more of those wild and crazy Wainwright relatives out for a brief turn around the stage, and ""Things"" includes a verse that begins ""This song's almost over."" Ouch."
4,A little dull... but perfect fit for my Dremel.,"I wanted to do some detail routing of some shelf brackets and figured my Dremel would do the trick using the cutting base. The bit set fit my Dremel perfectly though, to be honest, they were a little dull and had a tendency to scorch the wood. I also had to mortise some hinges on my cabinet doors, and this is where the Dremel/router bit combo shined. For shallow mortises it worked like a charm and made the job painless. I would clamp a piece of wood on either side of the cabinet face frame and use that as a guide for the Dremel (also using the cutting base). I dont think I would have achieved the same consistent results using a chisel. All in all, very satisfied with this purchase."
5,All That for 10 Bucks,"Recently I knocked my mid-size Pyrex mixing bowl into the sink with the bad luck that it landed on the reinforced ring holding up the Dispose-All and broke. Checking around I found that a replacement could run as high as $20.00. Admittedly some have an egg shape (?) and a rubber non-slip ring around the bottom, but I still have the two hands I was born with so I was delighted to find this set of three on-line at Amazon+Target for about $10.00. As usual, the order arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Thanks Amazon.com!"
3,Performance not Instruction,"I got this video in the hopes that it would provide for me some instruction into at least one of the dances from one of the time periods. Instead it is a dance troupe performing dances from the different times. Due to costuming and lack of zoom in camera work you are unable to see the women's footwork. If you are interested in only seeing the dances this video will suit well your purpose, but if your desire is to be able to dance to the music that you enjoy of these time periods, in the proper manner... forget it. If I had known it was performance would not have bought it. Now I will gift it to someone that can appreciate it. I can not."
3,Moschino is my favorite,"Moschino is my all time favorite scent and I got tons of compliments on it. Still get compliments on this bottle purchased, but didn't have the same scent as in the past. Weaker, or not quite the same. Not sure why it wouldn't be."
1,Not what it seems,"I bought this product because it was described as having ""an aluminum handle"". The handle is in fact PLASTIC in an aluminum color. The entire unit is plastic and is of poorer quality than the original manufacturer's handles that it is made to replace. It is not worth $1.95 let alone $19.95. What a ripoff."
1,This is Garbage,It claims it has an aluminum handle. Its plastic and the head broke off after 4 months of use. Steer clear of this product. I want my money back.
5,Moving,I must say that this was a great book. I read it in one day. I felt so bad for Neecey and found myself crying for her and her siblings. It seemed every corner she turned she was being abused or hurt. Her mother needed some serious help and the grandmother had me so pissed off! How could a person treat children that way? I'm hoping there is a second part that mixes the mother's past with Neecey's future.
5,Good Job Cris Burks!,"I can't believe there are such few comments! This was a GREAT read! Neecey's Lullaby was a raw,emotional and entertaining read. Once I started I had to finish just to know how things would end up for her and her family.The character's in this novel are easy to relate to-I reccomend this book to any and everyone...Enjoy!"
4,Heartwrenching,"Although I found some of the paragraphs a little choppy, this was an intriguing story that left me wanting more. As another reviewer said, I would love for the author to go back to the mother's life before Chicago (where this story took place), because that would probably make for a good story as well. Great book to read if you want something that you can finish over a weekend or short vacation!"
1,Portal Design in radiation therapy,"untill now I didn't got it , how can review.I would like cancel it order, please refun me."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed with this product. I was not able to find filmpacks to use with it. I have never used it. The product came with no instructions. I had to go online to the company website to download a user guide. It was however reasonably priced and arrived promptly.
5,Possibly the best Ravenloft expansion ever...,"Out of all of the 2nd Edition Ravenloft expansions, this was possibly the best. While the chance to explore the Nightmare Lands (quite possibly one of the most interesting domains in Ravenloft) was cool enough, this expansion also sets up in-depth core rules for running ""dream"" adventures, which can be adapted for any type of campaign. The only drawback is that it hasn't yet been adapted to the newer 3.5 rules, but any DM should be able to work around that."
4,"NICHOLAS RAY, OPUS 7","**** 1952. ON DANGEROUS GROUND was based on Gerald Butler'sMad with much heartand directed by Nicholas Ray. A lonesome and violent policeman is told by his hierarchy to get out of the city in order to help a colleague in the country. There, he will meet someone even more solitary than him, a young blind woman whose brother is a murderer. Detective Jim Wilson is DixonIn a Lonely PlaceSteele's brother, he's a violent man by nature. Note also the mirror theme that will reappear in the following Nicholas Ray movies. Highly recommended."
5,Winning One Pocket,"This is an excellent book on how that most esoteric and frustrating of pocket billiard games should be played.The diagrams are very helpful and the discussion of the theory behind each of the possible shots really helps make a difficult game more approachable.For this edition the authors also made an effort to capture a lot of stories about ""best"" one-pocket shots across the years.Having this book and working through just the beginning points has already added 2 balls to my game.The only problem? It is not available. I actually ahd to go to e-bay and pay more than 2x the original price for it. But it was worth it!"
4,DSP-300 Goog or Bad???,"The headset works vary good in voice chats. The mic works grate. The sound you get from the headset is vary good. The inline volume control stoped working after one week but it looks, sounds, and feels grate...... It is a good BUY! I GAVE 4 STARS!"
3,"Some Great Ideas, But.....","This book has some wonderful ideas for memory makers, door prize and game ideas, however, the majority of this book is tear out game sheets. Out of about 112 pages, 102 are tear out! (4 games repeated for 12 guests) That doesn't mean this book should be totally overlooked, it has a few great ideas to offer, but it was disappointing to see so many tear outs! Just be forewarned what to expect"
4,So thats what I do...,For years I have tried to do things in XP that other people have told me how to do without much luck. This book makes it simple.
3,Easy to Understand,"This book was as it says, ""Plain & Simple,"" but it did not cover the intricacies of XP that I was looking for. I upgraded to Windows XP ""Step by Step"" which includes a CD training program."
2,You get what you pay for,"4 horror movies for $10? You know what you get when you buy a bargain. Nudity [tops only], simulated sex, poor acting and amateurish fight scenes. Not at all frightening for a horror movie, but mildly entertaining. Just don't expect too much."
2,bad acting but sexy,"if you wanted to see a movie that you know is stuped but still erotic, you found it and comparing to other prices this is a pritty good deal ."
5,A Wonderful Teen Summer Love Story,"Annie-Laura Smith conveys the trials ands tribulations of a summer of sailing, beach combing and young love with a delightful flare. Cassie Andrews spends a summer with an Aunt and Uncle in the Florida sun trying to forget an unfortunate and humiliating high school love affair. But Jason, a young man about to enter the Air Force Academe makes her reconsider her vow of no more boys. Through thrilling sailing adventures and beach romps they become closer but Cassie wonders, does he only want her for her mind. Annie-Laura Smith provides an interesting twist that forms the basis for a wonderful story. I would recommend it for girls 12 and up and those who enjoy sailing.Jamie Dodson, Author[...]"
3,Good Game,"Now this game came out in 1994, and was the debut of a simulation series called ""Jane's Combat Simulations,"" published by Electronic Arts, and this particular game was a very great game, but not as detailed for flight simulations. ATF, another early game by Jane's Combat Simulations, was just like this, but with many more planes. This game let you fly many of the fighter jets in the US Navy, like the F-14 Tomcat, and the FA-18 Hornet, along with many more planes. USNF '97 was a windows version of this game, with a Vietnam campaign. Why i rated this 3 stars is because of a lack in a full cockpit, and lack of avionics control, and after playing ATF a lot, ATF was just the same thing, just not a Navy style. The game was like Novalogic's games, better graphics, less realism, but still fun."
3,?? What movies are included?,There's no listing here of anything on the DVD. What films are on the DVD?
5,Outstanding!,"I read this book during the Summer of 1999, and I found it to be such an outrageously well-written book. There is enough humor and wit to balance the shocking (and anti-morality) tale about Carol Prince's life as ""the other woman."" This book was written in 1972, but I still found it timeless and entertaining in its message about the double standard against women. You must read this book! (I also highly recommend R.Jaffe's ""Mazes and Mosters."")"
4,Very good book,"This is a novel about a very independent, courageous woman's life, from the late 50's into the early 70's, and the choices she makes...Carol Prince is a determined to be strong and independent, and kick against the social customs of her times. (In other words, she's going to have a career and she's not going to get married.)It's a pleasure to read a book about a woman who has her mind made up, and refuses to be pushed around. When I first read the book I wanted the ending to be different. Now that I'm older, I'm glad the heroine made the decision she did. I think this is one of Ms. Jaffe's best."
2,Skip this book and watch the tv show,"The year is 2018 (which, in 1993, seemed so very far off) and we have begun to colonize the ocean floor. This has brought about a world of new territorial disputes and other problems, and thence comes the UEO, the United Earth/Oceans Organization, and its flagship - both militarily and scientifically - the seaQuest.I remember the tv show with a sort of amused fondness, which pretty well describes my feelings about this book. The writing is pretty good, which is not surprising given the authors, but they were constrained by the tv show's story and it shows. Original tie-in novels are better than novelizations of existing episodes; the book was not bad, but I'd recommend spending an hour watching the actual episode rather than several hours reading this.There was one line that made me laugh, that may or may not have been in the show: Bridger is searching seaQuest for something small (and hidden) and says to himself, ""I think I need a smaller boat..."""
3,Not as good as it could have been,"The book was well written, but it left out a lot of key points that I found neccessary to the story, as compared to the original script. Bridger and Stark were well portrayed, but the rest of the characters were shoved too far into the background."
3,"A book based on the series premiere of ""seaQuest DSV""","I enjoyed this book mostly because I'm a die-hard seaQuest fan. Normally, I really enjoy Diane Duane's work (she has written some very good Star Trek novels), but I was disapointed in the portrayal of the characters...the character's personalities in the book didn't always correspond to their personalities in the show."
4,Blade cuts into aluminum,"For harder wood, this thing is terrible. But if you are just cutting balsa or basswood, this will work fine. The blade does tend to cut into the side of the aluminum though. It also has a lip but no way to screw it down without drilling it. This means you will end up holding the box and the material down with one hand while cutting with the other. It gets awkward at some angles. The saw itself is great though. It even cleanly cuts carbon fiber."
5,does what it is supposed to,"The red handle of saw unscrews sometimes but just screw it back on.You only get 45 and 90 degree cuts. If you need different angles, you gotta choose a different one like I did."
5,Nice Handheld,Bought this to replace a very old Humminbird handheld. Like to leave a handheld with my wife when I am fishing in Canada and she stays back at the cabin. Bought the radio that uses 6 AA batteries. Purchased some good rechargable AA's and they last a very long time. When they go bad I can just buy new AA rechargables. Very happy with radio's performance.
4,Good Quality,Good quality product. Arrived on time as scheduled. Be aware there are different variations of these 'T Slot' products. Make sure you get the one you need for the type of bolt you want to use.
1,ROADS...by Larry McMurtry,McMurtry has been a favorite author of mine for some time. I purchased this book based on my past enjoyment of his writing.I (begrudgingly) read 150 pages of it before throwing it across the room. (Where it still lies)Now I know why it only cost me $0.01.......Save your penny!
3,Took some time to get it to work,"I bought this item thinking it would look just as it does in the picture, and it does, except they don't show you the 50' coax cord and 18"" antenna that hooks to it. I was disappointed that the best place I could get a signal was either having the antenna mounted to the front of my house or in the attic. I decided to keep it in the attic but I have yet to figure out how to run the cable down to my living room. I will say that I went from having 0-1 bars to 2-3 bars on my cell phone and I am now able to make and receive most calls. So yes, it does work, it is just not as easy to install as you would think."
2,Little to no improvement in signal despite multiple antenna locations,"We have AT&T; and live in a low spot. Reception is fine at the top of the driveway, but not so great in the house.I tried mounting the antenna inside the house, in the attic, and on the roof. the extender recognized our phones and showed that everything was working, but I saw no improvement in signal on either phone. Standing on the roof, i could get a good signal with my phone, but the antenna mounted in the same location didn't give me the same results inside.I really wanted this to work. It didn't for me. Seems like this product either works very well for you, or not at all."
5,Great!,"I live in an older apartment building on the second floor that doesn't get good service inside. I am using an iPhone with AT&T.; Normally, I would not get any service inside except right near the windows and even that was spotty. If I held my phone out the window I would get 3-5 bars of service.After installing the YX500-CEL, I now get 3-5 bars of service everywhere in my 800sq ft apartment. Unfortunately, I think AT&T; uses the 1900mhz band for 3G so I might upgrade to the YX510."
5,VZ Wireless finally useable in my house!,"I went from no signal in my (basement) office, to 5 bars just like that, with the antenna mounted inside my attic. Wireless Extenders' tech support was helpful, it turns out VZW is using 1900 MHz in my area so I did have to exchange the unit, but they were helpful and efficient and sent the new unit to me right away."
3,It works..but,"The wireless extender works if you are in close proximity to it. The 2500 square feet thing is optimistic but when I am in my office near the thing, I am no longer experiencing dropped calls."
3,eh it was alright,I'm actually trying to resell this item because it just isn't worth the hassle of setting up and getting it all to be right. I end up having to reset it more often then it helps my signal. Also I didn't even notice a different in my AT&T iPhone 3GS signal... I suppose this would a be great product if you had a phone it worked perfectly with.
1,More bars? yes. Better quality signal? no.,"After setting this up per the instructions, I now receive full bars anywhere inside my apartment. However, this does NOT translate to any better signal quality to my phone. I have AT&T service in Chicago, which is utilizing the ~ 850MHz range. I bought the 800MHz model."
1,Not worth the hassle . . .,I bought this because for some reason our house is a Verizon wireless dead zone. We mounted it in 4 different locations in the house & with the antenna inside and out and at every single location the base unit flashed and said that the signal was too strong. Too strong? We have never gotten more than 1-2 bars in our house.I boxed it up and am sending it back to Amazon. Decided to try the Verizon VOIP wireless extender instead because it looks to be no hassle compared to this unit.
1,Absolutely horrible,"Despite following the installation directions exactly, this $200 flimsy plastic box doesn't work. It doesn't send a usable signal unless you're huddled right next to it, crossing your fingers, and doing the chicken dance... and even then it doesn't work. Most of the time when I try to dial out, I get a network or connection error. If I manage to get through, my calls get dropped as soon as I say, ""Hello."" As much as I'd love to blame it on AT&T, I can't. Don't waste your money."
1,Don't waste your money if you have ATT,"The first one arrived broken, the second WOULD turn on, but did nothing for reception for my iPhone...So, too bad, I wasted my money. Don't make the same mistake."
3,Better Then it was,"I'll start off by saying I have better reception then I use to, but that reception is still hit or miss. My phone will ring anywhere in the house. but when I answer the phone, that's a different story. I called the company to give us some advice and it turns out that AT & T run on 2 different systems and they make a booster for that, but I didnt know that when I purchased this booster and the CSR told me it may not help to get the better booster. I think that I live to far in the sticks to expect reception better then what I have. And with Amazons policy of only refunding 80% of the purchase price, well I fell stuck with this booster or I would gotten the other one by now."
3,Not for cingular,"This product worked great for Verizon users, they recevied full signal through out our office. The same cannot be said for Cingular users (the majority of our users). It made no noticable improvement for cingular users and some have felt it may have reduced it, although I do not know how that could be. Probably should have gotten the dual band product for the extra money even though the Wireless Extenders home page said that it should work for Cingular."
3,z boost,I have decent siganl out side my house but my metal roof kills it inside .zboost works well to correct tha problem it boosted the signal in my house 3to 4 bars but you half to be in the same room as it or it drops.
1,it doens't work at all.,i can't believe they sell these and some company gave it an OK review. i have the perfect set up as it described and did exactly as instructed and it did NOTHING AT ALL. Complete waste of time and money
5,Satisfied Customer,Worked as advertised. Using an indoor antenna and still the reception is vastly improved. No dropped calls.
4,Zboost in the Keweenaw,It helps but I think I would do better with a different antenna and perhaps a different location for the receiver in my house. Where I live I am in some sort of hole where the signal seems to go in and out.
5,Great cell phone booster,"Like most rural dwellers, we did not have very good cell phone coverage inside our house. Having a metal roof probably did not help. Even if we could get one or two bars on the singal meter, once you started to move around the house, the singal would be dropped.I mounted the antenna behind the gable vent above the second floor in our house and ran the cable doen to a nearby mechancial closet. Once I plugged it in and got a signal we are in business.We know regularly have 4-5 bars of singal and can walk pretty much anywhere in the house and talk on our cell phones. This was a great investment."
2,Cell Phone Booster,Works well is you standing next to the unit. Get ten feet away and the signal drops significantly.
2,Nice Idea. Failed in Implementation,"Product works as described. However, what the buyer is not told is that you are required to have a huge antenna and run upwards of 20 feet of tv cable to get this thing to work. The antenna and the base unit cannot be close together therefore to get this product working must run cable through your house. I guess if you don't mind that then this is a good product. If you want cable running through your house then stay away. Amazon really needs to inform its customers of this fact."
2,Poor description!,Recently purchased this product and did not know that it has an external antenna that needs to be installed somewhere outside of the apartment/house. Since my apartment is small i didn't know that the device needed an additional 15 feet distance from antenna to device. I was disappointed to find that i was not informed of this when i purchased the item.
1,Broke Twice then warranty was out :(,"First one just stopped working one day so i sent it back, got a new one for free, after about 2 months the new one did the same thing, just stopped working one day. They wouldnt send me a third becasue the warranty was out.Also if you are trying to boost a place that has no service, like a basement, it might say you have 4 bars on your phone but it acts like it has one. Dont even try sending a picture. Texts still dont always go through. calls are only good if you are sitting next to the zBoost."
1,Didn't work for me,"This product was easy to set-up, but it didn't boost my phone signal (1-2 bars before, 1-2 bars with.) I tried it in 4 different locations on the roof, none really helped. To be fair, I did not have the directional antenna, maybe it would have worked. On the plus side, Amazon is great with returns."
2,Get a Network Extender instead!!,"I have a really really really flaky Verizon connection. I would drop calls all the time, even sometimes when standing in one of my special 'signal zones'. You know what I'm talking about. Anyway, I tried this thing out, and it would occasionally help my signal, but it just wasn't reliable. Maybe that's because my signal was so flaky to begin with. So I sent it back.And THEN I learned of the Verizon Wireless Network Extender. If you have Verizon and broadband internet, don't even think about this wireless booster. Just get the network extender. It's awesome, four solid bars throughout my whole house. If you have Sprint, they have a comparable product called the AIRAVE. Verizon's is $250 up front with no monthly fee. Sprint's is only $100 plus $5/month. Either way, I've heard you can sometimes talk them down if you threaten canceling your service. But even at full price, IT IS WORTH IT."
1,Did not work,"I have a seasonal property that has always had limited cell coverage. My LG phone had 1 bar, but the I-Phone showed no signal, or 1 bar until I tried to make a call. So I tried the z-Boost. The I-Phone did not provide a good signal indication, but my son's phone had a signal of 4 bars at one location on the porch roof. So he held the antenna there, and we started the z-Boost below the roof. The result was a resounding no signal on the I-Phone. Basically the z-Boost did not work."
1,Very Weak,"I live in the country with a weak cell signal. I mounted the external antenna very high (second floor porch) where the signal is usually one to two bars. The unit sits in our den which has open access to several rooms. When standing a foot from the unit, the signal strength is a solid four bars. Step a few feet away and it drops to two. Go in another room and it drops to one bar and sometimes zero. I have had calls dropped due to signal fade while in the next room. I would not buy this item again."
1,No improvement at all in my reception,"The best place in my house for reception is the third floor attic of my townhouse. I receive 1/2 bar at best on the ground floor where the line often goes dead, but 1.5 bars and consistent reception in the attic.So, I set this up in my attic as per the instuctions, and extended the line downstairs, but there absolutely was no improvement in my reception anywhere in the room. Tried several adjustments of location, but it still didn't work.They took it back as a return with no problem. I don't know if the one I received was defective, or if it just doesn't work in the conditions in my townhouse."
4,Good for RV applications also,"Mine is an RV application for Verizon Cell Phone, AT&T Cell Phone, and for Verizon Air Card; during our travels we are often in fringe reception areas. I compared it with a Wilson trucker antenna and amplifier at a single location in rural southeastern Maine; with my application I got 3 bars with Wilson, 4 bars with Wi-Ex. With the Wi-Ex 500 CEL we were able to get internet connection in about 95% of our locations. Very good. I then ordered the high gain booster antenna upgrade YX022-CEL (about $100) which increased internet download speed from 280 kbps to 1200 to 1800 kbps range -- 4 to 6 times as fast. Internet reliability is also very much improved with the YX022-CEL. I am very pleased with these products."
4,Good Review,I had no service or 1 bar in my home. I installed this item and now have service all over the house. My suggestion to you is read the directions. If it has to much signal it will shut down so it does not damage the equipment. 2 or 3 bars on your cell phone is plenty for the equipment to give you full service in the house. It is a great buy and only took me about 2 hourt to install.
4,Works better with add-ons,"This did not work great out of the box....with the antenna upstairs and the receiver downstairs. My Verizon single bar barely improved. But, after I purchased the stronger antenna and outdoor kit....mounted the antenna outside. My single bar....more than tripled to a full 5 bars. Now, I'm very happy....but at a price. It was not cheap."
1,Hunk a junk,I did what the instructions said...it works GREAT if you are in one room. but if you need it to go through the walls in a different room the signal drops fast. i.e. if you live in a studio get it. if you have multiple rooms it is a waste of money. highly Disappointed in it.
1,Didn't Live up to Expectations,"We installed this unit as instructed. Once in place, my phone showed 4 bars beside the transmitter. As soon as I tried to dial my phone, it quickly dropped to <1 bar, and the phone call was dropped each time.I did not have any luck with this item, and thankfully Amazon accepted the return with no problems."
4,Did the job for me,"I did some comparison shopping. Couldn't test other cell phone signal boosters, but this was in the right price range to do what I needed. Read complaints about it not working for people and other reviews stressing that it has to be installed correctly. Without this booster, my signal alternated between 0 and 2 bars, and that in only a few spots. With the booster it is 2 throughout the house and 3 or 4 bars closer to the booster.Could be better, but I'm satisfied."
3,Wireless extender,"This is probably a good product, but the originating cell signal must be strong enough in the first place for it to work properly. In more remote areas, a different manufacturer, such as Wilson, may have a more powerful product that would work better. I found this product to be extremely easy to set up and operate, but the signal from the cell tower was not strong enough for this product to repeat satisfactory. They do have a 20 day money back guarantee, so if you find out you need a more powerful model, you are not stuck and can return it for something different. The people at WiEx were good to deal with. I cannot fault their product as my problem is with the signal from my cell tower and I am trying to get the WiEx product to do something it really isn't designed with enough power to do. It's worth a try and just return it if it doesn't work."
1,Just does not work,"Purchased the booster due to a weak signal inside the house. I positioned the outdoor antenna on the peak of the roof where I get a good cell phone signal. Temporarily ran the cable into the house. Followed all of the set-up instructions and the base unit never detected the verizon cell phone.I called the technical hot line and they said they never had this problem before. Someone will call back in an hour. Two days later, the unit went back for a refund.If you want to try one, I advise a temporary installation. The scam is that if you run all of the cable and mount everything, you will not want to remove everything for return."
1,not worth it,works as described but you need to be 5 feet from the base. might be good for a desk but that is about it
1,Didn't like the Cell boost equipment,"I didn't find either the cell boost extender 500 or 510 to be effective and worth the money. I returned both wireless extenders (500 and 510)after both signal extenders would repeatedly drop calls. I was unable to set up the equipment where the signal was ""just right"" enough to keep a call. Initially, I would get addtional bars of service, but then in the middle of a call, the boost would flash ""too strong"" and drop my call. Customer service was unable to help, since I couldn't sustain a call long enough get advice when I was near the equipment. Overall, the cost of the equipment was not worth the trouble and was ineffective for increasing and sustaining my cellular service through a phone call."
3,May work somewhere but not here.,"I'd have to start by saying the customer service for the product is wonderful. They were able to clarify installation directions (base unit and exterior antannae have to be 15 VERTICAL FEET apart, not just 15 feet apart). Unfortunately we don't get a consistent enough signal to gauge if the product works. Once we got everything installed we had full signal but it would bounce around from Analog to Digital Roam to something else. Each time it would change (5-15 seconds), all signal would drop completely. Even when the signal held we couldn't receive or make calls. We are really disappointed. Our land line is ancient and not a day goes by when it works the whole day through. We were hoping this product would allow us to drop our land line and be completely cellular."
1,Dont Lie,If you dont sale this product with this caracteristics dont do it! Dont waste the time of others.
4,Mater to the Rescue!,"My daughter is in love with all things Cars and when her big mater got destroyed in the Washer I had to find her a new one. This Mater is a little smaller than I expected but I knew it would be smaller than her first one. It's perfect for her to carry around in the car or even at the store when she wants to bring her ""baby"". It has stood up to her rugged play without any tears or pieces coming off. As far as an educational value I put one star because it's a stuffed toy, it doesn't talk but I guess you could make it educational by ""talking through"" Mater."
3,so-so,"This is a nice plush, but definitely NOT what I expected for the money. Should be half the price, or much larger. Right now it would make a nice shelf item to look at, but not really play with."
2,"Sci Fi, not my cup of tea","I read this book because I love Lois McMaster Bujold and she mentioned this author in an interview. I found it interesting in its setting, but totally boring in its execution. too many improbable escapes....too many situations before the end. Others might find this more interesting than I....I just found it predicitable."
3,Incorrect classification,"This book was listed as new. It cost a little more than the others with bent spines, etc. When it arrived the pages were yellow and the spine was cracked. Still readable, but not as described."
4,czerneda is one of my favorite authors,"If you like sci-fi with great charachters, this is a book t oread. I loved it."
2,Just not worth it!,This desk has already made it to the Goodwill store. It was impossible to assemble without assistance and even after I got it together it was not very stable. I purchased this especially so that I could roll the cart from one room to another. NOT!! I would never have trusted it for that purpose. The shelf shown above the terminal never did get attached because the pieces did not match up properly. I was willing to forgive that as I didn't really need the shelf but the rest was just a mess. I am not an inexperienced 'assembler' having put together many items of furniture from IKEA including a platform bed with four drawers but this desk totally defeated me.
2,wheels broke off after less than a year,"When moving the desk to clean under it, the left front wheel broke off. The only thing I had on the desk was my laptop. The way the wheel broke off, it is not repairable as the screw threads that held it in were only glued in at the factory. The desk is now on the floor, sans wheels. It was however, very inexpensive. So, if you buy it, don't ever move it."
1,Garbage,"The only thing this DVD proves is the author's ignorance of Catholicism. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage. It is full of inaccuracies and lies. The title alone contains a common misconception that non-Catholics have of Catholics, which only shows that this author twists facts to suit his own agenda. Catholics do not, and never have, ""worshipped"" Mary; they honor her as the mother of Jesus, just as they honor their own mothers."
1,Blasphemous,"I don't know what horrifies me more, that Amazon is willing to sell this drivel as if the man has a legitimate argument, or that he subtitled this ""Mother of Harlots"". To call the Virgin Mary a harlot is about as brutal a violation of everything that she was as you can get."
2,quick and trusty service,"Good service, but not entirely satisfactory, since did not specify whether the book contained chord boxes or note-to-note transcriptions."
1,Great High School Effort!!,"I just don't understand these other reviews. This record is terrible. Worst of all, it's boring. There's nothing here you wouldn't find at any local high school during a Battle of the Bands showdown. The vocals sound like Scott Weiland making love to John Popper, painfully. The playing is dull and uninventive. The songwriting much more of the same. Overall, you'd be better off using this disc as a coaster."
1,DON'T BE FOOLED BY FALSE ADVERTISING!!!,"I too got suckered by this DVD having the description, cast list, and DVD details for the film starring Sid Haig and Gloria Hendry. Even with all these reviews notifying them (which I didn't bother reading since the top of the page describes the film I want - and I know what it's about), and the merchandise returns, one would think Amazon might be bothered to do something about THEIR error..............seeing as how they just cost me the return postage to send this item back to them.FIX THIS PAGE!!!!!!!!!! >=(Most Sincerely,Susan L. ObergPublicist for Sid Haig(and not the only one disappointed...)"
1,An awful movie,"I watched this movie and it's crapy,crapy and you will never get the 1 hour and 25 mins.back from your life so please don't buy it if anything rent it like I did and save money and for me its not good at all...."
3,Good story but too many inconsistancies,"In Celeste (to anyone who paid attention) Celeste/Noble was 16 when she had Baby Celeste. It was brought up that she was 1 year younger than Elliot who was already driving and she was old enough to driver herself (Sarah was going to get her a car that proves this fact). At the end of Black Cat, they try to sell her off as 11 at the time of the birth. Sorry, no dice.That is not the only inconsistancy in the series (there's also a question as whether she ever had the chicken pox), but definetly the most unforgivable. I can't get past it. It clouds my judgement of the rest of the book.I will read Child of Darkness because I have to know if that was done on purpose, but I'm dreading it."
3,A Little Predictable But A Good Story Continuence,"When I started reading the Gemini series I was plesently suprised by the darkness in tone. It was a return to form for the author. But as usual the second book falls a little bit short. After Celeste gave birth to Baby Celeste her mother made her go back to being Noble. In this book, things pick up where they left off. Celeste is still Noble and her mother is still wacky. The story continues as Sarah marries the next door neighbor (who is the grandfather of Baby Celeste). This leads to an eventual confrontation with his daughter Betsy. The book concludes kind of abruptly and doesn't leave a great ending."
4,Better than the first book,"I was not too thrilled with the first book in this series, i did, however...like this one much better. Baby Celeste turns into a ""mini-Sarah"" and Betsy appears to make everyone's lives a living hell. I can't wait to read the next book, which i think will tell baby Celeste's story."
5,:),My girlfriend loves VC Andrews :) she was so excited about the condition of this book.. Worth the money :)
2,Not what I expected,"The designs are very nice, but they don't stick very well on anything! Even on regular paper, they are very easy to peel off. So, they don't work as permanent labels, but could be used as removable/re-stickable/reusable labels.I think that they are designed to be gift tags. They would not, however, be good mailing labels."
1,Society 8th Edition,"I was not happy with my product, to say the least! I bought this book for a college class I am taking. The book I purchased had said it was in good condition, it was used. It's not that the book is torn or in bad shape..BUT it is MISSING 3 ENTIRE CHAPTERS. The book is like a binder so the pages can be removed. I am missing chapters 6,8 and 10 I think amazon.com should send me my money back or send me a new book.--kori"
4,A Pig Tale - Save the Earth,"A Pig Tale is a very catchy poem about a little pig named Ziggy and his dad, Pop Iggy. Ziggy gets made fun of by everyone because his dad collects junk. Then one day, his dad announces that he will make something spectacular with all of his junk and everyone waits to see what it will be. When the barn doors open, everyone sees his ""amazing invention, a most beautiful thing!"" It's a beautiful balloon! Ziggy and his father circle the globe in their balloon and Ziggy is very proud of his father. The story has a wonderful morale: ""Protect our dear earth. Don't throw it away. You, too, could make magic from garbage someday. This is an excellent book to have around during the study of Earth Day, especially for younger children."
4,Reggae,"I am anti-reggae, not for any other reason than, I do not enjoy mainstream popular music. I findmyself prone to listening to quality music as opposed to quantity music. Therefore, record labelswould not find me to be in their best interests.I found Third World to be surprisingly enjoyable. The overall sound isboth rhythmic and yet soulful. I am by nature a fan of opera, specifically Italian performers.I have travelled all around the world and listened to a diversified class of music, from Greek toAmerican Pop, all of which can be enjoyable. However, Reggae has never interested me other thanUB40, and that is mainly because I am English.Very enjoyable and well-suited to long drives if you'd like something to keep you awake.My hat's off to this group, I can truthfully claim real enjoyment for tasteful music which is bothmusically enjoyable and clean."
1,Not what I was expecting.,The HP Premium Photo Paper used to be like a post card quality but now it is thin and not even like a photo. I imagine it's because the paper is probably made in China now. I will continue to look for the old quality.
2,Don't use with canon,I have a canon mx700 and this photo paper is horrible with this printer. I have lines thru out the pictures. I recently purchase the new ink bundle from canon and it comes the photo glossy ii paper. And the quality is night and day. Just giving non Hp user a heads up.
5,Great paper!!!,It is soooo nice to be able to print quality photos in my living room. The paper is very reasonably priced and the final product is actually better than the corner drugstore. I will continue to buy this paper and suggest you all do the same.
3,Odd paper...may be good for HP...but...,"I didn't use this paper on an HP printer, but I recommend against getting it for any other printer (at least). As another person mentioned, it takes very long to dry, and gives worse image quality than cheaper papers. Black ink doesn't seem to absorb as much as colors, so you get odd reflectivity changes around black edges.I expected better."
4,"Short read , but loved it...","I totally love romance books, but throw Christmas in there to and im a very happy women. Every women should have a fantasy or two especially on her Christmas list...."
3,Cute but predictable?,Pretty okay for a quick read. Seemed not to know what to do with the story at one point and then a sudden short ending after dragging heals.
4,Good Book.,It's a good book and a nice quick read. I enjoyed it and even suggested it to a co-worker and they ejoyed it too.
2,Not up to real Cisco product quality,"Cisco is putting their name on these devices, but they're a far cry from real Cisco gear. I've been a networking professional for almost 20 years. Cisco beats Netgear, HP, D-Link, and the rest, hands down when it comes to enterprise level networking equipment. Linksys was bought by Cisco, but so far I haven't seen any indication that Cisco's quality is seeping into the Linksys product line.I'm trying to rid my network, and my users' homes, of these small Linksys switches. In my experience, they are a constant source of problems."
5,Set it and forget it,"I got this for an office at work. I had to upgrade it from slowwww 10-base-T to Fast Ethernet. As soon I plugged it up, DHCP took care of the rest. This hub takes a pounding between Internet, printer, and servers daily. No problem for it. Some of our network connections are true Gigabit speed, and this switch holds it's own against this equipment."
5,Small footprint and does its job well,"I ran out of places to plug in all of my computer devices on my wired/wireless router and this little device gave me the added ports that I needed. At first I had it located right beside the router, but later I needed to pair up a specific computer that had a UPS battery backup with a VOIP phone adapter and used this little switch to share the data running on that cable (from the router to the computer) between the DVR computer and themagicJack PlusVOIP phone line. This device is so small that it is hardly noticable among all the other cables and devices there in the cabinet that houses it all. What else is there to say, it does its job seemlessly 24/7/365 without fail."
4,Simple and Reliable,"I've owned one of these for about two years and it's been used continuously for months at a time. This switch has given me no issues. I note that it's plugged into a UPS (uninterruptible power supply), so it's been shielded from outages and power fluctuations.PROS:Ports that are on the BACK (attractive look if you plan to use it on a desk or shelf).The small A/C adaptor plugs into the back of my UPS without covering other outlets.Attractive design and colors..Status lights are noticeable but not distracting..CONS:I'm detracting one star because it gets warm unlike my older Netgear switch, so I suspect that it consumes more energy.I recommend this as it has performed well, but I might also go with the Trendnet Green series with the intent of consuming less energy (it's only a couple watts but it makes a big difference since these tend to be be used continuously)."
2,Not That Great,"This is only marginally better than using the computer microphone that probably came with your computer. I found that it really doesn't pick up sound well, seeing as the microphone hangs at around mid-cheek. A [price] stereo set I got at Radio Shack with a mike that comes all the way out to my MOUTH works a lot better. Don't waste your money."
2,too much trouble,At first I was pleased with this headset. The sound quality was better than my previous one and it had the advantage of two options for fitting it to your ear. But it gave me problems from the start. The 2 gel adaptors provided are easily lost and it was not comfortable to wear. The mic silencer would often get turned on unintentionally. Finally it just stopped working entirely. I'd like to get my money back for a flawed product.
4,Sit back and enjoy,"This is not a guitar hero album. You wont find here the reason why he was compared to Clapton in the 60's. After listening to a couple of tracks, you get the feeling that Peter Green doesnt worries about that at all. You hear a man having a good time, listening to the healing words of Robert Johnson. Deep words from a deep voice. The overall feeling of the album is great; it's loose but it's not improvised. Of course I wish Peter would have played a little bit more, but after all, thats one of the main reasons I like his playing so much; he never wastes a word."
4,A Few Helpful Tips,"Although there are a few good tips on how to save money, such as how to save on taxes, most of the information contained in this book is common sense. This book will show you how to get the most bang for your buck but, as you would expect, the only way to get that buck is from parents, loans and scholarships."
3,A mixture of very good and not-so-much,"After discovering that some of the best Native American flute (NAF) players are almost unknown, I've been searching for artists like John De Boer. This collection is downloadable, meaning you can sort through its inconsistencies. De Boer has imagination, talent and sensitivity. The good songs reveal that. They will linger in your memory for a long time. The bad songs are either overloaded with special effects or feature the musician showing off his technique. I can't explain why De Boer's good judgment goes missing on some of the tunes. But, I'll let you decide which songs I had in mind as deserving four stars. His best selections are well worth the small price, and they hold a unique place in this genre."
2,Definitively not for beginners,"I know pretty well how to ride a horse. I can ride any horse in any saddle and make it go at the exactly the pace I want. I can even do a little of fancy stuff all the way to making the horse lie in the ground and get back up without dismounting. I also know that to a dressage expert, a ten-year-experience-rider ""does not know the first thing about riding a horse"". This might not be a bad book; it might even be a great one. But for somebody hoping for an introduction to dressage it is a disaster. You look at a picture as it explains the x, y and z attributes of horse and rider while x, y and z remain a mystery to you. Do not buy this book if you do not have ample experience in dressage. It will be like reading a book written in Chinese."
1,Not really jazz,"This is BAD - 4 R&B type tunes and 2 sleepwalking ballads No wonder mosaic/trueblue has disavowed Freddie in retrospect. His only typical Blue Note is DOWN TO EARTH with Percy France and Kenny Burrell,a Home Cookin' kind of groove without Jimmy. Joe Henderson can be heard to much better advantage on Pete LaRoca's BASRA quartet session with Steve Kuhn on piano."
1,Ouch! This movie's bad!,"I purchased this movie just to see how campy it would be and it was terrible. I can't believe that William Beaudine (Producer) actually thought that this flick would sell? Anyway, I thought it would be fun but, it was one big waste of time...Two thumbs down. Purchase it only if you must but, I wanted it for my collection."
4,Letters from Afghanistan,"In this book the author talks about life in Afghanistan before the Taliban.The author and her husband join the Peace Corps.and are send to Afghanistan, although people were very poor ,the generosity they confronted was unbelievable. Intresting reading . Michael Tsapazis author of ""Zion and the Magic Sword"""
5,Wonderfully useful and wonderfully funny!,"I have to admit that I am a woman. I bought this book for my husband for Father's Day. He read it. Then I read it. Now he has bought five more copies for his friends, and I have bought six for friends of mine, and the golf club we belong to now buys copies to give away for prizes! I just loved this book. I sat down and thumbed through it thinking ""This won't be for me"" and the next thing I knew I was reading it from cover to cover. Everything is in here! I loved ""how to eat beer three meals a day"" and all of the gardening things. My husband likes the men's fashion material and the entries on women (of course!). But all of it is very practical. And the writing is just the best."
1,"I'd write more, but I got bored after the eighth page","I have purchased a number of the men's guides, and found this the least useful. This book is rather verbose, without really saying anything. The author spends several pages instructing users to ignore instruction manuals (except for this book, which he admits is a manual on life). I suggest you take his advice, and skip this instruction manual as well.Then again, I was filled with ennui and put down the book after the first chapter, it's possible that it improves, but by scanning through it, I somehow doubt it."
2,Super Reader,"A renegade scientist invents a drug to bring out man's bestial instincts, turning them into killing machines.An associate of Cap's kills his family and then himself under the influence of this.A young telepath who has information has been imprisoned and is due to be the subject of one of those hunt to the death games unless Kennedy gets there first. Cap needs this information to find the evil scientist and give him the energy weapon sayonara.Having tracked the scientist down, and upon infiltration of his base, it takes all his abilities and the 'Ghergach System of Disorientation' for him to resist the drug and not go to beast man himself."
5,Excellent book,Heaven in your Heart teaches you how to connect to the power of God and make it work in everyday life. Ed Montgomery is an excellent author!
5,After Image,"Movie arrived in perfect condition, and I have yet to view it. But am quite sure it is a good movie. I love John Mellencamp, and his music and own another of his movies and loved that one too. Knowing how particular he is about his work, it will be awesome!"
1,Most boring movie I have ever seen!,How could anyone give this movie a 5 star rating? Eight people watched this film with me and everyone strongly disliked it. H.G
1,Tried to save money,"How hard could it be to design a hold down. I use t track hold downs for home cnc so when a workpiece slips while I'm routing, it causes alot of grief. These hold downs will allow slippage.Heres the problem:1 cheap plastic knobs, simply encase a nut that fits the bolt. the knob will strip.2 holddown is metal, which is strong enough- but again with vibration it will slip while holding down a piece of wood. Better would be to have a rubber coating on the metal tip.3 there is a slim washer between the knob and the holddown-- doesn't prevent the hold down from slipping when tightened on a workpiece.4 bolt- eh. (also it is an odd size with a finer thread that will not fit other better made knobs)So, these ended up in my box of other cheap solutions that did not work out.Bought the woodpeck holddowns, much better thought out, not much more expensive. [...]"
1,JUNK,This is such a waste of good aluminium. Why put a cheep hex head bolt instead of a regular T bolt? Go to Rockler.con and spend 2 bucks more and get good ones they come with 5/16 T slot bolts and 5 star knob.
2,Pieces missing,"Although the hold down clamp appears to be well made and the outside packaging was good, one of the individual packages inside the box was cut and/or torn and the plastic knob and flat washer were missing. This makes one of the hold down clamps unusable until I can find a replacement or given the thread on the bolt appears to be Metric I will most likely have to replace the bolt, washer and knob--not a really big deal but it is irritating and not what I have come to expect from Amazon. dj"
2,Haggard at his worst,"Haggard started out at his best with She and King Solomon's Mines, then he gradually started repeating himself and ended up with stuff like this book, which reads like a parody of Haggard."
2,"Hardware installs fine with XP, software fails.","The device installs fine with windows XP (SP1). I can use the microphone, and it's OK.However the software fails to install.Plantronics support is not very helpful - claiming that my USB chipset is at fault (some install shield problem). They suggested searching the web for some answers!It's unclear what value the softwar adds - and again Plantronics are not fortcoming with information there either."
5,"USB that's cheep, and clear","I just pluged it into my Mac, and it worked. i love mac, sometimes. :)the sound is far better then other headset mics, I've tried.I use it to recoed voices, for Animation. You can even whisper, and itsounds clear.A very good choice for Mac.I use it only for recording voices. i have a different set I use for gaming.One that will not fall off. I bought this for recording voices. That is whyi don't care if it only has one Headphone.My review is for the Mic only.i love it."
1,Don't get as a PS2 SOCOM headset replacement,"Somebody had recommended this as a replacement for PS2's SOCOM US Navy Seals headset, but forget it. This won't work with SOCOM."
3,Slight Charm,"Odile lacks Queneau's usual almost manic inventiveness, but it is charming and gentle, and seems largely autobiographical, so it's nice to be given some insights into Queneau's early life, his formative years as it were.But one of my main gripes with the book is that it is overloaded with thinly veiled portraits of actual people, most of whom are scarcely developed. Unless you're thoroughly versed in the milieu of artsy 20's Paris, there's little chance you can satisfactorily follow what's going on. I suspect this book was intended more to be read by Queneau's contemporaries, as a jab at what and who he considered pretentious or downright foolish."
5,Quite a ride...hardboiled fiction with a psychological twist,"Hey, we all need some guilty pleasures, and I found this great piece of hardboiled fiction pretty tough to put down. Wise cracking celebrity detective Johnny Lane can outslug any adversary and sweet talk any woman, but when a dark past collides with an even darker future, we join his harrowing descent into madness. Dave Zeltserman treats this story with enough verve and dark humor (Lane's manic impulses include one of the greatest appetites for food I have ever read) that you find yourself carried along for the ride despite your best intentions. I particularly enjoyed his knack for capturing all the little details surrounding this seedy cast of characters and the spasms of violence that engulfs them all. ""In His Shadow"" has the mesmerizing quality of a bad car wreck. You don't want to watch, but you catch yourself counting all the body parts anyway."
2,Not much hellp,"It is very hard to believe that I paid $5.95 for an article that says, ""These books are useful"". I would be much more effective to buy one of the sigh reading and ear tests and see what the music teacher can do with it."
5,A True Folk Gem,"I came upon this in revisiting my CD collection and quickly brought it back out to the top of the pile. After a weekend of NEFFA (New England Folk Festival) hear in the East it was a welcome continuance of the folk spirit from that great event. This CD deserves to be in everyones folk collection. It is broad ranging in appeal and subject matter. The vocal is great, but a little more banjo on a banjo title would have been welcome. I particularly liked the Barb'ra Allen treatment."
5,great toy for younger children too!,"I have a 20 month child who is very excited to recognize the alphabet, colors, shapes, and numbers. With adult supervision, she is able to play with this LeapPad appropriately. To the parent complaining that an excited 3-year-old shouldn't be expected to know not to carry the pad by the pen??? I say that when supervised and shown that certain toys warrant proper care, any age child can play with a LeapPad appropriately. We love this toy and are looking forward to puchasing other books as our child grows older!"
3,My first leap pad,"I also am a homeschooling parent and think this toy has been great ! I am embarrassed by the ""Homeschool Mama"" who made a comment regarding the other reviewer. Don't be so quick to judge."
4,Good suggestions for overhauling one's work & life goals,Chapter Four of this book gives particularly meaningful ways to create positive change in one's outlook and attitude towards one's work life. This chapter has helped me step back and see the larger issues which truly affect the day to day detail of the workplace. One reading of this book is not enough as each chapter is packed with so many ideas and detailed suggestions for improving one workplace environment. I need to reread this book several times to take it all in. I plan to keep this book handy as a reference and motivator to put as many of the suggestions into practice as possible. Improving the quality of one's work-life and consequently home-life is a goal that I believe this book can help with.
1,its a good amp,"i'v used this amp with my Dual 12"" subs for a coupple months. although i dont like the subs the amp pushes the 1100 watt subs great, and it dosent drain my battery. this is a good way to go for a cheep hi watt amp"
4,Beautiful violin; Tricky strings,"This violin is well worth the money but I found myself slightly let down by the quality of the strings. Please, before you break your string(s), run your finger up and down the strings while pulling slightly. This prepares the strings from what I've been told by the man who ended up tuning mine, after I came back with a broken A sting.Other than this, great deal. I wouldn't pay full price, but half price is a steal."
3,Good but not great,"The beard trimmer part of this set I would actually give 4 stars. I have always liked the Norelco beard trimmers and this one is no exception. With 9 settings you can get pretty much any length you need.The other two items in the set i may give 2 stars to so they drag down the rating overall. The d-finer is like a torture device because it does not always cut the hair and will sometimes yank at it instead (owch). However, it does work at giving nice defined lines in your facial hair so that is nice. The nose hair trimmer is a ""run of the mill"" one and does an OK job. It does not trim very close at all so if you want a tight trime then this nose hair trimmer is not for you."
2,Not impressed,"I bought these to round out a 4-for-3 purchase, hoping the spoons would be nicer than the inexpensive ones I'd purchased at the grocery store. Unfortunately, they weren't. The material may be ""the finest beech wood,"" but it is rough and unfinished.For a person who has trouble with their grip, the cushiony handles may be helpful, but for me, they only took up extra room in my utensil jar. The spoon rest was equally unimpressive, resembling a product sample more than anything else.This set appears to be overpriced for its level of quality--I'm glad I got mine on sale."

4,Consistency Is Key,"The biggest takeaway from Montoya's book is the need for consistency.The fact is some experts lose track of the need for a steady hand on the wheel, thereby blurring their ""brand"" (ugh, that word is far too overused and meaningless; but that's a debate for another day). Whether they are authors, trainers, lecturers, or entrepreneurs (or a combination of each), all signs must point to a consistent image that the expert consciously tries to cultivate.Some of Montoya's techniques are a bit simplistic and oversold. It is important to remember that readers have the ability to take what works for them and discard the rest. If I get one or two ""wow"" ideas from a book these days, I consider it a worthwhile read. Montoya's emphasis on consistency was a pertinent ""wow"" reminder."
3,Good to start off but watch for proofreading errors!,"I'm just starting to study for the M&M portion of the exam and in just fifteen pages, I found three errors. They were relatively minor, and pretty obvious, but it makes me worry that i'm memorizing more major misprints or mistakes. If you do find a mistake, you can post it (please)on their website (the web address is on the inside cover of the book). It also helps to check the site to see what other mistakes were reported. You will need to consult other books for your studying, but this one is very manageable and good to start with."
1,Horrible,"Es un manual para abusar de tus hijos, fisica- y sexualmente. La cristianidad no apoya esto. Este hombre debe ser encarcelado."
4,Stanley's gig,"Thus is a wonderful, thoughtful movie. William Sanderson does a masterful job.The story is very moving. The uekele playing is also very, very good."
3,Deceiving Picture,"Don't be fooled by the image because I feel kind of tricked by it as when it arrived the beanie looked at least half the size that it shows. However, it does fit fair on my head although rather tight at the seams it could be looser. After this purchase though, I don't think I'd risk buying another one in a different colour as much as I'm tempted too because the beanie is not as big as I wished, or the way picture depicted."
4,review,"The product came to the wrong address. The actual product was fine, but it was sent to the wrong address. I don't know if this is a problem with Amazon or what, but it was frustrating."
5,A Wonderful Christmas Story!,"Years ago a friend read this book to me over a cup of tea during the Christmas season. I thought that was so sweet, I bought myself a copy. I have continued the tradition with many friends over the years. This year when I looked for my copy, I couldn't find it. So checked Amazon and found a replacement copy. In so doing, I found there is a sequel which I also ordered from the sweetest book seller, BONNIE TAGS. The day my copy of the original book, A CUP OF CHRISTMAS TEA arrived, my husband found my original copy! That's ok, next year I'll have a copy of this lovely book to give as a gift!"
5,"""A Cup of Christmas Tea""",This is a nice heart-warming Christmas story written as a poem. Good to read aloud at tea time during the holidays.
5,True meaning of Christmas conveyed with elegant simplicity!,"I've just received a copy of ""A Christmas Cup of Tea"" (on a chilly April day!) and have read it over six times. With each reading, this beautifully understated story of rediscovered joy in reaching out and connecting with others seems to reveal a little more insight. This is truly the ""Heart Sutra"" of Christmas theme books! An absolute must as a gift for anyone who has ever felt overwhelmed by the hubbub of the holiday rush!"
5,Heart warming and nastalgic,As I read Tom Hegg's book I was reminded how important little kindnesses are. Taking the time to visit and share is a lost art and we need to be reminded now and again of the importance of human touch. Wonderful and sensitive book. Blessings Tom!
3,Not as pictured,"The flaps are pictured as rectangular in shape. Unfortunately, when they arrived, they were tapered. They would probably work fine on a car (too small for a truck). I had planned to use them on a travel trailer and finally figured out a way the make them 'sort of' work. Being tapered, they do not provide the coverage I had hoped for. So don't beleve the picture. They are the tapered type you can find in Wal Mart."
1,Simply Disappointed,"This is the first book I have reviewed since purchasing books ...for over 4 years and I was so disappointed with this book, that I felt moved to warn others not to waste their time or money on this book. The plot in the beginning was interesting, but it quickly became boring and at the end very predictable. Yes, I knew the murderer long before I finished the book. I had the impression the author had read some of Judith Smith-Levin's books and decided I can do this also. I am sorry, but one has to get up rather early to stand a chance against Miss Smith-Levin."
3,Deadly Secrets,While Deadly Secrets was a smashing hit for my co-worker it did not prove to be the same for me !While I am a romance reader and lover of women fiction I do love a good mystery with some romance ! Maybe that's what was missing for me ! While I read the story I could not find motives for the series of murders ! I will say my co-worker was very enthusiastic about it ! I would say she rated it as a 5* ! Maybe if it had some romance and more relationship dealing with Jackie and Sam it would have been a much better read ! Just one person opinion !I have three other books by the author! Two romance and Damning Evidence so I will give him three more chances ! Especially with the two romance stories !
5,It's About Time!!!,"What a great detective novel with an African American female protagonist. This was an easy read with an enjoyable lead character! I truly enjoyed reading this book and was glad to read one with a good, strong, funny, female lead! I also highly recommend Murder in the Rose City by R. Barri Flowers!"
2,Not for the average kid,I have read several books on chess and think of myself as an average kids who plays at his elementary school Chess Club. The book is not easy to understand because it moves from one thing to another to quickly. It does not build on one idea to the next and asumes that you know a lot of stuff already. If you are very advanced then maybe this book is for you. Otherwsie forget it.
3,Interesting concept but a miss,The dialog concept used in the games is interesting. The problem is that often the book didn't answer the questions that I had about certain moves and positions in the games. The book is just ok in my opinion.
2,Hard to understand for a kid,"For my birthay I got a copy of this book, Art Of The Checkmate and Unbeatable Chess Lesson For Juniors. I liked Art Of The Checkmate, Unbeatable Chess Lessons was the very best and Best Lessons Of A Chess Coach was at the bottom.The problem is that this book is not as easy to understand for a kid like the others. I guess it would be ok for an adult."
1,Very hard to understand,I am a beginner at chess and have been looking for a chess coach. This book got my eye by the title. But I found this book to be very difficult to understand and confusing. This book is too hard for a fifth grader unless they already understand the basic ideas of chess.
2,Didn't like the writing style - not for the young reader,I have read a fair number of chess books. I felt that the writing style in this book made the concepts more diffcult to grasp than necessary - tends to be a bit jumpy. There are better books out there - look around some more if you are considering this book. This is definately not a book for anyone under 14.
1,Mixed Up,I have decided to write some reviews on the books my fahter picked for me and ordered. This was one of the worst of them. Mr. Weramantry who I have reaseared has never written another book on chess since this one. I am glad.The book jumps around too much without explaining things in it so that you can understand it. The book says the writter is some big time chess teacher but he doesn't know doddily when it comes to putting his teaching into words. I found the book hard and difficult for a kid who has been playing on his chess team for over a year at his school and is ranked as number 2.
5,Very good example games to enhance chess thinking,"This book would be beyond the absolute chess beginner, since just learning to make moves is their primary focus.However, for the avid chess player, one who plays in tournaments, at a chess club, in a school program, or who just plays every chance s/he gets, this is a wonderful book to help improve the understanding of the game. It is so well written that one who can visualize a short sequence of moves (1 or 2) need not use a chess board to fully understand the games discussed. Mr. Weeramantry has written the book as a coach would teaches a student, often asking his student a question about a given position, and then explaining why the student's best response would be good or not so good. If not so good, he asks for another choice.This book (for a chess book) was very easy to read. I'm a class A tournament player who completely enjoyed reading it,... and re-reading it."
4,Easy Reading,"Chess has fascinated players for thousands of years, but to become a strong players takes years of work and necessitates pouring through reams of tedious chess manuals. Every once in a while you come across the obvious exception. Weeramantry's book is the easiest reading chess book I have yet come across. Filled with useful tidbits about all aspects of play, Best Lessons of a Chess Coach reminds me of nothing so much as a conversation between a chess master and a student. This image is reinforced by the constant illustrations and references to games that Weeramantry employes. It read just like a series of professional chess lessons.While the book is intended for the intermediate player it offers useful insights into various opening systems and middlegame plans for players of all levels. I remember reading this book on the bus, at the airport, amid the bustle at work, and in various other places where it would normally seem impossible to study a chess book."
4,Nice instructive book for beginner/intermediate player,"I have read more than a dozen instructive books on chess and find this a nice easy read with games and commentary that provide a well focussed view of the lessons that Mr. Weeramantry is teaching. These include the basics such as strong outposts, weak color squares, etc. Once the student has digested classics such as Chernev's Logical Chess Move by Move, he/she is ready for this book. Has elements of Silman's The Amateur's Mind, but at an easier level. Good for Class C player and below I think."
4,"Great album, despite the screaming","This was a real good album that could have been better were it not for the singer. Udo's screaming gets to be like fingernails on a chalkboard and after a while you just want him to shut up and let the musicians take over. No wonder they booted this ugly little elf out of the band. He did a much better job singing on Balls to the Wall. Despite the screaming, the songs are great, especially the title cut, midnight mover, and Living for Tonight. Put a muzzle on that little screaming creep and you'd have a fantastic album instead of just a good one."
2,Five stars? Do you really know Accept?,"The last ""acceptable"" Accept album was ""Balls to the Wall"", released before this ""Metal Heart"". I think some people who reviw here don't know that 5 star-rating should be used to a classic rock, inside a band's career and style. ""Metal Heart"" paved the way for the downfall of the band, being extremely commercial. Look at the songs titles: ""Screaming for a Love Bite""?!! What's that? If you wanna know Accept, buy ""Breaker"", ""Restless and WIld"", ""Balls to the Wall"" or ""I'm a Rebel""."
4,Unheralded in Its Day,"Heavy metal may have reached its peak around 1985, and so did Accept. More polished than its predecesors (""Restless & Wild"" and ""Balls to the Wall) with more energy than the follow-up ""Russian Roulette,"" ""Metal Heart showcases everything that was right with Not-Quite-Mainstream-Because-No-Radio-Station-Would-Play-It '80s metal.The work here presents some hich-octane burners (""Midnight Mover,"" ""Up to the Limit,"" ""Too High to Get It Right,"" and ""Living for Tonight""), as well some smoldering selections (""Screaming for a Love-Bite,"" ""Dogs on Leads""). There are also a couple of songs that move a bit beyond the ordinary fare with the title track and ""Bound to Fail.""Some listeners may be turned off by the less accesible ""Wrong is Right"" and ""Teach Us to Survive"" and the adolescent nature of some of the lyrics, but if your looking for an album to propel you back to a time when music (and the fans) had more raw energy, this album is a sure bet."
5,ACCEPT's turningpoint,"This album really made a difference to ACCEPT. For the first time in their carreer they became superstars. The ""Metal Heart"" album shows a band that can turn to where the wind blows. And by 1985 that wind was called the commercial wind. To survive in the showbiz of heavy metal you had to go for the bigger audience and the bigger money. So they did. ACCEPT lost a lot of devoted fans, but gained even more fans. Every so called devoted fan that turned their backs on ACCEPT in 1985 did not understand the heart and soul of the band. Their mission was to make good music. With this album ACCEPT finally got into the big league. Commercial....yes...so what!! By 1985 you had to go commercial unless you wanted to play for nickels and dimes. The music is brilliant. The album ""Metal Heart"" is forever carved in golden letters in the Hall of fame of 80's Heavy Metal. Buy it now, and experience a band at it's peak. The tracks are awsome..every singel one of them."
4,Not aggressive enough,"This album isn't quite as good as most of Accept's albums, but it's still quite good. Although this album is overproduced, there are still saome great songs such as (this one has some of the best lyrics in a hard rock song ever!) ""Wrong Is Right,"" ""Midnight Mover,"" ""Up To The Limit,"" & the title song. The album cover looks neat also."
3,fair metal doesnt hold candle to restless &wild!!!!!!!!,this album is o.k. but it definetly does not have the heart or the grit to stand up to the restless and wild c.d. something was missing on this one.
3,A good solid hard rock album,"If you liked Balls to the Wall, you'll like this one too. Not as commercially accepted but just as much hard rocking."
4,FlipAlbum,"This program is the best one I've found for viewing photos. I've scanned all of my old photo albums and created CDs to give to family members, and it's been really easy cataloging new photos as I take them (digital). The mp3 feature in the new version has been great. Some people have complained that the program doesn't have a photo-editing feature, but I already have Photoshop (and I think most scanners and digital cameras come with some sort of software)."
3,Order 4.1 from website,If you order this suite 4.0 you will have to download a 15 mg upgrade to 4.1 and also download two design CD's. In the end you spend more money when you order this outdated new product.
1,"A religious history of the Scot Irish, not a history of the people","Unless you are really interested in all the petty arguments about religion among the protestant, presbyterians and baptists this book is not for you. Data on the Scots Irish people themselves makes up less than 25% of this book and even then it is more into quoting what this official or that official had to say. You don't really get a feel for what the people were like or why they were the way they were.If you want to understand our ancestors and what drove them, read ""Born Fighting : How the Scots-Irish Shaped America"" by James Webb. Not only does it bring these early settlers to life but tickled my intestests enough to buy more books on the over-mountain people and Andrew Jackson."
3,It Could Be Better,"I bought this book because of the great reviews I read about it and with the hope that it will give me some realistic and clear-cut advice on how to practise PR and what exactly PR is all about. Despite the fact that this book provides a very easy reading with real-life examples (limited to the authors company), there is a lot of simplicity and repetition to the extend that the reader may skip entire sentenses in order to spare himself the trouble of reading the same stuff again. Furthermore, the information given is neither new nor enlightening for any reader who has some basic Business Administration knowledge. I enjoyed very much a couple of the author's tips and examples but other than that I would recommend this book only to true beginners, i.e. college students or people from totally irrelevant disciplines (e.g. architects)."
4,Public Relations Kit For Dummies,"Boring. Felt like I was in school listening to Mrs. McCumbre. I will admit I learned though. Hard to get through the whole book. Although, I'm glad I did."
5,Public Relations Kit For Dummies,"Not bad for a PR book. The author seems to take great pride in how different his ""approach"" to pr is. It's not."
1,"Why do I get the feeling the ""customer"" reviews for this...","...are phony? Maybe because they all say the same thing? Maybe because they are all from a ""reader in Major City, USA"". I can't pinpoint it, but c'mon. Twenty reviewers have nothing else to say but that it was well written with organized chapters and the writer is oh so smart and amazing and WAS ON TELEVISION!"
5,Public Relations Kit For Dummies,"From the forward written by the President of IKEA to the endorsements from William Lauder to the chairman of Hill and Knowlton (largest pr firm in the world, I believe?)to the man who owns the Shaker Furniture Collection to the President of Hain Foods to PR Week to the table of contents. Absolutely first class. Chapters are well laid out. Content is amazing. Real case study examples. Bright author. Incredible experience.Interesting war stories. Great reference.Wonder how much pr the pr guy got for his book? Or if that's why he wrote the book at all? Even so...I'm only jealous! Great, wonderful, smart, insightful book."
2,A comparison...but why?,"Old school dub and new school dub are two indisputably different things; however, this sampler not only juxtaposes the two but mixes them to a certain extent as well. New school dub lovers will enjoy the subtle 'new school' overhauls of esp. Black Uhuru's or Burning Spear's tracks on the album's first half whereas they may be somewhat disappointed by the album's second half, which is characterized by spun-out, more or less uneventful new school artists' dubs. The producers would have done well to include some more divergent modern dub bands; apart from the inevitable Mad Professor and the vintage 'rastafari' by Alpha&Omega, the new school half is just a bit too monotonous. Most dub fans will either like the first or the second part; nevertheless this album is a nice, albeit superfluous attempt at comparing two eras of dub. For a clearer picture you'd be better off buying yourself two separate CD's with some classic dubs both from the 70s and from the 90s."
2,Mediocre at best,"I thought that LSG 2 sounded mediocre as a whole. It sounded like throwaway tracks left in the studio that could have been on a Gerald Levert album. I hate to say this, but the Gerald Levert-produced songs on LSG2 are some of the worst I've ever heard from him for this trio. Most of the album is disjointed and Keith Sweat doesn't sound his best on here. Johnny Gill sounds disconnected from the songs. And Gerald sounds like he wants to lead the group, because he's the only good singer on this album. Even the guest appearances by Loon and another rapper don't blend well with the group. I can tell why this album flopped. I can't believe their label delayed their group's album so much, because people were excited for it. LSG's superior 1997 album was far, far better than this mediocre effort."
4,Soph. CD good vibes...,this new release to me is better than the first project. they are doing what they do best; slow-tempo and ballads.. i would rather hear more of JG and less of Keith Sweat - my personal preference. all and all it's a solid Soph. release. i can't wait for the New Edition release on Bad Boy...
5,Better than the first....,This CD has been underrated by some reviewers on here. This CD is great. LSG has came back together again to make a compilation of soulful ballads... BUY IT! The only problem that I had was that there were only 11 tracks on it.... I wanted more!
2,"""What Happened?""","When my husband heard that LSG had a new CD, he ran out and bought it. Well, I listened to it and I just have one question, ""What Happened?"" The formula used for the first CD was thrown out the window with this one. I was very disappointed with this CD."
2,average,pretty average at best.these three Guys each have a interesting take with music.but COmbined it truly adds nothing overall.these tracks are standard&pretty much feel like they were phoned in overall.considering there Commerical success as Solo Artists you'd expect to hear a Legit hit but nothing stands out.
2,Good idea but not much content,"Instead of spending money on this book, it would probably be more beneficial to find a similar article online or watch the TV show. Not much content in the book--lots of pictures."
5,Awesome and Inspiring,"After hearing these young men sing in our local church, I was delighted to find their CD on your website. The music is so inspirational, and I especially like the cuts they perform without musical accompaniment. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys contemporary christian music."
4,A Fantastic Tale,"This a fantastic tale that stretches your imagination and keeps you glued to the pages. A great fantasy, I couldn't put it down."
4,A Book With Eye Opening Reality,"Horn of Darkness tells the story of a family of three commencing on a quest to de-horn 10 rhinos. Discovering complications and adapting to the surroundings is just one of the many challenges Joel, Carol and young Sonja have to face. For me (being an 11 year old doing a reserch project) it was perfect for references and surprisingly it had a wonferfully enjoyable story. I thought it covered what I needed to know and at the same time I experienced first hand the wonders of the rhino as well as the realities of poaching problems. Not all adults will enjoy this book as much as I but if you give it a chance and open your mind you will enjoy what it has to offer. I suggest this book for ages 11 (curious 11 year olds)-and up."
3,tough read at times,"a good book for the wildlife enthusiast, but kinda boring at times. Not every day in real life can be as exciting as a Hollywood movie so this is accurate representation of what it must be like, but it takes a real passion for the animal kingdom to read it. It has been a couple of years since I read it so it isn't very fresh in my mind, but I did enjoy parts of it very much."
3,Good Songs,"Even though there are some really wonderful songs on this CD, there are also some that I do not care for; therefore, I only gave the CD 3 stars. This CD has various songs by various singers. Some of the really good songs on this CD are: ""That's the Way Love Goes"" by Merle Haggard, ""Good Ol' Boys"" by Waylon Jennngs, ""All My Rowdy Friends Have Settled Down"", by Hank Williams, Jr., ""Lookin' for Love"" by Johnny Lee, and ""I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool"" by Barbara Mandrell. If all the songs were this good, I would have given the CD 5 Stars."
3,is anyone else as tired of middle aged angst as i am?,"a french canadian ""big chill"" 20 years later, as a group of even older now friends reunite in anticipation of the coming death of one of their number. good, but ive been down this road before."
1,Incompetent Authoring,"This is one of those discs where the 16X9 enhancement isn't compatible with many players, producing a squeezed image if you don't have a 16X9 TV. This needs to be repressed. I don't know what the film is like because everything appeared as thin as toothpicks (and no, it was not because my player was set wrong--it is always set to Normal: LB).I've gotten a ton of unhelpful votes for this review, so I'll add that I contacted the Disney/Miramax troubleshooting hotline printed on the disc, and after the technician walked me through all the troubleshooting steps, he CONCEDED that the DVD is INCOMPATIBLE with my player. With that fact presented, anyone who tries to bury this review as unhelpful simply because it is negative is (unfortunately, anonymously) demonstrating themselves tro be a true jerk determined to keep customers from making an informed decision. No company, particularly one as large as Disney, should be making DVDs that are incompatible with some players."
2,Not as implied,"This film was supposed to be about a dying father reconciling with his estranged son. I didn't get that. Instead I got a father who strikes up a relationship with a drug addict. What happens to the son? After he tries to make his father's life as comfortable as possible, he disappears into the background until the melodramatic ending. If the screewriter/director had focused more on the father and son's relationship DURING the film instead of the father and drug addict's relationship then the ENDING when the father and son come together would've made more sense. This film was not as it was implied to be, and for the life of me--I don't understand how it won the Oscar. That should've gone to ""Osama"" instead. I also would've given it to ""L'Auberge Espagnole."""
1,Politically Correct Schmaltz,"I whole-heartedly agree with David Light's review. This was a stupid, pretentious, totally affected movie. Who really cares about any of these people? The only thing that could have made any of it convincing or believable would be if we learned the son was paying EVERYONE to be there and act so f'ing moved by this useless man's useless death. The scene where he turns over his classroom evoking nothing but presumably well-earned and richly deserved apathy from his students was the only truly genuine moment in the film, as he walks down the hall so easily replaced and immediately forgotten.Would be more aptly titled ""Invasion of the Self-Absorbed Narcissists"" If I could give it fewer than zero stars, I would."
2,Over rated movie and not universal appeal,"I think it's bit over rated movie. It's neither poetic or nor emotional.Too much grabage sex talk does not mean, funny or emotional.I still did not understand a man, who raised their kids as strong (atleast in their words in movie) can think of stupid movie star legs just before death instead of any of his family members or atleast his wife or kid who invaded many ways to please his dad.If you really want to know about death, better watch ""Wit"". If you need more better choice in life and death subject, watch ""million doller baby"".This movie may please native audiance, but not universal appeal. Do not know it's worth Oscar."
2,Why the bashing of the Canadian Health System?...,"I saw the film and in the end I felt kind of disappointed. I am no sure what kind of message the film wanted to bring to us. It just did not impress me. I also can't understand how the moviemaker tried to, hatefully, demolish the Canadian Health Care System without proposing anything in its place. Very destructive. I bet the US health corporations will love the film since for years they have been trying to demoralize the Canadian Health Care in frequent and expensive TV adds. I even wonder if they have something to do with the film..."
3,Sub Titles,Not much on watching a movie with sub titles. Might be a great movie but just could not keep up with it with the sub titles.
5,Life-changing book,"This book changed my life. I had always had a vague feeling that a city, a house, a chair could be too large, too small or just right, but I did not realize anyone had carefully quantified just what is the best size for these things until I read this book. It is because of this book that I moved to a town of 35,000 people, and have been delighted with that choice for the last 10 years"
3,Bengals Art Glass Lamp,"I must say, I am not completely satisfied with this lamp. I was expecting an honest to goodness GLASS lamp in glass pieces... We have an actual stained glass lamp we purchased from HSN for 99.00 and it was what we expected. On this one here, each panel of ""glass"" is one piece, not in actual glass pieces. It almost seems like it is plastic instead of glass. I was not really satisfied, but it is cute for a small lamp. Since it was a Christmas present, I will not return it, BUT if it were just me buying it because I wanted a glass lamp, I would return it because it was not what I wanted. A bit overpriced for it not being actual glass. Maybe I didn't completely understand the type of lamp it was, but like I stated, it isn't what I thought it would be."
3,And exciting story but with too many side tracks,The story for the most part is exciting and suspenseful. However the author has a bad habit of going off on tangents about his personal opinions about homosexuals. Those parts could have been left out as they did nothing for the theme of the story.
5,Dead Reckoning,DEAD RECKONING is a fast moving book that I just could not put down. Both this book and BRAINSTORM would make great action movies! Loved the characters and surprises along the way. Read book in one night! Was actually a great.book for Memorial Day weekend! GOD BLESS ALL OUR SERVICE MEN & WOMEN
2,Turned into a bondage/porno fest! What a shame.,"Dead Reckoning was moving along nicely, when out of left field some rediculous terribly out-of-character, sex scenes turn up. It was as though they were yanked out of another book and stuck in this one, while the author wasn't looking. I'm no prude... but it really bolluxed up the story. I perused through that part and then just put it aside as crap."
4,Bag Boy Aluminum Pull Cart (Silver),"As advertised! Easy to set up,hols my golf bag and is easy to pull. The only ""downside"" is the weather protector for the scorecard makes it hard to keep a car on but I keep my card in my pocket. Best cart I have owened."
4,A Must-Have For All Fans!,"Very informative, lots of detail. The research is very indepth, and is well structured and easy to read."
2,First Gear breaks screws,"I had an older 12v Dewalt drill that I used around a farm and other places for over 9 years. After the second set of batteries started to die on me and the drill started showing some bearing wear, I decided to get a new one. The 3 speeds seem nice even with the extra weight that comes with it.I do have a problem with the clutch mechanism while the drill is in first gear. Even at the lowest setting, the clutch does not release while the drill is in first gear and breaks off the heads of screws. The clutch does work in second gear and is down right loose in third, however it would be nice to be able to use first gear so as to slowly drive a screw without worrying about the head snapping off. I returned the drill and got a second one thinking it was an adjustment problem. The second one has the same problem. I am now thinking of returning this model drill and getting a Panasonic or other brand."
1,They're not what they used to be,"The newer production 12-volt drill drivers aren't worth your money. do some more research (as I am in the process of) and get something else!My first Dewalt 12-volt drill driver (from 1993- or 94) was great, versitile, heavy-duty, and the batteries lasted longer than their spec'd work time. It finally started wearing down when it got to 10 years old and I bought two new batteries for it--they didn't perform well, one would work great for 10 minutes and die while the other would work at about 60% power and die 12 hours later.I finally got a whole new Dewalt 12-volt system last fall and both batteries are terrible. Each lasts for about 20 minutes tops worktime (1 and 1/2 hours on the job, medium duty woodwork or drywall hanging). I'm really disappointed in this product and will steer away from Dewalt products in the future."
3,More information needed,"Is it possible for you to please provide more information. Is this the missal with the new order, for Advent 2011?"
1,"Garbage, like all the books of Andrew Gordon","All the productos of Andrew Gordon are garbage. He plays easy patterns on his computer, later print the sheets without making a good transcription. I bought all his books but now they are with no use, and never they will be used. There are other better options."
4,Decent book about conquering depression,"Sharon Winslow's finance never makes it back from WWI. The book as a whole covers many many years. As usual, there are some rather nice twists. The part that dragged a bit was her depression. Most of the time I was like ""okay, get over it"" - maybe that's just me being cynical.A decent addition to the House of Winslow series."
2,not great yet,"has not worked yet . 2 weeks nothing , started again 10 days , 1 popped out of 30 , bummed"
4,Works like a Charm,I have used my ez clone 30 for the past few years and have had excellent results. Water temperature has never been an issue for me - but I do keep the unit in a basement where temps are cooler. I also keep it on the tile floor which really helps modulate the water temp.
1,"Water Temp is too high, try turboklone","EZ - Clone 60EZ - Clone 60Indoor growers should consider purchasing the Turboklone prior to purchasing the ez clone. Be warned that the ez clone product does not run at optimum cloning temperatures. Use of this product requires tedious water temperature management such as using timers, using a water chiller ($300+), adding ice, raising the lights above optimum height, storing in a cool room below optimum grow room temperatures, etc. EZ Clone boasts a return rate of less than 1% ([...]); however, you will encounter great difficulties in your attempt to return the product. Upon your attempted return, EZ Clone may inform you that you are able to clone with water temperatures of 85F, your heat problem is a product of your cleaning methods, etc. The bottom line is: save yourself the time, water temperature control challenges, and poor customer service. Buy Turboklone! Turboklone has a water temperature control system."
5,Momumental Movement,The man and the CD moved me. I recently heard it (I believe it was 3 times in one night) while sharing a bottle of wine with new friends. They were the ones who introduced me to this man who calls himself Ben. He sings from his soul and seems to have a very deep one. This is a must have for anyone who wants to make monumental movements in their life. A must have for soulful walks!
4,Wow,"This movie has changed my life. I'll never look at life, birth, or myself the same again.Beautiful imagery and a gentle flow guide the audience through the labor of Naoli Vinaver Lopez and the birth of her first daughter, Tamaya. The strength of Naoli, and the calm way she handles herself during the birth are poignant images to juxtapose to the view of birth in today's hurried society. The most interesting point she makes, is that birth does not need to hurt, it can be a beautiful, wonderful, exhilarating expierence, and your family can be a part of it. Quite an interesting movie, and worth a view if you're thinking about beginning a family, or adding a new member to your current one."
3,birth day,"I found this a lovely birth to watch, but investment wise for my classes it was not good value, it was very short and was not very educational for women wanting a natural birth in hospital, it focussed only on one personal home birth story briefly."
5,A Shared Experience,"If you are planning on having children EVER! the video ""BIRTH DAY"" is a must see. It shows you not only how birth can be, but how, in my opinion, it should be. My husband and I had our daughter at home with a lay midwife and it was the most beautiful, empowering experience we have ever had. Most women do not even know it is an option. You will miss something unequaled in life if you choose to do a 'medicalized birth'. A home birth bonds you to your spouse, your baby and the entire process of life like you will never experience in a hospital or clinic. Get ""BIRTH DAY""!!!-Dr. Jeanine Tgettis"
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I thought that I was ordering a movie that showed multiple women giving birth at home. What this actually is, is 1 woman, who gives birth at home in Mexico. And they actually only show an 11 minute clip of her in labor, and then the actual birth. Any natural laboring sounds she made was covered up by music.The rest of the DVD (which makes up the majority of the content) is all interviews with her, her husband, her parents, and another mom who watched this before giving birth.I am very disappointed with this DVD, as I ordered it to watch, then show to my children to prepare them for our upcoming homebirth. It's getting returned & I'll search for a better one."
5,My Favorite Childbirth DVD/Video,"I'm a doula and childbirth educator working primarily with couples who are planning a hospital birth. However I always show this beautifully made documentary because I want them to see how natural and normal the birth process can be.Because it's such a short DVD I take it with me to a prenatal visit and we watch it at the end. Without fail, by the time the film is over the parents have snuggled close together, hugging and kissing and obviously very moved by the visual impact of the birth.Even the most squeamish fathers seem to be able to handle this movie and are reassured that their presence and support at the birth are very important. If you only buy one DVD or video for your lending/teaching library, this is the one to get!"
5,A truth that needs to be told,"Birth Day is one of the very few films that I am willing to show WITHOUT RESERVATION to my birth classes. It is a beautiful, rich and real film. I have watched it dozens of times, and I never tire of it - in fact, every time I see it, I like it more. I don't have to pause the tape and add commentary or remind the viewers that umbilical cords should not be cut immediatelly and that babies should not be removed from their mothers. Birth Day tells a simple truth about birth - a truth that needs to be told over and over again in a culture such as ours."
2,Technically Proficient,"This tawdry collection of stereotypes receives two stars because the author bothered to make them into actual Haiku.There are some barley clever ones (maybe 2), but after shelling out the money, I said to myself ""what the hell am I going to do with this now?""Save your money."
2,Watch out--Not Lovey Dovey,"I actually picked this book up at a bookstore as an impulse gift for my boyfriend. I am in the habilt of writing love haikus to him and thought seeing this book was kismit. Well, I made the mistake of giving it to him without reading some of the haikus. Instead of sweet, loving poems, it was filled with bitter ascerbic ""break up"" haikus that gave both of us a queezy feeling. It really was a downer for our blossoming relationship. I asked for, and was granted, an indugence to take back the gift, which I returned to the bookstore. My haikus will have to do."
5,An all time favorite,A charming and colorfully illustrated book to share with your truck-loving 2-4 year-old. I never tire of reading this to my son who likewise loves the rhymes and pictures AND the tow trucks!
3,Great but easily stolen !,I loved these on my MINI's OEM roof bars.... until they got stolen. They simply screw around the bars with thumb screws. Just walked up to my car today and they were gone ! I wish there was a way to lock them to the bars.
5,Gospel Stars Bare Their Hearts and Souls,"Gospel music's greats talk about the spiritual setbacks in their lives and how God entered the picture to point them in the right direction.CeCe Winans, Kirk Franklin, John Kee -- you name the star and here is their behind-the-scenes story of spiritual strife and struggle. A very, very inspirational read for lovers of Gospel music!"
5,Used School Books,I buy my childs books every year to have a set at home. Every book I have bought thru Amazon have been Great! They are like new books for a low price.
5,Best 4 x 6 printer out....Cheap refills,"Great sized refill for the PictureMate. This is the best small sized printer for quality, color and longevity.This size package is really convenient too."
2,NOT FOR PM260,I purchased this print pack when purchasing the PM260 printer. It came up as a suggested item to add on. Didn't mention it the ink cartridge is the wrong size!!! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRINT PACK FOR THE PM260. It doesn't work!!
2,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PM-260!!!,"This pack is NOT for the portable <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Epson-PictureMate-Compact-Inkjet-Printer/dp/tech-data/B000UMRWCC/ref=de_a_smtd"">PM-260 ""PictureMate Dash"" unit</a>. The paper is compatible, but the ink cartridges are the wrong size.Make sure you're buying the right package and before you open the plastic bag with the ink cartridge, make sure it's going to fit into your printer."
1,Dont purchase this item,I paid $65 for this pack and the quality is terrible. Not sure how long it had been sitting in storage before they sent it to me. Please do not waste your money. Do not buy this item.
1,The Print Cartriges Don't Fit The PictureMate Snap,"I purchased this paper and ink package at the same time I purchased an Epson PictureMate Snap 4x6 Photo Printer from Amazon. The ink cartridges didn't fit the Snap printer, and I returned the package to Amazon. I had a hard time finding cartridges for the Snap printer, so it may be fairly new and the cartridges hard to find in the after market. That being said, I am sure the paper and ink will be just fine if you have the printer they are designed for."
1,You must be joking!,"I have never received this package. It was not delivered. I reported this fact to you the next day after it was supposed to have been delivered. I have yet to hear from you what happened. Maybe someday you will find it.Sincerely unhappy,Arthur Ewers"
5,PictureMate Print Pack,Epson PictureMate Print Pack (2 Ink Cartridges/270 sheet of Glossy Photo Paper)-T5570-270Order was what I expected and I am very pleased with it.
1,Wrong Item,"This item came up when I purchased the printer....made an assumption that it was the correct item that Amazon was prompting me to purchase. Turned out to be for a different printer, however the good news is that Amazon refunded the full amount to me and I purchased the correct item. All ended wonderful!!"
1,Everythig ro make a photo!,This is what is needed to make the Picture Mate work!..new paper and new ink cartridges..now I can send some of my digital images to friends to keep and show around..
2,Not for the beginner.,"I used this text book when I was a student and found it confusing because it often skipped steps and used short-cuts in analysis. Simple, straight-forward, explainations are best for the beginning engineering student. This was not a good beginner's book. On the positive side, it may be a good reference book for the experienced civil engineer."
1,This Organ is Not Ready for Primetime,"I really like the music on this album and the sound of the organ, but tracks 3 through 11 has so much noise from this organ in need of repair that it is unbearable to listen to. At first I thought the compact disk was defective till I read in the booklet that this organ was on life support for this recording. I returned this album for a refund. If a recording is ever made of this organ with the music on this disk I would not hesitate to buy it if the organ is repaired and in good working order."
2,"Not too entertaining, but I still LUV the show...","This book is an average. It's not too exciting though, because much of it is history, and history is monotonous. Also, this book moves at a snail speed. The author should write for nonfiction books, not action books. Fans of the EXCELLENT show (da bomb baby) should read Coyote Moon, Halloween Rain, or the new books."
2,Not all that great.....,"As a major fan of the show (having created a scrapbook, having every episode on tape, and having pics up on my bedroom wall), I found this the least favorite of mine in the new book series. I've read all of them up to ""Blooded."" And this one, didn't seem to catch my eye all that much and wasn't all that realistic. It didn't carry the same excitement as the other books in the series. The plot to me was confusing. I do not recommend this book. I think it was a waste of my time. I am however looking forward to the Watcher's Guide coming in October. That's gonna be really cool. :0)"
1,Not even close!,"I have seen all the episodes (except for one of them), and I have read all the books, and have read lots of the fan fiction out there... Most of them do the show quite a bit of justice, but this one was just terrible. The storyline was nearly impossible to follow, the characters were constantly saying or doing something completely OUT of character for them. (I have yet to hear Giles use even half that amount of common slang) and all in all I would rather be forced to watch bad reruns of 90210 or Barney than to have to try to struggle through this particular book again. All the others are great! Both series are great and I look forward to each new book, but this one will be leaving my possession in tiny pieces."
1,"Avoid at all costs!!! (Yes, even if free!)","Utterly terrible, boring, and cliche. The plot involves the Salem Witch Trials, reincarnation, and zombies, which I'm not saying can't work, it just didn't with this one. Not one thing or person in this book bore any resemblance to those in the series, other than using the same names, and the dialogue was beyond awkward. I'm not even sure the author ever saw the show. Everything was so cardboard. No, I'm wrong, it was far worse than that, more like cardboard that had been out in a torrential downpour. For a week. Gross, soggy, mushy cardboard. Not recommended at all."
2,It sounded so good on the back cover...,"I first read this book over three years ago and didn't like it. But then, a few weeks ago, I decided to see how much my taste in books had matured and gave it another chance. Big mistake! I hate this book! They took a wonderful concept and blew it to smithereens by ruining Giles and Xander. I would have felt better if they'd somehow discovered that the real Giles and Xander had been locked in a warehouse for the duration of this novel and had been replaced by cyborgs because only that could explain why the heck they were saying such stupid stuff!Not only were they horrible, but the supposed climax of the novel - the zombie diner fight scene - was over waaay too fast and easily. It completely and irreparably damaged my spirit. The books only saving grace was some fun quips from the Buffster and a sweet (albeit, paranormal) kiss between Willow and Xander at the very end. I would recommend Coyote Moon and Halloween Rain in a heartbeat over this book."
3,It was OK,"Out of all of the Buffy books I have read, this was most definatly not the best. It had a good story line and it was a complelling read, but to my mind there was two thing wrong with it. Firstly the character of Giles was not always British enough, he often used American slang terms which are not in keeping with his character. Secondly Buffy refers to dieing, but this book also had the master in it, and as all fans know Buffy died and then killed the master, so this proved the auther was not as ""up"" on Buffy as the fans would like. Appart from this the book was very good."
4,quite good........,"This was the second buffy book i read the first bein visitors and i thot i wuld try this, see if they were good but no such luck.This was a good book and it was funny when Willow and Xander got possesed but where was the rest of the charecters giles was never in it and buffy neither and this is called BUFFY the vampire slayer.It dealt with the past more than present day.It was good but buy another book thankfully i got this out the library."
3,Perhaps just another collector's item...,"Arthur Byron Cover's ""Night of the Living Rerun"" is my least favorite book in the series to date. As a fan of the television show, I found numerous discrepancies when reviewed in parallel. Not only was the book difficult to read (I had to go back and reread portions of the book to follow the plot), but I think some of the characters were not portrayed accurately when compared to the television series. The plot centers around past lives and recurring history... basically a plot that has been gone over many times before. History repeats itself and so on. I do have to mention that Cover mentioned Cordelia and Angel, which seems to be a first in the history of this series... of course, the mentions are small and don't contribute to the plot. If you're a collector of the Buffy series, you'll want to get this book, but others might find it a hard read with an unsatisfactory plot."
2,Best for casual Buffy fans,"I just finished reading this book and was disappointed by it. The author obviously didn't know the show and the characters well so he chose to write more about characters and events from the past than he did about the characters of Buffy. There were a few interesting parts. The showdown with the Master and the possessed characters wasn't bad although I wouldn't have staged it at a steakhouse. I don't know what that was about. But on the whole, if you are looking for action, you will find it. But if you are truly immersed in Buffyness, I would try another book."
1,Not the Slayer at her best,"This is one of the most forgettable ""Buffy"" books I have read thus far. The plot wasn't one, and when it seemed it was going somewhere, it hit a brick wall with a loud thud. There were these different elements that just didn't fit into one another. I think the only thing I enjoyed, is how the characters from the past matched with those from today, except for Willow, which was revealed at the end. I think the ending was the best part, actually, because of that. It was just very choppy, and the characterization (which I am very big on) was very awkward. Not a must-read."
2,"Good, but could of been a lot better","This book was not brutal, but it is probably the worst of all the Buffy novel's so far. Usually I would read one of the Buffy books in two days, but it took me almost two weeks to finish this one. It is so slow, and at the start it seems to be going no where -- not what a good Buffy book should be like. The characters aren't really that good in this either, and the dialogue is really bad"
1,Don't waste your time...,"""Night of the Living Rerun"" is, by far, the WORST of the Buffy novels. The author obviously has no understanding of the characters and only a basic knowledge of the premise. The characters were trite, the references inconsistent at best (completely wrong at worst!), the premise was shaky, and the storyline unsalvageable.Do yourselves a favor - skip over this book and go directly to ""Blooded"". I guarantee you much more bang for your buck..."
4,Nice product!,This noise maker works great. It can be very loud or you can keep it quieter. The different settings are nice for mixing it up as well.
5,Nature sounds machine,This is a really good machine. I bought it for my son for Christmas. He has been using it every night for 2 years. He likes to have noise in his room when he sleeps. It's very easy to use and has been very reliable. I would definitely buy this again.
3,"Great sound, poor quality","I loved this product when I first got it. The sound is good and the unit is very easy to use. After a couple of months it started to short out. It seems to be in the area where you plug in the cord. It works fine with batteries, but I would rather plug it in than constantly replace the batteries. I noticed that other people were having the same problem, so I wonder if this is a defect in the unit? I love the brand, so will probably still try a different model of theirs."
2,Not Worth It!!,"This is our second HoMedics sound machine. Our first one basically stopped working after about 9 months. As some of the other reviewers mentioned, it ""shorts out"" when you turn the knob and sometimes it wouldn't come on at all. Figuring it was just a bad one, we decided to give it another shot and bought it again. BIG MISTAKE! This one developed the same problem after only about 3 weeks. We've learned our lesson and will not be using a HoMedics product again. Hope they fix this design flaw! Be wary of purchasing this product!"
2,let down,"I bought this product because the HoMedics model I wanted has been discontinued. The HoMedics SS-2000 Sound Spa broke about 5 weeks after I began using it. Amazon did a great job of sending me a new product with no hassle. The added effects of seagulls on the ocean setting is more annoying than relaxing. My advice, go to a store and try it out the sounds before buying it. If you like the sound settings come back to Amazon and buy here."
1,"Bought it, tried it, returned it!","I was so excited to finally get a sound machine, after a coworker of mine had been talking up her own and saying how great it was for restful sleep.This machine has six functions, and after testing out each one, I found that they all seem to be a 30 second sound clip that merely repeats itself over and over and over throughout the night. Something about hearing the same exact seagull squawk in the ocean sound every 30 seconds drove me nuts! I had to turn it off because I just could not get relaxed.You're better off buying $20 of relaxation songs off iTunes and playing them through your iPod than buying this machine. At least then, you can pick what sound you want to listen to, and it'll be much better composed and more random - allowing for better relaxation - than the machine's sounds."
4,Loud enough to block noise out,"If you're going for a cheap sound machine that is loud enough to block out noise, this is a great option. I bought two (one for each of my kids), and it's really helped them from waking one another up. I've had one of these before, and it didn't last a long time. I don't expect these to last a long time either even though we take good care of them and only use them for nap and night time. I don't think they're designed to last long. But I think this is the best option for the price."
2,"Went dead after a short life span, wouldn't buy again","We bought this because our neighbors are loud and I am a light sleeper, and we thought it was a great price. It worked fine for a little while, and the timer feature is nice, but it started to get harder and harder to wiggle it and keep it from shorting out. Now it is completely dead and we have to replace it. I'll be spending a little more to get one that actually works!"
2,Does not last a YEAR !,"We have now had three of these units fail in less than a year. The volume knob will short out. First you will hear static when adjusting the volume,then after time it will die. Yes it is cheap but spend a little more to get something that will last longer."
5,Love,"I've had this for awhile now and have had absolutley no problems with it. I don't use the 15/30 minute feature, I just keep it plugged in and it runs all night. I almost always use the ""rain"" sound, but it comes with rainforest, heartbeat, rain, ocean, and crickets. It's inexpensive and works just like the more elaborate ones. It's super lightweight too. I'd recommend it."
3,"Not a bad machine, but short life span","The sounds generated are not bad, but I have been through three of these over an eight year span. I don't know what the life expectancy is supposed to be for one of these devices, but I suspect they should last longer than what I have experienced. Like another user mentioned, mine have also shorted out after a while and they all became difficult to tune into a sound and maintain a steady stream of sound over a long period of time.It is time for me to move on to another more durable model. Not a bad little machine if you only use it on occasion, but I depend on it every night and it has disappointed over the long term."
5,Perfect for traveling,Love that this will operate on batteries and has several sounds options. We use at home and for travel. It is small but sound can be adjusted to the perfect setting for the white noise our baby needs. Perfect for our needs.
2,Great but unreliable,"We have had several of these over the past several years to block noise. While we have been happy with the sounds, I'm not happy with how unreliable it is. We have had to replace these several times due to shorting. It will be making the sound and then all of a sudden.... silence. Then it will start back up again. After a while it does seem to keep going without the stops, but we've played with it a lot (ie. tried unplugging it versus using the switch to turn it on and off). Anyway. Some last longer than others before the shorting problem starts, but thye ALL seem to eventually develop this problem. I don't usually write reviews, but this is a product I am VERY familiar with. I'm looking again, but think I will look elsewhere this time."
4,Very nice product,I purchased this product to help drown out some noise from the next room. It works great. I also love that it was very in expensive.
2,"Like it a lot, but it shorts out","Similar to what others have posted, we really like this sound machine. It's inexpensive and the waterfall noise is the white noise that we use, which is great for our baby/toddler. The ONLY problem we have with it, and it's a pretty big problem, is that the volume knob is a point of weakness in the internal circuitry, and this machine has stopped working all together and gone out intermittently. I've actually taken it apart twice to tighten things up in there, which has worked, but only for a few weeks or a month. Disappointing since we otherwise really like it, but it ends up being worse than nothing if the sounds goes off and comes back on while our daughter is sleeping, which makes us very frustrated!!"
4,White Noise Machine,"Very helpful machine to use while sleeping with a snoring person! I own an older model and the volume goes louder. Wish this one was a little louder. It also has other sound settings. Can run on batteries also, but I've not tried that."
3,"Great sound making machine, when its on","Living in a condo, and being able to hear my upstairs neighbor snoring, we had to buy something to drown out the noise.We bought this exact model at a local store, and it has a tendency to stop if you push the knob a little too hard. However, for the price, we bought a backup from Amazon to take on our cruise, and as a backup for whenever our first one finally dies."
3,Sweet dreams,"I could hear my downstairs neighbors listening to the TV when I went to bed and it prevented me from falling asleep every night. I bought this thinking it was a noise canceller, which it wasn't. However, the birds setting is so soothing that it calms me down and helps me fall asleep quickly. I haven't had a problem falling asleep ever since!"
3,Helpful sounds,"I bought this Sound Spa so that I could have some ambient noise at night to mask my tinnitus as when it's completely silent, my head noise seems louder.I find that out of the several nature sounds, the only one that I enjoy is the rainstorm. The other sounds are just annoying.If you have tinnitus, this is a good device for the money. You can set the time anywhere from 15 minutes to non stop, so I have it on all night since I tend to wake up often.I would recommend this product."
2,Purchased 2 in 2 weeks--same problem,"The first one I bought worked fine for a week, then the sounds became distorted and had static. Returned that one and got another one and the static seemed worse--especially at the higher volume. I still use it for my son's room but I am getting ready to buy another product because I can't take the static too much longer. We did travel with it for 3 days and it worked well because of its size."
4,It helps to relieve stress,It helps to relieve stress and get better to study and get good grades and succeed in school.
1,short short sound,We bought two and both cut client in the middle of the night and take wiggling to even stay on for an extended period of time.I actually wake up due to the sudden silence.
4,use it nightly,"I mostly use rain or waterfall, waterfall is more like white noise. I wish this unit had babbling brook and wind through the pines. I don't like the ones with chirping birds and sea gulls."
1,Three strikes..... your out!,"I have given this product an honest try. Each unit lasted only a month or two before shorting out. I was able to return them to Amazon for a replacement each time, but after returning 3 different units with the same issue, I am moving on to another product. I like the volume of this product, it is a nice size, but in the end, it has to work more than a month or two or it's not worth it!"
4,Helps with sleep,"I live on a busy street and was having trouble sleeping; I sleep very soundly with this on. I never take this off the ""waterfall"" sound, which is essentially white noise.The only things that detract from it being 5 stars are: A) it would be better to have an on-off switch instead of a volume to turn it on and off, so I can be sure to have it on the same volume every night and B) they should add a pink noise option."
2,Great while it works,"I love this little sound machine and so do my kids. Unfortunately after only 2 months of use, we are having problems with it. We have been through about 3 machines."
4,Love it!,The best toy our office has had in a long time! Lots of settings. Heart beat is kinda creepy. Doesn't block all noise.
2,stopped working after 1 year,We bought this when our baby was born and have used it every night for a year...until it stopped working
2,Broke after 1 year of limited use.,"We've had this sound machine a little over a year but rarely used it for our toddler until we had our son 2 months ago. We would put it on for her before bed. The sounds of the machine are fine, but ours is shorting out and won't stay on most of the time anymore. I'd spend a little more on a more reliable one."
1,Cheap Junk,"This is a cheap piece of junk. It came with some kind of short in it that makes it periodically stop making noise, which wakes our baby. It requires a smack to resume making sound. Also, the noise itself is a cheap kind of static that is less soothing than haunting. It has what sounds like subliminal voices and moaning embedded in the sound. I am shopping for a replacement today. Avoid."
1,Doesn't work properly,"Specifically ordered this for the heartbeat noise for young baby to learn to sleep alone. It arrived and the heartbeat sound doesn't work. Returning for replacement, but what a hassle."
1,TOO MANY LIGHTS,"I have had this unit for 3 months. When plugged into the wall outlet, the unit has a 60hz hum along with the selected sound...irritating!I typically use it as a portable unit on batteries. However, because of the 2 LED lights that shine brightly and disturb my trying to get to sleep, (I have a serious case of ""screaming"" tinnitus) the battery runs down fast.The design is bad. It should have 4 timer buttons (stop, 30 min, 60 min and continuous, each would turn on the sound for a designated time with no lights except for continuous when the unit is probably plugged in."
1,Doesn't always turn on - low quality,"This is the worst sound machine. It doesn't always come on when I turn the switch, it just sits there like nothing has happened. Sometimes when I turn it on the volume is cranked all the way up and I have to turn it off and back on again to get a normal volume level. The sounds are ok when it works, but I would not recommend this to anyone."
4,Thumbs up HoMedics,"You know the term ""you get what you pay for""? I feel like I got more than what I paid for. Considering white noise/sound machines are usually very expensive, this inexpensive HoMedics sound machine is well worth the price.My only complaint is that ""waterfall"" sounds remarkably like just plain white noise."
3,Love the concept,"I like the sounds and the small size of this machine, but it needs a few tweaks here and there. It makes a strange noise (like a short) Seems to have something to do with the volume knob. In the timer mode, it should turn off automatically. (after the time elapses) Over all, I enjoy it, but will wait for a more updated model."
1,"Spend more, get something you can count on.","Started to work off and on about six months after purchasing it for our newborn son. Would cut out from time to time. Now, none of the lights work, and the sound is almost non-existent. Pay more for a better product, this is just a waste."
1,Doesn't last,"I bought one of these less than a year ago. It worked fine for about 8 months, but no longer plays throughthe night, just turns off when it feels like it."
3,"It's ok, sort of.","I bought this as a gift, tested it out first- Thank goodness. I like the rain and ocean sounds especially. My only issues were that it did not come with a thunderstorm option. My main issue was that there was a buzzing sound when set low volume, it would get drowned out if you put it higher but if that's the case, it would be far too loud to use at bedtime. On that same note the volume is really great quality, it goes pretty loud.It has a timer but also comes with the option to play continuously. It's a nice little machine if you like nothing more than the few decent sounds. If there was no other option I would have kept it but I sent it back due to the buzzing, may be defective.Overall, I'd recommend it, despite the buzzing, it's a nice little inexpensive sound machine to have."
4,good to sleep by,I love this little sound machine. I am particularly fond of the rainstorm...it sounds very real....and I turn it up loud if there are other sounds I want to drown out. I sleep through the night...I use it when I am visiting other people and it really works.
2,Stopped Working,"Noise machine stopped working within 6 months. Worked great at first, then just stopped. If i stick a little nail in the knob then it works, we'll see how long that lasts. Poor quality."
1,Poor Quality - Won't Last Long,"The only reason I give this 1 star is because it is okay when it works. However, sound quality is poor. We are about to lose our second model in the last 5 months. And let me tell you how much of a pain it is to lose your sound machine when your crying baby needs it to help sooth him/her. For just a little bit more money you can get a sound machine that will last years (like my first child's sound machine). I would not recommend this product for anyone who plans on using it for more than 2 months! TERRIBLE"
3,"Great noise effects, but it has a glitch.","We are on our fourth Homedics noise machine. Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment. We have one in each of our kids' rooms, and they provide excellent noise to drown out the house noise, and the noise choices are wonderful. It's also easy to operate, but both of our initial models failed, and in the exact same way. The knob ""shorts out"" eventually and the noise cuts out and goes on and off sporadically. One shorted out after about a year of use, and the other after about six months."
5,Great Little Sleep Sound Machine,"Bought this for $19.99 at amazon.com. A great value. The 120V plug-in power adapter is included. It is fairly small, and it works perfectly, with no problems whatsoever. One of the sounds it makes is a ""white noise"", which helps us sleep, as it covers any distracting sounds that can keep you awake at night. I would recommend this highly. No need to buy an expensive sound machine...this one is just fine. Hope this helps!"
2,"It works, but not for long!","We've been using these machines for about a year and we are now ready for our third, and hopefully last, machine. We've been using it for our 17 month old and he loves it. As soon as I turn it on, he starts sucking his fingers and gets himself ready to sleep. Yes, you can hear where the sound repeats, it is actually a pretty short snippet that repeats over and over but that doesn't bother my 17 month old. The biggest problem is that the machine constantly shorts out or something. It will be on one minute and off the next. We live across from a school so it frustrates me when it stops working during his nap right around the time that school gets out. We've already been through 2 of these and I'm on Amazon looking for a new, different white noise machine now. I'm hoping that he'll adjust to a new machine since he's so used to this one but I refuse to buy another since they just keep breaking."
5,my baby's the Happiest!!,"we read the book ""Happiest Baby on the Block"" it advises a white noise while baby is sleeping. I highly recomend this player.. we have tried other's but this one is by far the best we leave it going the whole night up at 1/2 the full volume. It's been a life saver, our baby is now 5 months old and has been sleeping 8+ hours at night sence she was 1.5 months old. The moniter picks up the sounds of the ocean for us, it's nice. :)"
1,100% Terrible,"My wife and I bought this noise maker shortly after we were married. It worked alright for a few weeks, and then the sound started to die without warning, and with no change in the power/controls. We tried to live with it, but it just continued to get worse. We then returned it to where we bought it (BB&B;) and they very nicely replaced it for us. TRY NUMBER TWO! The same thing happened after about a month. Another trip again to the nice people of BB&B; and a third... Same result. At this point we have it in our baby's room to help him sleep with house noise, but instead he just wakes up when it dies out. VERY angering.So this product is a definite NO. It is cheaply made and will die on you without any reason and without abuse being suffered to the unit."
2,The volume thing really is an issue.,"This product is nice for the fact that our daughter enjoys it. It took about two weeks for the volume nob to go haywire. When you barely turn it on it is SO loud it makes her and I both jump which doesn't help when we are trying to get her down for a nap. Then when you put it on mid level volume it seems to level out. Makes no since, not very satisfied."
2,Cheap materials,"I have two of these Homedics sound machines. While I like the variety of sounds and the reasonable price, they aren't built to last long. On both machines, the sound started to cut out as I moved the volume control knob up or down about 12-18 months after I bought them. I usually have to push the knob in one direction to get the sound to stay on.When the sound machines completely stop working, I'll look for another brand to replace them with."
2,"OK, but developed a short","This is perfect for my needs - something to drown out noise in my baby's bedroom. But we've only had it about a month and it seems to have developed a short in the on/off knob. If you don't press in down while turning it will randomly turn off - not a good thing for a toddler (he usually wakes up screaming when that happens). I know it is 'cheap' compared to other noise makers, but for $20 I would expect it to last a little longer than it has!"
2,Good if you like strange noises,It makes strange noises that are mixed in with the sounds that it's supposed to make. I can't describe the noises and they are different almost every night. They keep me awake and sometimes are even a little scary. Get a better quality machine.
2,"fine, while it works","I have purchased 2 of these, and both are now broke. The product was fine for the money, but you could hear a click when the sound would repeat. Plus, it didn't last long."
2,"cheaply made, short shelf life","I loved this machine until it started shorting out to the point where i couldn't use it anymore. I would fiddle with it every which way to get it to work but after doing this for a few months, it finally died. I only had it for about a year. It's too bad because it's a nice size and it's not ugly like many other sound machines. I saw another poster had the same issue so this wasn't a one-time problem."
2,Distracting repetitive noise loops,"The repetitive noise loops can be very distracting to some. My husband requires a sound machine to block out noise during the day since he works 12 hr night shifts. We only use the ""rain"", or maybe its called ""showers"" option since its the closest to white noise. While trying to fall asleep, you're able to pick up on the continuous clicks and sound repeats and I have found myself staying awake many nights due to focusing on the distraction. Otherwise, my children do not seem to notice when they use it at times."
1,Quality quickly declined starting at 6 months,"We have had this sound machine for two years. After about 6 months it started to have issues, and they have only gotten worse over time. It seems like there may be a wiring issue-- sometimes we have to turn the knob up really high before the sound will come on, and then readjust. Other times the sound comes out sounding static-y.It does have some nice features, like the option to use batteries or plug in to the wall, and the timer options. But after two years of only moderate use it is pretty much worthless. We will not be buying it again, especially for $20."
2,The dial goes bad after a few months,"I would not waste my money on these again- they will go bad within a few months! I've now owned two of these, purchasing one for each of my children. The first dial on the first one (on/off and volume) went bad after a couple months, and the volume control was shorting out. We threw that one away. The second one had the same thing happen to it, within a few months later."
2,Great machine for the first couple months,"My wife and I first started using this to drown out the general noise in our apartment. It worked great!! So well that when is started ""shorting out"", we didn't even notice we were fiddling with it every night. After about eight months, it just stopped working completely and nothing we did could turn the machine on. We ended up buying a replacement and even a second one for our daughter's room. Even after we bought our house, we still used both machines every night. Unfortunately, they both have started shorting out and are getting harder and harder to get working. For as much as I like the product, I'm faced with either replacing both units or replacing them with something else. I can't justify spending money on something that is only going to last a year at best.I would recommend this product if you were looking for something that will do the job, but only needed it for a couple months. Beyond that, you may or may not be able to get it to work longer."
2,Good but only lasts a short time,We ordered two of these to use for our baby to help him sleep and distract him from loud noises outside (we live in the city). The first one was great and convenient since we were able to travel with it and pack it away when we were taking a trip. But after about 3 months it started to short out so we ordered another one. The new one has started to short out after only a month which is frustrating. I wont be ordering this model again but it was good for the price.
1,Great at first... until it stops working :(,"We adored this thing! For the first month we had it, it worked beautifully. I don't know what happened to it - it just stopped working. A complete waste of money. It worked fine so I got rid of all of our receipts, so I'm guessing this is not returnable at this point. Look elsewhere... I'm back to sleeping with the fan on at night for some white noise... in winter."
3,Pretty good but quality could be better,"We bought this for our son but after about a year, it started shorting in and out. The quality could be better. We use the ""waterfall"" setting for white noise which worked great for a while. Now, it's hit or miss if it even goes on loud enough or it will be too loud. It shorts in and out. We are having to get a new one now. Affordable price but if you want it long term, I would recommend a different brand."
3,2 machines shorted out,"Really liked the idea & the price, but 2 machines (had returned one) have had issues shorting out. I gave it a 3 only because I loved it the months that it did work."
2,"Cheap price, cheap product",I bought this from amazon in Dec. 2010 and used it maybe 6 times until it broke in May 2011. It just mysteriously stopped working. Amazon will not let me return it anymore and Homedics is demanding that I send it back to them by UPS Ground (which costs 10 of the 17 bucks I paid.) I wish I had just put the money towards a nicer one.
4,It does short out sometimes.,"I agree with some other posters who said it shorts out from time to time. The knob can be sensitive. But, for the price and portability I can deal with it!"
3,Doesn't last very long - multiple units tried,"We love the rain noise off this machine, but unfortunately with use every night, you should only expect about a year of use max before the on-off/volume switch starts to go... if you can tolerate this, you'll get a couple months more out of it. We've had at least 3 units (thankfully not too expensive to replace) in the last 5 years, and each unit has behaved this way."
2,"Poor Quality, Good Sounds",I have used this machine for my son's sleep the last 4 years and I really like the rain sound. However the machine only works for about a year before the power/volume dial becomes finnicky and breaks. The last machine I purchased broke after 2 weeks. I am looking for a different brand to purchase.
1,A LITTLE ANNOYING,"THE SOUNDS ARE MORE NOISY THEN SOOTHING. I BOUGHT THE SOUND MACHINE BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO WEAR THE MOTOR ON MY DESKTOP FAN OUT, WHICH HAD MORE OF A RELAXING SOUND THEN ANY OF THE 6 ON THIS DEAL. I COULDN'T GIVE IT A ZERO BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE SIZE AND PORTABILITY WAS AWESOME, BUT THE SOUNDS ARE TOO GENERIC AND ANNOYING."
4,"Is good, but volume button is messed up.","I own THREE of these machines because it's great in my kids' rooms. However, the volume button on all three is somehow messed up. I have to wiggle it just right or push it down to get it to turn on. Sometimes it even goes off and on by itself. That being said, it keeps the kids sleeping so go ahead and buy it!"
2,made not to last,I bought one of those and it was great for about a year(all the sounds are good)but then it started malfunctioning.(sound breaks off or stops completely).We thought it was because of our son(it was in his room).Bought another one a few months later for our room -and ten months later it's doing the same thing!!Like there's a timer to self-destruct.[...]..Frustrating.I guess it's exactly one of those things that are made to break.
5,great noise maker,Every new mom or someone who travels a lot needs one of these. This is my fourth white noise maker and it is my favorite so far. The volume go high enough to block out the outside noise. There is a variety of sounds and it comes with a adaptor. Great product!
2,ditto on shorting out,"Pretty disappointed that just after a year's use, the volume started jumping all the time. Same thing other buyers have reported. I ordered a 2nd thinking the problem would've been fixed. Same problem. Thank goodness for Visa's warranty extension."
4,It works as advertised,I bought this for white noise because I live on a very busy street. I love all the water sounds and it has been on almost 24/7 since I bought it. I like having volume control and 6 choices for differing natural sounds. I recommend this for anyone who needs to fall asleep relaxed. I use it during meditation and anytime I want a sound other then the street noises to reach my consciousness. This is well worth the small price.
3,"Sound cuts out, but easy fix/workaround","If you buy this, know that the sound WILL eventually cut out on you (I own 3 and it has happened to all of them). The culprit is the electrical connection made by the power/volume knob. At first, you might be able to get away with simply blowing into the space around that power/volume knob, but you'll eventually need to get a little more creative. Take a folded piece of paper (business card works well) and insert it into the gap around that knob to serve as a brace/collar between that knob and the casing. If you position it well, you'll see the power light steadily illuminated and the sound won't cut out.Note that I still rated this as a 3, because that workaround is very easy and the device still provides decent value at this low price point."
1,Was great for a few months......AWFUL quality.,"At first the sound machine was GREAT.BUT, after a short time ALL THREE of ours stopped working properly.They are poorly made - the sound completely cuts out sometimes.......usually just when our baby is about to fall asleep. ha ha.Sometimes the volume goes super loud and sometimes you can barely hear it - and it changes without even touching the dial! Not very soothing.AWFUL! Will never buy this brand again."
4,Good Product,I bought this sound machine for my grandson. He has one at his house and sleeps really well. He takes really good naps since I've been using this at my house. I highly recommend it.
2,It is a crap shoot...,We got 2 of these for my children. The one we got from my son from 2 1/2 years ago still works. We have had to replace my daughter's twice and will no longer be using this one. The sound cuts out and is difficult to turn it on. It was like trying to tune a radio station.Love the battery back up but it is unreliable. I would not get this one again
1,Garbage! Don't waste your money!,"I stupidly bought this TWICE. The other reviews about the ""shorting out"" problem is accurate. Both of my units had this issue after a few months. I also bought a THIRD one for a friend and now I look like a cheapskate. Thanks!"
4,HoMedics Sound Machine,"It really is nice! It puts me to sleep, i use the rain sound or the ocean one.I was always listening to the radio at night and it kept me up thinking of what they were saying or the music it was playing. Now i turn on the Sound Machine and it's like my body knows time to rest & sleep! Just wish it had more relaxing sounds!"
5,Perfect to drown out adult noises for baby's room,"We have this one and a much larger version, and this one is much better. I like the waterfall sound the best as it's the most like simple white noise where you don't really notice that it's on yet it blocks out other sounds."
4,Great product,I bought this for my mom. She has terminal cancer and it it so soothing for her. Gets her mind in a better place. Thanks!
5,Works wonderfully!,"We needed a sound machine that did not turn off for an all night play, and this is one of the few that does not turn off. The sounds are all true, none of them is distorted or weird sounding like some. It is very light and portable and can come with us when we travel."
2,"ISN""T RELIABLE!","I have 2 of these and have had trouble with both. When I turn it on, it sounds like it's shorting out and doesn't stay on unless I monkey with the knob. Also, I've had one switch to another sound all by itself - from white noise to birds chirping. Very annoying. I wouldn't buy another one."
4,Son loves it,"Bought this 2 years ago for my son to help him sleep. He loves it, we love it. The only downfall is that yes, it does short out sometimes.. Always has, but only when I first turn it on and ONLY sometimes, you just have to hit it lightly and it gets right back on track.. not a huge problem for me and I wouldn't trade it for anything. Nice that it has different options and volume control. Would recommend."
1,Amazon sells Homedics junk,"Received this first week of May- 2012. Worked fine for about a week. Now it turns on- but no sounds. Not with battery use or plugged in. UNFORTUNATELY, I was trusting and did not keep the packaging which is REQUIRED for a return!! Expected the cheap thing to work for at least 90 days- stupid me!! diane in Pa"
1,Already Broken,"I bought this in January. It worked ok, nothing special. And now its broken. It didnt last even a full 5 months. Really disappointed!"
3,"Good, but....","We've been using this sound machine for our kids for the past 3 years... My only complaint is that after about 3-6 months, it begins to short out. You have to mess with the noise dial to get it to work, but the noise will start and stop. Since these are relatively cheap, we just get a new one. BUT - wanted to point this out since it has happened to three of the machines now."
2,Does not last,"This product only worked for about 6 months. I went and bought an identical one and it lasted only 5 months. I liked that you could travel with it using the batteries but it is not made well enough to travel. It always stops working. I've had another machine for 3 years and traveled a lot, it's still going strong. I suggest another product"
1,homedics sound spa relaxation machine,"very disappointed in this product. although the recordings are good (ocean waves, waterfall, rain, etc.) the volume knob (which is also the on/off knob) went on the fritz on day 2. at first it needed a jiggle to get it working. now, it sometimes works, often not. I discovered that sticking a q-tip into the space around the knob helps to keep the machine on! poor, poor quality. do not waste your money. if using this to help your baby to sleep, a loud fan works just as well."
5,My children sleep better,"While we use the Sharper Image sound soother, this is a perfect solution for a children's bedroom. The boys sleep better and fall asleep easier. It's a brilliant investment in better rest for parents. Tough, well-built, highly recommend the waterfall type sounds as they seem to work best. Priced right for places where a bit of children's wildness may require ordering another, but thus far it seems quite durable and I am very pleased."
2,STOPPED WORKING,"I had this less than 7 months and at just 6 months the sound did not come on at all. Then it started up again somewhat, but with no volume at all. Being HoMedics I expected a whole lot more than what was delivered! Very disappointed in this product. I could not send back because it was longer than 30 days from delivery and no longer covered by the warranty.I would not use the word HATE in my preferred dictionary of words for the rating, but it does really warrant it."
4,Does a good job,I bought this for my three-year-old daughter. I wanted a simple sound machine that would provide some noise to drown out other noises during nap time. It suits the purpose. I find that I only use the white noise mode. Any other noise seems too annoying by which to fall asleep.
2,Works great...for a while.,"I have owned 6 of these in the last 4 years, since my daughter was born. They work fine for about a year, but over time the on/off volume knob becomes loose and the machine starts shorting out. With the birth of my son a year after my daughter we began using one for him as well. Right on queue (a few weeks before both birthdays) the machine started acting up today. Last year I replaced my sons with the clock version of this machine. Since the on/off on that machine is a button, I have had no issues with it. I plan to replace my daughters with the same unit.If you want a machine for only one year, buy this one. If you want a longer lasting machine, upgrade to the clock version."
2,"Nice Sounds, Low Quality","I have used white noise generators for many years. I wanted a light-weight battery operated one for foreign travel and camping where electrical power is not readily available. For this purpose the unit works moderately well. The only useful sound for me is the waterfalls sound. This is the only frequency that will partially drown out low frequency sounds like snoring. Other sounds are cute but not too useful and, in fact, distracting.I have found the same defect as other reviewers. The on/off/volume switch is of poor quality. It malfunctioned early on. The unit will still work but one has to ""exercise"" the knob to get it to work. Sometimes the unit simply shuts off by itself in the middle of the night. Hometics needs to spend more then $0.25 on the switch."
5,like a lot,"Great product for the price. Not super loud, but fine for most situations. Works great w/ batteries too & is designed to make it easy to pack for trips."
2,sound soother,"Sound is tinny, and ocean sound doesn't work at all, Not worth the postage to send it back. Would not recommend it."
2,Not sure.,I'm just not sure this is worth it.I ordered 2 of these and 1 works just fine but the other 1 has so much static when turned on that you can barely hear the sounds... Like the one that works though..
2,not reliable,"I've bought this product twice - and both times it broke within a couple of months. We used it in our son's room, so it did get daily consistent usage... but I still wouldn't have expected it to stop working so quickly."
5,Must-have item,"Great product, great sound, light, the renditions of each ""nature's state"" have a pure sound. I don't have a favorite, my child sleeps well with either one of them. I bought the other version of the product with image projection thinking to keep one and return the other. I ended up keeping them both: one I keep in the crib and the other one in whatever woom my child wants to take a nap. The images are cute, with the sun smiling and the octapod of the sea is simply adorable! I recommend both products!"
2,"Good sound quality, annoying seagulls","We purchased this item for our guest room which is regularly used by friends who live in the Caribbean and sleep to waves crashing near their house. They don't sleep well if there's not that background sound so we thought it would be a nice addition to the room, however, the screeching seagulls ruin the peaceful sounds of the crashing surf. While the sound quality is good, I would not recommend this to anyone wanting only surf sounds."
2,lasted less than a year,"I bought this to use in my baby's room while she slept. The sounds on it are good and it has a decent volume range. However it started shorting out within six months. I was able to get a few extra months out of it by tweeking the volume dial every time I turned it on, but eventually it became more of a hassle than it was worth. Not a good value for the money."
2,Sound repeats way to fast,"The ""cycle time"" for the tracks is way to short, I could easily pick up the patterns for every one. The waterfall took me two nights, that was the hardest. I don't like the repeating. I don't want to think about it. I want it to just be ""random"". So this is useless to me.I'm not sure why I'm even giving it 2 stars. It does ""work"" in that it makes sound and is easy to control.If you're ok with the repeating, go for it. But I definitely recommend buying this in a store if you can so you can easily return it."
1,TOTAL JUNK!,"I have purchased one of these, and my sister 2, and ALL THREE have crapped out within a couple of months. ""Shorting out"" like someone in another review wrote. I have to bang on mine with my fist to get it to come back on, and it has just gone silent on several occasions, thus waking up the baby!!!! KEEP SHOPPING!"
2,Switch broke in less than a month,"I bought this for my baby son's room. I was basically looking for something that made basic white noise akin to a fan but without making it cold in his room. The waterfall setting did the trick. You can hear the loop, but that didn't matter for my purposes. I liked that it got pretty loud when you turned it all the way up and that you had the option of using batteries or a plug. The problem is that the on/off and volume nob broke after LESS THAN A MONTH!! This is VERY poorly made. I should have known better given that I had years ago purchased a similar HoMedics Sound Spa and it too broke very quickly."
3,good deal,"I use the Waterfall setting every night. It has what I guess you would call an oscillation to the sound, which might bother some people. But I have enjoyed it. It does run on batteries or plugs in. It does not have a headphone jack, which could be handy if you are in a room will other people who might not want your white noise. Overall it seems like a bargain."
1,low quality,"After buying 2 of these over the past few years, I'm about to invest in a real sound machine."
1,Great **when it works** but broken after less than 6 months!,"I am NOT impressed with the quality of this machine. After less than 6 months it is turning off intermittently for no apparent reason--it's not the cord coming out, it's not our electricity.It's unpredictable when it will turn off and has ruined more than one nap for my twins by turning off just at a crucial time. Driving me crazy and I am so annoyed at the quality. DO NOT BUY. Get another brand--the idea is great but the quality of this machine is just horrible."
1,Worst machine I've ever had to deal with,"This is one of the biggest pieces of junk. Worked fine for a couple of months, then would start randomly cutting out. I'm someone that's grown up with sound machines helping get to sleep and stay asleep, so I've gotten to the point that if everything goes quiet in my room I will immediately wake up. This machine has cut out more and more over the last year and now I can't even get it to connect to the power cord anymore so I have to keep batteries in it at all times. I'll turn it on and turn the knob for the volume, something that should be a relatively easy task, and it will cut in and out, in and out. And a lot of the time it won't even come on at all, even if I've just replaced the batteries. It's awful. Spend some more money on a machine that actually works. You'll be glad you did."
4,White noise machine,"This little machine has surely made our night's sleep more restful. The rain is especially soothing, but with any of the sound choices, ensure that the volume level is just right. My only minor complaint would be the static sound in the background. Overall, this is a great product."
1,horrible,"We have gone through two of this sound machine in the last 7 months. Both have stopped working within a couple of months. At first we had to fiddle with the dial to get them to work, but they would shut off at different volumes, and finally they both just died. They aren't expensive, but it's such a waste of plastic and other materials to have such a short lifespan on this product. This time we're going to buy something more expensive and hope it lasts longer. We're using it for our baby, so it's pretty frustrating when it won't work."
2,Ditto on the bad volume knob,"Like all the others, it was great until the volume knob shorted out. Same story ... you have to wiggle it to get it to work. Not sure how long this will even work."
2,"Nice thought, but no staying power.","I bought one of these to drown out my husband's sleep apnea breathing machine. It has 6 different sounds to choose from. I prefer the rainforest or summer night setting. The ocean and waterfall made me want to run to the bathroom too many times during the night, and the heartbeat was downright scary sounding. The reason I gave this item only 2 stars is that, after 3 months, it started malfunctioning. The transformer cord keeps coming loose, so that the machine quits. I had also purchased one of these units for my neighbor, who works nights and sleeps during the day. She said her unit was doing the same thing. So it must be a manufacturing fault. Anyway, I would not recommend this unit if you want a long-term noise solution."
1,Do not buy this brand!,"We are on our second one of these sound machines, wrongly thinking that the first one we had was just a defective model. However, the new one is doing the exact same thing. After using it for a month or so, they both began to ""short out"" on us. My baby would be napping and it would just shut off and come back on, which wakes him up every single time. So frustrating!! And now when we go to turn it on, we have to bang on it four or five times to get it to stay on. Not a very effective way to keep your sleeping baby asleep in your arms! We are online looking for a new one, and will NEVER recommend this one to a friend."
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought this because of all the good reviews but it didn't do the job for me. Relaxing sounds, yes but helping as a sleep aid, not so much. Now it's just collecting dust in storage..sorry..I didn't like this product very much."
2,Keeps me up,"On the Rain setting I heard regular, hard popping sounds, and on the Waterfall setting, I kept hearing a high loopy whine. Not conducive to sleep, obviously. If you just need something loud and white noisy, this would be fine, but I'm looking for something that relaxes me, not something that keeps me up."
2,Should have listened.,"The other reviews are right, this sound machine works great for a while (about 6 months) and then just stops. The parts are cheap (which is why it's ultra affordable) and the knob is faulty. After fighting with it every night for several months (wiggling the knob...) it has completely stopped working. Time to look for a better machine!"
2,Shorted out after not long,"Pros:- Good selection of sounds- Nice volume control, can get pretty loud if needed- Battery option- Shut off timer, a nice function if you don't need to leave it on all nightCons:- Unreliable quality. I have friends with the same unit, and their's works fine. My unit shorted out after about a month. I figured out how to rig it to work with tape and rubber bands, but that doesn't always work.It's probably not worth the money, especially with the alternatives out there with more favorable reviews"
4,Volume is perfect,"I'm sure volume is a personal preference, but I'm shocked by the reviews that say this sound machine is ""too quiet."" If you turned it up much louder you would wake someone up! Yes, it's cheap and the sound quality isn't perfect, but if you're looking for a small, inexpensive sound machine to mask noises and lull you to sleep, this is a good choice. It's also the perfect size for travel. I debated on buying it due to reviews about volume and the fact that it has no ""white noise"" setting, but I found the volume issue to be untrue and the ""waterfall"" setting is pretty close to white noise. You get what you pay for! Perhaps the volume issue has to do with a defective machine because it does sound like people have had problems with them. So far so good for me. Get it at your local Wal-mart so you can return it with ease if you're worried about problems."
1,There are better sound machines,"We already owned a different HoMedics sound machine and it's far better than this one. The volume control doesn't work well at all on this machine; either far too low or way too loud and there was lots of static, no matter where we used the machine. The product seemed very flimsy as well. We ended up returning it and will spend more for a better machine."
5,Soothing sleep~,"The ""rain"" selection is probably the only button we use, but it is effective enough to put our 1 year old to sleep any time of the day. My wife is quite sensitive to bumps and creaks so we worried about how she would be able to sleep with the artifical noise. However, she fell right asleep next to the baby in a few minutes. Highly recommended."
2,"Bought several, all of them stopped working","I bought two for my house and two for gifts for two other new moms. Both of mine stopped working (sound just cut off, if you tapped on it it would come back on, but got worse and worse). I DO love this sound machine, so affordable and just twist the volume up and you're set! Other sound machines are not loud enough and require tapping of the volume button each time you turn it on (for up and down volume), such as the DEX brand one you see at Babies R Us. It is a great price and a great machine, but now I am on my third and it just broke, too. 60$ later.... I am finally getting around to writing my review."
1,It's Junk,"We have gone through two of these in 5 months. A nanny recommended a sound machine for our baby. It is great at getting him to sleep, but this model stopped working. At first it would just magically stop working. I would wiggle the cord and it would turn back on. After awhile it stopped working altogether. We bought a second one (same model because it's the only one we could find in a store) and it did the same thing. We have switched to the Conair version (bought on Amazon.com) and it has not given us any problems."
5,Great product,"We use this for our baby's room and is a must have for new parents, as it provides them with various options for soothing noise. Different volume adjustments and accurate sounds. Just bought for a friend expecting their first baby and know they'll love it. Reasonable price, good quality."
3,"Okay, noise machine","The product is a good size and shape for everyday use in a room, however there isn't a real ""white noise"" setting. The closest one is waterfall... would have liked more sound options. But it works okay."
1,Buy MARPAC SOUND SCREEN 980A instead!,"Not worth $19.88! Cheaply made, ""tinny"" sounding. I bought this to help my 3-month old fall/stay asleep. We live in the lower unit of an older duplex (all wood floors), so it can be quite loud. I also bought Marpac's Sound Screen for us (I am a light sleeper) and like it much much better. It is twice the price- but why spend $19.88 on something that is poorly made and doesn't perform? I am sending the HoMedics machine back and ordering another Marpac Sound Screen.Buy this instead!Marpac Sound Screen 980A Electro-Mechanical Sound Conditioner"
3,Tape Loop Poorly Designed,"I owned the previous model of this sound spa and expected it to be even better. I was instead VERY disappointed with the Ocean sound selection. The tape loop is so short (maybe 15 seconds) that it becomes irritating to listen to because your mind will hear the pattern of the sea gulls sounds repeating instead of the ocean waves. The previous model only had the wave sounds, so it worked great. I'm using Rain sound and it's OK."
2,The volume is too low,"This machine has a couple of neat sounds but the volume is very low and even when you turn it all the way to maximum it is not loud machine - this is a noise machine! The machine is also very flimsy and doesn't make me feel confident that this is a good quality machine.I ended up returning it and go back on the market for a good noise machine (Homedics used to have a good one, but it's no long available - it has been replaced with this new one definitely not as good)"
1,Sound cuts out/switches to other sounds,"We bought this soundspa and the other version with a projector (DON'T BUY EITHER!) for our 5 month old son. We wanted something that would stay on all night (We have a cloud b travel giraffe we were previously using but it turns off after 45 min. and our son won't sleep without background noises on). It worked great for about a week to two weeks, and today it is now switching from ""Ocean"" to ""Rain"" on it's own, and also now is cutting out and the sound get's very choppy when it does play. If you switch it back to ""Ocean"" or any other sound, it always switches back to ""Rain."" Extremely disappointed in this companies products-this is two products now that both have failed to work correctly. If it worked properly, this product would have served our needs perfectly, as it had for the last one-two weeks."
3,The volume knob shorts out,"We've purchased two of these because we left the first one at a hotel we were staying at. That said, both of ours had the same problem--a short in the volume knob. We've now had our second one for a few years, and while it still works (and we use it daily), it is extremely frustrating because of the effort required to set the volume to the level you want. And SOMETIMES, when you set it to a volume you want, the short causes it to change volume (drastically) suddenly and wake your sleeping baby. Not cool. We've since purchased the Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System--essentially the same price, has additional light features, and works perfectly. Highly recommend the Munchkin product over this one."
3,"Great idea, not great quality","I love the idea behind this, it is a basic white nosie maker to drown out noise for our daughter to sleep, even camping since it runs on a couple of batteries! But after only a month....it started shorting out...we can still coerce it to work..but I know we eventually won;t be able to. Bummer!"
3,Volume knobs are faulty,"When we received our first item, the volume knob was ""crackly"" and you had to jiggle it to get it to work. We sent it back to Amazon and received a replacement. The replacement worked fine for about 6 months, and started to have the same problem. This problem doesn't kill the machine, you can use Radio Shack's Tuner Lubricant to spray the contacts and get it to work again. The quality of the potentiometer is quite low, however, and if you don't want to have to do maintenance, I'd suggest looking around for another machine."
1,Breaks within a month--I've been through 2,"I bought one of these and it worked amazing...for about 3 weeks. Then when i rotate the knob it gets staticy, and then eventually after about another weeks use it barely works and only at certain volumes. I returned the product, purchased another of the same model, hoping it was just perhaps the one that I got. Unfortunately I was wrong. After 3 weeks of the new one, the same thing happened. I would not recommend purchasing this product at all."
4,Sounds great drowns out our loud neighbors,Just what I needed to distract my mind from the voices of our stupid neighbors at 2 AM!
2,It will break...but works well while you have it.,"I've purchased two of these machines, and both eventually broke. It was great to have for traveling, but after having only used it a few times it started cutting out, then stopped working all together. It doesn't last long enough to bother with if you're going to be using a sound machine on a regular basis."
5,Helps my tinnitus,I bought 2 of these. I'm a side sleeper so one goes under my pillow and the other on my nightstand so both ears are exposed to the sound. I focus on the sounds coming from the sound machine and less on the ringing in my ears. Now I can finally get some sleep - what a relief. It's a great inexpensive sleep aid.
5,Love this Noise Machine!,"Bought two for each of our kid's bedrooms to help drown out sounds and keep them sleeping. They work great... have lots of different choices (including just white noise-what we were originally looking for) and you can adjust the volume. We keep them plugged in all night but it does have timer settings. Took them traveling over Thanksgiving and it was comforting and reduced the new sounds. Highly recommend, especially for the price!"
2,"Could be a fluke, but . . .","I like the variety of sounds (jungle, waterfall, rain, ocean, etc.), and after a few weeks I became somewhat dependent on my little sound machine. Then I went overseas and took it with me. As soon as I plugged it in, it died, never to work again. Sad! It always felt lightweight and cheap, but I guess I'll never know if I killed it with foreign electricity, or if it bailed in my time of need. Disappointed, either way."
1,Doesn't Last,"My infant daughter sleeps with a sound machine. This one seemed very nice at first, but after about 4 months it quit working - the sounds would randomly come on and off. I thought we must have just gotten a bad machine and bought another just like the first...Here we are a few more months down the road and this one is going out too. Looks like a nice little machine, but the quality isn't there. I won't buy another."
3,"Good, but could be better",I really would like this alot better if there were more options to listen to. Some of them would be really relaxing if not for the annoying chirp or drip or some other sound in the backround. Only one of all the choices helps and I can only listen for the shortest 15 minute time. Sound is pretty good though.
3,"Very compact, but ""low"" volume is not low!","I purchased this for my daughter, as her very old one finally gave out. We both loved the fact that it was so compact, so it stores away nicely, but the low volume is actually quite loud. She likes a sound machine on a very low volume setting, so she didn't like the fact that this one didn't allow her to do so. She ended up having to muffle it by throwing a towel over it so it wouldn't be so loud, and that has worked for her.The sound quality is very good, and you can play this sound machine continually (all night like my daughter likes to), or you can put it on 3 different timer settings. I would only recommend this product to someone if they're willing to put up with the rather loud, ""low"" volume setting."
4,Great but not perfect; not build to last.,"I absolutely love this sound machine; it's a MUST for a baby/child's room. My whole family falls asleep to the rain sound. I just ordered a third machine as a back-up because both of my machines have problems shorting out. I would give this product 5 stars if I didn't have to keep buying them, but at under $20, it's really not bad."
4,Totally worth the purchase.,"Honestly, I think this product is just fine. Hard to believe I could not find one at Sharper Image or Brookstone so I was forced to use Amazon. Not complaining since amazon seems to have everything. This thing is much better than the counterpart which has the alarm clock. The display was so bright it would not allow the room to go dark. This one serves the purpose of some soothing sounds and I am very satisfied with purchase. I have only had it a week so if anything goes wrong I will update. As far as I'm concerned, I gave it only four stars because there are minor ways it could be better, but still one of the best out there!"
3,goes off on its own sometimes,"I got this sound maker at Walmart July 2010. It worked great at first. Then started going off on me after a few months. I would have to sneek back in my son's room and turn it back on while he slept. Yes, I'm sure I did not have it on the timed setting. I really only use 2-3 of the noises b/c some of the others (like the heartbeat and bird one) just are constant noises so my son doesn't do as good with them. I really like the rain one. Wish they had a thunderstorm, though. I use this at every nap time and every night and I would buy it again."
2,"Been through 2, don't last long","I have purchased two of these now. The first one starting shorting out after 6 months. I have to adjust the volume slowly to get it to almost ""tune in."" I chalked it up to a bad model, so I bought another. The second started doing the exact same thing after a month. It is a pain. I am going to find a better model this time."
3,limited life,Nice unit for the price but I am now buying my third one after two have broken within a year. It could be that allowing the batteries to run low and die in the devicefries the electronics if they can't deal with a slow steady voltage drop that eventually goes below a useable level. An automatic shut off (for low voltage) would beideal but for $20 you can't have it all. Replace batteries regularly or keep it plugged in and it might last longer.
1,don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money. It never worked correctly. I have another Homedics sound machine that I've used for years with no problems, so it must just be this model."
2,died after 2 months,Friend bought it for me for my daughter. Worked great for almost 2 months and now wont turn on. Seems to be a somewhat consistent complaint. Looking for a different brand
3,Nice sounds,I live in a very quiet country home. I sleep much better when there is some kind of noise. My husband enjoys the crickets. Good value for the money.
2,Great when it works as it should,"We have owned 2 of these--the cord attachment gives out around 8-9 months of use. With batteries, the machine works well for another 4-5 months then starts to go down hill. We tried to have a new one sent as it was still under warranty and the company was not responsive!"
5,Our third one - because we LOVE it!,"We keep leaving these at motels accidentally. Ooops! We always order a new one to replace it! We have been using these for travel white noise for 7 years and two years ago started using it at night instead of our fan. It has a great white noise setting. :-) We plug it in at home but use batteries when travelling and the battery use is so minimal that we easily got through a 12 night camping trip, 10 hour a night use, and did not need to replace them! Wow! We are super happy! Great machine! Nice looking, too."
2,Okay sound machine... used for baby,"I purchased this sound machine for my daughter (2 months old) to block out noise. It worked pretty well... for about 2 months. I used it for about 4 hours a day but after a couple months it started going out. It would work when turned on but then when I went back in the room it would be off. I was afraid of waking my daughter (she was very colicky so sleep was GOOD!) while trying to fix it I would just let it go. Then I would go back into the room when my daughter awoke and it would be on again.Because of the low price, I ended up purchasing a second one of these even with the issues with the first. The same thing happened to the second product. I would not buy it again."
2,Shorts out eventually,"We bought this sound machine for use while our baby is sleeping since we have a small place. The sounds were fine and it worked great for about 6 months, after which the sound would work on and off. After 7 months it seems to not work at all. Seems like something related to the knob has disconnected as the light sometimes comes in briefly when I turn the knob slowly, but I can't get the sound to stay on by itself any longer."
3,Seahore sound kept me awake because seagulls are too loud.,I love to sleep with the sound of the seashore...but this machine kept me awake because the seagulls are too loud and sound very shrill. I took it back and bought Homedics SS 3000 Sound Spa Lullaby...with it's seashore sound (seagulls are barely heard in the distance) I literally sleep like a baby!!!It also has 3 interchangeable discs that shine images on the ceiling or tilt it toward the wall. Great nightlight if you need it or you can turn it off.
2,Poor Quality,"We enjoyed this for a few months before the sound started cutting in and out, which obviously defeats the purpose of the machine. The sound would just shut off in the middle of the night, which woke us up, then it would wake us up again when it turned back on. We finally just threw it in the trash and are springing for a more expensive model. Disappointed in the quality of this machine."
5,HoMedics review,"Very good product for the price. Use it in my sons' room to help him sleep. Had other products like this; this one offers less choices, but with an autistic child, it's actually better than most"
3,High quality...not all sounds are great.,"My husband ordered this sound machine for me to balance the sonic boom alarm clock that he bought for himself. There are six sounds I believe...the volume and timer are worth the purchase. It has three settings, 15, 30, and 60 minutes. I like three of the sounds, the rainfall, the summer nights, and the rainforest. My husband cannot sleep to the rainforest because it has birds chirping like it is morning and that could be a problem for some. The heartbeat sound is downright creepy. The only benefit of that will be if we have another child and use this in his or her bassinet after they are born. The waterfall just sounds like white noise. Altogether this is a nice quality machine it is lacking some sort music along with the noise, that would have been a nice touch."
1,Only last one year,"I have had two of these and they work great for about a year and then start shorting out. I liked them for the first year, but now I'm back to buy a replacement and I won't be getting this one."
2,poor quality,stopped working less than one year after i got it and homedics would not even send a reply to emails. the sound would go out whenever you turned it up above 2/3 volume. in addition to that anythimg less than 2/3 volume is way to quiet.
2,"Works good for the first week, but then goes quiet",We bought this to keep our puppy calm while in her kennel at night. It only stayed loud for about a week. Then it got really quiet. It hasn't been banged around or anything. Just stays in the same spot. A major disappointment. But it did work great for that first week!
1,dont buy this,"this sleep machine is no good. it cuts out randomly, and i have to twist the volume nob to get it to come back on. also this sound machine uses sound files that play on a loop. sounds like no biggie but when i am trying to sleep, i can hear the ""loop"" as the sound file restarts. it is quite irritating when i am trying to sleep. do not buy this sound machine. pay a little more and get one that works properly."
3,Not a bad machine for the price,"We've had this machine for about 2 years. It is not bad for the price and does the job. We sleep to the rain sound. It helps to block out other sound (snoring husband). I keep it on my bedside table. It is not the best quality sound but it works well enough until I research more higher end models. I really can't sleep without it on. It has really helped us sleep better but again, don't expect crystal clear sound. It is a good machine so far for the price point.Update - after a few years the volume knob starts to malfunction and the sound cuts off. You have to jiggle the knob to get the sound to work again. I would not purchase another one but it worked for a few years and was inexpensive."
3,not for true insomniacs,"good:lightweight, so easily portableeasy to usecontinuous play or timer optionbad:5 out of 6 of the noises were too disruptive (the only one similar to white noise is the waterfall)these are prerecorded sounds and the loop is incredibly short (even on the waterfall)- this drove me CRAZYi wound up putting this in my toddler's room. i put the waterfall option on continuous at night and during naps for her. it blocks out the background noise like my other baby crying. she seems to sleep better.i bought the marpac sleep conditioner for myself. it generates white noise so there is no looping. it is great. i highly recommend that if you truly have trouble sleeping. it is worth the extra money."
1,Don't buy this junk!,"Someone gave us this as a gift, and in only a couple of months the sound started cutting in and out. It is so annoying to have it doing this just as your're starting to drift off to sleep. Worse than nothing at all! So I finally trashed it and bought aMarpac SleepMate 980A Electro-Mechanical Sound Conditionerinstead. It has been totally reliable and worth every penny."
1,IT is going to short out..... just wait!!,"For everyone that has written a good review. I would agree, until 6 months or so (maybe shorter) has passed. Then it will short out, it will work periodically, but it turns itself off and on. I have an index card stuck in mine right now to keep it on. The white noise is fine, if only it would stay on. Save some money and download a 99cent white noise file from Amazon Music. Then play it on repeat on your old CD player - this has worked much better and it saves you 19.00!"
2,Great product while it lasts,"We love the sounds as they are pretty realistic and not annoying like some are. But we have only had it about 6 months and the knob is shorting out. We have to wiggle the knob quite a bit just to get it to stay on now, and even then it still shuts off randomly. We have some friends who have the same one and have already gone through 2 of them in the last year for the same problem. We will be purchasing a different sound machine that will last.Update 9/14/11-We kept this machine even though it finally quit on us after about 7 months of use, and my husband decided to try and fix it. If you know how to saulder then it's actually an easy fix. The manufacturing is poor on the wiring of the knob, but if you take it apart and saulder the disconnected wires back together you have a machine that works great and doesn't short out anymore! I still give the product a 2 star b/c it's just poor manufacturing."
2,"Liked it a lot, until is stopped working right!","I bought this for my little guy who seemed to wake up to little noises. It worked great for a couple months, we traveled with it and liked the choices of sounds. Then it started to switch to the default sound in the middle of the night (we like the rain or ocean sounds). Now when you try to turn up or down the sound at all, it switches to the default sound as well. It kinda has a mind of it's own. I would return it to the company (I only have had it for 4 months), but it's going to cost at least $10 to ship to them and they want $5 handling. That's almost what it's worth."
2,reliability an issue,"This is a fine sound machine. it offers multiple options, from rain to waves. It works well and is unobtrusive. Reliability is an issue, however. After a little more than 1 year of use at night, the knob that turns the unit on and controls the volume has shorted out, causing the machine to cut on an off unpredictibly. This defeats the whole purpose, as when it cuts off then comes back on, the sudden noise wakes my children up.Anyway, it worked fine for a little more than 1 year, then wore out. If you need a short term solution, this would be fine. If you want something more reliable, spend your money on something else."
1,"Bad knob, all same volume","After loving my two Conair noise machines (both have lasted over five years!), I had to settle on buying this one for my third child. Worst mistake ever. Returned two to the store after the knob broke within a week on both of them. Now I have one that the knob is broke again AND the volume is shot. No matter where I set it, it is all the same volume: very loud. Very disappointing, stay away and get the Conair instead."
2,Returned,"I am returning this. I will pay a little more for something a little better. There was some distracting ""white noise"" that could be heard with any of the sounds or even when the volume was all the way down. Also it seems like most of the sounds are about 10 second clips. Not so bad with Rain forest, waterfall and heartbeat, but the other sounds have distinctive parts that you find yourself hearing over and over, not relaxing at all. I rechecked the write up on this and it says nothing about it being used or refurbished, but mine was obviously opened and repacked. That may explain the white noise, but the repeating clips is enough reason to find something a little better IMO."
2,sound spa,Product faled to operate after four momths. On off switch does not activate the sound. need to return it. Very disappointed
3,Good while it lasts,"I've had this item for about a year now. I purchased it at a walmart as a cheap solution to my dogs adjusting to the noise that comes with apartment life. I leave it on while I'm away during the day and sometimes at night in order to cancel out some of the noise of people passing by outside and in adjacent apartments. It works well and has a good volume range, but after my constant use of it for about 6 months, it began to cut out and be a bit finicky when turning up the volume. Now, you have to turn the volume level up to a certain spot before it works consistantly. When turning the volume knob, it cuts out and in until you hit just the right spot. It's a cheap option for occasional use and has nice noises, but if you use it frequently as I do, you may want to go with a more expensive model or replace it about once a year or so."
4,Loved it at first until volume began to short out,"I purchased this from a local bed and bath store and loved the sleek, small appearance of it. It blends in nicely sitting on top of my white dresser. It has one of the best rain sounds of all the sound machines out there, and has an easy to use design. Recently, like other posters have mentioned, the volume has begun to crack in and out when I twist the dial to adjust it. It seems to be either too quiet or too loud and cracks out on the in between levels. Other than that, it is wonderfully relaxing! I just hope it doesnt completely short out."
4,white noise machine,Item has several sound choices and adequate volume control. A relative boughtthe same product and is satisfied with quality which is the reason I purchasedthe same.
1,Loud Static Generator,"This machine has a bad habit of making random and really (and I mean REALLY) loud static beeps that can jar you awake. It is incredibly annoying and disturbing. Mine is going into the garbage. I will not give it to Goodwill to annoy another unsuspecting buyer. FWIW, this is the 2nd DIFFERENT Homedics model I have tried that had the same problem. There is information on the internet about this issue. Wish I had searched earlier."
2,great sounds - poorly made,"I bought this at a big box store on clearance before our baby was born. When she was a few months old we decided it was time we needed to start using it - she was just a light sleeper. The thing sounds great - when it works. From the start it has had a problem with shorting out. I love the sounds and honestly am a little addicted to the ocean... just get past the seagull. We have been searching for another sound machine, but in the mean time have found that by putting a C clamp on the machine's speaker and occasionally dropping or banging it to make it work - it does an ok job - about 50% of the time I will find that it is not on in the morning when left on continuous play and the volume knob can be a bit jenky. I was hoping it was just my clearance machine... after other amazon reviews.. I stand corrected.. back to screen browsing for me."
3,Medium,The sound on one of the three I bought wouldn't adjust. It's a little to loud for us. The other two worked but the sound wasn't as clear as I would like.
1,Not Worth the Money,"I bought this sound machine because it was only $19.99. Well, it is not worth it. Unlike one of the reviewers, it is loud (so hers must have had additional problems), but it kept shorting out after a couple of months. My daughter will wake up if it turns off, so we would have to run into her room to move the volume knob until it comes back on. So now I am looking for a new one. I have used it for 16 months, and it just keeps getting worse and worse. Time for a new one!"
1,waste of money,"This is a waste of money. You only get 6 songs and it breaks so easily. It's better to either buy a relaxing CD or download a ton of relaxing songs, put them on an ipod/mp3 player and hook it up to a small speaker to play repetitiously.I suggest Celtic Twilight, Vol. 4: Celtic Planet. Excellent CD."
1,Worked well for a while...,I got this machine a couple of years ago for my twins' room. For the first few months it worked rather well and I was happy with it. Then one day I noticed the light was on but there was no sound. I had to keep jiggling the on/off/volume control switch to get anything. Now it's junk.
1,This thing stinks,"I bought this last week, so excited to have something steadier than a fan that hummed and buzzed and such. Not so. My husband and I both noticed that the loop is about 10 seconds long. The rain was nice, but then there's several close drops that create a repetitive and annoying beat. Trying the waterfall sound? That was almost good, and then as my husband was humming to my daughter to get her to go back to sleep and took a short break, I heard a woman's voice humming almost the same tune! Took me a while to realize that there's a strange humming sound that repeats as well. NOT GOOD FOR LIGHT SLEEPERS."
1,Returning it today!,"Just received this yesterday and I am returning it today. Used it last night. The repeating sound loop can be distracting, as you wait for it over and over again. It actually kept me awake for quite a while. I personally feel it's not loud enough either. After reading the reviews about the poor quality of the electronics, I don't want to keep it long enough to have it break down."
1,wisper machine??,"We were looking for a machine that would drown out noise while our baby sleeps...well, this machine does NOT get loud AT ALL!! Plus as we turn up the volume it cuts in and out of the little sound that it is making."
5,Great for white noise,"We were given this item when we had our first child. He is now 4 years old and we have been using it for our 1 year old. We keep it in his room and use it twice a day for naps and during the night. He sleeps much better (and longer!). Our first one just broke and we ordered our second one because we like it so much. I like that you can plug it in or use batteries. You can keep it on or use the automatic off button (turns off after 15 min, 30 min, or 1 hour). The crickets and heartbeat sounds kind of annoy me, but I like the waterfall, rain, and ocean. The rain forest is okay. I'd definitely recommend this item."
2,Great when it was working...,"We ordered this for our new baby in August and have been using it every night since - we haven't used the battery option, just the plug in. Suddenly, today (December 31st) it stopped working. While it worked like a charm when it was working (you have the option to have it run without the timer, which is nice because when others had stopped, she would wake up!) I am disappointed to have it only work for a few months..."
3,could be better,this has a short in it and it randomly shuts off & turns back on AND the volume gets stuck on loud!
3,"First one was great, the second one does not work (static and sound goes in and out unless the volume is up all the way).","We had one of these for our first child. It worked great. It's small and you can put batteries in it for travel. We purchased a second one for our next baby and it has never worked correctly. In fact, I should have returned it but I'm a lazy shopper. I am going to buy another one but I'm just going to get it at the drug store b/c they are cheaper there than on Amazon by about $8."
4,Helps me sleep,"I was excited at first because I liked all but the white noise sounds. Then i realized how quickly it repeats & there is a background noise all the time. But I gave it a try & it does put me to sleep. When my husband 's snoring wakes me I just turn up the volume & get a good sleep. Overall, the price was great & it would get a 5 but for the repeating & background noise. It has better sounds than a store machine that cost $99.00! Thank you Amazon!"
4,White Noise,"I like the machine - i noticed no looping effect in any of the sound settings. The machine works well and I like it - however the one I bought it for doesn't much care for it - it doesn't hide the hum of the commercial refrigeration units from two blocks away. Seems to be a good unit for the price, however does not fit my needs."
2,"still works, but touchy","We've had our HoMedics sound machine for 3 1/2 years or so. It still works. BUT, since it was a couple of weeks or months old it has been picky. When you turn it on, you have to crank the volume knob up and down until it stops cutting out (after a while you get a feel for what you are listening for - it just sounds normal after enough ups/downs). Then it works for the night or works on the timer to shut off. The kids like the waterfall sound.If you don't crank the volume knob up and down, it randomly cuts out. We've tried having it on different surfaces and banging it, both of which offer some sort of placebo effect but never really solve the problem.So, if you buy one, be ready to have to work with it over the long term to keep it going. It isn't particularly hard to crank a knob a few times when you turn it on. I hate it, but somehow it doesn't die and the kids like it so we haven't bought a new one."
1,Bad experience,"I actual bought this at Walmart, while on a trip with my 2 year old son. The sound kept turning off. I had to fiddle for a while with the volume knob and the cord to finally get it to stay on through the night. I don't know if it was dropped, although the packaging seemed sturdy, or if it was assembled poorly, but if I had a Walmart near me, I'd return it in a flash."
1,BAD-BAD-BAD! Bought two - BOTH have failed within 2 months!,"One of these machines was in the guestroom of a friend in Atlanta in October. (We're on leave from the UK for 6 months.) It worked great, so I immediately ordered two, one for our bedroom and one for our guestroom.The one in our bedroom failed (began to wake us with loud static noise) after 5 weeks of use. So, I unwrapped the second (new) one, figuring that unit 1 was a fluke. After only FOUR NIGHTS, the second unit began waking us with the same sort of loud static noise, so it was a bigger dud than the first!Now my return window for Amazon.com has expired (on Nov. 29th), so, I'm left with the unlikely possibility of having the manufacturer make its one-year warranty good. So much for yet another ""Made in China"" product.BUYER BEWARE!RevDr. John Wade Long, Jr.Hendersonville, NC"
1,Volume knob broke on 3 of the units we bought,Shame on us for buying 3 of these units. ALL THREE volume knobs shorted out immediately. You have to fiddle with the knob to make the sound work. I've read that in many other reviews. DON'T BUY IT!!!
2,Poor Quality,"The on/off button is very cheap and loose. You have to press down on the button to turn it on and the machine often cuts out and stops working. My son wakes up in the middle night and calls for us because his waterfall noise has stopped. I replaced my original machine with a new one and both machines have this problem. The sounds are great, but the machine is poorly made. I have a Conair SU1W for my daugther's room and it is by far a superior and more sturdy product. Spend the extra $$$ and go with the Conair."
2,breaks after continuous use,My daughter is not quite 4 months and it just broke. It seems to short out often too.
5,Sound Machine,This sound machine is great! I bought two at the same time and haven't had any issues. The selection of sounds are perfect and I think this is better than the brookstone sound machine that is so much more expensive. My husband and I have one for our room as well as our two and a half year old. It is definitely worth it if you're looking for some help with your sleep as well as covering noise for naptime!
3,Works great when it doesn't give out,"This is a great product for the money. We purchased this for my daughters room and it does it's job. Her room is medium size and we keep it across the room from where she sleeps. It is loud enough for our purposes. I dont think it would work as well if you had a larger room and had it across the room.It recently has been acting up though, which is why I gave it three stars. Every now and then it will just stop working (we have it plugged in). We have to jiggle with the cord to get it to go on again and it will stay on. It's just annoying more than anything. AND you cannot beat the price!"
2,Loved it!.......and then it died.,"The sound variety, volume control, the timer, the quality of the sound, etc. are all very good and work very, very well; in fact, this machine initially appeared to be far better than some of the $100 models I had seen in the past. It successfully blocks unwanted noises, without being too obtrusive. Also, I find its design appealing.With this said, unfortunately, the machine broke only after a couple of weeks. It began generating this siren-like noise occasionally, waking us up in the middle of the night. Since it was still under warranty, I had it replaced. The next machine, too, broke in less than a month. This time, it just won't turn on.So, I suppose you get what you pay for. I wish they'd make a more expensive model with the range and quality of features this particular machine offers. It is a good machine, but the reliability is a bit questionable."
3,Good... When it works...,"We've used this product for about 9 months. Overall, it's pretty good. The sound quality isn't fantastic - but hey, it's a noisemaker not an orchestra. We've definately gotten our use out of it, and it's worked great... unitl about a month ago.There's a short circuit in the volume knob that causes the sound to crackle and sometimes cut out completely. You have to play with the control - push it, twist it, shimmy it - to get the sound back on.This sound machine has been pampered. It's sat on a shelf and been turned on every evening, turned off every morning. It's never been dropped or otherwise abused. So, needless to say, we were disappointed to see it cut out after only 8 months. From the other reviews, we're not the only ones with the problem.The reason we gave it 3 stars is because we have used and benefited from this product for a fairly long time - so I can't complain too much for a $20 product.Enjoy!"
1,Too Loud Noise Machine,The volume control on this product does not function properly. I would like to return it but cannot find my paperwork.
3,Great Sound Machine - Engineering Needs to Work on the Knob,"This sound machine is great, perfect for my new born baby and even at two he still asks for it. However, the knob for on/off as well as volume control fails more often than it should. I started using our first machine, a baby shower present from Target, in September 2007 and used it until the fall of 2009. The machine worked fine, but the knob did not - in 2009 it would go on and off all through the time it was used (and sometimes waking my son - ugh). We would hit it to get it to stay on. We finally purchased another one from Amazon in November of 2009. By January 1, 2010 - knob failing. Today, does not work at all. It really seems to be far to delicate. Hence why I only gave a three star rating. I probably will try my luck with another one though, my son likes it so much and I have found nothing equal in size and style. Really wish the mftr. would fix the knob shorting-out issue."
2,KO'ed on quality,"We bought three of these around Christmas time. We gave one to our daughter as a gift, kept one as a back up or for company, and left one at my parent's house for when we were overnight guests there. The sounds are fair, though you can hear the playback as it starts over the cycle again. My issue is with the quality. My daughter used hers for only 4 months before the volume button quit working, and it would randomly change volume in the middle of the night. Luckily we had one in back up. The one we left at my parent's house, though used very infrequently, also had problems and has had to be scrapped due to the volume button, after about a dozen nights of use, it would randomly decide not to work at all. We are still looking for a good quality noise machine, because this one definitely is not it. Paid for 3, and only one is still (Crossing my fingers) working."
4,Great for travel,Price is right. Great for travel. Easy to pack. Battery or plug in. Very convenient.
3,sound machine,"We purchased 3 of these. One was defective the others worked fine. They are simple to use for the children. The heart beat sound is too frightening, it sounds like it is from an Edgar Allen Poe story. The other sounds are fine. They seem fairly durable."
2,Stopped working...during nap time!!!,"This sound machine worked great at first. I like that it was small enough to throw in the diaper bag and take to grandma's house. After about 3 months of daily use, it started to cut on and off randomly. We would have to tap it several times with our hand to get it to stay on. Today it finally gave out entirely (during nap time unfortunately). I have only had this product for 4 months."
3,Great...while it works.,"Louder than other sound machines I have bought, which is nice for blocking out sounds.BUT we have bought 5+ of these, and every single one shorts out in time. Usually around 6 months in, you have to wiggle the volume knob, push on it, etc. to get it to work. It gets harder and harder to get to work, then eventually stops altogether.The last few we bought haven't even lasted that long. Not sure we'll continue to purchase this model."
2,"We own 3, and all of them have shorted out!","When working well, this product is excellent. It is the only affordable sound machine with a white noise function that was loud enough to soothe our colicky baby, and now that he's older, loud enough to block out the noise that would disturb his light sleeping habits. The problem is, it rarely works well! And we have three that all have the same problem! There seems to be a short somewhere behind the knob, and you have to get it in JUST the right place for it to stay on; but it will still frequently cut out. Obviously, this does nothing to aid good sleep, and it's cost my one-year-old multiple afternoon naps by cutting out. VERY frustrating!"
1,returned this item!,"I returned this item because, although it had lots of options and was portable, all the sounds were unnatural and very high frequency!"
4,sound machine,We bought this for our baby (who is soothed by water sounds). It works very well at calming her down and blocking out other household noise.
1,Like the machine. Hate the electronic short.,"We have by this point bought probably over 10 of these machines, and have the same consistent complaint. It inevitably has to be thrown away because it has a short that develops after some time of use. Truth be told, the only reason we keep coming back to this one is because it is easily available at Target, (for the same amount listed here, btw), and my kids sleep very well with them. However, after seeing what else is available online, I refuse to put up with the poor manufacturing anymore. I'm sure the company realizes this problem exists. If so, it's time they address it."
1,I've had three and they all short out!,"I've gone thru three of these, crossing my fingers that I will finally get one that won't short out on me. But, three down and all have shorted out. You can usually eventually get them to work, if you get the button just right. My other complaint is how much room it takes up by laying down. I wish it was upright."
4,Worth the $$$,Neighbor's dog barks all night...this is great at masking the noise with soothing noise so we can get to sleep.
3,it's okay for the money,"Someone bought this for me as a Christmas gift because I said I had wanted one. It is not bad for the money but I am now searching for my next one.Pros: very loud, 6 different sounds to choose from (I love the ocean, waterfall, and summer night!), small and light weight perfect for traveling.Cons: (and most of these are my hang ups I guess) I hate the heartbeat sound, the forest sound sounds more like a hurt bird screeching now and then, (soooo not comforting!), oh and the rain sound is on a 8 second loop and has this strange tick that makes my eye twitch after a while.Once again not bad for the money but I think I can find one I like better!!"
1,Volume control shorts out,"We bought two of these, and both only lasted a week or so before they stopped working properly. The units started making odd noises and the nature sounds shut off and on intermittently, because the volume knobs short out. Instead of helping to soothe our toddler to sleep as we intended, these devices wake him up."
1,Only lasts for a few months,"We've had 5 of these, and all of them have stopped working within a year. In addition, they die a slow death where they kick on and off randomly, or where you have to position the machine just right to keep it working. Incredibly frustrating, and after 5 doing the same thing, I don't think it is just bad luck."
1,Same problem as everyone else.,Volume know started shorting out within a month. After looking at the other bad reviews on Amazon I will certainly just buy another brand as this looks like a super common problem.
2,Quit working,"This worked for a while, but after a year or so, it started cutting in and out, and finally stopped working altogether. Also, there is not a white noise function. You have to put it on waterfall, and that is not entirely great as white noise. I would not spend the money on this again. I would pay a little more and get a better one,"
2,stopped working after a year,"i bought this machine to use every night ,i liked the options,and volume, the sounds were ok, but anyhow after a yr it went dead"
4,Inexpensive and works well,"My husband and I bought a house on a somewhat busy country road- while there are not a lot of cars, when they do go by I find myself waking up a lot (we sleep with windows open -weather permitting). Bought this in an attempt to ""cover"" the noise. Works fairly well, though I can still hear the cars, but I find that with this on, I don't wake up as often. Love the ""summer night"" and ""ocean"" programs.I am considering getting another for my meditation room too. Overall I recommend it as a ""first attempt"" at noise control - rather than jumping to one of the more pricey models."
3,Great start but shorts eventually,"This sound machine is a great little machine...at the start. It has various sound options and my daughter has used it since she was an infant. However, we are on our second one in two years. The machine eventually shorts out and the sound will not play unless you push up and hold the volume knob. I thought it was a fluke on the first machine, but last night our second (replacement) machine died on us. My sister has the same model and the same issue has happened with hers. Frustrating. In all honesty I haven't contacted the vendor to see if they'd replace it, which they might have. But after 3 faulty machines I worry that the replacement will be more of the same."
2,Rain sound too 'drippy' for me,"I bought this for the 'rain' sound, and the sound that came out of the machine did sound like rain, but with an overlying 'drip' that reminded me of a leaky roof. Not relaxing at all. Overall all the sounds on the machine were not real enough to help me sleep. I've no one to blame but myself. You get what you pay for."
2,It's good while it lasts,"I have burned through two of these already. I have a little one and need a sound spa to help block out the background noise during her naps and at bedtime. I use this product on a daily basis once or twice a day. After consistent use, the dial no longer works right. When you turn it on, the sound won't always turn on and you either have to push the dial down slightly (repeatedly until you get it right, it's quite picky on how much force you use and it varies every time) for it to make noise, or turn it completely off and try again. Also, it turns off randomly and again you either have to push the dial down until it decides to play, or turn it completely off and try again. It is a great idea and my daughter loves the sound, can't sleep without it, but it wears out way too fast. Like I said, I have already burned through my second one in less than two years. If you want something that is going to last through constant use, I do not recommend this product."
2,worked then didn't,"It sounds fine for the kids to sleep at first, but after about 6 months the volume switch shorts out, meaning it will cut off at random times (and then the kids sometimes wake up)."
1,Nature sounds????,"What a piece of junk. The ""ocean"" sounds like it was recorded on fast forward. The midsummer selection is like crickets on steroids. It is really that bad."
2,Good read for children,My granddaughters are going to love this book. The pictures were beautiful but the story did jump around a bit. I wish more time had been spent on each animal.
4,Charmed this isn't,"This is a quantom leap forwards from the first YW book. It's evident both the writers and artist have learned from their prior experience.The story takes place straight after the end of book 1 where our heroines are picked up in a coach containing the famous Dr Jeckle This sets the town for the rest of the book with a strong story, driven along alternately by sex and cameos of famous Victorian londoners (Sherlock Holmes, Jack the Ripper, etc).Special praise must be made of the art already the strongest part of the series this looks amazing here especialy as they remember that this is a porn comic and put some sex scenes in there this time .This time it's definately worth a look my only criticism is that a better introduction so that anyone who missed book 1 could pick the story up painlessly would have helped. If you've read book 1 this is a must if you haven't I'd start here and not worry too much at the references you don't get"
5,Not Cheap But Worth Every $,"Tires and Wheels(My wheelbarrow has 2 tires)cost more then I paid for the wheelbarrow, but I don't have to worry about the tires being flat anymore when I go to use the wheelbarrow. Wish I had bought them years ago.These are made in different axle sizes (5/8"" and 3/4"") so make sure your order the correct ones for your axle. These are 5/8"" but Amazon does carry the 3/4""."
1,Don't buy these bowls!,"Well, one might think that a set of KitchenAid stacking mixing bowls would be a very versatile part of one's kitchen. Not so. The sides are flimsy, but okay, you might not find that to be offensive. But they don't even go in the microwave! To make matters worse, KitchenAid does not even put on the bottom of the bowl that you shouldn't use the bowls in the microwave. In fact, the dishwasher is even too hot for them -- they warp. A total waste of money -- don't bother."
2,"Okay, but I've had better","I bought the set of 3 white bowls. I like the sizes and the bottom that sticks to the counter. BUT they stained easily from a variety of foods. And recently, after very light use, the largest bowl got a very big crack from the upper edge down to the middle of the side. I'm really disappointed. (I have an old Rubbermaid mixing bowl, that I've had for decades, that's still going strong.) And I'm very glad that I did NOT give the KitchenAid bowls as a gift!"
1,Disappointed,"Ordered Alfred's Party because my grandson really likes it. We received Alfred's Camera instead. We had ordered this book too, (Alfred's Camera)so now we have 2 copies, and didn't get the book we ordered. We were disappointed, since we really wanted Alfred's Party as a birthday present for our grandson."
5,Engaging and profound music,"I have consistently enjoyed Crumb's music in CD release; I find it haunting and powerful. Having attented live concerts of his music, I would love to have access to releases in DVD-Audio or SACD."
4,Fine & Mellow,"I disagree with Tim & agree with Dave. The title lets you know that it's mellow tunes, not your best all-around compilation, but a fine mix of mellow. And it's true: tracks 8 & 9 kept me from listening often because I like putting a few CD's on 'shuffle/random play', but never could use this CD until I burned it with tracks 8 & 9 normalized, though they are still hurting from some clipping distortion. Also EQ'ed most of the rest as well. Teddy Wilson & Kenny Drew play some nice piano too. Not Ben's best, but quite relaxing to listen to."
3,Not Webster's best effort,A lack luster performance and poor sound quality make this CD a good choice only for the collector who must have all of the BW. The Stormy Weather or Gone with the Wind cds are much better examples of Mr Ben.
1,Weak characters,"From the character development to the actual characters, everyone is lacking. The men are weak, the women are weak, not one character is stands out as a hero."
2,disappointed,"I read this book and can't see why it is so highly praised by Oprah. What disappointed me is that I couldn't really get a mental picture in my head of the things the author was describing, especially the landscape. The plot was very boring, and the characters were not developed well. I think if the story was told from Carl's point of view it would have been a better story."
2,Very disappointed!,"I have read 5 Oprah recommended books and have loved them all except for this one. I guess my expectations were too high, on the back of the book it's catorgorized as a ""psychological thriller"", well I was not thrilled.I will say the story was told very uniquely, by the different characters, but from the beginning, you don't really know HOW it happens, but when you find out, it's not a suprise.All in all, I was disappointed. But it won't stop me from reading other Oprah books!"
1,Not really interesting,The book is mostly cliche. Clearly the author has read Beloved too many times without coming up with many original ideas.
2,WOW!,This book rocked my socks! I loved the way it was written and how it went back in time and then to present. It always kept me guessing. You have got to read this book!!
3,Worth a Read!,Perfect for easy reading on a rainy weekend! The seemingly predictable storyline takes a turn for the more interesting and becomes a suprising page-turner!
4,Suspense Before Mystery,"This book was gripping and I loved reading it. The driving sense of suspense was skillfully executed and the ending highly anticipated. Therein lies its weakness. In the end, I felt teased by the suspense that was seemingly spun by a sinister event and yet was, in essence, the natural consequence of a tragic misfortune. Is it possible the suspense was written before the mystery? It could have been a simple fix made right in just a few pages. No regrets. It was a great read and I look forward to Ms. Schwarz's second."
2,Very disappointing,"I thought this would be much more interesting than it turned out to be. The blurb on the back cover is intriguing, but the actual story is rambling and poorly structured. Though the author tries to set up a 'mystery' ending, it's actually pretty obvious from early in the book what is going to happen. I soon lost interest and started skipping pages to see what happens in the end."
3,Suspenseful and hard to put down!,I thought this book was very well written. The pace of the story gave it a sinister feeling. Very good.
3,Depressing,"I am still trying to remember what exactly it was about.. I had to look it up again to remember and now I know why I quickly forgot it. The book is very well written and the characters are well fleshed out, However the subject is depressing as it is a sad, sad tale of a possessive disturbed woman and the havoc she wreaks around her. The author, however, created an oppressive atmosphere which draws you in and therefore depressed me personally."
3,Okay,This was a read that to me was okay...nothing I would get excited about to recommend to friends. Interesting and somewhat intriguing...but a little loosely written.
2,SOOOO BORING!!!!,"I was on a plane stuck with this book and what a BORE!!! Like many other reviewers I fell for favorable comments (probably from friends and family ) and reading through the chapters was pure torture. You know the ending by the time you read 1/3 of the book and then it just goes downhill¡K though at the beginning the book had a potential to be somewhat interesting. The characters are not fully developed and not well presented. You do not identify with them at all. The language of the book is also very pain and un-engaging. However, if you do not want to take sleeping pills, get the book!"
3,Clearly a first attempt by the author,"I was a little surprised that this book was an Oprah pick. Although I don't usually follow her book club, I imagined it to have more substance. My bookclub chose this book and after some discussion determined that the characters were underdeveloped, the plot was implausible, and the author tried to bring it all in like a B-grade Hollywood ending. A disappointment. Not terrible, but definitely a choice for the library - not a purchase."
3,A good summer read.,"While I found the novel to be a quick and alluring read, at times it felt more ominous than the plot warranted; the foreshadowing was a spoon feeding--perhaps appropriate for today's expectations in literature."
1,WORST CHARACTER EVER,"I just finished reading this book because that is what I do, I start a book and I will finish it, no matter what, but the main character (Amanda) is just too much, I generally don't hate characters in book, even the bad ones, but Amanda was so ""me"", ""me"", ""me"" that I started disliking her immediately, the only person important for her was she, she lied the entire book to protect herself but always thinking that she was doing the noble thing. So stay away from it."
1,never been more disappointed,"I really tried to finish this book so I could write a decent review. I felt as if I should finish it considering I paid money for this book.(Something I wouldn't advise you to do). But why should I finish a book that you already know what happens after this first three chapters?Even though the ending was predictable, I still didnt want to see how or why it ended that way. The book just wasn't very engaging. It seemed to drag on. Schwartz didnt do her homework for this book. There is no mention of anything from this time period. (except maybe a couple of articles of clothing). This book was put together rather poorly. She just didnt seem to master phasing in and out in time.Here is a few words to sum this book up - grim, simple, bleak, and boring."
2,Not so Great,This book started out pretty good and the exceptional detail really gave me an excellent mental image as I was reading. But in the middle it seemed to get bogged down with too much detail and skipping around which made it hard to follow. I found myself skipping whole chapters just to get to the end. If someone gave me the book it would be interesting reading but I wouldn't spend the money if I were doing it over.
3,I've Read Better,"The book has well-developed characters and generally well written.One of the problems I had with the book is that I always knew what was going to happen before it actually happened. There were no surprises.Another problem was that I found Amanda, the main character, to be a rather judgmental, unsympathetic person. Ruth, Amanda's niece, was an oddball as a child and it was interesting to watch her mature after Imogene befriended her. However, at the end of the book her personality seemed to have morphed into that of Amanda.Carl, Ruth's father, was more or less dropped from the story part way through the book. That seemed strange, as he seemed to be a loving person who would want to maintain contact with his daugher.I think this book had an interesting plot, but the editors should have pushed for some revisions."
3,A Family Spider Web,"This story was excellent, although not riveting and not a 'keep you on the edge of your seat' type. However, it's pace rang true with which the time in history in which it took place... the 1920's ish... where no one 'talked' and everything was 'hush hush'.Ruth is an only child whose Mother died when she was three from drowing in the lake where their family home was located. She was raised thereafter by her Aunt Mandy, her Mother's sister, and a woman who is both loving, controlling, disturbed and hiding a deep secret.The beginning of the book made me think, ""why am I reading this""?So the Mom died and the daughter is left to be raised by her aunt... but the story continues and reveals a situation that is probably more common-place than we all realize... that life comes full circle, and that all things are intertwined in an earie sort of way.Well worth reading!"
3,Wasn't too bad,"Set in 1919, Amanda Starkey returns to her home in Milwaukee to escape the problems she encountered in WWI. One year after she returned, her younger sister Mattie mysteriously drowns one night and she is left to take care of her house, child: Ruth, and her husband; who has not yet returned form the war. This tantalizing story gives you an insight into the secrets this family holds. As the text jumps from character to character and from past to the present, we see an overview of each character and how they deal with the problems they are faced with. You won't want to put this book down until you get to the end."
4,Characters Create Suspense in Drowning Ruth,"The opening line of Drowning Ruth, ""Ruth remembered drowning,"" sets a suspensful tone which stays strong throughout the novel. Though the author gives away a little too much about the mystery contained in her plot, she reveals just enough about her characters to keep the reader interested and turning pages. The characters themselves create the suspense as they ""talk"" to the reader through first-person narration; and always, always, they leave the reader with the sense that there is ""something more to know"" about them. Each of the main characters, Amanda, Ruth and Carl, have an air of mystery about them. They hold secrets that compel the reader to keep reading in order to find out what makes these characters tick. Drowning Ruth is a worthwhile read for many reasons, not the least of which is the author's (different) approach to creating suspense, despite the fact that nothing suspenseful is really happening to her characters."
5,Christmas Gift,"I picked this book up at a trade show and let it languish on my bookshelf for two months before I grabbed it to take on my Thanksgiving beach vacation. Boy, am I glad I chose this one! It was a page turner from start to (almost) finish. I've become rather tired of most of the Oprah book selections as they tend to be too broody and self-conscious, but this one was a gem. I can't seem to put it down and I try to sneak time into the day to read some more. This will be one I'll be sad to put down. My mark of an excellent read! Even if I did have to pay for my copy, it would be money well-spent. I plan to pass this along to my girlfriends and buy a few copies as Christams gifts. A great choice for women interested in fiction that explores feminine relationships, mental illness and great mystery."
3,"Holds interest, but lacks sophistication","I looked forward to reading this book - the back jacket was enticing, other reviews were good, and I had enjoyed a series of Anita Shreve books and was looking for a 'new' author. It was interesting, held my interest, kept me curious, but started to disappoint about 1/3 of the way through -- some of the character development was weak, and the story line became forced. Not bad, and a good first effort. Don't pass it by if you're looking for an interesting tale from a new author. Skip it if you insist on an outstanding read."
2,DULL,"This story was incredibly dreary and lonely, and while I am reading many reviews describing Schwarz's characterization as powerful, I can't agree. I didn't care for the characters much, except maybe Ruth, and what I felt for her was mostly pity. I didn't have any feelings or thoughts about this book after finishing it, which is very unusual for me. Specifically, I was chomping at the bit to get into a ""good read"" because this left me rather unfulfilled."
4,Fantastic quick-read!,"Drowning Ruth was a somewhat predictable book, however, a fantastic read nonetheless. I found myself unable to put the book down until it was finished. The storyline is definitely unique as it centers around Amanda who's lifetime of sacrifice, guilt, and shame leads ultimately to a horrific deception that affects the lives of those whom she loves most. As the story evolves it is not difficult to predict the end, however, I was disappointed that one of the seemingly most important characters never reaches a full resolution and is not honored with the truth. This book brings to light at most, just how critical it is to be honest at all costs and how a lie, whether how big or small can absolutely devastate a person. I look forward to future novels by Christina Schwarz."
2,Too Predictable.,"I was thrilled to get this book in the mail, and ended up disappointed. I felt the plot to be mundane and predictable. The writer revealed the story line by telling the story in both current and past frames of references, and in first person from the viewpoint of several characters, much like in The Poisonwood Bible. The Poisonwood succeeded in creating a compelling read. This book did not. There was very little character development. It seemed implausible to me that Carl would search twenty years for evidence that his wife was unfaithful to him, then just say, ""Oh, well. Life goes on..."" within one day of finding this evidence. Other than references to the war times, little of the interactions in the book developed the scene and time frame to an effective agree. I'd skip the book."
4,Exciting New Author,Ms. Schwarz is that fairly rare combination of an author who is both literary and a great story teller. She discloses crucial facts in a release pattern that creates exciting tension and makes it impossible to put down the book once you've started it. I can't wait for her next novel.
3,A Slight Disappointment,"I had high hopes when I started this book. The author combines excellent character development with mysterious atmosphere, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading the first half of the book. However, I was a little let down with the rest of the story. Seemingly integral characters disappear from the story, never to return. You are prevented from knowing other characters as much as you want to. And some characters, so compelling, mysterious, and alive in the beginning of the story, seem to lose those traits and become uninteresting. I don't want to prevent anyone from enjoying this book and forming their own opinions. However, for me, this engaging story unravels with a conclusion that is too neat & does not do justice to the wonderful beginning."
4,Another Great 1 From Oprah!,"I hate reading, but found myself drawn to this one. I love the way it plays out and wow what a surprise!"
4,"""Hypnotic""","I really didn't like this book when I first started reading it, but my thoughts were, I bought it, now I got to read it! When I finished the book, I kept thinking about how keeping secrets effects people. In this book, the life of Amanda was totally different of what it could have been. She has mental problems, mood swings, clings to Ruth way too much. Although i could relate to her as a single mom, I don't think she made many wise decisions in her life. It made my think about my own life and how I do not want to live in bondage from my past mistakes. I found this book hynotizing. I keep thinking about even weeks after I've finshed it. One thing I didn't about it is the way it flashed back and forth from past to present, I could barely keep up. I did think the story was great and thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,A Good Effort that Needs to be Measured on its own Terms,"This is one of those books that often gets panned by those who approach it with unrealistic expectations. While the characters are believable and well-developed, the book is primarily about relationships, not a Pulitzer-level story. However, the writing is beautiful, the plot quite engaging, and the mystery sufficiently plausible to keep you thinking. You'll be wondering about various scenarios for Ruth's drowning well into the book. Aside from the story, the time-setting is most interesting, as is the relationship between the sisters. Once you get into it, you'll have a hard time putting it down."
1,Draging on and on and on and on.,"This book drags on and on and never seems to end. When I finally finished it I felt as though it was a waste of my good time reading it!. I had just read ""Sing Me A Bawdy Song"" and it was one of the best book I have ever read..."
1,Do not waste your time!,"This book whiches back and forth from the past and to the present; the story is told from multiple characters' views and is hard to follow. The story is quite depressing. Don't waste your time or money unless you enjoy reading about ""gloom, doom and dispair""."
4,Interesting characters,The characters in Drowning Ruth are interesting and well developed. The story is interesting as well. I enjoyed the book and thought it was well written. Would recommend it!
2,DRAB READ,"At the start of the novel you get a sense of impending doom, family secrets and interesting characters. The novel doesn't follow through. The story gets bogged down, spanning decades, with the too careful doses of subtly retelling the long ago ""secret"". With such a promising beginning it was a disappointing novel."
3,WOW,"Set in 1919, Amanda Starkey returns to her home in Milwakee, to escape the trouble that she faced in WWI. A year after she returns her younger sister Mattie dies and Amanda is left to take care of her house, child and husband; who has not yet returned from war. This tantalizing story captures you into the secrets this one family holds. You can't help but to read on and find out what really happened. As the text jumps from charater to characture and from the past to the present, it gives you an all- around insight into each of the charcters. This compelling mystery will have you hooked."
4,good book!,I enjoyed reading this book and finding out the secrets. I thought the ending left me a little bit hanging though. I would recommend this book to others.
4,"Debut novel, and she could get better.","First off, I love to read debut novels. While this novel was well written I was left feeling that we didn't need to read the entire novel to wait for the ending. Still, I felt all the emotions in this novel, I enjoyed Ruth, I was angry with Amanda although I understood her. This wasn't one of the best Oprah picks, and if this were out of ten starts I would give it seven. But, I give to many 5 out of 5 stars, and 10 out of 10!"
4,Great thriller!,"I really enjoyed this story. The author pulls you into the lives of Aunt Mandy, you can't help loving and disliking her at the same time. Ruth is the main character, the story takes you through her childhood friendships and her revelation of what happened the night she almost drowned. I could not put it down once I started."
3,One Tight Novel,"Don't get me wrong,I really liked the book. It's just that I only reserve 4 or 5 stars for literary genius. I think Schwartz may someday reach that status, but she still has a little way to go. The biggest criticism I have is that I was not drawn too much into the plot. In fact, it took me two weeks to finish the novel because I never was compelled to pick the book up because I didn't care what happened. But since I always finish a book, I continued with it. The last 100 pages had me hooked. I was amazed by how she pulled the whole thing together. The ending was somewhat predictable, but TIGHT. She began weaving the threads from page one and never left one tie loose, but at the same time she didn't tie them too neatly at the end either. The ending left much to ponder. I would recommend this book to anyone who has patience to get through a slow beginning, the end is worth it and I think Schwarz will most likely produce some terrific work in the future. I'm looking forward to it."
2,Not what I was expecting.,"This book was not what I was expecting. I don't like the way it changes back and forth between the characters,and time lines. It seems really drawn out, and wasn't a book that I just couldn't put down."
4,Great Book Club Selection,"This was one of Oprah's book club choices. It takes place on a lake in Wisconsin between the first and second world wars. Amanda is a nurse who comes back home to help care for her sister, Mathilda, and her daughter, Ruth. Her sister Mathilda is found drowned under the ice of the lake, and Amanda is left to care for her daughter, Ruth, as well as Mathilda's war-injured husband. There is a lot of suspense in the story. It jogs back and forth between Amanda's point of view and Ruth's, while also skipping back and forth from the past to the present time. It is a complex book worthy of book club discussion, although I was not terribly fond of the characters."
3,good day read,"the book was an easy read but a good one. everything connected. from the names to the dates. it flowed wonderfully. the author kept you on the edge of your seat and wanting to know the truth. then i felt that in the end the mystery was solved but it was like an oh, thats all? like it was all building you up for an anti-climax. it seemed that everything that happened just put you right back at the begining again with no real climax. it was a good story though and i would recomend it."
3,seemed predictable,"I agree with ""Shannon""--the main character was flat. I had difficulty caring about her. Sometimes when books have an unreliable narrator, the speaker fails to disclose or even notice his/her motives. It was difficult for me to get past that and not feel like I was being manipulated. The ""twists"" didn't seem like twists to me--the paterinity, the deaths, the flashbacks, etc. Perhaps I watched too many soap operas on TV as a kid. I don't usually read ""mysteries"" but some of the classics such as The Scarlet Letter and Jane Eyre, and modern titles such as The Bean Trees and The Lovely Bones, have more compelling and innovative plotlines."
2,Boring and implausible,At the end of the paperback version that I purchased and read there were comments by the author. Scharz wrote that the plot was the most difficult element for her and so the book had too much plot. I can see why she thought the plot was the most difficult element because I don't think the book had much plot. The associations among the some of the characters and some of the key actions by characters were implausble. The writing was good but the story-telling was cryptic. I'm originally from Wisconsin and I bought the book mostly because the author grew up in Wisc and the story was set in Wisc. Using these criteria to choose a book was a mistake.
2,"It could have, but it didn't","The story could have taken soo many twists and turns to keep it enticing, but it didn't. I kept reading hoping that in the next page it would get me jump started, but it didn't. I thought up of soo many fascinating endings that could have saved the story, but it didn't do that either."
4,A thorough delight!,"I loved this book. I was completely intrigued from page one. I didn't want to put this book down and when I finished reading the last sentence I was somewhat saddened that it was over. This book has it all...suspense, love, murder, scandel...EVERYTHING! I highly recommend it. A forewarning though...the story jumps around a lot. It will read in the present day and suddenly shift to 13 years or so earlier. That is why I gave it just the four stars. Normally when I write a review I talk about aspects of the story. What I liked, didn't like and all the criticisms I had about the author's style. But not this time. You are gonna have to read it yourself. Enjoy!"
2,Ho-hum,"Yet another overrated Oprah's Book Club book. I don't get it. This novel was entertaining enough to keep my attention until the end, but overall I was left to think wonder what all the hype is. There was not one thing surprising or overwhelmingly exciting about the plot. Certain characters' story lines were unceremoniously abandoned midstream to focus on the main characters again. I'll leave a summary of the book to other reviewers. My conclusion, is read it if you want, but I wouldn't recommend it."
2,GREAT BEGINNING BUT THE REST WAS BORING,"This book started off well and I thought that it would have been really good but after the first 3 chapters, I couldn't get into it because the book was disappointing later on, and boring in spots. It was allright but not worth the time to spend reading it. GOT to be A BIG DISSAPOINTMENT."
4,Grabbed me and held me under!,"What an interesting novel. Very well-written, and thought-provoking. Yes, it is a little formulaic, and all the familial connections seem to be a bit overwrought, but I found myself thinking about the characters while working, and I kept coming back to the book. It had a mysterious charm, much like Mathilda's hair waving underwater, that grabbed me and kept me under its spell. The ""secrets"" are perhaps a bit too telegraphed - you could see them coming on the horizon. But there was always just enough of a twist that the resolution was slightly different from what I expected. I have to say that when I saw this was an Oprah book, I reconsidered finishing it. But I did, and that will teach me to be a little more open-minded in the future! All in all, a book full of dark, damp, murky imagery, and thoughtful writing."
4,Lack of communication,"Obviously, if people communicated in this book there wouldn't be a story. But it was so SAD! The story revolves around Ruth, who is raised by her aunt Amanda after Ruth's mother, Mattie, drowns and while Ruth's father, Carl, is off during WWI. While there is dishonesty and deception throughout the book, ""Drowning Ruth"" differs from many modern books in that there is little to no malice involved. The story, with chapter notes by Ruth and Amanda, is incredibly well-told; I would have given it five stars if only it weren't so very sad. There is a lot of conflict and not a whole lot of resolution but then, such is life."
5,A wonderful debut!,"I don't believe I have every read a first novel that has been nearly as impressive as Shwarz's Drowning Ruth. It is a story about love, family, children and making something out of unbearable circumstances. The characters are numerous and well-developed. The story is captivating and suspenseful - the reader only finding out in bits and pieces what has actually happened as Schwarz swiftly switches between the past and the present. I would liken her writing to Anita Shreve if anyone; fun and interesting yet inundated by deep issues of morality, shame and love. Finished easily in a few days, I anxiously await her next work."
4,Good but.............,"I thought this was a pretty good book, esoecially since I read it on spring break and I highly enjoyed sitting on the beach reading it. The story was pretty good the only thing I was disappointed with was the ending, kind of left me with a bunch of questions, it just kind of summerized everything and that was it. But I did enjoy it, it was my first Oprah book club selection and made me want to read more of them."
2,Big disappointment.,I've read ever Oprah pick and was very disappointed in this one. I felt the characters were weak and uninteresting and the plot was too predictable. I didn't feel any of the characters were likeable and was very happy when I finished the book. I'm beginning to get the feeling that Oprah isn't actually reading these before they are recommended!!!!
4,Great story of love and secrets...,"""Drowning Ruth"" really makes you think about how humans react to tragedy and stresses in their lives and the effect their reactions can have on other people. Amanda couldn't have known that her secret would have the outcome that it did, but she had to live with the consequences nonetheless. It really makes you think about the ramifications of the actions you take in your own life.I loved the imagery in this book - you can almost feel the cold, dampness of the Wisconsin farm. Living in the Milwaukee area, I know the kind of winters she describes and can imagine the gray bleakness over the entire story. The water imagery is the other thing that struck me about this story. Water has been long used as a symbol of birth. In this case, it was death that was associated with the water but also a strange kind of birth - the birth of how Amanda and Ruth's lives would be forever changed and played out.It's definitely worth the read!!"
1,I Tried,"This book irritated me on many levels; not that the writing was poor or the plot weak. In fact, the plot, the premise, the writing were good--unfortunately the characters didn't pull it off or keep me interested because they were all kinda indifferent or unlikable.I read somewhere the number one reason people keep reading a work of fiction--regardless of plot--is because they care about someone in the book.In this book, I was hoping they would all drown by the end of the story..."
4,wonderful story!!,Apparently (according to these reviews) you either like this book or you don't. I liked it. I highly recommend it. Great story.
1,hard to get into,One word best describes my experience with this novel...BORING! After taking approximately 100 pages to get into I found it extremely predictable and just downright boring.
5,----- What Secrets We Keep ------,"Loved this book! First off, great book to read in the dead of winter. Curl up & get comfy 'cause it gets your attention.Schwarz switches from the past back to the present a lot, so once you have that down, it's easy to become absorbed within.The characters are so true to form for this near-turn-of-the-century tale that you seem to walk among them! The secrets they hold shed light on what it was like living during that era, especially as a woman. Yet, just the same, it reminded me of the common bonds that all women share. The emotions were shockingly real & raw at times.And please, don't be fooled by that title. I was intrigued by it, but I think some might shy away from it because of the title. This is not some antique horror tale.Take some time to escape with this wonderful author! Her style is creepingly effective throughout! You'll see!!"
3,Drowned but Not Out,Drowning Ruth was somewhat difficult to follow but overall a book that kept me interested and sympathetic to the main character. A great summer read!!
3,What did I miss?,"I can't believe there was so much hype about this book. I was ready to drown myself if this book didn't get to some sort of point. It was well written, but just not very interesting I'm sorry to say..."
4,The futility of trying to keep family secrets secret,"The structure of this novel is what makes it such an interesting read. The perspective is constantly shifting as the narration moves from character to character.Today's younger readers may find it difficult to understand why a pregnancy would cause such shame, and cause a young woman to go to such pains to conceal it, given society's acceptance of such situations nowadays."
1,Borrow from the Library......,"I have bought all of Oprah's book club selections and I honestly have to say that this one was the worst so far. I was so upset that I spent good money on such a pitiful tale. I couldn't even finish it, which is rare for me because I want to get my money's worth out of what I purchase, but honestly, I became so apathetic toward the story that I just couldn't go on. I sure do wish I had borrowed it from my local library instead, then I could have returned it without losing anything but time."
5,Intriging.,Suspensful and what a surprise at the end. Loved the strong female characters. Really held my attention and kept me guessing.
3,a good read,"This is a very unusual book that Christina Schwarz has written. The characters are believale and the situations also. It is the method used to keep information gradually coming to us that makes us want to keep reading to find out just what did happen. Won't tell you what happened, but I did enjoy this book.J. Robert Ewbank author ""Wesley's Wars"" and ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms"""
3,Drowing Ruth Review,"Interesting prose but story was a disappointment. A decent beach read.The description of the bleak setting was quite good, but the author tended to muddle the story towards the finish."
4,A great read with a weak ending,"A great story with a little mystery. The author really lays the scene and then bit by bit slowly reveals how her family came to those events. I really enjoyed reading it. I was disappointed in the conclusion, I was expecting a little more substantial, but I guess that wouldn't make sense. As Mathilda and Amanda lived simple lives, the trials and tribulations are simply a series of accidents. An enjoyable summer read."
2,Talented writer; So-so story!,"Okay, I admit it - I just wasn't crazy about this book. The whole idea of a mentally-ill and controlling aunt (Amanda) ruining the life of her little niece (Ruth) after the girl's mother (Mathilda) mysteriously fell through the ice and drowned one cold winter eve just disturbed me. ...And the ending was even more disappointing, leaving me with a tremendous feeling of hopelessness!This was Ms. Schwarz's first novel, and I did find her to be a talented writer in that her literary style was intriguing. The narrative alternates between the 3rd-person and the 1st-person. The 1st-person segments were from both Ruth and Amanda's perspective and I liked these parts best. It was this style of writing that kept me interested, despite my apathy toward the story. Because of her obvious talent, I would read a second novel by the same author if the story itself interests me."
2,Ultimately a disappointment,"Christina Schwarz is obviously a gifted writer. Her lucid prose delivered the sounds, taste, and smells of that farm on the water right to my senses. Not many writers have that magic touch. Unfortunately, such beautiful writing led to a terribly disappointing and anti-climatic ending. It was almost like the author suddenly realised that she needed to come up with an ending and couldn't quite figure out what to do. Or maybe she just got tired and ""stopped."" The other minor problem was with the throwaway storyline involving Clement Owens. But it is the ending that caused the biggest disappointment in this otherwise lovely book."
5,Surviving Our Choices,"What we say or do not say can have the same results if the truth is not revealed.Appropriately titled""Drowning Ruth"",Christina Schwarz's tale of what is unsaid truly lays bare the story of drowning a soul and spirit by witholding the truth.Amanda the main character is both disturbing and compelling.The truth at the end of the story only reinforces her complexity.This book is a page turner into our own soul,right and wrong choices and the ultimate choice of survival."
3,so confused,"Where to begin, but to say that this book at the beginning captured my full attention. I enjoyed this book, but at the same time was disappointed that the author introduces us to many characters with no real endings. I feel that a lot was wasted in this book and that to much was given away to early in this story. Although I found myself finishing the book only to see if what I figured out during this first parts of the book were true. I admit to tears flowing at times only to be ruined with the annoying re-telling of certain parts. Amanda the most complex of characters is what kept me going, but not only her but all those involved in her life who at the end really didn't go anywhere so you are confused at why they were brought up in the first place, a waste of pages. Though this is her first novel I hope that the author learns from what has been revealed by many readers. The work was good, but it could have been much better, with less disappointment."
2,Well written but depressing as hell.,Read this for a book club. Wish I hadn't. Going back to romances now so I don't have to deal with any more suffering than absolutely required.
4,Kept you reading,"I loved this book! In the beginning it was kind of confusing, but the more I read, the more I liked it. I liked how the author didn't tell you the whole story till the end and kept you guessing. And the truth was so against what I thought would happen. Which I liked.What I didn't like was the ending. It would've been better if everybody found out what happend the night Ruth drowned. Therefore causing even more controversy and plot. I also liked the ending in some respects that it was a settle ending. That no one will know the absolute truth exept for the people that were there.It was an excellent book though and I recommend it to anyone who's interested."
3,found it to be bland,"Usually this style of literature is just my style. I enjoy fiction that is very character driven, that focuses on a small town and the reactions to aa human who is different than the rest of them. But I never felt any empathy with any of the characters in the book. I honestly did not feel anything for them. And I was glad to put the book down so that I could be away from them. But, as a writer, I did find many good things about the pacing of the book, so I kept reading. I have not bought this book for anyone or recommended this book to anyone."
4,Wonderful story-telling,"Amanda, in an unstable state of mind after an unhappy love affair, returned to share her sister Mattie¡s and niece Ruth¡s lives. A tragedy claimed Mattie¡s life. As the story unfolds, the reader finds out what happened before and on the tragic night of Maureen¡s death.The plot is simplicity itself, but what captivated me and kept me turning the pages was the wonderful story-telling style of the author. The story and answer evolved naturally, there was no pretentious attempt to hype up the ending, which made the whole story subtly touching."
3,"Not a bad book, but not a great book either","I found ""Drowning Ruth"" to be just okay. I enjoyed the start of the book more so than the middle to the end. I breezed through the first half and then became bored. I agree it was very predictable. I would have liked more mystery to the story."
3,A weak woman....,"Though this was a good book, (as in entertaining, easy, quick read), I had a hard time ""liking"" the weak woman Amanda. I could not feel much sympathy for her. I realize she was an example of the times and she responded to her situation how probably most women would in 1919, however I wanted her to be more ""likable."" Ruth on the other hand was a strong woman, overcoming obstacles placed in her path resulting from the lies and secrets of her Aunt. I did find myself caught up in the ""mystery"" of the story, and didn't really predict the outcome as early as some other reviewers seem to have. Good book, an entertaining read for a rainy day."
3,Skipped to the end after 100 pages...............,"As soon as the character of Imogene was introduced, the book lost all mystery......I instantly knew who she was and what would inevitably happen in the end. Up until that moment, I'd hoped for more.....I was actually intrigued by the character of Amanda. So.....it was a disappointment. I can't recommend the book."
3,Wisconsin Gothic,"""Drowning Ruth"" is a promising first novel, bound to do well with Oprah's coveted approval. Written in the style of Daphne DuMaurier, with a few well-defined characters, and secrets hidden over long years, this book will keep your interest. The climactic four or five pages at the end are satisfying, and all the plot ends are tied up.For someone who grew up in the lake country, in the midwest as I did, the geographic setting is familiar, and Schwarz does a fine job of depicting Wisconsin land and lakescapes. She also has a master touch in describing women's relationships-- sisters, mothers, daughters, friends. (That is probably why Oprah latched onto the book.) Her touch is less adept at fleshing out the male characters, but she gives it a good try.This is a light, entertaining read although its plotlines are heavily Gothic. You'll easily step into the world of Amanda, Ruth and Mattie, and the events of their circumscribed lives will easily engage you and stir your sympathies."
3,you think you know what's going on........3 1/2 stars,"This is a story of two sisters, and of mothers and daughters. It is a story of ultimate family love, personal secrets and guilt. It pivots around personal secrets that never really vanish and the consequences and guilt that come from trying to keep a secret. One of the things I enjoyed most about this book was that I kept thinking I knew what was going to happen next, or some strange twist I was sure I knew was coming next, there would be a subtle shift and the story would travel down a slightly different path. Sometimes the shifts were more dramatic, but it made me continue to follow the author along the path to see where it ended up. I had strong feelings about several of the characters, especially Amanda and Mathilda, but even those feelings and attitudes changed back and forth through this engaging story. This was an amazingly well crafted first novel."
2,Well-written soap opera,"The writing is good, but the plot seems lifted from daytime TV. The young woman seduced by a philandering older man, the secret birth, the two girls who by wild coincidence become best friends (despite a four-year age difference)and don't realize their true relationship, the brother and sister who almost marry -- really, it got to be too much after a while. The ""revelation"" at the end was a letdown because there had been such a fevered buildup to it that I expected something truly shocking. Overall, disappointing."
5,PAGE TURNER FROM THE VERY START!,This is a GREAT book with lots of plot twists and turns! If you want an easy read that will keep you guessing until the end then this is the book for you! I have three children under the age of seven so my reading time is limited...but this book was definetly a priority! I loved the way that it was told in the first and third person....just goes to show that the same event can often be seen in many different ways! READ THIS BOOK:)
1,A collage of ideas,The book offers some new plot points but they were not fully tied together in way that would be expected in this type of work.
3,"Good, but not great","The story itself is somewhat predictable, but the pacing and writing style is excellent. Enjoyable, thoughtful read."
2,Modern Jane Austin?,"The story reminds me of Jane Austin novels but less interesting. Perhaps that is because the story setting is more modern and closer to home. Regardless of why, the story of affairs, unwed mothers and [illegitimate] children from a woman's point of view is trite. The story of mysterious murder was interesting however. I cant recommend this book."
2,Good read... forgettable plot,"This book was a fun, quick read but a very forgettable one. The story of family intrigue, farm life and WWI America has been told many times in different ways, some which are more effective and impacting. Frankly, I did not find this book to be innovative or unique. It is a great attempt for someone learning how to become a writer. But it dissappoints the well-read person. It would be a good book to read on the beach during summertime but that is all it's worth for."
2,Y did so many people rate this high?,"Save your money. This book is so predicable--literally nothing happens. Read the two, three and one star reviews because they are accurate."
2,What a Depressing Cast of Characters!,"I would not have read this book if it had not been a selection for the book discussion group to which I belong. I would not have finished it if I were not a person who must finish what I begin.It has been a while since I read the book, and I had to look at other reviews to refresh my memory about the book. I did remember the sense of place. The author described places so well that I felt as if I were there.However, I was not able to relate well to any of the characters. I guess I am grateful for that. What a depressing cast of characters!"
2,Overblown,"I just finished Drowning Ruth and I was completly unimpressed. I've been looking forward to reading this novel for awhile. It earned two stars for an interesting beginning and fairly decent writing. The problems with the book are that 1) There is no mystery, you know from the second chapter what occured between Amanda, her sister and Ruth. Consequently you know exactly how the story will unfold; and 2) It's way too overlong. The entire middle 150 pages was repetitve and boring. This novel would have made a wonderful short story, but as a full length book it is unsatisfying. I strongly urge you to pick-up one of the other fabulous books that Oprah has recommended over the last few years."
2,"Predictable, slow moving.","I found this book to be completely predictable. I guessed what was going to happen in the first third of the book. I forced myself to read further hoping for excitement, a twist, something. Unfortunately nothing."
3,Keeps promising and promising . . . but never delivers,"Christina Schwarz is a good writer. I envy her command of the language and her descriptive skill. Unfortunately, this book was derailed by the cumbersome plot, which was complicated by the way the author chose to present it. I have no problem with non-linear plots, as long as the author has the mastery to pull it off . . . you know, like Toni Morrison. I think this novel would have been strengthened had Schwarz not tried so hard to make it seem more complicated then it had to be. I feel she exerted too much effort convoluting the plotline and concentrated more on making the story more potent. I'll leave it at this: the end, when everything is finally explained, is a big disappointment."
5,A very compelling tale,"Drowning Ruth is a beautifully written story, with a plot that will have you on the edge of your seat. The way in which Schwarz unravels her tale could be likened to William Faulkner. Each chapter revealed a new layer in the plot, and I relished every one. I found myself concocting many possibilities for Ruth's drowning; it was only at the end that I could fully comprehend what happened - I can't say that about many books I read. The raw emotion I felt reading the ending of the book therefore felt real, not ""manufactured"" or sentimental."
4,An Entertaining First Novel,"Chosen as an ""Oprah's Book Club"" selection, this well written first book by Christina Schwarz is a mysterious tragedy that slowly reveals itself as the book unfolds.Told in both the first and third person narrative,what happens to Amanda Starkey, her sister Mathilda, and Mathilda's daughter Ruth, become the backbone for a web of secrets that ultimately could ruin all their lives. To tell too much would give away crucial plot points, and considering the ending of the book doesn't come as much of a surprise, the less you know going in the better. I will say the story is rich in atmosphere, with vivid descriptions of the cold Nagawaukee Lake winters. It's also quite a well structured narrative, even if the payoff isn't as satisfying as I would of liked."
2,"Show, don't tell.","I suppose there are Oprah readers and non-Oprah readers. If I had known, in fact, that this was one of Oprah's choices I would probably have avoided it. I'm not sure when a dark and complex plot became enough to recommend a book, but I wish it hadn't happened. DROWNING RUTH gave me no one to love, no one to follow. The point of view changes so often that I lost contact with all the characters. In addition, a number of important plot points are told in narrative, rather than in dramatic scenes. It's frustrating, and it's dull.A far superior novel is Philippa Gregory's 1993 book FALLEN SKIES, set in about the same period. Gregory is masterful in her presentation, and she doesn't tell us anything. According to Hemingway's dictum, she shows it all."
3,It was ok....,"Like I said, it was ok. It was an easy read. Took me several pages to get used to the narration sequences, but it was interesting and the characters were pretty well-developed. The thing is, it felt like I was reading a movie made for Lifetime television in that it was not as deep as I think the author hoped it would be. There was a lack of final climax and the end was a let down. The whole story could've been written in half the amount of pages. Not a bad read, but don't expect anything great."
2,I'm shocked so many people liked this book,"I agree that the writting style was interesting at times (at other times it was downright odd). I agree that the characters weren't the worst I've ever read (they weren't the greatest either, by ANY means! I didn't care if they lived or died).There wasn't one character I could ""root"" for or identify with; even Ruth was annoying at times. The pace of the novel was slooooow; not ""artsy"" slow, not ""I'm making a point"" slow, not ""symbolic"" slow, not even ""setting the mood"" slow.....I think that's what the author was aiming for, but it just didn't do it for me. It was snail-pace slow, end of story.A good first attempt on the author's part; that's never easy. But why Oprah and half the world are raving about it is beyond me!"
2,In the minority,"I wanted to like this book. I love fiction set during this period, and I have an affection for *A Northern Light* (young adult novel also set during this period, which I used as a reading selection for my high school students). This book, however, just seemed ponderous by comparison.The plot moves slowly, and the characters are rather unlikeable. The male characters are under-developed and under-used for the plot. The switching points-of-view don't move smoothly and cause confusion, rather than clarification. Mostly, though, I just found myself skimming (rather than reading) large parts of the text because I was bored and wanted to get to the end.Divergent points of view are difficult to write. If you want a masterful use of this technique,read Faulkner or Shirley Ann Grau's *The Keeper's of the House.* Leave this on the shelf."
4,Drowning Ruth,"Suspense, love, hate all rolled into one. This is a book that is hard to put down. Many twists and turns of emotion. A must read."
1,What a terrible book!!!,"Depressing things happenning to depressing people. Do you want to see the story of a life that is misery after torment after trauma? Do you want characters you cannot like?I cannot imagine any reason to read this book, unless you have had a terrible life, and you want to read a book about someone whose life was worse that yours.I read this book for my book club, and that is the only reason I finished it. I can think of only one book in my entire life that I liked less than this one, but still finished."
1,A Disappointment,"This is, unfortunately, my first review of a book on amazon.com. We have purchased many books and read voraciously. I do not understand the interest in this very obscure, unclear, and uninteresting book. One waits for something to "" happen "", some insight to be seen, which never happens. Who are these people ? What do they have to say ? It is interesting how "" herd-like "" we humans are."
2,Nothing Special,"I once again followed all of the glowing reviews, this book is nothing special. I have been quite bored trying to finish this book, only 30 pages left. The book had great potential in the first half, the characters lost their spark. The author should have detailed more of the era and the hardships. Too bad, had a great start."
3,A merging of Characters,"Not a bad read but I expected more. I enjoyed the characters but the plot was a bit contrived in places. The main character . Mandy, was difficult to like and/or sympathise with and I'd occasionally get her and her niece (Ruth), and the niece's mother, Mathilda, mixed up.this is not so surprising as there were strong similarities between these characters and at times I thought they were supposed to merge together."
4,Terrific!,Great book! Well written. Good use of details to pull the story along. I completely enjoyed it.
2,A surprising disappointment,"I didn't expect to be so terribly disappointed with this book, I purchased it even before Oprah chose it for her book club, based simply on what I read on the front inside cover. One would expect this book to be powerful based on the reviews it's receiving, yet I found it incredibly dreary, slow and uninteresting. I felt no empathy whatsoever for the characters, and getting through this book was basically a chore, but I'm stubborn like that. Needless to say, the glowing reviews and the position on the bestseller list puzzle me. . ."
5,Drowning Ruth,"This is not the kind of book I would normally read. My reading tastes run to mysteries or spy/political thrillers. Someone had suggested ""drowning Ruth"" to me, so I decided to give some time to a new experience. I loved this book. It kept me up for nights on end. The time period and the characters just grew on me. I could hardly wait for the next chapter. When it was over, I wanted to know more... What I found so revealing is the fact that people are more or less the same today as they were years ago. The same fears, the same hopes, the same secrets. I also appreciated that you could use your own brain to fill in the details. No dirty words or explicit sex scenes. I would recommend this book to all age groups. I promise you will love it too."
5,Awesome Book,This is a really well written book. It was such a different story line and I really enjoyed it. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a book with a different perspective.
3,drowning ruth,Mystery that gives hints all the way through it and pulls them all together in the end. could have been better.
1,Books are sacred but I threw this one away.,"I disliked this book so much, I abandoned it at a bus stop in San Francisco. For some reason, reading this book felt like watching a reality tv show, which I hate. I felt it was pandering and ponderous. If it was supposed to be dark comedy, it missed the mark, much like the movies ""Very Bad Things"" and ""American Psycho"" did. I know some people loved those, so perhaps they'll like ""Drowning Ruth""."
1,NOT HAPPY can not get this Ebook in Australia,Come on Publishers allow paying customers to buy ebooks that you publish in Australia. I love Oprah's book club but most of the books i can not get for my Australian Kindle and it it sooooo Not Fair...I'd love to be able to read this book but i can not find this ebook anywhere in Australia for my kindle 3.
1,Hey! I 've read this one before,"I haven't even purchased the book, yet when reading the overly detailed editorial review realized, ""Hey! I read this before."" Only the author was John Lanchester and the title was ""The Debt to Pleasure"". Only the Lanchester book was filled with recipes. (Something useful). I suppose I won't give the Schwartz rendition my time."
1,Relaxed Morals,"Our ""relaxed morals""? Get a life. You mean that we lack the spine and minds of the people of the past who while no more perfect than we are didn't pretend that if they couldn't do it -- or it taxed their guts or minds -- than IT not they must be wrong... correct? Truth is truth and the morals of the past built a great Western Civilization and a great American Republic... so what are WE with our ""relaxed"" morals leaving our children but a global moral garbage pit? Bill Clinton would not have been a distant hope for President if we had been even a decent people -- to bad we weren't. Let's hope that trash like this doesn't get too many suckers. No wonder the CLASSICS are still the CLASSICS. Right? RIGHT."
2,Disappointed,I was hoping for something really intense and to be sincere that wasn't what I got. It didn't take until I got to read half the book before the story really kicked off. It was so boring I lacked interest but I made sure to finish it. The story could have been better and the writer could have put in some more effort. Didn't like it.
3,"engaging read, but weak ending","based on all the reviews i read on 'drowning ruth,' i got it and it didn't take me long to get into the plot - the story is very well written and i thought at first it had a very good pace as well. but somewhere midway through the story i began to get a little impatient with the way we were fed bits and pieces of information of the ending. amanda is clearly unlikable, yet you can't help but feel sorry for her at times. ruth was more interesting, but as she grew up even she began to feel like she was just kind of hanging around. after all the build up i was expecting something much more exciting when we finally learn the whole of the ending, but it became predictable and the ending, i felt, kind of petered out. like i said, it was well written - i just felt it kind of ran out of steam by the end."
4,"delightful, enthralling",Bought this book on a whim to try out my new Kindle Fire. LOVED IT! I finished it in about four hours. Couldn't put it down. My husband is wondering if his parents should have gotten me the Kindle since I've been ignoring him all day :)
3,Good Read But Predictable,I liked this book but wish it wasn't so predictable. I'm glad I read it but it won't be one that stays on my bookshelf to reread.
2,"Difficult to ""wade"" through","Hmmmm, it's surprising to me to read all the other glowing reviews about this book. I'll admit, it catches your attention at the beginning, and keeps you guessing, but the guessing game becomes the central problem with this book, it just goes on and on, and when you finally arrive at the conclusion, you are not at all shocked. The way the author flips back and forth between characters and time frames is at best annoying. Spend your time reading something more fulfilling and exciting and less nerve racking."
3,The plot drowned me in the end,"Because of the book's promise on the cover that Drowning Ruth was a psychological thriller, I expected the ending to be more suspenseful and intriguing. The book drowned my attention in the end, which I found disappointing. I wanted Amanda to live up to my first impression of her, where I thought her capable of murder and wanted to understand her motivations. I resented her being a victim of circumstance."
2,A Disappointment,"After having read several of the books highlighted in ""Oprah's Book Club,"" and enjoying them immensely, I expected to be similarly impressed with ""Drowning Ruth."" I was disappointed. I found the plot tedious, most of the characters shallow and unbelieveable, and the symbolism crude and obvious. I have learned my lesson. Never choose reading material based solely on its inclusion in Oprah's Book Club and the resulting hooplah."
2,Too predictable,"After hearing about Drowning Ruth on the Oprah show, and how much she loved it, I couldn't wait to read it. I finally (after waiting over a week) got to check it out from the library. I've never been so disappointed! It was a very predictable plot and was very hard to follow going back and forth between time periods and from first to third person. It took me the whole three weeks the library gave me to read it all because there were times I found it downright boring - it took about 100 pages to even get into it - but I kept reading, looking for the ""surprises and twists"" in the story... they never happened! Parts of it were ""ok"", but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3,A bit disappointing,"I bought the book because of the back cover description as a suspenseful story of how a woman drowned. While the author did manage to keep me on my toes and interested in what really happened that night, the suspense wasn't worth the revelation that came towards the end of the book. Schwartz is a good story teller but didn't have too much of a story to tell here. Without going into details on the plot and ruining it for people that haven't read it yet, the big family secret turns out to be the most typical type of family secret in existence. There are better books out there to spend your time and money on."
3,Not the best choice of novels,"This book is narrated by two characters: Amanda and Ruth. The story is told from both of their perspectives and jumps back and forth from the past to the present from one paragraph to another. You'd have to be a careful reader to keep up. We ultimately decided that this would not be a best choice book, but we would recommend it to someone who likes to read something different from the norm."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"As an avid reader, perhaps I am getting too picky. Drowning Ruth has a predictable storyline--I once watched a movie with the same 'horrifying' family secret. Schwarz's characters are shallow with a lack of insight and development. I was left wondering where a few of the characters went and why there was no depth to the ones that were left behind. Amanda has no redeeming qualities---her motive to 'do the right thing' was selfish, and ultimately cruel. How is the reader supposed to understand and sympathize with her--even a little? I recommend you read a superior book with 'Ruth' in the title: Jane Hamilton's The Book of Ruth'."
3,3 Stars,"I liked the idea of how everything came together in the story. However, I think the author should have saved more suspense for the end. I thought the author did a good job of introducing us to the characters and making us feel as if we knew them. I did feel like the book dragged on at moments. I think some of the information contained in the book was not relative to the story and it only distracted from the real story line."
4,"Best ""first"" novel since Grisham!","So pleased with the author's first novel....in-depth, thought provoking, endearing. Even though the storyline is disturbing, Ms. Schwartz does a great job writing in a sytle that I've never seen pulled off as masterfully. An excellent Book Club read to stimulate interesting conversation and soul searching concepts."
5,Can't wait for her second novel!,"I just finished Drowning Ruth last night, and I am bereft. I miss all the characters already, and I especially miss the lake--the most inscrutable character of all in this haunting story. Schwarz's writing is pure pleasure to read. Her prose is clean and fluent, and her seamless shifting among narrative voices is the work of a virtuoso. I can't think of a bit of human experience that Drowning Ruth does not explore. We've got passion, betrayal, grief, terror, the joy of romantic love, the strange workings of memory, and more that I can't put words to. In short, it's exactly what a novel is supposed to be. Maybe I'll just settle in and turn back to page one."
2,Good Start.. But tThe Rest Was Bad,"I was very disappointed with this book. There were some good reviews but I found that the story could not deliver.It started off good, a good murder mystery, I was excited to see what would unfold... I kept waiting for the book to get exciting or suspenseful or to get attached to one of the characters but it never happened.The whole book was, to me, a lot of filler and the end was anticlimactic"
2,Don't wait for the movie--it would be a snoozer!,"I dislike giving a bad review to any author but this time, I really cannot say BUY THE BOOK when I don't mean it. It took me forever to read this. There was so much talk throughout the book about Ruth's Drowning (title tells you that this happened) and I kept thinking I may have missed where this story told of it. I thought I slept through it. Not until toward the end do you find out when, why and how it happened. The voice(s) of the story teller were too many. The story jumped all over and was very frustrating to follow. I hope the author's next book is more fulfilling than ""Drowning Ruth"" was. Just please tell your story in one voice instead of several and you may have me hooked."
2,distracting craft problems - I agree,"I wholeheartedly agree with the ""reader from NYC"", although I rate the book higher than one star - mainly because I wanted to know how it ended. The back-and-forth between scenes made for a very confusing read; that style is used in many books, just not used well here, I couldn't start reading again w/out reviewing the last couple of pages. The story itself was interesting, to remember how unaccepting society was of women that would choose a different path. And the characters were developed well. I would give it 2.5 stars."
3,Predictable,"This was hardly the fantastic read I was brought to believe it would be. I thought the entire story was extremely predictable. While I've loved other Oprah selections, such as Poisonwood Bible and White Oleander, this was a disappointment."
2,Okay but slow,"This book describes the guilt and pain of Amanda and how those emotions affected her entire family and even those within her community.Although the book starts well, I almost quit reading half way through it. The plot lines move slowly, and there are sudden jumps in time. You'll be reading along in one chapter, you run across a break, and the next thing you know several years have passed. However, you don't even know that for several paragraphs, so it's too easy to get distracted and confused. I also think too many sub-plots and the recollections of the characters were not always expanded upon enough, either.I did think that Amanda, Mathilda and Ruth are well developed characters, and you do feel sympathy for them all. However, I would have liked to see Ruth's father, Carl, and Imogene, Ruth's friend (and something else to the story...) more developed. Imogene especially- I felt like I didn't really know here."
4,Drowning everyone,"The title is very symbolic. It does not only refer to the physical drowning as experienced by some of the characters, but also to the suffocating love & possesiveness of Ruth's aunt towards her. It also stands for Amanda's drowning in her own secrets & personal internal turmoils - a choice she made to protect herself instead of telling the truth. It also refers to Carl's frantic search for truth like a drowning man clawing for support & life. In the midst of these all, we see Ruth desperately wanting to be free but finding herself clutching to the one thing that actually holds her back."
4,"EXCELLENT PLOT, ALTHOUGH CONFUSING","This first novel by Christina Schwarz grabbed my interest before the end of the first page. By the end of the first chapter, I had slid to the edge of my seat and stayed there until the end. The reason I didn't give this book five stars is because it was often confusing to follow. The author kept going back and forth between the past and the present, and sometimes I had to retrace my steps to make sure I had a handle on what was happening to which characters and when. Usually, when I get a book that does that, I take it back to the library, but in this instance, the plot thickened with every page, and I could not put it down. The book built up to an almost unbearable climax, but it didn't end the way I expected it to, which was a bit of a letdown.Nevertheless, I am now looking forward to a second novel by Christina Schwarz. She certainly knows how to weave a tale of great suspense."
4,Kudos on a first novel!,"Drowning Ruth is a beautifully written story. Ms. Schwarz weaves her story through the voices of Amanda, an overbearing sister and aunt, and Ruth a lost child. We are taken on a finely tuned journey through their lives to reach a final destination. It is a moving story of love, betrayal,loyalty and the concequences of each. Unlike most stories you can never guess what is coming next. Ms. Schwarz does a fabulous job of taking the unexpected fork in the road. Read and enjoy!"
3,A bit disappointed,"I am always really excited to read any book on Oprah's list. This book didn't get interesting until page 100. Overall I'm glad I read it, but I wouldn't recommend this one. I really dislike writing a bad review...I just expected more :("
3,Just an ok book,"This is a story about a family secret that haunts the people left behind. Shortly after Amanda returned how, here sister Mathilda mysteriously drowned. Her daughter Ruth was a toddler at the time, remembers bits and pieces of that fatal night. Amanda, now acting as a surrogate mother to Ruth attempts to create normalcy through the shattered memories.This novel was a nice story, but not great. I found the story line to be rather predictable. I also felt as though I had to read this book rather than want to; something that happens often when the book is just so so. I probably will not read anything else by this author again."
3,Interesting - but hard to get into,This book is worth reading because it gets better the more you get into it. I think the author has a weird way of writing and it is hard to understand what is going on from time to time. So if you want a read that is easy and you don't have to think - read Grisham. If you want to think about what you are reading you might like this.
3,The mystery unfolds....,"This book was intriquing. Though she reveals within the first few pages that her sister had drowned, The author skillfully uncovered little bit by little bit what happened on that fateful night. As her neice, Ruth, grows older, her memory of that night also brings more information to light. There are times when this book moves very slowly, that is why I gave it a lower rating. Over all it was a good book, but moved too slowly for me."
1,Worst Book I Have EVER Read!,"Well, I would like to really tell you how I feel about this book, but it would most definitely break two of Amazon's rules: Profanity or spiteful remarks/ Obscene or distasteful content. Run away from this book and if you trip and fall, just crawl as fast as you can and don't look back. Here is just a snippet of my the full review on my blog:""This story should have been entitled 'Philanders and The Women who Shamelessly and Desperately Cling to Them Because They Have NO Self Esteem and Would Thus Like to Be With a Man Who Would....""Can't give away any of the sordid details. Never have I felt so violently ill after reading a book. As for the supposed wit (read that little nugget elsewhere) in this book, I've seen more at funerals.Sighs, if only there were zero stars."
1,horrible book,"i'm using this book for a java class and it's horrible. mass confusion and some errors/typo in the book. nothing makes sense and it's very unorganized. if you have to use this book for a class, buy the sams ""java in 21 days"" so you can reference it."
4,A good read,As always Ms. chase delivers an enjoyable read. The characters were like able and entertaining. It was a pleasant way to spend a Sunday.
4,Good read,"The pacing was a bit slow compared to some of her novels, but it has a good storyline nevertheless. It's good but not great."
3,Good for One-Shot,"The previous poster hit on the problem, though did not address it fully. The problem I found was that the snap-on lid provided to ""seal"" the can after initial use did not fully seal the can which, after some time, allowed the remaining contents to become unusable. Therefore, it becomes a one-shot use item. So, if you buy this, get all the tools you want to use it on together and do them all at one time."
5,It works!!,"I was wondering if i was wasting my money when I ordered Plasti-dip, but it works well. It is easy and near fool proof. A couple of tips would be to move slow. Dip slow, extract slow. Start with a good clean surface and don't try to push the drying time. Again, be slow; with patience the results are great. Take extra care in sealing your partial can. If air gets to it it will start to harden. I found a bit of grease inside the rim of the plastic lid makes an effective seal and keeps my product ready for long periods."
4,Lid sucks! Product has many uses and works great!,I have used this for many things but my 2 favorite things are:1. I mix this with thinner and used it to sray on custom sub enclosures to increase durability and provide an airtight seal. Not to mention it gives a nice look that matches most interiors.2. I slap this stuff on my IronClad work gloves to extend the life of them since I do a lot of wood work.Side Note: Mix with thinner until its almost as fluid as water to get the best coat. More than one coat is necessary. One tube will go a long way as well.Will continue to purchase this product!
2,One time use only product!!! Top does not seal!!,"I have purchased four or five of these containers. EVERY one of them has gone hard and dry in spite of properly sealing the container after use. I contacted the manufacturer to complain about the early and quick demise of their product and request a replacement. They refused. They told me to contact the selling store for a free replacement and that the mfg has a replacement agreement in place with retailers. The manager of Ace Hardware innitially told me he has never heard of such agreement. Ace however DID exchange the can for me at no charge. The manufacturer also told me that the container is a ""TEMPORARY CONTAINER"" !!! They advised me to transfer remaining product into an air tight container! It is a little too late for that now it appears. I'd ONLY buy this product if I intended to use it ALL in one day. It works fine when the can is first opened."
1,Very disappointed,"Perhaps I was expecting too much,but this ended up being a horrible mess. I wanted to coat a pair of hand held weights that had lost their rubber coating. Holding one end of the dumbbell, I dipped and lifted. It looked beautiful. Then it started all running back down. I quickly turned it right side up, but it had left a very pointed piece on the top where the dumbbell was flat. THEN, it started sliding back down, all over the table. It was AWFUL! I threw everything away.P.S. I had not thinned it down with anything...I used it directly from the can."
4,I use a lot of this stuff,"My hobby is making walking sticks out of pruned and fallen branches and post them for sale on Etsy. Often, a standard size cane will not fit on the end of the stick, so I solved the problem with this wonderful rubberized dip. I have been getting one can as needed at the hardware star whenever I got low, but somebody told me that the makers were going to DISCONTINUE BLACK!!! I was alarmed enough at this possibility that I ordered five cans from amazon. I do not want to put red, blue, or yellow tips on my walking sticks ... I want black, period. I will continue to buy new cans as I need them and swap out with my stash to keep it fresh, but if the worst ever happens, I am out of luck. Hence only four stars."
5,A Really Good story,"This is a really great story, especially if you're a country music fan. The references to current singers and songs lends a certain relevance to the book, and the behind-the-scenes look at the industry make it that much more interesting.After all that, though, it's just a nice love story, drawing you in quickly and making you care about the characters. I'm looking forward to the next in the series."
2,I agree!,"This printer is so annoying. It indicates now that it needs a new oil roller. So I'll order that, put the thing in and then it'll indicate it needs something else. It seems like I'm always replacing something. I don't even use it on a daily basis.I've tried to order products manufacturer direct; but their website is awful. That makes this another joy - finding suppliers for its never ending hunger for parts."
3,overall preformance is not that great.,The Minolta qms 2200 printer prints great images. However it is very costly to maintain and breaks often. I think these oil rollers need to be better engineered!
4,Quick read,OK info if you want some history and health information along with recipes you could easily search out on internet. Bought in a bundle of items that made book purchase palatable due to free shipping.
4,perfect,"It gave me insight on fermented foods, still have not tried any yet, can't decide on the crock or making my own pickling jar,. Great for educational purposes"
5,Making Sauerkraut,"This is the most information packed little book I think I've ever read. I am brand new to food fermentation process and was lucky enough to have this book be the first I've read on the subject. Now I'm totally hooked, bought a crock and will be looking into all types of food preservation.Stan"
5,Every thing I ever wanted to know a Sauerkraut,I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it to be very informative. I was very impressed with the history information provided in the book. It was also very nice to find out about the health benefits associated with sauerkraut. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in making their own sauerkraut.
5,Best of show,"This book does exactly what the cover promises. The layout and format is clean and the flow of information is logical as well as being easy to digest.Not only does this little book go into details of pickling cabbages and other veggies, it does you one better. There is extensive treatment on the healthful advantages of eating cultered vegetables. For example, did you know that eating a pound of sauerkraut a day for three months, will shrink and remove colon polyps?Then just when you think you couln't cram any more information into a little book, you are given some great ideas on what to do with your lacto-fermented foods, in a recipe section. All in all, a much better experience than ""Wild Fermentation"" and absolutely no political axe to grind.If you are looking for a no-nonesense introduction to making your own lactic fermented food, then you are in the right place."
2,Making sauerkraut and pickled vegetables at home,"This book is a disappointment. I bought it after I got my Harsch fermentation crock and I do not find it very useful. There are 8 recipes for fermentation for different vegetables (in addition to two different variations for sauerkraut)and about half of the book has 9 food recipes all for sauerkraut (ie pineapple sauerkraut, reuben, etc) with a full page color glossy photo on the opposite page of the recipe (wasteful in my opinion). There is a section on adding herbs and spices and it is unhelpful as it does not give details for many of them on how to use/prepare them for fermentation. There is an interesting section on Healing with Lactic Acid Fermentation, but that is about it. The biggest reason I do not like this book is that there is little troubleshooting detail or any help/suggestions for fermentation when the conditions are less than ideal."
2,More objective info available elsewhere,"This book adequately describes how to ferment vegetables such as cabbage with a fermentation crock, but the same information could be obtained with a quick search of the Internet. There is no discussion about the risks of fermenting, and I wonder of the authors' enthusiasm for the ""miracle healing powers"" of fermented vegetables (discussed in considerable detail) might be clouding their objectivity. The authors emphasize the use of a particular brand of fermentation crock, and I was disappointed that alternative techniques were not discussed in much detail."
4,Good Primer,"This is a good primer on making sauerkraut. If you are looking for indepth explanation of pickling other vegetables or more than a few basic versions of sauerkraut, this book is not for you. While not bad itself, I think there are better books out there, especially Katz's book Wild Fermentation. But to just get started and keep from being overwhelmed, this is a good book."
5,It is what it says it is,My girlfriend learned a lot with this book and has perfected her abilities now after reading this its great more food for me
4,Making Sauerkraut,"I think this book is just fine, nothing really special. The recipes are the part that adds value. I was hoping for more variations on sauerkraut, which I found lacking in this book. The other information was interesting. I can recommend this book since it's inexpensive."
2,not much help to a beginner,"Chapter after chapter on the probable health benefits of fermented vegetables, but very little as far as procedure and recipes. If you're making kraut for the first time and your goal is finding out how to make it, save your money and just search online for the procedure and recipes. If you need convinced homemade beats processed kraut for health benefits go ahead and buy the book."
2,"Will give you confidence, but you don't need it.","Use your google. You can find ten recipes and learn as much as this little tiny book can teach you. I have used it's sauerkraut recipe, but sauerkraut is really easy. You don't need this book!"
1,horrible,"As a student, this is one of the WORST books I have ever seen used in a college classroom: 1) There are huge math errors. 2) Examples are nothing like the problems. 3) The variables are often not defined. 4) The quailty of the binding is horrible. Mine fell apart after two weeks! 4) The verbiage is not clear. He doesn't say what he thinks he is saying."
4,Closest thing to a real drive-in experience,"Long live Distort-O! What a fun concept. Turn off the lights, it's easy to picture yourself in a drive-in. In addition to the ""low-fi"" sound of the movie, you also get ambient noises like cars coming & going, people talking, etc. As for the movies, they're standard drive-in flicks. Low budget, bad acting, cheesy effects...the works. But you already know what you're getting into if you pay to see a movie called ""Attack of the Giant Leeches."" No fan of 50's cheese can do without this technically impressive double feature."
3,The poor picture-quality can be improved,"The movies are good, but the picture-quality is poor on Leeches and average on Skull. When i changed the setting on my dvd-player from 4:3ps to 4:3lb, it got better."
3,Useful,"This book consists of four chapters: a definition of haiku, its elements, 14 items that describe the form of haiku and a collection of haiku. The description of the form of haiku is very useful; however, it tends to be more proscriptive than the form as practiced. The collection of haiku is mediocre.If you want to write haiku or teach others to do so, this book should be in your library. Otherwise, there are better books available."
5,Very surprised with them. Good sound,"I bought a pair of these to use for my rear surround speakers. The install was very easy and I was amazed they sounded as good as they do. Great low cost, good sounding option for in wall speakers. I would purchase them again."
2,1 dimensional characters and no plot - disappointing,"I have read Maggie Shane's Twilight Series and enjoy vampire romances. However, this book lacked a plot. It was the same situation from start to finish. Him: I love you but can't have you cause I'm a vampire Her: I love you and don't care. Him: I love.. etc. You don't truly experience the characters feelings or thoughts. The vampire's life is glossed over. There is little interaction with other characters. These people don't do anything throughout the book. I kept waiting and was never rewarded."
1,B-o-r-i-n-g!,"If there was a lower rating than 1 star, then I'd give this book the lowest!This book had no plot whatsoever! The characters were weak, lacking any true emotion. The author kept on repeating the main characters' feelings for one another throughout the whole book, making if feel as if the story would drag on forever.This book could have ended way earlier if the solution was thought out from the beginning. DUH!Please rent this book. Don't buy it. Waste of money. Also, if you'd prefer a great romantic vampire book, then look to Shannon Drake."
1,Painfully Bad,"This was my first ""vampire romance"" and will likely be my last. I have never read anything so contrived since a Barbara Cartland novel. The plot revolves around Rayven and Rhianna who insist on repeating their paltry emotions until you wish to strangle them both in order to get some action. There is no heightened suspense and I had a difficult time finding the climax.On top of that, the author has no descriptive style. If she is going to describe the vampire's longing for food and how he examines the dishes placed before the heroine, she cannot serve Mutton and Potatoes 3 time in as many chaptors. It may seem small but it is an excellent example of the poor planning and a certain laziness in the author's attempt.check it out at the library - don't waste your money on this one."
2,Nothing Special,Predictable and tedious ... there's nothing special about this book. Extremely repetitive writing ... much of the book is rehashing of previous sections of the book.
5,Magical. You have to read this if you love vampire romance.,"I have reade every Amanda Ashley book which has been published and intensely enjoyed everyone. If you love reading vampire/supernatural romances, then you must read her books. They are the best."
2,Couldn't get into it.,"It started out okay until I read that Rhianna, the heroine,was only fifteen. As a mother of a young teenager, 13, I found it really, really, really, really hard to get into a book about a fifteen year old having a relationship with a man. I stopped reading it, then would pick it up again, then stop, then pick it up again. It usually takes me less than two days to read a book this length, and it took me almost three weeks to get through this one. Her age was a major concern for me."
5,A Book You Will Never Forget,"This story will make you laugh, make you cry, make you wonder but most of all, amaze you. You will learn things about elephants that will make you want to welcome them into your own family. They are so human like in a big way. I am a horse owner and expected to be intrigued by the introduction of an elephant to a ranch. Little did I know that an elephant could capture my heart. Very easy and interesting reading."
3,Borrow it before you purchase it,"I seem to be reading a lot of elephant books lately with the most recent being ""Hannah's Dream"" and ""Water for Elephants."" Those may have set my standards a little high because when I read The Cowboy and his Elephant I was only moderately impressed. While this was a nice enough read it was not written in a way that drew me in; it read more like an extended magazine article. It is not something I would purchase to have as part of my personal library to go back to and read again or lend out to friends."
4,enlightening on the history of elephants and bob norris,"this book goes into detail not only of the history of amy's (the elephant) life story, but you also learn social patterns and needs of elephants. as the story introduces bob norris, you also learn a lot about his past leading to his acquaintance with an elephant.the book is simply written. this certainly isn't an eloquent classic, but it is packed with educational content. an easy read, and informative to boot. would definitely make a great pass-time during a flight."
3,a qualifier on my preceding comment,"I would like to qualify the criticism I made in the above post. ""IRA Man"" is a good outlay of the basics. In a way, it's sort of a travel book detailing the author's journey into Republicanism. So, if you're an American and are looking for a view on the conflict, it's probably a good buy (although I think Americans of an ""orange"" extraction wouldn't like it). If you're looking for a book that really talks about IRA volunteers, I would recommend Toolis's book. As a lesson, I give ""IRA Man"" a six."
2,a rather superficial look at things,"I think the author missed the boat here. He apparently had access to a number of Sinn Feiners and Republicans with no doubt interesting stories to tell. But he chose to focus on himself and a lot of ancient history. I think Toolis's book ""Rebel Hearts"" is far better."
2,Better books out there,"I agree with those who found this book not very informative. McFerran talked to far too few people, wasted about a quarter of the book retelling Irish history, and frankly rathered embarrassed me with his naive viewpoint. (How impressed he was that there were well-paved roads in Ireland, for instance.) He's certainly sincere and well-intentioned, but read Toolis, Coogan, Adams, Belfrage and many others for far more thorough interviews, detail, and analysis."
2,"Smoke, fog and mirrors without touching on the murders.",McFerran is certainly impressed with his comparisons between the American and Irish revolutionary movements. He forgets that Washington and Jefferson never took a family man hostage and strapped him into a bomb ladden car or detonated a car bomb in a shopping district of London. There is no excuse for these actions and it has only served to hurt the republican movement. He never even met with the heirarchy of the political movement in Ireland yet takes the views of street merchants as the word and philosophy of the leadership. Apparently the only creditials one needs to be quoted by McFerran is to be in a protest march.
1,Puerile apologist,This should make all the apologists for barbarism happy but those who don't find blowing up old men and shooting policemen in the back of the head to be joyous events while find this tract nauseating.
3,Not Bad But Needs More Specifics,"I love catfishing and wanted to go deeper into the skills of the sport to increase my catch count and size. This DVD series showed some good catches and gave a few pointers but I wanted much, much more on the specifics of bait, season, time of year, location, gear, water depth/temperature, tricks and tips with less scenes of showing off big catches. It has some of what I was seeking but not nearly enough. The tips shown could have been presented in 5 minutes...the rest is a repeat of what we have all seen before. In short, it's not bad but it should be better."
1,Product is Subpar,"My granddaughter received one of these as a Christmas gift. It worked, probably, for a few hours, after which the screen became very streaky and unreadable. There is no information regarding warranty (which probably means there is none), nor with whom to get in touch with if there are problems with the product. My granddaughter, fortunately, has been working on my real computer since she was old enough to sit on my knee, so she enjoys computer learning without the heartbreak of having a new toy turn out to be just plain junk. If you want a kid to become computer-savvy, it would make more sense to set up an abandoned, outdated, but perfectly good, computer for he/she to play and learn on."
1,Junk electronics,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, she was excited to use it, but unfortunately after a few times playing with it, half of the keys stopped working, so the product is essentially useless.If it worked, I would rate it higher as it has the potential to be a good educational toy for pre-K and kindergarten age kids.BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Buyer beware with this product.,"We purchased a Compukids bilingual computer a little over a year ago. Since then, the screen freezes, and now, some of the keys will not respond including all of the arrow keys on the keyboard and the mouse. If anyone needs contact info for customer service, I FINALLY found it. 1-800-374-2744. The only thing they will do is have you send it back to them (Innovage Inc.) without giving you any idea on phone if they have it in stock or if they will need to order it therefore leaving you with no ETA on when you may receive it back. All on your tab. Terrible customer service especially when no manual was provided with the purchase in the first place."
5,Love the Otto series,Brightly colored and cute story - we have several of the Otto books and love them all. The Birthday Book is especially cute.
4,Not Your Typical Thriller,"The setting for this film is post-war England. Despite the appearance of American actor Robert Preston, the mood is dark, angry, and very British. Just below the surface is a seething, barely contained rage--understandable when we consider the terrible losses Britain suffered under Nazi attack. An emphasis on puzzles suggest the pre-war mystery genre, but this story's conclusion is pure noir. While not a great film, this is a movie well worth watching."
1,Terrible!,This charm is a total waste of money! The words are so small you can't even read them. Worst italian charm I ever bought! (and I've bought many!)
4,Great resource for any job seeker,"Dr. Lommel's book, NetWork Access to Career Resources on the Internet, is a wonderful resource for anyone looking for a new job via the Internet. It is an up-to-date on-line resource directory for jobs in the public and private sectors. If you have not used the Internet before in your job search-this book will show you how powerful of a tool the Internet can be. Whether its posting your resume or searching for online resources-this book is comprehensive and well-written."
5,Best live album in years,"Aboyt a year ago, my nephew played the Refreshments for me, instantly I was hooked. since then, i have taken in everything that is available and have not been disappointed. The latest installment is by all means the best live album I have heard in a long time. The music is as near perfect and the vocals are exceptioonally clean. The only hitch is in the vocals on Banditos, the song sounds a little rushed, also, i would have loved for Interstate to have been on the album.Why this band has not blown up is completely amazing to me. The lyric content is for the most part uplifting. The beat is incredibly catchy and with the exception of just a few songs, I have never heard a bad Roger Clyne song.I would also suggest that anyone who likes this music go see them live. I recently saw them (ironically at Billy Bob's Texas) and it was the best show i have seen in many years."
1,Not Refreshing!,"I love the refreshments ""Fizzy Fuzzy"" and thought this would be cool. Not the case.If your strictly a Refreshments fan and not a country music listener I would notrecommend buying this album or even listening to it. It's awful.This is a country sort of thing and the Refreshments songs are poorly sung rehash's.The rest is just... country awful.i wish i had listened to it before i bought it, it would have saved me some money.Just a heads up!Roger what happened?!"
2,Huge disspointment,"I got this in hopes it could replace Ralli Sport Challenge 2. The online option is the main reason I decided to give this a try.As stated before,the vehicle controls are horrible. The terrain does change as the track is driven on by you and the AI. Driving in water will slow you down a lot more than anything else. That feature would be great if it was not so hard to keep the car on the track. The AI will make it look like childes play.I tried multiple times to give the game a chance. Dirt for the 360 was funner except for a boring online setup."
5,An Important Historical Story,"My American Eden takes readers back to the 1600s in this beautifully written story of Mary Dyer, who was hanged in Boston for defying laws banning Quakers. Reading Brinton's book gave me a deeper understanding of the religious intolerance during that period, and the cruelty of those who enforced those laws. This book is an inspiring and important story of American history and of how some of the freedoms we enjoy today came about. An excellent read."
5,Gripping historical fiction,Ms. Brinton delivers a fascinating account of Mary Dyer's life which is vivid in both detail and authenticity. I found this work illuminating about the religious intolerance of the time and the particular suspicion that was cast on many women. Mary 's story should be taught in schools as an important part of our American history. The religious and social freedoms we enjoy today are due to martyrs such as Mary.
1,wasted time,"To be honest I didn't even get that far to see how it worked. The size was to large for the space I had so I had to return it.(No the size wasn't give with the spec) Which where the problem starts getting through to the custmor service and then diffrent phone call back and forth. Made it alot of hassle to return the item, which on top of the fact I had to lose 20% of the price because I returned it. It's best unless you actually see it in the shop don't order it."
3,Not a devotional book.,"I like the book, and the Proverbs in it, however, it is not a devotional type book. I found this while searching Amazon for family devotionals. This book should be listed in a different category."
3,Attention Mac Users !!,"This unit will NOT connect to a Mac. Creative's support states that future support for the Mac is unlikely. Therefore if you are a Mac user looking for an alternative to the iPod, look elsewhere. A pity, because the Zen is such a nice unit..."
2,Depends what you want,I thought that this was going to be a good product that i would have for a long time. But i thought wrong. The zen is good comparing to other mp3 players but no match to the i pod.I wish i had gotten ine instead of this. Im not giving this 5 stars because well the damn thing broke. I dont know how because i didnt drope it and it was only one year old. Anyway the new gen Ipod is AMAZING and only 50 bucks more. Trust me its worth getting an ipod u can chack out the features at www.apple.com/ipod if u have any specific questions about the ipod or zen email me at kevinschaffter182@hotmail.comJUst get an ipod
1,Did not work on arrival -- Customer support was horrible,"When I received my Nomad Zen, it was broken. (Bad hard drive). When I called customer support, I was treated to a HORRIBLE experience.I've used creative products for over 10 years, and because of this experience I'm not longer going to buy their products. I can't recommend a product to a user when the company refuses to support their customers. Try something else, perhaps the Apple IPod.I would be happy to provide more details if asked."
4,Pretty Cool,"I spent a lot of time trying to decide between the Zen and the iPod and I think the Zen was the best choice. The only noticeable improvement was that the iPod had quicker response time on the controls. When you weigh that in with the price and compatibility of the Zen, you really can't go wrong. I use mine for working out and for long trips, so I don't really need to do a lot of track skipping and constant volume adjustment anyway. I haven't had any problems with it at all. The battery life is very good and because the hard drive is standard, upgrading isn't a problem. If you just have to spend the money get an iPod, but if you want something that's just as reliable and will save you money to invest in some good headphones and any other accessories you might want, then get the Zen. I gave it 4 stars because of the occasional delay when constantly changing tracks or changing the volume."
1,Won't install on Windows ME,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas - but after a week of work including 3 hours on the phone with Nomad help - Nomad decided their was NO ANSWER as to why it would not load on my Winsdows ME system. Very, very frustrating. Telephone help was friendly and persistent-- but no answers. On-line help is yet to respond. If you have Windows ME - proceed with care. A second windows Me system I tried would not install either."
4,The Zen Jukebox 2.0,"The Zen Jukebox 2.0 is a must have for the average consumer. This player fits value with an affordable price. With its small price tag and great features I recommend. I recently bought one and have had no problems! Heres Pros, and cons.PROS> Great price!> 20 GB Storage> Small enough to fit in most pockets> Sound quality is amazing!CONS> Software is horrible> Headphones included are bad"
2,"good player, bad connector","I am now on my second Zen - ready to return it also. After bringing the first one home, I ripped my entire collection (~10GB) of music onto the player. I then put the carrying case on it, plugged in the headphones and took it with me everywhere I went. In my car, I would use the car adaptor. After 2 days, the headphone connector went bad. Music would play out of one speaker (mono), instead of producing a nice stereo sound. I then realized the carrying case did not fit the player very well and it put a lot of stress on the headphone jack. I exchanged this for a new Zen. I did not use the carrying case with my second Zen. Again, after two days, the headphone connector jack went bad. I am returning this one for an iPod, since Apple uses quality parts. I really do like the ease of use and the ""one-hand"" design, though. I would just like to use it for what it is intended - listening to music. This really isn't possible when partial sound is produced."
2,Depends what you want,I thought that this was going to be a good product that i would have for a long time. But i thought wrong. The zen is good comparing to other mp3 players but no match to the i pod.I wish i had gotten ine instead of this. Im not giving this 5 stars because well the damn thing broke. I dont know how because i didnt drope it and it was only one year old. Anyway the new gen Ipod is AMAZING and only 50 bucks more. Trust me its worth getting an ipod u can chack out the features at www.apple.com/ipod.JUst get an ipod
5,great choice for a mp3 player,"very happy with my purchase. 20 gig's, sleek, light, comes with all the cables and software necessary and even a case. up and running in less than 4 hours. price is great and unmatched at this point (taking into consideration the capacity and design). ipod may be sleeker and have better functionality but is twice the price - TWICE the price.software works great for organizing and ripping, player functions work great as well."
4,A pretty good product!,"I have had the Zen for about 1 week. The first day I got it, I charged it up (2 hours) and moved about 20 albums onto the player. The software loaded without a problem, the device connected and the interface worked perfectly. The sound is great and overall I am really pleased with the Zen. There are a couple of things that could use improvement:1) The LCD display is very difficult to read.2) The unit is a bit on the large side.But compared to the price of an iPod (my brother has one) those are minor complaints. All in all I am very happy with the Zen!"
4,Best firewire player out there for [the price],Overall I've been very happy with the Zen (Firewire/USB version).The battery life is good and the menu system is very intuitive.The signal to noise ratio is one of the best.Of course the small size is the main feature. Only the iPod is smaller. But a 20GB iPod is currently $...!Through the Creative s/w you can store non-audio files on the hard drive. This is handy for transporting large files from home to office.The only things I don't like about it are fairly trivial.- The ON button is recessed and can be difficult to reach.- The text on the LCD screen is a little on the small side.- You can only access the unit from a PC with the Creative s/w installed. It would be kind of nice to be able to access it as a normal Firewire drive.
2,Just for sitting still...,"Anyone who is looking for something they can use while moving (this means walking quickly to anything more than that) need to look elsewhere. I should have paid more attention when I bought it...in the packaging it says ""no running"", and I am here to say, they weren't kidding. I have gone through 2 of these babies, both of which died due to shock...and in my opinion, the ""shocks"" I gave were not all that shocking at all. Yeah, it has tons of space and is great if you are just looking for space and portability. It just is not meant for much movement, period...give it a thought before you buy it."
5,Great Toy for Portable Tunes,"This is a great alternative for those of us who tend to travel a lot. There is no longer a need to carry a case of CDs with you. I can get great sound out of it, can use it as a backup for my laptop harddrive, and store my entire collection on it with gigs to spare. I've been getting roughly 10+ hours out of the battery, and it recharges quickly when on the adapter. I love mine, it was a great purchase."
3,Wasn't exactly what I was looking for,"I ordered this as a supplement for my high school English class to help build vocabulary. The book is okay, I didn't end up using as much as I had hoped. The words are good, but I didn't have time to cross reference them with my ACT and SAT material."
4,Sell Yourself to Others,"Branding yourself and marketing your talents is among a more recent trend of career development and it makes sense. You want to build your own self image into one of professionalism, leadership, effectiveness, efficiency, and other positive adverbs and this book offers several insightful tips on this process."
5,Great Comedy Singers and Songs,"Da Yoopers are great and funny singers, with their greatest hits ""Second Week of Dear Camp,"" ""A Dog Named Zippo,"" and ""Rusty Chevrolet!"" Speaking of Rusty Chevrolet, that is a great Christmas song that you don't hear everyday. This CD is recommended for Christmas as a gift."
5,Classic Yoopers from a former Yooper,"I remember when I first heard Da Yoopers - I was in high school in Trenary in 1984 when we first moved up to God's Country.... Since then, my views on life have changed dramatically. Da Yoopers have their own genre of music, not quite in the ""Wierd Al"" category, but we're not talkin Willie n Waylon here either. This is a fun-filled, hysterical CD made especially for Finnish Rednecks and those who love them. If you can handle fart jokes, drinking songs, and songs lamenting of Northern life, then this CD is for you. Personally, when I hear ""Rusty Chevrolet"" and ""Smeltin USA"", I get all teary-eyed and long to make the pilgrimmage back to the Motherland..."
3,Rusty Chevrolet,"We originally bought this as a cassette tape back in the nineties because of the song ""Rusty Chevrolet"". The other songs on the album had us cracking up so much it quickly became our Christmas favorite record to listen to. It's as much comedy as it is music so I rated it as okay. My son, who is grown and married, asked me to get the CD for him for Christmas. I missed the mark, but he was able to play some of the hits for his friends post Christmas. For Californians it was a challenge to educate ourselves about the UPs but we're now in on the joke."
4,Da Yoopers - For Diehards Only,This album has some really funny stuff on it... Well-worth the $10 or so that I paid for it new!
5,Da Yoopers! Yippee!,"Bought this CD because of 1 song - ""The Second Week of Deer Camp"".First heard it about 10 years ago, a local radio station started playing it during the hunting and holiday seasons. Love it, too funneeeee! Am still getting familiar with the other numbers on the CD, but I don't think anything can beat "".....Deer Camp""."
4,One of Lovesey's best,"Infuriating & diabolical, this is a terrific standalone mystery by the author of the Peter Diamond & Sergeant Cribb series. Clever, macabre, & full of the idiosyncratic English villagers that all great mystery novels bring to life, this story really plays with your loyalties--in a fun way."
2,It's Supposed to Be Funny,"This is a silly story that is entirely unbelievable. The characters are cookie-cutter, undeveloped, and unengaging. The whole story is ridiculous--it's almost as if Lovesey made up a story at a party for laughs.If you're interested in farce murder mysteries, than this is one for you."
4,works great in car,My husband got this as a gift from his boss. I have it in my car and I use it after a hard day at work. Works great. It is a definite gift for someone who works hard all day then has to drive a long way home.
1,Massage part of it is great- MP3 part is not so great,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He tried it out- the speaker placement was in the middle of his back- so its definitely not useful for a tall person. Also, after about 2 minutes of using it, the wires shorted out and the music would not work. Needless to say, we returned the product. I love the idea of a massaging chair/mp3 player and I would buy one again if changes were made to it."
4,"Beautiful Design, Good Performance, Great Price","I love the design of the old G3 PowerBooks, and this particular model (the ""Lombard"") is no exception.This is a great machine for case mod enthusiasts; the computer comes apart cleanly and can be reassembled quickly and painlessly. That isn't to say that this is a cheap case; these computers are built and built to last. The industrial design with the rubber center also provides for some very interesting paint design opportunities.For the casual User, this machine will meet expectations in the E-Mail, Web Browsing and Word Processing departments. There are more cutting-edge machines out there, but why pay so much when you can get a computer that will meet your needs for about half the cost of today's PowerBooks?This model also has 2 FireWire ports, making it 100% compatible with that new iPod you're dying to try out ;)"
3,Not bad but...,"I recently purchased this book from an eBayer at a very discounted price. I'm glad because after reading it, I don't feel that this book is worth its list price. It's not a horribly bad book, but it left me wanting more. The spells are very basic and each chapter is dedicated to each room, i.e.- the bedroom, the bathroom, the dining room, the kitchen, etc. It's well-organized but just too simplistic for me. I would recomend ""Cottage Witchery"" by Ellen Dugan and ""The Magical Household"" by Scott Cunningham and David Harrington; they have more to offer."
2,Really awful,"Poorly executed and all over the place.This game makes little sense at best. You're met with pointless missions, some new random characters, tedious tasks and a confusing power grid. When given the chance to play with other characters you're left unsatisfied and irritated.The game play isn't bad, but there is no direction at all and the plot is nearly nonexistent. The battles are very repetitive and by the end of the game you're only still playing because you want to see how it ends.It should be mentioned that in order to unlock new characters you'll need to beat the game multiple times. No way, once was enough! Another lousy Naruto game."
1,YOU have to stand for the cinematics,"the game was not bad, well at least it didnt suck at all, but the fact that Naruto is a noisy anoying brat that sometimes stand in a ""Girly"" way dissapointed me. I was expecting more from the game since i read the manga and saw the anime, but it didnt happen. The good, you can do some clones and do the rasengan, and enter kyubi mode. The bad, you have limited skills you can use, you can only do 4 clones at the most, you can only play the others characters for like 5 second each, hear the annoying dubbed voice, but the worst, at least for me, is that every time you do a mission or enter a event, YOU HAVE TO SEE THE WHOOOOOOLE CINEMATIC OVER AND OVER AND OVER. You cant cancel it. My recommendation is that if you're an otaku, of if you like to suffer earlost, buy it, if not, and you are a fan of the serie, rent it first."
3,weak.......,"if you expect to see some content in this game, DO NOT get this game. and WARNING. this game is not the same as what you see in its trailers online. this game was originally made in japan. the most important portions of its original content have been modified for the US version. all the super cool characters and storylines have been cut out to avoid spoiler for its TV episodes.i first thought this game would take weeks to finish. but it only took me 5 days!!!!!! unbelievably ridiculous."
2,didn't come yet,They told me its would've come in 24 hours and it haven't came yet. That's why I gave it 2 star
4,Good game,I enjoyed this game. It gave a good amount of game play and I would definitely recommend this to any Naruto fan.
5,Bag Boy M330,This is an excellant cart. This is a replacement for the Bag Boy cart I had for at least 15 years.
5,Bag Boy M330,I got this for my nephew for Christmas. I have a slightly different model(M310)that I've been using for over six years without a problem.
1,Bag Boy M330 golf cart,This product is a piece of junk. The second time I used it the wire that is used to help fold up the cart broke. The cart is not balanced well which makes it more difficult to pull behind you. This product is no way equivalent to similar Bag Boy products from 10 years ago. My suggestion would be to purchase a different brand or model of golf cart.
4,"Finally, a quality in depth OS X book!","This book succeeds where most others fail.The index is wonderful. Each section has the information presented from high-level point and click to low-level details for configurationn. Succint, yet very readable. Highly accurate.I am mainly a Solaris user, and often find myself in strange territory dealing with netinfo (Solaris is all text file based configurations), and this book covers all of the services you will want (and need ) to configure.I unfortunately bought two other books before this one, desperate for the information. They were the Max OSX missing manual, and Max OS X The Complete reference.Save your money, the other two are now worthy only of paper weights. This book does what the others set out to do.I certainly hope they upgrade it for Jaguar. With the release of 10.2, much of the information presented could be outdated."
5,What Mac OS X: A Complete Reference should have been,"This book has the same goal as OS X: A Complete Reference, but Mac OS X Unleashed succeeds. Instead of a painfully long winded explanation of the obvious, this book not only explains the GUI well, but it also provides further insight that makes this section useful to more advanced users. But the real meat of this book (about two thirds of it) goes beyond the GUI. Instead of ACR's pointless overview of Carbon and Cocoa and useless list of terminal commands, this book provides a detailed look into every nook and cranny of this great OS. If you've been waiting for book about Mac OS X from a power user's perspective, this is it. A must for any OS X user who wants to go beyond the basics."
5,The most complete OS X book todate,"I specifically purchased this book as it was the only one I could find that went into the commandline functionality of OS X. At about 1400 pages it is certainly the most comprehensive OS X book I have seen. All the basic info (which covers the first third of the book) is here, however, where it really excels is in its coverage of the command line, e.g., configuring Apache, clustering, setting up sendmail, compiling binaries, MySQL etc). While none of these is gone into in any great depth it does have enough info to get you started. It also has a handy summary of the main FreeBSD commands at the back.If you are an average user you might be better off with something like David Pogues book, however, if you are a power user then OS X Unleashed is the best book (to date) in unlocking the power of UNIX."
5,Checked it out first and then the best choice!,"... I found that the book is perfect for my needs as it gave comprehensive information on OS X in easy explainations. Oh, yeah. It does get technical. SO, for those of you with some experience can skip couple of first chapters. Also, I found that the price is alot cheaper on Amazon.com, With free shipping and no tax, the book is 25% cheaper that any local bookstores.Bottom line is ""Check it out at local bookstores, if you like the book like I do, then buy at Amazon.com"""
2,Too much fluff,"I have found this book helpful in many different ways but i feel that it could have been better, my background is mostly as an administrator of unix but I am responsible for a number of osx machines.A few points:1. Wherever there was a point of interest on topics such as netinfo and the printing system etc. I felt the sections mentioned were a bit too short and could be expanded.2. I felt that some topics were irrelevant for a book of this title such as perl programming. The aforementioned topic is covered in many different books which provide a much more comprehensive guide to the perl language.3. The book violated a BIG unix system documentation no-no: Printing out 'man' or manual pages to fill out the book."
2,Lacking in many respects,"Coverage of the iApps is far less than it should be, and there isn't enough information for a novice user like myself. I thought the author spent far too much time on the UNIX and Terminal side of Jaguar and not enough on the real-world tips that I've found in other books. A disappointment."
5,The Mac OS X power users pocket guide,"It's Christmas and I've just purchased Mac OS X Unleashed.The thing weighs a ton (1,464 pages!) but is one of the best computer books I've bought. The guys who wrote it are obviously Unix heads but they are also very much in love with the Mac as well so it's got a good feel when reading it.A long time Mac user I've just started to dig into the Unix side of things, attributes, permissions, owners, mounting volumes as directories, etc... it's actually quite interesting.If you're going to delve into Mac OS X beyond clicking around in the GUI this is the book to invest in.I'm currently formatting my ""man"" pages <rolling my eyes and laughing>"
5,Revenge? Forgiveness?,"This reminds me of one of my favorite books, The Count of Monte Cristo. The protagonist is duped in a scheme and plots revenge. You'll have to read this page-turner to find out if he goes through with it or not."
1,They will send you the wrong item,"Amazon continues to send Winnie the Pooh floor mats instead of the flames floor mats. They are incapable of correcting the problem. I really liked the flames mats but I can't get them because no one cares enough to sort out the part number mix up. The flames mats are probably stored in a warehouse somewhere never to be sent to anyone. If you order this product, I promise you, you will receive Winnie the Pooh mats instead. And if you return them for replacements you will receive more Winnie the Pooh mats. Hey Amazon, get your head out of the sand and fix this!"
2,Wonderful book terrible ebook.,Lewis Grizzard is a wonderful author but in the conversion words have been changed. Mere is used sometimes instead of there and many other instances like that.If I had known that the proofreading on the Kindle was that bad I probably would not have bought this book. Maybe it can be fixed.
5,Lewis Grizzard enlightenment,"I loved this book. Lewis Grizzard was fantastic in the columns he wrote for the paper when I was in my 20's. He brings to light many of the differences between Southerners and Northerners. Unlike the other reviewer, I don't feel like this book would be offensive to anyone outside of the South. The story about paying his friend a ""Hollywood"" candy bar to keep a girl from chasing after him was hilarious. He was a very talented writer and he's definitely missed. I think anyone with a sense of humor would appreciate this book!"
1,So disapointed with the quality,Unbelievably poor quality. Who made this DVD? I'm sure Anita would be so disapointed and embarrassed if she knew. Amazon shouldn't even carry this product. I waited for years for a DVD and this colection of videos is great. I guess I'll stick with the VHS until they do something else.I bought two copies from two different places and the same thing.Anthony DiacoMonticello NY
1,Love ANITA... but pass on this DVD,Don't waste your money on this DVD... it's a huge disappointment. The quality is awful. Spend your money on a live concert ticket or CD instead.I can't believe that a DVD can have quality this poor.
2,not entertaining 2 stars,This was not entertaining and did not live up to my expetation. I rate it 2 stars.
2,side mirrors,"Mirrors look and fit great, only problem was they are wired wrong for the window switch.They work backwards from original. i believe this can be changed if you switch the wires around,but i haven't done that yet!"
5,2002 Mustang mirror replacement,"Received a $200+ replacement part quote from Ford dealer- not including installation labor, for a destroyed, driver's remote control mirror kicked (footprint on the housing) in a parking lot. Although it is my wife's car, I thought there must be better prices elsewhere, so I perused the web and found Amazon. What a relief!I know it's not OEM, that it is an after-market device, but I've had great luck with after-market many times before. And, priced less than 1/10th of quote, I could afford to gamble. Shipping costs were actually more than the mirror cost, but it was prompt, well packaged and handled.Comparison to the original, installation and fit were vitually identical. Operation of the remote switch is as it was with the original. We couldn't be more satisfied.We will surely remember Amazon again, especially for this type of purchase."
4,harrowing and impressive,"Into the Tspango Gorge offers the viewer a harrowing look at what it takes to put together and attempt one of the largest supported adventures of the 20th century. Scott Lindgrin, the co-leader of the expedition, is one of 7 of the best big water kayakers in the world. He and his team try to run the previously unrunnable Tspango Gorge in Tibet, supported by 80 porters who have the unenviable task of treking up and down mountains to try to follow where the kayakers went. There's a lot left out, one can tell. But what is there is just amazing. The whitewater sequences are outrageous. The sequence where the porters revolt is terrifying. A must see video for fans of whitewater and expedition travel."
2,less than a star,"A lousy view of possibly the wildest, most beautiful, and most dangerous, remote places on Earth. There is no evidence of passion in this short film, which totally fails to give a sense of people or of place. Viewing the area on Google Earth and reading accounts of people who have tried the gorge are much more enlightening than this overpriced ""little"" video. I, however, do salute the guys for being there though."
5,Humbled...feeling small,"What an incredible journey. This movie puts all other kayaking accomplishments to shame. I would recommend first reading the book (Hell or High Water by Peter Heller) about this expedition to fill in the gaps the movie could not possibly fill. Another great book to read for background on how remote and dangerous this canyon is...The Heart of the World by Ian Baker. Amazing kayaking, brings a whole new meaning to the words ""big water"" boating. Take a trip to Tibet and be humbled by the Tsangpo..."
5,Protecting my expensive knives.,I buy very expensive global knives. I also often cook at my friend's houses. I carry my knives with me and I dont want the edge dinged. These cheap covers have been great. I dont even use the $50 knife carrier. You can also use these to leave your knives loose in a drawer. Leaving your knives without the cover in your drawer will destroy the blade quickly.
2,Pretty cheap,"We had a piece of cardboard , wrapped with tape, around our knives. These were not much better. They were really cheap plastic- cheap quality. Would not recommend - esp. for the price."
4,Very good product,"Unlike some inexpensive sleeves, these plastic protectors slide snugly over the honed edge of the blade and give really good protection from banging around in a drawer. I would have preferred another 8"" sheath and one less paring knife but the set is great anyway."
4,Product functions as intended.,"Item functions as intended. The hard plastic sleeves grip the knife well and will not fall off. This product will isolate the sharp cutting edge from its surroundings protecting both the cutting edge and whatever it will make contact with. Just take EXTREME caution when installing as there is no way of opening/closing the sleeve; which is why I gave it 4 stars. I am sure there are othes that have a safer method of installing, but have not come across them yet. This works great if your knives do not have their own storage attachment."
3,Camping knives,Purchased to store knives safely in our kitchen camping supplies. It works fine except it doesn't cover the back corner of our knives.. I've never purchased knife sleeves before so I don't know if this is common or if we should try different knives. I would purchase again.
2,Dangerous,Returned this set of knife guards. Too difficult to insert/take out knives. Seems like an accident waiting to happen...
2,Covers knife edge but that's all,"These are very handy for covering the edges to prevent nicks and cuts when reaching into the knife drawer. I have them on a Chinese cleaver, a Global 3"" paring knife and a 8"" Shun chef's knife. But while the are the perfect length for the knives, they do not actually protect the blade (could bend if caught in drawer incorrectly or if dropped by accident). I certainly would not look to these for any type of knife protection. Lastly, my Global santukos knives would not fit properly."
3,They do provide a safety shield from the blade,Because of their squared off shape they don'i fit exactly to the knife blade near the handle because most knives are angled near the handle. But the cost fit my budget and they do provide a safe way to store a knife.
2,sent them back,"These guards were so thin and tight, I couldn't get them off my knives safely. I have old ""Knife-guard"" and much prefer them. The newer knife-guard, not sold by Amazon, are similar to these, but a little more substantial. I can at least get a grip on them."
5,Knife Sheaths Do the Job,"Purchased on Amazon, I found these knife sheaths hide the blade of the most critically sharp and long knives. I like the color and fit. It would be nice to be able to buy duplicates for my more numerous paring and steak knives. I hate to buy a whole set for sheaths I do not need."
1,"Too tight, dangerous when trying to insert knife","I can't get a knife safely into these knife savers because they are so tight! The only way for me to insert a knife is to have the blade side pointing up, and even then with all the wiggling to try to get the knife inserted, the blade comes out, creating a dangerous hazard. The knives don't come close to fitting with the blade facing down. Avoid these unless you want to cut up your hand!!!"
4,hmmm,"What can you say?... they function just like they should. I've had them nearly 6 years now, they still function as they should after moderate use all those years."
1,Never received merchandise,Received the Henckels 7-Slot Knife Storage Roll but not the Ultimate Edge BS4 4-piece Knife Sleeve Set. Left town the next day for about thirty days and it still wasn't here when I returned home. Went onto website and could not find any trace of the order. Extremely disappointed with not receiving and the difficulty in letting someone know. It is not worth more of my time but will influence my decisions to purchase from Amazon.
1,Falls right off after a short while,This mirror was installed as instructed and after a very short while it got loose an fell off into traffic. Pay a little more and get something better.
5,Top Notch Jazz!!,I first caught Ray Khalil live at a club in NYC. He blew me away with his energetic and innovative sound. Ray's guitar playing is some of the best I've heard in NYC. I listen to this CD all the time and it continues to be one of my favorites! This CD is a must have for every jazz fan!
2,Just a toy:-),"I bought this camera just as a fun toy. It is not recommended if you want to buy a camera with good picture quality. Buy it as it is, a retro camera with poor image quality."
4,Minox Leica 5.0,"Takes good pictures.Basically it's a ""Point & Shoot"" camera.Most of the knobs and lever are ornamental, only, with the controls actually being in it's menus' choices.It is small enough to fit in a cellphone case for belt carry."
2,"Looks nice, cute, poor picture quality",I bought this as a gift. It is really cute and surely get attention from people but the picture quality is really poor. Think of it as a cell phone picture quality. If you are looking for something with good picture quality this is not for you.
3,Average product,"The camera is a sure head turner: small and cute. The quality of the pictures is average at best, the camera works well in natural light and has a good lens that produce sharp images. Sometimes produce some color aberration that generates funny effects."
2,Suppose to be a quality toy,"You must not have any expectation from this product near to any digital camera. It's a toy! The picture quality is below most of phone cameras even if have a 5mpx sensor. I bought for my kid to bring him into photography world. The proportional size was very interesting as for a 4 year kid it have size and ergonomic of a full size Leica camera in adult hands. Being a Leica replica toy and the price tag, I was expecting some ""Leica"" style build quality. But it's not the case! Build quality it's very poor for what you pay. Battery lever that holds battery into position broke quickly and camera becomes non-functional. Very expensive for you actually got!"
1,Do not Buy!!!!!!,"This camera is a joke! Originally I bought this camera on the shear reason of my faith in German engineering, especially with companies like Leica and Zeiss. The packaging is great, the wooden box is well made with the words MINOX GERMANY on it. Once I opened the nice wooden box I only discovered a cheap light plastic camera with the words MADE IN CHINA proudly labeled on the bottom of the camera. I still gave it a chance and took some pictures only to discover the quality of the pictures. GARBAGE. The LCD screen on the back is so artfully illuminated on the pictures of this camera, once again only to realize that the pictures were misleading and the LCD screen was of poor quality. Save yourselves the money and hassle of returning this and DO NOT BUY."
2,Nice miniature,"I was hoping for a better camera for its price. You are paying for the pure nostalgic miniaturization of a classic camera. My old 2.0MP Sony takes better pictures. The camera is an attention getter, though. People are amazed by the exterior detail and its size. However, it has the feel of a plastic toy. The SD card is hard to remove because you feel like you're gonna break the door that covers it. The picture quality is adequate, except they have a bluish hue which is correctable with any basic photo-editing software. Comes in a great wooden box!"
3,Fashion statement and OK camara!,"This item is more of a fashion gadget than a professional Leica. The pictures aren't so bad, just keep in mind it is a 5 megapixel camera. But perfect for facebook pics! And its so small that you can take it everywhere!"
3,Cute...but image processing a little disappointing...,"I have Leica and Minox cameras. Of course, both have excellent optics. So when I saw the little M3 package by Minox, I thought I'd have some fun with this little jewel. The image quality is fine, as expected, but the digital image processing seems quite grainy. Some work here will yield a much better product. A little surprised and disappointed."
3,More Toy than Camera,"If you want a camera that is going to give you amazing pictures with incredible detail, THIS CAMERA ISN""T FOR YOU.This camera sells because of the nostalgic effect it has on people not because its a great camera. Minox could do a lot better, and I'm thinking about going to Wetzlar and talking to them next week....Maybe the camera would work better with a Flash?, although I'm not sure it will, and I'm reluctant to buy anything more for this toy.If you don't want to carry a hulking camera everywhere you go this is AN option.The only luck I had was that I didn't have to pay the full 200 some euros for it, since this was the display model directly from Minox I only paid 66.50 Euros, (including shipping and 19% Tax)still a little much for little more than a toy."
1,Rip-off,"This camera should sell for $29.95 at Toy's R-US. The picture quality even under good lighting conditions and setup to ""fine"" is terrible. Worse if you use the digital zoom, then the images become unbearably pixelated. Any cell phone camera can take better pictures. No flash, no way to change the date, no shutter or apperture priority, and no programs. You cannot charge the camera unless you connect it to your PC or Laptop, so it's not even practical for traveling. The menu is limited and hard to use and the manual is a disgrace. In addition, it has poor workmanship and is made of cheap plastic, the cord is made of the cheapest leather and has an ugly brown color. Mine didn't even come in the nice wooden box! It is not worthy of the Leica name. Don't buy it!"
3,Slow Read,"This story is based on a moral dilemma that is very relevant today. A good story, that kept me guessing until the book was almost over. This book is a bit of a slower read that I prefer, but well worth the time taken. Part medical mystery, part alternative history, this story is not for all readers. There are some mildly disturbing references to child pornography, racial and regional astigmatisms, and some religious moments that can be upsetting. I would recommend this book to those who can look past this type of content."
5,Great Book,This is an exciting mystery novel that talks about a doctor who gets back from jail and notices changes in his hometown which leads him on an investigation as to what is going on. Huge subtle theme on human life/euthanasia
4,good,"Good to drill a hole as expected. Easy to use with the manual.Hope the drill bits are included, but not."
1,Wolfcraft dowel jig,"This drill jig did not meet my expectations in the very least. I don't recommend it for the following reasons. Consistency couldn't be achieved with any amount of trying, it consistently was off by up to 3/32"" in any direction. The bushings are to short to provide an adequate guide. The quality of the jig was very poor, the locating area was not square. I considered fixing the jig but just decided to return it. After several attempts to use this jig I gave up and did a better job by simply measuring and drilling. Jig returned to seller after two days."
1,Unacceptable drill jig,"My Wolfcraft 3751405 dowel jig arrived from Amazon in good condition in an undamaged carton.This jig has three hole sizes available. The 3/8"" set produced a dowel alignment in a butt joint that was 1/16"" off. The 5/16' hole set produced a dowel alignment that was 1/32"" off. Misalignment was measured by the height difference in the two boards being butt joined.Time being of the essence I did not return the jig but instead I machined one clamping surface to improve the 5/16 hole set and was able to fabricate my panels.This product is unacceptable.Tony Souza"
3,Not for rails and stiles!,"I bought this some time ago and only today took it out so that I could dowel a face frame. For joining boards on edge, this looks terrific. It looks much more accurate than the self-centering style (which I also have) where you need to drill the boards separately, removing and reinstalling the jig in the process. However, it's really useless for assembling face frames, where you need to precisely join narrow boards to wide ones. There's simply no way with this jig to precisely and repeatably position the holes. Nor do the clamps look like they would hold a narrow piece of stock square to the jig. It looks like a useful jig if you don't need to join narrow stock on end."
1,incorrect height,"when I tried simply joining two 3/4"" 1 x 4 scrap pieces of oak, using the 3/8"" holes, one board always ended up about 1/32nd"" higher than the other. I kept trying on other scraps with the same result. Looking closely at which piece of wood ended up higher than the other, I found that i had to add 5 layers of thin duct-tape on both clamps to raise the board that always ended up short. Then it was ""dead-on"" with a smooth level joint. So I conclude that the bar that separates the two pieces of wood was not ""dead-centered"" between the 3/8"" holes. It looked like they were, but never gave perfect results without the ""spacer (duct-tape) I added. Spent a couple hours diagnosing that misalignment. I suppose I will have to play with the 1/4"" and 5/16"" holes to see how they align...am thinking it might need 2 or3 pieces of duct-tape for 1/4"" and 3 or 4 pieces for 5/16"". Will practice it sometime."
2,Awkward to use,"This tool does what is advertised, but I found it cumbersome and awkward to use. I couldn't easily set the jig to mark locations on thicker than average boards either."
1,I don't understand,"I don't understand why this units gets the reviews it does. Every time you use a different stock thickness, the pin location shifts. The ONLY time the dowel is in the center of the stock is when you use the exact stock thickness is is designed for. Yes, the unit adjusts for different stock thicknesses, but the pin location stays constant."
4,Doweling Jig,"This product worked as advertised. I used it to drill line-up holes in an extension table. It has 2 leafs and 4 holes along each edge. To ensure interchangeability the holes had to line up precisely, and they did. Amazon also had the best price."
5,Great Product,"I purchased this product about 3 weeks ago and since receiving it, have built a head board and 2 nightstands for my bedroom. I have also used it to make a couple cabinet doors for a storage cabinet. The end result is great. I build everything in my condo so I use alot of hand tools and quiet power tools. I have been using a hand held drill for this and it works great. I am so pleased with the end result I have decided to start remodelling my kitchen because of the professional results I can get with joints. I would definately recommend this product."
1,Cheap Chinese Junk,I do not know how this thing could get better than 1 star. It is cheaply made and majorly chipped on first use in garden soil that had a few rocks. This would seriously NOT survive heavy use. This is best for shoveling (soft) sand . . .
4,Digging our shovel from Fiskars!,This digging shovel has a sharp spade that slices the dirt. The wide handle allows you to use both hands easily to push the shovel in the ground. Works well especially when transplanting small flowers or bushes. The orange handle is easy to spot when you have many tools on the ground or propped up. Very happy with this product.
3,Not very warm,"On the positive side, this is a very light bag that can be compressed into a small package, but you will be shivering due lack of insulation when the thermometer drops below 50. Actually, the “comfort rating” printed on the bag is 50 degrees, so I don’t know where the advertised rating of 33 degrees came from."
2,"Temp ratings ""extreme""","Bought in 2003 and decent quality synthetic bag for weight/price but beware the temperature ratings. Sleeping near Denali in August and then later at altitude in Sierras in July - September still had me shivverin in my boots (and my fleece and hat and mittens). Now use it strictly for low elevation summer/fall. For a little more, you can buy a warmer, lighter REI down bag."
3,1963 Tamil Film,"Story of two rural families and a city family of good versus bad and the good wins. The story is not spectacular, but the songs are good. One of the hundreds of mediocre movies of the 1960s."
1,Should have stayed in the shoebox,"Horrible book. He fancies himself a modern day James Joyce, and trust me, he just aint! The story rambles from topic to topic in a loose stream of consciousness. I forced myself to finish it determined to find some silver lining. Stick to films!"
1,A book by a self important Studio Hack,"This book is simply unreadable. Basically if you go on a street corner and listen to a homeless person rant, tape the rant, then put it to paper, you will come out with a very similiar book. Stone is not talented enough to write a book with a real story or plot, so instead he just puts his ramblings to page and hopes there will be enough shallow people who mistake it for genius since it is wierd. Kind of like those abstract painters who can be outpainted by an ape."
5,Come Spring,"I read this book years ago as a child in elementary school. It's a wonderful book about the relationship between a girl and her dog that she loved so much. In addition, it talks about the impact of moving to different homes and family relationships.This book is excellent and has made a large impact on my life...I could never forget it. I've been searching for this book for years!! At the time, I was about 10 or so when I read it so it would be appropriate for someone around that age."
5,I adore it,"the music is beautiful and upliftig, as are the lyrics. this is my new happy cd to be played on all rough mornings."
3,Scrutinize The Long-Haired Redneck,"If you knnow anything about DAC as of late, you'll know he has recanted many of his statements when he wasn't ""himself"". This collection is middle-of-the-road DAC. Take him for what he is; or was."
5,This is 1 of the Best Album ever,i remember being stuck in the car with my step-father and mother listing to country music. when i heard David Allen-Coe for the first time i felt omg this guy can sing and enjoyed it. i been looking for more albums of his and this one album is jam pack with some of the hardest song of his to find. if you like good country music are just plan damn good music i say buy this album you wont regert it. David Allen-Coe made me like country music i think he can turn anyone on to it.
5,LONGHAIRED REDNECK/RIDES AGAIN,"AWSESOME, CD, OF COURSE, YOU CAN ALWAYS EXPECT A GOOD CD, FROM DAVID ALLAN COE, I AM A NEW FAN OF HIS, AND I HAD GAVE UP ON COUNTRY MUSIC, UNTILL I HEARD HIM SING HIS SONGS, AND THE MORE I LISTEN THE MORE I JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM AND HIS MUSIC. HIS MUSIC IS HELPING ME THREW THE WORST TIME OF MY LIFE, SINCE I HAVE JUST LOST MY HUSBAND 9 MONTHS AGO!I THINK HIS SONGS SHOULD BE PLAYED ON THE RADIO MORE, AFTER ALL, HE MOST DEFINITLY IS THE KING OF COUNTRY MUSIC, NOT MANY CAN FILL HIS SHOES... THEY MAY TRY, BUT THATS ALL.. THIS IS A CD HAS SOME GOOD SONGS ON IT, SOME FUNNY THAT WILL MAKE U LAUGH.. AND FORGET ALL YOUR TROUBLES..IF YOU HAVENT BOUGHT IT, OR ANY OF HIS CDS, DO, ONCE YOU LISTEN TO THEM, YOU WILL BUY MORE, HE IS ADDICTIVE,CANT GET ENOUGH OF HIS MUSIC. HE TELLS IT LIKE IT IS! WTG... D.A.C.."
5,Another great disc from Elite!,"This second entry in their Drive-In Discs series is just as good as the first! The movies are just as cheezy, and the Distorto sound is as lo-tech as ever! This has everything that made the first one great. If you're looking for a great night of family fun, these discs are just the thing!"
1,Just Plain Awful,"I've been doing Pilates & Yoga for quite a while now and I was really disappointed when I rented this video. I felt like I was in an aerobics class. It was pure cardio. That's fine if that's what you're into but if the title says Pilates, you shouldn't be bouncing all over the place. Supposedly she's a very superior Pilates instructor but if she was offering free lessons, I'd pass."
1,Not really Pilates at all,"I don't know why the Pilates Method is even the title - the modern dance moves were nothing I've done in years of Pilates classes. Additionally, the quality of the DVD is poor, although with titles and music straight from a bad 80's made for TV movie."
5,Worth the money,"I just purchased this tape and was eager to try it out. I like that it is split in two segments and the cover is correct with the amount of time it list. The first segment is 30 minutes long with a mixture of ballet, dance and yoga. The 20 minute segment is my favorite with on the mat workout for your ab, legs, thighs and buttocks. It is the perfect amount of time to use everyday along with other Method tapes perhaps the 15 minute target specifics. I am glad that we have a exercise program that can make us just as beautiful as the stars we see with their more than perfect bodies. No other program have I used has shown more definition in a shorter amount of time then using the Method programs. I like that Music (soft background)has been included in the tape not overpowering Jennifer's instructions."
2,"Okay for beginners, but there is no challenge","I was very disappointed with this video. It was far too easy and did not seem like pilates at all. I liked Jennifer Kries' Method Precision toning much better, although that one is more of a relaxation tape. I will continue searching for a better pilates video!"
2,Find the pilates,"The title of this video and the description of the workouts on the back are both misleading. There is no mention of ballet, dance or yoga and all three are incorporated into the workout. Also Jennifer Kries doesn't offer any instruction before she begins most of the moves, which is frustrating and could be potentially dangerous."
1,Great Workout but EXTREMELY Poor DVD Quality,"The workout is great but this DVD should not have been released with such a poor video quality. It's so blurry, it seems that it was not done by professional people. Homemade videos are better than that. I have some VHS by Jennifer Kries and the video qualities are excellent. If possible you should watch first before you spend money on it. Good luck..."
4,Pretty Good Video,"If you are going to buy this video be aware that she moves very quickly through the exercises without a lot of instruction. It's great once you are used to the tape to not have to hear all the instruction, but the first time you may need to just watch the video without trying the moves. The ballet section caught me offguard at first (I didn't know the difference between 1st and 2nd position), but I'm catching on. Also, she rushes through a lot of the moves in the pilates section, so I always set aside 15 minutes after the video to do more reps of the side series and other leg exercises. This video is a lot of fun; I don't think I will tire of it anytime soon."
4,"Not what I expected, but I do enjoy it","I agree that the easily discouraged definitely should NOT get this workout (I am not usually easily discouraged, but was the first time I watched it.) Jennifer's cues come after she starts her movements, so unless you have the workout memorized, you're going to be playing catch up instead of concentrating on each and every repetition. I'm certainly no expert at pilates, but there seems to be very little of it in the workout. I will be using this just to get me moving on the weekends, since I do now enjoy it, but will use other materials for serious pilates training."
3,Stick with it!,"I completely agree that beginners will find this a bit bewildering. I have had no dance training at all, and I found this the hardest section to master. The instructor moves very quickly, without adequately signalling or explaining changes.However, after sticking with it, I have started to find it a little easier, and can keep up better now. I wouldn't recommend this for beginners and those that are easily discouraged."
5,This CD rocks. All doubters stand aside,"This is my 5th Orb album in my collection and by far my favorite. The ""I have a dream"" version of ""Outlands"" is the best version I have ever heard and always makes me want to get up and dance. Any version of ""Little Fluffy Clouds"" is always an Orb-fan must and, this one is no exception. Ooh yeah, the rest of the songs are good too but, being and Orb-fan you get tend to pick your favorites... Enjoy."
3,For collectors only,"After having heard the studio versions of these songs, I have to say that this is a bit of a disappointment. Most of these songs sound better in the original. I do not recommend this as an introduction, though the live atmosphere is captured to a certain extent (crowds cheering, live sound etc.)"
3,Live 93 (Evil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
2,Early Warner Brothers,"This is a 1931 quickie starring two future super-stars Joan Blondell and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Both were 22. The story is rather bad melodrama, the camera work is still shaky at times, and a good many bit players seem still learning how to act. But for fans of Thirties flicks, this is an excellent example of how Warner Brothers was developing an assembly line of films in the early years of the Depression. From 1930 to 1937, Blondell made 47 movies; this was Fairbanks'28th film. In short, Union Depot is for students of the era. People seeking entertainment should look elsewhere in this rich genre.By the way, the DVD print is fine, if highly overpriced."
5,I read it in 4 hours!,"Jessica Andersen's Intrigue debut is a winner, in my book! I could NOT put this novel down. Filled with great characters and a believable plot/storyline, Ms. Anderson is a fresh new voice in Intrigue's line-up of authors. I look forward to reading much more from this skilled and talented author!"
1,Picture of the WRONG CARTRIDGE,"This company is advertising a Magicolor 3100 cartrigde and picturing something else.It's a great price, but what would I be buyiny???"
5,Reliable,"Its my impression that Timken makes quality replacement wheel hubs for gm models, and in my case 1998 jimmy 4wd it was true.Gotta love amazon and usps for delivering 3 days early. It is packaged nicely, heavy, and expect it to last a very long time.UPDATE: Got rid of the truck 1/15/13, and still no problems from the timken, and believe me I put that truck through its paces.Its quality stuff, I wouldnt hesitate to buy again."
5,Perfect introduction to matrix organizations.,"Great if you would like to understand the pros and cons of matrix organizations -- when to use them and when not, as well as how to implement them and pitfalls. Includes case studies."
5,Powerful!,"Since taking Amrit, I've not had a cold, no longer feel tired and I have an overall feeling of wellness I didn't have prior to taking it. It took about 2 weeks to ""kick in"", but it was a noticeable Improvement from where I was. I've been taking the Amrit nectar tablets and the ambrosia tablets for about a year and I can honestly say my overall health and well being has improved. I sleep better, feel better in general and don't worry about cold and flu season."
4,video review,3rd book read in 2012.number 146 out of 235 on my all time book list.Follow the link below to see my video review:[...]
5,"romantic, moving, sexy","The book was a very romantic, yet sizzling, and sexy. I could read it twice!!R"
2,Send me no Flowers,Send Me No /FLowers is very formularic. No where as good as the more recent booka that are good mysteries. This is the usual love story stuff.
3,Very predictible Good light reading,"This was a good book very short and extremly light reading. I look forward to Sandra Brown's new books because she writes such a wonderful story. These books I consider light and fluffy books when I need a quick fix on a Sandra Brown Novel. I compare Sandra Brown withSidney Sheldon, I think she is an even better story teller she keeeps the reader so involved in the book that we hate to put it down. This book was ok,but not one of her best"
3,Send No Flowers,"When a terrible thunderstorm threatens to ruin Alicia Russell's camping trip with her boys a man named Pierce comes to the rescue. Right from the start the two adults begin to fall in love, but Alicia isn't looking for a one night stand. Pierce is hiding something and Alicia knows it but asking him would mean crossing the privacy line. It is a classic romance that catches the reader from the very first page."
2,Sandra Brown has come a long way since this one !!!!!,"I have read all of Sandra Brown's latest books since probably 1997, and this one is obviously one of her earlier novels, as she has come so far in her writing ability since this. However, her ability to write the eroticism surprised me, as none of her later novels contain this consistent display of sexual eroticism. These parts of the book were written with skill and were sensitive to the subject matter at hand. The rest of the book, however, was pure ""fluff"", and that's not what the Sandra Brown of today is made of. She has come a long way since this book, and I would not recommend it for a current reader of Brown novels. They would truly be disappointed."
2,A reprint that shouldn't have been reprinted,"This is not one of Sandra Brown's best books. It was written in 1984 and probably when she first started writing. That's my guess anyway after reading the book. I suppose after so many years the authors/publishers think they can bring these older books out of the closet and reprint them, and then because of the author's name the younger readers will grab them up. It must work, I see a lot of it. But Brown would have been better off to left this one on the shelf. Because I finish a book when I start it, I read it all. I purchased it because of her name, but I think I've learned my lesson on reprints. Need I say more?"
1,Trash,"Very trashy and predictable.. the only redeeming feature is the kids, David and Adam.. loved them!!"
1,Ugh...,"The story itself is a simply-written and sensual story. What absolutely ruins it is the horrible, awful job Alison Frasier does reading it. Her attempt at ""voices"" is like fingernails on a chalkboard. She makes Pierce, the main male character, sound like Larry the Lounge Lizard. She makes the children sound like cartoon characters and Alicia, the main female character sounds like a cross between Morgan Fairchild and Anna Nicole Smith. I seriously had to struggle to listen to the whole story, not because of the story itself, but because the voices were just so caustic. I know this review seems harsh, but beleive me, it's justified. I recommend you READ this book, and not LISTEN to it...you'll thank me!"
3,"Simple yes, but Enjoyable","This is a simple love story, true; it is definitely not her best material, but good none the less. It has that `stranded' feel to it at the beginning, which I love. I loved both Alicia and Pierce; however I did grow impatient with him throughout the book. But in the end, it was worth the wait. And it warmed my heart to read the inclusion of old friends from Breakfast in Bed. I wouldn't say run out and buy it, I did only because I like to own her books, but at least pick it up from the library. It's a worth while read."
3,It wasn't her best,"I love the books Sandra Brown writes. My most favorite is Mirror Image. I have read mostly all of her books. She's a great writer. This book was a romance only. I mostly enjoy the books that she has written that include mystery and excitement and had much more of a plot. I will always read all of her books though, because they are hard to put down."
3,Well......,This is a re-print of a former book and I believe that it was at the beginning of this talented authors career.I buy Sandra Brown automatically regardless of the cover blurb. If you are looking for the intense story that is normally penned by this author you will be somewhat let down. It is still worth a read but it is not her normal brand of WOW.
4,Classic,"Not exactly like I remember from when I was a kid, but all my favorites are still there. It takes a certain sense of humor to appreciate these -- usually fostered around the age of 8...."
1,Ridiculously Expensive,"This product works great, I just can't get over the price. You need to order so many kits to hang a gate that it costs more than the gate. Once I realized that I had spent $54 and only received enough to hang 1 gate I went to Home Depot and bought a 2""x1"" board and a few bolts, nuts, and washers for less than $15. Mine works just as well. Ridiculous mark-up."
1,Mis-represented product. Rip-off,"This product is described as a ""kit"" which makes you think that 1 kit will work for 1 gate, however 1 ""kit"" only comes with 2 blocks of wood with nuts and bolts whereas you usually need 2 attachment points to install 1 gate. The description does not state that you may need 2 ""kits"" for 1 gate. You are forced to buy another kit and pay for more shipping or take the hit for ""re-stocking fee"" and lose your shipping and handling cost."
4,Victor Herbert at last!,"Though not quite a perfect production, this stands at present as the only complete score to any Victor Herbert operetta, and that includes the dialogue to boot. (Vox has ""The Red Mill"" and ""Sweethearts"" almost musically complete but will not reissue them.) There is no attempt to camp things up or condescend to the music, but the line readings are typical of ""operetta readings"": not for one moment believable. The vocalizing, however, is quite acceptable. Newport Classics was wise to put the dialogue on its own tracks so one can program it out after a first hearing; and a complete libretto is supplied. The lyrics are turn-of-the-century horrible, the music ranges from just nice to really memorable...which is more than we say about most recent musicals. Any theater department should have a copy, and local groups should consider doing this as their next production."
1,"Horrible, unmatching leverbacks.","If I could give zero stars, I would. The leverback hooks for the earrings are different, very noticeably DIFFERENT. One is so much larger than the other, as to be very noticeable when worn. When I put them on, one earring hangs lower than the other. Even looking at them, the other hook is wider. It would be so much money to send them back that it isn't worth it, since they were 8.50 on sale. I will likely just throw them into the trash. I don't know how much a jeweler would charge me to get a leverbacks matching in size. The pearls actually match fine..., though.Not sure I will ever purchase from this seller again, unless it is an item that does not come as a pair.--an update: This seller sent another pair and they match this time, but they are NOT the dainty leverbacks you see in the picture. They are rather large, and bulky and not at all the way picutred here. Save your money."
2,Reunions for Fun-loving Families,"This book was too general with information about planning family reunions. Most of the information was common sense. I was looking for more specifics, such as where I can find resorts, parks,etc. that can accommadate large crowds, catering services vs bringing on food, types of foods, estimated prices for different types of reunions, etc. I did like the idea of guests of honor, family writing brief summaries of their life and interests. This book was just something to get you thinking about a plan. It does not have an example on the actual planning process."
5,This will guide your moods,"Its not often you find an album which can touch the very deepest part of your soul. These songs will, and will carry you gently to a peaceful place to relax and be alone with yourself. Just close your eyes, and let your mind pick out the singular intruments one by one until your whole body recognizes the song as a whole."
2,"In da beginning came da animals, den da hunter who hunted da animals.","Da Yoopers are from Ishpeming, Michigan. Dey perform funny songs about hunting and fishing.

4,"Great Value, good performance","Usually we only purchase genuine HP cartridges, having had issues with compatibles. We gave this a try and so far so good after over 1500 sheets."
5,Better than Lonely Planet,"I brought both this book and Joe Cumming's Lonely Planet guide with me. I was glad I hauled both with me across the Pacific (you can never have too much information), but Carl's book was my clear favorite.The Moon guide always seemed to bring me a bit closer to the Thais than the Lonely Planet guide -- it seemed like Carl is closer to ""going native,"" or perhaps more empathetic than Joe. What a shame that it seems to be the less popular of the two.Bring them both, but if you only want to buy/carry one, make it Carl's Moon Guide."
3,Less than expected,"I've always heard how great these manuals were, so it was my first choice when looking for a manual for my gen 2 Camaro. This book is helpful if you're a mechanic, but I wouldn't recommend it for an amateur. If you have advanced mechanical knowledge and want to attempt a repair only need details specific to this particular model it's fine, but if you don't already have that working knowledge, it will leave you confused and guessing. It makes leaps in details that the less experienced will not be able to piece together. It also provides mostly year specific details and doesn't address the many changes of the generation 2 F body."
3,Disappointing,"I found this book disappointing. Like another reviewer, I bought this book based on the hype and the quality experience I've had with Stu's email list. The problem with the book is that it seems a mile wide and an inch deep in information. There are probably some tidbits here and there to glean, but when you need more than a cursory explanation of any NT issue you will not find it.That said, the book is well-written and well-designed, so I give it 3 stars. However, it does NOT fulfill my needs at all, and that is of course quite a let down."
5,10 stars,"El nuevo disco de Libido es excelente. La personalidad de sus guitarras hacen recordar al sonido filudo metalizado del EP ""my iron lung"" de Radiohead. A algunas personas, sin personalidad, que se dejan influenciar por la sociedad, para ser un opuesto, no les gusta, por la populadirad que tienen, pero si eres de las personas que solo consumen la música, este CD es altamente recomendable... Escuchar en concierto a Libido es un orgasmo sonoro/auditivo!. 10 estrellas!"
1,A bluff,"This southamerican band made two fine albums, over all ""Hembra"". Unfortunely, their third effort disappointed me, because the band went too popish.... Listen to ""Invencible"" and you will understand what I'm trying to say. Their vocalist did a good job but the rest of the band is standard... their songs lack of better arrangements in guitars and drums (its' so simple)... I rather listen to other southamerican bands like La Ley, Charly Garcia, Cerati, Molotov, Fito Páez, Rata Blanca, etc."
4,Light and packed with features,"Being an owner of the original Nomad Jukebox, I immediately fell in love with this unit. This is not as bulky as the Nomad Jukebox 3 or the original. I also own a Zen and keep this unit in the car. Works great and sounds great in the car too!"
3,"Solid, but a few things I'd change","I must admit, the price was right when I purchased this unit...but there are a couple of features that I think could be better designed. For one, the unit looks a little too mcuh like a standard CD player. One of the things that's suppose to make the jukeboxes stand out is there unique design and this one doesn't deliver. However, my main beef is that you can not use the ""shuffle"" feature in individual play lists that you set up. The only way to use the shuffle feature is to allow the jukebox to go into the ""all music"" mode. I have several playlist that I like to listen to but I also like to mix them up a bit while they're playing. This unit does not allow you to do that."
3,Not Bad,"This product worked very well for the first couple months that i had it. However, now i am having extreme difficulty in operating it. It began while i was loading an mp3 from my computer to the player. About half-way through my power went out for a mere second or two, causing my computer to restart. I have tried using the restart button, but that has had no effect. If anyone knows how to fix this please e-mail me at Nyranger72@aol.com.Other then my problem though i would recommend this product to anyone. A friend of mine has the same product and his is working exceptionaly well."
1,Software Sucks with XP,"There is nothing wrong with this player but the idiots at Creative Labs didn't bother to get the driver signed by Windows which means XP will have a hard time recognizing it, and eventually (if you try to reinstall or otherwise fix the software glitch) it won't work at all for transfering files. It was like buying a great toaster that came with the wrong extension cord. Of course Creative Labs will tell you to ignore the warnings that pop up in XP while the software loads and try to help you get into the back door after its installed and doesn't work. These morons just should have paid windows the fee so this could be true plug and play, the way it should be."
1,JnR is the problem!,I tried to order this product through Amazon. The merchant was JnR Electronics (or something like that). Anyway they took over a week for 2 day shipping... and still never got the package out or let me know what was going on. Buy this product somewhere else... you'll be wasting your time with JnR!
3,Awesome for what it does,"This is a good product for what it does, that is, make computerized photo albums. I bit cumbersome to use, slow even at times. Not enough control over table of contents, thumbnails, and index features. Couldn't name the pages/entries without renaming the photos. Then again, my version may be a bit old, I've had it awhile and not received any notifications of upgrades."
4,Great Priessnitz,"It is a great book, fondamental, a must to have for those interested in hydropathy and naturopathy, as well in their personal health. Well, the cover is elegant, but the print, reprinted from a precedent old book is fatiguing for the eyes. Price very accessible. Please is it possibile to reprint it a bit more visible? thank you."
5,September,This has been one of my happiest reads. I was so sad when I finished. All R Pilchers books are wonderful and I highly recommend them. This is a story that one can really believe and goes to the heart.
5,Gorgeous and great price!,"I saw these same boots at a high-priced department store the day after Thanksgiving 2006 for $129! The leather is like butter -- absolutely gorgeous, and they are SO comfortable! I love these boots!Thanks for the great price, Amazon. I joined Oprah's book club and purchased these here for less than $80 (I bought the black ones). What a great deal!"
1,This software does not work.,I pruchased this software to move files and applications from my old PC to my new PC and it did not worked as advertised. I would recommend PC Mover instead.
1,Don't Buy This Product!,"First off, I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied with the reliability and user interface of this product. I planned on transferring my data via a crossover cable (as oppossed to the included USB cable) due to the higher transfer rate. Problem#1-PCRelocater claimed that it had to ""adjust"" my network settings in order for the cable to be utilized...odd...Problem#2-This program could only transfer 10% of my available programs on my old PC for various reasons...ok...Problem#3-The user interface for this product doesn't support scrolling and bumps you to the bottom of the page every time you open a folder (VERY frustrating!!!), nor does it allow you to multiple select programs/files/settings for deletion. This is, quite simply, a program that should never have been allowed to leave beta, and I consider it a complete rip-off. If you need to transfer data, do yourself a favor and either invest in Norton Ghost, or simply transfer it through your network...that's what I'm doing."
1,UNMITIGATED DISASTER! DON'T USE IT!!!,"Not only did PCR UC fail to properly transfer applications from the old machine to the new one, the garbage it created in the process created many problems on the new machine. After all the time I spent on the phone with tech support at the various application vendors, it would have been quicker and cheaper to just manually reinstall the applications. For simple files and settings, the transfer wizard built into windows will do the trick. Don't wast your money or your time on this product."
2,Buyer Beware,"I bought this item as a gift for someone. The description did not say, as far as I remember how much was in each bottle, but they are very very small, only a few oz. total. I was expecting to receive something for the money I spent. I was very disappointed. It is at most two uses, per bottle if you use it very sparingly, actually more like one use each. I see it is out of stock now from the vender and is not avaiable any more, which is a good thing for everyone else."
2,Not very useful,"I used this coursebook during a TEFL course recently. I found Penny Ur's manual extremely disappointing. The chapters offer very little constructive information regarding the theory of language teaching. Ur's standard format is to list a few one line opinions on a subject and invite the reader to list the theories in order of usefulness or importance. Clearly the book is intended to facilitate group discussion and be used in conjunction with the teachers' manual which provides more concrete answers. However the manual itself does not provide much meaningful information regarding language teaching theory and when it came to applying the methods in my own teaching or writing papers on the subject, I frequently had to look at othe resources."
2,"Bad, very bad.","Do whatever you can to find a text that more clearly explains the theories and theories in practice of language teaching. I am currently using as a textbook in an introductory Teaching ESL course. We read out of it, but most of the material is omitted, corrected or adjusted by our instructor."
4,Fresh Breath,"He needs to have one every day, but after a few days his breath is a bit better. At least I can stay in the room with him again. Does really help and I will get more."
5,"short, sweet, accurate","This is a brief account of a former cash-value agent who saw the error of his ways. He demonstrates the rational, logical, mathematical benefits of buying pure term life insurance (for only as long as you need it) and investing in mutual funds for long-term savings.It's a bit dated, but truth is truth no matter how old."
5,Bravo Umberto.,"I am a student at Rutgers University and this novel is the crown jewel of the philosophy program. Enchanting and mystical, this book is to the field of philosophy of language what the Bible is to Christians. Umberto Eco is to philosophy of language and cognition as Henry Kissinger is to foreign policy. Kant and the Platypus is as easy to read as USA Today, but is as powerful as a yoga session. You simply must own it."
3,"dazzling, but...","Eco's theses rapidly submerge in a sea of florid and neologistic prose. They reappear occasionally like the blowhole of some great whale, more suggesting than revealing the unseen beast below. I frequently wondered whether there _was_ a beast, or if the author was trusting in the dazzle of the waves to distract the reader from an essential hollowness in his creation. The book is nonetheless entertaining for those who enjoy grand displays of erudition."
4,Wild movie!,"Had no idea that this thing is real. OF COURSE ITS A MOVIE, but the idea that a fish could become so vicious and take over lakes is crazy right. If you are online, check out this bad guy. Makes a person wonder about end of days."
5,I have fallen in love with poetry all over again!,"My mind was blown from this display of creativity and expression by a group of people who normally go unheard in the literary world. I saw a lot of potential in these young writers and would really like to read more from them, especially those in the ""Love Rhythms"" section. I was particularly impressed by the vivid imagery,grown-up tone and experienced voice found in poems like ""Just Like Your Kiss"" and ""Baby, Baby"". I hope the young talents in this collection will be nurtured and cultivated. And to the authors: Please continue to offer yourselves as spokespersons for those in your generation to whom the words don't come as easily. You truly are gifted."
3,good but expensive,The patterns in this book while good use expensive yarns. They are not for the beginning knitter either. They are also mostly on smaller needles.
3,Caution: Yarn discontinued!,"I agree with most of the reviews. Most of the designs are recycled or little changed from other books. I haven't run into any errors in the kimono pattern which I am currently knitting, but on the debbie bliss website they list several errors from this book. A very important note: the major yarn used in this book Debbie Bliss wool/cotton has been discontinued. Because Debbie Bliss discourages people from susbstituting yarns, she does not give help finding an alternate. It is a hard yarn to match, especially in the colors she uses."
4,Is this really the correct price?,"Why is this book this expensive if you order from Amazon? My friend has the exact book that she purchased from a book store. On the inside flap the publisher lists the price of the book at $24.95.The book looks wonderful, by the way!"
2,Poorly Written Instructions !!!!!,"I agree with those reviewers that say the book is delightful; the patterns are classic; and many designs are creative (booties). The one thing that has driven me nuts with this book is how poorly the instructions are given. I have struggled with the Embroidered Baby Shoes on pg. 116 (adorable!)and can't seem to make the pattern work as it is written. I took it to my local yarn shop and 3 very experienced knitters attempted to desipher the intructions with no success. Instead of beautiful photographs that sell the book, the knitter would be better served with more detailed instructions and drawings."
4,The Baby Knits Book,"I bought this book a couple of months ago and have made several patters from it. Using only Debbie Bliss yarns can get expensive, so I just asked someone at my local knitting store to show me a yarn that I could use in its place. Even with the yarn change they will turn out lovely."
3,Recycled,"She does beautiful baby clothes, traditional and delicate. But the pictures are more enchanting than the garments themselves. They are recycled, a habit with her. I love the pictures, but maybe I should frame and hang them instead of try to make them. It seems to me she should stop putting out books with overly similar patterns and fix the issues she's having with her instructions."
5,best knitting book for baby patterns!,This is absolutely my favorite knitting pattern book for babies. I have made five or six of the projects in this book and they turn out adorable. I've looked at every knitting book for babies that are out there and this one is my favorite.hint: try your local library to select a book you love and THEN buy it if you really love more than just a couple of patterns.
5,Adventures in the Big Thicket,"Beautifully illustrated, this book of several stories will delight both the reader and the child with humor, wisdom and the cutest characters. You will love Hamhock, Bean, Crab Apple and others as you follow their misadventures in the big thicket."
2,A brilliant poet takes a misstep.,"Graham's strengths as a poet--uncanny resistance to simple truth, her narratives that will not cohere--are all but ignored in this volume. Instead, we get an exasperating sameness to her work: general distress, marked by general language. Much has been made of Graham's difficulty, but this volume contradicts that. The cultural and philosphical rootlessness the poet expresses here is simple, unanchored and merely assumed. It is not at all illuminated or re-defined."
1,The Empresses's New Clothes,"She never was much of a poet, but now Graham has descended into pure unreadability. Meanwhile, Helen Vendler tries to compare her to Hopkins and Heaney. And Harvard sets her up as an eminence. These charlatans deserve each other, but leave poetry and its readers out of the loop. It's a preposterous episode in American letters!"
1,"""Smarm"" instead of ""Swarm""","Well, that's not true. There's nothing smarmy about these poems. In fact, there's nothing to these poems at all and the people listed here who've liked the book are only fooling themselves. Indeed, claiming that they understand these poems is another way of patting themselves on the back and I would really love to see any one of Jorie's (many) sycophants write a considered, analytical paper extoling (or even making sense of) the virtues of this book. I am not an frivolous reader or a superficial one and these poems don't cut it. This is an absolutely unreadable book of poems by a poet whose entire reputation rests solely on the advocacy of lone-wolf critic Helen Vendler. These are, quite simply, bad poems. Avoid this book at all costs."
5,Easy and accurate,"I've tried a number of strap clamps and I decided to use only the Wolfcraft strap clamp for two reasons. One, the ease of use. I have with other strap clamps fumbled around trying to get all the pieces together so I could tighten the clamp, only to have the pieces slip out of position and end up with glue all over the place. The Wolfcraft eliminated this problem with it's solid corner braces. And second, the accuracy of the final product increased with minimum slippage during the drying time. I am very pleased with these and wish I had more of them.."
2,Didn't like it,"I'm a carpenter/woodworker. I've been using traditional, no-frills band clamps (one is Pony, the other is from Harbor Freight; both require a wrench or screwdriver to tighten) for many years. Sometimes I use the metal corner retainers; sometimes I don't. These band clamps are a little awkward to set up and tighten, but they work great.I found the Wolfcraft Quick Jaw Band Clamp to be poorly designed. The plastic corners allow the corners of your project to slide past each other. No matter how tight I cranked it, one or two of the corners was misaligned. I quickly removed it (glue not yet set) and re-clamped it with one of the old stand-bys, and the corners are perfectly aligned.I wish some manufacturer would come up with a better design with no-fail corner braces and ratchet-style tightening with a HANDLE (don't like the bulky, lever-ratchet types; most of my projects are fairly small).Amazon issued a refund. Thanks Amazon."
5,For the price you can't beat it,"I've got two of these for making frames and boxes and they work great. Sure, fancier jaws and a ratchet tightening system are nice, but are they worth the extra bucks if you don't use a clamp like this every day? Not for me. Not with my projects, anyway."
4,I like it,Easy to use. Worked great as a picture frame clamp on square edge stock. I don't know how well it would work on frame stock with an angled or curved profile.
5,Our son loves the entire series,"Its a good movie for the kids. Our son watches it over and over and over. He loves the ""Tiger"""
3,Leaky,"I like the water flow, that's what I was going for when I bought this shower head. But it leaks at the joints. Not very exciting."
3,Nice product for the $$,"In my opinion if your looking for a bargain rain shower head, you found one. It works well no leaks no problems so far. I wish it was bigger but again for the price it was a good buy for me."
3,Small,It was smaller than expected. It arrived on time. The chrome looks nice and is simple enough to install. Just wish it was bigger
4,Interbath All Directional Chrome ShowerHead,"Received the Interbath All Directional Chrome ShowerHead a day earlier the estimated. Connected it and it had a manufacturing defect in a none moving joint which caused a serious leak. I am returning it but, I will get one more as it is other wise to be very adequate for what I wanted. The rotating joints did not leak when tightened. Has good flow from the head without removing the flow restrictor (would be better if it was not leaking through the hole). Will post a follow up when I get the replacement."
5,Love It -!-,"I've had one of these shower-heads inevery shower I have ever had. I love theprice, adjustability and the ""rain"" effect.Not really for the water-conservationists.If you're one of those, then go wash yourselfin a puddle."
4,"Easy installation, easy to adjust, and works great!","I bought this to replace an older handheld shower head, wanting something that could adjust for height, as well as have a sturdy construction. Made out of nothing but stainless steel with chrome plating, the joints are solid, and the adjustment screws hold firm. The spray on this feels soft, with an area of coverage that is greater than most typical showerheads. No high pressure or adjusting spray settings with this one, but I didn't want that when looking for the new shower head. For the price, this shower head really can't be beat as far as overall value. I've paid double for other showerheads, which didn't perform or stay as tight upon adjustment as this one. Buy without caution!"
3,Tabs are bothersome,"I have not experienced any issue with water pressure as others seem to have, I think the showerhead does what it is supposed to do effectively.The only issue I encountered with this, since it is a chrome showerhead, the small tabs and washers in the tabs don't seem strong enough to hold up the showerhead once water runs through it, making it heavier and slowly folding down. Can tie it up or glue the pieces but then it seems not exactly as it was intended to be used."
4,OVERALL...VERY SATISFIED!,Because of all the hype of this in the reviews...i was expecting something really amazing...so it dissapointed me just a bit...BUT i still really like this shower head and have kept it and LOVE the way it feels! Much better than my previous one! I say its definitely worth the price! Very good buy!
1,Tiny and flimsy,"This showerhead was tiny! I have no idea how they could refer to it as a ""rainfall""-style showerhead. It couldn't have been more than 3 inches in diameter. How are you supposed to get drenched by that? It also felt very flimsy and and not solidly constructed. I immediately returned it. Don't waste your time and money on this one."
1,Why don't they mention ANY dimensions on the Amazon add????,"BECAUSE IT IS MUCH, MUCH SMALLER THAN IT LOOKS IN THE PICTURE!Bad, or almost False Advertisement. Come on Amazon and Interbath - be straight forward and honest about what you're selling. Almost all the other models by the same company and sold by Interbath mention the dimensions. On this model the provide closeup pictures, with no reference to a hand or other object that would allow the viewer to gauge it's actual size. Shameful!I wish I could give the seller in this case the bad review, since it's their fault, accidentally or otherwise - that the purchaser doesn't have a clue what size the item is.The product isn't the best, but it's not bad either - just much smaller than the picture makes it look. Buyer Beware! I'll stick to books and electronics with Amazon - no more cloths or other items, thank you."
1,All-Directional Chrome Showerhead/ you need alot of water pressure,You have to have a ton of water inorder for this to work. It's alot smaller in person. It sux
2,Not Worth It,"The image online was more attractive than the actual product. I could not use it, my local hardware store had better products for just a few dollars more. Did not care to send it back cause of cost of shipping and my time."
4,Nice....and for the price!,"I returned a cheap and crappy Oxygenics head for this much less expensive one. It has great adjusting features and creates a nice, even shower of rain upon you. I have a dual shower, so this is my overhead soaker in conjunction with a more powerful spray model. I cant imagine finding a better shower head for the price."
3,Mixed,"Easy enough to install with a little plumbers tape. I removed the small limiter but the water pressure was still dramaticallyreduced.It does a good job of raising my inlaws very low shower. My wife likes the wave effect & lower pressure, I do not. Personally, I can't recommend this showerhead."
2,Very poor product,"The only reason I didn't have 1 star or 0 stars is because the water pressure that comes out is good......besides that, this thing doesn't have a lot of redeeming qualities. The biggest issue is where it connects to the water source is a solid piece and not adjustable so if you are unlucky enough to get it to point at an odd angle, you are stuck with the initial flow from that unless you want it loose and leaking water. Then the fact that even if you tighten the washers on the arm, the thing still sags even if they are at their tightest means you have to crouch down to get your head under the flow of water. I guess you get what you pay for and I learned my lesson. I will be returning this asap."
5,"this is a geat, relaxing shower head","Love this, I'd put it in all my bathrooms!I provides a great waterfall feeling and you may not want to get out of the shower.Great for the price too!"
5,chrome shower head....,"great for showers where you need the extra hight for the tall people.but can lower for the short ones.....took a bit to figure out how to install with the arms going the right way from the wall ,and i have install a quite a few.... great shower head and arm, it soaks real good not just the little drops.....very well made. works great ,at a great price...."
4,different then they original model,"I had the original shower head with the multi holes.. Had easier attachmen to shower, but this one is very good for the price."
5,Great Product,"This is one of the best 'rain' shower heads at this priceeveryone who's used it, loves itbuy it!"
4,"Great price, great product","This showerhead just took a quick minute for my husband to install. My husband is 6 foot 3 inches and he has always complained about showerheads being too short for him. This showerhead has an extending pipe that makes it more than tall enough for a person over 6 feet. The ""rain"" feature is so nice after a long day of work or stress, the water pressure is perfect and I would definitely recommend this product."
1,Leaky,"Just installed this at a tall customers home that needed a higher showerhead and it leaks at the first ""pivot point"". I will be buying a better quality adjustable shower arm to replace this one."
2,don't purchase unless you have a really low shower head pipe,"if you have an unusually low shower head pipe in your shower, this product will be a good, especially in if you are tall (over 6 foot)if your shower head is at the normal highth (about 6 ft high or greater) go with the oval shaped shower head from waterpik... 34.95 at home depot, but home depot just discontinued it... i went through 4 rain shower heads before finding the best product... the waterpik oval is amazing plus you don't need to remove the thing that keeps the water usage at 2.5 gallons per minute and it still works brilliantly... great shower experience with the peace of mind of environmental responsibility and cost savings....here is the link to the best product... don't let looks deceive you![....]waterpik ecorain shower head!Enjoy -- i wish i read this review first!"
2,You get what you pay for...,"After reading the numerous reviews of this shower head, I decided to give it a try.. It arrived in a plain white box and after opening it, I discovered that the head itself is nothing more than a tin can with holes poked in it.. The extension that it came with was of decent quality but that didn't stop it from leaking.. I installed the item, against my better judgement, and after turning on the water, I almost died laughing.. I always believed that you get what you pay for but after seeing all the positive reviews, I had to give it a try.. That mistake will not happen again.. Happy shopping.."
4,It's gonna rain on your head!!!,"I had one of these years ago when they were selling on QVC for about $30.00. Innovative technology. Note, this does not provide the type of water pressure that you'd use for a back or shoulder massage. It does provide a downpour of water that will drench you and rinse every ounce of shampoo and soap off your body. It's very relaxing. The amount of water it puts out is amazing. The only thing it lacks is a directed spray for spraying the nooks and crannies (yes, we all have them - haha). But there is a solution. In addition to this showerhead I purchased a ""not too pricey"" combo shower unit that has both a directed handheld and over the head shower. I kept the directed handheld portion but removed the over the head one and replaced it with the rainfall showerhead. Problem solved. I treat myself to two showers a day. So soothing."
1,crap,"This was the biggest piece of garbage. It was smaller then I had ever imagined, it leaked, it wouldn't away in place, it was a nightmare."
5,Havent found a better shower head,Solid construction. Great linked-metal hose. I've been using it for nearly 6 years and have never had an issue. Dont get fooled into other shower heads with tons of settings that never really feel all that different.
5,Longevity and Function! Great build quality for 20$,"I bought this shower head, believe it or not, 8 years ago. It has never failed. The holdes will get clogged but setting the head in CLR for a couple hours makes it new again.This head has a slightly harder spray than other heads of the sort. It is well worth the money IMO."
5,"Rain Rain Come Today, This Shower Will Be Ok!!!!","Rainshower with every shower, I love this showerhead, not only does it save water, it gives you a refreshing shower everytime. I have had one of these for years, and while updating both my bathrooms, I decided to put one in both. I love the effects you get with this showerhead, it is high quality and lasts a very long time. If you want a spa feeling in your shower, I highly recommend this showerhead."
4,Great shower head. Great price.,"I bought two of these for gifts, and tried it first in my master bath to see if it works as good as my australian wonder shower, which retails for $70-$100. I did remove the flow restrictor. I was amazed how similar it was, great rain shower effect. What's even more interesting is that besides raining down, it feels like the water is swirling as well. I'm very impressed. I will be buying more for christmas gifts. Thanks!"
3,"Good for the price, for the short term","I was pretty happy with this product, but after less than a year of use, it's leaking like crazy. Maybe it's the dry climate here, but the pivot joints are spraying water everywhere (over the curtain and out of the shower). The shower is used ~5 times a week, and the angles haven't been adjusted in a long time, since I positioned things where I wanted. I've tried to re-adjust the head and tighten to restore the seal, but no luck."
2,I wasn't pleased !,"I have this installed and I'm not returning it. I would not advise anyone else to buy it. If like me you have been a very satisfied customer of the now hard to find Down Under Wonder Shower, you will be very disappointed. This looks similar but looks can be deceiving. There were no instuctions, not important if you've had something similar before but a big deal if you haven't. The deal breaker flaw is that the nut that screws onto the fixture in the wall and the arm are one piece. The whole arm turns when you are tightning the nut and that is not a good thing. It was a very difficult process to get the arm to end up in the proper position. It's there and works but it's crap. That's the best that can be said about it. Don't buy this! You won't be happy."
2,Leaky elbows...,The item came just as described and i installed it per the directions. After completeing the install and testing it...both major joints were not sealed properly and leaking i tried to fix it with a rubber gasket i had laying around and it improved but it was still fail... I was sad cause its not worth the hassle of returning it so now i just live with it until i end up buying a high quality shower head.
4,Excellent quick fix for a short shower,Great showerhead! I rent and have a shower that is too short for my height. This showerhead was super easy to install(no directions included) and has excellent coverage/flow(I also removed the flow reducer). Would definitely recommend for anyone needing a quick fix to a short shower.
3,Small & Leaks,"Just got this. The head is much smaller than I though it would be, I didn't look at the dimensions when buying but it is only 3.5"" round, I thought it would be slightly bigger. It also leaks where it bends, but not horrible (I think most, or all leak eventually anyways). It has good water pressure after I took out the little black ring, and it really does swivel just about any direction. For $17 it isn't bad, and my wife says it looks fancy."
1,False advertising!,"This showerhead is advertised with a misleading picture that makes it appear much, much larger than it actually is. THe actual diameter of the showerhead is only about 2.5"" and in the pictures it appears to be 6-8"" in diameter. I returned this immediately after I purchased it. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS IS YOU WANT A SOAKING SHOWERHEAD!!!"
3,Fair,"For the price you pay, it's okay, but I've had better. Maybe our water pressure is too low, but it shoots out in different directions and doesn't flow evenly. The price was very good, which is why we got it and it's better than what apartment had provided for us, but it isn't great. The extension arm is nice.Good price. Mediocre product. Easy to install."
5,GREAT SHOWER,"Have been using this shower head for many years. It is getting a little hard to locate, but worth the effort.Great spray pattern, like a small water falls."
5,best ever,I got this a while back to replace one my Wife got on QVC. greatest shower ever.I took out the diverter and go full throttle.Had to replace the bolt on the original and all it took was a Phone call to the manufacturer and it was replaced no charge.have nothing but fantastic to say about this product
3,Good shower head.,"This product is a replacement of the one we had for 3 years. We have good water pressure, so we have the waterfall effect. However, when we shut the water off, water continues to come down and no matter what adjustment we tried, it still does not cut the water off completely for a minute or so. Other than that it is ok. We also had an issue on the shipment fee. We thought it was free shipping but it was not. The product does the job so we are still using it."
3,adjustable showerhead,"The shower head itself is great...the water flow is perfect. The problem is that the arm doesn't stay up and I have it tightened as tight as I can get it. I am not sure if it is designed that way or not, but I have to constantly keep pushing it up every time I take a shower. When I went away for a week it was down against the wall of the shower."
4,Excellent way to hide a pole in plain sight.,"These pole covers greatly improve the appearance of a support pole without taking up the extra space required to box in the pole. They also are a lot less work than boxing in a pole. One of them is at the bottom of the stairway and it supports the stairway handrail. The kids grab the pole and swing around it as they enter the basement.I ordered them with maple veneer. Unfortunately, the sanding required to smooth out the seams was more than the thickness of the veneer. To cover the seams, and the rest of the pole, I used 2 ft x 8 ft pieces of maple veneer from a local hardwood store."
4,Awesome drill,"I have had my share of the makita 14.4 drills(older style like the 20th anninversary model)and I can tell you the newer style dewalts are fantastik. I am a Electrician and use this drill everyday from driving screws to .... 4"" holesaws!! I know this is not recommended by dewalt but it will do it. I have had mine for 1 1/2 yrs And it is holding up great. I drill a lot of sills with a 1""x 18 auger bit. Switches hold up and the 3 speed gear box is the cats meow. I put a 1/8"" bit in the chuck on high speed and use it to cut out around boxes in sheetrock like a router.The ratchet clutch has not let go yet or slip.The torque is all you want without the extra handle.My only wish is to see nimh batteries. The xr packs absolutley hate cold weather and are cycled through the charger steadily"
4,REPEAT,I wrote a review for this drill a long time ago but it is gone. After reading the most current reviews I am confused. I am an eletrician and as the other reviewer (an eletrician) use tools a lot on the job. What i am confused about is the newer drills. My drill is made in USA. I have noticed the speed change switch being tricky to move at times but no big deal.I wish the othre battery drills I've gone though had only this type of problem. Because of this annoying problem and the torque clutch which is set way too high at the lowest setting I gave it 4 stars.I just have not had the problem these later drill have had.Are they really making these outside the USA. That could be the problem. You would not think that would make a difference but it does.I have other tools that are now lower quality because they are no longer USA made. I think these companies let the quality go out the door when they go outside the country for manufaturing.Then the price stays the same. Oh well.
2,"Good drill, but with serious faults.","I bought this drill, used it for a few days, and I ended up returning it. My overall reaction is that the drill is a workhorse, but it has some serious design flaws.First, the good: The XRP system is fantastic. Plenty of rugged power. Case, battery, and Dewalt interchangeability is what you'd expect from the brand. Good weight for the power delivered. Overall, decent first impressions.Now, the bad. Granted, these are minor things, but we're talking flaws on a $200 ""professional"" drill. The clutch doesn't work in 1st gear. It's an inherent design flaw of the model confirmed by Dewalt. Combine that with the fact that speed selector switch locks up, and in my mind, you've got a badly designed drill.If you can deal with these two issues, then by all means, it's a great drill, and you'll be happy. But, those two things drove me nuts. Because of the two aforementioned faults, I returned mine, and the search continues."
1,didn't last long,I have a DeWalt corded drill and a plate jointer--I like them both. One battery on this cordless failed after only one month. The gears also sound like they are about to fail- a lot of clunking when the trigger is released. I also have a 15.6 V Panasonic--it beats the DeWalt in every way. I wanted to buy American. The DeWalt is made in Mexico. I'm sorry I bought it.
4,HP 4200 Cartridge,"I have always found this to be of good quality, and much better than buying a non HP brand refill. My purchase through Amazon was the cheapest I was able to find it."
5,No title,This product worked very well. I am completely satisfied with this purchase. I would buy again and recommend this company to anyone.
3,HP LaserJet Q1338A Toner Cartridge,I would recommend that you buy a secondary market toner cartridge (non HP) and save over 50%.
5,A Great Book,I really liked this book. It was exciting to read and I hope that the author writes more.
5,Extremely creative and well written.,"I have read the whole series and highly recommend all of them. Ms. Roberson is creative and thought provoking. She accomplishes both with a beautiful writing style that evokes very real images of her characters, their personal triumphs and tragedies and that of the Cheysuli race. There is tragedy and triumph in abundance here from a fertile and well thought author and while eight books may seem like many, it won't after you have read the first one! Read and enjoy!"
5,Westar EM8719 Engine Mount,"This Engine Mount is and exact fit in my 97 Elantra, very well made. And for he price it cant be beat"
2,"sounded great but only lasted 2 weeks,had to send it back",The sound was great from this product. But it quit working only after 2 weeks of use.Had to send it back.
1,dissapointing,Don't waste your time. I bought this and the first one I recieved was broken. Amazon promptly replaced it. But it came with the housing cracked. Sound was muffled and crackleing. Replaced it with a BIC lets see how that turns out.
5,Course Book I Actually Want to Keep Reading,"This compilation of short stories was used for my Intro. to the Short Story college course. Our professor only picked out certain stories but I found myself reading unassigned stories myself. Some of these stories are wonderful. My favorite was ""The Widow's Son"" by Mary Lavin. Some other noteworthy stories: ""Hills Like White Elephants"" Hemingway, ""Girl"" by J. Kincaid. Too many more to list, a course book I am actually keeping so I can finish reading it. Usually I can't wait to close them after the course and not see them anymore! :)"
2,Tao of Two Stars,"This is a Brian Sumner film, produced by the slick heads at 900 films. Insight into why Sumner (spirtually) has talent as a skateboarder, is offered up here. However, this film is advertised as being a Bam and Tom Green kinda thing, not the case. Bam's total time in the show is around two minutes, and Tom's bonus footage equals out to four or five minutes. Half of the video is filled with kid's who can skate, but are not instructor's by any means. The music editing is horrible and leaves you guessing as to what is was that Sumner had just said. He is already hard enough to understand, without the crappy soundtrack mixdown. The cinematography is first rate. There are very intense angles and close-ups on the tricks themselves. Some of the best slo-mo work that is availible, resides on this disc. The detailed camera work and menu of tricks does not save this ""film"" from the slew of ""how to"" videos out there."
5,Love the red color,"I like the ease of handling especially the peeler. It is the best one, in ease of using, that I have ever had. Buy it from Traget!!!! Amazon charged me an extra $10.00."
5,Love this in Blue,Got all these but the ice cream scoop in blue and they are my favorite little tools to date. I do quite a bit of baking for my little family and these come in so handy and clean easily. I would definitely recommend them to anyone!
5,Form AND function,"My sweet sister gave me this set for Christmas in 2003, and I absolutely love it. Each piece handles really well, and looks great. Each piece is substantial, but not heavy, and fits well in your hand. The can opener works like a dream. And they look fabulous!"
3,Stacy Q. Hard Machine,"Despite a small pinprick hole in the disc, it still plays fine. I really enjoy the 80's!"
1,Worst Headers ever,"its not the same length as the stock header, to install you have to push the bpipe and the cat up to force it to fit and after that you realize its not machine right and you have a huge exhaust leak, i Bought one and i have a huge exhaust leak i tried every single gasket to stop the leak. DO NOT BUY THIS"
5,McKeown's Price Guide to Antique & Classic Cameras 2005-2006,Book is very easy to use. Price and picture are on same page. Great descriptions. Large amount of cameras listed.
5,There's no better!,"There is no better source of information about older cameras. With hundreds (thousands?) of photos and excellent descriptions, if you collect, buy or are just interested in cameras you can't go wrong."
3,Slightly disappointed,"Good product, looks good, but have problems with the date being correct. Also some instructions could be better."
4,Vote for Pedro T-Shirt,The merchandise was delivered on time and was of good quality. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
5,Elegant bouquet of beats and sounds,"Very enjoyable! The airy, delicate and dreamy landscape of beats and noises make you feel the joy of discovering mystical unseen world. Although the stories vary in mood, each story is complete in concept. I often listen the album for several times in a row. Will there be new releases soon?"
3,Sky painting,"The stroy was simular to one I have read before, I love twists in story's and this one had all that is expected, a little history, a little murder, a little jealousy, a little romance, yep this book has all the right ingredients."
2,Designed to last... one year,"I have the previous model RD-XS32, and was very satisfied with it until, like magic, it started malfunctioning right after its first birthday. Now, even after repeated cleanings, it fails to read many of the DVDs it created, and getting it to create a usable new DVD is nearly impossible. This is very disappointing because I'm running out of brands whose products DON'T poop out after one year of use... I have always thought those extended warranties were useless but I'm beginning to wonder whether or not it's necessary protection these days."
1,Not ready for market,"This thing has locked up twice tonight, and at least once a week since I've owned it. Don't buy it."
2,I'd rather have a separate DVR and DVD-R,"Sure, this does what it says, it just doesn't do it with any sense of style. Mainly, the interface on this thing is terrible! I think for a simple setup (TV and this device)this would work fine, but for anything advanced, this isn't the device you want.I like to run all my components through a Sony STR-DG800 so it can do all my video and audio switching and conversion, and control the whole thing with a Logitech Harmony remote. Trying to program the remote for different activities (Watch TV, Watch DVR, Record TV) doesn't work well with this device, since it barely knows what mode it's in, and your amp will always be on ""DVD"" input for DVD, DVR, and TV. This can be confusing to other people who try to use your system.If you have an advanced setup, I'd buy/rent a DVR that is easier to program for recording, and then save to your separate DVD-R device when desired. It would have taken me *far* less time to setup and learn."
2,Didn't work properly,"Unfortunately, the set that we got did not work properly.The ferris wheel would not attach to the set properly and, thus, caused the whole thing to be a bust.Sad."
1,"Great concept, horrible design","We bought this for my 4 yr old for Christmas, because he love rollercoasters. There are not a lot of rollercoaster toys out there especially for his age. He was so excited to get it. I spent about 30 min putting this together. The pieces kept popping off. If one piece doesn't work the whole thing doesn't work! Also, the roller coaster track did not touch the ground at the end of putting it all together. I seemed like the track was not long enough. I got frustraed with the ferris wheel popping off the sides and decided to return in! We got two other rollercoaster sets recently that my 4 yr old loves and they work for about the same amount! Although it will be many years before he can put them together."
2,bad manufacturing...,"My gears ratios don't line up across the product so it skips and stops instead of running smoothly (the problem is in the carousel gears). Also one of carousel horse fulcrums is too stiff and had to remove it completely for it operate. AND, the ferris wheels kept popping off their anchoring points, had to actually glue them in. Also it is very noisy. My kid liked it for about an hour.... then hasn't gone back."
1,Disappointed!,"My son put this together the day after Christmas and it worked smoothly. He was very excited about it. The next day, he took it down so he could rebuild it. It no longer went together. It was as if the plastic swelled and the parts were too big to put together. I don't know what to do with it. It sits in a box because he doesn't want to throw it away, however it is impossible to build again."
5,"Fun to watch, improved","The other reviews on here are from 2005 and I believe they've improved all the pieces. Things do fall apart here - but that's because our 1 year old takes it apart! Seems to be a big hit! Took about 45 minutes to put together, but I had some extra ""help""."
1,Looks like fun but is a piece of junk!,"My 3 YO really wanted me to put this together, the manual is pictures so not too bad to put together if you think about some of the assemblies.There are several issues with this toy that really make it only fit for the garbage:1. Everything is flimsy and comes apart easily.2. The motor gearbox jumps when trying to drive everything, it would only drive the ferris wheel.3. I had to use a hammer on the roller coaster car as the wheels were too wide to fit on the track.4. After using the ferris wheel for a while, the support towers would fall apart.I can see the potential for this being a great toy, however it needs to be redesigned."
1,KNOB IS ALREADY IN TRASH,"This knob was the cheapest, ugliest knob I've ever seen. Its already in the trash. I could have gotten better at the dollar store! Don't buy if you dont' want to be disappointed!"
