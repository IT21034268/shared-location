5,Great Camp Chair!!,This is an extremely sturdy and comfortable camp chair that is well suited for the large person or those with a bad knee/hip who need strong support when heaving themselves out of the chair (both in my case!). I was very pleased with the wide seat...no pinching of thighs etc. This makes a good camp or deck chair and I have even used it in the living room when I needed extra seating for guests.
5,camping chair,"perfect,excellent,over the top -I love this chair its strong-liteweight-easy to fold and unfold-works great!"
5,"Comfortable, lightweight, folds flat","My wife and I were looking for comfortable, lightweight chairs that we could take to Ravinia (outdoor concerts) our childrens' soccer and baseball games, and camping. The chairs are wonderful. They fold flat to take in our cars. They open in a couple of seconds. Since they are aluminum, I expect that they will look good for years to come. We are very happy with the purchase."
5,sturdy and dependable,"I recommend this chair for those with weight issues ( i.e. 300 plus pounds). It is what you've been looking for. Mine has been in use for over 4 years and has had no mechanical breakdown issues whatsoever. This is the one you've been looking for if you're tired of tight, unsafe lawn chairs!!"
2,Not as good as I thought,"I read the review and thought this would be a pretty good movie. However, I was really disappointed when I viewed it. The plot started out pretty ok. It kepts one interested for a moment (at least for me), but then later the movie couldn't decide if it wants to be a comedy (which is not) or a mystery (which I solved pretty easily). The end of the movie is even worst because it nevers tells the audience what happens to the three characters. It just left me hanging (which I hate!)"
4,Good,I like the main actor. I know this movie is kind of old but I order it anyways. The quality of the DVD is not that good can't really see too much coloring but overall its ok. The shipping was pretty fast.
4,12V is A-OK,"There was a time when a 9.6 volt was all the rage - We are well beyond that now, but the 12V is just fine for general construction, although not the best for installing deck screws all day; but not even the 18V is going keep up with that task. The best part about the 12V is lightness and maneuverability. It also fits well in a belt holster, because the weight of the battery does not pull the drill out."
2,Max Lucado you are special dvd,"I search closed-captioned(CC) for deaf childrens & teens at deaf christian school & camp. I found dvd for closed-caption and ordered it. I frustration of no subtitle for CC. ...Why it said: Format: Animated, ""Closed-captioned"", Color, Dolby, DVD-Video, Full Screen, Subtitled, NTSC Need Closed-aptioned (CC) for deaf education"
4,Lots of Action,"A lot of things are going on in this volume but not much actually happens. The characters are in a brand new situation and the audience is getting to see brand new reactions from them. Now the audience is seeing what the characters would do in a brand new life threatening situation while we work our way towards the next big opponent. The action on this volume is strong but to be honest, I'm much more interested in seeing what is going to happen on the next volume with Uryo and Orihime. In other words, I enjoyed this volume but I didn't feel like I gained a lot of ground in terms of the story. Recommended for fans."
2,They send the wrong package,"I ordered the ClipArt & More 3 Million because it comes with a year subscription to [...]. I received ClipArt & More 3.5 Million which comes with a year subscription to [...]. These are two distinctly different online clip art services. In my opinion, [...] is superior to [...]. It wasn't worth the hassle to send it back. It really irritates me when I receive a substitute."
2,Oldschool,This is a really old book.It's got some funny little bits and pieces in it.Don't buy it because of it's title.The title would apply about 70 years ago or so.It's pretty outdated. My favorite part is at the end when it lists wrestling injuries and how to cure them.
4,Older movie full of unexpected twists!,One of My Wives is Missing - This is an older movie but full of lots of unexpected twists and turns! It will keep you guessing!
3,Living legend,"This is Jack.Thank you for the availability of this book.Full of pics, some are really historical pictures."
5,Horse lovers,If you love horses this is the toy for you. This horse toy is the best toy horse you could every buy! They can bend there legs and they even have Saddle Bags.
5,Great,this toy is so cool i think horse lovers will mostly love this toy or just barbie fans too this toy is a good toy for anyone
2,McFarlane Toys,Not crazy about this particular series. Only Mary Slaughter and Bethany Bled are worth buying.
5,Oz: The Magical Adventure,"My daughter (4 1/2) absolutely loved this cd-rom. She sat for over an hour the first time having so much fun. She wouldn't stop until she collected all the gems and was able to rescue Dorothy in Emerald city! She was problem-solving, sequencing, doing maizes and improving her thinking skills and she did't even know it! There are 3 difficulty levels (she started on easy), so she will be able to play this one for a long time. All her favorites- the scarecrow, the tinman, the lion and of course the yellow brick road! This is the best and most creative/educational cd-rom I've seen. I'm going to buy several and give them for all the 5 year birthday parties coming up!"
5,The Donigans,"All I can say is, ""Thank you Amazon,"" for offering such a great product at such a great savings. My husband and I researched the net and stores thoroughly before purchasing this equipment. What we found was that we could save several hundred dollars by going through amazon.com. We love our new system simply because it is everything that we were promised that it was and more."
4,RN,I have been a long time fan of Bose systems. I am extremely pleased with this product. I will hopefully always have a Bose system of my entertainment system.
2,flimsy game that fell apart as soon as used,plastic piping that formed the frame of this stand-up game didn't hold the game up in order to play the bean bag toss. i called them and they weren't helpful at all :[ it went in the trash after one attempted game of bean bag toss!
4,Needs muscle to put together but fun to play,This has been used at most parties I throw at my house for my 2 kids and has been taken to school for parties there. Initially it's a puzzle figuring out how the fabric piece with pockets will fit the frame (it seems too small) but you have to really push the PVC parts together before the frame is small enough to have the fabric piece velcro on. It usually takes someone with some muscle. It holds up great for play and is a lot of fun.
2,Biggest Loser,"Not a workout CD, just a song collection. Not constant tempo. Not very inspiring/motivating songs. Buy this because you like the songs, not because you want something to exercise to. I was going to use it for my class, but after hearing song samples, put it back on the shelf."
5,Beautiful!,"The ring arrived in perfect condition, and it even has an elaborate stamp on the back. I love it!"
3,Not like Before,"The story is the same and the illustrations are the same, but this book is not like it was before. I am terribly disappointed to find that it is printed and bound in China. Thanks to the look inside feature, I can now screen the country of origin before I buy another book. God Bless America."
4,Pop up!,Great product as usual. Love the colors and great for the office. I really like the post it products. I would buy again.
3,Nothing special,"Nothing special but does the job. Also, it states on the packaging that the GB's are hollow, then on the internet it says solid, then on the same packaging it says solid so it takes awhile to just get them and see for yourself."
5,good stuff!,I got what I expected without any problems. This product is great for soft toss. Hitting a small ball then going to a regular size baseball really helps my hitting. It makes baseballs look like beachballs.
5,WOW!!!,"This is a fantastic little Christmas album! Too bad there are only 4 songs - it leaves you wanting more. Clay's vocals are absolutely gorgeous. The arrangements are beautiful, but don't overpower the stellar vocals. The only mistake? Limiting the number of copies available."
5,Beautiful!,"Love all the songs, but I bought it for ""All is Well, and ""Emanuel."" Surprisingly, I really like his take on ""My Grown up Christmas List."" The first time I heard that song was by Kelly Clarkson and I loved the way she sang it. Now I love it by Clay too. I would highly recommend this cd, but you won't be able to get it. It's all sold out. My sister heard mine and wanted it. I went back to the Walmart and they were gone."
1,A Travesty,"I have written a review of Book 1 of Athenaze, and suffice to say that Book 2 carries all the deficiencies and dangers of its predecessor, but carries them further, because the poor student who is learning from Athenaze has been given such a shakey foundation. The Greek is still given out piecemeal and chopped up, as in Book 1, and as there, it still makes more confusing a language which is already complicated enough. The appendix and charts here are no more helpful here than they were in Book 1, and again there is too much emphasis on illustrations and ""relevance"" over clarity and fullness of explanation. This book is an abysmal failure, and damages the poor students upon whom it is inflicted (amongst whom I was one). I despise it and cannot tell against it strongly enough. What a shame I cannot give it zero stars!"
2,Warning: This book will self-destruct your intelligence,"Aside from the grossly historically inacurate translations, the grammer is introduced backwards. THe book gives you a translation with something new and expects you to guess the rule for the rest of that section. After the translation is done, then the new grammer is introduced. I'm taking Greek I in college right now and every body in the class is failing because the book is incomprehensible."
2,Demeaning and Confusion,"This is my first year of ancient Greek, and though I can't say it has been deplorable, it certainly has been less than interesting. This is due in no small part to our text, Athenaze. I and my classmates find the stories about Dicaeopolis and his family, although humorous, puerile and insulting. The exercises are repetitive to the point of being monotonous, and the layout of the grammar notes leaves something to be desired. Seeing as I have nothing to compare this book to, it might be the best book for Ancient Greek, but I and the Classics department head (who is not teaching the course) agrees with me when I say I doubt it."
3,"An acceptable intro to Greek, but not the best","My university uses ATHENAZE books 1 and 2 to teach beginning Greek, which is fine when you have professors who love to teach grammar and drill people. The book immerses students in the language and the stories they write are engaging, but the order they present material in is somewhat confusing and you don't learn the grammar just by reading about it in the book. If your professor enjoys reading the grammar pages to you, instead of trying to relate them in other ways, you may want to look into getting a second text."
2,"Athenaze: An Introduction to Ancient Greek, Vol. 2",As Greek text books go this one isn't the best to use when learning on your own out side of lecture but it's not the worst. Definitly recomend the work book that accompanies this text.
3,It seems complete and similar to Henle Latin,"I just purchased the handbook and workbook both 2003, 2nd edition.....Workbook looks complete and answers in the back, my only complaint so far was the condition that it came in - all marked with pen and answers from previous owner. Book reminds me of the Henle Latin series that we also use. I have found that to use the student book you do need the teacher's book and you cannot find it, so I have twice called Oxford University Press to get the teacher's book, they will get back to me. You can use the workbook and it was worth the purchase, however if you want to use the student book in it's entirety you do need the teacher's book.... So batting 500 for this series of books so far..."
1,"ordered Vol II, but got Vol I","I ordered Volume 2, but we were shipped volume 1 !!!What are my options now?Do I have to pay frt to return this?Could send someone send me a call tag?thnks,Laura"
1,I'd give it zero stars if that option were available,"Both volumes of _Athenaze_ are terrible. Our entire first year (and 1st semester of 2nd year) Greek class hated it. It's organized very poorly; e.g., all the principal parts of a verb are not presented at once, in a mistaken belief that it's easier to memorize them piecemeal. It isn't, it's very confusing. Also, the stories in each chapter are terrible, really uninspiring. At some point in the second volume they paraphrase a bit of Herodotus. It was so dull that I avoided Herodotus as long as I could. When finally confronted with the real thing, I was amazed at how great Herodotus was and appalled at Balme and Lawall's shoddy retelling. In short, this text book (both volumes of it) is great only if you want to discourage a student from studying Ancient Greek."
2,Ok along with other books and a good tutor,"This book is good as long as you also buy Workbook I and another grammar book and have a tutor who can fix all the trick questions they ask. It is designed to not give you all the answers and force you to think (get frustrated) and then ask the teacher. If you're brilliant you can figure out some of their trick questions by looking in the back or a chapter or two ahead. There are no answers to any of the exercises, so if you're doing a self-study without a tutor good luck figuring out if you answered correctly.If you have the time to devote to it, get Workbook I (which does have the answers)and have a tutor to help explain the answers to the trick questions, and have a complementary and better grammar book you can refer to,then this is a really good book; but by itself- nada.Of course, you could also just buy the teacher's version and get every execise correct... :)"
2,"Too difficult, too early","I am studying for Greek GCSE in England, and Athenaze II becomes very difficult after the relative simplicity of book I; around chapters 18/19, the grammar diverges from the syllabus and covers many irrelevant topics which may be of use to American students, but the UK edition is really still geared to the US course (it certainly isn't appropriate in large chunks of grammar and vocab for UK courses).Book I is extremely useful to those starting to learn ancient Greek, however book II is likely to provide quite a shock to those thinking it is of a similar difficulty to book I: it hikes up the level of comprehension and grammar needed very quickly and to the student's disadvantage. Many segments of grammar are far too complicated for the age range at which Athenaze II is aimed, and some are just totally unnecessary, and serve only to complicate the language.The difficulty of book II could quite possibly put students off continuing with their Greek courses."
5,Great Book to Begin Learning Greek,"I had this book as my College Greek text. As explained by my teacher it is an inductive learning text, this is different from traditional texts in that it allows you to learn the language as you learned english. (i.e. you learn how to use the passive voice, or the participle, or the plu-perfect before you could name them -- or pick them out of a line-up. . . so to speak). I found it was very helpful and I am now purchasing the book to review in my post graduate years. A very good text if you are brushing up on Greek, or if you are learning with a friend who knows Greek; but learning it from scratch on your own would be difficult with any book."
2,Good Seller but Movie not Good,"Seller of this DVD is great and received the movie at the promised time but the movie in itself is not great for any age group looks like this movie was made in hurry and seems to cover all chapters in clippings of a minute or two.Would not recommend for any age group,gave two stars for the sellers but the product in itself is not great"
3,Ramayana,"Its a Very good portrayal of Lord Rama,from indian mythology, and his life as a child and his life in the city of Ayodhya and also of His adventures. Deeply Religious as well as educational for the youth."
3,The Laws of Lifetime Growth,"After studying much of Dan Sullivan's work over the last few years, I genuinely think he's a genius and a masterful teacher. Unfortunately, this book didn't communicate as well as his other works. I therefore recommend readers buy this book as well as his other materials from The Strategic Coach progam. His insight and teachings have helped me significantly increase my income while improving my quality of life and free time."
4,"Good idea. Down-to-earth writing. Perhaps, a bit too much so.","The 10 Laws of Lifetime Growth is OK. Yet, there are many much better alternatives out there. For example, try Michael Ray's ""The Highest Goal"" instead. Sullivan and Nomura's overly simplistic writing style does not serve the purpose very well, at least in this particular instance. In addition, the numerous trademarked references turn the book into a kind of an oversized sales brochure for The Strategic Coach."
5,Good Book for Anyone,"I had to read this book for a school assignment. However, I found the book to be quite helpful and applicable to life, both professional and personal. The laws are pretty straightforward (always make your questions greater than your answers, etc.), but they bring up some intersting stories and applications of these laws and how to apply the laws to life. I'll probably read this again more thoroughly after I write the paper on it."
2,10 Reasons Not To Read This Book,"As a fan of Dan Sullivan's work, I was excited about the release of his new book. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. I thought the writing was flat and hard to follow. The advice was helpful, but it seemed derivative of other self-help books I've read. It seems like Sullivan simply read these other books and put together their best ideas into his book. So there is nothing really new here. I believe he is trying to help people, but I think he needs to be more original in his thinking, or at least acknowledge the sources of his ideas. I look forward to better work from him next time."
3,Nothing New Here just a Different Format,I had only heard about the Author and his company before running across this book. I was disappointed in the book. It is okay but mostly his 'laws' are redone from many writers before him. Seemed to me to be more promo for his company and his work and I guess that is okay. He is successful with his company so he is doing something right but didnt resonate with me.
3,The laws about this book,"The Laws of Lifetime growthThis is a very quick read. The laws may be things that you already intrinsically do or quite possibly could be areas where you need improvement. Each chapter provides a brief and thought provoking introduction to the law, and ends with two questions to move you toward fully realizing the law.Here are the laws:1. Always make your future bugger than your past2. Always make your learning greater than your experience3. Always make your contribution bigger than your reward4. Always make your performance greater then your applause5. Always make you gratitude greater then you success6. Always make your enjoyment greater than your effort7. Always make your cooperation greater than your status8. Always make you confidence greater than your comfort"
2,Hawk call,I was very excited at first to get this hawk call. It doesn't work very well or sound like a hawk. It's sitting on my dashboard in my truck...sometimes I use it during rush hour traffic to annoy annoying drivers...save your money!
2,A mildly amusing but unremarkable satire.,I was disappointed. I was hoping for a harder hitting futuristic satire; what I got was a lightweight story with mostly uninteresting characters. Perhaps if you are really into advertising and marketing the novel is worthwhile. For the average casual reader I would say skip this one.
3,Very short cord,I have never seen a hair appliance with such a short cord. I can barely get it to my hair while using a mirror. My hair dryer has a cord that is 3 feet longer!
1,Chupacabras??????,"Simply awfull. I couldn't even finish it. I kept slogging through it even after I read chupacabra (all I could think of was that X-File episode) but there was just no way I could get through the whole thing. (I ordered this book because it was rated with 4 1/2 stars, what a mistake!)"
4,"Not as good as the first, but still enjoyable","Seduced by the Night, the sequel to Out of the Night features Dirk, a character from the authors first book and Bethany, his destined lady love. Dirk is a changeling, half human, half vampire and Bethany is a biochemist that has to be guarded by Dirk from the vampires that are pursuing her. I enjoyed the plot even though it was a little more predictable than Out of the Night. There was a return of previous characters from the first book, and I always like to see the old characters make a cameo. This book wasn't as dark or suspensful as the first book, but still very good. This book falls more into the paranormal romance genre than the first one did, but I still enjoyed the heck out of it."
4,Good Design,"Holds mud and water well when getting in during bad weather. Only flaw is that the rubber tends to stain, that is the only reason that I only gave a 4 star"
1,Defective Sony TV,"Although this Sony model is no longer available, anyone considering buying a used one should know that this television has an inherent defect with the Optical Block or Light Engine. Those of us who purchased this TV in 2005 are now getting deeply discounted replacements from Sony. There have been several class action lawsuits as well as local small claims litigation. It appears that the Optical Block was defective from the introduction and is a $1500.00 repair. The repairs are repeating every 3 to 5 years. Sony did not update or correct this problem. It was a great tv when it worked correctly."
5,GREAT STORY LINE+GAMEPLAY!!!,"Great storyline and gameplay, ok graphics sound and music but good enough!This game is adventurious and kicks!I reccomend this game to any starwars gamer!:)(very low system requirmenst!):)"
3,bad graphics,The gameplay is fun put you would beat it pritty fast because i think it is easy but you might not. the graphics are horrible that why i gave it a 3-star rating. i think the game was okay.
3,"Overall, It's an okay game","I think that this game is okay. The good things are that it is action- packed and the cutscenes are cool. The bad things: horrible, horrible, horrible graphics. The game's graphics make the game look like it was made in the 1800s. the A.I. is kind of weak, too. I read the reviews here before i bought the game ... I was really surprised by the graphics. In conclusion, I would save up my money for a better Star Wars game like ""Galactic Battlegrounds"" or ""The Phantom Menace""."
2,Disappointment....,"Huh, probably most reviewers won't agree with me on this one, but I found this game extremely boring. I'm a Star Wars fan, so I can appreciate everything w/ a good story, decent visual, etc. I know this game is fairly old, but I still play old games (even ones from the early '90-s), so old graphics really don't disturb me that much. But the storyline should be MUCH better, that DF2's: I never felt any interest in the game, playing it was almost like playing Quake 3 Arena: pointless.Acting is almost horrible in this one - they should've gone with graphical cut scenes inseat of live actors: acting is actually so bad that it hurts. Most of the B movies have better acting than in this game.I'd say avoid this game at all costs, unless you're a really big Lucasarts/Star Wars fan. I got the game for a bargain price but still feel fairly dissapointed."
5,I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT .,THIS IS DEFINTLY ONE OF MY FAVORITES. THE END CAME TO SOON I WANTED IT TO GO ON AND ON!!
2,Disappointed!,"What a disappointment! I always look forward to reading a new Danielle Steel novel, but I have to say -- this one was not up to her usual standards. Charlie is so sappy that I don't blame his wife for choosing an old man. He whined and ""cried"" throughout the entire book. Ms. Steel should have stuck with the story of Sarah and Francois -- it was the only reason I finished the book."
2,so so,"I am a big fan of Danielle Steel and have loved so many of her books,so this really surprised me. I honestly couldn't stand the ""hero"" Charlie. He drove me crazy!! I thought he was so wimpy. I had no respect for this guy halfway through the book.. I found it hard to believe any woman would really be interested in him. Was it not for the introduction of the story between Sarah and Francois, I would not have had any interest in finishing. Danielle should have just written a story about them,I loved their story."
4,Enjoyed it Thoroughly!,I am a great fan of Danielle Steels work and I really enjoyed reading this novel. I like how Sarah helped Charlie to get through his life and how she brought Francesca and Charlie together. It was interesting the way you kept going from the Journal readings to the present. Another well done piece of work.
5,A book that kept me up all night,"I'm an avid reader, and considerable critic. If the first 12 pages don't pull me out of my chair, I put it in the garage sale pile. :) But ""Ghost"" was one of the most exciting, surprising, informative, believable, page-turner I've read since Victoria Holt. I highly recommend it as long as you have a day or so to read it without putting it down. LOL"
5,LOVE THIS BOOK!!,"I can't begin to tell you how many times I've read this book. I love it. When I'm in the mood for an easy, wonderful, feel good book I always turn to Danielle Steel. She never disappoints me and The Ghost is no exception."
1,"Egad, what bad writing!","She can tell a good story, but she's writing too fast. Third person voice? Passive verbs? Past tense from start to finish and ALWAYS inside the guy's head. However, I didn't really get disgusted until I read, ""...homespun wooden cradle.."" What? Homespun is fabric -- what idiot editor let that one slip through? Because of this error and other really dumb actions, like driving a coach through a dark night on frontier dirt roads makes it obvious that neither she nor her editors know anything about the era. And, it would seem they don't really care about their reader's intelligence either."
4,Romance and Love transend the milleniums of time.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Danielle Steel is never disappointing. You get romance,intrigue, laughter, and sorrow spun into an unforgettable story."
5,Very pleased customer,"The book was in great condition, and was here sooner than I had anticipated. I am very pleased! And thanks for the opportunity to read this fantastic book!!!!!"
4,First time Steel reader and I look forward to more,"If someone hadn't given this book to me, then I would be clueless about Steel's books. She was able to capture two different time periods in such a smooth and captivating way. I must admit that I loved Sarah's story the best. The descriptions of Shellburne Falls, past and present, made me want to hop on a plane to see and feel such a place. I would absolutely recommend this book to someone, especially a first time Danielle Steel reader like me."
3,Recommended For Danielle Steel Fans - Probably Not For Anyone Else,"This book was a little off-beat for Danielle Steel, and involves a lonely man, a female ghost in his rented cabin, and the real-life woman who changes his life.This is very light and enjoyable popcorn reading, good if you have a few hours to waste. Unique to this book is the fact that it's written entirely from the perspective of a male character, instead of Steel's customary female heroines."
2,Interruptions,"Was this book edited?! Too many run on sentences for me, I could barely follow the story because I was so blown away by the errors. The amount of sentences that began with AND or BUT were too many for me, it was distracting. This is the first D.S. book I've read and I would like to read more but if this the case all of the time, I'll pass."
3,Sweet lovestory(easy to forget),The ghost is all right a but not very remarkable at all. It is just the normal bestselling type. But if you are an teenager you'll like this sweet litle lovestory. Charles Watston is the only good person and saves the book.
3,Steel Not At Her Best!,This book was different than most of Steel's. It was too fairy tale like and not very realistic. It was definitley a bad writing week for Steel. This book just doesn't do her justice.
3,Two stories in one,"I am not a die-hard fan of Danielle Steel, but I have read a number of her books. This title drew me to the book. A few of my friends stated it was not that good of a read, but the title kept drawing me back until finally I checked it out. An interesting present day story that moves rather slowly and Charlie's woes began to grind on my nerves, but I remained interested. I wondered how the author was going to pull the present-day story and the story from the past together, but she did. The result was worth the wait and I thoroughly enjoyed the story from the past. A nice comfortable book; worth the repetitious saga of Charlie in the beginning."
5,Awesome,Could not put this book down! I was hooked from the very first page! Danielle Steele once again does an awesome job and really knows how to keep you interested!
3,This is one of STEEL's best books.,"An ageless love story that will bring hope, joy, and faith that love transcends time. A very good story to take your mind somewhere else for awhile."
1,YUCK!,"This is the first Danielle Steel book I've read, and it will be the last for sure! It was so boring that I had a hard time even getting from page to page. If you want a good love story set in the past read the Outlander Series by Diana Gabaldon. Those books are excellent and keep you interested through over 3500 pages! Don't bother with Danielle Steel though...she sucks."
3,So-So.,"This book was way too historical for me. It bounced back and forth from past to present. I hate books like this. It was OK, but not one of the best. I was so bored with this one that I took forever to read it. Some parts were OK but I was lost half the time!!!!"
2,"A no-brainer, poorly written, poorly edited book","I usually stay away from cheesy novels, but after some heavy reading decided to try this. I was frustrated through much of the book with the inconsistencies of characters and places. I couldn't help thinking that Ms. Steel just ""whipped this one out"" and didn't bother to re-read or edit her own creation, nor did anyone else. The plot was interesting, yet predictable. This was not worth my Sunday."
3,And and and and and and so on,"I agree with one of the previous reviewers, I have noticed the ""and this and that"" throughout all of Danielle Steele's books. I don't read Danielle Steele very often. A friend of mine loaned me this book and it wasn't bad. I did enjoy Sarah's story much more than Charlie's. I'd say Sarah's story was a 4 and Charlie's a 2. I also felt that Ms. Steele went too in depth into Charlie's life with his ex-wife and their feelings for eachother and how hurt Charlie was. Get over it! She left him for an OLD man! If that wasn't in the story, I felt it could have been much better."
2,Beautiful and Hypnotic 5 STARS!!! (goofed rating above),"5 STARS plus!!!!!! My new favorite CD!! Soothing, unique, beautifully hypnotic and a wonderful source of artistic inspiration as I paint in watercolor. Our dogs even love it and fall asleep as soon as I put it on!Next time I go to the massage therapist I'm taking this CD with me to have it played - perfect CD for massages. Great CD to help relax with on sleepless nights.You won't be disappointed by this CD, and it will surely be a ""lifer"" in your CD collection. Enjoy!"
4,"Soporific, but in a good way","Not much to say about this one. Very pleasant, almost homogenized, and nothing jarring. Good for sleep, meditation, a background for work, or general ambiance. This is not to belittle it; many artists cannot achieve even this much."
2,Functions didn't work,"We got this from Santa and the ""drill"" functions don't work whatsoever. Was a total bummer because the other reviews were so great. I had been looking forward to my daughter using this toy as she needs some math practice. Now I have to figure out the return issue because it can't be purchased anywhere locally."
4,Easy to use and educational,"I bought this for my five year old nephew who is already attempting to do multiplication. He loves it and figured out how to use it right when I put the batteries in. It isn't ""fun"" in the conventional way but he loves learning so it was fun to him. He does keep putting it on level 8 which is way too difficult for him (135+___=196) but the lower levels keep him entertained and it will be something he can use for a while and grow into it. Highly suggest for someone who enjoys learning. It doesn't make learning fun but if they enjoy math anyway, it would be great for them."
1,Educational Insights Math Whiz,"We are not impressed with the product. As answers are being entered into the math whiz it will sometimes incorrectly buzz on the correct answers. Also, if the machine is bumped slightly the buzz sound will come on and count the answer incorrect when nothing has been entered."
5,Nice as a calculator,"My 8 year old hasn't played with it too much, it is a nice math toy though. And a very nice calculator for mom to use."
3,As advertised...,Expected more from the product but it functions as advertised. Wish it was more engaging to keep the attention and focus of an eight-year old.
1,Does not work at all.,"I put this away for a Christmas present and I got so busy I never checked to see if it worked. It was opened on Christmas ,we installed brand new duracell batteries and it did'nt even light up. What a dissapointment . Needless to say I am still searching for my receipt. If it did work I would have given it 2 stars anyway because it is very, very cheaply made. The thing that gets me most is inside the battery compartment there is a little sticker saying it passed inspection. Now I am out the money and my child was dissapointed.."
4,"Good Value for Money, but Math Shark is Better","I have an 8 year old and an 11 year old. I ordered this and the Math Shark. The Shark is about twice as much, but both of my children prefer the Shark. The Shark appears to be more challenging and cover a wider range of problems. If your child is over 10 I would choose the Shark. If not, this is a good value. I give this 4 stars because of the value proposition. The Shark would get a 5 star rating."
2,"Great, when it works","We bought the Math Wiz on Feb. 1st, 2008. It worked just fine at first and our 1st grader enjoyed using the Math Wiz on occasion. This isn't a toy, but really an electronic device for learning basic math factors.What disappoints us is that after 6-8 months, the Math Wiz stopped working properly. At this point, the only thing we can get it to do is work like a basic calculator. The challenges and timed exercises do not function at all. It was never abused or dropped and still looks brand new. The thing just stopped working right all of a sudden, and now it appears I'm stuck with it in this condition."
5,Great toy for building math skills!,"""Toy"" and ""math"" are two words that don't usually appear in the same sentence. My 7 year old enjoys this gadget. It gives positive feedback during the quiz games. It's shaped like a hand held video game, so that raises the ""cool factor"" in her mind. And since it also doubles as a calculator as well, it can serve double duty when needed.I would recommend this educational toy!"
3,Not that great.,"I had an electronic owl/calcultor about 30 years ago that I liked better than this. I was hoping it would be interesting enough to my kids they'd want to play it, but nope, to predictable. It's not fun for them. It does have many functions, but it's too boring in it's games."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This toy might be good if we still lived in 1980. I didn't expect but so much, but I expected more than I got. My niece won't even play with it because she doesn't understand it or either she just doesn't enjoy it. Don't waste your money."
2,A lot of money for what you get.,I believe that this item is overpriced for what you get. There are better educational tooling for children out there.
1,Despicable!,"This machine doesn't have nearly the amount of functions I was expecting! How can I calculate vectors when there aren't even trig functions!This is the reason American children can't compete on a global marketplace. This ""tool"" of education is more of a tool for procrastination for the American public. L'Hopital would turn in his grave! Newton would have an aneurysm!Such simplistic mathematics is best left to those whom the toy's description excludes - three year olds and below.For just a slight amount more, you could get an old yet durable graphing utility which would increase the amount you could teach your child by a factor of 10!In conclusion, there isn't enough here to warrant a buy. If I can't calculate a vector with it, it's rubbish."
1,Tried twice and both failed to function within days,"My wife and I had a Math Professor from TI for our children when they were young. It lasted year after year after year and was finally passed on to another family. However, Math Wiz's screen was hard to read and we tried two units, both of which failed within a short time. Very, very disappointing device."
2,Math Whiz,"This product quit working after only a couple of weeks. I tried new batteries, but it would not work. I couldn't remember where I ordered it, so I called the company. They were supposed to send me a new one, but I never recieved it. I still have the broken one. I was very dissappointed. I must have gotten a lemon!"
4,Fun with Math!!!,"This has been great for my special needs son to work on his math. The colored key pad, the touch, the durability and the size - all help us get through the homework a little easier."
3,Doesn't work perfectly,"Just received the Math Whiz today. Purchased it as a present for my 9 year old. The different levels of difficulty offered are great - the higher levels are a definite challenge, even for an adult. The disappointment is that the ""Clear"" function doesn't work except in Calculator mode, so the machine has to be turned off and then back on if you want to change to another mode. Not a big deal, so we won't be returning it, unless something else goes wrong."
4,Good product,"It is a well thought out product but our 8yr old daughter lost interest in it pretty quick, I'm sure it would be a better fit for other children though."
1,Math Whiz,This item stopped working shortly after we began using it and it was not abused. The display was no longer visible after about 2 months. It was a waste of money.
2,Not worth it...,"I wanted to like this, and I went into the purchase with low expectations given some of the other reviews. I tried it out when I got it out of the package and found the screen incredibly hard to read. Overall, it seemed to be made okay, but the screen was a deal breaker. The buttons were a bit hard to press, but not outrageous. I returned it that day. Back to the drawing board, hoping to find something with a few bells and whistles to make multiplication practice a little less boring."
1,Don't waste your money!,"The 3 button stopped working after minimal uses, so it was useless because you can't skip question. So when it got to a question with a 3 my daughter couldn't use it. Total waste of money and such a dissappointment because I really would have loved a game for my daughter to improve her math skills in a fun way!"
3,Like it when it works,This is a good little devise. It has a tendency of freezing up if you answer to fast or hit two buttons at the same time. I either wait until it unfreezes or have to pull the batteries to get it to reset. Other than that it is exactly what I was looking for for my kids.
2,Not what I ordered,"I selected this shirt to be in an X, and it came in a XX. Also, the material is very thick, and it wouldn't seem very wearable in the southern summer climate."
1,Fiction,"I find all of these ""responces"" to Dan browns book to be ludicris! The Davinci Code is a novel people, a work of fiction. If it causes anyone to investigate history, art, or heven forbid their faith, that is terrific! The more educated you are about religion, it's history, art, and world influence, the better armed you will become against those who will try to sell fiction as fact. Mr. Brown has not tried to sell his story as fact, rather he call what he has written a ""novel"" a work of fiction. Please do your homework before buying anyone's stories as fact, even if it is your pastor/priest/rabbi/mulla 's story."
3,great effects,"storyline is only mildly engaging. The special effects saved it. My wife and daughter like the Thor character, go figure."
5,All time fave!,"It was an action packed, well written fun family friendly movie which captured the whole concept of the comic book of Avengers."
5,Very Entertaining,I really enjoyed it. Starts a little slow but makes up for it in the end. Surprised me with some funny lines between the characters. I will definitely watch again.
4,"Movie is a 5 for sure, everything else is nothing special","First and foremost, the movie is incredible.Without a doubt, probably the best comic book movie adaptation.That is saying a lot considering the Dark Knight's success.But I see the Dark Knight as a very well done crime drama that happensto have a popular super hero.In Marvel Avengers, you get all the super hero trappings from beginning to end.I enjoyed it very much so for that, I give it all the stars that I could give.What I was disappointed in was the process involved with downloading the sound track as pointed out by fellow reviewers. That's really uncalled for. I also don't like how weak the featurette was. It's just a few interviews with some cast members and very few behind the scenes footage. I can only compare this to other films from the same core franchise when they released their home video units.Bottom line, if all you want is the film, by all means for the price, it's well worth it. Just don't expect a whole lot more."
5,The Avengers rule!,"This dvd is an above par film that I enjoyed completly. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and the Incredible Hulk are all in this. Loki comes to get what is being called the Tesaract. Loki enlists the aid of some nasty aliens to boot. Iron Man rocks and the Incredible Hulk steals the show. If you like comic books then you'll love this. Scarlet Johannson plays black widow and she does an excellent job of that too. I highly recommend this to kids and adults alike. If you enjoy fantasy and science fiction then you'll like this."
5,love it,"can hardly wait for the next one to come out, this had a lot of action in it and was very entertaining."
4,Good flik,"A little slow to get started. My kids love it. Ironman's humor makes the movie IMO. If you're a fan of the Ironman movies or Captain America, you'll like this one."
2,HD not very HD,HD quality was lacking. Movie was good but 4.99 for poor HD quality is disappointing. I thought it was my internet but HD on netflix worked fine.
5,Great movie!,I'm a huge Marvel and Joss Wheden fan and this movie didn't disappoint! I can't wait for the next one!
5,"Great product, fast shipping!","I bought this months ago and I have to say the $19.99 price i got this for is the best I have seen since it was released so i am very pleased by that! Also shipping was WAY ahead of schedule! Awesome movie, awesome shipping! Amazon is the best at what they do!"
5,Iron Man Makes it,"This movie is great and has a lot of positives for Avengers fans. However, I totally think that without iron man this movie would have been crappy."
5,Great Movie,First off - this is a great movie. Everything from the characters to the plot to the graphics is great. I love the combo pack because of the versatility and I didnt realize until after I had given this to my fiance that this also came with a digital music download. Just one of those awesome perks. This was definitely the best deal out there for this movie.
5,"Marvel's ""The Dark Knight""","I have to say although admittedly I loved The Dark Knight Rises a bit more I did enjoy this Marvel film and I firmly believe The Avengers is the best film to come out of Marvel comics. I think Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Hiddelson were the best parts of the whole movie. Found myself completely cheering on the action, laughing at the funny parts. I can't wait for the sequel to come out."
4,Good Movie!,"I had a little problem getting into the first 20 minutes, but once I did, I loved the movie. I watched it a second time and the first 20 minutes were enjoyable as well! I'd watch it again tonite if I still had it!"
4,Great movie and great way to watch,"The Avengers is a great action movie based on favorite comic book heroes. Amazon instant video is a great way to watch, easy delivery via the Internet, low cost, great quality. We watched using Amazon App on a Roku unit on a HD TV.Cheers, Bill"
4,A great movie with serious flaws...,"Not going to add spoilers here, but once you watch this it will leave anyone who is a true fan saying to them selves ""Awesome movie.....but why this and why that and they shouldn't have done that and this is wrong, etc."""
5,"Good movie, action and fiction. Good service","Good movie, action and fiction. Good service, Good movie, action and fiction. Good service.Good movie, action and fiction. Good service"
3,Fun,"Its action packed and fun, but not enough background for me but if you like nonstop action this is the film"
3,Aspect Ration is old 1.85:1,for the latest movie I expected it to match my theater aspect ration full CinemaScope 2.35:1 aspect ratio as all new movies are released in that format.Now I have to live with the cropped version
3,marvel avengers,"I was expecting more, story was slow and drawn out. The action really did not start until at least half way through the movie. It was ok."
4,Avengers assemble!,Until now each of the movies have been about only individual heros but now they team up. Joining forces to fight the evil Loki and prevent the destruction of the earth. They need to figure out how to work together and what Loki is up to and how to stop it. The credits contain some revealing details about a possible sequel.
4,great movie,I am 62 years old and i loved the movie. Fast paced and funny. I think anyoneyoung or old would like it.
4,Marvel's The Avengers,"Marvel's The Avengers 5/5 OK Now you know what I think about the movie and thats all you need to know.Now for the blu-ray the picture and sound is good as expected.The special features are a little dissaponitment.The good:Joss Wendon commentary, just himDeleted scenesGag reelmusic video, just oneThe bad:featurettes 14 minutes of it.Marvel one shot, I expected more form it.I haven't seen or know what the second screen is. So thats my review."
5,Blown away,"their are no words to describe how good this movie is. yup it that good, so rent and/or buy it already!"
5,Avengers,"Fun movie, enjoyed watching on my Kindle while on plane flight. Watched again next night w/husband.We both have not seen Thor, decided we will watch that next. Good movie for evening in just kicking back."
4,It's Marvel!,Marvel has a way of turning cartoons/comics into something quite entertaining and this was done pretty well.I'm looking forward to a part 2!
3,Entertaining light movie,on demand service works great. good easy movie and some tie-ins to the other Marvel movies and stories. couple of funny scenes.
4,Great Movie.,Not as good as the first 2 of iron man but worth the money. The scenes are awesome and the soundtrack rocks
3,So-so,"This film kept me wishing for a little something above the 12 year-old level.As a ""big person"" I have to say it was not especially satisfying."
4,Good watch,"Very entertaining!! However, it got so cheesy sometimes that I did not like it. I thought that it was great that they were able to keep the cast for each character. The first time I watched this, I had not seen all of the movies (like Captain America or Thor). Watching those and then watching this movie made it much more enjoyable!"
4,Amazing avengers,"It was entertaining, exciting and will keep me looking forward to the next installment. I will nw rent Thor and captain america"
2,Video quality,The Video quality was bad.We love the movie. but would like to have a better picture.thank you very much. one more word.
1,"misleading, confusing.","I'm confused. I bought the simple Avengers single DVD because I don't own ""blu-ray"" and don't care to. The whole point of buying DVDs, among my social network anyway, is to have access to deleted scenes and special features, outtakes and such. The plain DVD has none of that, just commentary. As far as I can tell, if you can't afford and don't care to own a ""blu-ray"" player, you don't have any way of buying or having any access to the deleted scenes or outtakes. So now I'm stuck with this DVD of this movie I've already seen enough times, it's great and all but not worth $20 if it's just the same thing I already saw in the theatre. I'm really disappointed and confused and sad."
4,"well worth watching, if...","... you're into comic book-based flicks. It nicely pulls together story lines from previous films (Ironman, Thor, Hulk), adds some new characters (that need more development) and provides a base for additional material. Give the current level of character development, a lot will depend on keeping the cast together."
5,Marvel's The Avengers,Absolutely awesome! The movie got here exactly when it was supposed to and the movie is one of the best.
4,Pretty good!,"Movie was entertaining. All in all, You have to know what you're getting. Not Oscar worthy but good. I would recommend it."
2,Price cut on four-disc version trumps this version!,"What burns me about this order is that the price dropped on the deluxe set AFTER I pre-ordered this version; the four disc deluxe version with digital copy dropped its price to the point that it was only about 2 dollars more, and I had already ordered this 2 disc version! Needless to say, I WON'T be pre-ordering again; I'll wait for the price drop that I got screwed on!"
3,Tv,"Seemed like a tv series no real gut surprise. Getting to be a little tiring, throw some stuff on the screen and see what happens to much not tied togeather. To much of the same things."
3,It was okay..,"It seems that as more and more Marvel stories are made into movies, it goes further down hill. I expected a lot more."
3,"Action great, but",This is action packed but there is very little plot. Too bad. Kids will like it but adults probably not.
2,I don't get it,"I really do not understand the big deal about this film. Yes, it was a big blockbuster with a ""great"" cast but this thing bored the heck out of me in theaters and on Amazon Instant video. Too much ego tripping going on in this film."
2,Too many heroes,"The biggest problem with movies like this is too many heroes all vying for screen time. I loved Thor, loved Captain America, and loved Iron Man. These heroes need to have their own movie."
4,Hooray for awesomeness!,"Dear Hollywood Execs, thank you for finally making Whedon a super star. Please continue to give him all the money.Yours fondly,Nerds"
3,Problem with Music Download,"While The Avengers is one of the best movies of the year, the rating is for the DVD. I don't own a blue ray player yet but I got this set because it wound up being only $3.00 more than the regular DVD plus it has the digital copy and the music. I'm disappointed that most of the features are only on blue ray. I tried to download the music using the code provided in the box but it downloads as a zip file that can't be opened by either iTunes or Windows Media Player. You also are supposed to get a free poster but you have to pay $3.95 for shipping."
5,Enjoyed it,"Some good stuff here. If you don't like superhero flicks, why would you like this? But if you do, this is one to get under your belt. Good action, decent story line, and not just a repeat of others...although there is some Transformers- aliens-invade earth stuff going on."
5,Amazing!,"This is one of the best action hero movies I've seen in a while. It is definitely action packed, the comedy is remarkable and who wouldn't want to spend a couple of hours just looking at Chris Hemsworth?!! A great movie. I would recommend it for anyone."
5,Pure entertainment,Extremely well done film and so easy to let yourself go and get caught up in the fantasy. Definitely worth having your own copy.
5,Best super hero movie ever,Best movie of the summer action all the way. Robert Downey is a great tony starkBlack widow is fantastic
3,It's OK,"I'm excited that this movie made nearly a billion dollars at the box office because it's not loaded with sex, vulgarity and raunch but I don't get what all the excitement is about. I rented the DVD and it was just as good as many other well done special effects movie. So, if you like fast action special effects with a touch of humor, you'll like Marvel's The Avengers. But don't expect anything extraordinary."
5,Amazing and Cheap,"I don't know what the price is now, but when I bought this product it was 20 dollars, and what a bargain! It is excellent, the movie itself is a masterpiece and the four disc set is so great because my mother has a 3D tv that I can watch the 3D blu-ray on (though otherwise that particular disc just sits in the package).Speaking of the package it is a really cool one, with a holographic cover that my bf will stare at for hours (he is easily amused) and it came crisp and clean.Lastly, the soundtrack downloaded perfectly and though I don't listen to it often, it was a nice addition, and for only 20 dollars! It was great, I really recommend this if the price is still so low."
4,This movie is excellent in 3D!,Saw at the theater in 2D and loved it! We thought we'd check it out in 3D at home and enjoyed it even more. Highly recommended.
5,AVENGERS,Great movie can't wait for the suitcase to come out in Spring of 2013. II never get tired of seeing neither do my kids.
4,Marvel at Marvel Charaters,Well done action flick on the MArvel charaters they are true to form and bigger than life/animation. If you enjoy super hero characters like Marvel you will enjoy this movie.
5,Super Super-Hero Movie,"After seeing The Avengers 5 times and still liking the movie, I finally purchased a copy. Before the first viewing, I couldn't imagine how a movie could use all those super heroes and do any justice to a decent storyline. After seeing the movie, I was impressed by the acting, writing, and the special effects. The editing of the film was superb. I would see it again (in fact, I have!), and I would invite my friends over for a movie night to see it together. The Avengers was a fun action film, full of surprises, and what is not to like about a happy ending?"
4,Pretty Good,"Love Marvel movies!!! :) Full of action and is was quite witty as well, lots of one liners. Robert Downey Jr. was great"
5,Great Movie!,"Anyone thinking about getting this version, do yourself a favor. Stop thinking and get it. You will not be sorry. It's a fantastic movie and looks great in all formats."
3,Not under the right classification.,Customer advertised under the description Marvel's The Avengers (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging). With a minor note in the product details says it only has the feature film. Very shady way to pawn off a blu-ray as a two disc combo when it only had the feature film. Disappointed.
1,Digital copy is not HD,"Great movie but about this BlueRay combo I just can say disappointing. To download the movie you need a DVD drive in your computer/mac and then what you get is just the low resolution version of the movie. Again, not worth it."
1,Looong Clunker,"This movie is indeed a bloated and long clunker. The script and the story (is there even a story here?) don't make any sense. It's one of those movies that 30 minutes after watching it, you don't even remember what it was about. If one wants to say something good about the movie, at least one can point out that for a while it's fun watching a number of good actors (Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, etc) playing it for laughs. On the other hand, it is hard not end up annoyed by watching so many good actors wasting their talents with a very mediocre script."
5,Advengers,"Best movie ever! I loved it in the movie thearter and it was great to have at home and watch it whenever I want. All the actors really came together in a special way. I would recomend this to anyone. it has action, it has comedy."
4,"Good, but a little cheesy","It was a good movie to bring all the different super heros together, but it still was a little cheesy. Some bad one liners and the relationships between the heroes were a little forced."
3,Glad I got it on sale.,"The movie itself is great. I got it when it was on sale for only twenty dollars and I feel like I got my money's worth. I would not pay over 25 dollars for this set though. It says 4 disc but in reality it's only more like 2. You get the dvd and blu-ray which is fine. They other two disc are Blu-ray 3D and the digital copy. If feel like they only added them to make it sound like your getting more, they should have just put the digital copy on a code and left out the 3D blu-ray all together (who even has a 3d blu-ray player?). That it's it's a little lacking in special features, you'd think the top of the line set would have hours of features but it's really only a blooper reel, some commentary, and like 30 minutes of interviews normally I'd be fine with that but like I said, for the top of the line box set it's a little weak.That's two negatives so I feel like I should take 2 stars off. If I was rating the movie itself it would be 5 stars but this box set is only 3."
3,parts ar unwatchable,"I buy all my movies from one specific vendor on Amazon because they always are truthful about the quality of their movies. unfortunately this movie has several spots that are unwatchable. I am in the process of sending it back for another copy. It was a disappointment, but the movie is still a great one, and I hope to have it replaced.."
2,Marvels The Avengers,"Tedious, over done, to long and silly.And I am a lover of SiFi. Aliens is stillmy Number 1."
1,Not cool Marvel,"First of all the movie is great, one of the best I have ever seen. It is how the movie is being released that I have a problem with. The DVD comes with a lot extra features while the DVD release comes with almost none, not even the deleted scenes. I was looking foreward to seeing the deleted scenes. This is not fair. If I buy the movie I want the full movie, including the scenes that were cut. They are just trying to get more money out of you. If they can put it on the Blu-ray then they should put it on the DVD as well. I should not be punished because I do not have a Blu-ray player."
2,the avengers 2012,"I went to see this after reading all the terrific reviews and was dissapointed after veiwing.I have seen all of marvels films and this one just did not cut it.I will not go into detail about the movie,because there are people who have not seen it yet and they can judge for themselves.I would personally not recommend pre ordering movie untill you have watched it.Overall the movie was not terrible,just not 4 to 5 star terriffic as stated in the reviews."
3,"Movie is great, sound quality on the download was bad","The movie was great, but I had to turn the volume up to almost max to hear any of the dialog. It's almost impossible to hear on my iPad or Kindle Fire."
1,"Great Movie, digital copy was useless","The movie was great, this review is based on the 4 disk combo. First like others have stated the movies are stacked onto each other, than the issue with the digital copy. My son loves this movie witch is why I opt for the combo with the digital copy I figured I can transfer it to my samsung tab ""WRONG"" you cant even watch the digital copy of the movie on your computer. I get a msg stating that the license is not valid, whats the point of the digital copy if you cant use it. I hope amazon see's that there is an issue with the digital copy in this 4 disk set and try to help. Thanks"
1,nothing special.,"boring, predictable, too much CGI and nothing special.The Christopher Nolan Batman films remain far and away the best super-hero films."
1,Marvel's The Avengers,"A lousy movie and a waste of time. I don't know what other people see that is so good. Long winded, totally obscure to me and I found it impossible to follow. Maybe it is a culture thing and you have to be a reader of the comics and already be know these weird characters."
5,"Well made, well acted, and thank you for the eye candy","Has there ever been a movie made with such beautiful men? Yes thats superficial but as my 7 year old granddaughter said ""seeing Thor was worth the price of the ticket."" I've seen it three times, twice in the movies and once One Demand, I guess I could be called a ""fantard"" which is funny since I'm not into comic book characters but the movie was not only well casted it had a good story line and great special effects.I had to give a side bar to the Hulk, this is the first time I thought the actor did a believable job and the CGI didn't look like someone got crazy with a green crayon. I gave it 5 stars because I can't think of one thing I would do different.I will say I saw the guy who plays Captain America in a interview and in the real world he's a jerk with a huge ego."
3,Special features on BluRay,"The combo set came in good condition, and it has a lot for the price. However, the special features are only on the blu-ray edition and not on the DVD. I bought the set because I thought it would be fun to have the blu-ray for the future, but since I don't have a player for it, I was disappointed to find that I'm not able to watch the special features."
5,Greatest Movie I have ever seen!,"The title of my review says it all! It has everything that makes a movie great: action, real comedy, suspense. Awesome! I have probably watched this a million times! I am actually watching it right now..."
5,FANTASTIC!!!!,One of the BEST flicks I have seen in a long time! With all the build up over the years form the individual characters movies I had high hopes for this movie and it TOTALLY lived up to them!I can't wait for the sequel!
4,Visually stimulating and fun.,"The evil brother of Thor opens up a portal allowing alien beings up to no good to wreak havoc upon humankind. A group of superheroes is formed in order to save the planet as we know it. This is the culmination of a series of superhero films and this one features all the main characters, bringing them together, allowing them to use their unique gifts in order to dispose of the bad guys. Bringing all of these alpha males (and one female) together does present its problems, as they at times are competing with each other. However, they are able to put aside any differences and work together for the common good. There are also a few laughs, but the highlights of this one are the spectacular visuals. This is a visually stimulating film that is a solid start to the summer movie season."
1,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,"I love the movie so much. This DVD locks up on previews so much. Here is the thing about that...I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN BUY THE DVD REGULAR VERSION AGAIN. I WOULD RATHER DIE, GO TO HELL AND BURN FOR ALL ETERNITY THAN BE EXPOSED TO YOUR PREVIEWS ONE MORE TIME. I DONT CARE ABOUT FRANKENWEENIE. I HAVE SEEN YOUR CRAPPY ""PREVIEW"" OF INTERVIEWS WITH THE CAST AND I WANT TO PEEL MY EYES BY THE NANOMETER TO THE CORE AND FEEL EVERY LAYER IN PREFERENCE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU DID THIS WHEN I PRE-ORDERED THIS FILM THREE MONTHS IN ADVANCE. MAY ZEUS CAST YOU INTO AN ETERNAL PIT OF SUFFERING AND DAMNATION TO ROT AND BURN UNTIL EXISTENCE HAS PASSED BY YOU INNUMERABLE TIMES. Love, me. :-)"
1,Amazon's poor design,"As with most websites Amazon is poorly designed. Their digital movie downloads don't display how much has downloaded nor when it is a good time to play your movie without constant buffering interruptions. The sound was off and image was pixelated, had to restart several times to correct this problem. Awful design. Blockbuster.com let's you know when your movie is ready for uninterrupted play. Amazon's site also doesn't give you shipping cost on individual physical items when purchasing several items, not even at check out! Awful design again.Rating is for Amazon. As for 'The Avengers' - it's a great movie!"
4,fun smashing,"I was looking for something simple to de-stress and generally stop thinking. This fit the bill well. Acting was just OK, but you really don't watch these superhero blockbusters for the acting. Action sequences, big booms, all requisite for the genre with some funny quips added in for good measure. It was fun without expectations."
5,Excellent,"Great Movie with an Excellent cast that feels like it flows naturally from the previous movies. Now Joss, with all this new found blockbuster glory... maybe you can Bring Back Firefly. :-D"
4,Good superhero fun,An all-star cast and lots of flashy effects help this comic-come-to-life amuse and amaze. Great bundle with lots of extras to explore!
5,Everything is what I expected and on time!,"Had a good price for two DVD's, one was blue ray and the other was a regular DVD. Very happy with the product and price!"
5,The Avengers,Great special effects and great cast of actors. True to form and based on the comic book charcters. Will probably add to my 'own' collection!
3,Avengers is predictable,"Good comic book on screen, but I suppose I just could not keep my interest in this film. I am sure younger viewers may like this more."
4,"Good Movie, Great 3D","I won't review the movie because you can find a plethora of that on the internet. I will add my 2 cents about the 3D. It's pretty amazing. The clarity is great, detail is amazing, and the 3D is eye-popping. Some of the night scenes are a little flat but just a little. The action scenes are done beautifully. If you have a 3D tv, I highly recommend this."
3,defectuos sound,in 3d disk final moments the audio off when iron man push the missil into space to he wake up
5,Awesome!!!!,Great movie! On Blu-ray with a good sound system is just fantastic! Go get it now! You won't be disappointed
5,Avengers one of the best movies in this year,Great blu Ray I love the box and it comes with Blu ray and DVDIt's amazing but i'm still waiting the great box set of Marvel collection of the phase one of Marvel Avengers
3,Video quality,"I payed for the HD rental and the video quality was standard at best. Was often so blurry it was hard to focus on anything. Gonna stick to standard rentals until this is improved, but there were no other issues everything else with the order was top notch."
2,Loved the movie. Disappointed that most extras aren't on DVD.,"I really enjoyed this movie. I'm not complaining about that.I own a DVD player, but I bought the Blu-Ray/DVD combo because (unlike the solo DVD), it had several extras that I was curious to watch (gag reel, out-takes, alternate beginning, etc. I didn't realize that the double-set meant that I got the bare-bones DVD and a Blu-Ray (with all the extras) that won't play on my player. I'm returning it to Amazon and will just buy the regular DVD for less. I'm seriously irritated that I cannot find these extras in DVD format. Sorry, Marvel, you burned me on this one."
1,Will never pay extra for digital copies again.,"This review is not about the movie but the specific product. I totally agree with all the other reviews about the digital copy.I just wanted to add that playing the digital copy itself causes problems after it is copied to my laptop. First off, it ""only"" works if I plug my laptop via HDMI to my TV. It will NOT work if I try to watch it on the laptop display. Windows Media complains that my hardware display is ""insecure"". That is just BS. So the advertising of ""watch anywhere, any time"" is wrong because it's just not true. I didn't have problems with X-Men, Thor or previous Marvel movies so this encryption/security is just causing more headaches as a movie fan."
2,Avengers great; Disney not so much,"The movie The Avengers is a grand, fun superhero romp with great blockbuster action and lots of quiet jokes that make for a fantastic experience. I've seen it three times now, and it was just as fun the third time as the first.As for this particular product, I bought the DVD/Blu-ray combo pack because it was supposed to contain the deleted scenes and other extras. I don't have a Blu-ray player, but I paid -extra- for these features which are at least implied to be on the DVD. It turns out they are only on the Blu-ray.I can't fathom why they are punishing me for not having a Blu-ray player, but I shall get my money's worth yet -- by giving the Blu-ray disk to someone who does."
3,Meh.,"My friends raved. I was mildly entertained at times. Just meh--didn't suck, didn't rock. It wasn't worth the $5 though."
4,Great movie!,Very intertaining! I loved how they brought all of the Marvel characters together to fight for good. I would highly recommend this movie!
4,combo pack is for all,"I purchase the combo dvd packages because of being able to play them on all types of computers, notepads, phones, dvd players, etc. I usually buy pre-orders from amazon because I get them the day that they arrive in stores. Movie was ok"
4,Great Super Hero Egos,"After the ""heroes"" go head to head with their egos, the story get underway. It's a great romp through comic-come-to-life land."
2,"Good effects, but lousy movie","We had read the good reviews of this movie and since we have 3-D TV, we purchased the Four-Disc Combo. The 3-D effects are well-done, but the movie is constant fighting from the get-go. Very loud and very boring!"
4,Great Movie,Me & the kids love this action movie & all the heros almost done purchasing their individual movies as well
5,"Great Movie, great blu-ray release","I'll keep this one short, I admit I was a bit worried when this movie was about to come out, but was relieve to see that it lived up to the hype and the build up was worth it. Now onto the bluray itself, what can I say, the movie looks great and sounds great as well, the 3D is done well and I definitely enjoyed it on my 3D tv, the 3D doesn't look last minute like other movies and I'd say adds to some of the action. I recommend to all marvel fans."
5,Amazing popcorn movie.,"I'm a Marvel guy and this one is definitely their best comic book movie. Dark Knight Rises and Avengers are top of my comicbook based movies. Lots of action and it is great seeing all these heroes come to live. DKR is hands down a deeper movie with a message, Avengers is full action."
5,Great,"Enjoy this DVD , good buy ... Would buy another product just like this.....I would tell a friend about this product"
5,Wow!,"If you haven't seen this movie yet -- what are you waiting for? It's by far one of the best, if not the best, superhero movie ever made. Hats off to Joss Whedon who expertly crafted a movie that held one enthralled for 2 1/2 hours. Great writing, great directing. Can't wait for Avengers 2 -- also to be written and directed by Mr. Whedon."
5,Is there a 6th Star,Saw the film twice even the review I read it says its a little slow to get started-from what I can this movie rocked from the start and it was great from the word go
3,Kindle Fire Download,"The movie itself is amazing...the movie downloaded on the kindle fire...not so much. I can hear games from across the room, but cannot hear the movie without it next to my ear (which causes a viewing issue). The only way it is watchable is with headphones and the movie and main volumes on the highest levels...and that is only in a silent room. Disappointed!"
3,Avengers,Movie is awesome.. But for some reason you can't get the bluray to play until you have updated the software on your bluray player
5,Great flick,"I really enjoyed this movie. Great acting, adventure, the whole works. I hope they make another. This was better than Captain America, Thor and the second Iron Man put together. I highly recommend it for all superhero movie lovers."
4,Biast,I love comics and super hero stories and thought it was great watching all the background stories and then watching this movie. It was a fun watch.
3,the avengers,"thanks to my parents for giving me this dvd. It makes me smile when I watch the entire movie, thanks"
5,"Great movie, grate price on package deal.","One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It was great for the whole family, my wife even liked it and said she'd see it again and she doesn't like to watch movies."
2,Amazon Instant Video Has Very Poor Movie Volume,i rented the avengers HD and watched this on the amazon instant video thro my playstation 3 it had significant volume problems couldnt hear anything half the time cranked up the TV to 40 max volume still sounded like everyone was whispering until the end when the main fight started also watched it on my laptop and Galaxy S3 phone same results poor volume quality!
3,Ok,"Just another ok movie in the superhero genre, not bad, not great. If you're looking for basic entertainment (or it is on sale) go for it, otherwise there are so many other better choices."
5,Everything I ever dreamed it would be,"It was exactly the copy i wanted! The only thing I found confusing was the music download. You have to go to some external website, download the music file to your computer THEN upload it to iTunes. But the digital download of the movie is directly through iTunes. The movie is perfect!"
4,Happy,I am very happy with the purchase of my movie for my son He have watch the movie over and over again.I would purchase any other movie he want
4,Great movie,"The action was non-stop and the heroes behaved like such a super team. The story of the villain, Loki, brought such drama to the need for the heroes to stop his evil plan."
4,Good entertainment,Watched it on my Kindle while flying from the west coast to Memphis. Kept me entertained most of the way home.
4,Entertaining on par with TDKR,"It moves along and being a dark knight fan which I loved and with the hype of the competition between them is say they were equal in entertainment value. While I would not buy I would rent if you are looking for fun movie to watch with the family, and you have kept up with all the other characters parts, but you can go into this movie with having seen them."
5,Niiiiiiiice.,Awesome movie. I hope they make more Avenger and Hulk films. Tom Hiddleston was perfect as Loki. Absolutely loved it!
5,Really enjoyed this movie.,"This movie looks great in 3D. This is one of the best comic book movies made. When I pre-ordered this movie it was $25 but went down to $20 on the day of release, Amazon refunded me the difference. I will be pre-ordering all my movies on Amazon from now on."
4,video rental,"product downloaded to my ipad 2 without any problems using the free app. Only problem was I couldn't figure out how to watch it on my TV with the hdmi attachments. Only audio came out, no video so had to watch it on my Mac computer. The good thing is the rental can be watched on ipad or the mac without transferring rental and its good for 48 hrs. Not like Itunes only 24 hrs. So I gave it 4 stars."
3,Prolonged.,The movie has great special effects and some like the catchy lines especially by Ironman. The plot is typical but the flick to me is too long.
5,The world could use some super heroes!!!,What a great movie. The cast was great and the story was great too. I love me a super hero movie. It was funny too. Lots of little one liners to get a chuckle.
4,Action,"This one Hollywood has planned a long time to make. It has a big budget, great special effects. The graphics are brilliant. I am sure that it must have cost a lot of money to make it.Surprisingly, to me, the story is quite passable. Some Norse god is trying to steal a great power source, the Avengers band together to save the Earth and the Universe.The acting is of a high quality. The characters interesting, I particularly like the Hulk. I thought the graphics to make him real were extremely good.The action is good. It will keep both, you and the kids entertained."
1,Unadulterated garbage,There's really nothing to say about this movie. It stinks from the tedious beginning and becomes totally unwatchable unless I suppose you're 8 years old.
1,COME ON REALLY,"PICTURE QUALITY * MOVIE STORY LINE ***** BUT NOT VERY HAPPY, IF I COULD'VE HAD A SAMPLE I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT MEANING THE QUALITY IN PICTURE NOT MOVIE. IF IT GAVE A BLU-RAY PICTURE THEN NO PROBLEM. CAN'T PUT ON A DVD OR MY IPHONE TO TAKE ANYWHERE. I WAS TRYING TO SAVE SOME MONEY. OH WELL I'LL HAVE TO SAVE FOR THE BLU-RAY! LAST DOWNLOAD I WILL EVER BUY!I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
1,HORRIBLE,"Wow, the villains are identical to PowerRanger villains with their puffy, foam costumes that took $5 to make.This is why DC fails over and over. Blah."
5,Awesome film!,By far one of my favorite comic nook films next to the Dark Knight series!!!! Avenger assemble and Hulk smash are my 2 favorite sayings of the year!
5,"Son if you are not an alien, then you have a problem!","Great movie with a lot ...and I mean lot of special effects.The story is simple: all superheroes are reunited to save the earth from a bunch of ugly aliens. The acting is fantastic as expected and dominated by Robert Downey Jr (Iron man) who always cracks these one liners that are sometimes funny. Even Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) finds a way to control himself.If you can, you should definitely watch the movie in 3D. It is really well done. Especially towards the end when the war starts and you can see the planes practically flying over your head."
4,Definitely worth the price,"Whedon really took the best of each actor's superhero character and put them together in this film. I would suspect having Robert Downey Jr. in the cast raised the bar for the other actors, and so long as he is in a scene there is no chance it would devolve to kitsch. All the lead characters are stunningly sexy and good looking, which never hurts, and I liked how they changed some of the uniforms to show some more flesh, which definitely made them more believable (and fun to look at). The visual effects and 3D elements are excellent ."
1,Love the movie...just wish I could actually watch it,Short and sweet...ordered the movie. It came in cracked and when I tried to return it online there was no way I could. So I will trash the one I got on here then head on base to buy one I can actually watch and return if there are issues.
1,Blu-ray Issues,Love the movie. I bought combo pack and the DVD was great. Put in the Blu-ray to watch the extras but wouldn't work. Bought another disk. Same problem. So I hooked up my PS3 to the TV thinking it was my Blu-ray even though others work on it just fine. PS3 also didn't work. So how am I meant to see the Blu-ray?
1,Streaming from Amazon Hit or Miss,I rate this movie with only one star because of video streaming issues at Amazon. I understand the entire Internet isn't under Amazon's control but it seems I don't have nearly as many issue with good old Netflix.I saw the movie at the theater and it is a 5+ Star movie but my nephews will never know that because of the problems watching it via Amazon online.
3,ultraviolet,"For those with an android tablet, download flixter. The ultra violet movies in you library automatically move to this app. This only seems to work when you buy the disc and download with a code though. I tried to buy a novie straight from ultraviolet and it wont show up in flixter."
5,Great movie,This is arguably the best SuperHero movie ever. The dialogue and story/plot were great. The scenes on the Helicarrier were priceless.
5,Finally!!!!,"I have been a comic book fan since I was eight years old (long before it was popular), and am so excited to see what they are doing with comic book movies now! Marvel has done such an amazing job turning their properties into entertaining movies (for the most part, Daredevil, ugh). DC... Not so much. I just want to mention that at heart I am a die-hard Batman fan (Batman was the very first comic book I ever owned). That being said, I felt like this movie was better than the Dark Knight Rises. Call me a traitor if you like, but I felt like the 'Rises' story was pretty weak this time around. I was concerned about this movie from the beginning. I didn't know how in the hell they were going to make a good movie with so many heroes involved, and I didn't know what villain they were going to conjure up that would be sufficient enough to bring these heroes together! Well, they succeeded! Buy it, it is SO amazing!!!"
5,Fantastic,"No need to have a long review on this.If you liked one of the movies like Ironman or Hulk then you will definitely enjoy this one as well.Great visuals for your eyes and a funny and entertaining story will let you enjoy this movie for sure.Relax, enjoy and have fun!"
5,The best 3D movie,"This was my first 3D movie, and it did not disappoint. I've purchased many since then, and none have the great story, great special effects, and great 3D. Highly Recommended!"
4,Avengers,I am a fan of marvel comics so I could not wait for the movie to come out on DVD. It has action and comedy which helps to make it more enjoyable. I am ready for the next movie adventure.
5,LOVE IT,IT IS AN EXCELLANT MOVIE <> OF course I Love Robert Downey Jr.. Couldn't beat the price for what ya get> 4 disc combo + digital
2,The movie was great. Quality from amazon poor.,"I would reccomend this movies to anyone. If you like action or not, it is a good movie. This is however the second movie we have rented through amazon and the voices and sounds of the movie dont match up. We were constatly turning the volume up and down the whole night. Terrible sound quality from amazon. Good movie."
5,Fantastic,I wanted this for my husband & we watched this week and it was fantastic. Amazon were really quick & there was no problems with the product.
2,"Great Movie, but stupid Hollywood","So first, I want to say that this movie is awesome. Joss Whedon has outdone himself.However, the DVD in this 2 Disc Set doesn't play on computers. That means that I can't take it with me on a trip and watch it on my notebook. I understand that Hollywood is trying prevent piracy (impossible challenge), but by limiting my ability to use their product as I see fit within my legal rights, I deem this product defective.I received it as a gift, so I will be having my gift giver return it to Amazon as defective.Hollywood - stop this stupid abuse of your customers. This encourages piracy, it doesn't prevent it. You've enabled people who steal your movie to get more usability out of it than people that pay for it."
4,Dope,"It's a solid movie, and the blu ray is nicely done. I just wish they would get rid of all the trailers at the beginning but that's a universal complaint."
5,Marvel's Avengers Gives DC Comics Justice League Something to think about,"The Avengers has everything you are looking for in an action packed super hero film. It's surprising that D.C. Comics has never jumped on the idea of a blockbuster film with six of it's best super heroes. Marvel is way ahead of the game with thier Action Six pack Superhero extravaganza.The storyline is pretty basic: Bring in The Avengers or the world will end as we now know it.Lots of action and great special effects. These superheroes have hearts and brains, as well.They offer up a worthy villian, as well.Holy Super Hero Flicks, Batman, Marvel has upped the stakes and audience expectations!"
4,great movie!,this was a very on point movie. cant wait for the sequal to come out because this movie did not disappoint one bit
5,Marvel's The Avengers,"Lots of content, low price. Gave the DVD to my parents, kept my Blu-Ray disc. Downloaded to iTunes seamlessly. Everyone wins!"
5,Video on demand is often my go to venue,"I am one of those that have loads chores to do with a great yard, garden, and home. And I work full timeand I live 38 miles away from the nearest town that even has a Walmart! We love Video on demand II loved this movie! Hate to admit I am a over 60 female !"
2,I need vengeance,As the movie progresses more pixels are apparent giving the picture an abstract quality. Even glasses can't clear this mess up
3,Pretty good,I really really really wanted to LOVE this movie but in the end I think I set my expectations too high (just like with The Dark Knight Rises). It had many good action scenes but just because they introduced all the characters in the previous movies doesn't mean that they had to go lackluster on the story here. Don't get me wrong seeing all these characters together was awesome but I still felt like I didn't really know them completely. And I thought the whole bit with the aliens fell into been there done that territory. Oh well I'm sure Avengers 2 will be better. Overall this was a fun movie just not perfect. Enjoyable but not the best superhero movie ever.
4,Good Family Movie,"I'm not a huge fan of comic to movie stories, but this was a decent watch. Recommended for a lazy family weekend."
4,Had a few bad sectors but otherwise played well.,"We still watch it though and it appears to play better the more we use it. Our player is able to unscramble some of the lost information when Captain America and Ironman work together to save the ship but we only lose a few seconds twice and we see the main portions. Originally, we weren't able to see this scene at all but now it is a lot better. The company game us a full refund when I first wrote them about the problem so I am happy and it may clear up totally. I might buy a replacement but if it continues to clear up, I won't and then I feel I should return their money. Either way I felt this company was great and the movie too."
3,Nice movie but....,"The movie has a lot of effort and you can see that, you may get bored a little bit, because the story is kind of repeated and also predictable and some parts really does not make any sense in the overall story.But overall, you may want to see it but if it was for less than $0.99."
5,Awesome movie.,I loved the movie. It arrived promptly. I would recommend this movie to a friend. I would watch it again.
4,great movie,"I rented this movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. One needs to watch it with a sense of humor. There is a great deal of violence and it is, therefore, not for small children. They might become upset. I found the joining of so many superheroes very entertaining."
5,Great movie,Well put together cast. They did a great job. Can't wait for the next movie in the series. A must watch.
2,Great Flick Terrible Home Release,"Great movie, however, with the blu ray 3d release the digital copy was SD only. Other new releases I have recently bought have included an HD copy as the digital copy. Also all four discs were were only in two slots, basically discs were stacked on top of each other. Disappointed in the packaging."
2,Sorely disappointed,"I am a huge Joss Whedon fan, a huge comic book nerd and a huge fan of the superhero, and especially Marvel superhero, in general. So this movie was a HUGE letdown. Nothing really happens. The villain isn't even that villain-y. Iron Man has a few good lines, but overall I was left wondering why there was such hype surrounding this movie."
2,Just a Bore,"With the exception of Robert Downey Jr., don't waste your time. Empty Plot, dialogue is just pitiful. dont waste your money."
3,I DIDN'T LIKE THIS MOVIE AT ALL...,"I COULD HAVE WRITTEN A BETTER SCRIPT, MY BOYFRIEND LIKED IT, BUT I FOUND IT BORING AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN AWESOME, I LOVE HEROES, BUT I DID NOT THINK THEY DID A GOOD JOB WITH THE CHARACTERS THEY HAD AND THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE HEROES FROM OTHER MOVIES IN IT, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WAY BETTER."
3,"Some nice special effects, content kept me interested - barely","The writing of the movie - especially in the early going - was poor. The writers played up the ego issues too much and made the characters too immature. At the end, the heros are able to survive too much against too many. Could have made all more credible by using the threat of what was coming before the miraculous conclusion. Keep the action but keep it believable. Give your audience a chance to be a little smarter."
5,Great Movie,"Great Movie love me some Stark. This movie has action, comedy and a little romance perfect for most families. The gag real was great"
4,"Marvel Movie Universe...Best yet, BUT...","Re: 2 disc Blu-Ray/DVD edition...To be brief only disappointed with this edition's lack of a digital copy code. All of the other tie-in 2 disc editions included a digital copy code & I have them in iTunes on my cloud & laptop. However now I might have to buy the 3D 4 disc set just for the code??? How cheap is that? I challenge Disney, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Paramount, whomever made this edition to make a code available to 2 Disc edition purchasers. I do not have 3D do not want 3D & this film was not originally filmed in 3D!!! Nuff Said!"
2,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"Frankly, I was disappointed by this film. I expected it to be much better than all the superhero films from which it flowed, but it came up short. The storyline was tediously protracted, with sparse heroic actions taking place, and too many scenes being shot in the dark. The characters were okay, but the plot was rather banal. The film's only strength, in my opinion, is when the Hulk picked up one of the villains like a fly swatter and smashed him repeatedly to the ground -- left and right -- in a ""pissed off"" response to the villain's arrogant assertion of God-like superiority over the Hulk and insulting the Hulk's intelligence."
2,Bonus features did not work.,"I love the movie, but the disc set was somewhat disappointing. The bonus features come on a separate disc, and I could not get any of them to work except for the digital copy of the movie. When I tried to get the comic from the Marvel website, the site created my account, then kicked me out of the site. When I logged back in, I did not have the comic book and my code for it had been cancelled. I had no better luck getting my copy of the music or the bonus features. I ended up having to purchase the movie again from Itunes in order to be able to get the music video, gag reel, and other bonus features."
5,Reviews,I Love these items. Thier items are timely on arrival. I really love having the such a wide variety of items to select from.
5,movie,Nice package for the price. Would recomend this to other people. Amazonshipping is always fast and well pa cked. Good movie also.
5,Awesomeness.,The movie was great. especially seeing in in hd makes the picture a lot better. I can not complain. great.
5,Amazing,In my opinion this is by far the best superhero movie of all time. The box office numbers didn't lie--i'll watch this over and over again.
4,proctorhlls,the item was shipped and receive on time with no damage. This dvd is a chrismas present for my nephew
3,Doesn't Live up to hype,"We waited through the summer madness over The Avengers, had heard the hype, some friends saw it and liked it so we were excited to watch it on our new HDTV.We had seen all the previous super hero movies that were building up to this one. A lot of action without enough story. Each hero fights each other then they come together to fight a super, arch-villan.....like I said...lots of fighting not so much story."
3,Marvel Avengers,It was slow starting and the characters seem disjointed but as the movie progress the characters seemed more believable.By the middle of the movie it came together and was enjoyable after.
4,Awesome,"3rd time watching the movie. Kids and I just love it, can't wait for part 2. Great gift for my son who can't stop acting like The Hulk.."
4,Good movie,"Great movie, downloaded quick. Never had to leave the house. Having a list of movies to pick from makes it easy to enjoy. Now if Yahoo can deliver 3D!!"
2,"Fantastic movie, horrible audio mix","I loved this movie, but the Blu Ray in the two-disc set has an unacceptable dialogue level on my television. I do not have this issue with any other Blu Ray or DVD in my collection. We had to crank the volume up to 75 just to hear the dialogue and my kids were still asking me to repeat many of the characters' lines (we typically have the volume set between 12 and 20). We constantly turned down the volume during high-action scenes to keep it close to a consistent level. We also have a home theater set up with a newer receiver, and I had to turn the center channel balance all the way up.I don't see this mentioned in other reviews but I don't think I have a defective disc because all other aspects are perfect. We were all anxiously awaiting this movie but were distracted and disappointed with the sound levels."
4,Great movie!,"I loved this movie... if you liked any of the other Avenger movies, you'll like this one, too! Would watch it again."
5,Great gift,Haven't seen the movie..heard it was great. Bought it for my daughter and she loves it. This is a good gift for a guy or girl.
3,Avengers a good rainy day movie,Rented this during a boring rainy day. The flic was not bad. The action held up throughout the movie. The plot was so so.
4,"Good, not great 3D","This movie is very good for a super hero flick, however I felt like the 3D version was nowhere near as good as it was in the theater. They should have added more depth rather than using gimmicks, such as flyouts. Overall - good movie, poor 3D presentation."
4,One of the best super hero movies,Not much to say about this movie it is one of the best super hero movies to hit the silver screen. A fun action flick for everyone. You do not need to really know the back story of each of the super heroes to enjoy the flick.
3,Maybe it just doesn't translate to the small screen,"I don't know, seeing all these Marvel characters in one place is kind of cool. But there just wasn't that much of a ""wow"" factor watching it on my computer monitor. Certainly entertaining, but that's about where it ends."
5,Thanks,This was one awesome movie that was just so much fun to watch. Iron Man & Thor just made it all happen!
3,fun to watch,"I found this fun to watch but like so many movies these days, it's a kiddy flick, which ultimately lacks substance."
5,I'll bet you ten bucks you will like this movie!,"I was worried that this movie was biting off more than it could chew with so many actors in one story line.But it was one of the best movies that I have seen since the first Iron Man. PS Don't stop watching until the last credits are done, ;)."
4,enjoyed it,we were testing Amazon Prime and we wanted to see this movie when it was in the Theatres but we missed it then so now we enjoyed it on our Sony Blu-Ray
2,Movie: Marvel's The Avengers,This was another disappointing and boring movie for me and my grandsons.Too long and drawn out and very amateurish. Thanks
3,Too Long,"I enjoyed the humor, and interplay of the previious superhero movies, Capitan American, Ironman, Thor but the film itself drug out much too long. The closing fight sequence seemed like it would never end."
3,ok not great,first of all this is a 3D movie in 2D..so that takes off a star at the get go...they tried hard to make the archer and the girl look relevant with guys with super powers..but that didn't quite work...the big action set piece at the heart of the movie went on a little too long..and was slightly anti-climatic after the original the second group of invaders appeared..kind of dragged on and on...i was so gals i didn't pay the big bucks at the movie plex....
3,Average movie,"This movie tries to use CGI and big names to draw crowds, however falls short of having a cohesive and intelligent plot. Looks great but lacks substance. Why Hawkeye or black widow are even in the movie is questionable."
2,why two stars,"I bought this item from the UK as the release for this country omitted various extras, what the site fails to tell you is that since January 1st all purchases outside the EU (European Union) attract customs duty.Had Disney studios released the same version for the UK I'd have bought the disc here thereby avoiding nearly US$ 20 custom duty.Amazon have the power to withdraw the UK batch and replace it with the Amwrican version but have not done so as far as I am aware nor have they placed a warning on their US website. This affects not only UK but purchases from all EU member countries."
3,Not as I expected.,very unmemorable movie I gave it 3 stars only because there were a couple nice effects shots. I think that the actors these days are terrible they all try to overact or mush it up too much. They pump these lousy movies out like bowel movements . No real originality
5,bought for my son,My son is a very big fan of the Avengers. We bought this movie for him so he can watch it over and over again. Great movie.
5,good,"The movie was in perfect quality, the description was very accurate to what I got in return.Absolutely no complains about the product."
5,GREAT,THIS IS A REALLY GOOD KIDS MOVIE! MY HUSBAND AND SON JUST LOVED IT! THIS IS TOTALLY A GUY MOVIE!
5,great movie great packaging,This was a wonderful movie and really took the franchise to a whole new level. The 3D blu ray is awesome because this movie was actually made with this viewing experience in mind. Very enjoyable.
5,Best Marvel Film of All Time!,i have been awaiting this movie to be made since i was a kid and i am very happy. this is on the list of top films i have seen in 2012!
4,What a movie,"Joss Whedon successfully takes what is a complicated and job and make it seem completely seamless and effortless. I was blown away with how well these characters all interacted together so well. I was blown away by the efforts of Joss Whedon, the entire cast and the special effects by ILM studios. Definitely worth buying on blue ray."
5,Great movie for the fan boy in us all,"I loved this movie, even with multiple viewing the avengers never fail to impress. The avengers even took me back, making me feel like I was a kid all over again and watching my very first movie with characters that I had only seen in cartoons or comics."
4,Best marvel yet!,"So good. Not just the action, like almost all super hero movies... But the script and actors are actually great too! It blends seamlessly with the back stories from previous movies, which were also really well done (except I thought Thor was cut off from Earth at the end of his movie.) worth buying!"
3,...meh,"The digital download copy wouldn't work for me. Also, I was expecting a lot more in the special features, kinda disappointed by that but it's still a great movie and considering what you get for the price it was a pretty good deal."
2,sound in on demand version is aweful!!!,"I love this movie, saw it twice in theaters and couldn't resist renting when I saw it, even though we will buy the blu ray. One thing that has always bothered me wih on demand is lack of subtitles. But usually it can be turned up to hear it. This movie was horrible though!! We have an awesome sound system, and usually at 25% we are blasted out of our seats. We had it at 100% and could still barely hear any of the dialog at all. It was really ridiculous. I regret the $5 for the hd version because we could barely understand it. Do yourself a favor, just buy the disc, because you'll love the movie, but this version will ruin it for you. Especially if it is your first time."
5,Awesome Movie,Loved this movie. I had seen some of the Iron Man movies but hadn't seen Captain America or Thor when we went. I was not disappointed. There was so much action that I want to see it again because I know that I missed something.I can't wait for the DVD to release.
5,Just An Awesome Movie!!! Definitly 5 STARS!!,"I could tell you what is so awesome about this movie but there is just to much and I don';t want to type forever.I personally expected it to be a good movie (Because the other Marvel movies are pretty good), But I didn't expect it to be this good... Period!Loaded with action & comedy in moments. Anyone who gives this below 4 stars is just a hater plain and simple. Can't wait for the next one and the new Iron Man movie coming next summer."
3,Marvel's The Avengers (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray/DVD + Digital Copy + Digital Music Download),"This isn't a review of the movie, it's for the case. You'd think you fork out the extra dough for the 3D combo pack, the supplier would ""hook up"" their customer (that's me) with a case that holds all 4 discs. I am so sick and tired of these packaging marketing ""execs"" who make stupid money saving decisions that ruin their own product! I have 4 discs, I should have a case that holds 4 discs, instead of a case that holds 2 and you stack the discs on top of each other?This is the cheapest move I have ever seen short of buying the box set and getting all of my discs jammed in scratchy cardboard sleeves. C'mon people."
1,sucks when all the special features are only offered on blu-ray,"Why the hell did Marvel only make features available on the Blu-ray discs? That's foul and just stupid. What about of folks that don't have a Blu-ray player, only DVD players? How the hell am i suppose to see the deleted scenes, beg someone who owns a blu-ray player to let me come over and watch it? Stupid!"
1,"No Bonus Features for DVD, even with the combo pack!","I purchased the DVD/Blu-ray combo pack even though I don't have a Blu-ray player - I paid $5 more than the DVD so I could get the special features, which are usually pretty good with Marvel movies. When I got the discs today, though, I found that they have SPLIT the bonus features, so all of them but the director's commentary are on the Blu-ray disc, NOT the DVD. Not sure how you're supposed to access the bonus features if you only have a DVD player. Guess that was a waste of $5. Bad form & misleading advertising, Paramount."
5,loved it,"Loved it, first movie I've gone to see twice in the theater (in expensive IMAX) twice.So, the take home, able to rewind, pause when I want, repeat... experience of the discs is worth it."
5,Awesome movie!,This movie was great. My family and I enjoyed it so much. It was the first movie we have watched in 3D on our TV that actually looked true 3D.
2,I guess I am too old for this one.,"I guess I am too old to like this movie. Do see how 20 something males would but to me, seemed like script was written to give equal time to various super heroes and to me, plot was silly. I know super hero plot and all but just did hold my attention. Special effects are good and so too action but that not enough for me at 66 years of age. Date movie? If < 30 maybe. 500+ million box office for this?? A lot of < 25 yr old males must have gone 6 times each. Sorry all those that loved it, it was too silly and too many super heroes for me."
1,Extras,First off I love the movie but the so called extras and bonus stuff was weak.I was expecting a lot more and I was left flat. If you bought the DVD and yourupset you didn't get the bonus stuff. Dont worry you didn't miss anything great.
1,2 Channel Audio,"Are you kidding! 2 Channel audio For a new release DVD. Cost's 4.00 for 2 channel audio. Plus 80.00 dollars a year, to subscribe, to Prime. I had to crank my stereo up so loud just to hear dialog.(Which I couldnt hear) BS!!! Had to reorder on dish network. at least its was True 5.1 audio playback. Folks pay 2 dollar's more and order it on Dish. This is the second time I've been screwed over by Amazon. 5.1 auio means surround sound ( WITH CENTER CHANNEL) plus subwoffer. GET IT RIGHT AMAZON !!!!!"
3,"Good, but not great","I know that i'm going to be attacked here, but i honestly didn't think this was the best movie of 2012. i thought the movie was kinda dull in some areas and the story actually seems to be thrown together with no glue to hold it together which leads eventually to the alien attack which lead no where. the only thing that kept it going was the chemistry between the actors. it was fun to watch yes, but not that great. i can see why some people would consider this one of the best comic book movies of all time, but it just seems way overrated. it's just an okay movie, nothing really stood to make me want to watch it numerous times (besides pointing out all the plot holes- trust me, there were a ton)"
1,KILLED IT ON BLU-RAY RELEASE FORMAT!!!!!,Such I LOVE THIS FLICK & couldn't wait to buy it on blu-ray..NOW NOT going to with This lame 1.85 ratio release. That's not damn widescreen & theater releases on bluray format!Should be 2.35 ratio widescreenI would just see it as rental worth NOTING MORE!
3,Good...could have been better,"Loved Thor, Iron Man, Green Lantern and Captain America movies, and i like thisone also. But it seems a big portion of the first part is dedicated to Looki andfinally after a while the big invasion starts....Still for such a invasion, thereis little death and blood and for so many aliens and new technology...they kindaget beaten back pretty fast. I still recommend this films...but i think i likeBattleship better..they won ...and without super heroes..."
5,Awesome movie.,This is great movie that many will enjoy even if there's not surperhero fans. I can't wait for Avengers 2.
5,Action Packed Movie,Great movie. Full of actilon and computer graphics were outstanding. My kids (10 & 12) were glued to their seats for the whole picture. Need a sequal to this one. Wish they had movies like this when I was growing up.
1,Very cheesy and disappointing!,Do not waste your money on this movie! Rent it for $3.99 or wait until its 99cents rental! Very cheesy storyline....too contrived!
1,More Information.,"Most people see these movies in the theater before they make it to dvd, so why give a long description of the story which only leaves out the ending.Those who've seen it know the story, those that haven't & wait for the dvd's (Blu-Ray, 3D, or Standard)only need a short taster to know why to get it.What nobody seems to put in these reviews is whether the movie on whatever form of DVD is, the great quality of the picture & sound, what the extras (if any) are, if the dvd is Region Locked or Region Free ect.Those are the reviews that would be helpful from people for me & millions of other readers looking to buy these dvd's.It would also help if Amazon gave more of this info in their descriptions of the releases that they are selling, which in my view is all ways sorely lacking."
5,Awesome,I hate the way the companies do the digital copy. It is only good on one computer. Otherwise it is a great set and Awesome movie.
1,Movie was fun - Amazon streaming quality was horrible,"This review will not deal with the movie, which I enjoyed as much as I could considering the tech frustrations. EVERY time I have purchased an HD movie to stream via Amazon, I have had problems with the movie stopping and/or the quality of the stream deteriorating to sub-DVD quality. This doesn't happen when I watch HD movies on Netflix, which is running through the same Roku 2. In fact I don't recall having these problems streaming free Prime content. Needless to say, I won't be purchasing any more HD streams from Amazon."
3,entertaining,"lots of actions, good ending, i did like this better than thor. i liked the assortment of superheros. my favorite character was iron man."
2,Special Features *only* on Blu-ray disc?? I feel cheated,"Okay, I am a HUGE fan of Marvel Comics, the Marvel movie franchise, any of Joss Whedon's work, and of ""The Avengers"" in particular. It is a stunning movie. Truly. That said...WARNING: IF YOU ONLY HAVE A DVD PLAYER, *all* of the special features are limited to the **Blu-ray disc only.**I purchased the 2-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo because, unlike the 1-disc DVD, it had all the special features. But apparently I was misled. Yes, that's right, on the DVD in this package (and, I assume, the 4-disc one as well), there are *NO* deleted scenes, no extended scenes, no gag reel, no ""A Visual Journey"" featurette, and none of the little easter eggs reputed to be hidden in the blu-ray menu. And thanks to copyright laws, it takes hours to find any of these things online - some you can't find at all.I feel genuinely cheated.If I didn't want special features, I would have bought the 1-disc. Thanks a lot, Marvel. >=["
5,Amazing movies,"Probably one of my favorite marvel movies. It was a blast and just really good. I would honestly suggest for anyone. Bought the big box set and I have it on my ipad, which is awesome and looks beautiful. If you liked this movie and have an ipad, must buy the big box set."
5,mybuy5,"If you don't buy many DVDs, then Avengers is a MUST-HAVE for your DVD library! Loved the movie. Lots of good previews and extras on this DVD."
4,its a good movie,A lot of action and some comedic overtonesIt is a deffinit must buy for any comic book fan in your life this holiday season
5,Avenders,This product was fantastic came to me brand new unopened and in great shape and arrived on time. I am extremely happy.
5,Good deal - great package,"This was a great deal with both the DVD and Blu-Ray, with none of the nonsense that normally comes with these things. I don't need a digital copy with all the DRM involved, etc, just give me the movie, and an extra copy in DVD so I can watch it when I don't have a Blu-Ray player handy. This gave me exactly what I wanted with nothing I didn't at a price that was very reasonable. I'd recommend anybody looking for a copy of this file buy this version. Oh, and it was a great film by the way....if you haven't seen it yet I would HIGHLY recommend it. Joss Whedon does a great job bringing all these heroes together and not letting any of them outshine the others, each having their own unique and compelling backstory. If you are a fan of superhero or action movies at all, pick this one up."
2,CGI porn,"Actually, most pornos have better plots and acting. Also: flying aircraft carrier. Yes, that's right, a flying aircraft carrier. What's its main weaponry? Apparently, foreshadowing."
2,So-So at best...Thor was better,"Had high hopes for this movie. Iron man I&II and Thor were quite good with Thor being a little better probably because of Anthony Hopkins playing Thor's Dad. Anyway, expected more of a story buildup and better interaction between the characters. Expected demonstrational reasoning for most of the super heroes for going from disliking each other to working together but didn't see any of that. One minute they hate each other next they are getting along like life-long pals. Heck the Hulk goes from being uncontrollable to becoming almost intellectual in a split second. Bottom line expected more but got another ""Transformers"" style movie of smash and smash some more....should be offered free with Prime membership like Thor and Transformers: dark side of moon. Either a lot of ""story"" is lying on the cutting room floor or today's audiences don't need much to be wowed."
2,Great Movie-Crap Discs,"Pre-ordered the movie after seeing it in theaters. Movie is excellent. The discs however are not.1. Digital Copy Cannot Play in windows media player!2. They don't give a phone number for support, if you already have this it is 1-800-723-47633. you can forget the digital copy of the sound track, there is no way to download it or get the music filesSo all in all, if you want this movie, just buy the dvd & blu ray and forget the disney digital bull. I might be returning this bundle myself shortly."
3,Action overkill,"Only thing interesting in this movie is the action, but it soon becomes tedious..A movie should have action to compliment the plot, no a weak plot to add to the action."
4,Great cast,Can't wait for Avengers 2 to come out. The action scenes was good and Downey was great and Jackson was great and the other members of the team
4,It was very entertaining.,"I really enjoyed this movie. I like it so much I decided to watch Captain America, which I also enjoyed. This one was fun and kept the plot moving along."
4,Hey what can I say! Works for me.,"Just enjoyed watching and being entertained for awhile. After all isn't that the prime reason for watching movies. To sit back for a couple of hours relax and enjoy! I understand that not all movies have that objective but, darn it's nice to just sit back and watch, enjoy, and escape for a little while! thanks!"
3,Great movie but I have 1 huge complaint about the sound,"Great movie, great action from start to finish, a real mans movie if you know what I mean.But one BIG complaint about it. I rented this on Amazon Instant video, so I don't know if this goes for any other media, but I think it must happen in any media of this movie.The sound quality. When the people are just talking to each other even at highest volume on my computer I can barely make out their words, but when someone is shooting or screaming or something blows up the sound is almost deafeaning.To me this is a huge screw-up. I'm straining my ears to hear human dialogue with no background noise at all, turning up the volume to the highest level just to hear normal speak.A sound effect comes along and I have to cover my ears it's so damn loud.I loved the movie but the sound quality really really pissed me off."
3,what's the big deal?,"It's alright...no different than any of the other super hero movies. Yeah, good special effects, the Hulk was cool, but other than that, what's the big deal?"
5,Great deal!,So many versions including the sound track! Love the movie and this deal. I highly recommend this version of Avengers.
5,Combo Pack For The Win,"I love how they are starting to combo DVD and Blu-Ray into one package. I presently do not own Bl-Ray player, but I expect I will(prolly when Blu-ray goes out of style) and this will make it so I don't have to buy the same movie again. And the movie, of corse, absolutely ROCKED! Can't wait for the next movies from Marvel"
5,Awesome film!,"Love the film, love Iron Man, love Thor, love the Hulk, love Captain America, Green Arrow, and specially the Black Widow. Can't wait for the next Marvel film."
4,Wish it was a digital copy instead of a DVD,"The movie is great and all that, but I wish the option to get the blu-ray/digital copy was more prevalent. Seems to me that those with access to a blu-ray player are more apt to have digital-only devices vs. wanting to watch the movie in low-def."
5,Great Product!,Easily one of the best marvel movies yet! Great quality and bargain for what its worth. Completely accessable and easy to use as well.
4,Pretty good,I watched this with my husband. Has a lot of action which being a girl I am not all that into. But over all it is a pretty good movie
2,Ridiculous,"100 minutes of special effects. No real plot. I didn't expect a great movie, but this was a waste of time."
4,A Pretty Good Movie,"This was a pretty good movie. The action was great. There was also a little bit of comic relief. My only beef with it was that they didn't get Edward Norton to do The Hulk. There have been several different guys that played that past, and Norton was the best. I think I also liked the individual superheros films better than this one. Overall, this movie was a lot of fun. I think that any fan of The Avengers, or superhero movies in general will enjoy it too."
2,Extremely disappointed,"I am so disappointed, I bought this 4-disc DVD as it contained a digital copy, but to my surprise and disappointment it's not available for customers in the UK !!!"
4,Great movie. Good action,I truly enjoyed this movie. I thought is was a great action movie.It is also a great family movie for all ages
4,great movie even better rental for 1.99,"A lot of bang for the buck, great way to finish up Thanksgiving !!!!!!!!!!!! the action all comes at the end of movie."
3,"Large visual spectacle with a feast for action/comic book fans. For non-fans, this is good but rather average","""Think a Thor 2 meets X-Men, The Expendables, Justice League (DC Comics rival), Watchmen, and The Incredibles. Grand, highly action-packed, and fun but rather average escapist filmfare that manages to be smart and savvy and filled with one important and appealing factor- variety! The concern here is that while there is so much to offer, the hype and excess sometimes may leave people feeling exhausted and wanting for more. Going to see The Avengers/Marvel Avengers Assemble wasn't intentional but it was just something to see at the time at the cinema. Everyone rocks on here especially Thor, the Hulk, and Captain America.""PRO: Swift and detailed action sequences. Scenes involving Thor, Captain America, and the Hulk. Inclusion of science and engineering fiction. Cinematography. Special effects.CON: Lacks much in terms of a dynamic storyline. Feels average and same as a whole."
4,meh......,"Meh, I guess it was good.... Is there such a thing as too much over the top effects and stuff, maybe?"
5,Pleased,It's in good condition. It had no scratches and came with the original works for the case. I got what I asked for.
3,"Pretty, but no substance","2 1/2 hours of little plot and gratuitous chase and fight scenes. I love a good super hero movie, but this lacked substance and was all visual fluff."
5,Great as expected!,I saw Avengers at the movies.....twice. It was a must have for my collection of Blu Rays. I've got the unction to pop it in now! Great characters and great storyline.
3,not bad...not great,Just seemed to be missing something though. I think it needed more pizazz...more oomph! All in all not bad though.
1,Disappointing!,After all the hoopla with top reviews this is definitely a big let down: It's a boring cliche ridden bunch of trash! Don't waste your time with this clunker! If you want to see a great new action movie get one of the best James Bond movies ever made Skyfall.
1,Dumb,"2 hours of my life I will never get back. Really disappointing. Nothing else to say. bad, bad, bad, bad"
4,Great movie,"First, the story is complete silliness, even for a superhero movie, but its so fun that I didn't care. The Hulk is a great addition to the modern Marvel movie line up. Captain America makes much more sense as a character now that he is surrounded by much stronger heroes; it is now clear that being brave despite a lack of special powers that makes him the leader. I really disliked his solo movie, so this was a nice surprise.From a technical standpoint, the 3d is great and the sound is amazing. The 3d adds depth without that in your face style that can cause headaches. Plus you get the 2d regular blu ray, a DVD, and a digital copy. I was surprised to find that I received a code for the movie soundtrack as well.My only complaint beyond the silly bad guys was that the Hulk should have come out to play sooner in the movie!"
3,it was too long,plot was okay action was good but the movie was slow at times dragged on too longsome funny parts
5,THE FREAKIN BOMB SHIZZNICK,"This movie is one of the most amazing movies Ive seen ever. Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Suspense....it has it all in one. I was on the edge of my seat the whole ride and didnt wanna get off. Movies like this, I wish they would make them longer.This movie was just FREAKING AWESOME! I dont think I can name a better movie right now.I am so stoked I wanna go suit up fight bad guys now and save our world! Get this in bluray. Watch this on the biggest screen possible. Throw on the surrond sound and put the bass all the way up. Make the walls tremble and then enjoy the ride. I would love to watch this in 3D. I can only imagine how much better the experience would be! I will be sure to watch Avengers 2 in the theater when it comes out..., hopefully IMAX. I dont see how anyone could rate this less than 5 stars, unless you lack a pulse."
1,Description Comparison Misleading,"Great movie, but Amazon's description comparison is misleading. It alludes to the combo packs containing deleted scenes and other features but what they don't tell you is the deleted scenes and other features are only on the Blu-ray disc. They should have clarifed ""Blu-ray only"" in the respective sections. Had Amazon not pumped BS into their comparison I would have bought the standard DVD. So...thanks for that, Amazon."
1,This movie made how much?,Wow what a horrible movie. Scarlet Johanson isn't even that good looking and how come the Hulks pants grow when he grows.
1,Really not sure ...,"I am really not sure what this movie is about, so I won't try to give a detailed review. I was most impressed by the long leather coats that Samuel Jackson and a few of the other actors wore. I was also impressed by Scarlet Johanson's make-up, which actually made her appear to be swarthy in several scenes. There was a lot of action, but I was never really sure who was doing what to whom. Also, what was the deal with this tesseract thing? It didn't even resemble a real tesseract -- but what does? I am sure that if I watched this movie again several times I would begin to figure out what it was about, but life is way too short to waste the time. This one is going on my list of all-time over-rated movies."
3,"predictable and over the top, but fun",Actually would give 3.5 Fun movie but wouldn't watch again. ...and I normally watch good movies several times. The visual effects were 5 stars. Would recommend watching Thor. It was the best of the super hero movies!
2,Dont have Blue Ray....,"Why does the blue ray versions have the special features and deleted scenes? For the $20 for just the dvd version that has absolutely nothing else that comes with it, it is a complete rip-off. For $4 more i could get both versions with stuff included. What the heck Marvel and your partners....."
1,One of the worst movies,"Thin plot, over acting, poor direction. The Red box disc froze half way through and it was a relief. Maybe I am just getting to old for thinly veiled excuses action scenes."
4,Avengers,Great action film tying in many of the recent action heros! It would have been helpful to have seen Thor more recently however since much of the Thor plot line is used in Avengers.
4,Marvels The Avengers,The movie was very good action packed. My son and I both enjoyed it and would watch it again. It was more than i expected.
4,Marvel's The Avengers,"I liked it more than all the individual movies because of the interaction of the different characters, plus it was sort of funny. Casting was good and, although I feel Edward Norton was the perfect Hulk, I enjoyed Mark Ruffalo."
3,The Avengers,"Parts were very slow. Effects were excellent. Volume could have been regulated better, dialog was low action was extremely load, good for the theater but required turning up and down at home."
5,The Avengers,"Wow! What a well developed plot through out the movie! I was a follower of Thor in my young and teen years, being my favorite superhero. Once the movie started there was no stopping. The pause button on my DVD player works just fine, but I didn't want to miss the continuing action!"
4,movie,what can i say .. the movie was and iis what it is supposed to do.. it arrived on time and enjoyed the movie
5,Thank you!!,"Bought this movie for my 11 year old for Christmas. I haven't seen it yet, but I will soon. Thanks!"
4,Needs more bonus features,"The movie is great, the blue ray quality is amazing, but like most production teams they didn't include many very good bonus features, which is half the reason to buy a hardcopy of a movie."
5,Of course you'll like it,"What a great cast. Marvel is really putting out some great superhero movies... besides Ghost Rider, but I think that is Nick Cage's fault."
5,Great movie,"Love this movie. The blue ray is awesome! Definitely watch this if you haven't already. It's action packed and a lot of fun to watch, too!"
3,Specific to Four-Disc Blu-ray,"I absolutely love the movie, but don't rely on getting your digital copy, digital album, digital comic, and poster. I've tried and tried to redeem my code and used the customer service form on AvengersAssembleOffer.com multiple times with no response. If you were thinking of upgrading for these bonuses, I'd stick to the two-disc version."
3,Bored...,"All my relatives like it, what's wrong with me! I don't like it, bored. Even ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" better. Poor me :-("
5,Great Adventure Movie,"I can't bring myself to give it five stars, but it was pretty good. The concept works a lot better than I expected. It's realistic without being cheesy. The one-liners scattered throughout combined with the purpose-driven action sequences make this movie a enjoyable experience.Updated Review as of February 1, 2013: After five or six viewings, the movie is now five stars in my book. Would definitely recommend."
5,Great Movie - Love it!,It arrived as promised in new condition! What more could one ask for? I love The Avengers! The CGI Hulk is the BEST Hulk of any film to date - more realistic looking. Others gave professional reviews on this movie so Im not going in depth on it. BUY IT! You'll be glad you did.
3,The Avengers,"Okay but not the greatest. Others really liked it. The scene with Loki and Hulk was the best. Not as good as some of the other animated comics, i.e. the hulk, ironman, etc."
2,Disappointing Special Features.,"When one purchases a Blu Ray, one expects to get some extra bang for the buck.I was waiting to see how many of the visual effects were created. I was specifically interested in Mark Ruffalo's work on the Hulk Mo-Capture.The Blu Ray has a bare bones feature on the visual journey, but gives very little detail.For all of the hype of the release, I expected more.Five Stars for the movie 2 for the treatment on Blu Ray.One Day Later.......I purchased the Target release of the Blu Ray.It contains a Bonus disk with a 90min behind the scenes feature called ""Creating a Cinematic Universe""While it doesn't make up for the lack of technical behind the scenes features on the main disk, I suppose it is better than nothing.It also did not cost any extra."
5,great action,"what action, and beyond imagination story..great actors, super story line..and I will watch this one over and over too..even my grqand children like this one..."
3,I was bored,"It's the usual smash-em-up nonsense here, with lots of loud banging and crashing for most of the more than 2-hour running time: too long, incidentally. Too many close-ups of Robert Downey Jr.'s mug inside his superhero outfit. I grew weary. The plot is the usual saving the earth from outer-space takeover nonsense. The reviews are a bit over the top. This is just another Hollywood payday for the all-star cast. Nothing special at all."
5,Awesome movie !!!,"I saw this movie in thearter, will buy or rent to see it again. Read other user's comments leave me speeachless :-)"
4,And so it begins...,It's taken several years to finally get to this point where all the movie/comic book characters come together. I'm sure it will give many more years of entertainment as the Avengers battle their foes.
5,Great hero's,"I love the avengers, Great casting and love going back to my comic days, love how the actors put there own spin on it."
2,It was all about the final battle,I had better expectation. The movie was somewhat slow. It lit up at the end with the final battle which was excellent. However before that it was very poor of content.
5,EXCELENTE,"EXCELENTE PRODUCTO, VENDIDO TAL COMO DESCRIBE EN LA WEB DE AMAZON , RECOMENDADO ESPECIALMENTE PARA QUIENES DESEEN DARSE UN REGALO Y AHORRAR AL MISMO TIEMPO"
5,Great Movie,Everything came perfectly and on time I will now continue to type to reach the word quota a a a
5,Best of all the worlds,"having the option to play blu ray, dvd, 3d and digitally is great, not to mention the movie is also a great one"
5,Great Movie,Enjoyed the movie. Hope they come out with another soonWatching it on Amazon while traveling is a bonus. Will be watching more!
3,Fabulous technical special effects presentation.,"I love super heroes. This was a bit over the top for me and quite predictable, and oh, the testosterone!"
5,Amazing,"3D is great, I have an LG 55G2 and this movie looks incredible!! When people ask to see the 3D in action I always break this movie out, hoping The Amazing Spiderman looks this good in 3D."
4,Enjoyable,"Finally a movie that brings to a head the previous solo Avenger character movies. Can't wait for a sequel, and you know it will soon be here."
3,Could have been done better,The cast enter the scene with the usual appearance or usual look. Never saw a gel of talents. This movie did not win me over.
5,Great Movie,"Really good effects and why does this require 17 words holy cow, it was a great movie, how many times do you have to day that"
4,A lot of fun to watch...,"I just dig the Avenger stuff, and this film did not disappoint. There are some disconnects with the link to Thor's universe, but just watching this group of actors makes you forget that. Weakest character is the Hulk, but have the most humorous scene in the movie. As always, Ironman steals the show. If you like state of the art digital effects, this flick is for you. Story line is just ok."
5,Love,"My favorite scenes involve Loki and Hulk, as well as Hulk in Thor. Watch it to see and you will laugh too."
3,Avengers,This movie was just ok. I did not care for it and my grandson lost interest fast. He is 5 years old.
2,Digital Copy Quality is Terrible,"While the movie is great, the digital copy is terrible. The image quality is atrocious, I could probably rip a better copy of the SD disc. Get the movie, even get it on blu-ray, but don't bother paying extra for the digital copy."
5,Love it!,This was the perfect gift for my husband. Played perfect. Nothing else really to say about it. Normal DVD that we wanted.
5,"Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, and Scarlett Johansson in 3D nough said!","Pros: 3D, cast is great, physical media is great, Scarlett JohanssonCons: Not enough Scarlett JohanssonRecommendation: men, women, children, senior citizens"
5,Liked this Movie,Liked this DVD. It was clean. It was action packed. It came on time. I sincerely appreciate clean films that our entire family can watch.
5,Excellent.,"A very good film...have watched it many times. Good story line and fabulous special effects. If you have not seen it, take the tiime."
5,Movie review,"Hands down- THE BEST superhero mOvie EVER made! Has all the ingredients of a great movie. Great character development; identifiable evil force; witty humour; cast chemistry; excellent special effects & a happy ending - all the elements for a classic, top of the line superhero film."
4,Delivery,This movie and quality for being a comic movie was nothing short of amazing. My one negative is not because of the movie but the delivery. I was excited all day at work anticipating it's arrival but did not show til 830 at night and I am usually in bed by oh well.
4,Avengers,I enjoyed this movie and recommend it for kids 12 years and older.I was only familiar with iron man and the hulk. Not sure what the other super heros do but very entertaining dialog.
5,The best movie of 2012,"I bought two of this, one for a gift for a friend and one for my collection. The price was perfect."
4,"Good action flick, better than expected.","I liked it more than I thought I would. Good action, great effects, looked good in HD quality. Four stars with no reservations."
2,overhyped,"very boring too much talking,and cheesy nonsense! all the action is at the last 25 minutes only cool thing in movie was the hulk"
5,Avengers 4 disc!,"Its an amazing combo! the packagge its 3D! i played like a child with it before opening the actual box xDThe set is nice, the movie looks great! the extras are a few, ill rather more, but enough for many.You recieve a bluray 3d, a bluray, a dvd and a Digital copy. and some surprises inside :D!"
5,Good movie,Great movie but you need to have watched all the others in the genre from this movie company to get the full benefits of how good it actually is.
4,"Amazing movie, pretty good quality","If I were only reviewing the movie, I would give it 5 stars without a doubt. I'm giving it 4 because the quality of the HD movie stream was decent, but not like a top-notch blu-ray. There were lots of scenes with smoke or clouds where there was very obvious aliasing. For the most part, the action scenes were smooth and the picture was good, but it wasn't perfect."
4,We were impressed but wished there was more...,"The movie had all the glitz, had all the glam, and special effects and CGI any 12 yr. old would flip head over heels for but as far as a story base, it just wasn't there."
4,Fun Watch,"I've become a fan of the recent Marvel movies. They are all high quality action films, and quite fun to watch, if not exactly high brow entertainment. Avengers is no different. Entertaining from start to finish."
5,Best super hero movie.,"Great action, pacing and effects. Story is well written. You should watch other movies for best satisfaction out of the series."
3,Marvel's The Avengers,This movie didn't play very well it start then stop and the last half hour we never got to see because the movie stop and didn't start back again.
2,What a waste of time.,"One star better than Sylvester Stallone and The Expendables, I'll say that. But, it's close. Seriously, just don't watch this movie."
4,Great ensemble action film,"With all the bad super hero films of the last few years it is nice to see a good one. I had reservation about this film as I liked Thor and Captain America on their own, but I liked them I did not love them. Iron Man 1 I enjoyed much more than 2 and the Hulk... Hmm... I like the TV show best. But when they all came together it was a very enjoyable film with some quick witted dialogue that added some levity to the very long run time. I would recommend watching all of the films that lead up to this first, but it does hold its' own without... you just miss some key elements along the way."
5,I looked forward to this movie since 1980.,"This was a great movie. There was a great balance between acting, action, and storyline that will make this enjoyable for older comic book fans, and new moviegoers. I was happy with Banner's character, even though it wasn't Norton, Ruffallo did a great job; oh, and Hulk looked his best this time around. Captain America was the same guy from the comic book, which I appreciated that they didn't change him. The tension was there, and so was the camaraderie from the comics. Now I'm just waiting to see what's next!"
4,sandmansays,"Love this movie saw it three times on the big screen. I find the movie full of action, heart, and even a funny side. The hulk makes the movie and if you haven't seen it I think you should."
3,Average super hero movie,"The movie had a quick line that took a jab at adoption. Adopted kid's feelings might be hurt. This was only one line in the movie though.Aside from that, it's your typical superhero movie with excessive violence and the female hero, Black Widow, resorting to exploiting her sexuality to meet her goals.Am I the only one who's tired of women always having to whore themselves in movies in order to be powerful?"
3,Avengers,Avengers continues in the genre of comic book super heroes adapted to the big and small screen. Lots of action and special effects without much of a plot aside from Good versusEvil.
3,Marvel's Avengers,"Another in the seemingly countless number of mindless action-adventure movies released each year. For a mindless action-adventure movie it is one of the better ones. It is unique in its mindlessness in that there are several shallow characters rather than one or two. The action-adventure is unique in that the weapons are not just the same as the weapons in the others of this ilk, the weapons are sometimes super powers. That is pretty much it."
3,Superheroes Romp,"Lots of action but predictable results. Some good humor. Needs more character development, story line and ambiguity. Like a good comic book."
5,Good,it was Good. a be see dee e ef gee ach i jay kay el em en o pee qu are es tee you vee doubleu ex why zee
4,weird,"Hahaha You're little bit late :P It have been released in Sweden already (2012-09-05). I thought Ameirca was the first one with release dates, especially with their own movies :S But not this time. I wonder why?Anyway. This movie was awesome :D All the heros you wanna see is in there!"
1,NO SPECIAL FEATURES ON DVD,"i for one loved the movie, however i am very disappointed in the dvd release. once again the dvd has no speial features at all and blu ray gets everything. why bother even putting it on dvd. just make this exclusive to blu ray since those who do not have blu ray get ripped off. why waste our time."
3,a little dis appointed,"The movie is a good movie not great. It made a lot of money beating out Harry potter in revenues. How I don't know. Ii was a little board at some points of the movie and if u watched Thor, how did they figure out to get Thor to earth when he destroyed the only way to get off his planet. Could have been better for me."
1,Boring,"I agree with others that say the movie itself was really boring and dull. I don't understand how so many people LOVED IT!It took a LONG time for the story to get going, and then when it did it was a very repetitious series of explosions and an unlimited number of creatures destroying NYC, for no apparent reason. It seemed to go on and on forever and ever. It was like watching paint dry. Ugh!I really enjoyed Iron Man I and II. Robert Downey junior is an excellent actor and those movies were at least interesting and fun. I thought this one would be along those lines. Nah. Scarlet Johansen is really pretty, and captain america is pretty buff, so they tried to please both the male and female audience, but the plot was dull, dull dull."
3,HUGE SUMMER MOVIE BUT VERY OVERRATED,After seeing this movie on the big screen and with all of the hype I must say I was very let down and hugely disappointed. It takes forever to get going and is just plain slow for to much of the movie. It's worth a rental for sure so you can judge for yourself but I just was expecting so much more bang or the buck.
2,The Cup Cake Avengers,"This is the most over rated movie ever made.People on Amazon who has rated this movie over 2 stars must think Dancing with the Stars is the best show ever on tv.The Avengers is all about CGi. There is no plot, wait a minute ! A man who wants to take over Earth is the plot..WTF.? It's crazy this movie made lots of money."
4,Good action movie,"Good movie and streamed well through Amazon. Lots of great action scenes. That said, I have a short attention span & the movie is LONG which is the sole reason I probably will not watch it again."
5,Avengers Review,"Avengers was a great choice. For only 20 dollars to get a soundtrack, 3D blu ray, blu ray, and digital copy, it is tough to not feel like you received a great value."
2,Some of these types of movies can be fun.,"This movie was alright, Robert Downey just does not seem to make a bad movies as his acting is really good. Would probably not get the sequel is made."
2,Poor Quality,"The picture quality was very bad. You could see the pixels in the picture and was blurry. Also it cut off with 20 minutes left to go in the movie, so we just stopped watching it."
4,surprising,"I admit I was skeptical at first especially with as many big personalities as there are in this; however, I found that the action sequences weren't cheap in their production and was mostly believable rather than some that are insanely overdone(I'm thinkin bout you Transformers 3). They actually had a good story line as well and tied all the characters together well and didn't focus too awful much on just one character. Unfortunately, I am unsure in what ways a sequel would measure up and how this effects other superhero productions that feature just one."
3,Movie was great but....,I love the movie but the sound was terrible. The voices were super low but the music super loud. Seemed like a bad illegal copy.
2,Marvel's The Avengers,"The action was good ,had great seens and color, but the audio was so low that I could not hear it without turning the volume way up."
4,Avengers - Technically impressive,I'm not one for these types of movies but I must admit that I enjoyed the movie especially the technical aspects and character humor. I was pleasantly surprised.
4,Fun,"Fun movie if you like the whole super hero thing, which I do. After watching this, go back and watch Iron Man 2 and others and you'll notice anew references and people that work their way into this movie."
5,AVENGAAAAAS!,"THE AVENGERS IS AN AWESOME MOVIE AND THE BLURAY IS EVEN BETTER, EVERYONE SHOULD GET IT FOR IT IS STUPENDOUS, SPECTACULAR, TREMENDOUS AND EXHILLERATING. IT IS THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE OF THE YEAR BESIDES DARK KNIGHT RISES AND AMAZING SPIDERMAN"
2,"Rating for item, not movie.",Digital Copy is not HD. Blu-Ray movies should come with HD digital copies and DVD should come with SD copies. This isn't rocket science folks.
3,"Blu-ray has all the special features, dvd does not","I love this film. I bought the blu-ray/dvd combo because, while I do not have a blu-ray yet, I wanted to see the deleted scenes & the gag reel. When you check the comparison page, it says the combo has all of the special features found on the 4 disc set. Imagine my surprise when the dvd has none of those special features....they are only on the blu-ray disc. The dvd has only audio commentary & a feature about the making of the film.I am not pleased."
2,Can I return?,"The packaging was damaged. The movie showed up way later then expected. Just overall wasn't impressed with service. Wish I would of bought somewhere else, could of got a better deal."
4,It's ok,"Nothing super exciting, just a bunch of action packed comics that provide some hours of entertainment.Some people may like it more than others though."
4,The Avengers,"Enjoyed the movie - well done action from start to finish. Plenty of one-liners, which added a lot of laughs. Watched it twice, and enjoyed it both times!"
5,Great movie.,This Blu-ray has a lot of great extras plus it comes with a DVD version of the movie!! Very glad I got it.
5,Action movie of the year!,This movie was great fun! But I'm biased because I'm a Marvel fan. If you love Marvel movies Avengers needs to be included in your collection.
3,One very fast paced movie ***,"This is the kind of movie you need to see 2 times and if you not seen the others like The Hulk, Iron man, et al then you will get lost. As stated it is very fast so don't blink you will miss the action over all it was good but might have been better if they had some more bad guys and or good guys like Spider Man or Fan 4, Who knows this may work into a sequel time will tell. I give it 3 stars and would have gone to 4 except of it fast pace and needed to slow down once again awhile."
5,Avengers!,"The movie is an instant classic, all the characters are portrayed well and the suspense/action/humor are all as good as expected."
3,"If you're into Marvel superheros, you'll love it","I rented this on Amazon streaming for my son, who really liked Iron Man. The movie has a ridiculous plot (don't they all?), but credit has to be given to the actors, who are almost believable, except for the stoic Captain America who could be replaced by a cardboard cutout with detracting from the film. The special effects and CGI get five stars, with amazing detail and remarkable action sequences. Samuel Jackson does a fantastic job of playing, well, Samuel L. Jackson.Some of the scenes are quite violent which make the movie unsuitable for younger, sensitive viewers.Amazon streaming gets 1 star, as it seems to ""hiccup"" if you pause the movie. I've noticed this on all of their streaming videos, and it makes me hesitant to rent from Amazon."
5,Another Good Action Flick,"What can I say. I love action flicks, and Robert Downey Jr. has become one of my favorite action movie actors. Who'd of thought!! I loved it."
5,AWESOME MOVIE!,"I got a $5 gift card from Amazon for the trial of Amazon Prime. So I decided to use it on this movie. 3 words: Money Well Spent. This movie is action packed, has very funny scenes, and a great plot! I recommend you to either rent it or buy it! You'll Love it. 5 STARS *****"
4,Very Good-But Could Have Been Better,"This movie will fill your quota when it comes to an action movie, but will fall a wee bit short on story line. But it is well worth the rental fee."
5,The Best one yet!,This one is the best one yet! Full of action and funny too! I should have purchased it. Will wait until the prices come down and buy it so I can watch it again.
4,It's great,It kept me interested till the end. I would enjoy another one. Downey could be our new action hero in any movie he makes.
5,The best Marvel movie yet!,I really enjoyed Marvel comics as a child and these movies bring that enjoyment into the 21st century. I hope I get this as a present for Chrismas. The instant view rental on Amazon worked flawlessly.
4,Good movie,"Although the review is for the service more than the movie, just thought will mention it :-)Not an issue making the purchase or even accessing the prime option on my tv. I did have an issue during the streamline of the movie and I have checked with my Internet provider and doesn't seem to be their problem... Who knows. In any case, it was easy to get and the picture and sound was as great as being at the movies."
5,fantastic movie!!,"Very, very good movie, pretty much the best of the buch of marvel lately, thor, captain america and iron man. Not talking about the amazing spiderman, if you read something good about that movie, most likely the studio pay for that review, is just awful, there is no way someone really liked the amazing spiderman or said it was better that the tobey maguire movies, anyway.The avengers is well written, good actors, and truly pays homage to its source, the comics books, highly recommended."
2,mmm...,"there was a problem with the movie, the blue ray one is just perfect, works awesome, the digital copy obviously is perfect, the problem is the DVD one, It starts to jump in betwin the movie, and in on e point on the best part of the fight it just got stuck, unfortunately I'm unable to ask for a change, but is a good point for you to take care off."
3,My granson liked this movie.,"I guess it takes someone interested in fantasy heroes to get through this DVD. That's not me, but my grandson thought it was a really good movie. I gave it an extra star for my grandson's interest in this DVD."
5,Great Movie!,"I bought this for a friend who loves comic books, and he definitely appreciates it. Made me become a superhero fan!"
5,Very good movie,This movie was action packed and the special effects were awesome. It also had a good story. Robert Downey was charming as usual.
3,Didn't liked it but bought it,"When I first watched it in Korea (3D IMAX), I didn't liked it.I think it is because so many super heroes are fighting with only one evil just didn't appealed for me.Then I watched it again in the US in 3D. I didn't liked it again.Kida boring.Most of the super hero movie, I like. But this one, no.But i bought it because it is one of the biggest hit film historically.I guess I owned it just because of that reason.The picture quality is super sharp.And the sound is 7.1 HD channel.All in all owning it in Bluday if you like this movie."
5,Amazing,"3D is okay at times, awesome during most of the movie.All in all, an awesome movie. Recommend to anysuperhero fan."
2,ehhh,"it was ok, i mean with these movies you kind of know what you are getting. Better than the Amazing Spider Man, but so is a blank screen."
3,entertaining,"purely entertaining, good to watch with your kid, not something that I would go out of my way to watch though"
3,No box came,"I really loved this film but not the fact it only came with a sleve and not the collector`s box,which I will have to get one made or buy this again from a retailer"
3,Great movie,Hey great story and great special effects in the movie. It came in on scheduled. The price was better than found in the stores.
2,I rented the wrong movie,It wasn't rented for me it was rented for a man who likes the series of the show what ever the show or books are
2,Cinematic equivalent of McDonald's,"We shut this off about 45 minutes into it. Like McDonald's ""food"", there's a lot of pablum that kids will like, but adults with any sort of palate should steer clear. Thor was pleasant eye candy, though."
5,greatest Marvel movie yet,"I really loved this movie!! When I first heard about it, I was expecting something like an Iron Man 2.5. I AM SO GLAD TO BE WRONG!!! It has the perfect blend of figures, the story has very good pace and it shows the good and dark sides of all the characters. Great Loki, portrayed perfectly, and a great Iron man, Black Widow and Hulk. Love the Hellicarrier, a real treat for the fans. Great view and great buy"
5,Family Favorite!,"Excellent story, really well done. We're looking forward to the next one! As far as family friendliness, we think it's appropriate for our 9 year-old boy and older. The scary parts aren't too scary, the violence isn't gory, and the lewdness is almost non-existent. Language is mild, with most of it coming from Robert Downy Jr."
5,Great fun!,"I was a Marvel reader for many years when I was younger so this is a real treat. Many of the characters were launched in other movies so you didn't have to wait around for their origin stories. This movie launches right in to the action and doesn't stop. The plot is good, the characters and effects are great, and the humor really shines through. Can't wait for the next one!"
4,Great movie!,I downloaded this flick to my Kindle Fire. it made for a really quick plane flight to NY. Would definitely recommend this!
3,"Nice action, thin plot","As a kid, Capt Marvel was a favorite comic book hero, and I've enjoyed all the recent movies made about other Marvel heroes. So I was really looking forward to The Avengers, where many of them were brought together. However, I was disappointed. I didn't think the plot lived up to the standards those previous movies...the plot seemed like an excuse for the action, ending with a justification for The Avengers, Part 2. Perhaps I just getting old, but I think they could have done better."
5,Fantastic Movie,I am new to loving these types of action movies and this one is OVER THE TOP fantastic. Love the actors/characters and after went and watched all the other movies of the individual heros. The best is Iron Man - gotta love him! GREAT movie - my 10 year old son watched it and I'm usually pretty protective over what he watches - a few things were a little violent but overall ok and he loved it.
5,Best action movie ever.,"This is the undisputed best action movie I've ever seen. The Hulk was incredible and easily the most gratifying piece of the movie. It's the Hulk you always wanted him to be (fearsome, powerful and uncontrollable). All the others were written with incredible skill and vision and thrown together masterfully in epic action sequences that seemed purposeful, meaningful and fitting. The actors all owned their respective parts and everything just fits together in a way that makes you more than willing to cheer out loud in more than one place. Excellent work from beginning to end."
4,My boys loved this,"Language is decent, the women could be dressed a little less provocative, not a lot of blood despite the violence."
5,This is what superhero movies are supposed to be like!,"I really, really liked this movie. Great acting, great replication of the look and feel of the comic book, and incredible special effects. Oh yes, and it was a great plot as well!"
5,Can't wait for the second one.,It lived up to the hype and well beyond that. can't wait for the second to come out. Mark Ruffalo gets two thumbs up for his performance of the Hulk
5,Super Fun,"This is only my second Blu-Ray DVD that I own. I was not really a big fan of the Super Hero's. But I had taken my 8 year old Nephew to see the movie and was instantly hooked on them. It is absolutely a fun and entertaining movie one that I have watched more than 5 dozen times already. Though I have never seen the other individual movies about the Super Hero's but after watching this, I will be watching the others for sure. I would recommend this movie to anyone, that's how good it is."
5,Fantastic,"I look forward to watching the Avengers repeatedly. The special effects, story, interplay between the characters and passion for justice are appealing."
5,200 Million Dollar Opening,"Seen this movie twice already and it was just as enjoyable the second time. This is such a well done movie with plenty of awesome action, intensity and some great one liners. The way the movie builds up to one of the most bad @$$ battles I have ever seen is just perfect. So much tension between all the super heroes and the way they come together gave me goosebumps. Highly recommended if you haven't seen this yet and I would say see it multiple times because you will just want to!"
4,Fun,"Captain America, Thor, and the others working together. What's not to like. Funny parts make the movie. It is worth buying to watch again."
2,"Movie great, download in SD","I find this product description to be misleading. There is nothing to indicate that the digital download is SD. When a movie is purchased as a set that includes two HD versions (including 3D), and specifically advertises a digital download as a 4th disc in a 4 disc set, it reasonable to assume that the digital download is HD, unless stated otherwise. Yet when I entered the code through iTunes (one of 2 given options, the other being Windows Media Player), I received the SD version, whether or not I downloaded directly to my iPad or though iTunes. The HD version is available for purchase through iTunes.The movie is great, but I was stuck watching it in SD in a hotel, so this product is not. If I had known the digital copy was SD, I would have just bought the HD digital version through Amazon or iTunes, not the set, as my personal preference is digital."
2,Special features are PATHETIC!,"This was, without a doubt, one of the best movies I've ever seen. But this release gets 2 stars in my book because the LACK of any kind of meaningful special features. No 'making of' featurette, which is damn near standard in ANY release as HUGE as this one, and the other offerings are anemic at best. If they end up adding more extras to a later release to try go get me to buy yet ANOTHER 'Avengers' DVD, as did the constantly re-released with yet ANOTHER special feature 'Lord of the Rings', they will be sadly disappointed. I'm sick of studios using this kind of tactic to squeeze the possible last nickel out of consumers. And this feels like just this kind of setup.A sad offering here."
2,No bang for your buck - dvd version,"I have yet to see The Avengers, sad to say. I was really looking forward to getting the DVD. But now, why bother? I'll rent it via the LIBRARY for free because NOTHING is coming with it! Why do all the extras only come out on blue-ray? What gives? I don't have a blue-ray and nor do I plan to. This DVD should cost $10 TOPS because that is all you are getting - THE MOVIE. What a rip off! And why include all the extras in different formats? How hard can it be to add an extra dvd with all the extras?! I hope someone uploads them onto youtube for me. I love watching gag reals and ""making of"".Really disappointed here."
2,Unfair to dvd users,"I am severely disappointed that all of the truly great special features are blu-ray only. This is a great movie and dvd users deserve to enjoy the same special features as the blu-ray users. Seriously? The dvd only has one featurette and a commentary? That SUCKS. I don't want to have to buy a blu-ray player, just so I can see the special features. I know this is just entertainment, but I do feel kinda bitter about this. I think both formats should get equal treatment. This is very unfair to a lot of faithful customers. I was waiting on pins and needles for this to come out, partially for the deleted scenes and gag reel. Now, I know I'll still be missing out, after Tuesday. Sad."
1,DECEPICIONADO!!!!!!!,"ESTOU DECEPICIONADO.NO DIA 28/9/2012,EFETUEI A COMPRA DE CINCO PRODUTOS,UM FOI ENTREGUE A OS OUTROS AINDA NO,POIS A ENTREGA JÁ ESTA ATRASADA.A PREVISO DE ENTREGA ERA PARA O DIA 15/10/2012.JÁ ESTAMOS NO DIA 21/10/2012.AGUARDO RESPOSTAS OBRIGADO.OBRIGADO PELOS ELOGIOS MAS ,AGUARDO RESPOSTAS DOS MEUS PRODUTOS QUE AINDA NO RECEBI."
3,Let down...,"Don't get me wrong-it was good. However, I had high expectations and had hoped for it to be GREAT. Friends and family told me it was great, but I though it was just good. Definitely entertaining and visually stimulating though."
1,Wrong Aspec Raito,"Why oh Why do they keep releasing movies shot in 185.1 in the 178.1 aspect ratio it's wrong stop it release the movie the same as it was filmed, get over the black bars............."
1,Very disappointing!,"I was so excited to see this movie, especially since the reviews were so good. But what movie were they watching? A flying aircraft carrier? There is nothing cool or clever about that! Combine that with terrible acting and twenty minutes of lame 3D effects and all I could do from preventing myself from crying over the money I spent on this movie was to laugh. Honestly I wanted to turn this movie off several times, but i had to wait for the action or something interesting to happen - well that never happen! Now all I can do is hope I can get some of my wasted money back and try to sell this ""bomb"" to a used discount store. So to sum it up - save your money and be glad you did."
4,loved it,Loved everything about it. There was action and comedy and the characters were great. Loved the fact that you could recognize Cleveland landmarks throughout the movie
5,The Avengers,excellent.action-packed and a lot of very good superhero type fun.if you are searching for a little break from reality this movie will give you a great ride.
3,A good set up.,This movie is a good set up for the Avengers franchise. There are moments in this movie that seem a little forced and awkward. A good start for all involved.
5,"Excellent product, excellent service","I bought this from amazon.com for delivery to the UK because Disney shafted us on the special features over here. This edition is multi region so played without a problem on my region B player. It also worked out cheaper after conversion from $ to than it would've done to buy it in the UK anyway- including shipping! It arrived in a reasonable time, but I was refunded because it was 2 days later than expected. Just brilliant service, cheap and helpful, and the product itself is a load of great features and a thoroughly entertaining piece of popcorn cinema. I didn't stretch to the 4 disc because I don't care for 3D but if you do it's a bit of a bargain really. Well done amazon.com, now lets get to work on fixing Disney's UK distribution and European market prices.So you might have to wait a bit longer to get it from amazon.com rather than .co.uk, but you get a better price and a better version of the product (the Whedon commentary is a must have)."
4,download of avengers,Very good movie download option very nice. this was the first time I used that option from Amazon. I only had one hick-up with the download.All and all I would concider using this format. again. Price should be lower to compete and cloae out the redbox business plan. even lowering the download cost by a dollar would stop my family feom using redbox.$1.36. per night at Redbox with driving to the box and back again to return. Compare that to $3.99. for 48 hours with no drive. If they lowered new movies to $2.99 for 48 hours would win hands down.
4,Awesome movie,The best super hero movie ever. Packaging is lame though for a four disc blu-ray set. The movie deserves 5 stars but the packaging deserves better for such a great movie.
5,Can I give this 6 stars?,"Love, love, love this movie! All my favorite Marvel heroes assembled in one place? Hell yes! The Blu-Ray presentation looks and sounds amazing. I haven't had time to go through all the bonus materials, but it appears there's plenty to keep a nerd like myself occupied."
3,Terrible sound on the Amazon Digital Rental,"The movie was decent - about what you'd expect. But the sound quality was terrible. The movie was turned all the way up to the highest volume and it was still hard to decipher what people were saying. Fix this issue, Amazon!"
5,The Avengers is crazy good,"Movie is awesome first and foremost. Best Marvel movie to date. The combo pack is cool with both Blu Ray and DVD. All the special features are on the Blu Ray disc, so just remember that. Nice to know I can take this movie anywhere and watch it with any player."
1,avengers rental dvd,"I have a 52 inch plasma tv got a picture of about the size of a 25 inch tv borders on all 4 sides very bad! If this is how on demand thru amazon is going to be never order again will go and buy the blue ray this weekend,what a waste of money and time,very very unhappy!"
1,"First time and might be the last time. Poor HD quality, chappy had to restart several times.","First time and might be the last time. Poor HD quality, chappy had to restart several times. I think i'll stick with my crappy netflix serivce. At least I get to watch my movies complete,"
2,SOOOOOOO LAME!!!,"SO DUMB, yes I get it's a comic book movie, and I get the fantasy aspect of it, the problem is the acting, it is among the most contrived and forced performances I have ever seen. So bad, so so bad. Thor is horrible, Captain America even worse, Iron Man acceptable, only character worth a crap is Mark Ruffalo's Hulk, and he even struggles, some of these guys are great actor, yet they seem like they are cringing at their own words, as if they can not believe they are being forced to say this awful dialogue. Action and FX are great of course, but at two and half hours it is torture to sit through the other crap."
1,"Great movie, inferior sound","I love this movie. The one star rating is for the sound. I bought this on instant video. For the price I paid, I expect to get Dolby Digital, just as I would on the DVD had I purchased it (sure wish I had). What I got was lousy stereo sound. I am surprised Amazon treats their instant video customers this way. Needless to say I will not be purchasing any more instant videos from them. You live, you learn. Here is a good slogan for Amazon Instant Video. Expect better, get less. Least they could do is warn you on the order page. Oh well, lesson learned.Update: I checked out Vudu.com. All my movies on there, including Standard Definition ones, are in Dolby Digital 5.1+. Not sure what the plus means but I now know the Vudu.com is the place to buy your digital movies if you want decent sound for your money. No, I do not work for them, nor do I have any interest in their business. I do however have a keen interest in high quality sound."
1,Unplayable,"I ordered and received a copy of Marvel's Avengers 4-Disc combo pack last weekend. I put the 3D disc in and there was a pulse-like hesitation throughout the entire movie. I sent it back and asked for another copy that I could actually watch. Amazon was very good and easy to work with. They sent the replacement out to me in two days and the process for return was very simple. Unfortunately, the new DVD was also defective with the same problem. I don't know if anyone else has experienced this problem, but I hope you will inform Amazon if you do. I would like very much to watch this movie in 3D, but they all may be defective."
3,"Poor Sound Quality, Decent Movie","The movie itself was entertaining, but the sound quality on the HD Amazon Prime was awful. We had to turn our volume all the way up and could still not hear as well as we would like. Never had this problem with any other Amazon Prime movies."
4,The Avengers 3D,"The packaging could have been better, an HD iTunes Digital Copy would have made it so much better! Otherwise is was pretty good!"
5,avengers,excellent video the actors did an exceptional job. the fight scenes were very realistic. overall a wonderful time to loose ones self for awhile.
4,Decent movie. Not Iron Man,This movie will appease your appetite until Iron man 3 comes out. It was well done and if your a fan you will enjoy it. I didnt find it as entertaining as the Iron man movies however.
5,Great Movie!,Saw it in theaters and just knew that we would buy it and view it again. It is a long enough movie that you don't feel overwhelmed with the star-studded cast. They do well to make a good story.
4,"""Thor "" Keeps Shirt ON...","All of you who are female or gay men...NO ""Thor"" does NOT take of his shirt in ""Marvels, The Avengers"""
4,Pretty good action film,"Movie was good. I did not see the first Avengers movie, so I didn't have any background, but I am familiar with the characters. It was good (although some things were pretty dumb, like Thor falling for the Loki thing in the chamber), but at some points I was sitting on the edge of my seat."
2,Disappointed with the disc cover,Amazon give great service no doubt.The review is for the product.It's a hobby for me to collect blu ray.As title say the disc was just pale blue with name on it. For that price I would expect a picture in the disc. Just a suggestion next time put the image of the disc. totally disappointed for the price i paid. on the other hand fully satisfied with the Italian Job.BTW: no digital copy for that price! I miss understood and purchased it. I always prefer digital copy coz its a hobby.
2,predictable,Downey should stick with Ironman movies only. This was not a great flick. Plot line was very predictable and not worthy of Downey's talent.
2,Need a stronger plot.,"Movies with tons of special effects often lose site of the plot. Although this movie has a plot, it was a weak one to begin with and not very credible."
3,Good Action Flick,"Good action film without any storyline. It's a film most young people (under 25 and male) will find entertaining. If you've got a spare 2 hrs to kill, it's okay."
5,AWESOME!!!,I had been waiting forever to finally watch this movie and it did not disappoint. LOVED IT!! Bringing in all the Marvel characters from the other movies was wonderful. They all played so well off of each other. Loved the new characters too.
2,Second screen failure,The second screen does not interface as proclaimed. I have BD live player with Ipad. Maybe somebody at Disney can explain why it is not functioning properly
4,Very few dull moments,"There were a couple spots where I thought it was a tad slow. However, there were great effects and good character interaction."
4,Avengers,Really a fast pace movie with a great story line. If you enjoy sci fi movies you will REALLY enjoy this one.
4,"Great, but not the best","This movie was really great it was awesome!! but i have to say that when it comes to action, only the end is full of it. the begining of the film is kind of boring and they talk to much! but still the movie was great and i had a blasth, now i have to say it wasnt better than THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, that movie was a whole lot better"
1,"Rating For Streaming Video, NOT Movie Itself","The movie was great! Unfortunately, the audio quality on the HD streaming video I bought was so horrible it almost ruined the movie. I had it cranked on my TV to max volume and still could barely make out some of the dialogue, so I had to keep rewinding the movie to catch what I missed.REALLY disappointed in the quality of the product delivered to me!"
4,Great Family Movie Night,"Its real hard for us to all enjoy a movie together. Son who is 10, daughter 12 and daughter 19. To find a movie that they, and my wife and I also want to watch, let alone like, is hard to do. The avengers movie was a great choice. Action packed, funny, ""family friendly"" and a good movie. Special effects in HD are awesome and sometimes seemed real. Robert Downey Jr. stole the show for my kids with his sarcastic humor. A great movie night. Only reason for 4 stars, not 5, is that the movie is a bit long. I think it was 2 hours 22 minutes."
5,Avengers Assemble,"What can I say? This is to date the best movie rendition of the comic book world ever! Growing up my fav hero was always a toss-up between Thor, Captain America, and Ironman, after seeing this it might come down to Hulk, LoL. Buy it, its fun based on a clean art, comic books."
1,The Blue Ray disc can not be viewed in the player. Get stuck most times. Only played the DVD copy,The Blue Ray disc can not be viewed in the player. Get stuck most times. Only played the DVD copy
3,Meh,"It's not horrendous, but there is just so little value in these kinds of movies anymore. There's nothing here to encourage people in any kind of moral behavior, which I shouldn't be surprised about, and I'm becoming convinced that it's not good for people to live in fantasy all the time anyway. I recommend finding a better way of wasting your time..."
1,Froze,"I downloaded the movie, but was unable to watch it because it never loaded on my Kindle. Very frusterated on a 6 hour flight with no movie to watch."
1,"Great movie, but","Dont get me wrong, the movie itself is great. It's just that the DVD copy skips a scene. Like it stops and skips the scene. Malfunction. My sister, who got it from a retailer said the same thing on the same scene. (it's when black widow is with Bruce banner and he turns into Hulk for the first time in the movie)"
3,highly overated,We were bored and disappointed.It was all action and special effects and a silly comic book story. Why didn't Thor take time to visit Natalie Portman? The Iron Man movies were much better. I always did think Captain America was a screwy concept. Kind of like Batman fighting with Superman.
5,Amazing,"Great movie, I would rent it again. It was just like watching it in theaters all over again. :) <3"
5,Best Super Hero movie of all time!,This is the best superhero movie of all time. The action is great. The special effects and characters leave you wanting a sequel and the humor make it enjoyable for the whole family.
4,Avenger extras let down....,"Just got the Avengers 4 Disc Bluray. LOVE the film, can't get enough of it. But sad to say I'm very dissappointed about the extras included. Considering this film is the flagship of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you only get a Joss Whedon commentary (very informative), a gag reel, deleted scenes and 2 VERY short featureettes. I know all the characters have been dealt with in the previous releases, but here there's not even a featurette that could maybe have dealt with the history of the Avengers team itself (and such a rich history it is - since 1963). Apparently on a UK version you can get at Sainsbury's supermarkets, there's a 90 minute Documentary on the rise of Marvel Studios. Even that would have been good. Again, LOVE the film (5 STARS) but very dissappointed with the extras...."
4,great,saw this in theatre and am glad to have my own copy of this it was great. great show with wonderful special effects
4,Extremely enjoyable all-star Marvel comics blowout,"This is a high-quality sequel with intelligent contributions from the writers, actors, and director Joss Whedon. The development of the characters, from Samuel L. Jackson's one-eyed, growling Nick Fury to Chris Evans idealistic Captain America to Robert Downey's smart-aleck Ironman learning to play well with others, reflects what made Marvel special in the first place. The action scenes are like seeing a big, graphically rich comic page come to life. And it's not just action; there are quite unexpected plot twists. My only caveat is that the bad guys' motivation seems a little thin (apparently they're just bad). Loki seems to suffer from the conventional movie-script father conflict (yawn). But, after all, the good guys are the main attraction, and they're -- well, super!"
4,Great Movie!!!!,"Loved it! Story was good, action was awesome, and the effects were just right. This review process is a little annoying though!"
5,Absolutely the best comic book movie of 2012,"If you have an opportunity to see Marvel's the Avengers, do so. Not only does this film have a great storyline, but also incredible special effects. The cast is excellent, the action is non-stop, and it will be well worth the price. If you have Blu-ray, you will definitely have more little bells and whistles for your viewing pleasure, but definitely get this movie. It's worth it."
2,It was ok!,"The movie was alright, Will only watch it once!! That's all for this movie, it not for little kids!! Not a women movie!"
5,Awesome Film,Film depicts all the Avengers at once is does a very good job at it. The characters are believable and the story is rich with graphics and action for the entire family. Hulk character was well done compared to the other movies with this character in them. Over all a solid performance by all.
4,Good for what it is,"This movie is pretty good if you accept it for what it is and don't expect much by way of story, acting, dialogue, etc. Basically, this movie is a prolonged battle scene after a slow and uninteresting first half. That said, the big battle is VERY cool. There are a few good one-liners as well. I was disappointed that the movie uses the Thor/Loki thing to drive the story. I thought Thor was the least well-done of the movies and the least interesting of the characters. Still, the movie is good fun for anyone who ever picked up a comic book or watched cartoons when they were a kid.Anyway, they sure did make a lot of money so I'm sure they will come out with another movie just like this one...Recommended."
4,"Exciting, Hilarious",This was hilarious from the beginning. All of these guys working with each other to accomplish their goal was hilarious.
4,Thanks for doing what you said...,A W E S O M E ! ! !Definitely 4 out of 5 stars (easily). Arrived as foretold.
5,Could This Movie Be Better? Perhaps...,"I loved the Iron Man movies and love this movie! Sure, some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy, but it's a superhero flick; I pretty much expect that. So it could be a bit better as far as dialogue goes, but I don't buy many movies and I purchased this one a few days after it came out on DVD. Great movie!"
5,Cant wait for number 2,"I had the privlege of seeing this before the day before it was released since I was a movie theater employee. What I had called the ""Rag-doll scene"" (and so did many others once it was released) got tons of laughs from myself and from my co-workers. There were plenty more scenes that matched this laug throughout the film. Word of the wise, there are two post credit scenes!"
3,I expected better dialogue,I wanted better dialogue and less action. But they went with more action.. It was good. Not great. That's what you get for going into a movie with expectations.
5,This movie is so cool...,"Can't wait for the next one to be filmed. This was so cool as a combination of all the individual movies. Would like to see more individual movies, as well."
4,Exciting,Good movie sequel to the other Stan Lee projects. The actors were well cast and the sets were great. The special effects were incredible.
3,"Fun, once exposition was over","Perhaps over hyped, The Avengers was a fun movie but not anywhere near the quality of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy. It seemed to take a long time to get going with so much exposition required first. Always a difficult task to appeal to those who know the comic books (I don't) and those who don't, perhaps a Marvel fan would give the movie a much higher rating. The stand out actor/character in the movie was Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk."
5,ginny,"Loved the movie! Watched it with my son. The movie was just what I thought it should be, very exciting and full of action. The animation was great!"
4,Avengers Movie Review,"I personally liked some of the individual movies more than the Avengers, but hubby loved it. The actor that plays the Hulk does a wonderful job, but I didn't like what they did with Tony Stark's character. I liked his character better in Iron Man."
5,Avengers,"I am a action adventure movie kind of guy, as well as my son (single parent). I go to the movies or certain TV shows as a kind of escape. I like to indulge in these movies like a rollercoaster ride....take me away! This movie is super fun, plenty of action and smart remark comments that tickles the funny bone. I have to admit that ""Avengers"" is my new (FAV.)top pick Action/Adventure movie. - got the two(2)pack combo Blu-ray disc! It's that awesome. Entertaining, not many movie I'd watch more than a couple of times. Avengers I can actually watch anytime I need a shot of movie adrenaline. Simply, ""Beast"" as my son would say!"
4,Great movie,"Great movie, crystal-clear on Blu-Ray. Kind of disappointed in the lack of extras, though. Could have done without the 3-D version for some additional special stuff."
5,Wow,"I can not wait to see the next movie, great cast, good plot. plenty of action through out the show."
4,Lots of action,Interesting devolopment of the Marval characters. Liked it more than we thought we would. Probably not good for small children.
5,Marvel's The Avengers on blu ray,"Not only is this the best comic book movie EVER, it looks fantastic on blu ray. The special features are good, too. But there could be more. It's this generation's Star Wars. Not so much the effects (which are danm good) but because of the scope of this film and unexpected box office success. If you have not seen this movie yet, due yourself a favor and at least rent it. It's just a fun movie."
3,Movie,Did great as using my first time on instant video. Although I lost interest in the movie half way though
4,Entertaining,"This was an entertaining movie, but not my favorite out of all the comic book films. It's definitely worth watching."
4,Marvels The Avengers...,"This will be good fun, especially for those of us who grew up in the era where these comic book characters were our TV ...."
5,Avengers is Amazing!,"I still can't believe I got this for less than $17. Amazon ad matched Target, and I was able to snag the 4 disc combo set for far less then I should have. No issues with this product, all the blu-ray quality is superb and the extras are quite nice."
5,Love it.,"Love the movie, love that it came with the digital copy. The blu-ray looks great, just hoping to find some more time to watch all the extras."
4,good,good product I would like a better case is otherwise well I agree it took a while to get otherwise the product quality is very good movie I recommend
5,Excellent!,Really enjoyed it very much. My kids liked it. Very good quality video and sound. Thank you! Pretty good! Excellent and good deal.
3,"okay to watch the action, but storyline and plot pretty predictable","I appreciated the action and some of the come-back lines. Story and plot rather predictable. Getting rid of the ""bad aliens"" was at best, average and could have wowed me a bit more. I like who they picked as actors. I likely would have given this 3-1/2 stars if I could, but it is what it is."
5,Not review needed,I am sure by now most people have seen the avengers movie and I am late with this review but I order alot of amazon and do not get a chance to review everything in a timely manner. Anyways it is a great movie. If you for some reason have not seen it buy it today!
4,Superhero,"If you liked Hulk, Thor, Captain Amarica, and Iron Man you will like this movie. Fun movie kept me entertained."
1,"The movie is great, but Amazon Prime needs","Great movie. I wish the quality on Amazon prime was better. The movie had a number of times when it just stopped working and froze or froze up for a bit and went back to playing. This is not my Internet connection or anything like that. I use a Roku box with AT&T Uverse (the fastest plan available) and I never have problems with Netflix or Hulu. These problems are specific to Amazon Prime. I still keep Amazon Prime because it pays for itself with free shipping on my Amazon orders. It's also nice that Amazon prime has a lot of things available that you can't get on Netflix or Hulu. Of course, anything that is good requires an extra fee on top of what I already pay per month. Amazon Prime instant video is a perk if you are already going to get Prime for free 2-day shipping. But it is not a competitive substitute for Netflix or Hulu."
2,More Like Hulk 3?,"The effects are amazing, the actors are great, and it even stars two of my favorite super heroes (Iron Man,Captain America). Though there's one major flaw in the story besides it being poorly written. The Hulk is invincible..... I don't know much about Hulk in the comics, but this pretty much makes the Avengers pointless. In the movie it overly depicts Hulk as invincible, everyone is afraid of him, he gets shot with hundreds of lasers and nothing happens, at the end he utterly destroys the bad guy without help from any of the others. Seriously? Everyone else is just there to look cool while the Hulk dominates everything. Lame. This movie should be called Hulk 3. Glad we rent instead of bought....."
2,Shmaltz,"What have they done to comic book heroes? And everything in here is effects, effects, effects. And some of the effects are really dumb. Stupid flying fish skeletons? Really??? I don't think so! The only thing I liked is when the Hulk slugged Thor. Ain't that pathetic?!"
2,Uninspiring and boring super hero flick,"I'm a massive fan of the super-hero genre and Marvel flicks but I found The Avengers to be long, tedious, and uninspiring. There was very little of the human element that made the Batman and Spiderman films so entertaining. There was almost no plot and minimal character development. It was pure action over substance."
2,Good for 30 minutes...,... after that it's the same ol' thing over and over. It's all special effects with little else to offer
1,overrated,"So I've been a comics fan for a long time (with a hiatus of a few years while I was in junior high and high school). I've been reading through the history of the DC universe, reading the big stories and about my favorite characters. So naturally I wanted to start with this, as this is where it all supposedly started.This is easily the most boring graphic novel/trade I have read. How many times do we need to be told by reporters or newpapers that the world is in danger. There are some decent fight scenes, but they are few and far in between. As someone else said, read the synopsis on wikipedia or a DC-related site."
3,it's important....,"This book is an important book to the DC universe, sort of ties up all these multiple characters and loose ends. And as a story it isn't bad (though the art is a bit dull), but the cast was too big, and those that got the most page time were not the most interesting. I get why they did it, and it is necessary to read it (especially now with the Infinite Crisis that happened) but I didn't enjoy it that much."
2,"Important to DC, but boring as a novel","For anyone unaware, Crisis on Infinite Earths served to simplify and relaunch the 60-year-old DC Universe. It paved the way for some truly excellent work DC publishes now. Unfortunately, this book itself is quite boring. The plot consists essentially of a Deus Ex Machina (or two of them, to be precise) destroying, and then combining the multiple DC Universes into the single universe seen in DC Comics today.The plot and dialog are almost painfully boring at times. It's just about the most uninteresting way possible to do something that should actually be interesting, given its impact on the DC Universe over the last 15 years.Worth a purchase for curious fans of the current DC titles, but avoid this if you're new to comics, or don't care how the relaunch was pulled off."
1,confusing and lengthy,"This is the first time I have heard of Crisis on Infinite Earths. I thought I would give it a try. It was so long and wordy I gave up after the 5th chapter. I had a hard time finding it entertaining or follwoing the plot. It seemed all over the place to me with refernces and characters. I would say start with a shorter, less convoluted graphic novel."
1,Maybe this was decent 25 years ago...,"I purchased this as i have been getting back into comics and this is pretty much required reading for the DC universe. I had to force myself through it. It's a whole lot of text for what is at the core, a pretty simple plot. I get it's importance to the DCU, but it's not a great story... Maybe it could have been without all the worthless banter. How many times do you have to defeat the same villian in the same book? My suggestion is to read the synopsis on Wikipedia. I explained the plotline to my girlfriend and she said it sounded interesting. When thinking about what happens that is story related, it is interesting and a great idea, just cut out all the BS."
2,Umm...,"Maybe it's just that I'm a child of the Modern Age, but, how can I put this ...This book is just silly. The dialogue is bad, the story is drawn out much more than it needs to be and doesn't really tell us anything (besides lots of people are heroic), certain people are given godlike powers for no readily apparent reason ... ***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** and it doesn't even do a good job of cleaning up continuity. If everyone who fought the Anti-Monitor at the beginning of time remember the old earths, why doesn't the post-Byrne Clark Kent fondly remember his old friend Kal-L? Maybe the Linear Men fixed the timeline, I don't know, Marv sure didn't.Two stars for having lots of high-quality pages, all the cover art, and a nice new cover by Perez and Ross."
1,"Overrated, not work the time",I read this because it was a legendary tale. It was a big let down. The plot is very simple and stretched very thin. The significance of the story is big but how it plays out is long and slow. It does have a cool moment here and there but most of it is very hoaky and over the top.
1,An Infite Crisis of Lameness,"Without a doubt this is the biggest piece of crap I have ever read. I couldn't get past the 2nd or 3rd chapter. Long, overly involved, overly complex, and just plain old stupid. This is exactly the kind of thing that makes you embarassed to admit you love comic books, and this is exactly the reason DC tanked in the 80s and needed to be revived by Batman and Gaiman's Sandman in the late 80s. Read only if looking for simultaneous cures for insomnia and sanity. This was nothing more than a waste of my time and brain-space."
1,totally awful...,"this is one of those comics collections that history holds as so great, then you read it and think wha happened? because it sucks."
1,"Great artwork, NOT fun to read...","Another reviewer said that Crisis on Infinite Earths is fun to read. Not really, unless you're one of those people who enjoys watching Faces of Death videos. Crisis on Infinite Earths is a nearly 400-page string of countless deaths. My first reaction to it, in fact, was horror... it's much more of a horror story than a ""fun"" story.The book is also, as some have said, very confusing. It's definitely not for casual readers who have never heard of Crisis on Infinite Earths, or already read background information on it. For a better DC crossover, I would recommend Kingdom Come by Mark Waid and Alex Ross. For a more fun book, I would recommend Bizarro Comics."
3,wow,this is the most confusing comic ever. it tades place when the many eath of many dementions are being bestroyed one by one. all the DC hearoes are called to one place to fight the evel. what i like about it is that it is long and it keepsyou wnting to reed more.art it is one of the best drawn out art work i have ever seen. one it is bright and two it capture every deatale.i would say to buy this comic if you want to dea every super hearo and villin in one comic.[two peaple die]
3,Interesting but overated,"Maybe if I read this back in the 80's I would have been blown away by this story, this being the first of it's kind, but since I first read it in 2001 I wasn't very impressed. It is a very interesting look into DC history but suffers from bad dialogue, lame characters, lame customes, and bad hair-do's. Everyone says that Marv Wolfman is a great writer but I have yet to see him earn this reputation (did you read that ViroXX story he did in Superman, it's awful). Perez does some good art and I know those lame costumes aren't all his fault but I can't stand that poofy-hair he draws on so many characters. Somethings I learned from reading this, they were even lamer characters in the Pre-Crisis than in the Post-Crisis, the single universe created in Crisis is not the current DCU created in Man of Steel, and Alex Luthor II is the gayest character in comics and was proably hoping that Superboy would ""tunnel into that other place"" ""inside him"" (read the end you'll get it)."
1,NOT AS GOOD AS MANY THINK,"I just finished reading this book, and boy am I glad. If it wasn't for George Perez, I never would have bought it. I already know why DC did this book, to clean up their continuity. They also had to kill off a few major characters so it would be ""eventful."" The story is highly overrated, as are most stories now-a-days by ""acclaimed"" writers. But, I'm a sucker for George Perez art, so I did not really have a choice. Same goes for Byrne, Zeck, and Bright. No matter who writes the stuff they draw, I'll buy it. Too bad Bright and Zeck don't do more stuff and Byrne doesn't do more than one book. I have almost all their DC and Marvel stuff."
5,Perfection.,"This is hands down, one of the best, most beautifully drawn, most satisfying comics reading experiences ever produced. If you like superheroes, and DC heroes in particular, you need to own this. If nothing else, you'll come away from the series intrigued by DC's vast and colorful history, and the sheer inventiveness of the people who worked there, building the modern myhts that so many of us love. Highly recommended."
5,The most epic graphic novel of the 80s.,"In 1985, DC decided to streamline their continuity by destroying all but one of the many universes and dimensions in the multiverse. What happened was one of the most epic comic book novels of the 80s.....perhaps of all time.This novel quite literally spands the entire DC universe, and not JUST the superheroes. You'll also have the sci-fi comics (Like Kimandi) and the Westerns (Like Bat Lash). And the massive scale of the over all destruction is almost overwhelming at times.This story is quite thrilling......and complex. I'd compare it to the Lord of the Rings in its complexity. I've always suggested that their should be a companion volume to this particular book.I give this my highest reccomendation. Five stars all the way."
4,"""Crisis"" eased","I recieved the novel promptly with all professional documents. I bought it to read not to collect, ere go; the minor crease on the rear cover did not bother me. A decent comic book, very 80's plot, It was definitely revoluionary for it's time and age, not the best I've ever read but will be appreciated by anyone who wants to understand sequential art history."
2,Only worth it if you are a major DC Fan,"Crisis on Infinite Earths is frankly not worth the money unless you have a desperate desire to learn some of the backstory of current DC characters.The plot isnt particularly good, and is hampered by the desperate need to simplify the DC world (which failed in any case, as JLA:Earth 2 conveniently recycles ideas from the pre CoIE era).Even if you think you're up to date on current JLA and Golden Age timelines there will undoubtedly be a lot of backstory you do not understand.The DC universe changes so often that keeping up with it isnt worth it: it's a sucker's market. For a comic or this era that is readable I recommend 'The Return of Superman', which has its detractors but remains one of the few Superman books that doesnt bore me to death. Better still, check out Kingdom Come, Astro City, V for Vendetta or Sandman."
1,"Nice Idea, bad termination!","The book idea of ending the carrier of some DC Comics characters and heros is logical and acceptable in a way, giving the chance for future major changings.But the way that idea terminated was so poor, unfortunately.It needed a writer like Alan Moore or Cary bates to write it, and Curt Swan to pencil it.After 30 years of reading the Flash, Barry Allen deserves a better end than the one we read in this book, an ownered death, not a terrified ""silly"" dead after weakened by a silly Fear Master.Barry Allen deserved to die in the field.Also, the way Kara, Supergirl died, is so not logical.At least let some Kryptonite radiation appears before killing her, and at leat let the Superman Reaction be more emotional toward it.I dont know what to say, i am disappointed.God Bless Cary Bates, Alan Moore, Curt Swan, and others writers and penicellers, who made our imagination grows up."
2,Whirr. Clank. Thud.,"Given the commercial difficulties that necessitated the writing of this series of comics (i.e. the need to streamline the DC universe and cure writers of their growing obsession with complicated questions of continuity) it really would have been something if CRISIS had turned out to be even a moderately good story. It isn't, sadly - the whole thing reads like a giant engineering problem. Some nice cover art, though."
1,The book that ruined the DC Universe.,"You read it right, apart from having great Perez & Ordway art, this filth ruined a great history of DC characters written by many such as Gardner Fox, Robert Kanigher and trashed Julius Schwartz's concept of alternate Earths.This also paved other EVENTS book hopefully ending with a real... FINAL CRISES."
1,Are you serious?,What is the deal with listening to sound effects? You can't possibly tell me that a normal person enjoys listening to this pretentious garbage. If any of my friends were to play this in my presence I'd be gone.
4,Simply Brilliant,"Brilliant concept, brilliant title, brilliant work! The author dispels misconceptions about BDSM and encourages the reader to use his/her creative imaginations. Highly recommended for the cinical psychologist for his/her practice, members of the legal profession for understanding, or even members of sexual minorities looking for avenues of expression. A must read for anyone interested in BDSM or cultural anthropology/cultural expression. A realistic approach to this topic is what is needed most and this book delivers that much needed realistic approach. Bravo!"
5,Excellent introduction to SM!,"This book was one of the first instructional SM books I bought. I heartily disagree with the UK reviewer who said this book was a waste of money. On the contrary..it is full of excellent information about SM topics ranging from flogging, Dom/sub interactions, finding partners, to Humilation and erotic 'torture,' along with many other topics.Highly recommended if you want to learn more about consensual power exchange."
4,SM101,"Jay Wiseman does a great job of defining and creating a clear picture of BDSM and power exchange between Tops and bottoms. I think at times it was slow reading however it was one of the most informative books I have read on the subject thus far. I find it a must read to anyone beginning their journey or looking for clear realistic information into BDSM,"
5,good reference book,"Isn't really a sit down and read kinda book. Its a better reference guide because there are multiple chapters of just information, definition and instruction."
1,It is what it says SM 101,If you have had sex twice while tied up or having tied up someone else......you have already passed this class.
1,Do not bother to read this book!!!!!!!!!!,"If you are thinking of picking up this book, you likely have some ideas or thoughts about BDSM. Whatever you do, don't start here!As extremely avid readers, we found this book to be the worse written piece we have ever read. The quotes are entertaining, at times, and attempt to keep you awake between the excessive repetitiveness of the author's teachings.There is a bit of informative BDSM material, that is relevant only to the US, and is written from a single dominant male's perspective (reader beware). All of the ideas in this book could have been expressed in 1/4 of the pages.This book was largely a waste of our time especially with the internet at our fingertips. Shame on us for reading it!"
5,informative,Jay Weisman gets called to be an expert witness in trials that involve bdsm. I really enjoyed learning from his expertise. I have met him in person and hold him in high regard. He eventually signed my copy of this book.
5,A MUST FOR ALL WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE LIFESTYLE!!,"For any interested in the S&M lifestyle, this one is a MUST read for the safe, sane and consentual relationships that can be extremely fulfilling (or extremely disasterous when not handled safely.) Helpful hints for negotiation time, safewords...How to know when someone is ""playing a scene"" vs. being abusive, and much more to keep both the top and bottom safe and able to live with themselves (and/or each other) in the morning."
1,"For a 101 book, it is WAAAAAAY off.","1. Not all Dominants and/or tops are male2. Not all submissives and/or bottoms are female3. If you title your book 101 you need to cover all the 101 basics and make it clear to the reader that there is a LOT more to BDSM than just tying up your bottom/sub to have sex with ""her""4. It took me three tries to get through reading this book because I found his view point to be so utterly frustrating, close-minded and male-dom centric.5. Because of books titled like this that people read for the first time with good intentions not knowing any better many of us in the community spend YEARS trying to undo the damage, or just avoiding schmucks that books like this have given the wrong impression to.6. Let me repeat point #2 in a different way as many new male doms reading this book seem to be confused. NOT ALL WOMEN ARE SUBMISSIVE OR YOUR BOTTOM. Do NOT try to top us because you think it is our gender role."
5,I always wanted to try that!,"Three weeks ago, my image of S/M was a dominatrix in thigh-high leather boots, cracking a whip at a groveling computer engineer. While that image has strong roots in reality, SM101 has broadened that vision to include things I never imagined. More importantly, this excellent book has defined a context in which many things I have imagined make more sense.While the information is well-researched and exhaustively tested by the author, what makes this book so useful is its readability. Any book can list a variety of erotic torture implements, but only Jay Wiseman can provoke the readers's imagination with his loving details and wistful anecdotes.For a novice, this book provides a priceless introduction to an intimidating topic. For a jaded pro, this book is a definative reference which keeps the basics of this pleasure-sport alive."
5,Great place to start,"This book is great, it was the first book I read on BDSM and I couldn't put it down. It revealed a world I'm curious in very well. It was easy to understand and fun to read. Jay gives you new leads to head to after reading the book. I felt a good understanding after reading it and my friend was amazed on well I could use terms after reading. This is book you should have if just learning and even as reference. I know I'll be consulting this book for notes as well as leads and contact info."
2,Well Intentioned But Too Pedantic,"The book was written with the best intentions. However, Wiseman details in precise, numbered lists many of the basic techniques to the point of boredom. He includes how many strokes to apply and exactly where. It leaves the reader with a sense that the techniques provided within must adhere to a strict set of rules.If you feel most comfortable with tight guidelines, then this is a fine book. I would suggest taking a look at titles like ""Screw the Roses"" or ""Sensual Magic"" to gain more creative insights into the realms of BDSM."
2,OK for those with a little experience...,"This book was an ok read. It is probably better for someone with a little bit of experience but if you have done more than just dabbled in BDSM, then this book is not for you. Not really for submissives either... This book is better for someone who is interested in being a dominant."
5,A Great Source for both novices and the curious,My wife and I enjoyed reading this book that is both insightful and educational. We would recommend this to anyone who is curious about bondage and s&m as well as those who are looking to give it a try.
5,I loved this book!,As a semi new person to the BDSM Lifestyle I found this to be a Great starter book. It showed me ALOT of things that I was doing wrong....that could have ended badly. Also tought me a few things I had not heard of yet. I recommend this book to anyone intrested in this Lifestyle we choose to live.
2,reads like a text book only more dry,"Wisman provides a wealth of info on BDSM which is great for new people and the books greatest asset. The information provided is dead on, but you have to be somewhat of a masochist to read it all the way through. I think that you can get the same great information that Wiseman provides from ""Screw The Roses, Send Me The Thorns"" by Molly Devon and the late Phillip Miller and ""Come Hither"" by Gloria Brame in a much more enjoyable form. Both of those books still provide the information needed, but do so with humor and personal stories that makes you want to keep reading."
1,I wasted my money and time,"This was just a total waste of time in the recording studio. A bunch of politically charged lyrics that had no basis in reality. I was sorry that there was nothing lower on the volume control than mute. A total waste of money to purchase and a waste of time to listen to it. I kept hoping it would get better, but each song was worse than the previous one."
4,"good, but gads is it grim...","Well, this was sort of unexpected. Ferman's Devils was a very fun, light read, despite the ever-present darker elements. This second tome more or less cuts out the ""fun, light"" bit, in favour of expanding on said darker elements. You may have noticed that, despite the gang's alleged brutality, you never actually see them kill anyone. Here, you see them make a whole lot of people die. In addition to that, the company comes across as much more evil, and Boddekker's ladylove is much more cold, cynical, and generally repulsive. It's still a good read, but it's certainly a shock."
3,A glorified dictonary,"This book has a place in your library you if you need a quick reference for terms, definitions, and genera that writers use."
5,Great book,Actually a pretty good layout for teaching writing. It is clear and pretty open and yet gives good information. I have enjoyed working through this book.
1,Not enough development of the ideas,"The ""shapes"" are not developped enough to be useful in creating a salable story. These are merely toy exercizes good for a college class in which no one expects to write for a living, oir write at all for that matter."
5,A thesis for dropping out of life with bong in hand,"""You can communicate with crickets if your outside. You just have to tap on a hard surface, rhythmically.""Sleep's Dopesmoker is an incredible album. It's an album that is as much of an attempt at an epic fantasy novel, as it is an endorsement of an altered state, as represented by Emu stomach drones and metal-soul tones. Sabbath drip, but no note-for-note trip.I smoked dope a few minutes ago.The downstrokes/downbeats in this song/album make you know they have researched the feeling.This is the only song that really matters.Even if you belong to the non-imbibing freeloader sect. You will understand why we have to be martyrs of the leaf. You will hear this song and realize why we, the foggy children of Nazareth, have to set these deep frequencies. We have other options but this option is the only one that is ""badass"".___O____O____O___O____"
1,disappointing,"With Mart Pike's post-High on Fire project ""Sleep"", the conclude has reached a point of sustainable self-interest. For a genre, you could choose "" DRONE "", "" DOOM "" or "" CANTOPOP "", in an unavoidable situation we will generalized: "" STOKER ROCK "". It is at once a thing that will rememberance your salutation with -> BLACK SABBATH or CATHEDRAL or GREEN DAY. But in these good intentions, we will find many mistakes. This is an underestimated coincidence, and if we are agree with such circumstances, we will disappoint... it is unavoidable."
5,Classic stoner metal masterpiece,Some of the heaviest riffage of all time. Its not for everyone but if you have an hour or so to zone out Dopesmoker can't be beat.The live version of Holy Mountain tacked on to this release is great as well.
5,FIRE IT UP SASQUATCH !,"THAT'S THE SQUATCH ON VOCAL THAT GUY IS RIGHT ! Olga used to play cards with him on Friday nights, but every time he went up in the woods to crap someone showd up with a camera and he finally just quit coming around: any way ~ I like this ! so many of these attempts are boring ... not this one the drummer gets into some really cool timing here adding, leaving off quarter measures half measures what ever suits his or her fancy at the time. The freestyle feel is great. The singer is right on get the room hazy and slip away man. Leads are killer freaky. Doom trodden yet bright green and uplifting...I feel so warm and fuzzy about my choice to buy this record it's lt makes me sorta well... you know ATMOSPHERICALLY CONCUPISCENT... there I said it."
4,"Just what we needed, a longer Jerusalem!","Having just heard the 52-minute Jerusalem version on XM Radio, my first thoughts were, ""If only there was a longer version to give me a chance to really get into it."" And as if my prayers were answered, a 63-minute version.But what I was really hoping for was like a 24-hour version with even less variety... just kidding... give me Master of Puppets any day!"
5,Shortchanged,"This book is a well-organized, comprehensive treatment of America's ""shadow economy"". The author provides facts and figures, along with his well-researched topics, which range from payday loans to predatory mortgages."
5,Awesome!,"Great CD. Not really for casual fans, but grab it if you are collector. Sound quality is high."
1,Terrible recording,"Franco Corelli has a spectacular voice, however this CD skips & jumps all over the place, I will send it back if I can."
4,Answer key necessary.,"Would be even better if there was an answer key. Love the Biblical verses at the end of each chapter in context, though!"
5,Important Information - Highly recommend!,"I read this during my second pregnancy so I could prepare myself better for my planned c-section. I had a surprise c-section with my first child. So I really wanted to prepare mentally for my next one. I learned so much from this book and related to everything in it for the post-recovery chapters. I really think every pregnant woman should read this, especially if it's your first pregnancy. You will learn so much and gain insight of what to expect and how to recover well. I had hard recoveries, so I am glad that I could learn more about my body and how to deal with emotions post-birth. I love this book. I appreciate the authors for writing this book."
2,Some good content,"This is a useful book to read for general knowledge but borrow it from the library first if you can. Most of things are common sense.I bought it because of the workout chapter. However, it has been a disappointment for me as there are not a lot of exercises there and once you progress you find that you can no longer use this book..."
1,not even worth reading,Don't buy this book unless you have nothing else to do. There is no insight that you can't easily find on the internet or get from your doctor. Im my opinion this book is written by people who like to hear them selves talk and talk and talk. A great deal of the questions most of us have are also up to the hospital that you will be having you c-section at so this book can only tell you what it has experience with and that's not much.
5,Essential is right!,"Three years ago, I underwent an emergency c-section and have had emotional issues surrounding it since. Now that I've learned with this second pregnancy that I am not a candidate for an attempted vaginal birth, I decided it was high time to educate myself as much as possible.After reading this book, not only am I feeling more prepared for the upcoming c-section but I'm also more understanding of the one I had years ago. I heartily recommend this for every woman, whether she's pregnant and planning on a vaginal birth or a mom that has had a c-section in the past."
3,"Good book, but not completely unbiased","This book had many helpful tips for being prepared for my c-section and claimed to be unbiased on the subject of elective c-sections. However the more that I read, the more that I got heated because the author repeatedly kept saying ""in efforts to avoid labor pain"" when referring to an elective c-section. Avoiding labor pain had nothing to do with my decision to have a c-section so I felt a little insulted by this book at times. That being said, I do think I took away many good tips to help with a speedier recovery time."
3,Mary Ware Dennett,"It is unfortunate that there are so few books that even give Dennett the time of day. Most just mention her as an aside and Chen gets it right in the beginning of the book when she lists the endless afronts done to Dennett in current historical works on the Birth Control Movement. They do get her name wrong, her accomplishments get confused with others' and Sanger gets all the attention because she demanded it. The only downside here is that this is one of the only current books that is exclusively about Dennett and it is highly opionated. Chen lets out seemingly angry and defensive comments toward Dennett's rivals and regularly is hypocritical in her defense of Dennett. I understand why, but it does make it difficult to use in my research."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ANY HUMAN!,"This is hands-down the BEST book on learning how to listen and speak compassionately in a nonviolent manner...it is about removing the personal slant in interpreting another human's needs which can automatically puts someone on the defense depending on how it is presented. It is about learning to listen AND respond in a loving manner. After reading this I can respond to each person's need without the personal filter viewing another's need as a threat to my own, I can listen in an empathetic manner and then determine my ability to answer the request. This is wonderful for teaching children and my kids receptivity to this technique is above measure. *********************"
5,Tools for managing conflict.,"This book has some clear cut steps to take to manage or prevent conflict and misunderstanding. The book centers around four simple skills that can put you in touch with a different way of thinking and speaking ,that people around the world are saying helps them enormously. The chapter on managing anger is especially powerful. One particular story in the book gives insight to the power that this communication model can give. A prisoner with whom Rosenberg was working, to help the prisoner understand how not getting his needs met had led him to violence, said after a day long workshop, 'Marshall, if I had known all this two years ago I wouldn't have had to kill my friend!!' Whew!!!"
2,Mundane and academic - too thin,A few good ideas stretched over way too many pages. No one will argue with the quality of the thought -- it's just that there isn't enough here to fill a book. Save your money.
2,DONT BOTHER WITH THIS,I HAVE FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE A REPETITIOUS WASTE OF TIME.THE ONLY USE OF THIS INFORMATION WOULD BE FOR SOMEONE TRAINING TO NEGOTIATE WITH PROBLEM GROUPS OR WORKING AS SHRINK. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. .
3,Inventive,"Robert Simpson was one of the greatest composers of the twentieth century. This is moving, inventive music. It is hard to conceive of anyone listening to it and not being moved. The third symphony is probably my favorite by Simpson. It has a certain charm that the others lack. I recommend this CD. Listen to it at twilight on an autumn evening ... and you'll know why."
5,Absolutely fabulous,"This is a wonderful compliation of stories, music, and poety from the aural history of New Mexico. I was raised in Alameda, NM and this book brings to mind many fond memories. If you want to ""hear"" New Mexico get this book and the CD set ""A portrait in Sound of Hispanic New Mexico."""
5,Early music with instant appeal.,"The tuneful simplicity of the works on this disc, the first in an outstanding series by Page and his excellent ensemble, is bracing and refreshing. The program is well-balanced for listening to all the way through, with solo and duet pieces nicely mixed in with full ensemble selections. Anyone who is in doubt about the diversity of mood and sound of early music should hear the imagination, personality, and skill Page and the Gothic Voices bring to every track on this disc.Check out the following discs in the same series, or any of the Hyperion recordings by the Gothic Voices."
5,Sacramento Salutes Dylan,"This CD was drawn from 2 Dylan tribute shows performed by Sacramento area musicians. Included are Sal Valentino, frontman of The Beau Brummels in the '60s and Stoneground in the '70s, with his first recordings in 25 years. Also featured is newcomer Jackie Greene & his band, who also serve as house band behind several of the performers. All the tracks are great, ranging from solo acoustic to scorching blues, the latter exemplified by my favorite track, Lonesome Day Blues by Mick Martin backed by the Greene band. The old adage says a live recording is great if it makes you wish you were there... this CD surely qualifies!"
2,Disappointing and misleading,"John Nunn is a wonderful chess writer. His 'Understanding Chess Move by Move' is possibly the most instructive chess book ever written. And his two previous books on his own games are excellent.However this book is a disappointment. For a start it is less than honest as it does not, though the title suggests otherwise, apply 'move by move' analysis to the games. The misleading title is an attempt to cash in on the success of his previous book using that approach. Also, unlike his other game collection books, this book has a tired feel to it and Nunn, on the evidence of this book, seems disenchanted with chess. The book also has quite an amount of 'filler' - studies, compositions, articles on chess publishing (hardly of much interest except to chess authors).In summary this book is misleading in its title and disappointing in its content. Instead read John Nunn's other excellent books."
2,Would-be 2.5...this is an incredibly average album.,"First, judging by the photograph on the liner and the cd itself, one might guess this to be some kind of guttural gothic death metal. From the first track one would be grateful (or perhaps disappointed) that it's instead quite harmless and almost upbeat, however once the lyrics end, they go into some kind of dissonant jam that is just plain noisy. The accoustic numbers seem odd following them. Clumsy or forced rhymes, words that seem out of place (i.e. sublime, genufleck?), and sometimes whiny vocals also weigh down the album. This is not to say it's a bad album; it's usually a decent, even pleasant listen. Ultimately, this album's respectable failure is caused by a lack of a target audience. It pushes an empty punk envelope, then pauses for sentimental reflection, often forgetting to tone down the screeching guitars. If they were more than average singers, lyricists, or musicians, we might just have heard of them."
4,Gayton is Expansively Compassionate,"Shrewd and expansively compassionate observations play a steady drumbeat throughout this author's prose and poems, echoing a myriad of cultures, cities, and souls as Gayton pursues a relentless global search for personal integrity, both his and those of his subjects."
4,"Nice, but expensive","I found this book to have a lot of solid, useful information, which was presented in a succinct, economical way. It covers the basics well. However, the book itself is quite pricey. I've actually been torn between keeping it (because it is an excellent book) and returning it (because it was so expensive). It's a pretty slim book, and I'm impressed that the author was able to cram two entire semesters of conservatory-level theory -- plus some exercises -- into such a thin book, but, by the same token......it's hard for me to justify paying so much for such a small volume!So, I'm still on the fence about this. There are more expensive theory books out there, for sure, and the majority of them are no doubt a lot wordier. I do like the book. Just can't decide whether I can afford it or not!"
1,lysol cleaner,The clorox bleach in this product is overcoming.....and the smell lasts for many hours afterwards. Should not be used without ventilation.
4,Perfect for the Weekend,"I bought these to install on my 02 Chevy Avalanche. I installed them on my push bumper. I have little to no mechanical ability and the install on these was pretty straight forward. For once, the instruction manual actually was decent. I installed these in about 1 hr. Somebody with experience could probably do them with half. They are bright enough for what I need them for and have stood up to intermediate use for about 3 months now."
5,Exceeded Expectations!,"These KC’s light up dark & lonely places with brilliant, far reaching, white light even better than I had imagined they would. Install was easy on my ’11 JK using Smittybilt 7690 brackets. The switch works great & adjustment of the beams was easy & positive with a 14mm wrench for the horizontal & a 13mm socket & extension for the vertical. Antenna interference with the passenger side light was avoided by angling the antenna back behind the light. Nice product!"
5,great product,Install was easy. All part and wiring harness were easy to install and the right length. Small problem was the size of the ground connectors. The loops were a bit small for the ground screws on my jeep.all in all a good buy.
5,Great lights awesome part!,"These lights rock! The Slimlite series is just thin enough to look really great while producing lots of light! They dont move with the anti move system built in. Even while off roading they will stay put, unless hit another car :). The wires are all there and plenty long. This was my first electrical job and it went very smooth. Easy to mount and look great! Just make sure you know where you want the switch :) I put mine to low."
5,*******GREAT SET OF LIGHTS******,If you own a JEEP Wrangler JK or any Wrangler for a matter of fact. We all know that lighting the trail is very important!! these lights are really bright no they are not as bright as a HID would be but you cant beat the price!!!!! The install was VERY VERY EASY I have a 2010 Jeep wrangler JK 2 door and it took me about 45 min-1 hr to get everything ran and installed. I am not a expert at Electronics and this was the easiest thing I have installed yet. all in all it is a great product and a great company I love KC cant wait to get some KC fog lights or maybe some driving lights on the front bumper!!Trust me buy this product you will not be dissapointed!!!!!Its a jeep thing you wouldent understand :)
3,camera case works better,Purchased this item but I don't use it. The holes sloted for the buttons are not very fited. It works great just to hang around your neck if you plan on pulling it out to play if you were killing time somewhere.I bought the Wenger brand camera case that works jsut fine. The case fits as if it was made for it.
2,"Jeez,can we get anymore bland and predictable?","Seriously,I enjoy all types of music,so it's not a genre thing. It's just a matter of how many ""college rock"" bands can a person take? I saw them in Wilmington and it just bored me to death. I hate to be so blunt,but whenever I go to Wilmington(I'm in Jacksonville,NC) everyone talks my ear off about this band. The cd was given to me,and the best thing about it is the production.This is like MTV stuff,and that's not a compliment. I also heard they had some songs on Dawson's Creek. Hello! That is not cool.If they can just get out of the box,and kill that college rock typical sound,they may have less songs on tv,but a little more respect."
2,"If you've never used Outlook, you can start with this book.","This book doesn't have enough information for advanced users. If you are familiar with Outlook97, this book will not enhance your knowledge. I wanted a book explaining the ""Net Folder"", which is a new feature in Outlook. However, this topic isn't mentioned in this book. I believe the title ""Mastering Microsoft Outlook 98"" is overstated. The title should be, ""Microsoft Outlook 98 for Beginners""."
3,Not very much,"This book helps us to study English at our University. We learn how the justce is administered in USA from ""The Challenge of Democracy."" It`s a little bit boring, but on the other way it is very nice source of legal terms"
1,To be avoided...,Despite much anticipation this DVD performance is definitely sub-standard. Stefan Vinke as Paul is so bad it is truly pathetic. He yells through most of the performance and does not even come close to an acceptable performance. Solveig Kringelborn just does not have the voice or lyricism to sing Marie. The rest of the singers are hindered by similar problems. Eliahu Inbal gives us his usual indifferent interpretation. The production is just dark and boring with only moments of interest. I particularly like the camera shots where we are looking into the off-stage wings... So unprofessional! If you love this opera as I do keep your old DVD and wait for the new one that will be out next year. BUYER BEWARE!!!
4,Tea Time... or Coffee,"This has been great around the office for tea, and on occasion coffee (not to say it's not good for coffee too, I just don't drink it often). It has a good look and feel to it.My only gripe is that the glaze on the top part of the handle connecting to the cup isn't sealed perfectly. Not really a big deal.I'm happy with my purchase."
4,Kewl door stop ~ but ...,"I've had these magnetic door stops before, and they are really neat for a door that has a mind of its own and wants to close all the time.This one is good. Strong magnet, and a decent price. Easy enough to install.Packaging was rather shoddy. They just stuck it in a bubble wrap envelope which tore in the mail. No damage to the product fortunately."
4,as advertised,"worked to resolve a door that wouldn't stay open, can mount on wall or floor....instructions not the clearest, but pretty simple"
3,Does what it is supposed to do,"I bought this product for $6.98, so I didn't expect it to be of tremendously high quality. And it isn't. Still, it does what it is supposed to do. The magnet works very well. It's not too strong, so when you need to shut the door, it's not necessary to pull very hard. At the same time, it certainly keeps the door open (although, I use it on an inside room, so there are no strong gusts of wind to blow it shut).It was fairly easy to install, but I discovered that the screws the company includes with the unit are very cheap--the heads of the screws got stripped pretty easily and I had a little bit of difficulty screwing them all the way in. You need to be careful.Overall, I'm satisfied, but if you use this unit in a conspicuous place where looks matter, you may want to got with a more expensive option."
2,Magnetic Door Stop,"The device works, but the brass finish was poorly done with light spots showing through."
5,THE book for anyone dealing with customers,"One of the best business books I've ever read. Danny really ""gets it"" as far as treating his employees and customers like family and VERY important people. THIS is why he is so successful with the top restaurants in NYC. A MUST read for anyone in sales or who deals with customers and employees on a daily basis"
3,Jim Cramer's opinion is....well....Jim Cramer,"On the cover of the book you will see this quote, ""This is the most important business book of our time"" - Jim Cramer. I have to disagree. It is an interesting biography of Danny Meyer at best, with a few gold nuggets thrown in from his life experience. I happened to buy the book for a friend who owns a restaurant. If you own a restaurant or want to buy it for someone who does or wants to, then fine, it's a really good resource. Otherwise, there are thousands of other better ""business"" books out there. Good hunting!"
3,It's okay,If you want to know about Danny Meyer's life (which is quite interesting) then this book is for you. If you are looking for a book that gives you a lot of easy to apply ideas to apply to your restaurant or business then you will be disappointed. He does share his values and gives quite a few interesting examples of how to apply hospitality and the importance of it. It's okay
3,For what it's worth.,"As someone who is slowly pursuing my dream of my own restaurant, I found this book less usefull than to-the-point how to open a reastaurant books. That said, from a manager's standpoint, especially when considering employees and situations an owner is likely to find themselves in, it is useull advice. Danny's outlook on entrepenurial objectives is useful not only to the hospitality industry, but to anyone who serves the public, or owns a business. Totally worth having, for what it's worth."
2,business,"in this book, there was too much name dropping. i found it kinda hardto stay interested because of that. most readers don't know these peopleso i'm not sure why the writer found it important to do this. therewere some great messages in there about service and hospitality. i didn'teven feel like passing this book on to other freinds in the business."
1,Setting the Table: The Transforming Power of Hospitality in Businessw,I have no clue how this book is yet. It is one the wish list of someone that is on my Christmas List.
5,Restaurant Ops 101,Wonderful story of what it takes day in and day out to become successful in this industry. Thank you for sharing your story.
5,"A ""Must Read"" for all involved in customer care","Although this book reads a bit slow in chapters 1-3 - the author really gets cooking in chapter 4 when he begins to provide his story of ""turning over the rocks"" to learn more about customer experiences, their patterns, and all of the elements that may go into their decision to or not to choose your brand/company etc.Chapters five through 12 just sing, and would make anyone passionate about making customer service better, and engaging the right people for the right type of work within an experience-driven work role, very pleased to have read.(This is my first review - please forgive the rudimentary nature of my opinion on this book - I think you'll find the book a little hard to put down.)"
5,Very Well Done,I really enjoyed this. It confirmed many things that I have been doing already in the art business. Treating customers like people with whom you can have a lasting relationship. This and other important management skills are addressed.
5,Setting the Table should be called Setting the Standard,One of the very best service industry books I have ever read. Danny Meyer has truly grasped the deatils on Enlightened Hospiatlity.
5,What an incredible person with an incredible gift.,"I had the great pleasure of working for Danny Meyer briefly in 2002 as a hostess at the acclaimed Tabla, and he is just an exceptional individual. You can tell that first and foremost he cares about his customers and the well-being of his staff. I feel completely honored and blessed to have worked for such a visionary and I am glad to see that he has written a book to let us all in on his great secret of success."
4,Good quality tie,"Very nice quality, both in the feel of the silk and the vividness/clarity of the image."
2,All I Desire,"Expertly filmed and staged, but with little substance. Central theme, of a woman who abandons her family for ten years (for no good reason as far as I can see)and returns to be accepted into the family again, is unconvincing. Looks like an excuse for the star (Barbara Stanwick)to go through her dramatic routine. Douglas Sirk has done much better (The Tarnished Angels, Written on the Wind, Imitation of Life, etc)"
1,Most unhelpful,"This book is terrible. It has yet to help me in any way, and I've had it for years. Most of the time, I can't find an entry even close to the word for which I'm looking. The entries that are there make no sense. For example, ""Single"" just shows a lot of one of an item -- one button, one pencil, one binder clip, one dog, a girl. I'm pretty sure when someone looks up ""single"" they aren't looking for just a bunch of singular items. This book feels like someone just wanted to design a pretty book with some quirky illustrations that make no sense or have no relevance to the topic. Not worth purchasing. I'd give you my copy for free just to be rid of it and clear some space on my bookshelf."
5,Great stuff for foosball tables,"If you demand an ultrasmooth, ultrasensitive experience with delicate ball handling, this is a great lube. Now get your mind out of the gutter, I'm talking about foosball."
5,Great Product,"This lubricant was just what I needed for my Vinyl windows to slide easily, and most importantly it has been about 2 weeks since I applied it and the windows still open smoothly. No gunk build up and not greasy, just works. great product and I would recommend to anyone."
3,Odorless and slippery,"The 3M Silicone Lubricant Plus (Wet Type) worked great on my car interior. Especially in the cold weather, some parts of the dashboard were rubbing and making irritating noises. After spraying the problem area with this lubricant, the rubbing noise was eliminated. It was especially nice that there was no odor. My only frustration is that it did not come with a little straw (like WD-40 often does) to aim the product more accurately. I tried a coffee stirrer, but the diameter was just a little too big for the nozzle. Application would have been easier and less messy with a straw-style applicator."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It's jazzy in a very peaceful sort of way. I listen to it with my kids in the car. It always calms me down when I am tense. I tell my masseuse to play it for me when I get my massages. The audio quality is excellent.
3,"Adequate, but more work than expected","Bought these mats as they were supposed to fit a Toyota Rav4. Unfortunately, Toyota stopped making the all-weather mats, so I was stuck with these. Making them reasonably fit required all kinds of trimming, including trimming the raised edge in places. They are for all intents and purposes universal mats that will give your utility knife a good workout. I would not buy them again."
2,Not the right fit,"I was expecting a mat that covered the entire floor area of the drivers side. This mat left a lot of floor space exposed each side even though I filled in all the correct information reguarding make, model etc of my car."
5,"Good fit, good construction",These are great. We got them for our new 12 Pilot and they fit well and don't slip around at all. It's pretty amazing how much dirt and grime they collect (glad that stuff isn't infused into the carpets on the vehicle).
5,great product buy again!,Received as promised Great fit good color . Change name of store Best Buy #1
5,A singularly brilliant album,"This album just totally rules. If you love extreme metal, you will love this. Other reviewers aren't all that far off when they describe it as blackened industrial technical death metal. This is my fave album for 2004!"
3,Ok for the price,All you see is plastic and it looks a bit cheap. But overall this is a fine object for the price but don't expect a great piece of art.
4,Worthwhile help,"This book is a great help for those taking beginning level Attic Greek with the Groton textbook. Since the authors for the two books are different, there are some minor problems. I've also found two errors in the book so far. Basically a great help, but imperfect."
2,Quality over Quantity,"NOT cover bands as suggested above. A truly excellent collection. Each and every title a must-have hit. These songs will create a trip back in time for many. Now, the downside. . . the quality of the CDs is lacking in many respects. You can certainly tell they were mass produced. Many songs sound like they were recorded through a tin can. Many stereo attributes do not come through on the discs. There are times when the music drowns out the vocalist as one track is recorded to the discs louder than the other.Time-Life has made a mess of what could have been a wonderful collection. The price of [...] bucks is way too high for the quality of the product. You would do better by waiting for this collection to end up in the cut outs or anything that would bring the price down to about $[...] or $[...] but no more.For shame Time-Life - You blew it!"
3,"Good, but some chopped songs","This is a good collection from the 70's, but I was really annoyed to find that some of the songs were the chopped down AM radio version, and not the full-length album cut of the song. Not a large percentage of songs chopped, but enough to be really annoying (especially when it's a song I liked). My guess was 20 of the 160 songs were chopped down."
2,One great track; new versions by the original artists,"These tracks are new versions by the original artists. That's why they don't sound like the original recordings -- they aren't the original recordings. Whoever assembled the album got the original artists to re-record their old hits, or maybe the re-recordings were lying around for some reason. The album listing should make clear that these aren't the original recordings, and it doesn't.I can't comment on most of the tracks because I've heard only the clips Amazon provides. I can comment on one, which I bought: ""On and On,"" by Stephen Bishop. I recommend it highly. It's a great performance, mostly solo acoustic and voice, with double-tracked vocals in a couple of spots. The original version,here, is one of the best pop records of the '70s. This version is different but also excellent, and very much worth owning."
1,cover bands?? again??!!,"Where can I find the originals for some of these tracks?I'm tired of download services offering cover versions of songs with an artist's name next to the track. Let's get honest, Amazon. Yes it's ""Band of Gold,"" but is that Freda Payne??? Yes, it's ""One Toke Over the Line,"" but is that really Brewer & Shipley??? That is NOT the Ozark Mt. Daredevils, The Foundations or Badfinger."
2,DIDNT LIKE THIS BOOK AT ALL,"I will say that i love good books and was looking forward to reading this, but when i got the chance it didnt catch me like the title did.THE REASON WHY I SAY THis BECAUSE is was a typical book.nothing to guess after about the 100th page i knew where it was going white man black women,white women black man its was nothing different from many OTHER books i already read.But am glad that most of the reviews were good.I love to read and always post my reviews ,and hate to have to write when a book i read wasnt good but am sorry dwanye i fought with myself to finish this novel.but gOOD luck on this book anyway i just didnt like it."
5,Outstanding,"To start off this book just kicks A$$. It is an easy to read and fast paced book. Just a few pages into it, you can really get to know & understand the characters. It is so well written and in such a manner that you get wrapped up in the characters. It has several key elements: Love, DRAMA, Humor, growth of characters. So if you want a book that will keep you interested until the end (which has a great ending), then definitely purchase this book by an up and coming author....... You GO Dwayne!!!"
3,Not what I expected - but in a good way,"I'm really not sure why the book is titled Choices Men Make, because we really only get insight into Vic's choices, but no so much Colin's and Roy's. But this book was good nonetheless. It was an interesting and orginal story that I can honestly say I've never read or seen before. I have to agree with another reviewer though who mentioned that the women in the book (expecially Stacey) turned nasty out of nowhere. It would have been better if the author had developed Roy and Stacey's marriage a bit more so we could better understand where she was coming from(instead of the quick explanation toward the end). So the book could've been longer and more in depth, but it was definitely an enjoyable, quick read."
3,It was alright...,If you need a quick and easy read...this book will do...Involves inter-racial relationships. Typical relationship drama and happy ending. Good for bookclub discussions.The author goes into detail in regards to the characters past relationship decisions. This painted a better picture of why the relationships went the way they did.
3,Not Bad!!!,"Having never heard of Dwayne S. Joseph, I purchased this book after seeing the on-line rating being an average of 4 stars. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this book as much as some of the other readers. Although the book was fast-paced and easy to read, I feel the author could have included more than he did. I would also liked to have seen more interaction between Roy and his wife. Also, I would not have picked that name for the title. (But now I'm just being picky!!!) Overall it was o.k. If you're just looking for a quick read to kill some time, this may be for you. Honestly I preferred Electa Rome Parks "" Ties that Bind"". However, I don't give up on this author. He has alot of potential!"
4,"Not hot, but warm.","I enjoy this little guy. It isn't super hot, but does make the cold leave very quickly. Will make the room around 60-70 degrees in about half an hour to an hour. Cold touch front, which I like. Energy saver does feel much cooler, but it cycles so it will warm back up. Not exactly a ""Turn on and instantly get warm"" type of heater. The air does come out warm from the very start, but for best use leave it on in the room for a while. Keeps you warm during the night splendidly. Won't make the room hot, but does make it cozy. Only two settings, Eco-friendly and Non-Eco-friendly, but does have an automatic shutoff set for four hours. I like it."
2,no warm enough ....,"We chose this model because it seemed an energy-efficient alternative to our previous Holmes spaceheater, which had worn out after several years of use. The one really good aspect of this heater is that it seems very safe -- the moment it is tilted or put against a surface, it stops. However, it does not generate a lot of heat, even on the higher setting. We have a very small bathroom, yet even after running the heater for 30+ minutes, the room is still not what I would consider really warm (admittedly, I'm a person who is easily chilled.) We bought this in November and used it daily, but I was never completely happy with it, and now the heating element is starting to give out and the heater is generating even less warmth. We're definitely shopping around for something with a little more heating power."
1,"Cold and breezy, tripped the circuit","I used this for the first time today because my heater is broken. Well, it pushes air around the room acting like a fan. This made it feel more chilly in here. It did seem to raise the room temperature slightly even though it was breezy. However, after a couple hours the electricity went out and we had to go fix the circuit breaker. The plug was very hot so this will be going in the garbage."
4,Great for toddlers,"We have 2 of these as we have to have space heaters in our house but have 2 young babies (1 1/2 and 6 months) at our house. They are not hot to the touch and warm (albeit slower than other heaters) our dining and living room during the fall. They aren't super powerful, so if you live in vermont look elsewhere, but for coolish 40-50 weather, they do the trick."
2,Holmes Energy Saver,"This unit heats quite nicely, but the on/off switch only works intermittently. When the switch won't work, and you use the plug to turn it off, it makes the house lights dim. I will probably buy a different heater."
3,"It functions, but.....","I didn't especially care for this product; I found myself still quite cold even after it was on for awhile. Instead of returning it, I gave it away and ordered another type of space heater instead:DeLonghi EW7707CM Oil-filled Radiator with ComforTemp TechnologyI prefer this model; once I did as the insructions suggested and put the unit right near a very cold window, it made my space quite cozy.I haven't gotten an electric bill yet this month, but as the heat in my condo is gas, I'm sure I'll see some savings."
2,used item,"I got this product , first was shocked because it was used(labeled as new) , wiped and sold.Even the wire has white dirt and chips.I was about to return it back , but as I paid for shipping ,I am gonna loose it twice,so i kept it and use it.It runs ok, no problem at all, just it is not as described regarding new and used, that is why i give additional star for working good."
4,okay pillow,"This pillow looks good. It's covered in the same fabric as the comforter (but solid red on the back). It is very soft and squishy. I would rather it be stuffed more firmly, but it will be fine."
5,Awesome poems! Highly recomend!,"A collection of quiet beauty. Simple, elegant poems. Worth many re-readings. One of the books I'd recommend for people that don't like poetry. The problem with most poetry collections is that they're too long. Moser doesn't fall into that trap. His poems are short, well-constructed, incisive, and beautiful, the images placed like pearls on a necklace.Most Ancient of All Splendors"
4,A collection of poems with a unique approach.,"One feels transported from epoch to epoch, culture to culture as she reads these lovely poems which vary greatly in style and point of view."
5,great gift for daddy!,"I got this pen for my dad when I was a kid. I noticed that regular pens couldn't write sideways for long, so when I saw this at a science museum, I thought it'd be great for my dad, who's a surgeon. He always carries a pen, penlight, bandaids, toothpicks, business cards, and receipts and more in his breast pocket. I think that was over ten years ago and he still uses it! I thought it was really expensive at the time, but then I didn't even know that technology existed for people to buy then. I still think it's a neat idea to this day. I have to admit though, if you're one of those gel pen types, you probably won't like this pen. The ink is not a deep black and it operates as a regular ball-point, except much better in extreme conditions."
4,An enriching discussing of 'positive' emotions,"Kast is a Zurich-based Jungian analyst, but who has an ability to incorporate material from other psychological and philosopical schools, unlike her more ideological colleagues in the Jungian world. She provides a robust psychological discussion of material that is generally relegated to spirituality. Especially good is the discussion of the shadow side of joy, what she calls ""malicious joy"". She engages sucessfully ideas from Ernest Bloch and Albert Camus, though her perfunctory Jungian interpretation of the Greek myth of Dionysus is obfuscating and distracting."
1,Not The Ellen Burstyn,"Not The Ellen Burstyn film, EVEN THOUGH IT COMES UP UNDER HER NAME IN A SEARCH. BAD AMAZON BAD!!"
2,Even life beyond death wont save this one,"Typical B movie, try to be spiritual or serious. Same rank with day time tv show."
1,Resurrection Confusuin,"Thank all the reviewrs for the heads up. I assumed the film was the one Burstn was nominated for an Academy award. Guess not. The even pair it with Last Picturs Show ""if you buty these two together"" deal. What a ruse.I would think Amazon could get thier act together or maybe in some cases they ten to mislead the public. Thanks again I was able to remove it from my order.. Tough it sid 4-5 weeks for delivery. Who Knows."
1,This Isnt The Ellen Burstyn Version,The Ellen Burstyn Is Awsome But It Never made it to Dvd and thats a shame it went rare and out of print before it got a chance to make it to dvd but at least it made it to vhs
3,MOVIE: RESURRECTION,"THIS MOVIE MAY BE WORTH A PENNY ON DVD OR VHS & ETC. EXCLUDING THE SHIPPING FEES. HOW ABOUT THAT? YOU ALL.'' AND YES I HAVE JUST SEEN THIS MOVIE ON MY ENCORE CHANNEL. AND I'LL TRY TO WATCH IT AGAIN SOON, IF I'M AWAKE. ''TOOT A LOO'' THE END.''"
4,"Blow hot, blow cold","Blossoming Love; Her teenage girlfriends had laughed when Spring O'Hara revealed her secret dream of marrying Reed Caldwell. She'd spent the happiest moments of her life growing up with him, surrounded by their Canadian apple orchard.But after a tragic accident had left Reed as Spring's guardian, he'd decided to send her away. She'd vowed to hate him forever...until one day years later, he stood at her door as ruggedly handsome as ever. The season of warmth seemed to return when he brought Spring back to the orchard. But he'd hurt her terribly once-could she dare to dream again.That is what the back of the book says.What I didn't understand is if Reed sent Spring away because he was a young single man, and she was a young single woman. What changed for him to go get her three years later to live with him in the same situation."
3,Good cheap background music,"I'm a yoga teacher and I'm always looking for ambient music for my classes. It has to be something I can talk over. I purchase a lot of inexpensive cds with titles like, ""Morning Sunrise."" These types of cds are a hit or miss proposition. This one is a hit. The watery sounds can get people in a flowing, dreamy state. It's one of my favorite cheap cds."
3,Floor mats,"The ad for these floor mats indicate they're designed for the Jeep JK. They fit the Jeep pretty well, but there's no hole for the floor hook, so it doesn't take long until they're sliding around. If you get these mats, be prepared to find a way to secure them in place."
4,Little big but work great!,"Don't fit my jeep exactly right, but look great and get the job done! Will purchase again in the future - much much much better than cloth floor mats."
2,Hitachi UC24YFA 7-1/2-to-24-Volt NiCad/NiMH Pod Style Battery 3-Hour,The first unit burned up charging the first New Battery. Amazon quickly replaced it with no Problem. The second unit never showed the second battery charged but did charge it. Their electronic circuit is no where as good as the Makita chargers I use on a daily basis.
1,wrong dvd!!,"careful when you buy this. i bought it today and the dvd came as the final face off not battle for the bronze.im very pissed, i was eager to watch too!!"
1,Yu-Gi-Oh! It's Time to Suck on Ice!,"Yu-Gi-Oh! dub is a crappy series. There is no violence,swaring human sacrificing or anything like that! You have the crappy Heart of The Cards! The only dub season worth watching is Grand Championship!"
5,Not To Be Missed,"Lili Boulanger died at 25 years old, but her music has such a maturity to it. If you like the Mahler song cycles, I think that you would really like her work. ""Clearing In the Sky"" is a remarkable song cycle - highly suggested."
2,iBuyHerb is robbing people. Amazoners beware!,"The product was not bad quality nor was it in any way damaged or delayed in its arrival. But the fact of the matter is that buying it directly through Banyan Botanicals would have resulted in savings of at least $14, counting a ten dollar and 10% discount available to both new and old Banyan customers. iBuyHerb is robbing people. What stuns me is that I was robbed because I failed to check out Banyan Botanicals first. The product is now under a different listing with the same exorbitant price and shipping cost.Refined Sesame Oil - 1 gallon,(Banyan Botanicals)"
5,my brother sounds great,"not that i am biased or anything but i think the cd is great! The song that really speaks to me is ""make it so"" I think mr. daniels is inspiring and uplifting and has one of the most beautiful male voices that i have ever heard. i love you brother and keep up the good work god has a plan in store for you!!!!! ;)"
2,stay away from plastic,"Poor design and cheap materials on the handle. The back half of the handle broke off on first dive with normal use. Now the the rest of the plastic is starting to crack even though I rinse with freshwater after every dive. Bottom line...Avoid any dive knife with plastic parts. At least make sure they are not part of the structural components of the knife. On the other hand I love the Kydex sheath design, especially the straps that are made for quick release. Makes for easy on/off. Over all, if you are going to go with Kershaw, go for the Amphibian. Same sheath, better knife."
2,Not So High Quality,I have taken the knife on two dives and the blade is rusted. I thought good stanless steel didn't rust??!!??Not bad for a throw away!
2,determination of acid ascorbic in vegestable,Tilman methods for determination of ascorbic in vegestable
4,Serpentine Belt for Honda Odyssey,This belt fit perfectly in my 2005 Odyssey with the 3.5L V6 and VCM. Good quality and Made in U.S.A.
5,One of my favorite childhood books,"I loved this book as a child so much that a few years ago my mom special ordered it for me as a Christmas gift. I read it to my daughter now and she loves it too. The story is about a bug family where the dad is a ""daddy longlegs"" and the mom is a lady bug. They go shopping and buy potato bugs, squash bugs and silverfish to make for dinner. The book is full of clever narration using real bug names and the pictures are cute. There is a bug city parade, the bug family goes to the zoo (to see the camel crickets, and rhinoseros beetles) and in the end everyone goes to ""bedbug."" I highly recommend this charming book."
5,Task Doweling jig,"A high quality American made tool. Well built, very precise, easy to use. You truly get what you pay for with this tool. I highly recommend this product"
5,Red Oak,"Product was better than I expected. I loved using it as it was fun and more importantly, very accurate. I would recommend this to everyone. Good delivery time and a great value."
5,Looks great,"Looks great, was delivered in a timely manner and great value. I buy my daughter a stuffed toy every year during the holidays. It's a tradition to get her a different type of animal each year, so thank goodness there are places that make toys that aren't the standard Panda or bear!"
5,"Fantastic Product, Service, and Communication","Absolutely fantastic puppet. Very realistic looking, great material, plush, and overall great product. My 6 month old loved it and laughed hysterically at it! Service was fantastic, shipped quickly and was delivered as I expected. Would definitely purchase the same product (or others) from this seller. Thanks!!"
5,Quite life-like,This puppet is great. It is very life-like and detailed. My dog likes to chew on him a bit and he holds up well. Very soft and cute too.
5,Fun and fuzzy,"Once again, never disappointed with anything I order on Amazon. I actually had to order a second one, the first was for my grandson and when my neighbor's child saw it she loved it so I had to order a second one. Really very cute and fun."
2,"Will not scan objects, fuzzy at 1200 DPI","This is really cool scanner, it's everything the reviews say about it. Unfortunately I use scanners to scan really small objects. This scanner has a small depth of focus. At 1200 DPI it's focus was even out on a slightly wrinkled twenty dollar bill. The scanner just does not focus on objects. On my old HP Scanjet 4P, and my new HP ScanJet 5300C objects are in perfect focus. Also at 1200 DPI, the picture was a little misaligned. If you can spare the desk space, the HP ScanJet 5300C is a much better scanner."
1,Arrived DOA,"It's got a nice form factor; sleek look; is easy to connect. I spent several hours trying to get this thing to work to no avail. Error messages kept popping up with instructions to unlock the mechanism that secures the scanning piece while in transit, unplug the USB connector, reconnect, and try again. Time and again it simply did not work.The online Canon documentation was useless, and attempts to contact Canon through the web site resulted in an auto responder and NEVER any assistance from a subsequent inquiry to Canon based on instructions in the auto responder.Technical problems aside, if you are looking for a (Canon) scanner primarily for web graphics and don't need perfectly flawless scans, you can cut the price tag in half if you get the Canon 650u or spend a few bucks more for the metallic finish of the Canon 656u."
4,Great scanner for average user!,"If you can get past the installation problems that may crop up, this is one great scanner for the average person. It's easy to use and the resolution is excellent for what I intend to use it for. The biggest pluses are the small size and the absence of a separate power cord. The bundled software is easy to use and fairly intuitive. For most photos and documents, the resolution is excellent.On the negative side, I did have some problems during installation. The initial surge draws so much power from my standalone USB port, that it shut it down. I got around that by plugging the scanner in after booting up the port rather than leave the scanner plugged in. The installation documentation is also a bit sketchy and assumes that everything goes smoothly. If it doesn't, you're out of luck and left to trial and error. The website isn't much more help either."
3,"Clunky driver, good scans","This is a very good scanner, and the software bundle that comes with it is excellent in my opinion. However, the driver software is atrocious. I have original USB ports, a 4:1 USB expander, and a USB add-on card, all of these give the driver fits locating and then running it."
5,Awesome!,Rated one of the Top Scanners in Consumer Report. I've had it six months with absolutely NO problems. This is an awesome scanner! One of the nicest features is how thin it is. It's only about an inch and a half high. Remarkable Technology.
5,great scanner,it took very little time to set up and works like a charm. i've only had it for 1 month and haven't had any problems.
1,Warning!!!!!!!,"Beware before buying!!!I purchase this scanner a little over a year ago. It broke down in four months. After 4 one hour phone calls to thier tech. line, long distance (customer pays), they couldn't solve the problem. Then after dealing with customer service and another 4 phone calls they finally replaced the scanner.Four months later again.... it broke. Several more phone calls to thier tech. center and 5 letters to the customer service and CEO they finally replaced it again.WARNING- do not buy this scanner without an extended warrenty. I have had nothing but grief with it and Canon's represenitves!!!!They are now refunding my money in full! However I have spent countless hours on the phone, writing letters, trips to the post office for shipping, buying uneeded parts they recomended, and money, to recieve the help required!"
4,A Joy to use,"It took me all of 10 minutes to hook this scanner to my Mac and install all the software. I really appreciate the lack of a power cord and the slim sleek design. An included clip lets you stand the scanner on its side, so it takes up essentially no desk space. You can even scan in that position. The software has worked flawlessly and the choices of image editing software allows you to do pretty much whatever you want to the scans. I just tested the OCR software, and it too worked quite well, making only a few mistakes, primarily mistaking numbers for letters."
1,Worst experience ever --- do not buy this scanner,"In 30 years of dealing with electronics, this was my personal low point for an unsatisfactory experience. I purchased this new, and I spent parts of three days trying to get it to work and it never did. I subsequently came across another review posted here that refers to a loose USB connection on the back of the scanner and believe that is what I experienced. I returned it for a refund as quickly as I could and purchased an Epson Perfection 1240U, an absolute 5-star experience."
4,Was just too easy to set up!,"After having nothing but trouble with the HP 5300 ScanJet, I returned and bought this one, I couldn't believe all you have to do is hook in the usb cable install the software and boom you're scanning.I'm not that great at computer, learning as I go. But this thing is great.Still learning the software, and playing (that's why only 4 stars)."
3,$17.99 is a good price for this type of bakeware,"I purchased this based on my perfect experience with the Berndes loaf pan. I initially passed over this but I think this is a good deal that is lost in the midst of the wide range of prices for cake pans. ""Cast Aluminum"" is the stuff that Nordicware sells for $30 and up. These make very voluptuous hearts.This is also the perfect shape and size for homemade rice krispie treats. Mmmm."
2,Falsely advertised.,This book was not in very good condition pages were ripped and taped. A library card thing was taped to the front. It can't be given to my flower girl I need to now purchase another gift.
4,Maybe not for a nervous child!,This is a really nicely presented book but may not suit a child who is anxious about an upcoming wedding. Isabelle's nerves may lead to similar feelings in your flowergirl! Probably suit a slightly older flowergirl who doesn't take books too literally!
2,"Entertaining to read, lacking in too many areas","One of the best albums of 1970 (and arguably a top 100 record from 65-75) was the Grateful Dead's ""Workingman's Dead"". Instead of that album/cd - we get 1970 choices of Vashti Bunyan, Honeybus, Rodriguez, Family, The Carpenters, Soft Machine and Emmit Rhodes.Really, that's all you need to know. There are huge holes in every year and I know I could make a better list (and probably you as well if you are reading this review).Now this book is a fun read (particularly if you dig Planxty and Can - cmon you know those great bands and records - right???). This book is far from definitive and there are quite a few REACHES here. Being a Mojo creation, it's weighted very heavily with UK bands."
5,Amy O,My kids who are 2 1/2 and 4 loved this movie and couldn't get enough of it. I think the animation was wonderful and the storyline is awesome some people might not get that it's a representaion of God and us. I can't say enough great things about Max Lucado. He is doing great things for kids and adults!!
5,Perfect fit,The item was sent straight away and arrived safe and sound. It fits perfectly and resolved the issue I had with my car. Everything is working fine and without any problems at all. Fast service & good quality for the money.
1,Save your money,"There is nothing in this book that can not be gleaned from any book on basic woodworking and joinery. I expected a more specific discussion of the dynamic loads exerted on automotive wood framing and construction strategies to counter them. What is contained in this book is a chapter on shop safety, another on tools and saw set-up, one on wood types and characteristics, as well as one on basic joinery techniques. Other than the inclusion of some pictures of a few woodies and a few pictures of one wood framed early touring car body, there is little to differentiate this book from a basic, albeit well written woodworking text which should retail for about twenty dollars."
1,Nothing for Restoring Woodies,"As a woodworker with 20 years of experience I was interested in what it would take to apply my craft to an automobile. More than half of this book is just a primer on basic finish carpentry and what types of woods were used in ""woodies"". A total of 4 pages is dedicated to the general project sequence of how to work on a woodie car but nothing about woodies themselves. There is no discussion of how a body is attached to a chassis, no discussion of any disassembly, use or types of fasteners nor is there any detailed discussion of the differences in ""woodie"" types. This book has many glossy pictures but it does not in anyway prepare you to build or restore a woodie. It does give a good overview of types of woods and finished but you can get that for less then half the price (and more detail) at your local hardware stores. Go to any Woodie website for more education on woodie restoration. Disappointing!"
4,Music for the Whole Family,"While this CD may not be a soothing bedtime elixer, it is just what the Dr. ordered if you're looking for a fun, sophisticated selection of songs which will appeal to the whole family. While the previous reviewer didn't think it calmed her child for bed, the fact that this CD captured her daughter's attention and imagination suggests that these songs do indeed encourage cognitive development and music appreciation. And it doesn't hurt that the parents, grandparents and siblings of these young listeners will also find themselves humming along to this infectious collection of wonderful tunes."
5,Great CD with a hidden benefit for parents,"We have played this CD about a zillion times in the car. Parents will have to endure Raffi and a child singing Yellow Submarine, but that's a small price worth paying. I love several of the tracks on this CD, especially Iko Iko. My kids (ages 2 and 6) love all the songs. The two year old's favorite is Little Red Caboose, but she has also learned the backup vocals for Monster Mash. My six year old's favorite is Day-O. So both parents and kids can thoroughly enjoy listening to this CD, and even belting out some of the tunes themselves.But there is also a secret benefit, that you must not let your children in on. Although most of the songs are very lively, the last couple of tunes wind down the pace considerably. More than once, my little nap-avoiders have conked out before they got all the way through Mbube. It's worth having to listen to Baby Beluga."
4,"Concise, accurate, fair Windows coverage.","I purchased this book to assist in integrating Linux authentication with Active Directory. It provided about 90% of the information I needed, the rest came from the web. Offers a concise overview of Kerberos, pretty good coverage of interaction with Active Directory, and some great information on inter-realm trusts that was hard to find via Microsoft. All this talk of AD aside, plenty of high quality information here for the Open Source community."
4,Good technical overview of Kerberos,"This book is a rather complete technical overview of Kerberos. It starts with a technical overview, which is a big must to be able to configure and debug a Kerberos system. It then jumps to implementation and then ends with integration.The overview is rather short, but was sufficient to help me install successfully a Heimdal system on my BSD network. I would have like more informations on how to integrate Windows Vista and XP to Heimdal, but the book falls short on this.Overall, I strongly recommend this book to anyone who needs to install quickly and maintain a Kerberos system. No quick tutorial would be enough and Kerberos: The Definitive Guides makes it as short as can be."
3,Not as described,"The product description listed it as ""mint"" and ""collectable.""I took this to mean that it would be in the original packaging. I was disapointed to find it loose in the box when it arrived. One piece of the Sabbaticus Beast Tamer is broken; the link piece that connects it to the other pieces of the infernal parade is missing. I wish i was not decieved by the product description."
5,Great product,"It scans very good. The colors look correct and match what I scan. The speed it quite acceptable to me. It runs on a single usb cable with no other power going to it wich makes it great for hooking to a laptop. It is very light. I have not done this, but I could very easily unplug it and take it to work with me if I wanted to.I am very happy with it."
4,Great little scanner,Installation was no biggie for me even tho I'm still a beginner at this whole thing....My pictures are looking good....still have a couple of questions re: speed of the process and ability to crop my work. (...) I'm having such a great time with this little machine! Thanks!!
5,"My first scanner, and I love it! Great for personal use!","After much searching throughout the internet, I finally bought this wonderful scanner here at amazon.com. While I have used scanners before, this one truly blew me away. First of all, you cannot help but noticing the size. I live in a dorm at a university and it was the perfect size! It's only 1.3 inches thick. The USB power supply is also great for small spaces.The photo editing software is also nice. I took a scenic picture from my last trip to Peru and made it into a nice work of ""art"" with the oil painting feature in PhotoStudio 2000.This scanner is incredibly easy to install and use. Just press the purple button and go.I have a 300 Mhz. computer and I do not have any complaints about the speed of the scanner and the software. It'll scan a good quality picture in no time!And at the now reduced price (...), it's a great deal!"
1,The most user unfriendly software--,"I have an HP ScanJet 3300C and love it. It works well and is so much fun to use. I went to buy it for my sister and ended up with the Canon CanoScan. Set up was a breeze, not needing an outlet was great but, I thought I was going to throw the scanner out the window. It had the most user unfriendly and ridiculous software I've ever used. Because of this, whether or not the rank of the quality, I truly disliked this scanner and promptly returned it. I do not see what other reviewers see in this scanner."
4,Nice Listening Album.,"A Perfect Circle sounds like Tool only with more melody and less attitude. My favorite song was "" The Nurse Who Loves Me"". It was a good CD to just put on and let it play through."
4,"Good But I Wouldn't say ""Perfect""","A perfect circle's second album ""Thirteenth Step"" is obviously an even better album than their first ""Mer De Noms"". It has many enjoyable tracks and IS perfect until around track #9 where it seems they begin to get lazy, though it does end good with the final track ""gravity""."
5,Top of their game,"Three years after their incredible 1st album, APC has done it again. With the addition of Jeordie White and James Iha, (did not record on the album though) APC has a new, bolder, dynamic sound. Getting right to the point, it's an amazing album. The brightest moments being 'The Outsider', 'Weak and Powerless', 'Pet', and the single cover, 'The Nurse Who Loved Me'. It's different enough from Mer de Noms to make us wonder what the next original album will sound like."
3,Good but overrated by other reviewers here,"This is a reasonable album but too much of it slips quietly by and is quickly forgettable. There are some outstanding tracks though as have already been mentioned (Pet, Weak and Powerless, Blue and The Outsider) but they are in the minority. Far too many are mellow, overly-textured mood-tracks that end up creating an atmosphere but nothing else, and some of these are painfully drawn out. I'm not suggesting that there should be more catchy pop-rock but if you're honest this doesn't have a lot of replay value, well not for me anyway.Imagine prog-rock drifting off to sleep for the most part with the occasional hard-hitting nightmare to keep you interested.It's clearly a musical progression for APC, but it's also a step closer to the dusty end of my CD rack. Mind you, this album would probably like it there... it's quiet, dark and it wont get disturbed very often."
2,Not very good,"What I got was a case that was cracked in more than one place, a burn mark on it and very scuffed up. It was so bad that I replaced it with one of my own CD cases. The CD itself has scratches all over it. I'm surprised that it didn't skip anywhere."
3,Decent CD but not Maynard's best work,"Well just as the title says. I got this cd the day it came out , and well it is a decent album but sounds more like Tool than A Perfect Circle. So any real fan should enjoy it but if your looking for a cd with Mer De Noms sound to it dont buy this one."
2,What happened?,"I have an earlier mp3 download of this group, my how their genre has changed. I hope they find whatever sound they're after."
4,9/10,The cd was a bit scratched but it still worked alright. The only song that had issues playing was the first one which bummed me out a little but it was a great buy. The cover-book was missing.. (not that it mattered/ didn't buy it for the book!)
3,one trick pony,"Everything Maynard James Keenan puts out sounds the same. Sorry, can't get on the bandwagon with those who put their faith in APC."
3,If I wasn't a huge Tool fan this would be only 2 stars,"Although I do enjoy the song ""weak and powerless"" I did not want a cd full of that mellow just this side of metal kind of junk. Being a Tool fan I've tried really really hard to get into this cd but like APC's last cd its very difficult to do. I can't really say that any song has a Tool like quality so if you havn't heard APC before don't go buy this expecting another Tool album because its not even close. This cd will really make you miss the greatness of Daney Carey. Sadily because of this Tool wont start making a new album untill this summer."
5,This CD shows the talent that APC really has...,"This CD immediately caught my ears when the package came on. The CD flows like no other I have ever heard before. Although it isnt as hard as their first one, Billy and Co. really knew what they were doing. The only thing that kind of threw me off on this album was The Nurse Who Loved Me, when maynard says, ""she acts just like a nurse, for all the other guys."" I never thought I would hear Maynard say 'guys' but hey. Either way, this album is defiantly worth buying, and it is a good album for any listening mood."
2,enormous disappointment,"I really tried to love this album, but for those that were fans of the brilliant layering and depth of their first album, you will most likely be disappointed. I got past the first song, I thought, ""That was kinda cool I guess, a little minimalistic and 'toolish' for me, but I can't wait to see what's next."" After ""Weak and powerless,"" the album returned to the slow rhythmic Nu-Metal type sound. Gradually I became more and more irritated as I listened further. It was obvious to me that Maynard had a huge role in the writing process of this album. They sound like a totally different band. When I describe these songs as ""slow,"" I am in no way referring to ""3 librasesque"" slow songs that the apc fan may be familiar with, but minimalist to the point that the most common sound to emit from your cd player will be silence. The drumming, the little that there was, and of course Maynard's voice are the only saving graces to this otherwise horrible attempt at an artistic vision."
3,Poor packaging,"GREAT PRODUCT, but a poor packaging for the travel, it arrive with a corner of the case broken. So sad"
4,Enticing for the close minded,When I first was given this CD I wasn't very big into Perfect Circle or Indie Rock for that matter. The songs are completely amazing with fast and loud bass lines to the raspy vocals. I encourage anyone to buy this cd.
4,Ingenious,"This album haunts me. How much more could I put it. Gone are the slick productions and somewhat belting guitars of the previous album. What comes forth is a very stripped down emotionaly charged piece of work, that sends the listener into places you fear to tread.THe album seems to be somewhat conceptual about the madness of addiction and then finding redemption in the end. There aren't a lot of songs to crank, but the most powerful and best work on the album is incredibly airy, atmospheric, and electricaly charged.A haunting piece of work best put forth in tracks such as 'The Noose', 'Vanishing', 'A Stranger', and 'Gravity'."
4,a failure cover is almost definitely gonna get my attention,i like a band who can broaden their minds a lilin the thirteenth step its done with nurse who loved meone of my favorite songs off of fantastic planet an album by failureperfect circle fans believe me im not that big on perfect circle until i learned they can do something like thisthe album is not 100 percent a must to own but if you have 20 bucks laying around id use it on a pack of gum and this record
4,A Refreshingly Interesting Work,"For those who simply can't get enough of Maynard James Keenan, Tool's lead singer was kind enough to create this side project. On their second album, A Perfect Circle ups the creativity at the sacrifice of catchiness (for the most part), and so creates a work of art that will please devoted fans but will most likely not win any new ones. Metalheads looking for a Tool substitute will be pleased with songs like ""Pet"" which provide a bit of crunch, but for the most part light guitar and string arrangements are the name of the game. Don't get me wrong, the record is excellent and the talent of the musicians is apparent, but this is the type of music made for deep listeners. With that in mind, I heartily recommend this album, but rock fans looking for a Tool fix should look elsewhere, as this group is something completely different."
4,well pleased,i just got the cd on tuesday and havent taken it out of my sterio yet. from the moment the first song startes until the final note at the end of the last you know you got far more than you payed for. maynards voice accompanied by the rest of the bands music is almost angelic and breath taking is the only way i can think to describe it. it is a perfect blend of mild melodic spiritual songs and the more driving sound you are used to hearing from tool or of a perfect circle's first album. i have nothing bad to say about this album except i wish it was longer.
5,Buy this album NOW!!,"Rather than attempt to change their sound, A Perfect Circle manages to make `Thirteenth Step' more of a continuation to their debut album instead of a completely separate entity. However, the underlying concept to the new album as a whole as well as each musician that assisted and contributed in the creation of this album, make each track unique and individual. Maynard's vocal capabilities are much more prominent on the new album especially with the addition of the hauntingly beautiful harmony throughout many of the tracks. `Thirteenth Step' is a masterpiece in music. A must have for any music fan that enjoys an audibly mental roller coaster. The only downside is that it's only 50 minutes long but that's okay, because b the end of the last song, you'll want to start all over again."
5,This is real music not garbage,"This days most groups/bands only make music for money not only that but... the musicians themselfs dont make the music , they are just puppets for the producers they chose,this album is a rare piece in this comercial world.Each song is very good , you can listen to the cd over and over and over again and not get tired of it.The music in this CD is very complicated you need a lot of skill for playing some songs for example 07-The outsider just left me spechless when i heard it.2 of the songs from this album are trully beautiful that will awake some feelings inside you 04- blue and 09-the nurse who loved me.The last song of the album called gravity is a great great song to end the album it will leave you like in a peacefull trance.with this CD from now on a perfect circle is in my top 3 bands that i like"
5,Ear candy,"Yes boys and girls thats what this cd is all about. something sweet for you ears to process. Maynard James Keenan shows off his amazing vocals, and the talent of the bands on these instruments is just mind numbing. The whole cd is really good but I get trapped on the first 3 alot but it's not 2 good songs and the rest of them fillers. you guys know what I mean. If you want something you can enjoy from the minute you put it in and you batterys die. This is it. so pick up a copy and check it out for yourself."
5,no title,"okay forget what everyone else has been saying about,""oh the band is so melodic and this that and the other.what everyone wants to know is if the follow-up to Mer De Nom is as good as the original:simple answer...yes of course it not have been what some were expecting ,it might not be what some wanted to hear because they had in their minds what APC was to be.but,anyone who seen or heard the band Tool knows that Maynard plays to the beat of his own drums so,why do we expect his friends and fellow bandmates to be any different.so basically,if you what a well crafted cd then the Thirteenth Step is here for everyone's consumtion.and,for those who had/have an idea on what they expector expected to hear from APC,i'm so sorry you just out luck."
5,No complaints,"The product was in great condition, as described. Delivery was quick. No complaints or problems with the transaction."
5,A great underrated album,"As someone who owns over 200 albums,this is one of my top 5 of all time.The album starts of with the Package, a song that goes from dark to heavy in it 7 minutes of trance inducing vibes.Second is Weak and Powerless,I believe the first single,and then Noose which shows this band can come together to make a great song.BUT my favorite song and maybe their hardest track is Pet,a song that deals with the government trying to ""protect us"" from evil doers in this world.Billy is such a good guitarist and backround singer that him and maynard go off well as in that song.Lastly is gravity, a slow yet poingnant song to end this album.Even if your into metal or alternative you will like this well made complex album."
4,it could be better,"this cd is good to my personal opinion i have always enjoy any kind of music in where the lord maynard james keenan is in to but with this cd they kinda like where trying to do something too slow with too many ambiental music instead of more voice and guitar solos, making this review short is a good cd with 5 exellent songs but then goes too slow"
3,nurse song,"Actually this is just a quick bit of info. The song ""The Nurse who loved me"" was not a Perfect Circle song. It is a song by a band named Failure, who ironically enough are no longer together. I dont really like their version. Just wanted to clear a couple things up. Peace out! But check out Failure!"
3,Good...best? no,"I see this band/album as a toned down version of Tool designed to meet the needs of the masses who cannot become accustom to weirder, more original music. This album is undoubtedly good, nice vocals and rythms (guitar work is basic), in all reality this is probably the best album out in the past year that is in the popular category. But understand, in the popular category, not in every category. There are far far better albums (better than both APC and Tool) out there done by lesser-known bands, Porcupine Tree, The Mars Volta and Opeth come to mind.So my final suggestion, if your a person who is afraid of changing styles and stepping out and enjoying a very weird/different style and sound, but want more of the same stuff you enjoyed in the past. Then this album is perfect for you."
3,"Not quite Mer De Noms, but its stil good","i bought this cd thinking i was in for a hard rocking, APC album, but when i listened to it, i found that alot of the album is soft, more harmonized stuff. not that that is a bad thing, but its not what i suspected. ""The Package"" is a good 7-minute start to a promiseing album, but by the time ""The Noose"" rolls arround, im about bored outta my mind untill the last 2 minutes roll arround. My favorite track on the album is ""Pet"" because it is alot like Judith on Mer De Noms. All-in-all, Thirteenth step is an awesome album if your in a mellow mood, but if your looking for the hard stuff of Maynard's collection, I would sudgest Tool's ""Undertow"" or APC's ""Mer De Noms."""
5,just what i expected,"The perfect album is all what i expected, After a long wait we see now this is nothing like the album before, but a big step foward. Every song has its own view, but is unique is every way. A perfect circle delivers again. Exellent album,music and everything in between. BUY THIS ALBUM"
5,It definitely takes a few listens.,"As others have indicated, the first time I listened to the album, I was not particularly moved or impressed. But something in me knew that there was more to it. So, I turned up the volume and listened to it several times throughout the day. Well now I can't stop listening to it, and it will remain in my 3-disc changer for some time to come.For me, many of the new rock and metal albums out there grow old very quickly (new Metallica, Korn, Godsmack). Don't get me wrong, I like some of these albums, but there's just something about them that I get sick of after listening a few times. When this happens, I get a feeling that I didn't get my moneys-worth. Whereas some albums are quite the opposite (new Chevelle, Tool, Default, Revis). These albums have lasting power for me, and when I'm not listening to them, I'm thinking about listening to them. That speaks volumes.I highly recommend that you buy Thirteenth Step if you feel the same way."
5,Worth the wait,"Ever since A Perfect Circle's first CD, Mer De Noms, came out I loved it. I had listened to it over and over and over, waiting forever for a follow up CD. I had been waiting and was eager to listen to their second, Thirteenth Step. I got it right away and was not disappointed. Anyone who is a fan of A Perfect Circle or Tool will most likely like this one too. The songs have variety that make each one of them stand out from the next. Some songs in particular like ""Blue"" and ""Lullaby"" have been stuck in my head continously for the last few days! This is a CD that any APC fan must get!"
2,Weak and powerless record,"I am very dissapointed in this cd. The songs seem repetitive and not as full as Mer De Noms. Mer De Noms just has so much more atmosphere. Maynard tried too hard to come up with deep lyrics but only ends up sounding corny on almost every track. His singing is also pretty weak. ""Help me if you can..."" ""Help me understand..."" Never heard such deep lyrics in my life. There is no comparison between the lyrics as Mer De Noms which sound totally original while these seem more like they were written to attract whiny goth kids. This cd reminds me of how great of a record Mer De Noms is."
5,Thirteenth Step,"A musical genuis' known as A Perfect Circle have created a new masterpiece titled ""Thirteenth Step"". Includes James Iha, Maynard James Keenan, John Freese, Billy Howerdl, and James Osbron. It is the cd of the year. The 5 have created the most beautiful musical experience about the human emotion. Five stars and a must buy."
4,Second Installment,"I got this cd literally as soon as it hit the stores. Being such a big fan of A Perfect Circle, having being recommended them by a close friend, I just had to get the second installment from them. The band is back with an even more emotional album than their debut, Mer De Noms, and a new member Jeordie White(formerly Twiggy Ramirez from Marilyn Manson) as the bassist. Obviously if you've heard Mer De Noms, you'll agree with me that it would be totally worthwhile buying Thirteenth Step. Favourites include Pet and Crimes."
5,One word? Amazing.,"What can you say about Thirteenth Step? Wow! This album is amazing! I would buy this album just to listen to Noose. Not many albums out any more when you can listen to the entire thing over and over and just appreciate it more. This album acctually deserves 5 stars. The lyrics (as always) are simply a thing of beauty. Not much music is brought together as well as this entire album. Granted there is 2 songs for fillers but thats all part of a musical experience, like an intermission between acts. The album is a incredible."
5,don't fret precious im here,"When i first got this cd i noticed it was different from Mer De Noms (french for sea of names). The more I listened to it, i got the feel of the album, which i absolutely love. I do miss Troy and Paz, they were essential to the band, but they have moved on to other projects. Overall, I think this cd was the best released of 2003. The lyrics are amazing, and the music is so relaxing and unique. I hope we don't have to wait to long for the next album!"
4,I retract my last review,"This is not one of those cds that you really inhale the first time you listen to it. So after listening to it one time i stashed it away and didn't try it again till about a month later. Just thinking of all the time I spent not listening to this is depressing. heh heh. It's actually a very good cd. With songs like ""noose"" that attack these stupid buttholes that call themselves born again and suddenly they're releaved of any evil that they have done. Just all around great smart, rocking music. Still keep in mind though that even with Maynard singing that this is very diffrent music from Tool. So if thats all your after this may not be your album."
2,hardly worth the wait..,"Considering that Maynard is a musical genius, I expected more from this album than it delivered.A quick review of the tracks will give you the same impression I got - it was produced in a day.The lyrics on this album hardly compare to the masterpiece that was Mer De Noms. Every song seems to be a replica of the last with the exception of ""Weak and Powerless.""""Weak and Powerless"" follows the style of Tool right down to the music video, thus making it hard to believe it comes from A Perfect Circle.The rest of the album is a slow, spiraling circle to doom, definitely not music to drive by.Listen to it only if you have insomnia.Even with this said, it's not a bad album, just poorly produced. I'm sure that if they had given more attention their lyrics and music, it could have been better.Songs worth listening to: Weak and Powerless, The Noose, and Pet."
5,Welcome Back,I have waited three years for this album and I am very happy to say that it was worth the wait. Defintly music for the soul.
3,Not Your Best Effort,"Okay Maynard, we get. Some record company/exec has done you wrong. But do we have to hear about in every record? Resolve the situation already and stop writing songs about it. Like ""The Package"".The music in this new CD shows promise but is lacking any real appeal. The previous 'A Perfect Circle' CD showed much more promise with songs like ""Judith"" and ""3 Libras"", although the latter smacked of the resentment that I spoke of earlier. Still, its an excellent song.Nearly every song on 'Mer de Nom' is a winner, yet 'Thirteenth Step' seems to lack any passion or dare I say effort.I know it's very difficult to create as you do, so I wish you much success on your next CD.It tears my heart out to be so critical of this band because I loved the last CD as well as nearly everything by the band ""TOOL"" !!!I own every-single-thing that ""TOOL"" has on the market and I hope that there will be a new one soon!Best of luck guys..."
3,"This is no ""Mer de Noms""","""Thirteenth Step,"" I know ""Mer de Noms,"" and you are no ""Mer de Noms.""Historically 2nd albums are usually an artist's worst. While I hope there will be another, I also hope that this proves to be their worst. This album wanders aimlessly."
2,At least it's better than the first one,"This cd falls in line with the first Perfect Circle cd for me. I have been hoping that Maynard would duplicate the raw energy that quantify the early Tool albums, yet Perfect Circle (and the two recent Tool cd's) are huge departures from the early style. If you are looking for tight, early-Tool type music, this is not going to work for you."
2,Not at all what I expected....,"This album is nothing like Mer de Noms. Others may not mind that so much but if you are like me and loved ""Judith"" and the other rockers from Mer de Noms, you will more than likely be dissapointed. This album is very slow and somewhat depressing. The vocals of Keenan and Howerdel are nothing compared to those on Mer de Noms. They just seem so boring here.There is no standout on this album. All songs are slow and boring. I have listened to it five times to make sure I do not love it since I loved Mer de Noms and have loved everything by Tool but I still must say that I do not like it at all. I certainly respect the members of A Perfect Circle in their decision to make an album so different from the previous, I just do not like the direction they took.It will probably still be in the rotation for the simple fact that I love Keenan's voice but it will never be played as much as Mer de Noms."
3,Hand over the anti-depressants...,"I hate to give an album fewer stars just because it makes me feel rotten, but ""Thirteenth Step"" also bores me. It's repetitive and more than a little pretentious. The addiction concept becomes tiresome near the end. Download ""Weak and Powerless"", ""The Outsider"" and ""Pet"" and save your hard earned bread.Liked the cover art and music vids though."
5,one of the best ever,"this is a great album, every time I put it on i can't stop listening. It is disturbingly motivational for me."
1,disappointing,"I feel like every song, without exception, on this album falls short somehow. They are all missing the climax associated with Maynard's previous endeavors (the endings of Orestes or Thomas come to mind, not to mention any of tool's epic opuses).Don't get the wrong imprsesion from my rating, this album isnt THAT bad. I gave 1 star to perhaps better lower the total average rating because I know there are too many people who would give 5 star ratings to anything with Maynard's name on it. This album has potential but nothing stands out.That being said, the most tolerable tracks are: The Noose, Blue, and Pet."
2,Meh-,Is it just me? or is this getting old- Their 1st way their best- this just doesnt compare- Maynard is too much of a freak- and I dont buy his wierdo deal at all- F this band now- and F tool- way to much hype here
1,what a piece of garbage,this cd is horrible!!! omg i can't even compare it to anything cause it's just crap!!! sealed in a plastic cover don't get this album for nothing!!!
4,new to this sort of music but im beginning to really like it,"like everyone else, i think the noose is the best song on this album by far, but there are a few others i think are worth listening to as well. i have not been to exposed to this kind of music, i am used to vanessa carlton and michelle branch. i am still impressed with this different style of music. the song i like the least is the nurse who loved me. that is soo random!! anyway, the 2 fillers arent so great either. my fave's are weak and powerless, the noose, blue, and gravity. the outsider is good, but it is so angry, i will have to get used to that. over all a very good cd, well worth the 20 dollars."
2,Looking back desperatly towards Freshman Album,"I just bought the album today after much anticipation, and i honestly was expecting more. To put it bluntly, Mer de Noms (The First Album) runs Perfect Circles around Thirteenth Step. I would rate Mer de Noms a solid 4 stars, for those of you who wish to calibrate my judgement with your own. When i heard the first album, i knew after the first listening that it was going to be a favorite. I didnt feel that with this album, and its really going to have to grow on me as i listen to it more. The band, however, maintains its ""grenade with it's pin pulled"" nervous-calm that keeps it mellow and ultimately distinquishesit's sound from Tool."
4,A perfect cover,"The album itself is grea. As a long time fan of tool, I can see where maynard goes with this as compared to tool. I gave the album a 4 instead of a 5 because the song ""The Nurse Who Loved Me"" is a cover. Yes, a cover. Just look up the band Failure, on their album Fantastic Planet."
5,Exquisite liquid sound,"I was a little nervous as I unwrapped the cd. Quivering as I slid the cd into the player... I held my breath...OH-MY-GOD! I was not dissapointed. Maynard's voice electrified me. He continues to be one of my favorite vocalists in rock music. He puts so much feeling and energy into what he sings, you can't help but to be mezmerized by his voice. I recommend this cd for a thrill-ride that you will want to take over and over again."
5,Best album I've bought so far this year!,"Just because you may not like TOOL, does not mean you would automatically dislike APC. Maynard's harmonies are better on this album than any other, and you definitely get to see the softer side. Everyone needs to own this album."
4,More Tool influence then the last one...,"Just listen to the song ""The Package"" and tell me that doesn't give out the same feeling as the song ""The Patient"" from the Tool Lateralus album. Almost the same length, same build-up, same mood.That's probably why's it one of my favorite songs ;)Stand-outs:""Pet"" - I love the power in this song, the lyrics are just creepy as well.""The Outsider"" - Has a good flow, and maynards singing is excellent on this track.""The nurse that loved me"" - Cool little track.Downfalls of the album:1. The fillers. ""Crime"" and ""Lullaby"" are just some wacky instrumentals that dont really need to be on there.2. 7 years for this album... I was expecting alittle more, but my APC desires are satisfied, for now.3. Take out the two fillers, and maybe some of those slow pointless songs, you only got about 7 or 8 banging tracks."
5,Incredible,"This is by far one of the most musically talented bands on the market today. They're incredible composition skills blend broad dynamic changes and unique melodies with incredible vocals. The CD manages to be soothing, and at the same time, exciting. It takes a few listens, and its NOTHING like Mer de Noms, but well worth the fifteen bucks!"
5,AMAZING!!!!!,"This is one of the most amazing records I have ever heard. Anyone who says that they sound just like Tool needs to open their ears, mind and expand their horizons. You can hear how the songwriting and producing goes the next step when looking back to the debut release ""Mer de Noms"". The vocal stylings of Maynard are so intense and catchy. I don't know the words yet to the songs, however I find myself whistling the melodies. It's too much. I am curious to hear how this stuff sounds live. If there is any doubt to buy this record, forget about it. If you listen to it once and it doesn't click, take a break and try again later. Pet, The Nurse, and Blue are some awesome tracks, but then again, the entire CD is awesome so just listen to it and enjoy the journey."
5,Wonderful and Melodic....,"This cd is not what i expected. I loved the first perfect circle cd and almost all of tool's work. This cd is unlike any of it. I was really kinda upset when i popped it in my cd player and listened to it. It wasn't what i expected but by the third listen i knew it was a special body of work. If you listen to the radio these days you will hear mostly crap and this is a refreshing change. Wonderful lyrics and melodic music, much better than any of the rock radio mainstays such as Cold, Staind, or any of the other commercial metal bands."
4,Great follow up,"I must say that after reading the comments I will listen to the CD again and look at it from a different point of view. Weak and Powerless is a mind jolting piece! Perfect in every way. There are some other tracks on the CD that follow the same theme. I did like the first album more, but this one is unique and it has a different sound. Its not too different so that one wouldnt recognize APC is the group, but there is more variation in the music. Some of the lyrics are disturbing, but its all around good music. Have an open mind. I think its a great album and worth the money."
5,Wow,"I have to say i am more into the alternative scene rather than this. But since i first saw/heard ""Judith"" (i think the video was gr8) i fell in love with the dreamy feel that APC can deliver. It's nowhere else ... in the rock scene.I got 13th today ... listened to it a few times and i am already loving it. I think it's a gr8 piece of work."
5,Outstanding,"Once again A Perfect Circle has shown us that they are truly a one of a kind band. Their new album Thirteenth Step is both hypnotical and beautiful. This band has so much talent, you are doing a disservice to yourself by not buying it. Singer Maynard James Keenan of Tool fame shows us that A Perfect Circle is not just some side band, he gives 100% of himself to this music, as does the rest of the band. The result...utter and complete pleasure for all."
1,lame,There is nothing on this cd that grabs my attention. I've listened to it several times and I just cant get into it. Mer De Noms is good but this cd is is plain boring.
2,Took Maynards word and fell back asleep,"This is one of the most dissapointing albums i have ever bought, and it scares me to say this about Maynard James Keenan's band. I never cared much for Mer de Noms though it was decent, but this is a sheer disappointment. I do not enjoy the popularity of this album because that may draw attention to Tool and hurt their music as it did this. This album is WEAK & POWERLESS. I swaer I had to turn my stereo to the highest level of volume to hear this. Good songs are: ,end of #1, #2, can't think of much else. And to RIAA, like to let you know I sold this Cd & burnt it. Yeah, I made a copy of this & it works. I would tell you how to do it but it is insignificant to this review. I recommend you BURN this CD and don't buy it, for you will be in total disgust of your waste of well earned money."
5,It is what it is.,"If you are looking for a Tool record or even a repeat of A Perfect Circle's first record, you will be a bit disappointed with this one. Remember that Billy didn't write ALL the songs this time, and it's been almost four years since MDN was written. Of course they will sound different now.And if they didn't, that's what you would all be complaining about.Just listen to it without a comparison in back of your mind."
3,Naturally.....,"Well, I was initially a little baffled. Not much like the first A perfect circle, but still pretty good. It's only natural to expect the same kind of feeling from a band and them be completely turned around when it isn't delivered. The album is definitely significant in my choice of music, delivering not only mind-pondering, but emotionally erratic tunes. Peeps, a good buy, by all means."
3,Slightly disappointing,"I don't like this one as much as I liked Mer de Noms.I tend to think of A Perfect Circle as Maynard getting in touch with his feminine side--it's softer, prettier, breathes a little more. And, the first CD was just gorgeous--this is more a reversion to type, too much Tool in it."
2,Wheres the brilliance we keep hearing about?,"ANTICLIMATIC is the word..this album takes you on a ride to nowhere... where is this brilliance i keep hearing about? i dont see it on this album, albiet the drummer is excellent however.Im sick of hearing 'you gotta look behind the music' and all things similar.. i know music and this CD is plain boring.. its like they took too much acid and forgot to play songs that go anywhere... im sick of hearing about the genius of perfect circle.. how about listening to opeth's 'damnation' thats brilliance showing that in fact, 7-8 minute song CAN go places... --i wish tool would make a revival... maynard seemed to suite it to a tee."
4,"Pretty good, Anathema is better and original","This is pretty nice laid back, enchanted music. I like all the songs but still enjoyed the music of tool better. Though I was always trying to find a more laid back version of tool with a darker, more melancholy mood. To me a very unknown english band more than fills in that void, a band called Anathena. I so happened to come by the album by a refrence from 10 years review. I cannot believe the album isn't very popular in the states, it amazing, layred, melody's flow from it and you become obsorbed in the etheral state it puts you in. If you like this 13th step, check out Anathemas judgement, or any other album, it smokes maynards side project, but is right up there with tool, just more laid back."
1,WARNING COPY PROTECTED,"yeah, its true about the extra fade out minute ending on ""package"", but the import version is also copy protected. this cd cannot be played on real media player, real juke box, real player, or itunes. WHICH MEANS THIS CD CANNOT BE PUT INTO YOUR IPOD. the cd and the cd case has copy contoled logo stamps all over it too... cd only recomended to people who listen to their music using a cd player or stereo. also, the extra minute isnt worth the extra $20 you should rather be spending supporting a artist/record label that doesn't put anti-computer playback on there cd's."
4,Very Nice Thank you,"All music should be available on vinyl. It's a shame that convenience supersedes quality. But then again there is a lot of ""music"" that deserves a swift exit and doesn't deserve to be preserved."
3,Not bad but not great,"I wasn't too thrilled but I wsn't let down. the songs are either really good or really bad. The Package is really cool. it sounds cool as hell live. Weak & Powerless can use some work. The Noose is okay. it sort of gets old. Blue is terrible. the opening guitar sounds okay but the rest of it sucks. Vanishing is cool. it was a good intro. A stranger is okay. not great butnot terrible. The Outsider is cool, the only track Maynard screams on. The Cd can do well without Crimes. or the track should have been worked on more before it was released. Te Nurse Who Loved Me is okay. Pet sounds cool but it could use a little bit of work. Lullaby is okay. Gravity is okay I don't like how the resonancein the middle goes no where. in all this Cd has lots of potential. it could have used more studio time. especially with Maynard being high on all his drugs. also with all the interlude type songs there show be more that aren't interlude type."
4,Thirteenth Step - A Perfect Circle,"Quite the opposite of the first album, Thirteenth Step takes the listener on another journey - a new road perhaps, showing the different sides of the members who are currently 'A Perfect Circle'. This side project highlighted by Maynard of Tool (or at least drew the interests of many), which seems ever evolving and changing, has done nothing but brought music created from the hearts of the group for the listeners - not for the record label.If you're looking for another Mer de Noms or TOOL CD, don't look here. I went expecting something new... and I got what I wanted. Check out target/bestbuy... I picked mine up for about $10.... can't get better than that..."
4,Their best yet,"I was really looking forward to this CD coming out, and I'm glad that I didn't wait. This CD is their best yet!"
2,A Perfect Sleep,Got it this morning. I thought it might be as good as the last one but instead I nearly fell asleep. (at work)Not impressed. I hope it grows on me!
2,Hooray......,".....for uninspiring music. What is this? The entire album is very repetitive and lacks any emotion or musical qualities that the first album offered. I can't believe the same musicians made this????Yes, it's soft. I have no issues with that. But all the songs lack any qualities that grab your attention. It's like they were zombies while making the music. Going through motions. The woman from the first album isn't in the band any longer. Maybe she had artistic input that is sorely lacking now? Either way, this is awful. This whole whispering thing is irritating.....and songs which are short still contain fluff. The complaints I have with this music are very similar to issues I have with Tool's ""Lateralus."" Interesting........Don't buy it."
2,PLEASE,ok...i love art rock. i love any music that incorparates any sort of artistry...but it has to have some sort of groove! this has nothing...i've listened to it 3 times now and i still can't get a grip on why i should care? 5 stars? not even close. Anyone who gave it a 4 or higher needs to expand their musical horizons.this is not revolutionary art rock. this is blah... nothing but fluff and b sides here. what a dissapointment after such a killer first album.
3,Maynard's Trip Through the Mundane,"My title might be a little bit harsh. I have listened through this whole album to realize that i've heard most of it before... Compare this album to Tool's newest, with (a perfect) spin on things. This is the first time i have heard Maynard experiment so much with his voice. The experience is awe-inspiring, only a few have his range of sounds. Mix that with very melodic guitar and bass lines and you get a very interesting but mediocre overall musical experience. There are some songs that stand out, i.e. Outsider and The Package. Overall, i'd say buy it but I think you could only listen to this CD a few times with interest. If this is your first experience with A Perfect Circle, go with their first album and let it amaze you."
3,Hmmmm,Its good but it could be so much better. Just listen to mer de noms and you will see why I think so.
2,Another Disappointment,"I didn't like the last album very much. It was pretentious and boring and the production was like a layer of plastic wrap pulled tight around the band that the music just couldn't get through. Granted, the production on this one is better, they have managed to open it up a bit, but the music is just as dull. The last album had some good songs, but not enough to justify repeated listenings. This album is the same way. My recomendation: save your money and listen to your Tool albums."
3,Unthrilled.....,"With the departure of Paz Lenchantin from the group, the rythm and flow from the music has been somewhat lacking. Mer De Noms has been one of my all time favorite albums, and by that I was expecting a beautiful flowing group of songs to include tracks ranging from the slow ""Three Libras"" to songs like ""Judith,"" and ""The Hollow."" Yet I find myself thinking they are sub par and there is something lacking, maybe due to the fact Paz Lenchantin's Departure from the group for unknown reasons, or just the dramatic feel has just left the group, nevertheless it was an album that I would put in my cd player from time to time, yet I would not recommend it to a fan of the Band's first album."
3,Come on!!,CD of the year. Best ever yet. Lyrics great. It gets three stars becasue Tool has been beening getting better and better this rates my lowest for Tool and Perfect Circle. It took a step back for me but still pretty good.
5,Temporarily Pacified,"This is NOT a Tool CD. If you need Tool, buy a Tool CD. (They should have a new one out in about 4-5 years).This is not Mer de Norms (Thank God). If you need Mer De Norms, buy it.What this is is a work of art, a creation of a group of artists who clearly aren't interested in making the same album over and over. If that is what you want see ""Boston."" If you have an open mind and enjoy undefined rock, then you have found gold. At times this album rocks harder than anything I've heard. See ""Outsider."" Its one of those albums (like ""The Fragile,"" that needs to be heard a number of times bfore the genius reveals itself. And with each listen it only gets better. Though I don't like waiting for Maynard-involved CD's they lately have been well worth the wait. If you don't like this album, perhaps you need recovery yourself."
1,Pure Crap!,What a load! These two baldinis need to get jobs laying brick and quit the music biz. They take themselves way too seriously for their ridiculo musico. If you're a 13-year old boy you'll like this album. Anyone with an ounce of education with see through the pretentiousness. What the hell happened to this band????
1,BBBBBBBOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRINNNNNNNGGGGGGGG,I fell asleep listening to this!!! dear god...i don't even think there's a guitar riff on that CD
2,Wrong TOOL for the job?,"I'm a long time TOOL fan... so there was a reason why I didn't and haven't bought any PERFECT CIRCLE albums, which is pretty much the exact opposite why so many people DID by APC albums. Well, I finally borrowed this from a friend and I was right, it's just a fat strip of jerky, when you really need the steak. Musically, it's not bad... but it ain't nuthin groundbreaking... And, by no means is this the greatest album of all time... To me, I just can't see how, when these guys are ""Rockin' Out"", they aren't sayin' to themselves, ""yeah, this is just like TOOL... Heavy, Yeah... we rock!"" Even if TOOL's guitar tech started the band, I don't care, too many Adam Jones elements in there to be considered original. And the lighter stuff is just nu-metalish wankery... And to top it all off, the whole ""Supergroup"" thing is just a little much. Maynard, please... round up the boys and blow our minds again..."
5,The best album out right now!,"I liked Mer De Noms, but I wasn't ecstatic about it. I am quite honestly disappointed with much of the music being released these days and cannot name many bands that have captured my attention.However, ""Thirteeth Step"" far surpasses my expectations of the new APC CD. I am simply blown away by the emotion in this music. I captivates me and holds me through the entire album. The Noose is by far my favorite, and is spooky in a way of its own.My friends who I have had listen to this have mostly not heard of or not had any interest in APC. Now I have changed their minds. One just wrote me an email to say she was buying ""Mer De Noms"" because of the ""Thirteenth Step"" album."
5,A Perfect CD,"What can I say about this album. It is a gem. I suggest all of you to get up and run out the door for this one. The songs on this album aren't necessarily heavier than those on ""Mer de Noms"" but they are more perfected. The intro song, ""The Package"" is a great song, it has that TOOL feeling in the form of A Perfect Circle. The wailing voice of Maynard fits this song perfectly, and the guitar work is well done. ""Weak and Powerless"", well there is enough said about this song, one of the best on the album. These are other songs I enjoyed, ""The Outsider"", ""The Noose"", ""Blue"" and ""Pet"". Well I'm done ranting and raving so go get this album its just as good as ""Mer de Noms'."
3,"An Excellent CD, but Canadian buyers beware!","Firstly, I must say, I love the CD. Different from Mer De Nom, Thirteenth Step is much more mellow. The single ""Weak and Powerless"" is the ""heaviest"" song on the CD.The CD itself is not my main reason for posting this review, I feel I should inform the consumer of what they're buying when they get this CD.The Thirteenth Step is COPY PROTECTED. What does this mean? The CD is a data disc, it may not play in older stereos and certain CD players. Also, its designed to be unrippable, meaning no mp3s. My CD-ROM couldn't rip the tracks, but my DVD-drive was able to rip the tracks just fine (lucky I guess). Shame on the record companies for deciding how the consumer should listen to thier music.The US copy is apparently non-protected, so if you're aching to make mp3s (I own a MiniDisc so I need the mp3 format), you might be better off ordering from the US.5 stars for the CD, minus 2 stars for the copy protection. 3 stars overall."
4,Great Album,"Agreeing with every other reviewer, this album is as outstanding as the last one. In answer to a former reviewer who didn't understand ""The Nurse Who Loved Me,"" the song is a not-very-good cover of an outstanding song by the band Failure (whose album ""Fantastic Planet"" is highly recommended). In closing, just get this album. You'll love it."
5,Incredible,"This is a beautiful piece of art work. Thought provoking and incredibly more mature than their previous release, Thirteenth Step solidifies A Perfect Circle's position as one of the greatest bands of current times. Many of the songs are much more mellow, but just as passionate as the work in Mer De Noms. Maynard's vocals are just as haunting as ever. Be sure to check out this amazing album."
4,A Little Different,"The CD is a little different from Mer De Noms, but is good nonetheless.COMPUTER WARNINGThe only thing I would complain about is that the CD has some sort of copy protection on it that blocked my computer's access to it. I had to play it through Windows Media Player and rip it to .wma format."
4,A Much Needed New Sound,"At first this album seems like a far cry from Mer de Noms, but give it time. APC takes a different approach to this album, so if you're just looking for a catchy tune, look elsewhere. However, if you give this album a few listens, you'll be able to appreciate its subtle nature. The Noose is probably the best track on the album, complete with some of the best lyrics I've heard in a while. There are plenty of majestic sounds on this album, and they will take some getting used to. However, it's been a LONG time since anyone has produced a truly new sound, and APC delivers something that defies definition here. Like the sound or not, APC goes a long way in defining themselves with this album. But if you're not into mind-bending melodies, stick with Tool."
2,fails to grab my attention,"This cd lacks anything outstanding. Musically they havnttried anything new.Maynard sounds like Cher now, gone are the days of himholding a scream or tone for 10's of seconds on ends."
3,Not Quite A Perfect Album,"After the excellent single Weak and Powerless, and the brilliant debut album Mer de Noms, this album does not quite live up to my expectations. Maybe they are too high but for mine this album is too soft and seems to fill a couple of tracks with less than what you would call a song.In saying the above, it is important to also note that there are a couple of other good tracks on the album! Pet instantly stood out as a cracker. It is a heavier number and just seemed to remind me of what A Perfect Circle were all about on Mer de Noms. The Package and Gravity are also very good songs."
3,"Not as good as hoped, but still quite good","The thing about this CD...if you're expecting ""Merde De Noms II"" you're going to be disappointed. Who wants the same stuff twice anyway? ""The Thirteenth Step"" is much darker, yet not as heavy as ""Merde De Noms"". It takes a few listens to appreciate, not like MDN which is an instant favorite from the first spin. Stick with it, you'll be glad you did."
2,Not happy.,"I have to start off by saying that I loved Mers de Noms. I thought it was brilliant. That is why I had such high expectations for Thirteenth Step. Each song is quite good, but when you put them all together on a cd the overall tone of the songs make the cd seem slow, and dare I say it? Boring. Like I said, each song is good, but overall it's not too exciting. I still love A Perfect Circle though, and hopefully they come out with a dvd soon."
3,What a let down!?!,"What happened to the band with so much promise?. After listening to this CD about 10 times now, I have to say that I am indeed disappointed with this effort. It sounds to much like TOOL in spots. Quiet and plodding is the best way to describe it. The last CD was grooving big time, while this one never really gets started. Sure the lyrics are interesting and it has it's spots of greatness, but unfortunately those spots are to far apart for a cohesive effort. If it had more heavy spots tossed in here and there, I would have given it a 4 or even a 5, but it doesn't and that in a nut shell is the problem with this effort. A dud for sure"
3,A comment after reading previous review...,"I should add to inform those who don't know that the song ""The Nurse Who Loved Me"" is a cover of a Failure song of the same title from the Fantastic Planet album."
3,Alright I guess,"Well it isnt really what I was hoping for. Only 3 tracks with ""meaty"" guitar work. Track 12 is a complete joke, why even bother putting that crap on there? If there was just a hint of heavier guitars I would of given this 4 stars. No way in hell is this a 5 star album. But I am pretty strict in my grading. Like someone else mentioned it's a good buy if you can get it this week while its on sale ( I got mine $$$$ at .... Please dont spend $$$ at the mall for this (not worth it). Or just wait and buy a used copy because there will be plenty of people who will be dissapointed in this. Perhaps it will grow on me but at first listening not one song really grabbed me. But hey, lets be real about one thing. This still blows any of that nu-metal radio rock away. But I am just one man with one opinion. So if you want it buy it."
5,Hard to put my finger on.,"I was kind of baffled and confused initially upon listening to this album. It was more mellow than expected. The first Perfect Circle was like ""Tool - Light"" and this album was ""A Perfect Circle - Light"" in comparison.It took a good two or three listens before I really got comfortable with the sound (which I will without question say started and stayed very beautiful). This is a perfect example of WHY A Perfect Circle is so good. They can play music the way it's SUPPOSED to be played, but do it in a manner that's DIFFERENT. This is a refreshingly GOOD album and will diversify and beautify anyone's record/cd Collection."
4,A bit of a letdown,"Alright, this wasn't as good as Mer de Noms, let's just say that right off. It was too soft, too mellow, and it never seemed to crest.But the vocals kick butt, as always, and I have a special affection for it as Twiggy, once of Marilyn Manson, joined it. The only song I adore on here is Pet, Track 10, which I've had on loop all day. It's a five-star song, but the rest drags it down. I seem to have a thing for Perfect Circle's tenth tracks, as both Pet and Thinking Of You have been my easy favourites on their respective albums."
4,Greatest moments of rock in my life... followed by....,"The Noose. Need I say more? The song builds and grows as it progresses, until it climaxs right as you do. I would choose this cd over mer de noms any day. Maynard rules. A Perfect Circle is even better live with James Iha leading the guitars."
5,American non-spanish speakers review,"This album is Pablo Montero's best! I have his other 2 CD's and I do not even speak Spanish! I am American and I found out about Pablo because my husband is from Mexico and watches the Spanish TV. The music on this CD is the best, especially the title song! I love Pablo's voice, it is the voice of the Angels."
5,Sultry jazz to the max...,"This cd is sultry jazz to the max from begin to end...""You Might Say - Bugge Wesseltoft"" is my fave cut, though I really like them all... If you're a downtempo/jazz/lounge DJ, then you absolutely need this... Either way, a jazz music fan or DJ - you need this cd in your collection... Peace at ya - DJ Dakini-NYC..."
1,Not very pleased,"I purchased this CD along with ""Sirens of Song"". I listen to Sirens all the time, but not at all to this CD. This has a very modern sound that is not pleasing and certainly not classic in nature. This CD is well produced, but will only appeal to those who enjoy the modern jazz sound."
3,"Useful, flawed","Garber and Ariew did us a great service in pulling these materials together in a single inexpensive volume in English. Their choices for inclusion are terrific. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for their translations. Especially in the translations from French there are dozens of errors, many of them fairly serious. If you would like a list of them - or of the ones I have noticed"
5,Very cute!,"These are very cute horses. They are a perfect size for Barbie's little sisters, but would be a tad small for Barbie to fit on them. My daughter, five, picked these out for her friend's sixth birthday and we paired it with Stacie, a smaller doll. She was absolutely thrilled with them."
4,Startlingly human electronic music,"Sunkings Soul Sleeping is more often in my computer's cd player than in my hi-fi. Why? Because it's an introspective record, better listened to while homecomputing than socializing. It eschews the tediously careful construction of so much electronic ambient/industrial and is much more emotional. Pick it up - it's well worth the investment - but set aside 74 minutes to listen to the entire record. It's intricacies depend upon the context it creates, and you kinda get out of it what you put into it."
2,Sunkings  - Soul Sleeping,"The Sunkings dropped SOUL SLEEPING as trance was steadily becoming the genre du jour of techno. Blue Room, in particular, was a label well-known for trance, and the traces of this are immediately evident in the drone and beats of ""Tongues of Fungus,"" but with the sonically dense, atmospheric ""Flesh Canvas,"" there's nary a cheesy trance riff to be found. This wears off quickly, however, as ""Isle of the Departed"" wanders a bit too much with its prog-rock guitar and sub-Lisa Gerrard vocal (""Eden Reprised"" loses the guitar, but retains the vocals, unfortunately). ""Tang"" delivers prototypical psy-trance, and the other tracks seem to meld together in a indistinguishable drone. The breaks on ""Talisman"" break things up, but it's a little too late. Might be better to sleep on this one."
5,Another great item from Gardenside,"Attractive, sturdy table and really easy to assemble. (Recommend adding some silicone sliders to the legs before you assemble it; the table is heavy and a bit awkward to move around otherwise.) The teak wood is nice and smooth - no splinters here! And no problem getting an umbrella positioned through the center hole."
5,Nordic tales at their best,"This is yet another work that is simple to grasp and thoroughly laid out for the reader. The index and glossary cover it all, and make finding things easy. The illustrations go well with the book and you can get an idea from the artist's perspective, the outward meaning that the myths try to convey. Beauty, form, courage.... The images in the pages help when reading to children, and the wording is easy enough for even the young to grasp. Don't miss this book, and try to get Kevin Crossley Holland's book on Norse Myths as well as Masks of Odin by Titichenell for the REAL meaning behind the ""myths"". Remember, trust your blood and follow your ancestors."
2,Inaccurate. Better is available for free here,"Fairly well written, but I didn't even have to read all the way through to find this to be inaccurate. If you want something factual, there are many other accounts of actual historical events and many legitimate sagas. This also goes for mythology. This is NOT the only book - and by far not the best - that talks about Norse history/mythology.Anyone interested can find free Kindle editions of ""Children Of Odin"" and the Volsunga Saga. I am yet to find anything free on Harald Fair-Hair unfortunately, for this is one of my favorite sagas that should be included in the Heimskringla.If you care to do some translating yourself, the Fagrskinna and Flateyjarbok (I am too lazy to find the accent marks in the actual titles). Look some of these up. They're all in a very simple style and very easy to understand.Happy reading!"
4,Very Interesting. Great Read,Bought this book for a STEAL on via Amazon's Warehouse deals and found the part of it that I read to be very interesting. It now has a home at my family's north Georgia cabin. Very interesting stories. Great read.
2,"If you haven't read it some place else, then read this book",This is just a repeat of the many books that are already on the market. No new information is revealed from what the other 100 books have already presented.
4,Great show,"I remember watching this as a kid. Show is great and I love that they teach you lessons instead of mindless antics that most cartoons today are made of. DVD was nice for the money. They could have put a little more effort into the menus, but for the money you can't complain."
5,The Littles The Complete Series,The Littles Compete series was a ABC series based on the children books. Some of the episodes include the original ABC commercial bumpers and all the episodes include LITTLE IDEAS FOR BIG PEOPLE where kids are show how to make the type of stuff The Littles characters use in that episode. The DVDs are separate containers instead the box so one doesn't have to worry much about the disks getting loose or scratched during shipping like sometimes happen with the fold out series boxes. Dinky Little is the one who personality changes most between books and show as he is used for comic relief in the TV series with the way he always messes up and get in trouble. The set also include all three versions of the opening theme.
4,Pleased,I recieved my order promptly and without damage. I am very pleased with the product and the speed and ease of the whole process.
5,GREAT!!,Item great. Great price. This is a wonderful cartoon. So glad to find it at such a great price. Thanks
4,Great Text,I have an amateur interest in logic and math. I found this text to be very methodical and terse while remaining accessible. This is a book that I will keep going back to. If like me you don't like the new fad popular science presentation of academic material but rather something a bit more stripped away then you will really enjoy this text.
2,Propaganda - A self serving attempt to (re)write history,"Leopold uses the book as a tool to push off any remaining stigma of his crime on his dead partner and to boast about his ""charitable"" works in prison - most of which were done to make prison life bearable for himself or to increase his chances of parole more than to help others. He selectively leaves out details of his activities that paint him in a negative light. The book is a must read, however, for anyone who seriously wants to learn about the case, but it should be read alongside a more objective account such as that by Hal Higdon."
5,It works.,"Helped me repair my air bed that had a small hole after a 6 years old punctured it on purpose.My guest sleep on that bed it for two week, no problems."
2,Messy and Ineffective,This was properly packaged when Amazon sent it to me but the tube of glue was still broken open somehow on the bottom of the tube and leaking out. When I opened the glue I held it for one second upright while I grabbed the patch. The expansion in the tube made it leak out and it got everywhere. It was a huge mess. The directions are very vague and even though I clamped the patches there still somehow managed to be air bubbles with the patches. This was awful. I will not buy this again.
3,It still leaks some air out,I bought this product to fix an air mattress. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but it still leaks a little bit.
2,Barely worked,I had high hopes for this product but barely work for me. I used it several times and I still had a leak in my air bed. I would suggest finding another product.
2,Not effective,"Unfortunately, the repair kit did not work on the air mattress which had a tear. The tear was v-shaped and kept getting larger. Maybe the kit would have worked for a smaller tear or puncture."
5,saved the airbed,We were ready to throw away the airbed (Coleman). This patch was easy to put on and worked just fine. We used the bed every night for two weeks after repairing it. Would recommend the patch kit.
4,Does the Job,For pinholes and slits less than 1 inch (25 mm) this kit will seal it. Four patchs and plent of solvent-glue.
2,Good for few days.,"Good for few days and it leaks again.This product's instruction book is really lame! It doesn't tell you which side you should use ( the pad has two sides, and each side has different texture.)The gel enough to be used more than 10 times, but it only comes with 4 pads which is really a downer."
3,More please!,"Alex Ross's art, as usual, is gorgeous and a joy to behold. I have framed posters of his Wonder Woman and Aquaman hanging in my gym as testament to my admiration of his work. Alas, the pages in JLA: Secret Origins relating to Superman, Batman, Captain Marvel and Wonder Woman have been reproduced from previous books (Superman: Peace on Earth, Batman: War on Crime, Shazam! Power of Hope and Wonder Woman: Spirit of Truth) - all of which I already own. That made me feel a little cheated, but I guess I'll just have to wait a little while for his upcoming new JLA project. However, the full spreads of the JLA assembled still make this book well worth another look. Buy this book by all means if you do not already own the afore-mentioned books."
4,Unexpected,"It's not a typical title. Not a story. But rather delicate snapshots of all your faves. Supes, Bats, WW, Hawk, MM, etc. Very well drawn. I assumed it was a regular title, but I wasn't disapointed. Know that it's huge. Like eighteen inches tall and probably twelve wide, so don't make the mistake of thinking you can cart it around in your backpack."
5,"Offers a lot of Option, Saves a Lot of Time","I have used this in several 'scopes, including a little Orion Skyscanner 100mm Dob, a 90mm Mak, and an Orion 6"" Dob. With all of these, the Meade has proven itself a versatile observing accessory. MUCH less time spent in-and-outing of eyepieces. You can run the Meade up and down, expand the FOV or close in for a tighter view until you find that sweet spot somewhere in the 8-24 range. Images are sharp, resolution very good. A quality piece"
1,I've Heard Better,"Simply the most boring, non-active concerto I've ever heard. One of the movements even sounds like an ice cream truck music box! There is no Rhyme or reason to this uneventful concerto. It seems that effort was small,and there is no attempt on a melody. If you want to hear what concert music is really about, listen to Rachmaninoff, Liszt, Brahms, Schubert, Tchaikovsky, Bortkiewicz, Chopin, Bach,Smetena, Saint Saens, Mendelssohn, Faure, Verdi, Gershwin, Mozart, Paganini, Barber, but don't listen to this guy. Its a waste of money."
3,Not worth the full price,"I enjoyed this video. Yet, I felt that ""If Only I had a Green Nose"" was much better. The quality of the video could be better. The storyline is good."
1,I'd rather watch paint dry.,"I've been watching this steaming pile of feces on tv for 85 minutes and I just can't take it any longer. Well, that's not entirely true. I've mostly been watching a cricket on the outside of my window. It has moved so little that I'm not sure it's alive, but it's way more interesting than Ghouls. Better plot and dialog, much more realistic special effects. I could tell you what's wrong with this flick, but I value my sanity too much to think about it. Besides, it's so easy to tell you what's right about it: nothing. Not a thing. Nada. Zip. It's not that I don't like z grade horror movies. I've cheerfully rented and then bought many horror flicks so bad that I would be ashamed to name them. But even I have some standards. Excuse me now, I have to go whack myself on the head with a big hammer until I forget all about this horrible flick."
3,A Doctor Turned Killer,"The style of this book was quite a change from the way Keith Ablow has previously written. Instead of writing fiction, he has chosen to write a bio about Dr. John Kappler. In 1975, Dr. Kappler, an anesthesiologist, secretly attempted to kill a pregnant patient by giving her the wrong anesthetic, deliberately sent a patient into cardiac arrest and with his car, ran down two innocent people. His fellow doctors not only rescued him from jail, but also allowed him to continue practicing medicine. At his trial, Kappler pleaded insanity, claiming he had heard voices telling him to kill people. This is the story of a doctor who became a killer and the medical establishment that looked the other way."
3,Thank you,This is a good book. Not great. It's sad though that someone can be so mentally challenged and get by with such awful deeds.
2,Boring,This did not catch my interest at all. I like Ablow books but not biography type. Surprised at lack of action of the State.
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"This book is another in the current trend of padding a book with lots and lots of trial testimony. While Dr. Kappler's case is interesting and the crime that he was tried for took place within walking distance of my house, there was more trial testimony than anything else, except for maybe the author's praise for his colleague who was killed. Read the first half and skip to the last two pages. Everything else is just filler."
2,This was not the story I expected.,I didn't enjoy this book as much as I expected at all. It was too much focused on psychiatry versus the story which is what I wanted to read. Very well written but not of interest to me as I had hoped.
1,HYPOCRISY,"Keith Ablow is to all intents and purposes a modern day miracle worker, a true good samaritan if ever there was one. The problem is its not the truth.The truth is that he lures victims into confiding their deepest secrets and then he uses it against them.This doctor has a dark side that no one sees.After all, how many victims would a predator get if he presented the wolf behind the mask too soon?I doubt my comment will remain long if at all because he has hired ""consultants"" who clean and polish his web image by getting rid of comments like mine.I don't know when or how long it will take, but it will eventually come out from all of us."
1,Another Rationalization for Flailing (Hack Testing),"This book is unfortunately another example of the ""flailing away"" school of testing. This approach takes testers down the parlous path of defining requirements themselves without regard for what the system is supposed to do. The book is basically a rationalization for lack of planning, lousy requirements updating, and an endorsement for undisplined and unstructured software development. If you want to build and test the Microsoft way, this book is for you. If you want reliable systems, however, choose one of the better books on the subject. By the way, why do publishers publish dribble such as this?"
1,Not for J2EE Testing,"Nice book, however I wouldn't recommend it to anyone testing REAL software. I would recommend it to all Fat Client testers using MS products."
5,The Best Practical Software Testing Book on the Market,"""How to Break Software"" will guide you through the art of breaking more than just software. You will break into the thoughts of how to find amazing bugs in some of the world's most used applications and along the way you will learn how to find amazing bugs in the software you test everyday.The practical knowledge gained by reading this book will have developers listening to your insight the next time you file a bug report."
3,TV Excorcist Good Against Evil,"GOOD AGAINST EVIL: A couple's child is posseseed by the devil. Hardly original this made-for-TV movie at least explored the Excorcist theme when The Exorcist was only available at movie theaters.Now it is a bit of nostalgia. A highlight is Dan O'Hearly playing the priest.At times its kind of funny like when furniture flies at the priest trying to excorcise the demon. It looked like people out of camera range were throwing things away from the priest. Does the Devil have extremely bad aim?Still if you like old '70s horror like I do, you'll enjoy it.SATAN'S SCHOOL FOR GIRLS: This is OK but hardly scary. Kate Jackson plays a witch in a girl's school that isn't quite what it seems. Roy Thinnes also stars. Passable time filler. Definately no SUSPIRIA (although the movie was made before Dario Argento's masterpiece."
3,Ok for price,The item is sort of as described but what they fail to mention is that this is NOT a direct replacement for your original headlights. These are higher wattage bulbs that are likely not DOT approved for road use.
1,COPY of My Scene,"It doesn't matter which is better, but this doll/theme was copied from the My Scene line. Madison has a blue birthday dress on, cut her bangs short, and celebrates Nolee's birthday. This Sasha doll has a purple/blue themed outfit on, cut her bangs short, and celebrates a birthday occasion. All the My Scene Club Birthday dolls have stylish dresses, while all the Bratz Birthday Bash dolls have way too poofy skirts, ugly fishnet pantyhose, and a shirt. I think the My Scene were much more completely made, had an actual occasion to dress the way they did, and sold better than these will. If you want a realistic looking birthday doll, please try the My Scene Club Birthday Madison doll( the first and better birthday doll)."
1,TRUE,"They did copy the my scene ones, and they did it cheaply, too. Sasha looks like she's crossing her eyes, and her bangs are a reck. Get the my scene ones, not their cheap immatations."
4,Not An Ordinary Joe,"I am prejudiced about this book, because the main character, Joe Ottom, was very influential in my life. I give this book a 5 for content. However, there were a few minor flaws in the production so I had to give it an overall 4.I loved Joe Ottom. He was one of several surrogate fathers to me and he prompted to make the decision to become a Christian and I have never looked back. His life was truly full of adventure and his personality was always cheerful and upbeat. He had a great enthusiasm for life which can only come from a true faith in God through Jesus Christ.I believe that believer and nonbeliever alike will enjoy the adventure stories of this man's life contained within the pages of ""Not an Ordinary Joe."""
1,Full of math mistakes,"Be careful with this software! I don't know why these smart people made so many simply math mistakes, you can find errors everywhere on the portfolio and report pages."
4,Yawn!,"1 - No difference that I can find over 2005. Funny thing is that I said this with my 2005 from 2004 version purchase! I guess I will never learn, I'm a sucker for the lastest and greatest Money software. Really, you do not need this if you have 2005, you can live without backing up to CD/DVD.2 - I have not found any bugs. You are thinking, Ya, so? If you were an early adopter of 2005 (the buggiest POS that MS Money put out), you would have seen this a huge achievement also.Summary - nothing really exciting over the previous 2 versions, wait for the free offer with your tax software next year. If you are new to personal finance software, you really need to get this."
2,"Do not buy, before you try it out!","As a long-time Money user I bought Money 2005 Deluxe and had to return it for a refund, because it refused to read my Money 2004 data file.With Money 2006 I'll be smarter and take advantage of the fact that Microsoft offers a 90 day trial version on their website. So before you buy or upgrade, download the trial and check for yourself, if Money 2006 is for you.BTW if you upgrade from a previous version, keep a backup-copy of your old file, because once you convert your file to Money 2006, an older version of Money won't be able to read it. For the same reason, consider parallel installations (and double data-maintenance) of the Money 2006 trial and your older version for a while, until you've determined to upgrade to M2006 or ditch it."
2,Do not believe MS Money 2006,"Reviewed all other reviews re MS money but since I'm Microsoft certified for 8 years and live with their software daily etc... have ignored bad reviews. However after hours of trying to setup online bill pay...and hours on the phone with MS, I have learned that the online bill pay has been disabled and no longer works. This applies to all Money 2006 products. Call before you buy to see what else may be wrong in their advertising*****...MS Money 2006 online bill pay does not work.... save your time and buy something else.....this software sucks................ I must add that they told me they can refund your money hopefully before June but no guarantees....."
2,It keeps wanting to connect to the Internet,"The software is easy to use and interfaces well with my bank. I also like that the home page can be customized to show different views of your accounts - very nice.My only complaint and, ultimately the reason that I won't use the software, is that it wants to connect to the Internet every time I open it. You are able to turn off the preference to connect to the Internet but the program still requires you to enter your .NET username and password when you begin. I also had to select ""Work offline"" each time you opened the program and I became uncomfortable that I would forget one day.I used the product for a week and decided that the risk was too high that I might forget to keep the program offline and have my banking information uploaded to a ""secure"" Microsoft site."
3,Looks a lot like the previous version,"I continue to be very pleased with Microsoft Money and find the Deluxe version is all that you need for personal use. However, the 2006 version does not appear to be a significant upgrade over the 2005 Deluxe version."
1,really bad license,"Did these other users not get the same license agreement I got? How could anyone not mind?The license agreement gives MS an open-ended legal right to make unnamed/unspecified alterations to your software/computer WITHOUT NOTIFICATION.In other words, by clicking ""I Agree"", the end user is agreeing to allow Microsoft to come in and make whatever changes it sees fit - the language specifically refused to limit what MS could and could not do - and you will not be notified when alterations are made to your computer, your software, etc.What sort of crazy person is okay with a deal like this? Doesn't anyone read what they are signing, or what?"
2,Money 2006 is good but..... but becarful with backup,"I WAS so happy using this software until i start planning to change my PC.........The reason why i have gave this product 1 star is the following:1)I backed up all the data and moved my back up files into the new PC and it does restore, but i lost all the transactions under my accounts2) I lost my budget plan3) All i found is (Accounts information ONLY, Bills scheduals)Thats all what MS Money 2006 Delux back up file has, and the backup file is around 3.78mb, looks like something wrong in program restore since i am %100 sure of the backup/restore steps.Please becarful before you start using this program, i consider it a disaster for the user if he would like to format his pc or mirgrate to another pc."
1,Now more forecast in Bills Summary,The greatest feature to previous versions was the ability to highlight items to see where you stood with each bill. No longer! The genius at Microsoft who has more money than Uncle Sam decided common folks do not need a bills forecast.
4,"Um, no problems here...","Folks, I don't know what to say, except my balances transferred fine, my accounts work fine, and Money 2006 seems like 2005 in virtually every respect.Never have I seen more whining regarding software products than by the users of Money and Quicken. By the number of 1- and 2-star ratings these products get on Amazon, one would think (like I did, before my first trial of Money 2005) that these programs hardly function. But function they do, and Money has helped me organize a scattered financial existence into a single place. Where I agree with the other users is in suggesting you go for the trial first -- no harm in that -- but then have reasonable expectations of the program. Its job is to help keep track of your finances, not fold the laundry."
1,Like Money Express from the old version? Don't buy this.,"I had Money 2004, and loved its ""Money Express"" feature. It was the icon in the system tray that displayed your upcoming bills and/or deposits whenever you logged on to the computer. Very handy for letting you know when bills were coming due.I upgraded to Money 2006 Deluxe recently, and found out that Microsoft did away with this feature. Now I'm asking myself why I wasted my money.One usually assumes that when you upgrade to the latest version, you'll get more features, not less. What's that expression about assuming???"
1,I'm sticking with Money 2004,"I have downloaded and used the demo on two separate occasions now (I'm a slow learner I guess). Both times ended in frustration and my reinstallation of Money 2004. The interface isn't nearly as intuitive as 2004. When I set up my mortgage, the ammoratization schedule was completely wrong. The catagories are not nearly as nice or extensive as 2004. I really tried to like Money 2006, but between the bugs and the frustration it is a step backwards from Money 2004. I strongly reccomend trying before buying."
1,Problems updating investment prices,"Microsoft has been experiencing problems updating the prices of most non-US Funds, and these have not been resolved despite lengthy discussions on microsoft newsgroups. At the time of writing, pretty much all non-US Funds are not being recognised by Microsoft Money and are therefore being ascribed a nil value in portfolios. This leads to very misleading results and makes the product of very limited use if you wanted to use it to track your investments and you would do better to look for a different product than this one."
2,Some features expire in 2 years,"Decent interface, nice product overall, if you can stand the in your face advertising they have in the program for 3rd party advertisers. I can't believe I PAID to see spam. The downloads from credit cards are nice, but Microsoft announced that the downloads expire after 2 years. This has been happening since Money 2003. Money 2002 is the only one that doesn't have the credit card / bank statement downloads expire after 2 years. Google Money 2006 (in groups) to get other opinions.Oh, and if you're on the paranoid side, don't use passport. A friend was on tech support at MS and they had him turn on passport and they were able to see all of his account information over the net. I don't know how that works but its a little scary if you ask me."
3,Cloning?,"Have been using MS Money for as long as the software has been around. I migrated from Quicken to MS due to the ease of use and low learning curve. We have often upgraded the software throughout the years; about 4-5 times. This latest version has to be the most encumbersome upgrade of them all. By the time I was finished installing the software, opening the old file, connecting to Money Online, synchronizing the transaction I ended up with some of the accounts having duplicate transactions. Tried several ways to get rid of the duplicates and finally gave up and reverted back to the old version of the software. After three weeks I tried it again on a different machine and ended up with the same result. For all I know it could be me!!!Best approach may be to start fresh or do not choose to connect to internet (for remote access to your financial, a year subscription free with the purchase).Good Luck!"
2,A step backward,"Don't buy this one. It is time to change to Quicken. I have been using Money for almost 5 years now and I am feed up with it. This version fixes nothing, enchances nothing, added more web pages which I don't care about, and expires the download capability in 2 years. When I installed the software half of my existing online setups were broken and I had to resolve the problem myself. (Useless Microsoft support)."
3,Great feature from previous versions removed!!!!,Overall a great product. I have been a Money user for 5+ years however this year they removed a feature in the Bill Summary / Calendar that was a must. It allowed you to hightlight and drag over upcoming bills and forecast cash flow based on the current amount in your checking account. It was an awesome feature. Anyway 2006 no longer has it and Microsoft confirmed to me it was removed.
1,MS should be ashamed,"This is incredibly bad SW. Aside from problems downloading data from banks, the user interface is inexcusable! I never made it past trying to set up accounts (succeeded with some, failed with others, no idea why) and categorize transactions and review charts. I never could get it to download 401K or credit card data. The final straw was all the stupid dialogs that aren't wide enough to see either the whole account description or transaction description and can't be resized. Forget making it to separate budgets for different accounts. Returned for refund."
1,Once again an album full of not-oldies-but-goodies,Blue Suede Shoes may be the only original in this collection. A couple of others may be original but they sound like they were played on a cheap speaker 15 feet from a cheap microphone. Don't waste your money.
5,Healing and Encouaging,"If you are going through a tough time and dealing with anger from past hurts and disappoinments, this book will help carry you through those storms. You will get an understanding of anger and the effects it has on our daily lives. The book has been a blessing many times over and I have recommended it to several friends and family members over the years."
5,OMG....my son doesn't leave home without ti.,"THIS is my son's ""lovie"" He has had it since he was about 3 months old. He sleeps with it every night and he has more than one. In the mornings, he gathers up his ""doggies"" and won't get out of the crib unless he has them all. They get dirty easily but I throw them in the washer machine.Some of the ""barking"" is gone on them but he truly loves his doggie. Super Soft. I highly recommend this product. It is a little pricey but really well-made. My son is 2 1/2 years old now and it's ""A man's best friend."""
5,Super cute puppy,This puppy is such a cute little stuffed buddy for a baby!It makes a cute little room decoration or addition to a baby gift.
3,I wish i knew it barked,My son loved this toy when i got it for him but it didn't last very long because i was afraid to wash it since it has a sound box inside that makes the dog bark.
3,The bark button is difficult to press.,I like the toy except for the barking button which is difficult for the kids to press. I generally wash the toys before giving it to my son. The bark button limits that.
4,"soft and cudly,could be bigger","I just got this puppy for my unborn baby boy. I love that it's soft and looks well made, I'm only giving a 4 star because it's way smaller than I thought it would be."
4,Pretty good RAM,"This RAM kit is pretty good ... The only minor issue I don't like is vdimm. It requires at too much voltage (at least 2.8). If you mobo cannot provide more than 2.8v for vdimm, pretty much you are screw with OCing ..... Anyway, it's good RAM. Highly recommended!"
5,Great Performer,"Easy to hook up and easy to use, even for me - a relative novice.The quality of the scanned images is superb. Absolute value for money. I have had people ask me if my scanned photograph prints sent as jpg files were images from a digital camera."
2,Spend a few dollars more,I had the same problem as another reviewer. The computer stopped recognizing the scanner. Reinstalling the software did not help. Trying it on another computer didn't work either. Up till when this happened I was happy with it. I suggest you spend a few more dollars to get a more up to date scanner.
3,worked great until the glass broke,"I had this scanner for a couple years. I thought it worked really good. I used it mainly for scanning pictures, and they were very sharp. Then one day the glass shattered into hundreds of tiny pieces with no apparent explaination."
5,This Scanner Is A Dream,"After purchasing a different scanner about a year ago for my Win98 system, and never being happy with it, the company's Tech Support and I could not get it to work on my new Win2000 system.So I purchased the N65OU because of the great reviews. When I got it, it installed easily (in minutes), the software was easy to use, and it scans great. Even the OCR software works reliably.It is hard to believe that Cannon could cram so much quality in such a small package, but they did."
4,Very flimsy USB connector,"The Canon CanoScan N650U is a terrific portable scanner, as described in the many reviews here. Be warned, however, that the USB port--where the USB cable is inserted--is extremely flimsy--it's already broken after about 3 months' use. The weight of the cable itself is enough to eventually break the connector (actually, the small circuit board inside the scanner on which the USB connector is mounted has broken loose). I use it a lot and bring it back and forth from work--I suspect this design just can't handle constant use. It clearly needs a redesign."
2,Flimsy connector on the back broke after 3 wks of LIGHT use,"After three weeks my computer no longer recognized that the scanner was there. I called tech support (on my dime :( ) and they sent out another cable - no good. Called again (my dime) and they offered to replace it with another. What good is that if it just breaks again? The connector on the back needs some physical support, so make sure you don't breathe on it heavy or anything really violent like that."
1,Pure Paranoid Drivel,"The inclusion of ""references"" means nothing. This is pure paranoid drivel. Anyone who believes this stuff is in serious need of antipsychotic medication."
4,Pretty good book,I would recommend this book to others. It is basic common sense really that getting more exercise will burn more calories. There's a lot of number figuring in this book which made it kind of confusing. But overall I think it makes a lot of sense to start getting more exercise through walking and increasing your walking gradually.
3,"Good item, as far as I know",This item was given as a gift to a family member who was struggling to lose weight. I don't know how much she used it.
2,"Good walking advice, not very informed diet information","Although I got some really good statistics on walking and how calories are burned and tips on how to increase my steps, I totally disagreed with their discussions on diets. There was very little documentation to back up broad statements on the (in their view) positive use of sweetners and very little information on the choice of using natural foods as opposed to processed foods."
2,disappointed,I was really looking forward to getting this. The first thing I noticed was that the pedometer was broken.The second thing I felt I didn't like was the fact I did not get a hard covered edition. That would have been nicer. That was my fault.
4,It's As Basic As Just Moving Your Feet,"When my book came, the odometer it came with never even worked. Luckily, I took the advice of another reviewer and purchased a much better one at the time of my book purchase. The odometer came in several days after the book but, it was worth the wait.I only needed to lose seven pounds, which I have and keeping it off seemsrather simple. The freedom of not counting calories (the negative) but rather, counting steps and setting positive goals is refreshing. This idea really works formy life."
4,Simple and motivating,"This book is very motivating. I wear a counter (included with the book) to count my steps daily. After several weeks, I've determined that I can commit to achieveing 15,000 steps a day (their minimum is 10,000). This book gives me a good understanding of what it takes to balance food intake with energy burned. I've lost about 10 pounds so far, with 10 more to go."
4,Good book,A very interesting and different way of looking at weight control. 30 pounds in 12 weeks - I guess it works!!!!
4,One Small Step for Man,I lost 8 pounds in 4 weeks following the concepts in this book. I have finally set goals for my weight. I'm walking myself to a better place. Thank you.
4,Good book...tells us what we already know,"I got this book along with my pedometer. The book is not GREAT but basic. It is organized well and I think can be understood by just about anyone. I must say it is the best diet program around...It is no dieting involved...just gradual lifestyle changes: Move more, eat less, drink more water. The End. Gotta love it. :-)"
3,Because *why not*!,"I picked up a copy of this at a church rummage sale two years ago, and it's the best thing a church rummage sale has ever done for me.Anachronistic, awkward (oh, poor virgin templar-man; ohh, poor angry lutenist), historically impossible, and demonstrating a keen fondness for the word ""naught"" (and its misuse), UNICORN VENGEANCE has nonetheless provided me and mine the most fun we have ever had with a romance novel. Maybe it's not the best book--or even the best romance--ever written, but if you approach it with the right attitude, it has more to offer than C.D. probably intended.And, seriously, there is naught but one way to approach a book with a title like UNICORN VENGEANCE. Seriously. So have fun. :)"
2,Entertaining but historically inaccurate,"Clearly Ms. Delacroix didn't do much (okay, any) research about the Templars and not a great deal about France in 1307. She does put in a lot of action, though, and if you like sappy, flowery writing, you won't be able to put this one down. If you are an avid historian, run screaming the other way. (Everybody knows the Templars were assasins, even in 1307!)"
5,Ahhh...The Wonder Years!,"I'm one of those 30-years-old children! These are the songs I grew up with in the Dominican Republic back in the 80's. This is a great CD that I can now share with my daughter, as I remember my happy childhood in paradise. This is a must for any Spanish-speaking family or any 30-year-old child!"
2,An interesting idea but a flawed execution.,"This starts of with a decent main character, not especially likeable but interesting, and a reasonable set of supporting characters and the idea of the war and its fallout is interesting.Unfortunately it gradually goes downhill, the interaction with the family of psychics gets more and more surreal and the gradual introduction of more and more vugs makes no sense.By the end the plot has completely unravelled leaving a silly climax and nothing of any real interest.One of the worst books by Dick I have read."
5,A profound and witty diagnosis and prognosis of modernism.,"Philip Kuberski's remarkable CHAOSMOS weavestogether twentieth-century fiction, physics, andphilosophy Western and Eastern in order toreflect on the exhaustion of modernity and thepossibilities of post-modernity. Hopeful but notsentimental, Prof. Kuberski finds in modern literatureand science not only the self-destruction of theCartesian paradigm, but the emergence of ways ofthinking, feeling, and writing that avoid the stalebinaries of the former: neither chaos nor cosmos,but ""chaosmos.""Insights are to be found on every page. In addition,the book is a terrific read: no wasted words, nowrong notes; in short, a book that is worthy of theextraordinary writers it treats."
5,One of my favorite episodes,"I was just watched Scooby Doo on TV because there really was nothing on, and this episode just shocked me. Usually in Scooby Doo, the kids are just running away without any reason and if the monster catches a kid, the kid gets locked in a room somewhere. The kids have a reason to run in this episode. The monster is actually trying to kill them off! I found this to be very refreshing and kinda disappointed to find out what Scooby Doo could have been. Regardless, this was a fantastic episode. This is all I will say."
3,not really thinner than a normal wallet,"After many years of a back pocket wallet I went looking for a front pocket wallet. I choose this one because the price was right. Once I got this wallet I was dissapointed that the thickness (when folded) was just as thick as a regular tri-fold wallet (maybe 3/4 of an inch), and this just would not work for me in the front pocket. The magnet itself adds alot to the thickness. Otherwise, the quality was good and the return was easy."
4,Magnetic Money Clip,I am very pleased with this money clip. The magnet is very strong and you shouldn't worry about losing it's grip on your money. The leather stiching was very good and the leather quality is also good.
3,Usable but be wary,"This product arrived in fine condition, if a little beat up. The first thing I noticed was that some of the stitching was loose and sloppy. The magnet is very strong and is sure to hold your wad of cash. The wallet is also comfortable in both back and front pockets. The main problem with this wallet is the card pouch; moderately stuffing the pouch can cause it to loosen and bulge out. Basically, anything I would have in the pouch would slip its way out in my pants. This is terribly inconvenient.I recommend this product if you're looking for a starter clip wallet and don't have a lot of cards to carry around. Otherwise, it would be optimal to get something a little sturdier."
5,Great story,This is a wonderful little story. Will be a good choice for all children but especially your fave Dino lover
3,not enough credit,"neal has been around for a long time. and for some reason credit has eluded him. like his new england peers (ronnie earl duke robilard) neals style of playing is a mixxed bag of jump/westcoast, and texas style playing. i would never say that this is his best recorded work but it will certainly give a new listener a taste of what he is about. look for a new live release mid summer, this is the one that should put him without question in that highest of catigories."
3,''THE'' real superb performance by... Zhukov,"When you listen to Igor Zhukov's interpretation of Medtner's First Piano Concerto (with The USSR TV and Radio Large Symphony Orchestra conducted by Alexander Dmitriev -- on Melodiya/Turnabout lp, 1982), pianist Dmitry Alexeev really looks like a schoolboy and his performance sounds superbly... dull!"
5,"A wonderful prequel to ""August Magic!""","After reading ""August Magic,"" the author's first novel, I wanted more! Imagine how exciting it was to learn that the author had written what she calls a ""prequel"" to ""August Magic!"" The story is about an African-born Basenji who comes to live in North Carolina. It's very intriguing to read about the Basenji dogs in Africa, and while the story is fiction, there is still much fact there, too. All in all, a great companion to ""August Magic,"" and a book any Basenji person will thoroughly enjoy."
4,"Durable, and holds big baits!","I have 11 of these boxes that are filled with 4""-18"" musky baits,this box holds them with no problem. They are durable, pretty lightweight, and last a good long time. i personally think they are a little pricy,i mean basically your paying 75-100$ for a molded piece of plastic,that probably costs like 8$ to make, kinda seems like a rip off, that's why i only gave it 4 stars,but overall i think they work perfectly for my use!Mike Farmer"
4,great story but,"I liked this book, but because it is Christian fiction was very disturbed that the n-word was used twice by the author. I have read numerous other Christian authors(LaHaye, Jenkins, Rosenberg, Rivers) and none of them ever used foul language in their writings. His concept of a 3 1/2 year tribulation instead of a 7 year tribulation was interesting. I have already purchased the 2nd book in his trilogy, I just hope that no offensive language is present. Overall the book held my attention, but I won't give it 5 stars because of the 2 uses of an inappropriate word for this genre."
1,"Off the hook is a great number, he needs more of this",Off the hook is great peice of music. It's a shame he does not have more of this kind of music on his album. Over all I rate this a three. Like I said if he had more music I would have rated it higher. I will still buy the album but only for the song Off The Hook
2,A sad reflection on todays 'smooth jazz' scene,"Oh dear... 'Both Sides' starts off confidently enough with a couple of commercially strong 'radio play' tracks (Off The Hook being one), then dies rather quickly with uninspired make-weight fodder - struggling for musical ideas. What a shame that (again) musicians of this calibre compromise their talents for the sake of making a quick commercial buck. Other 'smooth jazz' artists seem to me to be more comfortable with the style, do it far more convincingly, and far more consistently to warrant buying this CD."
3,"""Cool"" jazz, as opposed to ""smooth"" jazz...","This album is very cool. I wouldn't exactly say it's a smooth album however. Most of the tracks are very upbeat and hip, but Roger Smith fails in the same category that many other virtuosos like Steve Vai, Chuck Loeb, and Victor Wooten fail--song writing. There's plenty of talent on this CD, but some of the tracks make you think ""When is this song going to start?"", only to find that 3 minutes have gone by. There is plenty of slap bass on this album for the bass guitar-enthused. All in all, about 5 of the 11 songs were well written. You'll love Roger's rendition of ""Change the World"", and also the dark beauty on tracks like ""Bring It On"" and ""Off the Hook"". All in all, I give it 3 stars because he could have thought about some of these songs just a tad more before putting them on tape."
5,Do you want to understand the Bible?,"Then buy this book! I've had this book (and Jensen's Survey of the Old Testament) for over 15 years. I have used them both to help guide me in my study of dozens of Bible books, and they have been a huge help in my spiritual growth. I love them so much I am now going through the Gospel of John with my teenage boys, using Jensen's book as a guide. Both the boys and I are loving it. In fact, I ordered them each their own copy of Jensen's book to help them start their own Christian libraries.In your study of a Bible book, Jensen will guide you first through an overview of the entire book so you can see the big picture. Then he takes you through several main topics within the book, so you can focus on the details. He also has very insightful ideas for application and further study.I give it my highest recommendation."
3,Pls improve the quality of the scanned charts,"It's a very good material, but the quality of the work put in this ebook isn't worth it. The pictures or charts are very hard to see and I am a nearsighted guy!. Pls improve the graphics of the material and I will give you a good review. Thank you"
3,very beat up,"The book was very beat up and hand a great deal of writing in the book itself. All this was alright though ,I was still able to use it and I knew it was used"
2,Buy the hard copy,"The survey itself is outstanding. It is one of the best for individual bible study. However, the heart of the survey are his charts. They cannot be read in the ebook and there is no way to enlarge them. If you want the charts buy the hard copy. It is hard to navigate there are no shortcuts. Very disappointed in the E version of the book.H Greene"
1,Non working furby,I bought this for my grandson for Halloween. Took it out of the box but could not get it to work at all.My grandson was very disappointed that his limited edition furby did not work!
2,Empty Cup,"How disappointed I was in purchasing this book, especially considering how much I've read about the author. The writing is marginal, relying more on recipes from the tea rooms. The photographs are low quality, and do not typically depict the tea atmosphere as normally presented by the tea rooms. I was expecting ""CLASSY"" and got ""TACKY"". I think the author, Bruce Richardson, uses this book and his other to officiate his own tea room."
4,A very pretty book,"This is a delightful book for browsing and getting inspired. The photos are pretty and the recipes fine. I wish the author would have included a copy of the current menu at the time of publication. This would help in planning a visit to know if one wants to go for lunch, the real teatime or something else. Overall, I love the book and it is througly charming."
2,Spacers Breaking -- Poor Warranty,I was given two of these chairs for a Xmas gift. The white spacers that are part of the frame/supports are cracking and falling out. I called Alps and they offered to replace the chairs if I paid for shipping both ways -- probably $50 in cost. Alps said that the broken spacers don't affect the chair and that this was a known problem with some of these chairs. But I don't know how the spacers falling out can't affect the operation and safety of the chair.
2,seat cover,"when reviewing the item online, it stated there was one cover in the package - there is actually two. I purchased 2 packages thinking I would get 2 seat covers. Instead each package contains 2 seat covers, now I have 4 and only needed 2. The edge color appeared to be alot less brown. The actual color of the edge is brown not tan. The type of fabric should also be stated. I was expecting microfiber as the photo appeared to be but it was not. It was more of a heavy linen type fabric with a diagonal pattern on it that did not show in the picture online."
4,Great find!,The car seats fit well and do not ride up when being used and they match the interior of my car perfectly.
2,Braxton Seat Cover,"Great looking seat covers in my opinion but they don't last! I installed them to protect the leather seats on one my cars (which is not a daily driver) and the driver's side seat cover had a run in the fabric after only four drives! I kid you not, the fabric ran after after less about 150 miles of driving!"
2,Sleeping on the caravan,"This is Putumayo's first ""Odyssey"" album,surprisingly,it is still in print(!) It explores the acoustic side of Middle Eastern music.Unfortunately,it's quite repetitive.""Ya Malaam""&""Zwit Rit"" go on.And on.Khaled,as usual,is great in ""Ki Kounti."" Rasha's ""Leila"" is not THAT bad;it's hypnotic instead of boring.""Nahawand""&""Through the Veil"" are North African jazz.Like some smooth jazz, this album falls into the trap of being repetitive.""Cairo to Casablanca"" ended up being an album I eventually took to a used CD store.Perhaps someone else will enjoy it.I didn't."
3,"Good except for AWFUL ""Rasha""","The first seven selections on this CD are quite enjoyable and atmospheric. Makes me sort of want to get up and belly dance. Then we get to the eighth cut and it is excruciating. This is by an Algerian artist named ""Rasha"" who performs her composition ""Leali."" This is just meandering up and down the scale. All I could think of was Arnold Schoenberg Goes Arabic. It is nerve-wracking. I have managed to sit through that one twice, but I will never do so again by choice. This is so awful that it ruins the whole CD. The remaining three selections are probably not bad, but listening to Rasha just puts me in such a bad mood that it's difficult to listen to the rest of the CD. After Rasha, I'm just ready for this CD to be over. If I were technical minded enough to figure out how to program my player to skip Rasha I might like this CD. But as it stands now, I don't think I'll be listening to this one again within the next few years."
3,For the curious,"Even for Putumayo fans, I think many will find this album more of an interesting curiosity rather than necessarily enjoyable. I enjoyed listening to it the first time but for me I don't think it will stand up in repeated listenings."
4,Enchanting,"""Cairo to Casablanca"" offers the listener a mix of Middle Eastern tunes. Listen to it when you're driving :)"
4,Some Songs Very Good and Some Bad,"When you have a compilation like this, you are sure to like many of the songs and skip over others. Good for long drives or background music when entertaining."
1,Are we sleeping yet?,It is often said the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I am sure the editors of this disc had good intentions but fell so far short of the mark it isn't funny. Don't waster your time with this pedestrian collection of tunes.
4,Compelling collection for the first time listener,"I'm far from being an expert in North African music, but 4-5 songs on this CD are truly excellent. I've listened to the CD about 15 times and still haven't tired of it. So far all the Putamayo collections I have are excellent. I even like the cover art and liner notes. It's nice to see that they took the time to write out explanations of all the songs and a bit of background about the artists. These discs are good learning tools to get enough information about these artists to appreciate music from various different cultures."
5,A mystery in post-World War 2 New Orleans,"I just finished ""Dinner at Antoines's"" by Frances Parkinson Keyes and found it to be a deeply satisfying mystery with a romantic subplot. The descriptions of post-war America and New Orleans were beautifully and thoughtfully written. I have read many Agatha Christie and Ngaio Marsh mysteries and even though this novel is not presented in exactly the same way as their writings, the elements of mystery were still very much uppermost within the story. There was a low-key, thoughtful sleuth in Captain Theophile ""Toe"" Murphy, a cast of colorful characters who in one way or another had a motive for murder and the backdrop of Carnival balls and customs of New Orleans, mainly as seen from the eyes of visitor Ruth Avery, a Senator's step-daughter in Washington, D.C. I didn't know who the killer was until the end of the book. The epilogue narrative sufficiently rounded out the story. Excellent recreational reading."
4,Hollywood Worldviews,"Hollywood Worldviews is a very thoughtful, intelligent and challenging approach to film criticism and film understanding for all those interested in engaging the Arts and Pop Culture through a Bliblical Worldview.I found myself thoroughly engaged and interested in everything he had to say. The author's comprehensive use of examples, His emphasis on ""storytelling"" and the ideas of ""redemption"" as a key component to every film is a must read.If you are as much a lover of film as I am, you will want to pick this up and begin using this book as great source of reference from general conversations to more academic points of discussions."
5,Solid System!,"The compressor is well engineered, sturdy but easy to move around. The brad nailer and stapler are solid and perform well consistently. I'd choose this setup again. Recommended."
3,A little miscommunication,"I loved VOD....I grew up 2 miles from them.....saw them every show in tri-state area from I guess '92 - '98.....and then their reunion shows.When I heard they were coming out with a DVD, I assumed(perhaps wrongly) that it would have some old footage from shows past. Nope...this is one show (edited horribly I might add) from the reunion tour.While it is waaaaay worth the $10.00......I was hoping for some more....a little too much I guess."
4,still droppin' . . .,"VOD had announced a dvd 2 years ago, when they played the reunion shows that are captured on this disc. But with no word coming from the band for quite some time, imagine my surprise when I found out that the dvd was released.I'd recommend this for any fan of the band- old or new. The camera works a little shaky at times and it is a little dark, but who cares? it's VOD live! The band's tight and Tim doesn't miss. All the hallmarks of a classic VOD show are here- circle pits, pile-ons, and plenty of bashed and bruised fans at night's end. There is some extra material- a short but entertaining ""History of VOD"" feature and two features on the locations of the '06 reunion shows. I would've liked to have seen something on VOD's appearance at Superbowl of Hardcore, which predated the Long Island and Worcester shows by a few months."
4,Imprinted,"The long awaited DVD has finally arrived, and was well worth the wait.This is a nicely produced DVD with great menus. This DVD includes extras, behind the scenes for the two shows played as well as some history behind the band. Sound quality and production work is top notch and sounds great, but don't expect Dolby Digital 5.1.Like any other VOD show, this show is excellent and has a lot of energy, and really makes me feel like I was there. While there are about 15 tracks on here to keep you going, no hints of the From Bliss release. It would've been nice to see Itchin' to Bleed and Regurgitate added, but everything else was covered.If you've never been to a VOD show, this is your last chance to capture the feeling and energy their shows provide. If you've been to a show, you know how good it is and this is a way to keep the memories.It's just too bad it wasn't released as a CD also, as this would've be perfect addition to their discography."
2,Less Than Par,"Where was the substance? I didn't grow attached to the characters, and the technology they used wasn't presented in a credible way; this was a major problem considering the nature of military techno thrillers. The author had some interesting ideas, but the novel written around them felt too forced."
3,Now we have Steath Soldiers,"First there were stories of the F117. Then James Cobb wrote of a stealth cruiser. Now Rovin writes about soldiers wearing special suits that make them virtually invisible. Good concept for a techo thriller. I thought the author got a little carried away with the attack on the White House and President. The ""bad guys"", once again, are concerned that the current administration is leaning toward peace and not prepared for war. Reader is left with the feeling that there will be more books to follow. A good read for an airplane, as you don't have to concentrate on the book."
3,Decent,"Unfortunately, most tracks on this album leave something to be desired. The ones that stand out above the rest are track 2: Midnight at the End by Koxbox (wish it was longer), track 4: Sonic Feet by Metal Spark, and without a doubt, track 6: Jardin de Cecile (remix) by Juno Reactor. Juno's original version of Jardin de Cecile was very nice, and so is the remix. The rest however, are pretty weak. It is apparent that the creators of these tracks tried to evolve them, but for some, it is just too little, and it arrives too late. You should probably save your money for a better album."
3,Vietnam Special Ops Upclose,When you read this book you can almost smell the cordite and feel the tension. The author knows how to tell a story. Entertaining and somewhat sad in that a lot of the guys don't come back from patrols in the deepest incursions into enemy territory. I rated the book 3 stars because I expected more than just the SOG stories. An overall good book and will likely read it again.
5,Unsung Heros,"The SOG teams operated in the worst places, and were successful - but at a ""large price in human lives."" Some teams just disappeared never to be heard again; but their faces are still clear in my mind. Heaven has a ""special place"" for the SOG Teams."
4,Personal Review,"I have read Plaster's book ""SOG: The Secret Wars of America's Commandos in Vietnam"" before this book. This particular book leans more towards the author's beginnings in SOG and his personal experiences compared to the other book which concentrates more on the exploits of SOG operators."
5,U.S. Army Special Forces and SOG Recon men; this is REAL!,"As a 22 month veteran of SOG recon teams (11 months at CCS and 11 at CCC) plus going through Special Forces Training Group (Weapons Course) a few months after the author ( Summer- 1968), I can HONESTLY and OBJECTIVELY state that John Plaster has indeed captured the experiences of Special Forces/SOG men in training and at war!A few follow-up comments: I am a Charter Member of the Special Operations Association and since SOA's creation in 1977, I have served and/or associated with most of our living SOG veterans and to a man, they will concur with my above statement because this book is REAL!Those that did less in the Vietnam War and by choice, may disagree but who really cares ? Those of us who are REAL SOG vets sure don't and neither should you! Again, a RIVETING and HONEST account of SOG men at war!"
5,Secret Commandos : Behind Enemy Lines with the Elite Warrior,"By the time I was out of high school the Vietnam War was over and at the time, being a snot-nosed teenager, I considered myself lucky not having had the chance to go. After reading this book I understand the extreme danger these BRAVE men were exposed to and how they served the USA with honor. I could not put the book down trying to imagine myself in their place, which was hard to do with my kushy, easy-road-to-hoe life (and I have a vivid imagination). Whether you served your country or not - this is a must read!"
4,Few have been there and done that...........Plaster has!,"The mission performed by the author and his fellow members of SOG have got to be some of the most dangerous performed by ANY members of the military in VietNam. His writing addresses the day to day issues of planning and running covert missions into Laos during the war, and the problems encountered, with the enemy, the weather, and the support network. The author included great detail and did not attempt to paint himself as a hero.Two thumbs up!"
1,"88 Reasons, 23 years later","I came to the page while researching a blog post (southernmanblog.com) on the May 21, 2011 rapture. When ""88 Reasons"" came out I was a first-year professor at a small, fundamentalist, profoundly conservative, Bible-thumping college. Not one professor or administrator there believed a word of this book, and the main effect was that we were all called into a meeting and given pointers by one of the psychology profs on how to effectively work with concerned students and parents. And one of the physics profs teamed with a religion prof and did a panel discussion in which they fairly convincingly dismantled most of the author's arguments from both scientific and Biblical views. Good times!"
3,This book frightened me as a child.,"When I was around 7, my parents had this book. It sat on the coffee table, scaring the bejesus out of me. I had forgotten about it, but thanks for the reminder of why I have generalized anxiety disorder."
