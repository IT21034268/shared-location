4,After the first chapter it's great,"I wish I could say that I enjoyed this book from beginning to end, but that would be a lie. The first chapter of this book stunk. Not like P.U. but like holy cow roasting in the sun after it has been dead for a week. Yeah...really it was that bad. The first chapter was boring, and I told myself to read on a little further and see if it got better. It did, thankfully. The rest of this book was interesting and fun and sometimes just outright hilarious. I liked that the characters were zany and crazy and not what you usually find in the average novel. The plot was funny and you can't go wrong when you add a chupacabra to an already twisted tale. This book is part crime novel, part mythical beast hunter and part...Eh?? enough so that in the end it becomes amazing that the author managed to make it all tidy up into a neat little package. It would have been five stars were it not for that terrible attempt at a first chapter."
5,Blanco County is where i want to move to!,Ben Rehder's charachters are so relatable I want to move to Blanco County! Ben is a GREAT writer - you won't be disappointed in the series.
5,The truth lies within,"For me, this book is about being whole in yourself. The search for the missing piece is ultimately successful, but not necessarily because the piece fits. I really can't seem to find the words to say what I want to, so I'll just say ""Read the book."""
4,Delightful Fable,"A stunningly simple but poignant fable for adults and children, teaching the joy of independence and partnership in all our relations in a way that enlightens without preaching."
1,Save your money,"My students love many of the books Mr. Silverstien has written, but please check this one out at the library first. Draw a side view smile on your white board. There you have the book.A Third grade teacher. protzman@shinbiro.com"
5,The Missing Piece,"One of the best books I've found to remind people, young and old, that they have to be their own piece long before they can be anyone else's! Happiness comes from the inside, and Mr. Silverstein demonstrates that elegantly and precisely in this beautiful life lesson, disguised as a children's book. A must-have for readers of all ages!"
5,Simple yet so meaningful,"Shel Silverstein can say more with a few words and a few lines than someone with all of the vocabulary and artistic mediums of the universe. This simple book carries a beautiful message about the search for fullfillment. Don't let the label of ""children's book"" turn you away... The Missing Piece and it's sequel The Missing Piece Meets The Big O are brilliant books dealing with this journey we call life. Enchanting and moving."
5,bought this for my daughter,I bought this with the Missing piece meet the big O Just in case my daughter needs to be reminded of how perfect she already is.
2,Book too old for todays modern pistols,"This book was printed nearly 40 years ago. Nothing on repairing pistols, mostly about hunting rifles. Waste of money. I should have spent more on a new or latest edition of a Gun Repair guide or book. Rated C-"
2,Partially-Filled Capsules,This is a premium-priced product due in part its vegetable-base capsules (instead of gelatin created from discarded meat by-products). I have used about 3/4's of the 250-capsule supply and have no issues except that I've found that a significant percentage of the capsules - maybe 15% - are only partially filled. I'm not saying that they're empty but I'd estimate the fill on that 15% as about 75%. This raises an overall quality control question for me and I'll be looking for a brand other than Solgar next time.
1,this album is not good at all!!,"the song ""she makes me feel"" shouldn't be in this album because is the only good song out of 20 selections. this is my own opion so pls don't get mad or hate me or something whatever!!!"
2,Great Game,This game shuts my pc down. I loved the game but it was causing problems and I had to remove from my machine.
5,GREAT GIFT,GREAT MY SON LOVED IT HUNTING IS HIS HOBBY. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE THAT LOVES HUNTING GAMES. GREAT GIFT.
3,"All the games are pretty much the same from state to state, not much different.","It's pretty good. It's not exactly what I was expecting, but it will do. I really like these ones that have a range to shoot weapons from before the hunt. The tower games are better than the stalking to me, because I like to shoot."
4,Works on Windows 7,"Pretty good for the money. It works on Windows 7, and many of my old games do not. Therefore, I do not have much of a complaint."
3,The best MK video I've seen so far,"Of the two Maison Ikkoku videos I have seen I seem to like this one better. While I'm currently enjoying the first graphic novel, my experience with the videos suggests that they simply aren't as funny or as entertaining as the comic book. My theory is that they are trying to make it into a soap opera for preteen girls, instead of the slightly more respectable (but in my opinion more entertaining)""romantic comedy"" format. This two episode collection revolves around college related stress(saying more might spoil it for some). In my opinion this volume has a fairly generous dose of endearing humor and serves as good introduction to the series. Might I suggest the trade paperback for people who like this video?"
4,instructions,"I love reading instruction booklets. I know many people look at them and groan, but the way the words are laid out, plus the black print over a white background, it's a wonderful sight to behold. Just a wonderful helpful reading experience.This DVD contains ""artful"" fun for rainy night humans. I don't get the sugar flower part, but before I fall asleep tonight I'll pop the DVD in and see if I can find it. It's there somewhere. I just gotta look."
3,"They're as cute as they want to be, but...","These earrings are cute and they look pretty much as they are pictured. The only problem that I have with them, is that the wire part of the earrings--you know the part that drops into your lobe? One of the wires is about a quarter longer than the other one. Making one of the earrings somewhat longer than the other one.I don't know if this was some kind of manufacturing glitch or what? But it is very apparent to me.Because they are fairly casual looking, I won't really worry about returning them. I just wish that the people who are in charge of sending their products out, would inspect them to the point where something like this doesn't happen.In the end, it makes me nervous about ordering from this company in the future."
2,Water dancers,"Ordered two for my grandchildren and both Dolls broke in half the first day, Had to glue them back together. I had bought one a couple of years ago and it never broke."
2,Not So Fun,"The storyline starts out fairly well, and the graphics are great. The voice acting is a bit on the fake side. However, aside from the nice visuals, the battle system is very unstable. I usually don't die within the first six hours of a video game, but in Dragoneer's Aria, I had already died 12 times within the first three hours. The random battles are just that--random about what you'll actually encounter. During one battle, you may come away without a scratch. The next might be so hard that it wipes out your entire party--and this in dungeons that you've already beaten. All in all, it doesn't make for smooth gameplay when you have to keep reloading old data to try again...and again...and again...e.t.c."
1,Horrendously out of date,Don't waste your money unless this publication is finally updated. You can get all the info free on-line anyway. It was great though when it was current for about 5 minutes.
2,Buy the non-dramatized version instead!,"Listening to the Bible in Alexander Scourby's wonderful voice is pure pleasure. Unfortunately, for the ""dramatized"" version, they gave all quotations--entire chapters in some places--to actors of mediocre skills. They sound like they didn't read the script ahead of time. Voice inflection is all wrong. It's an effort to make sense of what one hears. My advice: buy the Alexander Scourby version that doesn't say ""dramatized"" instead."
4,"Not an heirloom item, but it does the job.","There are a few pieces that came a bit wonky, but it all went together and it looks great. It didn't work well sitting in a carpeted corner until I screwed it to the wall. Then it did exactly what we required of it... and it even matched our other ""espresso"" items purchased elsewhere. Don't expect *too* much and this will make you plenty happy."
4,"Easy to assemble, simple and a great buy","Arrived on time. Was assembled in under 20 minutes. The color is lighter than what appears in the picture, so becareful. It fits perfect in a corner of our living room. Looks great. Its very simple but adds a unique touch to any room. It is a great buy for the price we paid. Satisfied!!"
5,"Solid wood, well constructed and good looking","Shipment was super fast, and this corner bookshelf arrived without a scratch on it. It went together in 15 minutes--all hardware was supplied (except the screwdriver) and was good quality. The shelves and rails are solid wood, well stained--not particle board. It's sturdy. Doesn't hold a large amount of stuff, obviously, given the dimensions and the fact that it is pyramid-shaped, but for a small corner it does the trick."
4,Assault Attack/Rock Will Never Die,"This is an excellent album & I was very pleased With it. If you like MSG this is an awesome value. Some of the live cuts are a little fast, (drummer's fault) but it still kicks [booty]!"
5,Emerald nuts,"I discovered these pecans in the grocery store and became addicted to them at that time. I mix them with dried fruit pieces and put them on salads or over hot oatmeal cereal or just for snacking. Then they disappeared from shelves and I was heartbroken. Google led me to them at Amazon and I was able to order more, I hope they contnue to be available! I do plan to try some of the other flavors but I'm very high on the pecans."
1,The missing Pecans,"Emerald Nuts Glazed Pecans, Pecan Pie, 5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)Very dissappointing. They should refer to these as Pecan slices or pieces and not Pecans. In a bag I found only a few pecan halves. Slighly stale as well. Can not recommend."
1,Scottish Pub Band Poor CD,"Clouds were a Scottish Pub band that came down to London around1966 in search of a recording deal. They were decent musicianslive, but poor song writers. This CD is their first and lastalbums packaged together. Both of these albums are pretty shaky.I would NOT recommend them. Some of the reviews offered here arecompletely laughable. Trying to make Clouds out to be some sortof great band. They are obviously submitted by relatives andformer employees. Hey I saw Clouds three times and they were justan enjoyable Scottish Pub band PERIOD!"
4,Missing Genius..,"David Bowie, interviewed in Mojo magazine (1994), described Clouds(formerly 1-2-3)and in particular, Ritchie the keyboard player, as 'genius' material - and one can only rue the fact that this group did not record more albums, for what we have here on these records are tantalising glimpses of brilliance without the meat on the bones. In my opinion, the songwriting and the musicianship shows signs of inherent greatness that is nevertheless obscured by lack of direction and certainty in the recording production/arrangement. If I was to guess further, I would say that these songs do not represent the true worth of the writer, nor does the playing represent the true worth of the group. They needed more time to produce, two more albums perhaps, and we would have had something to rival any other artist (and I DO include 'The Beatles'!).An opportunity lost, and genius unfulfilled."
5,Question.,"I like this record - not in any wild way, just pleasant,I think. I like the second part more than the first. But surely guitars would have sounded even better?"
2,"How about ""No Rotten Revisionism""","I agree with the review below. You have to know something about the punk scene of the 70's, otherwise Lydon will con you. It's mostly damage-control.For example, in the book Lydon laughs at the Clash for ""starting off so mad"" at their gigs that they got knackered halfway through. ""We were smart enough to pace ourselves,"" he claims.The truth is, the Clash stole a lot of the Pistols' audience because of their superior speed and energy. They played with such fury they made the Pistols look like a buncha hippie folk singers. It wasn't a matter of being smart; Lydon's band just wasn't as strong.That's just one instance. The rest of it will be irritating to the British reader because it's very anti-British, and meretricously American-friendly. Lydon squirms his way out of the debate on where punk originated--London or the States. Odd for such a proponent of candor and self-expression.Buy it for a cheap laugh only if you've got the real scoop already."
4,truth? who cares,"i read it a while ago, so i don't remember it that well, but i enjoyed it very much. especially references to HAWKWIND"
2,Sad reading!,I am sorry to say that this book was a major disappointment. I think it has no focus and deals with too many petty things ...and that's too bad.
4,Not Really Rotten at All,"Enjoyed reading John Lydon's book, always thought that the band was mismanaged - what a shame. John is a very interesting character who is outspoken with his views. I like that he never really has forgotten that he came from a working class family and environment. I cannot believe the mistakes made by the manager, this band had more to say and came along at the perfect time in rock history."
4,Great History Lesson,"If you want to learn the real story of punk rock and the Sex Pistols, read this book. This is not written in traditional format, but includes chapters written by different people (Paul Cook, Steve Jones, John's wife and even his dad among others) talking about their experiences with Johnny and/or the Sex Pistols. John's sarcasm and humor make this a great read. This is a very informative book which begins with John's childhood and goes up to PiL and his court battle with Malcom McClaren. Highly recommended!"
3,Confusing at times,"It is incomprehensible that a review book that simply summarizes other books, that changes so very little of its material every year, can have SO many mistakes. How about you pay the same for someone to actually READ the book before you publish it? There was a similarly long errata pdf last year for the 2011, so either they're not correcting old errors or they're managing to screw up whole new things. Who is editing these things? I mean, it's pretty much the same exact book every year!I found these 2 to be much better resources:http://www.amazon.com/Practice-Clinical-Echocardiography-Enhanced-Features/dp/1437727654/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid;=1344539732&sr;=8-5&keywords;=Echocardiographyhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TH4A5G"
3,should be much better quality for such serious text book,"This book has a lot of mistakes and very bad quality of cine loops,specially in chapters that demonstrate wall motion abnormalities and stress test. Also this DVD does not allow to enlarge icons with cine loops that are very small. The quality of DVD in the same book 6 edition is much,much better and more conveniently organized."
4,Echocardiography by H Feiburgein,The book I did purchase is just 5 th edition.But it explains well to understand the principle & practice of echocardiography.I imagine the latest edition will be very brilliant.
4,Very Good book on all aspects of Echocardiography,"If you are looking for a good overall book on all aspects of Echocardiography this is a good book at a fair price. This book, however, is geared toward the echocardiographic professional and would be very difficult for the layman to comprehend."
3,good concept,"the concept of support in- built in the brief is a good one, but I don't find it as comfortable and practical as the belt only. But this is my opinion only."
2,unsatisfied,"The sizing chart for this product is completely off!!! We ordered the large as this would have been the correct size according to the size chart. However, the large is really about a small/med!!!! So needless to say we could not use this product at all. And since we opened the package we were unable to return or exchange it. We are comnpletely disatisfied with this product."
2,wrong sixing,I ordered a 32-24 which the item was marked but it measured 28-30. The replacment turned out to be the same.
1,Not too happy with this purchase,"I recently started to get back into Trower after unearthing my old vinyl collection and thought it would be great to get the old albums on CD. (I put all of my CDs on my iPod.) I thought something was amiss when I began listening to this CD. That's mainly because I bought this to get ""Victims of the Fury"", only to find that this CD does not include all of the old cuts. ""The Shout"" and ""Ready for the Taking"" are missing. The cuts are also out of order from the old vinyl and mixed in with ""Caravan to Midnight"" songs. I have ""Bridge of Sighs"" on CD which is complete and true to the old LP, except that the recording quality is better. I'm not sure about the sound quality on this one yet, but I am definitely disappointed."
3,Caravan to Midnight/Victims of the Fury,"A two album CD one disc that is vintage Robin Trower. Both of these albums made the Billboard top 40 & deservedly so. Are they his best albums? No, but you do get a very good representation here of what Trower was about at this stage. Both albums are similar to each other so it's easy to speak of them together as they are presented here.Outstanding songs include ""My Love (Burning Love)"" which should have been a hit for him; there's also ""Caravan to Midnight"", an instrumental which leaves the impression of the title, ""King of the Dance"" a foot tapper & ""Victims of the Fury"".The sound is excellent released on a British label licensed by Capitol Records. It's an import & priced a little high but well worth the investment."
4,Yes and no,"It's hard to review a double album like this. ""Victims"" is among my most treasured recordings. I think ""Caravan"" is a so-so Robin Trower, which is to say, it's very good. But to my taste, the cuts from ""Victim"" are generally far superior. But, then again, it's a matter of taste. Someone else might have a completely opposite opinion. All I can say is that Robin's stuff is all good, so you can't go wrong.I thought the collaboration of Robin's magical guitar licks combined with his reunion with songwriter Keith Reid from his old Procol Harum days made ""Victims"" very special, rivaling even the classic ""Bridge of Sighs."" But you can't go wrong buying anything Trower has recorded, with the possible exception of ""Someday Blues."" This is a nice recording, but pretty much straight blues that's been done as well by other artists. Trower Power reigns supreme when he plays his unique brand of powerhouse Blues/Rock."
4,Something you should know,"While this collection of Trower/Dewar works is worth having, I doubt there is good reason for the omission of ""Ready for the Taking"" from the original ""Victims of the Fury"" LP.Perhaps this omission can be explained as a routine difference in releases for European and American markets. If so, then the record company executives didn't anticipate US sales. If space on the CD was not sufficient (and I doubt this), deleting ""Mad House,"" ""Jack and Jill,"" or ""None But the Brave"" would have made more sense (at the risk, I realize, of disappointing others).The purpose of my less-than-five-star rating is not to vote against Trower; rather, it is a sign of my disappointment with the track-selection process."
3,A Bit of a Disappointment,"I buy Robin Trower CDs to hear his brilliant guitar solos. As far as that goes this 2 album CD is a bit of a disappointment. Of the 19 songs on this CD only 3 songs - Caravan To Midnight, I'm Out To Get You and Lost In Love - have solos that you can sink your teeth into. It's too bad because many of these songs have great rocker melodies that beg for solos and sound incomplete without them. Good songs that would be great with great Robin solos. If you don't mind not having a lot of solos this is a good one."
4,Not their best......but still a good double,"This package has the last two albums recorded by the band with the wonderful James Dewar on vocals. The first, Caravan to Midnight I found disappointing. The album represented a change in direction and in my opinion not for the better. Robin Trower admitted to spending more time on musical arrangements than previously and although the guitar work is still excellent, the funkier sound leaves me a bit cold. Victims of the Fury is a welcome return to the more familiar power trio line-up (Rustee Allen played bass on Caravan to Midnight and In City Dreams), and has Robin back to his raw sounding best. I rate this as the band's best since For Earth Below."
5,Robin Trower at his best!!,"Robin Trower has a lot of albums, This is one of his best.A great mixture of rock and soul... well worth the money!!"
1,Would have preferred a legitimate publisher,"It's great to reprint classics, but this ""book"" seems to have been ""published"" by a 10-year-old working from his bedroom in Kentucky. Not only is there no typesetting to speak of in this volume (it appears that public domain copy was simply poured into a Word doc), but there isn't a single YEAR mentioned anywhere in this book, aside from the reference to being ""Made in the USA in 2012."" The original date of Bergson's publication isn't mentioned (1911), the year that he revised it isn't mentioned, the translator's note isn't dated--in all, a completely bizarre manifestation. Save your money and read this essay on the internet. It's free. You can even print out what you find online and read it that way. You won't be doing anything different than what the manufacturer of this ""book"" has done."
4,Great Research Effort,"John Chilton has written the most comprehensive volume about the Jenkins' Orphanage Bands to date. He labored for a decade researching this band, of which many important early jazz musicians were members (Jabbo Smith, Cat Anderson, Freddie Green, and Tommy Benford). If you're into South Carolina history, African American history, or the early development of jazz, this book is fascinating and straight forward. It's by no means a novel, and does not use flowery language. If this comes up for sale, check it out!"
2,"Great first few books, then it all goes downhill","When I finished the first book, I wanted more. The art was really unique, it almost seemed to have a CLAMP-like touch. Not only was the art good, but the story was a cute, magical story (which I like), and the characters were great as well. This pattern followed up to about book 5. You can tell that the author was doing a rush job. The animation just went downhill, and things that should have taken about 5 pages took a whole book to complete. The humor starts out great, but as you go on, it just seems to get drier, but I can't complain since it's rated T. It's not horrid, but I wouldn't reccommend it. I got up to volume 8, then I just started reading it in the store."
5,AWESOME!!,"This book was one of the best manga's I have ever read! Between the blood thirsty, cute fuzzy kitten, and Ishtar's ever so spoiled behavior, the laughs never end! I'd recommend this for anyone!"
5,"Who doesn't like cats, vampires, & attractive protagonists?","No one I know, that's for sure. This is manga at its finest. The story has everything it should have: a wacky, humorous edge overlying a more serious and complex plot. The world's history is slowly being realized in this volume, and the characters are already showing glimpses of depth and genuineness. Those who love paranormal fiction/romance, gothic stuff, and urban fantasy will find pure bliss in this volume. And, of course, the stunning artwork is simply icing on the cake. Even if you didn't read a word, you'd be happy looking at the pictures. (Trust me, though--you'll be even happier if you do read it)."
3,Tabs,"Very, very small! My fault, should have looked closer. About .5"" x 3/4"" maybe. But, plenty of them. Thank you."
5,Love this artist,The decorative painters know this artist she has a whimsical style and great imagination.Don't have six more words to write
5,Clay Blair. Hitlers U-Boat War: The Hunted 1942-45,"This book is an absolute must for anyone with a serious interest in the Battle of the Atlantic of the Second World War. Clay Blair, a former submariner in the US Navy, has spent many years both researching and collating information from the belligerents with a unique and fascinating conclusion - that at no time during the Second World War was Britain at serious risk from starvation or defeat - contrary to established beliefs. This book, along with its predecessor 'Hitlers U-Boat War: The Hunters 1939-42', is completely invaluable for both scholars and naval historians. I have referred to it continuously for purposes of my own research."
5,great war document on the uboats,"Having read dozens of world war era books, I would rate this aneasy 5 star and a tribute to the author who has written honestunbiased detailed books on the submarine wars. For anyone whopicks up these volumes the dedication is obvious. I would also recommendhis book on the pacific submarine war and the earlier book the hunters."
2,Much worse than the first volume due to fixation with sinkings,Authors fetish about describing each and every U-boat sinking in the second half of the war dooms this half of the two part series to a near waste of typeface. If you devide the number of U boats sunk by the number of interesting new ways to sink them the problem is obvious. Till 1942 few U-boat sinkings lots of interesting ideas. After 1942 500 sinkings from about three new ideas.A much smaller work would have covered the really important points of both books. Where was the editor.
4,Maybe Better Later,"I ordered this for my five month old daughter and I want to say that she isn't impressed, however, she may just be too young so I'll give her more time. She seems to enjoy them for a few minutes then it's off to something else (but that's most babies, right?). I like them because they're unique, durable and easy to clean. I'll keep them around for later. I would recommend them."
5,"Random looking toy, but my daughter loves it","I got this multiple pack of toys so that I could keep a couple for my daughter and use a couple as shower gift decorations. One of them in particular sounds like a cat toy, but my daughter loves it. Glad that I was able to get 4 in a box... made it way more cost effective than if I would have had to buy separate toys."
4,"Good toys, but you don't need all four","Each of these toys has one side made out of clear plastic and an object on the inside that rattles around. The teether-handles are textured so babies like to chew on them.These are good toys, but I would split them up with another mom. I don't think my daughter likes having four slightly different toys more than just having one or two. I have noticed that she likes the two noisier ones the best (the one with the purple teether and the one with the yellow teether). At about 6 months old she would shake those for a very long time. The other two toys only elicit about 1-2 minutes of play at best and sometimes she just throws them back at me.I recommend these toys for babies 4-6 months. My daughter still plays with them a little at 9 months but much less."
4,"Okay, but not the funnest",My 12 month old kind of likes these toys. I thought they would be more entertaining than he thinks they are. I still think they're a great invention and they're durable and great colors. I would still recommend them even though my son doesn't particularly love them. Just a baby's preference.
1,Poor customer service,"When I ordered the maternity support belt to relieve my back pain, DocOrtho sent me a different size than what I had ordered. Then, when I found the energy to get around to returning the belt, they refused to give me a refund. Worse, the customer service staff were unapologetic and snide. This was the last things I needed in my 38th week of pregnancy. When I worked in customer service I was taught that ""The customer is always right"". DocOrtho apparently teaches their employees that ""It is always the customer's fault"". I will definitely never buy anything from DocOrtho again. Luckily there are lots of other, hopefully friendlier, options for places to buy these support belts."
4,Good support,"I love this belt! I am a dental assistant with back and hip issues. Everyday I have to lean and bed over people and this belt has been great! The only thing I do not like about it is, being pregnant you have to pee alot and you must undo the belt to use the bathroom. But, at then end of the day it is worth it. My baby dosen't seem to like it very much, he trys to push and kick it off if its too tight."
4,Works good,"I was pregnant with triplets when I purchased this back brace and it definitely helped out with the back pain I was experiencing. I was able to work until 28 weeks, and I know it's because I was wearing this. It is quite bulky, but it stays in place and is very supportive. It's awkward to first use, but once you figure out where your comfortable spot is, it's great."
2,Great For Young People!,"I'm a little too old for glitzy, sparkly lotions. I was expecting more of a shimmer than sparkles. Shimmer makes my skin look alive and sparkles make me look silly! I'm passing it on to my Granddaughter."
4,Body lotion shimmer gold:,"Flexs of glitter are large, about half the size of craft glitter. I was looking for a shimmer effect not big glitters stuck on my face."
4,a flute and sax virtuoso,"A few years after Moody got famous by playing his solo on ""I'm In the Mood for Love,"" we find the soxophonist playing his own brand of bebop and hard bop both on the sax and on the flute. He picked up the flute after being encouraged from some flautist friends, including Yusef Lateef. To this day, Moody still does not consider himself a flute player - he thinks of himself as a ""flute holder.""Moody's Mood For Love is a fine album with a good collection of tempos and instruments. Moody sounds equally fluent on both the tenor sax and the flute. Vocalist Eddie Jefferson appears on a couple of tracks, once to sing the famous ""Moody's Mood"" in his own peculiar style. A solid addition to your collection."
4,Under-rated guitarist,"I first picked this album up back in 1985 and was blown away by this guy named Michael Schenker. I recently picked up the CD of this album, and it brought back fond memories of rock back in the early 80's. This album does a good job displaying the amazing talents of Michael Shenker on numerous tracks (Captain Nemo, Systems Failing, and Dogs of War). It is too bad that for someone of his talent, he has been overlooked for so long. If you are looking for some rockin music, I would highly recommend this album."
3,Good cd from msg but could have been better,"This is good cd from MSG but could have been better if were produce better in some parts. Songs I linke best are Rock my nights away, time waits for no one, I'm gonna make you mine. There's lots of great guitar soloing in the cd sometimes like systems failing the song is built around the excellent guitar solo in middle of the song. I don't if the other cd import with the different versions of certain songs on here might make it better in parts, but it is still a good cd."
2,Half baked effort,"This is not the best Schenker album, but still has a lot of his trademark guitar licks, melodic solos, expert guitar playing and some good vocals by Barden (even containing his trademark bad, I mean BAD, silly and useless lyrics).The trouble lies in the bad production. It is too polished, what would have not been a big problem had it not sounded so lifeless, lacking punch, lacking rawness.Anyway, for a Schenker fan, it's obligatory acquisition."
4,"Very good, hard rockin' CD","I've owned three copies of this casette since it first hit the stores in the early 80's and I still listen to it. Very nice guitar work done by Michael Schenker. He proves his guitar shredding ability on tunes such as the popular ""Captain Nemo"" and ""The Dogs Of War"", which happens to be a ""killer"" tune in it's own right. If you appreciate real good melodic guitar playing and heavy metal the way it should have stayed, with the likes of: Ozzy, Scorpions, Judas Priest, Maiden, and others, then you should really like this CD."
4,The First Truly Entertaining Book on Literary Criticism,Where did this guy Marcus Boon find the time to research all these facts? Amazing collection of the serious and the hysterical. He has definitely studied his area thoroughly. A perfect addition to the political/social/cultural issues of the times. Highly recommended to anyone interested in the involvement of drugs with creativity. Good read. You will definitely have a new must-read list after you're done with this book.I'd buy another book by the same author.
5,An important work of Jewish thought,"This great work of Rabbi Shimshon Raphael Hirsch Z""ts""l was translated and introduced by Dayan Dr. I. Grunfeld. It is a remarkable comprehensive work of Jewish thought. It is divided into Six Sections. The first iscalled 'Toroth' Fundamental principles relating to mental and spiritual preparation for life'.The second is Edoth , Symbolic observances representing truths which form the basis of Israel's life.The third section is 'Mishpatim- Declarations of justice towards human beings. The fourth section is Chukim, Laws of righteousness towards those beings which are subordinate to man; towards earth, plant, animal towards one's own body, mind, spirit and word.The fifth is ' Mitzvoth. Commandments of Love.'The sixth is 'Avodah.Divine Service.'Rabbi Hirsch is a sublime and deep thinker, and this is his major work.It is highly recommended for all those who would deepen in and be uplifted through Jewish learning."
1,Swept Away,"This is not the original R rated version I saw in New York City in 1977. It is edited into mediocrity! Sincerely, Wm Greenwood"
5,THE PERFECTION OF THE ITALIAN COMEDY,"As many other Italian movies, I saw ""The Seven Beauties"" for a few times. One time is never enough. Every time I saw it, I would discover more and more things (words, scenes, faces, mimics, costumes) that I did not see before or I understood them differently. As a good wine, it gets better and better than more you taste it and the more mature it gets (or you get). This film is perfect. The combination of the script, filming, acting, scenes, ideas, and music make it perfect. But Giancarlo Giannini makes it memorable."
4,"First off all, if youre going to do a tribute box...","to a great director, DO IT RIGHT! NOT HALF-ASSED.Whats wrong?While SEVEN BEAUTIES is a much improved transfer, it is NOT 16:9 enhanced;-incredible given the fact this is 2005, not 1998!SWEPT AWAY and SUMMER NIGHTS FULL OF RAIN are 16:9 and look good;So my big queston is: why did they omit THE SEDUCTION OF MIMI and LOVE & ANARCHY? these four films represent the bulk of her classics-SUMMER NIGHTS saw Wertmuller-master as she is-going off course.These films are far more well known to US audiences and are great films-the 'filler"" the box uses THE NYMPH, and FERDINAND AND ISIBELLA are OK, BUT THE PRINTS ARE ATTROCIOUS! and non 16:9...There are Italian versions of TSOM and L&A;, abut they have no english subs..."
3,How to screw up a great film!,"I received my DVD of The Seven Beauties with anticipation, since I'd seen this haunting film before. Crap! My copy was dubbed in English and also had English Subtitles! What idiot would combine these two accoutrements. Did he expect the audience to be pairs of English-speakers, one blind & one deaf? What a waste."
5,taking up serpents,"Being a snake handling buff and unable to read David L. Kimbrough's, Taking Up Serpents for years, I finally had the pleasure. Kimbrough's work far surpasses anything else that has been written on the subject. Kimbrough being an Appalachian and Ph.D. sets the standard for doing oral research along with combing the archieves.Kimbrough's work focuses on the Saylor family in eastern Kentucky and shows how the movement evolved. Kimbrough illustrates how the snake handling movement gained momentum when industrial capitalism surfaced in Kentucky.The work is simply the best source for scholars and people with a general interest in snake handliing. No other book comes close to this masterpiece."
2,mediocre,"What i don't like about this series is that the dialogs are done with a ""realistic"" background noise of, say, a restaurant. The result is that the background noise makes the dialog hard to hear."
5,On the Mound with Randy Johnson,"The name of my book is On the Mound with Randy Johnson by Matt Christopher. It has 116 pages, and it's a biography.The setting is Seattle, in the years of 1982-2000. The plot tells how Randy Johnson got so good a being a pitcher.The reason I like this book is that it's a bioghraphy. Another reason is that Randy Johnson is a good player. Also, I like that, he's won a world series.I think this good for people that are 10-21 years old. If you like biographies, you should check out this book, On the Mound with Randy Johnson."

4,Cynical but useful insights into a career in life insurance,"While it may be slightly dated (published in 1984), Larson offers some great insights into the nature of the life insurance business and how to be successful in life insurance sales. I purchased the book because I am considering a career into the business and was looking for some frank information. I got it with this book and would recommend it to anyone considering selling life insurance."
3,A Mormon Apologetic Piece Couched as Unbiased Scholarship,"I picked this up at the library. I was actually excited to see a non polemical, non apologetic and unbiased treatment of the origins and claims of the Book of Mormon. Within the first thirty pages I was disappointed. This is clearly an apologetic work and not an scholarly study. Givens is at times not even shy about that. He claims that evangelicals are losing the debate against LDS experts on the alleged historicity of the BOM. For every classical problem with the historical narrative of the BOM, Givens cites the stock LDS apologetic responses.It is a good read and interesting but if you were looking for a serious scholarly study than keep looking."
2,Not what it purports to be.,"If you're looking for a disinterested, serious critical evaluation of the Book of Mormon as literature, look elsewhere. This is essentially a compilation of FARMS research (most of it unverifiable beyond what FARMS itself claims), and appears intended ultimately as a defense of the inspired origin of the book (despite the author's denial) for intellectual Mormons. D. Michael Quinn is a far more trustworthy guide to the Book of Mormon and related early Mormon literature."
5,NO BIAS EVIDENT,"Terryl Givens gives an articulate, well-researched analysis of the beginnings of the Book of Mormon, covering material both positive and negative to its origins. One has to read the entire book to determine on which side he comes down. The premise of his writing is that no matter what one thinks of the origins, it still constitutes the second most read book in Northern America. Its place of importance in the religious history on the United States is only surpassed by the Bible. Therefore, a close examination of its origins is enlightening, both as to the doctrine if professes, and as to the legitimacy of its claim."
2,Not a Cary Grant Biography,"Although I liked the way Mary writes (quick read), this was not a book for anyone seeking ""in depth"" or numerous Cary Grant knowledge. Mary was the guide for a tour I took in Hollywood. Based on that tour I bought this book with the hopes of getting more information on Mr. Grant and her security duties. Unfortunately that is not the case.That being said, the book itself is interesting (about Mary's side trips). But I would not recommend it to a Cary Grant fan. You'll just end up wondering, ""where's the rest of the book?"""
5,wow...wow...wow,"I could not put this book down. It has everything...old, and new Hollywood, the world of thoroghbred horse racing. When I got to page 81 I showed it to my husband...thank you Ms Meglemre, thank you, and thank you again. I would recommend it to everyone... because it is such a easy read, and its'a great book to read on your coffee breaks at work."
5,Amazing Lady,"On our recent trip to the states we were lucky enough to meet the Author (if you're reading Mary - Hi it's Kim and Roly Ziesemer from Australia - can't wait 'til you're over this way!!) - however, getting hold of a copy in Australia is easier said than done!!!"
1,Con Artist?,I too had the opportunity to meet the author. She claimed to be donating her time towards Breast Cancer and said she was volunteering to drive a tour bus in Orange County for one week. Don't be fooled. She's a paid employee. We trusted that she was as truthful as the stories she told. Shame on you Mary. Hard to believe that the book (which we bought after meeting her) is any more truthful.
1,Space Fart,"Listening to this group is sort of like the after effects of eating refried beans: lots of excess exhaust produced by a chemical combination of sub-Ozric Tentacles guitar riffs and cheesey synth garbage fx. Yeah, the guitarist sounds like he's on acid and the synth player like he needs some lessons on how to actually play his keyboard instead of simply making goofy sound effects. Instead of listening to these cloned drones from space, get the real thing: Hawkwind, Gong and their legitimate offspring, the Ozric Tentacles."
2,Does NOT really work with 9 dipswitch code,"If you need to use this with a community/group gate for which you cannot reprogram the gate code, then keep shopping.Description should say, in plain language, that this model only has 8 (vs. 9) dipswitches. This may limit its usefulness for some folks, like me, who will have to hassle with the inconvenience of a return."
4,Perfect little Controller,"I like the fact that you keep this one with your keys, not your Car. Great for people with multiple vehicles, like Motorcycles, RVs, and Tractors."
2,same as the clip one just with a keychain,"This one is the same as the one without the keychain; no smaller and includes the visor clip. It does have two buttons instead of one, but most probably do not have a need for 2 buttons. I would just buy one for your visor and remove the visor clip and put your own keychain on it (save 3 bucks). It is quite clunky for a keychain remote."
3,"software needs to be updated, but the dictionary is pretty good.","This product came without any direction on how to install, and I wasn't able to read them from the cd. It is written for a lower version of Windows (I have XP), and hasn't been updated since the 90's. Once I figured out how to type in Russian on my pc, it was easy to look up the words. You have to leave the cd in the drive in order to access the program, even after downloading the dictionary to the hard drive. I think it needs to be updated to work with more modern operating systems and it needs coherent instructions in both Russian and English (I am bilingual and could've used either). I haven't used it extensively, however, it could be much less cumbersome to use. Since it is relatively inexpensive, I do not regret byuing it, and I will use it."
5,POLYGLOSSUM new 3.2v dictionaries-Library,"The new multilingual version of Polyglosssum 3 with search in all dictionaries is very convenient. The new version of the old cost for me only 25 % from the price already purchased by me of old Polyglossum dictionaries.In mine PC and notebook it is the very useful tool, specially during business trips, when there is no the paper dictionaries beside."
1,Bad software,No installation or useage instructions.Impossible to get working. Definatley non-intutitive.Uninstalled and reinstalled two times.
5,Good import CD with Large English-Russian-English dictionary,Good import CD with Large English-Russian-English dictionary Polyglossum II.1) Fast shipping from Europe.2) Friendly and prompt communication with support-team.3) Quality of dictionary - high.4) Work without problems in my new PC and in my old 486-laptopRecommend!
2,A Curiosity,"This brief sketch, though emblematic of Twain's style, was designed only as a private joke among friends. It was printed in very limited quantities during Twain's lifetime, and it seems doubtful that he ever ascribed any lasting literary importance to it.To me, the sketch is too short to represent a highly developed literary endeavor. Also, it isn't very funny, with its childish scatological humor.This particular printing includes some interesting, though poorly organized addenda. It is printed in a bare-bones, desktop publishing format.I would not recommend it to the general reader. It would be marginally interesting only to the Twain scholar."
2,DO NOT USE THIS TEXT,"I used both the previous edition and current edition of this text to teach college students. Both editions were full of errors and contradictory statements. In particular, you cannot rely on the instructor materials- there are many test questions that have answers that are contradicted in the text. Also, the grammar exercises are too difficult for an introductory text- they test students on advanced grammar concepts that are not even covered by the book! There is a grammar reference section at the end of the text but it does not cover the majority of concepts tested in the end-of-chapter grammar exercises. So, my students were continually frustrated. Many of the examples in the book are also very strange- for example, instead of PowerPoint, they speak of ""computer generated slides""."
2,"Too many editions, too expensive","We've used this book for three years to teach college business communications, but it may be time to hunt another book. The book is too expensive at $100. Also, the publisher has issued three new editions in the past three years. That makes it impossible for students to re-sale used books and is frustrating to students and instructors. If the book were a better value, we probably would continue to use it; as it is, we can find something cheaper for our students."
1,What a disapointment,"I'd hoped for a John McPhee type profile on John McPhee. Instead this. As far as information on John McPhee, Wikipedia is just as informative. The author spends minimal time and space on McPhee and maximum space summarizing all of his works. He loves McPhee, as do all of us fans, and is fulsome in his praise but we don't need that.I've been reading McPhee for 55 years, I have read almost all of his works. I wanted to know more about the man who wrote them: how much writing for ""The New Yorker"" affected his style, what other authors influenced him, a day in his life, how he chooses his topics, how he is able to spend as much time as he does on his subjects and how he handles the logistics, what his family thinks about his being away from home so much, etc.This book reads as if it was written for some sort of college English class."
3,Nice Little Story,"I read this book in a day although there wasn't much 'pull' in its plot. The characters are believable and interesting...the main character's relationship with the little kid next door is great - they are both on the same wavelength. I thought his idea for the premium-rate phone line was very funny as it was so scheming and two-faced. Overall, enjoyable enough."
2,A rush job,"A book I was looking forward to, but was very disappointed by. The theoretical parts are ok, but it is nothing you can't find online. The real meat for me was the example code. And oh boy, is it terrible. The chapter on J2ME (the most important one) has two code examples that the author claims are working.These examples won't start, they won't even compile! They are half finished programs written by a Java amateur. I can only hope it is not the author himself, because if it is it casts considerable doubt on the rest of the book.I find it amazing that the publishing company includes this in a published book, they really must have rushed it out. Even more shamefully is the fact that this code is available to download online unchanged at the book site. No errata at all."
4,Great Introduction Book on an Emerging Technology,"The authors do a very good job of stepping through the ""history"" of wireless devices, while keeping focus on developing Bluetooth applications. The examples break down the components to a Bluetooth application and provide a good starting point for developers.I gave a four star rating based on a couple of my personal preferences. First there are a few bulleted list that don't provide much information which take up a lot of page space. (An example would be the list of JSR-82 Expert Group on page 35.) The other comment is the 50 or so pages of the API in the appendices. Although there is a short explanation for each method, interface, constant, etc., I prefer to look that information up online."
3,Save Your Money,Can get all the info you need on the web especially Sun's website such as http://developers.sun.com/.Book doesn't even show you how to set up the Bluetooth API.Shouldn't this book be called Java for Bluetooth not Bluetooth for Java??
3,"Good product, some service questions","Ordered blue, nothing arrived by delivery date, cancelled order, and slightly later same day that cancelled order ""HassleFreeCell"" shipped the item in different color, then claimed had been trying to make contact to advise problem with availability of color ordered. Apart from being delivered late and being wrong color actual phone is good. Subsequent follow up by ""HassleFreeCell"" was satisfactory."
3,good how they packaged it all,"im a bit biased i know-i love rock and punk so stand out tracks for me were the rock ones.but i want to comment on how good they put it together.im glad they included stuff from lots of genres.for a while all NOW cds were was rap and r&b.this cd though has rock and country as well as rap.my fav tracks-franz ferdinand ""take me out"" [one of the best songs!im in luv w/ it],crossfade ""cold"" ;finger eleven ""one thing"" ; beastie boys ""check it out""."
2,Like any other now...,"I don't really like these series. At first, they are hits only popular amoung the younger crowd, then at the end, songs nobody has ever heard about.It is safe to say albums like these are the reason artists like Ashlee Simpson are around, if you can even call her an artist. I cannot forgive her for fooling America and lipsyncing, and you shouldn't either. She is NOT a good singer, and is feeding off her sister who has a beautiful voice. I just wonder why!Anyways, most of the songs are awful. Cold is pretty good song.I would not recommend this CD, it is just all the annoying overplayed songs stuffed together in one repetitive disc.Now should have stayed exclusive to the United Kingdom."
1,what has this world come to???,"This album sucks. Just looking at the names of the songs on this album makes me want to puke. There is only one good song on this album; Take me out by Franz Ferdinand. I bet if Franz Ferdinand new that their song was on this albumm, they would puke as well. If you like this album, you just might me a wigger or a shallow 16 year old girl. Now please excuse me while I slit my wrists."
2,The Now series is going down the drain.,"I can't believe the tracks on this CD. Out of 20, I probably enjoy 5 of those and would listen to them again. As for the rest of the tracks, they are completely forgettable. Why would they put the Beastie Boys on here? Most of the songs are overplayed on here, not to mention horrible sounding. Save your money. The best track is Let's Get It Started, but the overplaying spoils things, unfortunately. Oh yes, and Locked Up is also worth mentioning."
2,ALRIGHT!,"YeS! Finally all the over played songs on the radio are finally on one cd! Wow, as if it wasnt enough that MTV is making my music choices for me, they now give all the [...] you were sick of already so you can listen to it until the songs aren't popular anymore so then i can eagerly wait for the next Now CD by the time in sick of all the crappy singles they put on it!"

1,Garbage,"Since it seems like ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE is doing it, and nobody seems to care, I'm going to give you MORE predictions of what songs will show up on NOW 18. My prediction:More crap.that's all the NOW series is about. promoting junk that you've heard on the radio a thousand times a day for the past month. NOW that's what I call scamming people out of their money!"

4,Musci for Quantum Learning,"I ordered this CD because it had ""Let's Get It Started"" by the Black Eyed Peas on it. I wanted it for Quantum Learning. Some of the songs aren't appropriate for my use because of mature themes and language. I could use some of them however."
4,Better songs but still overplayed songs...,"This CD is not bad and they are finally getting better songs. But, the songs on it are played to death. If you like a song but not other like someone said download them. Because it is cheaper and you get the ones you like. As for the Now 18 reviews not sure because this is for the Now17. When Now 18 hits shelves I will put in my two cents then."
5,whoever thinks this album sucks is a moron,"1.lets get it started-a great song 5/52.lean back-awesome! 5/53.goodies- a good song but it's overplayed 4/54.i like that- pretty good 4/55.ch-check it out-am i the only one who likes this one 5/56.my place- c,mon nelly you can do better than that 2/57.sunshine- an okay song 3/58.you&me-; J-Kwons voice is kinda irratating in this song 2/59.why- it's a great song 5/510.locked up-it's okay 4/511.baby it's you- another okay song 4/512.angels-this one sucks i always skip it 0/513.one thing-pretty good 4/514.dare you to move-good but overplayed 4/515.cold-AWESOME!!!5/516.pieces of me-a good song 4/517.take me out-i like this one 5/518.1985-love it 5/519.here for the party-i hate country music 1/520.days go by-an okay song 3/5"
2,the Nows are going to the dogs!! somebody save the Nows!!,"Does anybody besides me think that the Now That's What I Call Music CDs are going the the dogs? Now they consist of BAD rap/R&B songs and the occasional pop junk. Since when was 2004 all about awful songs?? SINCE WHEN WAS THE 21ST CENTURY THE CENTURY OF STUPID POP AND RAP SONGS?? What this CD should have had was BETTER songs, like American Idiot by Green Day and Somebody Told Me by The Killers. And come on, JESSICA SIMPSON?? The last thing we need is more mindless love songs pounded into our heads. Much less covers of songs. Can't she be ORIGINAL for a change? The only reason I gave this two stars was that I like 1985, Take Me Out, and Dare You To Move. Let's Get it started and One Thing are fairly decent songs, but they're overplayed and get quite annoying. The rest is just JUNK. Unless you're an absolute rap/pop fanatic and like every rap/pop song created. If not, I don't really recommend this."
3,"Now 17 Has Too Much Rap, Now 18 Has Less....","I think Now 17 is a decent cd. I saw the tracklisting for Now 18, and it looks so-so. Some of the songs on there weren't even hits. I took a long at the tracklisting and also the song length of each song on Now 18, and discovered that some songs had been cut by quite an amount (Specifically: Soldier, O, Disappear, Home, and You're My Better Half). I know that they put radio versions and such on there, but I'd actually like to hear the whole song, and not have it cut by 30 seconds or more. That's just my opinion though."
4,"Good CD, but I liked Now 16 better","This CD was pretty good overall, even though Now 16 carried some better tunes. Some of my favorite songs are on this CD like ""Goodies"" and ""Take Me Out"", which are not the only good songs on Now 17. It's kind of like MTV from August - November on one CD. Sure, MTV as a channel sucks, but the music on there is awesome. Though, I don't really like ""You & Me"", ""Locked Up"", ""One Thing"", or ""Cold"", the rest of the CD rocks and I recommend you buy it. And below are some songs Now 18 should have.1. 1, 2 Step2. Shadow3. Over & OverBye bye."
5,This Is What Should Happen,"This Is What Should Happen Now 18 should come in a special edition Set with a bounas disc of songs that were not on now 18:Ashlee simpson: LaLaCiara: 1,2 stepHilary Duff: FlyEminem: Just lose itludacris: get backfranz ferdinand: this firesum 41: were all to blamegreen day: boulevard of broken dreamsbritney spears: my perogitive& N.O.R.E: oye mi canto*Joey*"

4,robbyluvainrhodeisland-Kelly from RI,"dis is by far da best Now yet. if u like the singles on da radio lately, than u basically need dis cd. a good combo of rap (in my opinion, crap-but the songs on the cd r not dat bad), rock, pop, and whatever other stuff the artists in the music industry have been making up lately. u will LUV DIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!U MUST BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Worth Buying,"This was definatly a good CD 2 listen to. But some of the songs are getting old and boring like Let's Get It Started, and Pieces Of Me. On the other hand, some songs were good! Like Goodies, Lean Back, and 1985. Here are some great songs for Now 18 that would make it VERY POPULAR . . .1. Drop it like it's Hot2. Rumors3. My PerogativeThose are just some of the good songs that are popular right now!"
2,Pretty Lame,"I really didn't like this CD at all. The BEP song at the beginning is fun, but the rest of the CD is cloaked in ""sameness"" until the mellow music at the end. This CD appears to be an attempt to try to appeal to everyone. However, in doing so, I think most people will find one or two pieces on it worth listening to more than once and ignore the rest. This may be a factor in current music culture but I did find the majority of the CD heavy on rap."
2,LACKLUSTER....,"these songs ranging from summer of 2004 to fall of the same year suck!!!!! there are a few songs that hit hard but still suck i.e. 'goodies', and 'sunshine'...i hate to say it but 'pieces of me' 'take me out' 'angels' and 'lets get it started' were the best songs that came out those months...but NOW 18 should come back and take over... basically it is the same artist but different songs....they better put destiny's child, the game, lindsay lohan, gwen stefani, 50 cent, jesse mccarthy, and ciara on this disc...do better this next time..."
3,Book Synosis from Romantic Times Magazine,"Gwyneth of Wykston keeps a secret from the world...she's a sleepwalker, a habit that in medieval England could have her branded as a witch. One night she slips past her ever-watchful maid, into the dangerous woods and onto the path of a knight's charging steed.From the moment the woman walked out of the midnight mist and into his life, Sir Alain Fitz de Personne cannot free his mind of the Saxon beauty. When the king commands Alain to marry the lady and hold her keep under royal authority, he is happy to comply. But will the maiden ever trust him with the secrets of her heart?A classic tale of love between a Norman knight and a Saxon heiress, THE ROSE IN THE MIST is a charming story of the blossoming romance between two people who begin the journey as enemies and form a most unlikely alliance. However, the novel is hampered by misunderstandings between the hero and heroine, which are resolved early ..."
5,Join The U.S. Air Force And Get Chicks!!!That's The Fantasy!,In this movie a young Richard Gere joins the Air Force in the hope of a beter life. The girls who live near the base camp are willing to do anything to get to marry a Naval Aviator.Sadly Richard and his best friend do not see past the deceptiveness of these two girls played by Deborah Wiger and Lisa Blount. This movie seems to be sending out the message that if you are a woman trapped in a tedious job then all you gotta do is find a successful guy to rescue you from your life. Gee. I though that concept went out the window back in the days of Knights In Shining Armour Rescuing Poor Damsels In Distress. I give this movie 5 stars because it is a another sad attempt by Hollywood to portray Fantasy as Reality.
1,an officer and gentleman,"i was very disappointed on this purchase. first it was not close captioned as indicated. second the video was under very good condition which it was not. squeaked when playing on vcr. i did not ask seller for refund, just thought it was not worth it to pursue. sbandajr"
1,"U.S. buyers, beware!","I ordered this for my mom's bday because it's her favorite movie.When she got it, she was sad to learn that it was from the UK and couldn't play on our U.S. DVD player!!!I was very disappointed. This should have been more clearly marked on the product!"
5,Romantic movies,"I made a valentines basket for my sweetheart this year, and along with a bunch of other goodies, massage oils and candies etc, I added a couple of older romantic movies that have been around for awhile. The price was right, and the shipping was fast. He loved the basket!!"
2,What is all the hype about?,"The movie's plot was thin and cliche, the lines were borderline cheesy, and the acting was nothing special. Despite all the nudity, the movie has no edge and when I try to think about a favorite scene, my mind goes blank. Save for the final scene, where is the romance? I simply don't understand why this movie is so highly rated, but perhaps it is because for its time, it might have been a masterpiece. Nevertheless, if a movie cannot transcend time, it isn't a success."
4,Drama and Romance,"Basically Gere joins the armed forces because ""he's got no where else to go"" and his Drill Sgt (Louis Gossett Jr) is going to make him or break him. Filled with now classic scenes and lines this is a movie that if you haven't seen you need to. Debra Winger (see Urban Cowboy) is a girl who's looking for love in all the wrong places. Will she find it in the unlikely Gere or will he just be another notch on her belt? Excellent movie."
5,The Best Movie,I love this movie so much. I have seen it so many times but I still keep watching it every chance I get. Richard Gere and Debra Winger are great together. I recommend it to anyone who who loves a really great love story. It is truly a classic!
4,Girl Gets What Girl Wants,"This is just a simple old-fashioned love story, 1992-style. Lower-class loner guy joins Navy, gets into OCS to be a pilot and, along the way, meets a homie who wants a sailor to take her away from her factory job. A fling turns into the real thing, no matter how hard he tries to deny his feelings for her and, in the end, rescues the factory princess and drives away with her.A true chick flick."
4,Could have been tragic and it was just romantic,"And some say romantic films don't exist anymore, among others Scott at the New York Times. Here is a perfect example of such romanticism, in a modern environment, that of a navy academy somewhere in the US. Romanticism, drama as well as happy ending, one casualty and one total epiphany. What's more you add to that the bad character of the salvaged hero at the beginning and his complete transformation into a good man, a good heart and a fair mind that will not play around and will finally do what his conscience tells him to do and his hormones force him to fall into. And what's more, the film avoids the dire tragic tone of all the rewritings of Romeo and Juliet. But of course that does not make it a great film, just a soft sweet entertaining moment in life.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"
4,R chard Gere at his best,I remember thinking how good both Richard Gere and Debra Winger are in this movie and was wondering why it was not on blu ray sadly the female co-star in the film passed away unnoticed after a lengthy illness . It's a very good film I'm glad it's finally about to arrive as they say IT!'S BETTER LATE THAN NEVER . Thanks PARAMOUNT FOR REALIZING THAT WE OF THE OLDER GENERATION GO FOR THE FILMS FROM THE LATE 1950s through the 80s ( BUT THEY HAVE TO BE DAMN GOOD MOVIES ) THANKS M T L
5,Best Movie Ever,"Can't go wrong with this love story... Make sure to have some your tissue near,... Moive leaves you feeling good! I give it a A++++++++++++++"
4,I liked this!,I have always liked this. One of the best about some of the things people go throgh to be come the best life has for them.
5,Finalist for L.A. Times Seidenbaum Award for First Fiction,This evocative and beautifully written debut novel was just named a finalist for the L.A. Times Art Sedenbaum Award for First Fiction to be awarded April 29th at the Times Festival of Books at UCLA. The story is riveting and the narrator's voice - that of eight year-old Grace - is spell-binding. I urge you to grab a copy if you can still find a hardback or buy the paperback when it is published in April.
3,Nifty,"This is a great first novel. The writer has a quirky tone and explored the issues she raised in an interesting fashion. My only problems with it are that everybody seems to have their own eccentricities -- yes, that's probably true to life, but the book is filled with'em, so you end up waiting to see what the next person's kink will be, so the effect wears on you as you go through it. Also, the book sort of repeats the same kind of scene throughout, like a record skipping in a groove. Perhaps that's intended, but I don't think so. I get the feeling the writer was just unsure how to carry off some of the scenes, so she stuck with what she was comfortable with.But, ounce for ounce, it's an entertaining book -- much better than the way overhyped ""The Beach""."
4,beautifully crafted,"although this book may not seem to have the basic problem solution that most storylines have, last things is about a young girl, grace, that doesn't understand that the reality that her mother has given her is harshly twisted as her dad desperetly tries to set the record straight. it is a fairly easy read because it is told from the point of view of grace, and i would recommend it to anyone!"
1,What a disappointment.,"After reading the reviews and seeing the 5 stars, I couldn't wait to get my CD. What a disappointment ! I have enjoyed Robin Trower for many, many years and this is truly the worst I have heard. It sounds like an amateur recording in a coffee house. do yourself a BIG favor. Save your $$$$$"
3,"Sex, gore and idiots","Readable, but gratuitious sex just isn't my cup of tea, and the ending depends on all of the characters being complete and utter morons to make any sense."
5,This book is the best.,"I read this book twice because it was so good. It is a great msytery novel & I would recommend it too anyone interested in msytery novels. There are twists & turns, all unpredictable.It's one of my favourite books."
4,Airplane! (1980) / Top Secret! (1984),"I loved both of these movies when I was a teenager. Now I am buying them both for my children. If you like good, dumb and stupid humor than this video is for you. Fun for the whole family! and laugh away while you can"
5,Jazz fan,Beautiful ballad album!! I could listen to this album over and over. Robert really captures each song with his soulful tenor.
2,not what was ordered,This company is sending a different pattern than what was pictured. I deal with model horses and the one they sent has a very large pattern and it will not work. I can get large pattern material anywhere. This is the reason I bought this one . It shows a small design that would have been perfect. I won't trust this company again.
1,Sent wrong item,They sent wrong item. I called and sent it back the way I was instructed to do and I have NOT received proper item. could you please follow up on this for me?Thanks Roger
3,Agent Double O Duece 4 Blocc & The CPT,When I first heard this cd I would have givin it 4 stars but the more I listen to it the more it gets boring and the less I like it. Don't get me wrong it's not really a bad cd just average. You can tell Lynch and Eiht didn't come as tight as they could and were holding bak. I'd say the biggest upside of this cd is the production. It's pretty good. I'd say this is one a them cd's you buy when you got some cash to burn and lookin for somethin new to bump. . .
2,Not impressed,"Although this album isn't TOO bad, it's not an album worthy of the name ""The New Season""When I saw this album I figured it would be a mix of MC Eiht's slow gangsta style and Brotha Lynch's siccmade. I don't know where, but somewhere along the line Brotha Lynch has abandoned his old style and he sounds like just another rapper from the West Coast.Bring back Season of da Siccness and Loaded."
2,Lynch a shadow of his former self,"I had such high expectations for this album, maybe too high. The earlier Brotha Lynch from the 90's was classic underground; this is just so mainstream. It sounds just like every other rap album today. I still have faith in Lynch, but never again should he team up with MC Eiht, he's dragging the brotha into the toilet with him, we can't have that! Anyway, the only track on this entire album even worth a listen to, once or twice, is ""Agent Double O Duece 4 Blocc"", only becaues it's a remake of ""Rest in Piss"" Don't B wastin yo bank."
2,why doesn't amazon provide more info???,"This product has virtually no information about the cordless phones for which it can be used. I received it in no time, yet it didn't support my phone model. Since I've already opened the package, I pretty much have no recourse. MORE INFORMATION PLEASE!!!"
2,Battery did not work,"Must be old stock - battery did not take a charge. Seller was gracious and allowed me to return it for a full refund, which I received very quickly."
4,A classic from CHER,"Before ""Believe,"" before ""If I Could Turn Back Time,"" before many of her current fans were even born, Cher recorded a timeless album that remains the foundation of her career. This album contains Cher's most famous song, the title track ""Gypsys, Tramps, and Thieves,"" as well as the huge hit ""The Way of Love."" Beyond that the highlights include James Taylor's ""Fire and Rain,"" which is my favorite cut on the album, as well as ""He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother"" previously recorded by...well, everybody. This is an emotion packed album delivered with gusto. Two more amazing songs are ""I Hate To Sleep Alone,"" and ""One Honest Man."" Now if you're looking for the disco-queen, she's not here. However, if you're looking for some of Cher's most amazing vocal performances...you'll find them on this album."
4,"Cher the 2nd time around, with Snuffy","This lp certainly brought the Cher of the seventies up to date. Snuff Garrett her producer found a clean playful pop presentation that found Cher refreshing and young again.Her superb contralto is strong and lusty.""The way oflove"",and ""Gypsies Tramps and Thieves"" shine on this vibrant lp. ""I hate to sleep alone "" resonates here as well.The maudlin,but heart-felt ballad ,""He'll never know"" is perfect Cher pathos!She sings about her son secretly fathered by another man!My only comment on the constructive side is that this lp feels a bit superficial,the new Cher sounding slightly too pop-ish and a tad too slick.However, her follow-up ""Foxy Lady"" in 1972 went a step further,and carried more depth.It featured the excellent ""living in a house divided""It has been released in uk but not here in cd form(USA).Still, this cd sounds fresh in 2005 as it did in 1971.For the younger fan that missed her 2nd incarnation..buy it!Cher is a great pop singer."
5,Paper Garden: A pleasant trip down south,"Jerome Wilson's debut collection fulfills a promise that was apparent when the title story was published in Ploughshares over a decade ago. His skillfully woven characters, such as Sonny Buck, Jessie Leigh and Tammy Faye Lovejoy, draw the reader in, not only by the stories they tell, but through their neighbors' stories, the towns the live in and the people they encounter.Paper Garden takes a trip down south that is sometimes funny, sometimes shocking, but always engaging. By the end of the last story, the reader has been taken on as much as an emotional ride as Sonny Buck on the ferris wheel. Paper Garden is well worth the purchase. I hope we see more from this writer in the future."
4,"Unique thesis, a little fluff","Vallee's precious contribution to UFO research is his agnosticism and ability to see a third option: UFO's may not be physical ""aliens"", but they may also defy classification as pure psychological anomalies. So what are they? Vallee presents a fresh possibility.The only reason I don't give The Invisible College 5 stars is the excess number of UFO cases documented. Granted, they may have been more necessary in 1975, when the book was published, but I doubt it. Most of us had been indoctrinated into the typical variations of UFOlogy by 1960 - but Vallee does retell the cases with clarity and intelligence."
3,Old Dog Tricks?,"Good enough book, but came dirty? Guess it was used and they didn't clean it up or wipe off the cover before sending it....thought I was getting a book geared towards how to teach an ""old"" dog tricks, but it seems to be just a basic trick book geared for any dog. Should be useful though."
5,Attention collectors,"This is truly a remarkable album from a group who only put out one album.They really are in a class with the Stylistics,Blue Magic etc.Real soul music,the way it's supposed to be.Get this one if you can ,you won't be sorry."
4,What More Can Be Said?,"With all that has been written about this album, I'll keep it brief. Just a couple of comments to add:Two of the best cuts on this album are bonus tracks. ""Mr. Lucky"" for me captures the quintessential Vegas sound. You know, before Vegas became Disney with slots. I love it when Buddy yells out ""Yeah, baby!"" during Bill Prince's trumpet solo. And then there's Art Pepper's fantastic rendition of ""Chelsea Bridge."" Was there ever a better altoist than Art Pepper (including Bird)?""Goodbye Yesterday"" is one of my favorite Don Piestrup tunes. Like most of his stuff, it sounds a bit dated, but hey, it was a great time! Also, if a band could play his complicated harmonies, you know they had to be good.If you like ""Channel One"" (and who doesn't?), check out the version on the recently-released ""WHAM!"" Although the recording quality isn't the best, the band will knock your socks off."
1,Doesn't have suction,"Tried wetting surface and wetting bracket. Tried on tile and granite. piece of junk. Don't bother Not sure if mine is defective, but will be sending it back. Would have been a great inexpensive alternative"
3,"About ""Psychological Trauma""","This book is about psychological trauma; the trauma itself, it's consequenses and the effects of traumatic stress on body function. The book is well written and well organized. It is interesting to read about the historical development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and to discover how different the consequences of trauma can be. The only drawback is that it's quite old for this area of psychology, which has developed fast in the last few years. Therefore, the author doesn't mention new methods for treating PTSD like EGG-biofeedback and EMDR. But as mentioned a well written book about an interesting field of science."
4,Up close and personal with Buster,I highly recommend reading Mr Blesh's book basically because he gives us a better view of Buster's personal life. He particularly focuses on his childhood and the years prior to 1920. This I found very interesting. He does seem to completely avoid the period betweens Buster's first marriage to Natalie Talmadge and his third marriage to Eleanor. This was a bit frustrating since I am very curious about these years. Blesh skims over what I am sure would be fascinating if not depressing reading. Keep in mind that Mr. Blesh was a freind of Busters so he is more respectful of Buster than some authors have been. All in all the book is very good and comes highly recommended.
3,Disappointed,"I purchased one of these mugs from my local supermarket in their ""gift"" section several years ago. A few weeks ago, I dropped it on a tile floor and it shattered. I purchased this as a replacement. I used it ONCE, and it is cracked. I did not put it in the dishwasher or microwave. Because I love this design, I will order another one. But I will use extraordinary care and caution in handling it."
2,Wrong item sent.,Double check what you get. They sent me the wrong item in the correct box. I returned but didn't get another.
3,doesn't work for me,"I might have given a better review with a different modem/internet connnection, but I'm using qwest here and there's nothing on the modem they gave me that allows me to fasten it or otherwise interface it to this bracket. It also only fits well vertically. If I set it horizontally in the smc the pegs only fit in the very outer holes where it becomes hard to reach. If these came with some sort of strap maybe or an alternative method to fasten such modems it might be a better product. Also this doesn't apply to this product...but these pegs that come with the smc are incredibly cheap...they break way too easily."
5,Amazing History of Southern Jews,I read this book after learning of a friend of mine who grew up Jewish in Jackson Mississippi and went through everything Nelson talks about. The book was incredibly written and Nelson is a phenomonal Journalist. I highly recomend this book to anyone looking to learn more about American history or history of Jews in the South.
4,Good book,"This is of particular interest to people living in Mississippi in the 1960's. I was a child during this time and knew the children of the players in the book. I never knew the terrible things they were going through. It gave me a deep appreciation of the people involved. It also made me think in ways that I had never really considered. For example, the fact that the Klan is a terrorist organization rather than a bunch of rednecks in sheets."
4,Long Misty Days,"This is a great album! Caladonia rocks hard and puts you in a great and energetic mood, what an awesome cover!!!! This Robin Trower/Jimmy Dewar album is up there on top. Don't miss this album but if you HAVE to choose between this and one of the others choose Bridge of Sighs or Essential. I just can't imagine why Robin Trower is so underrated! He is one of the greatest guitar legends of all time. To me he is unrivaled... except by only Jimi Hendrix."
5,Subtle masterfull guitar,"sometimes drifting with the evenflo tides of this music , you can barely recognize that you are listening to a guitar at all. the blending of instruments and incredible play of robin trower at his peak is undeniably some of the finest work ever recorded. lay back relax and fly !"
5,ROBIN TROWER-LONG MISTY DAYS/IN CITY DREAMS,"IN CITY DREAMS IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE ROBIN TROWER,IT JUST SEAMS TO CLICKFOR ME/LONG MISTY DAYS IS GOOD."
4,Buy this for In City Dreams,"If you start at track 10 this CD is a five star. Long Misty Days is a three star CD thus the 4 star average. Track 10 is when In City Dreams starts. There is some really important and excellent music there that only slightly falls short of Bridge of Sighs which remains, to date, Robin Trower's masterpiece.Props to the engineers who reworked the master tape but the combination of these two albums makes no sense to me."
5,A good thing in a small package,"Just bought two of these and will purchase a few more for tool boxes. The oiler is refillable with a metal top and O ring. The container helps to protect the tool when not in use and stored amoung other tools in box.I am a little mistified about the other reviewer crimping the body of the tube. The product dispenses percise drops of oil when the body is compressed. At a half way point of compression simply release pressure to allow air in and begin oiling again.Two other nice features are the cap with pocket clip and the long needle which allows for deep penitration into oiling points.Great for guns, reels, switches, locks, door hindges or any application where spray oil could contaminate surrounding areas.Truely a fine percision tool!!!! Believe me this is no toy!"
3,Precision oiler tube.,"This Product is not a ToyBut oiler is not as thick of plastic as I had hoped.very thin, delicate made. if you squeeze it too hard then it is permanently crimped.I hoped it was thicker and strongerIt's still better then the oiler I was using."
2,The product does not match the photos...,"Aurelle is a great idea, but it is not yet perfected. First off, one of the ""candles"", in the package of ten, does not work so now I have to figure out how to get a replacement. Secondly, the brightness and color of the light is not anywhere near what is depicted in the Phillips provided photographs. The light does flicker realistically, but it is a very dim orange light. Compared side by side with a real votive or tealight, the Aurelle is a lackluster simulation.On the other-hand, Aurelle is very easy and convenient to use."
4,The Delta Star,"This book was one of Joseph Wambaugh's best. The characters were unusually well developed,especially Ludwig. I really love the way Wambaugh weaves a number of different characters into the story and brings random events into the focus of the story. Wambaugh is really good at this. Also, some of the scenes in the book are just plan funny. They will actually make you laugh out loud. Rare for an author to be able to tell a really compelling and serious story and and also make you appreciate the fact that life can create some really funny moments. I highly recommend this book."
2,Pedestrian,I am a fan of Wambaugh's but this book was weak. I found that it dragged incredibly at one point (when the cops were at the campus party and looking for the suspect) and the dialogue was boring.There were good moments in the novel but I got the feeling that the author had had run out of new ideas and lost the humour that some of his earlier books possessed.
3,Good book for if just starting in real estate or novice.,"The book goes from ""what is a farm"" to ""Getting successful results"". Several example letters are in the book. Most are quite lengthy and therefore wouldn't get read. Others are shorter and to the point. All can be modified to fit your situation. Example farm letters go from initial contact to ""Thank You"" letters after the close of the sale. Overall, a lot of imformation. Take the info. you can use and leave the rest."
1,Don't waste your money....written in 1996,"I bought this book without reading the publishing date had I done that in the begining I would not have purchased a book written more then 10 years ago. While it may have been informative back in 95 it is way off the mark now, wordy letters, telling you how to do manual searches for records that are now a click away online. Really a waste of money...unless of course you are a time traveling agent LOL"
4,Loved the Sheets,Recently ordered these sheets the price was too good not to try them. After the first wash they were great. Wonderful texture and beautiful too. Will definately buy more and would reccomend them to friends
5,rose arbor sheets,"I love these sheets.They are a pale lilac with a very subtle jacquard print.I have had these sheets for over a year and they stilllook the same.The sheets are crisps they are not baby soft,but with repeated washings have gotten softer.The sheets are beautiful."
3,Ultimately disappointing,"I'm a big fan of GEN Zinni, having first heard him speak during a video presentation about Somalia in 1998. I had high hopes for this book, and expected to learn something new about the security environment of the United States in the 21st Century. Instead, the book reads like a summation of Thomas Barnett's ""The Pentagon's New Map"" and ""A Blueprint for Action"". War in the context of everything else, new rule sets, the Leviathan Force/Sys Admin concept, Functioning Core/Non-integrated Gap comparisons, all these concepts are presented in ""The Battle for Peace"", just under different names. The concepts are made particularly relevant by the breadth and depth of GEN Zinni's experience as a Marine, Joint Warrior, and diplomat, but the content is basically the same. I found myself wanting something more."
1,Dishonest author,"Zinni writes that he never saw any credible evidence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.However, in 2000, Zinni testified before Congress that Iraq was the biggest threat facing the United States. ""Iraq remains the most significant near-term threat to U.S. interests in the Arabian Gulf region,"" Zinni told Congress on March 15, 2000.""Despite claims that WMD efforts have ceased, Iraq probably is continuing clandestine nuclear research, retains stocks of chemical and biological munitions, and is concealing extended-range SCUD missiles, possibly equipped with CBW [chem-bio-weapons] payloads,"" Zinni saidIn boot camp, we Marines were taught that Marines do not lie, cheat or steal. It's disappointing to see a Marine Corps general disregard that."
5,"Pin, pin who can see the pin","Just purchased a pin nailer and purchased these pins to go with it. Their called micro pins, and for good reason - when used you can't see them. They just disappear in the wood, paint over them and all signs of them are gone. I'm very glad I got a pin nailer, as it is very useful, glue it, pin it , you're done."
3,No complaints but picture is misleading,I recently purchased these to go along with a pinner that I purchased off Amazon. The nails seem to perform just fine but I was a bit disapointed to get only a single package of nails. From the picture it appears that you are getting a box that contains 5 package of nails. But be aware that you are getting only one package. The description reads (3000 per box) which lead me to believe that I was getting 1500 nails but that is not the case. I haven't really priced these out else where but $9.24 for a single package of nails seems a bit on the high side to me.
3,Ignore Kireviewer,"No, Dave Stewart is not the singer for Hatfield & the North -- where Kireviewer got that is a mystery. Richard Sinclair is the singer, and I'd say he does a pretty decent job. And no, this is not Hatfield's best release. Geez, you have to wonder! The first two releases are the ones to get (from 1973 & 1974). This is a one-off ""reunion"" concert. Not bad -- but not classic Hatfield & the North."
4,Dave Stewart is NOT on this,"This one shot reunion CD of the great 70's band is well worth having due to the great musicians on it, but please know that the seminal keyboardist Dave Stewart is the only original member of the band who is not on here. His absence is very much heard. In his place is drummer Pip Pyle's (then?) girlfriend Sophia Domancich on keyboards. She's a very respectable musician in her own right, but she is no Dave Stewart.So sure, hear some great musicians breeze through some great music, but without Dave Stewart, to me, this isn't really Hatfield and the North. Still, I'm glad to own it, and I wouldn't part with it."
5,wonderful love Rumer Godden! I would like to see all of Rumer Goodden's books available on kindle books. She is a great author,Godden takes humble littile ofjects like a kitchen madonna or little Japanese dolls and winds the characters aroung them. She makes profound statements very subtlely. I am a real fan!
3,Enjoyed this,"My 8 year old is a reading fanatic. She really liked this book, but it was a very fast read (about an hour and a half)....my point being that I think it is better for a ""newer reader"". Even for an 8 year old, however, it is interest catching. Just know that a less experienced reader (6 or certainly 7yr old) could also read this!"
4,Bought for my mom. She loves it,She was a one of a kind song writer. My mom had the lp years ago that was lost ina fire. She was elated to get this and I will get her some of the other releases in the future. I am not sure of how good the reproduction is since I have not heard it.
3,great computer but.........,"I bought my HP last December and fell in love with it until a few days later when the keyboard started to act up. As I was typing it started missing letters or just froze. I put up with it until last month and then called HP and told them I hated the keyboard and mouse because of the intermitent way it was working. They express shipped a new keyboard and mouse to me and this one seems to be working better, although every once in a while when I move the keyboard it goes back to missing letters. The photo printer sits right behind the screen, saving space on my desk. A great looking computer, and I can even comes with a remote to watch TV. Everyone raves about the look and loves it when they come by."
4,same old,"We've had our HP for 2 weeks or so. We found out right away about the keyboard, after I first changed the batteries. I thought they might be down as we bought a shelf model, less than $1000. at Office Depot. I feel this is good, as it is burned in, so to speak and we could avoid the so-called ""Black Screen"" We like it otherwise, nice computer with great features, but we wish it all folded up flat, as we are snowbirds and it would be much more convenient"
5,Christmas gift,"I bought this computer after it was specifically pointed out to me in a Costco store by my 14 yera old son. I read a few reviews about this unit and it had mixed reviews. I bought it anyway. My son LOVES this thing. The touch screen aspect seems to make him especially happy. It was very easy to set up (one review said they had to hire the Geek Squad to get it going. What an idiot.) and has performed without trouble. My son is on this thing most of his waking hours, so that is saying something."
3,"Nice to look at, not worth the price...","I have owned the HP IQ770 for over six months and use it as my main PC. My intial issues were related to using the installed Vista operating system... but for better or worse, Vista is here to stay.Now back to HP IQ770. It does a fair job, though I feel it is slow for a pc in this price range. The multicard reader failed about two months ago, dead and not servicable or accessable by the user. The DVD/CD burner is unreliable; sometimes not 'seeing' CD's or DVD's I loaded in it. The DVD/CD drive has jammed on occassion and refused to eject my disk. There is no access to this drive, either should it quit. There are no outputs for a second monitor; would be nice in the event of failure of the 'built-in' monitor. No HDMI, DVI, parallel, or serial ports you can NOT expand the stock system. You can not add a PCI card.The HP IQ770 does have a ""WOW"" factor due to its unique and very nice appearance... after that you will find it a very mediocre PC."
1,Slow and Expensive,"I have had several like units and this was by far my least favorite. Performance was SLOW and the subscriptions required to make the unit function properly were more expensive (at least at the lower end of the user scale) than the competition while the competition was much faster.Due to the slow speed I only purchased the one unit which has been collecting dust for ages. I had forgotten about this product but it is reaching the end of life and the company has contacted my a few times to offer my an discounted ""upgrade"" to a product that specs a slower throughput than this unit - at least they offered a reasonable price."
3,"Quality Issues, but works","Stands are the least glamorous piece of musical equipment, but they are a necesity. I wanted a stand for my laptop while Djing/playing live music, and wanted something collapsible, that I could trow in my bag.The Stand is horribly constructed, the threads on the ends are not machined properly, so you need to add a piece of something in between the screws else the whole contraption wables.It is also fairly heavy, so carrying it adds up to your load.Overall, I would recomend it if you need a fixed stand that you won't take apart every other day, but the search continues for a better stand for my gigs, and odyssey,please do some quality control on your products."
4,Good Stand for the money.......,"Suits my needs perfectly. A little rough putting together because of the threads, but WD-40 fixed that issue. Once it is together it is excellent for my scenario (Sturdy and remains fixed all the time; I don't need to collapse it). A Great product for the money......."
5,pleased. again!,"i have yet to receive anything ordered from amazon that has not made me happy. the price was great and it was received quickly and without hassels! thanks again, amazon!! :)"
2,Not sure why people liked this,"This book basically tells you to go and buy a bedwetting alarm. It doesn't have any actual tips on getting your kid dry any other way. I checked it out from the library thinking the ""program"" might be something to try before we spent the $70+ on the alarm. I would have been angry if I bought this book only to have it tell me over halfway through that the ""program"" is to use a bed wetting alarm. This book is just to answer questions for people who don't know how to use google search."
5,Practical guide for children abd parents,"Given the pace of family practice, I often don't have enough time to deal with problems such as bedwetting. ""Waking Up Dry"" is a terrific book that provides a lot of information in a clear and concise manner that not only explains why children wet the bed, but also what they can do to fix the problem. The book is brimming with practical tips that make it easier to treat the condition. For example, this is the first book I've seen that gives children advice on how to handle sleepovers or what to do if someone discovers their bedwetting supplies by accident. Children will also enjoy the cartoon characters and humor that make the book fun to read. I will enthusiastically recommend this book to all of my patients who suffer with this medical problem. Joseph Cama, M.D."
4,Helpful strategies for a tough problem,"We found this book extremely useful. When we bought the book, our 10-year-old son was wetting his bed every night. The book was clear and entertaining (for parent and child alike), and the strategies were both humane and effective. During the two months before his 11th birthday, our son wet the bed once, thanks to this book."
2,"Millstone Home Cafe Coffee Pods, French Roast, 16-Count Packages (Pack of 6)",The Millstone Coffee Pods are OK. The French Roast is a little to bitter for my taste. The amount of coffee in the pods is to generous for my Senseo Deluxe. I use two pods for the mug size setting and have to manipulate the the pods to enable closing the top of the maker.The wait for delivery was to long.
5,Good cup of strong coffee for sure!,I use these in my Senseo and they work just fine. I think they make a much stronger cup of coffee than the brand recommended for use in the Senseo. Very pleased with this French Roast !
4,Great Product,Glominerals lip pencil is pricey but well worth it. It is so smooth and blends well with all lip color.
4,Covers so much,This book covers so many types of paintings from traditional to some abstracts. The examples are well done and very helpful. Might be a bit too involved for a new artist to understand. Lots of information.
1,Recommends non-lightfast colors!,"What are all these 5 star reviewers thinking??? Aureolin and rose madder--Dobie's recommended yellow and red primaries, are extremely fugitive--they fade in a short time.Because of this alone, the book should be vigorously rejected as coming from dubious authority. Her plan for making colors ""sing,"" by the way, involves placing an occassional bright color in a field of grays or browns, mixed not from earth pigments, but from (fugitive) primaries. It would be irresponsible of me to perpetrate such a book on an unsuspecting public by giving it any stars at all. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't have a ""zero"" stars option. If you want a superior book that will show you much better ways to make colors ""sing,"" get ""Perfect Color Choices for the Artist,"" by Michael Wilcox."
5,The best book on color I have ever read or owned.,Jeanne Dobie truly makes color sing. She also makes color theory understandable. Her paintings are beautiful. I have had this book for several years and have gone through it over and over. A real color bible. If I could only have one book in my art instruction library this would be the one.
3,Color Theory for Watercolorists,"This book deals with color theory for watercolorists, particularly the use of a limited palette originated and championed by the author. There is little or no discussion of basics such as brushes, paper, etc.Artists looking to reduce the number of pigments on their palette while keeping a full range of color will find the author's ideas and color theory of interest."
3,"Okay book, but...","The book cover is misleading. It gives the impression that this book is geared towards painting wet on wet. But its really a mixture of wet on wet and painting positive/negative. Which is okay if that's your style of painting. I think the artist is very talented, however, the biggest flaw for anyone is to make assumptions. I agree with Nigel (Austin)...What's with the 5 stars !!!"
4,Useful but flawed color reproduction,"Yes, Dobie's suggestions on how to approach choosing and using colors are inspiring and useful. However, at least in my copy, in many of the illustrations colors were simply not reproduced accurately. In another book this might not be quite so frustrating. But in many places, rather than making the text more explicit she leaves it to the example to make her point. In those cases I sometimes found it difficult to grasp what she meant. Maybe for her next book she should seek another publisher, or at least a different printer."
4,Gold Diggers 1933,"I am an avid movie buff of Busby Berkeley films which I compare with todays movies. The story lines and dialogue were in their infancy, but in today's society I find them infantile.How hard the actors and actresses worked doing all their own stunts - singing, dancing, swimming, whatever the part required they did it. I revere the early hollywood stars, they appear to have a healthy respect for themselves and others, which is not something many of the stars appear to have today."
5,Simply the BEST!!,"Peep and the Big Wide World are simply wonderful CD's! With Joan Cusack as the narrator, they are irresistible for teaching toddlers and preschoolers about science in a delightful way! Peep, Quack, and Chirp are an ensemble we welcome into our lives everyday and my 2.7 year old granddaughter is mesmerized by Chirp's brilliance, Quack's quick wit, and Peep's innocence. This is top drawer and it holds a young one's attention incredibly!"
3,Cheap clip,"It's almost not worth complaining since it was so cheap. However, the clips are cheap stamped metal and are nearly impossible to remove off my DX6i."
5,It's Hitman...need I say more?!,"A great game(s) at a great price. The only bummer is that the original is not on there, but that's really no big deal. This game, while outdated graphically, is still a fantastic game. The story line and game play makes the game...and it does it well. If you like to get your use out of games, you can't go wrong with this series. There are endless ways to do each mission, so there is very little redundancy."
4,A great game in a great series,"This game continues the great tradition of the previous hitman games. It has improved graphics and allows you to benefit from a well-executed mission by being paid for the hits and being able to use that money to upgrade your weapons, customizing them to be more accurate and lethal. The game allows a wide variety of choices in how to accomplish a mission and there is no ""right"" way to beat a mission. The only problem that this game still suffers from is that the AI still needs improvements. Situations that you would expect the guards to get suspicious and start shooting will only get a warning, whereas a simple mistake that should only get the guards suspicious results in them pulling out their guns and blasting away at you when you just tried to open a door that didn't have any signs to Keep Out. Overall, this was a fun game."
5,Besides the Vista Issue....,The trilogy is great. There's something darkly funny about dropping a piano on someone. XDThe gameplay is simply amazing. The Ai is pretty much human or close.I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a challenge and for those who just love stelth games.Hitman: Silent Assassins-9/10Hitman: Contracts-10/10Hitman: Blood Money-12/10
4,Great Classics for a Great Price,"I've always loved the Hitman games, and now that I have this Trilogy, I can play them on my PC for as long as I want. This is a great bundle, very happy with my purchase."
2,Review,"Very nice book, but it took a little while to get into it. Peltz' style of writting could flow a little better but when one reads books written by anthorpologists you know what you are getting into."
5,Standard Guide to American Muscle Cars,"Overall a very informative book on muscle cars from the '60's to the '90's. It's an excellent start for us younger people to learn about the older muscle cars that we didn't get to see as we were growing up. This book covers most of the significant muscle cars that have come out of America from the years 1960-1995. If you are interested in buying a muscle car but aren't exactly sure what car you want to get, this book will help you narrow down your choices."
3,OK,"This book is alright. Although not entirely accurate, its OK for someone new to muscle cars. Most of the muscle cars are covered and all have descriptions of there different models. There is also a price guide in the back for those interested in specific models and years."
3,Could've Been Worse,"I liked it but it's an introduction not a comprehensive, in-depth analysis regardless of what the title says. Beware of pretty covers and sugar coated words when buying books. As the one reviewer states ""not accurate"" but it's worth looking into if you're new to the muscle car genre."
1,Crumbles and runs when wet,"The first time I used this on my daughter, it crumbled when I rubbed it in to her skin. I thought it might have been her dead skin rubbing off, so I ignored it. Later, when she got wet, the lotion started running down her face and body in white streaks. This concerned me because I didn't want it getting into her eyes and such. Anyhow, I used it a second and third time and found the same results of crumbling and running when wet on both my daughter and her cousins.I would not purchase this product again."
3,"Does the job, smells well, but ...","It is a bit thick and takes a while to rub in. Not the easiest thing to do with a squirming 9 month old. No matter how well something works, if it is going to be an immediate dirt magnet, I will pass on it next time."
4,I never thought I'd be a fan of burning books...,"...but this is a great idea. There's something theraputic about tearing out one of these pages of reflection, writing your troubles on it, and watching it go up in flames. Nicely done, although there's nothing wrong with saving the $$ and writing on your own paper."
3,"Read book, THEN burn it, learn from my mistake!","I made the fatal error of burning this book as soon as I got it in the mail (note: the packaging from Amazon is *highly* flammable). I did this in my front entryway which has a slate floor - lucky for me, I could have burned down the whole house! I later learned from a friend that there are actually things to read in the book (I assumed they were containing spells in another language). They really need to re-name the book, or add a warning on the cover, something like ""WARNING POUR SAND ALL OVER YOUR FRONT ENTRY WAY BEFORE YOU BURN THIS BOOK FOR REAL"""
1,the title was better than the read,I was expecting something out of the ordinary however I didn't get it. The book seems like it was written to make money and not to do anything in particular. Don't even buy this book
3,please help me !,please the one had orderd the (hannah montana forever) can till me if it's the full epsode or not and if it's not were can I found it ?????? and thanx :*
4,What's Real - keepin it real,"This book was quite enjoyable. What's Real couldn't top YO YO love but I still enjoyed it. The special twist at the end was the best - it was totally unexpected. What's Real kept you thinking about your own relationships. Daaimah kept it real with this book, page by page reality. I couldn't put the book down. I like the way one of the characters stood by her man - no matter what. The other character was very confused, but in the end got herself together. This book could use a sequel."
1,Beer for my horses,"I cannot do it, because I didn't got the CD - There was a damaged, empty bag in my mail-box."
1,Toby Keith is an A$$,"The last time Toby Keith played in my hometown, he acted like such a smug, thankless jerk that I don't care if I ever see him LIVE (in concert) again. And this lame CD further proves my point: It's a last-minute attempt to ca$h-in and TK's complete disregard for his fans is painfully evident with the half-hearted release of this garbage. Either way, I give the guy another year or two in the spotlight and then he'll be doing the state fair and rodeo circuit. Maybe he won't be such a big shot when he's playing in front of 150 people."
3,Greatest Hits????????????,"I still like Toby, but agree with others about the omission of the songs off of Shock'N Y'all. I was the one who was shocked when I saw the playlist. ""I Love This Bar"" is one of my favorites and I was amazed it was not on this disc. I guess he got an early start on Vol.III."
3,Something's Missing,"For the most part a good collection of Toby's hits since 2000.What I can't figure out is if this is supposed to be a greatest hits collection, why is a # 27 hit (Mockingbird) on this CD when THREE Number One Hits are missing?! (I Love This Bar, American Soldier & Whiskey Girl). Whoever compiled this CD should read Billboard>"
1,where are the hits?,I always like Toby's music but with only 8 albums out and one GH disc already where are all of the hits on this short CD. There are at least three songs off of his most current album which was released before this that are not on the GH disc. At least make it complete especially when you have room on the disc.
3,"Why no songs from ""Shock'n Y'all""?","I am a huge Toby Keith fan and will buy this CD regardless, but I am very disappointed that none of the hits from Shock'n Y'all are included in this CD. Having ""I Love This Bar"", ""Whisky Girl"", and ""American Soldier"" would have made this a much better collection of his greatest hits since the 1998 release of Greatest Hits One."
5,Awesome collection of his songs.,"If you're a Toby Keith fan, this disc is for you. What more can I say?"
1,Not original or enjoyable.,"Christmas has happened, and guess what someone gave me? This cd.Having listened to it just once, I find it to be pretty... lame. The style is played out, the sound is unorignal. I have never really heard more than one of his songs before, and I will try to keep it that way for the future now. I am sorry to his fans, but this was derivitive, and not even the enjoyable kind of derivitive.I will still write a nice thankyou letter, But the end result of it all is one more used CD available at my local Goodwill."
4,Great Xmas gift !!!,I think people believe that Toby is a good hearted redneck singer but he is a good writer of his own songs !! Not a pretty boy like Keith Urban -- he is man's man singer !!
1,One good song is NOT enough,All of the songs except for ONE are TRASH on this one. Not worth forking over even $.01 for this one!!!
3,I EXPECTED MORE...,"i bought this cd recently since i'm a new fan of country music, i used to hear lots of his songs in a country club/line dancing and i was kinda dissapointed, i thought only 3 songs were awesome.. didn't like the rest. but i guess most country fans loved this cd, so this is just my opinion :)"
2,Glad it was Cheap,"This CD was a complete disappointment. Had I paid full price for it, I would have demanded my money back. Recent hits were glaringly absent and, quite frankly, this CD needed them. The new songs are disappointing. I have his last four CDs, so I have all the songs on Greatest Hits 2 anyway. I just like to get the greatest hits so that I don't have to keep switching CDs in the car. Unless Toby comes up with something brilliant, this will be the last of his CDs I buy. Each one seems to be getting worse. Save your money for something better."
2,Just another sellout!!!!!!!,"Toby Keith's Greatest Hits Volume 1 was a very good cd. ""Blue Moon"" is still one of my favorite songs of all times. Since the release of that cd, Toby went to crap. Not only did he, along with other artists, benefit from the tragedy of 9/11 and the war, but he decided to tickle the little girls with an array of songs directed toward radio airplay instead of his early fans. I am still amazed by artists that claim that they were influenced by the likes of Merle, Hank Sr. and other greats, but their music goes the other way. Pop Country has no place in my cd collection and never will. To Toby and whomever views this...maybe you have it too good to write and perform the kind of country that true country artists do....maybe you need to smoke more weed with Willie. Where is my steel guitar?????"
5,A must have for Toby Keith fans.,"I am glad Toby finally release this Greatest Hits CD and I can listen to my favorite songs together on one CD plus three new songs. My all time favorite Toby song is ""How Do You Like Me Now?"". I love the ""Mockingbird"" song, its a great duet with his daughter Krystal. She definely inherited her dad's singing talent. She is an awesome singer like her dad. It would great if she could release a CD, I would definely buy it. I wasn't at all disappointed with this CD. But I do have to agree with others, I wish it had ""Whiskey Girl"" & ""I Love this Bar"" and other songs from his ""Shockin Ya'll"" CD."
5,His best CD yet,Every song on this cd is an expression of Toby Keith. He is not afaird to say or sing what he thinks. Great songs Love them all.
1,SAVE TOUR MONEY,Please save your money this one is not worth it. Toby has made a name for himself these last couple years with medicore songs that do not hold up. Great songwriter he is not. Could you see the greats like Merle Haggard and George Jones singing garbage like WHOSE YOUR DADDY or HOW DO YOU LIKE ME NOW. Take Toby for what he is a highly overrated singer/songwriter that cashed in on a patrotic theme after 9/11 and ran it. The new songs won't even go there except to say STAYS IN MEXICO is probadly the most sleazy piece of trash ever to hit country radio. The duet is very week stick to the orginial by James Taylor and Carly Simon.Money is tight so please save yours and use it on something that is worth it instead of this trash.
2,Somewhat boring collection,"While I like ""Ave Maria"" and ""Air"", I find that most of the rest of these songs leave me cold. I've tried listening to this CD late at night, and have found it useful as a sleeping aid. I really hate to be so negative about anything to do with Ivan Rebroff; I really think the fault is with me, or the music, and not Mr. Rebroff.Anyway, I would recommend only getting this if you like the music itself, regardless of who is singing it."
2,not a double ball bearing fan,"the fan was a single ball bearing + sleeve bearing, not double ball bearing.fans with sleeve bearings tend to fail much quicker than ball bearing fans."
3,Nada del Otro Mundo!!!,"Compre este ventilador por la fama que tiene Thermaltake; pero particularmente me parece que este ventilador no tiene mucha diferencia con los ventiladores ""genericos"" que generalmente vienen en los gabinetes (case) de las PC. Tiene poca fluidez de aire (air flow), bajo CFM e insuficiente presión de aire (air pressure). Respecto al ruido que éste genera a full velocidad, no es tanto como dicen en otros review. Me parece silencioso. La velocidad lo dice todo (2000 rpm aprox). En conclusión: Nada del otro mundo!!!."
5,It asks questions I don't have the courage to ask.,"The amazing capacity of Annie Dillard to bind together the seen and the unseen.. Wonderful sections, such as the one on Solutrean knives (""the size and thickness of a fillet of sole"") and the most beautiful description of an encounter with the holy I've ever read. (And what happens to those who feel it.) Also very funny. Highly recommended."
5,What a combination of topics and thoughts!,"Of course I believe Annie Dillard is a national treasure. I don't know anyone else's works I so frequently refer to and give as gifts. This one I gave to a friend recently returned from a first-time visit to China. She got to visit the army of ceramic men and horses that features prominently in Dillard's book. I never expected to see this juxtaposed with thoughts on Teilhard de Chardin and his falling in love; along with her reflections on children born with rare and life-threatening conditions, and so many other topics that Dillard seems effortlessly to have at her disposal. She does not answer the very deep and important questions she raises, but instead invites us to question with her. The experience is certainly rewarding. I finished this book with a sense of the fragility (and the terror) of life as well as its absolute blessing."
2,A real disappointment,"Annie Dillard is a tremendous writer, but this book is a real step down from her usual work. Please be warned: For The Time Being contains none of the usual wit or attention to detail that Dillard fans have come to expect. I suspect the enthusiastic praise this book is garnering comes from readers who are such rabid fans that they'll like anything Dillard signs her name to."
1,A Discursive Disappointment,"Professional and personal reviews had prepared me for some insight into matters commonly called ""weighty."" Ms. Dillard's text contravened these expectations. Her lambent tone [shading to exasperation far too frequently], the allusions that are both too long and too brief, and the attempt to balance polarities [agnosticism and belief] make for a unrewarding text. Readers interested in the dark night of the soul and some remedies for the angst it produces should consult all of Ernest Becker's, ""The Denial of Death,"" and not just the snippets Ms. Dillard presents. You'll be treated to a cohesive and demanding inquiry into substantial topics nicely adumbrated.It's always a disappointment when authors reach beyond their metier: ""Pilgrim"" is a wonderful exploration of nature's paradoxes. This present text can only make one wonder what personal daimon is driving Ms. Dillard."
5,Wonder-full,"I can't think of a better book to read following the events of September 11. Annie Dillard dignifies the living and the dead, and helps us put into perspective our precious and fragile moments on this earth."
4,a poetic excursion into philosophical theology,"I teach philosophy but respect the power of poetry and the story to provoke philosophical wonderment. Dillard's seemingly disconnected vignettes ask us to weave together our own experiences of individuality and generality and contemplate the paradox of evil and God. I agree with many other reviewers that this takes time to read and, most importantly, to reflect upon. It is a hybrid of many literary styles and as such, annoys or confuses some readers. We are a culture steeped in action and accumulation, not in reflection, meditation. Dillard offers us a vehicle by which to plummet our own beliefs, dogmas and souls."
5,A Real Step Up,"I've had this book in my hands since May, and still can't put it down after reading it several times through. I am an Annie Dillard fan, but not in love with everything she's written. Her attention to detail and her humor in this work is equal to or surpasses ""Teaching A Stone To Talk"" or ""Pilgrim"". Granted, it's a new style of writing, one that takes more time, but this is not a reason to quit trying, or to put others down for having the attention span to scale this mountain of thought. This is a daring work, an important work for those of us who have asked the hard questions in life and are not satisfied with what we've been handed so far. Give this book time and you'll be richly rewarded."
4,not a light read,"What i respect most about this work of Ms. Dillard is that she doesn't claim to know the answers to her questions, but she is asking them. This book made me think, laugh aloud and squirm uncomfortably in my seat. In today's black and white, commercial world, this book is like a breath of fresh air. There are answers to her questions, and this book gives an impetus to try to find them."
1,"A breezy, cluttered ramble","The thoughts are disjointed, the insights few. Ms. Dillard, whose Pilgrim at Tinker Creek was so wonderful, delivers just notes and whimsy here in ""For the Time Being."" Honestly, it read like a stoner's notebook. Maybe she was high while composing it. Her editor and publisher must have been, to take such a weak work to print."
1,Old woman rambling,"I think the Annie Dillard name is the sole reason for this ""book"" being published. I write the word ""book"" in quotes because to call this a book is more than a bit of a stretch. To me it reads like an old, senile person rambling nearly incoherently about things her mind has lost the ability to grasp for longer than a sentence or two. I can see only one very general theme come out of this - that people are a product of the earth. Why does it take 200+ pages to relate that no-longer-new theme? And relating the theme is all the book does - no explanation, no analysis of the theme, nothing beyond merely stating it in a very long-winded and oblique way. I hate to be so critical of this work, but I hope to save others the trouble of buying and reading this incoherent mess."
4,Dead Milkmen?,"You either love her or you hate her, and I love her. Welcome back to your home, Annie! We've missed you. It's been a long time since Teaching A Stone to Talk.""For the Time Being"" is the title of a long poem by W. H. Auden, conceived way back before television . ."
5,The Hindu View of Life - An introduction,"The Hindu View of Life, written as early as 1927, by one of the most outstanding Indian philosophers of the 20th century, professor Radhakrishnan is one of the best books on Hinduism I have ever read (and mind you, being a sociologist of religion, specializing in Hinduism and Islam I have read many...) It is learned and yet easy to grasp and understand, it shows you the multifaceted world of Hinduism, with an emphasis on Hinduism being there as monotheistic although God has many different names and appearences, it harbours a lot of references to different Western philosophers as well as politicians, it is (as opposed to so many other books I have read) short but extremely comprehensive and packed with substance and it is written in a beautiful language. Hence I fully recommend this book, whether it would be for studying Hinduism or for the pure satisfaction of reading good literature with a good content!"
5,bona floor cleaner,"Bona X Hardwood Floor cleaner is excellent and easy to use on hard wood floors. I have used it for about 9 years...Purchasing it in the gallon size is a good buy. You do not have to use it often unless you need to quick clean an area. Quick, easy and dries quickly."
4,Good Stuff,"This is a really good product. I've tried many hardwood floor cleaners & after researching to find a better one, I kept seeing Bona X pop up. Well, it lives up to its' name. No film is left behind and it works way better than anything else I've tried - and I've tried EVERYTHING."
2,Disappointing and dull,"I tried Bona floor cleaner and it left my hardwoods just plain dull. I had been using Perfect Kitchen from Bed Bath and Beyond (the dark blue bottle... they have several other cleaners) and wanted more shine, so tried Bona. Sorry but I'm back to the original Perfect Kitchen... it leaves a slight shine, no buildup, and not dull, flat. I'd recommend you try it.Works great on our oak kitchen table, too.Would welcome other suggestions, but suspect we'll need to have floors redone and just will go with semigloss or gloss, but for now I'm back to perfect kitchen."
5,Great Product! ATTN Big Dog Lovers!,"The previous owner of our 2-year old house recommended Bona for our hardwood floors. I had never heard of this brand until she told me about it. In my old house I had always used the types of wood floor cleaners you get in grocery stores, such as Murphy's Oil, Orange Glo, etc. I always had to use a lot of elbow grease to get the stubborn dirt up using these products, and the finish ended up looking a little dull, too. If you've ever had a big dog, you'll know that dog drool is one of the hardest things to get off a surface. Bona is probably the best cleaner I've used so far for hardwoods and getting the spots of dried dog drool off that I missed when they were wet! It won't dull your floors and really does get the ground in dirt out with less toil. I use the spray bottle as well."
2,Good cleaning but dull...,I just unpacked and tried this product. It cleaned the floor well but all the satin sheen of the verathane finish is gone!!! The floor now looks like a flat finish. I guess that's why they offer the re-finishing product. You have to buy that to get your floors back to their original finish.
1,"Streaky, Smeared, Dull, UGLY!","What a smeared, dull, ugly mess! At the advice of many, I purchased Bona Floor Cleaner. Just finished using it according to directions & my floors are worse than before I used it: streaky, dull, and all smeared. What do I do now? This is a disaster! My beautiful, shiny floors look absolutely horrible! If I were an attorney, I'd sue them. How can anyone recommend this horrible product?"
2,below average product,"This product can easily be replaced by other mild cleaning products for your hardwood floors. It seems like watered down windex and mild dish soap in a spray bottle could replace it.On the other hand, the REPLENISHER offered by Bona is a fanatasic product to refresh the luster and shine to your hardwood floors."
5,Happy Cleaning Ladies,My cleaning ladies commented that this is the best product for our Bruce hardwood floors. I didn't ask them. They were impressed with the applicator and product and mentioned it to my wife. I will be buying this again.
1,Read the MSDS sheet!,I was going to order this until I found that it is damaging to aquatic life and SHOULD NOT enter the drain... So HOW exactly do you wash and rinse out the mop without it getting into our water system?? We are killing ourselves with what we are doing to the world and the chemicals we are dumping on it... I also would not want my bare feet contacting the residue from this product either... I am trying to find a natural option if there is one to be had.[...]
3,Overpriced cleaner,"Had to work pretty hard to get this product to bring a shine it does, however Murphy's oil soap did just as good a job for a whole lot less"
5,Great wood cleaner,"I have hardwood floors throughout my home and have used this cleaner for the past 4 years. It does a fantastic job without any damage to your floors. I use one of the Bona spray bottles because they are made to deliver a fine mist so you don't soak your floor with a microfiber mop. It dries quickly, making it easy to clean quickly right before guests arrive. This cleaner also works great if you have pets who sometimes leave a little dirt on the floor or saliva marks from playing with toys. It also works well on the black marks that rubber soles can leave on your floor. I wouldn't use anything else on my floors."
5,This Stuff is Awesome,I've tried quite a few hardwood floor cleaners and this is by far the best. It goes on easy and wipes off leaving the natural beauty of the floor shine through. Getting it in the large size at Amazon makes it relatively inexpensive to use as well. Highly recommend.
2,Meh,"I'm not impressed. For the price, I expected my floors to shine like the Gilded Mansions, but when I compared the section of my floor that I'd cleaned with Bona side-to-side with the section on which I'd applied Murphy's Oil Soap, the Murphy's won handily. Bona left my floor with a dull matte finish, and I had to re-clean with the Murphy's to restore its shine. I'd rather spend $3 at my local store for something that works much better than this junk."
1,Customer Service - shipping nightmare,The company who provides this product has terrible customer service. My order was damaged in shipment and until I called them they weren't in the process of sending a replacement. I've been talking to them for almost a week and they still haven't sent the replacement items but of course I was billed at the first shipment. I won't order this product from them again.
5,Excellent,"Great purchase, floors are beautiful, no ridiculous smell, no streaking or hazing either. Highly recommend. Floors get better and better after each use!"
4,Bona was recommended,This product was recommended by the contractor that installed my bamboo flooring. It works ok but I don't feel that it gets the floor as clean as a mop and mop bucket. I also wish it came in other fragrances.
3,Cleans but dont expect shine,"Based on the microfiber pad I used it cleaned my wood floors very well. But there is not extra shine as you expect with some of the reviews. Most likely you do have to use the polish by the same company, which is understandable. Again some of the reviews make you believe the cleaner will give you that great shine, but its really doesnt.Plus rinse the pad often or you will get that cloudy film. I got the spray and purchased at ACE hardware (they are great!) in my home town.All in all, 3 stars."
4,Not for waxed floors,"I could not find the following information except once I held the bottle in my hand. So beware to all prospective buyers: While this product appears to be excellent, it is NOT for waxed floors. Know this now, and avoid returning it later."
5,Never Changing,"I had a laminate floor installed several months ago. The floor marks easily and even gets little scratches on it from the dogs nails. I had my floor guy come out thinking I would replace a badly marked piece with one left over, and he said ""before we go to all that trouble, lets try this"" and wet a rag with Bona and wiped it. Presto, the marks were gone. When I clean the floor with this product it looks brand new - clean and shiny. I can't imaging what is going on with folks that say it leaves a film, certainly not on my floor! (though, if my mop get dirty and and don't rinse or change soon enough, there will be little lines of dirt/film that the product has obviously raised and gathered on the mop - so maybe their floor was really dirty?) I actually look forward to floor cleaning now because it looks so nice when I'm done (can't believe I said that). I highly recommend it - I buy it by the gallon. Hope it works for you too."
2,floor cleaner,"put a dull finish on the floor and I want a shinier look on my hardwood, so for that reason I was not totally pleased"
1,Disappointed,"We had a gorgeous new dark maple hardwood floor installed in our bedroom about 2 years ago and have been using Bona exclusively. Just spent all Sunday afternoon using hot water and ammonia trying to get the dull buildup off our once beautiful floor. The floor retailer is trying to tell me I was using only ""Bona"" not "" Bona Professonal"" that's why the floor is dull. Searching the web now for a better hardwood floor cleaner that won't leave a dull finish."
2,Good for a day or two,"I used this product to ""clean"" our bamboo floors. The floor looked great until it got walked on, and now it has an oily, milky look to it. It may work better on an oak or rougher-finished floor, but I would definitely NOT recommend it for bamboo."
5,Recommended by the floor refinisher,Product does a great job of maintaining the finish of hardwood floors. Used once every 2 weeks it keeps the shine and protects the finish.
1,Not helpfull,My Mitsubishi Technica engine dit'n apear in the book. At least not the Puerto Rico Technica version.
1,itsubishi- Galant/Mirage/Diamante 1990-00,"I returned this book after reviewing it briefly. I have used other books from Chiltons that I have found useful. I am a picture/symbol oriented person when it comes to auto repairs. I am a DIY guy, not a mechanic, so I need to see how it looks in the manual. The schmatics/diagrams/pictures in this manual are 1.5"" x 1.5"". At this size they are totally useless. I cannot even compare this manual to the Chilton's I use to repair my '93 Plymouth minivan. It's like they were written by two diffent publishers."
2,Maybe if you're already a mechanic,"If you don't already have a reasonable amount of auto mechanic experience under your belt, or have a friend who does, this book will probably not help you much. Some of the diagrams are sketchy (""Where on the engine is that? Does my car have one of those?"") and the procedure descriptions are terse and assume you can work out the details for yourself. For example, they will say ""remove the electrical connector"" instead of ""remove the electrical connector by doing ..."". I've owned, had repair manuals for, and worked on three cars (including the mirage) and a motorcycle, but I still found the lack of detail made things take longer than they should. I would liken it to a cook book - if you already know how to cook, and can improvise a bit in the kitchen, a cook book is great, but if you've never cooked before maybe you should consider going out to eat."

1,Song list on CD is different than what Amazon shows!,"I like a lot of these songs, but I purchased the CD for some of the songs that Amazon shows as being on the disc that aren't. Either Amazon copied the song list from the LP version of ""Original Masters"" or the CD has been changed.The actual CD track list is (1) Sir James the Rose (2) Black Jack Davy (3) All Around My Hat (4) The Wife of Ushers Well (5) Fighting for Strangers (6) Thomas the Rhymer (7) Seven Hundred Elves (8) Long Lankin (9) Elf Call (Disc Two)(1) Cam Ye O'Er Frae France (2) Bonny Morhen (3) Alison Gross (4) The Mooncoin Jig (5) Drink Down the Moon (6) Skewball (7) Lovely on the Water (8) Jigs: The Bride's Favorites/Tansey's Fancy (9) One Misty Moisty Moorning (10) Saucy Sailor (11) Gaudete."
3,Humayun Ali,This book has a beautiful starting and amazing ending.In the begining of the book Mr. Plummer talks about how the psycology of investors as a whole can effect the financial market. At the end he talks about few strategies to adopt as an investor. The middle of the book explains different concepts of technical anaysis which is not very impressive. It is a good book but their are better books available on technical analysis. Well i had time and read the whole book on the train while going to work every morning.
1,For academics only,"It's conceivable that some scholarly professor living in some dimly-lit library on some hermetically-sealed university campus will be able to decipher this jargon-filled tome. For the rest of us, this book is a virtually unreadable barrage of dry, dismal, academic slang without even a single moment of levity. It's two-hundred-plus pages of ""crucial cultural intertexts"" and ""structural homology"" and ""strucural displacement"" -- and those three phrases came from ONE SENTENCE on page four!How is it possible to write a book about Bollywood that is so utterly devoid of color and joy? The author has accomplished exactly that. It could be that this book might contain a few tangible ideas or meaningful illuminations, but they're buried so deeply under the weight of such pompous verbage that they'll never see the light of day. Bollywood has never been so tediously presented!"
3,Not a good description of model fits,"Not a good description of model fits, I got lucky and had to do some modification to make it work. The Price was right but it should tell what models it would fit on."
3,"Warm, passionate singer","Nothing earth-shattering about this middle-aged 90s soul singer, but he delivers a competent set of soul ballads including the sweet ""All These Things."""
3,A little more suspense,"The classic take on what happens when people get greedy. Yeah, the movie is for the most part predictable and somewhat cliche ridden. Overall, it's not the worst movie I've seen. Good flick on a rainy day or night when nothing else is on. While it may not overwhelm you with it's storyline you at least will be entertained.....and then go on about your business!"
2,Amazingly Awful Script,"While the script of this movie is so full of holes that it becomes laughable, the movie does have minimal entertainment value because some of the acting and action sequences are decent. And in fact, the underlying ""story"" is so mindless, so shallow, and so amateurish, that these aspects become entertaining in themselves, in the ""so bad that it's good"" manner, reminiscent of the old Mystery Science Theatre 3000 shows. So I guess if you approach this film with low or no expectations, you will get some enjoyment out of it."
2,"""Armored"" is predictable with the best part being Peter Petrelli sensing danger from the chili dog stand","Length:: 6:37 MinsGina from Haunted Flower reviews the movie ""Armored"", starring Matt Dillon, Lawrence Fishburne, Skeet Ulrich, Jean Reno, and Columbus Short. An armored car heist goes wrong.[...]"
2,We need armored protection from Hollywood stupidity,"I had moderate expectations for this by-the-numbers heist flick. I really like the cast, and was begging for some predictable but action packed entertainment. Is that too much to ask?Apparently so. This starts off fairly strong, as the group plan their act. Of course nothing goes smoothly in the life of crime.When people are placed in stressful situations, they inevitably are going to panic and make foolish decisions. I totally understand that. But this has some of the most ludicrous, incomprehensible moments that defy any sense of logic. Moments that would not even be attempted in a freakin dream! It completely undermines the entire story. Your brain does not turn that far off. As long as people accept this kind of silly junk from Hollywood they are gonna keep dishing it out. Please stop!Say no to stupidity."
2,NOTHING NEW WITH THIS ONE,"A tale of a heist gone wrong with themes that if you want too much money in your life, well, you get the idea. It's a basic tale with few surprises even if the cast is more than I thought it would be. The biggest problem with this film is that if you've seen one or two of these types of films you won't be in for anything new. The characters are done better than the tale. This film cost about $20M to make and yielded a similar amount at the Box Office. STORY/PLOTTING: C to C plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; THEMES OF GREED: C to C plus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus;WHEN WATCHED: end of December 2011."
2,So much talent...,"so little joy. The cast is loaded. The plot falls apart, fast. The viewer can bemoan the waste."
3,"""Nobody gets hurt""",A real classy visual treat of testosterone packed heist action flick. Dilon is still dirty hot and Ulrich brings his emotional side at best.
4,Armored,"""Armored"" is a kind of different story. This group of guards in armored trucks decide to still millions of dollars from the money they are hauling and hide it for later. But as can be expected, everything that can goes wrong. So the results are tragic.I recommend it to fans of crime dramas."
5,Armored,"I saw a preview on another movie so I bought it and I was glad I did. Lots of action and suspense all great actors and edge of your seat kinda film. It funny how movies you never see and get you either enjoy them or you don't. Great movie and excellent condition, fast service."
4,Is there honor among thieves?,"This movie might have you asking that question. Quite suspenseful and interesting film that should keep your attention to the end. The PG-13 rating is stretched very thin in my opinion but not an overly violent or abusive language movie. Matt Dillon brings quite a bit to it as well and have not seen a movie yet with him in it I didn't like. The storyline I thought was well written and there we some parts that did touch me personally. Overall, pretty decent movie that is good enough to see at least once.Peter J. Miller"
4,"You want graphic? Well, this it","This movie is about a military veteran and his struggles to pay his mortgage and take care of his little brother after their parents died. So his friend/co-worker comes up with this idea about basically stealing the very money they protect while transporting it. He was reluctant, but as long as ""no one got hurt"", he would go along. After all, as his friend suggested, there were no ""bad guys"" involved. Everything was fine until they spotted a homeless man in the abandoned building where they planned to stash the money. One of the men kills him, and the story turns wild from there...................."
3,Light Rainy Day Fare,"Yes, most of this film is predictable, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun to watch anyway. Good cast, and some nice action.... great for some rainy day entrainment."
3,It's ok for a rainy night or so... (like Silkey suggests),"I agree with the review by Silkey. Just writing this review to put my rating on it (3 stars). In addition to what Silkey writes,... it's very good acting, by experienced actors, and also new actors. The set is als very good. The bonus features on the DVD provides info on how the movie was made, the story, the set ect."
5,A kitten care guide book for young children,This is an excellent book for young readers. It gives good information and is an excellent guide for young cat owners.
3,Really wanted this too work... don't recommend,"This would have been perfect if it was a little better quality.Board was really thin and unfortunately parts of the outer surface were separated and damaged. I would not buy from them again, I did read the bad reviews beforehand so its my own fault.It wasn't a total loss my daughter has decided to duct tape it into submission so it is usable."
3,"Very Nice Lap Desk, BUT...",I was disappointed with this desk because my laptops's optical mouse cannot work with the high gloss varnish on the destop.
3,Lounge chair desk,This is my second lap desk. My first one was just the right fit. Used it for 6 years. Saw this new one so bought it. Was rather disappointed as it is way wider than needed and just doesn't work. It needs to go over the arms of my recliner and is just too wide for comfortable use.
2,Very thin wood,"I was greatly disappointed in this product. The wood is very thing, it bows when a laptop is placed on it. Might be good for writing, but not for laptop computing."
1,Bends easily and has sharp edges,"I wanted to use this product for my wireless keyboard and mouse while sitting in the recliner.Incredibly, just the weight of the keyboard, a mousepad, and a mouse are enough to warp the board so the keyboard actually bounces as you type (because it is not touching the surface on all corners). There is no comfortable way to use the mouse because of the sharp edges digging into your arm. In addition the cutouts for carrying the board around are in the worst possible place, taking away a lot (LOT!) of useful space on the surface.I tried using this for a writing surface while sitting on a couch, and encountered exactly the same problems.This product is useless to me.With these modifications it would be very useful:* Thicker, so it doesn't bend so easily.* Round off those sharp edges!* Cut-out for carrying at TOP, not on BOTH SIDES."
3,Lap board,"This item was ok, the reason for this is the lap board is flimsy It's not a sturdy board so If your looking for something sturdier I wouldn't get this product."
4,Product is awesome. Condition when received not so much,"I have one of these lap desks and I love it. It's great for taking care of business while watching TV.Upon receipt though, this one was damaged. It was crushed on one side. It didn't make it unusable, but not a good thing as it was a gift delivered to someone.Based on the description it was the only one available. I expect that makes replacing it pretty much out of the question..."
3,origins of a great talent,"Chris Hillman has had a great career beginning with the Byrds and continuing through to today. He is a very good mandolin player and singer.The SSBs are where he began to be heard on vinyl. The group is tight, the songs are traditional, the licks are good. 10 songs - only 18 minutes.A mix of instrumentals and vocals. Not quite up to the Dillards level. Get his two solo albums if you want to hear his progression."
4,"Hi performance, fairly noisy",I used this Thermaltake fan for a while then changed it for a lower volume fan to reduce noise. It was unobstructed by a grille so it wasn't noise from turbulence just a whine. It moves a lot of air if that's what you need.
4,Complete album,"I was very satisfied when I heard this CD before its release on BET's website that I can not wait till the album drops. The beats and her vocals go well together and whoever was on her writing team deserves a pat on the back. My favorites are not even the ones she has the videos to. Granted, those are nice tracks but she has better bangers on the album. My favs are 'love', 'you've changed' which samples 'song cry' by jay'z....not sure if that was a sample too, but she does a good jaguar wright, 'situations,' and 'thought you had my back.' Overall this is a complete album because you can let it play without skipping to the next track. I'd have to say that I was pretty satisfied."
5,Keyshia Has Talent & Came At Perfect Timing!,"At time when more talented artists are becoming way more popular and music is being based on talent and talenteed artists are infuising dance/r&b;/hip-hop/pop together, Keyshia came at the right time. Keyshia has an amazing voice/singing, songwriting, and music/vocal arranging ability. This actually may be her second single (type in Keyshia Cole on Popular Music) and it is doing very well. All ready the #1 most played single on the urban stations, she is climbing the charts in a very big way & making a huge impact. The song is very emotional and particulary, but not fully similar to Willa Ford's--""Did Ya` Understand That."" Her new single--""I Should've Cheated"" is also slowly becoming a big hit! At a time when super talented musicians/actors who will be in the music industry forever, really famous forever, and most likely super rule 2005 (Willa, Lyndsay, Christina M., etc.), talented Keyshia has made the right move perfectly!!-Happy Holidays & God Bless"
3,Works,"I need to be able to take items out to the harvest field and this works. The zipper is hard to work, wish the were not so expensive, but all in all it does what it needs to."
1,I have not recieved my book yet. where is my money please,"I have not received my book yet. If its not avialable, please can I get my money back?"
2,Doesn't grip items at all and is too light weight.,I bought this to use with a mini drill press. The clamp is too light weight and does not grip what I am working with. It is useless for my needs and I will return it -unless the shipping is more than the item cost!
4,A little red resource,"I picked this book up in the bargain bin section of my local bookstore and for a mere few dollars and a sincere desire to improve my writing, it was an easy purchase. This contains a lot of useful information in an easily digestible format. Each chapter is only a few pages but it packs excessive information. I also enjoy the quotations that are found throughout the book. It also contains little exercise's to help hone the ideas of the topic being discussed, with the answers found on the last few pages. Having already completed my English requirements for college and as a student of life this little resource book will definitely be useful for the future. I recommend this book to the same crowd the author speaks to on the back cover, ""for writers from all walks of life."""
4,It's more suitable for students,"Personally, I was looking for a writing guide to improve my writing for novels. It isn't that much help in that aspect.But it's a great reference for students who are looking to improve their essays in school or for working adults who need to write reports."
3,"Simple, Straightforward, Politically Astute","This is a pretty simple and straightforward book that would be useful for a novice or part-time writer (such as somebody just trying to write a more formal communication for a corporate environment and isn't looking to be the next Tolstoy or Joyce). You'll even learn how to be 'politcally astute' in the section named ""Keep Your Writing Gender Neutral."" (The book calls it 'politically astute', but pretty much everyone else would write 'politically correct', of course.)All in all, this book is okay, but nothing to write home to momma -- err, 'parent' about...."
5,Working Great,"We've tried several other collars to get our hound dog to stop barking, especially when she is on a ""sniff"", but we've had to return the others as they did not work well. The PetSafe Deluxe Bark Collar has worked out very well, and has significantly curbed her barking. And the great thing is that we can turn it off so the battery is not wasted. Plus the three levels help to control her. Definitely recommend it."
4,closure/clasp looked different from photo,"Judging from the photo on line, the clasp/closure on the collar appeared to be a snap type and not a buckle. That was the reason for the purchase of another collar. Upon arrival in the mail, I discovered it was not the snap in kind but just another one with a buckle. It does not seem as secure and the loop that is suppose to hold the remainder of the collar in place is flimsy. Always needs adjustmnets.Would like to see better close ups of the item or detailed discriptions listed with item before purchasing.The collar itself is very efficient."
4,live saver,"the collars have controled the barking of my dogs, they learned that when they bark they get zapped and so they have been retrained not to bark constantly."
4,The only one for my dogs..,"I have three Jack Russell Terriers, and one of them is a bark-0-maniac. This is the second PDBC-300 I've used with her - the first was stolen at the dog park.. She wore it with the battery turned on just twice. Both times, her correction level was very low, and she seemed more surprised by the electric interaction than she was in discomfort.After those initial wearings, I put the collar on, minus the battery. She didn't mind it on her neck, instantly stopped the barking, and now never begins the racket if I just show it to her.My newest rescued Jack has sporadic barking episodes, and I plan to use the collar with him, if it continues, when he's settled in and no longer apprehensive about his status in the pack/household. When it's time, I'm confident that the correction won't be too severe, based on past use.Many bark collars really jolt the dog, and that's not OK with me, but this one works, period."
3,Can't Be Used Outside,"I have a golden retriver mix who likes to bark at people walking by the house, inside and out. When I had the collar on her outside, all of a sudden she would yelp because she was being corrected by the collar. Found out that the wind was setting it off by blowing over the microphone. So this collar cannot be used outside. I don't want to take the chance of her being corrected if she hasn't done anything wrong."
3,"Great anti-bark mechanism, horrible cheap collar","For the price, you would think the collar and collar clasp would be at least average quality. The anti-bark box is great, as long as you can keep it on your dog. Every time we put it on our dog, at some point it falls off, whether he shakes, walks to the kitchen, or just stands there, it's bound to fall off his neck. We have almost lost it several times to rain in the backyard (we luckily notice each time it starts raining that it's missing and grab it from outside before it gets ruined). I recommend getting this for the anti-bark and figuring out a way to attach it to a decent collar. But then again, for the price, I'm not sure it's worth that much effort."
4,Worked for the beagle / foxhound,Our dog would constantly bark at squirrels birds and people. It only took about 10 minutes for him to learn not to bark. The band itself is crap.
3,The verdict is still out,"I'm having trouble getting this collar to stay in place, so I'm really not sure it will ultimately serve it's purpose. The company sent me a different style of collar to try, but every time the dog shakes his head, the contact points move out of place. The company said I need to make it tighter and to make sure I put it on when he is standing up...I've done both. I simply can't make the collar any tighter as it's already a struggle to snap it shut as it is. I'll give it a few more tries, but I have my doubts as to how useful it will be."
3,bark control,"I purchased the automatic bark control collar and it worked as advertised for the first two weeks. It then stopped working for no apparent reason.I called the company and they agreed to replace it free of charge.I have read others comments on this brand of collar with similar results, I was hoping it was a fluke, I guess its a definate issue."
2,good for very short time,The batteries don't last very long and are expensive to keep replacing and the collar itself stopped working all the time after about 6 months. It will work sporadically but I need it at all times for my cocker that just doesn't get that he isn't suppose to bark all day long and at everything! Very disappointed in them as I bought two for both dogs and now I am out that money and have to look for a different kind that WILL work!
5,AHhh! Silence.,"""Jack, Shut up!"" This one starts barking about an hour before we get up in the morning. ""Turkey, quiet!"" This one barks for half an hour before their evening meal and at anything that moves outside. Keep saying either or both of these every few minutes until you buy this collar.We have 7 dogs. This is the fourth one of this exact collar we bought. Sometimes we have to use all four. The collar is lightweight. Dogs can eat and sleep with it on, if necessary. It can be adjusted to our 15 lb. Jack Russel and there is still collar left over when it is on our 51 lb. mixed breed. He even comes over to have it put on when he sees me get it out. Batteries are easy to find (online) and replace."
2,Cheap Collar,Bought this collar about 6 months ago. Worked well with my Weimaraner. He didn't bark but he could still whine which wasn't as annoying to the neighbor's. The collar just broke. The plastic is very cheap and the collar itself is cheap. Would have liked a better made collar. Now I am looking to purchase a new one maybe made of a heavier material and no plastic attachments.
4,It Works!,"Totally works for our howling Redbone Coonhound! Amazing! She just chills out now in the front lawn when the FedEx truck, mail truck or dogs go by our house. Our neighbors are very pleased. I rated it 4 stars because the collar (not the shock part) that came with ours was terrible and the metal buckle fell apart after 3 days of wearing it. Went to PetsMart and found an updated PetSafe collar and replaced it and it works great."
4,Dog got the point at once. Works great. Battery last ~3 months.,"My dog barked once with this thing on, got a mild shock, and he didn't bark again for weeks. He is quiet at nights and doesn't even bark at our cats any more. He's been wearing it for 4 weeks and has only barked again when another dog came up to him barking and growling and again when someone came to the door late one night. Both times, the collar quited him down after 2 barks, but he did yelp very loudly after the second bark.If you don't want your dog in pain, dial down initial sensitivity of the device, that way there will be less violent shocks before a truly painful one.I took one star off due to the propietary battery. The battery did last about 3 months of continuous use.The dog doesn't even notice the collar any more and when the battery ran out and we took the collar off until the replacement battery arrived, he still wouldn't bark. I am sure my neighbors and cats greatly appreciate this little device."
2,Works Great! Then the battery died.,"This was great, but the battery died in less than a month. No problem . . . I bought the replacement batteries ~ that don't even work!"
4,Worked immediately!,"I bought this for our little Shih Tzu when the neighbors started calling about her very early morning barking. I was very worried that this would hurt her or frighten her but we had tried everything else. I set it on the lowest setting and put it on her. She started to bark and then immediately stopped. She barked once more and that was it. After that first time, I never turned it on again, simply putting it on was enough of a reminder."
1,Bark control collar-NOT RECEIVED,To date I have neither received this product nor have I received a credit to my amazon account I have advised seller but have not received satisfaction.
3,"Good product, battery almost dead","I have used another PetSafe bark control collar in the past, not the deluxe version, and they work great. Purchased this one and had a heck of time getting it to work. Found out the battery was about dead. If it wasn't for the battery I would have rated this a 5 star item."
2,Limited use,"I don't know if my dogs are too smart or too dumb but this product only has limited use for us. It does work in the sense that while they are wearing it they don't bark. As soon as you take it off and a noise comes from behind the fence or someone walks by out front, they are back to barking their heads off. They have only learned not to bark while the collars are actually on. I can't leave this thing on them 24/7. I have tried this shock collar and the citrus spray collars with exactly the same results. One of my dogs is a border collie and the other an australian shepherd. I will have to research other methods of bark control and not leave it to devices."
3,Bark Collar,"I'm not completely pleased with the product as yet. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. I will continue to work with it and my dog. I cannot honestly say whether it's worth the investment or not."
1,Doesn't Work at All,"I purchased a bark collar made by PetSafe - one of the cheaper ones. It didn't work at all - gave some sort of beep which did not have any effect on the dog. So I mistakenly purchased a more expensive PetSafe model, thinking it would be better. It wasn't. Based upon my experience, these PetSafe collars are junk and a waste of money."
1,Didn't work at all,"Only so much user error could account for this product working sporadically, if at all. A complete waste of money."
3,"Good concept, but...",The collar does not work very well for my dogs. Most of the time it does not perform the correction when they bark.
1,wrong item in box,"We ordered an RBC300 and received a box marked RBC300, however the item inside the box was an RBC100 - a much older model with a metal clasp instead of just the plastic clasp. We have returned this item and put a post it note on the box that the wrong item is in the box. I don't know if this is Amazon's error or Petsafe's."
1,BE CAREFUL. THEY ARE GIVING YOU MISLEADING INFORMATION.,"The AMAZON.COM PRODUCT INFORMATION clearly states that the collar adjusts from 6"" to 28"". But when you get the product it clearly states adjusts from 8"" to 28"". The product information states it is perfect for all breeds small and large, yet the box states for dogs 8 pounds and over. Now tell me why they wouldn't tell you this ANYWHERE in the product information section BEFORE YOU BUY IT??? Don't you think it would be smart to state this for us small dogs owners withyappy dogs looking for relief that it is not suitable for dogs under 8 pounds. Yorkies are typically under 8 pounds??I believe the product information should be changed to indicate what the manufacturer tells us right on the outside of the box the collar comes in."
4,Petsafe Bark Collar,"Collar is easy to use and effective. However, it would be great if the collar portion could be updated!"
2,They Ruined a Good Product,"I have three Petsafe collars that I have had for 3 years or so. They have worked very well, until recently, and are starting to fail. But they have been used a lot on large active dogs outdoors, so I am happy with the service life. That's why I decided to buy another one.This new collar seemed like a great improvement to the original models when I read the info on Amazon's web site, and in some ways it is. But the very poor collar design that supports the control box renders it horrible. It has both a clasp and a clip, which is a total pain in the a** to put on the dogs. The new clip isn't strong enough to stay connected on its own, and the clasp is a pain to use. It worked fine in its original form, so why did they change it? I will be buying a collar with a good plastic clip and remounting it.You can turn it off, and adjust the power level, both of which are nice improvements, but ...."
5,Lab Pup Barking Cure,"My Lab pup was barking from 4:30 AM to 5:30 AM every day...non-stop. Got the collar and set it on the lowest setting...the barking stopped. Now I sleep until 6:30 AM and then get up, take off the collar and give the dogs their outside time. It was well worth the money for the collar. A few weeks after I got the collar, Amazon emailed me an offer for cheap replacement batteries and I bought them. I haven't had to use the replacement batteries yet and it has been a month."
5,Lots of laughs - great present for the Minister!,This was a great book to give as a gift. It is full of laughs and hard to put down. It helps you to start looking for the humor in everyday occurances. The illustrations were great. Looking forward to more from this author.
2,what's wrong with contentment,"This author is a prolific scholar in his field, but I stopped reading when he began to argue that contentment and tranquility were goals unworthy of human beings because such deny their God-given skillful brain. In a book about spirituality, I was most seeking a route to contentment and tranquility -- what a disappointment to be told I was on the wrong path!"
1,The Wrech of the Zanzibar,"The Wreck of the ZanzibarThe Wreck of the Zanzibar takes place in the Scilly Isles,1907. Laura Perryman is the main character. She has a diary. Its not an everyday diary, she just writes down the good and bad events. Laura has a big twin brother named Billy. Later-on in the book Billy sails away with a man named Joseph Hannibal, to be a cabin boy on the General Lee. This is all because of a row with his father.There is a massive storm and all the cows drown!This means no more milk or food!There is another big storm and their are forced to leave Scilly."
2,For trivia buffs only,"Isaac Asimov is unquestionably one of the greatest science fiction writers of the 20th century. Unfortunately, his attempts at writing mysteries did not produce the same quality of work as his efforts in SF. TALES OF THE BLACK WIDOWERS demonstrates this with puzzle after puzzle that requires knowledge of trivia (the references are sometimes painfully obscure) rather than logical deduction to solve. Trivial Pursuit players might enjoy these stories but fans of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie should pass on them."
4,Excellent young New Orleans trumpet player,"James Andrews plays and sings Satchmo style on the CD, which is superbly produced by Allen Toussaint. Both Allen Toussaint and Dr. John are on every track. James comes from a musical family in the Treme neighborhood of New Orleans, where brass bands still march through the streets. His talent shines through on this CD. If you have the opportunity to hear him live, ask him why his nickname is ""12."" -- Billy from New Orleans"
1,Poor Customer service,"I received the product timely however when I put it on the wall, the LCD display was only partially visible. When put on the wall it does not completely display the numbers so it is basically unreadable. We tried new batteries but that did nothing to improve it. We called the seller and a recording told us they had our ID and number and would respond. I also sent an email the same day and never received either an email reply nor a call from the seller. This has been going on since Dec 15 2008. I'll try once more to contact them. If no reply I will return it and ask for a refund. Good idea, just couldn't get it to work and apparently Customer Service doesn't care about their customers."
1,not worth buying,The readings between the base and remote differ so much that you can't decide which to accept as true! I set them side by side and got a diff. in temp. about 2 deg. but the humidity was about 10 deg. off!!
1,Not accurate. Don't buy it,"As one guy already noted in one of the images, the readings of the main unit and the remote differ. Add to that the cheap plastic, funny manual, the remote that does not switch to Celsius (the switch does not respond) and the price...Bottom line - don't buy it."
3,Honeywell Thermo-Hygrometer dissapointing,"Had to return the first unit I received because the Humidity readings on the Main Unit were way below actual readings by about 20%. The second unit shipped to me was better, but the Main Unit still reads ~10% lower than the remote unit and another Hygrometer I have had for awhile and trust to be accurate. The Remote Units seemed to be accurate for both Humidity and Temperature readings. The Main Unit's Temperature readings were accurate both times."
2,Photos and Description Are Misleading,"This is a relatively inexpensive unit, and I wouldn't expect it to be completely accurate. The tolerances advertises of 0.1 F and 1% RH seem reasonable enough.I feel a bit misled by the photos and description. They both refer to a temperature and humidity ""trend icon"" which is conspicuously absent in the unit I received. This may be a trivial fact to most consumers, but it is in fact one of the reasons I chose this product. I can see how Amazon could overlook something like this, but now that they know, they should correct their advertised information."
2,Didn't Last Long,"This item worked great for about 3 months. Then it lost the signal from the remote sender. Replacing the batteries and fiddling around with it did no good, now it will not even pick up the signal with the sender in the same room."
4,Easy to See and Use,"This unit has a sensor built in and comes with an additional remote sensor. I bought two additional remote sensors, so now I can tell the temp and humidity on two floors, in the garage and outside, all wirelessly. The numbers are big and the interface is as simple as it gets.I haven't used it to track peak and trough, so I'm not sure how that works, but it would be nice if it had a built in clock to stamp those data with."
1,Doesn't work with remote.,"While the temperature and humidity seem to be accurate, I could not get the remote unit to transmit, no matter what I did. I would return it, but it's too much trouble"
4,Helpful device,"This is a very useful device, and seems quite accurate. Our bedroom is on the second floor, and it is sometimes hard to know how to dress when the outside temperature is changing. We keep the sensor on our front window sill, and the display lets us know what outside temperature to prepare for. Its only flaw is that it doesn't have a light for the display, so on dark winter mornings, or when I wake in a winter night and worry that our pipes may be freezing, I have to turn on a light to read the display."
1,Total dud,Senor lost connection every 4 -6 hours (even less then 10 feet away). You have to unscrew the back and take the batteries out every time to reset. A total design failure in my opinion. Sent it back after 1 week of total frustration!
4,Looks good next to my iMac,"I got this primarily to get a reading for the outside temp. It has a separate, wireless monitor that I placed outside my window (between the window and the screen). Interestingly, I find that I use it just as often to check the indoor humidity. Because I live in an apartment, it oftentimes gets dry in the winter, so if I see it falls below 40% humidity (the device shows a little frown face), then I run my humidifier. The design is also neat and simple, and looks similar to my iMac. Only feature missing is backlight."
2,Inaccurate,"I bought this and an extra wireless unit. None of them are accurate, I can put all three right next to each other and they all give drastically different readings (up to a 10% delta in temp and humidity). Example, one will read 55% Humidity, another 50%, the last 45%. Same kind of delta w/ temp.If they were accurate I would give 5 stars, easy to use/read, nice idea."
2,Indoor temperature is inaccurate,"The indoor temperature displayed is about 5 or 6 degrees TOO HIGH. When the room is about 70, the Honeywell tells me it's 76!There doesn't appear to be any kind of adjustment. Otherwise, the unit works well."
3,"OK, But seen better","There is a split in Temp in same room with the remote sensor. Also, have to cycle through several ""empty"" unused remote selections to see the one remote used...another unit probably would have worked better...but this is adequate."
3,Very tiny screws,"The unit seems nice enough and works well. My largest complaint is lack of easy access to the battery compartment on the remote sensor. It requires a tiny screw driver to remove 4 screws. Most people do not have screw driver that small. When the screws are removed, ensure you are over a well lit counter. If you drop one, you will not find it. Who uses screws to secure a battery compartment that must be taken off frequently? Honeywell needs to hire engineers who actually think about the people that have to use the product."
1,Honeywell TM005x,"I just received my Honeywell unit, I am having the same problem everyone else is. The remote and base readings are totally different, even when sitting next to each other. There is about a 5 degree difference in temperature. Makes me wonder if either unit is accurate. I wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased. I would not purchase this, you can probably guess the temperature and humidity levels more accurately than this unit."
5,excellent digital thermometer,"no real complaints about this at all. i have an older wireless unit in another part of the house and they do not interfere with each other, and they read within a degree of each other. i do wish i could se the display to show indoor/outdoor instead of indoor/humidity, but that's minor. this thing does the job!"
4,Excellent value - buying my third one !,"Not a lot to add to what's already been said, except that instead of getting the extra sensors separately you're better off buying the main unit + one sensor x3, same cost and you get three ""home units"" as I've found the remote sensors could communicate with several ""home units"" at the same time. I guess they ""take turns"", at least it works for two, about to try with 3.Would be perfect if it had a clock/sat sync/alarm ans possibly a backlight !"
2,Not very accurate,The internal and external temprature/humidity devices highly disagree in humidity and temp when placed side by side. They aren't useful for my purposes.
5,Necrssary for all who grow orchids,My new love is growing orchids in my house in a high desert region. With this wonderful device I can keep track of the humidity and temp. in the areas I have put them. I added two additional wireless sensors to the main base so I can check different locations in my house from one room. It has three channels making it possible to keep track of four different areas (including where the main base is).
4,Reliable and convenient,"Received it ready to go, and installed it the same day. Remote provides convenient readings of Temp & Humidity with no hookup required. Performs well as I had hoped"
3,Monitoring temperatures,The product monitoring space temperatures and humidity works well and is what I expected although it would have been better if more that one remote station was available. Other units I've had performed the same functions and were less costly.Thank youDennis Di Bon
1,Very inacurrate and hopefully defective,I tested this device for over an hour with several different thermometers. It is inaccurate in both temperature and humidity. I now have to pay shipping because I got a product that doesn't work? EFF that.
4,easy to use,I purchased this product to measure the humidity in my bedroom. It is easy to use and seems to be accurate.
5,"Temp & Humidity, In & Out, Perfect & Simple","The device does just what you would hope. Big LCD numbers can be seen from across the room. No wires, just a couple AA batteries. The outside sending unit also has a small display of its temp and humidity, if that helps. The only fault that one could find is that it displays EITHER the outside numbers OR the inside numbers. Not both at once. A button toggles between inside, and one, two, or three remote senders. Range of sending unit not tested. Durability - we'll see."
4,A basic Thermo-Hygrometer.,"My Radio Shack wireless unit started to produce wacky humidity readings, so it was time for a new Thermo-Hygrometer. Relative Humidity is notoriously difficult to measure accurately, so I will not comment on the accuracy of my unit except to say that it agrees well with other sources. This is a good basic unit at a very low price."
4,Great Value,"This wireless thermometer & hygrometer is a great value and very useful for your home needs. The ability to add additional units is also appealing. Set up is straight forward and not too difficult. If you are using in below freezing conditions, it is advised that you use lithium batteries for your outdoor unit. With alkaline batteries the colder weather has a tendency for the outdoor unit to go dormant for brief periods of time. Extreme fluctuations in temperature may also cause condensation which may also have the unit go dormant. The features on this unit for the price are hard to beat. I definitely recommend this product."
3,Not confident in the readings,I set the main thermometer and the wireless sensor side by side and the temperature is different by 2. I am pretty sure that the main device is the accurate one but this only lowers my confidence in the accuracy.
4,Very nice display,"The product looks very nice and has a large display. I wanted a large digital hygrometer. That was the primary reason I bought it. I think it works well. The termperature read out is about 1 degree higher than other digital termperature gauges that I have. I bought two of these and the temperature difference seems to be the same in both locations so I assume it is part of the design. Either it is more accurate than others I have or it is off by about 1.2 degrees on the high side. Don't know which, but I think it is about 1.2 degrees on the high side. So for instance, when this items reads 76 degress, my other digital temperature gauge reads 74.8 degrees. But, overall, I like it and for the price it seems very well made. Even has a remote sensor. Not sure how accurate the hygrometer is, but it's relative humidity so it is really the changes I am interested in and it works very nicely."
5,Works great,"Bought to keep an eye on humidity levels this winter. Wow the forced air heat really kills humidity. I bought a humidifier after I saw how low it was getting (~20%). I keep one in the bedroom and one downstairs. Love how I can see the remote temp on the main display. Also that you can see temp/humidity levels on the remote unit. Pretty accurate, at least it matches my digital thermostat.Bought from amazon at $24, wouldn't pay the current $47 though."
4,Interesting,"I read a lot of reviews and overall this got the best. Some of the bad reviews say that if you set it next to each other, they will display different temps and humidity. This was true but I found that if left alone for an extended period of time they would start reading very close, if not the same as each other. The slightest breeze or humidity of holding either unit in your hand changed what was displayed. I only got one remote sencer but after using this for a few weeks now, Ill probably get another one for the garage. Its a nice little unit!"
2,INACCURATE OUTDOOR TEMPERATURE,"The primary reason I purchased this thermometer was to monitor the outdoor temperature. The Outdoor temperature is off by approxamately 4-6 degrees. The margin of error is not linear either, so this product is useless to me. Indoor temperature is accurate. Not sure about the accuracy of the humidity."
5,Great Service,The Thermo-Hygrometer arrived on time and in perfect condition. It was well packed and everything is working as expected.
3,Not basic enough for me,Probably a great product but didn't want the piece for remote stations - too complicated. I'm looking for a basic hygrometer.
3,Not sure of the accuracy,This unit comes with a remote unit that also tells the temperature and relative humidity. Even when the units are side by side there is a discrepancy in the relative humidity that each unit reports. I am not sure which one if either is correct. This is a little frustrating. This unit appears to have been made by another company and resold by Honeywell.
4,Accurate,I tested the main unit's accuracy using the Boveda One-Step Calibration and am pleased to say that it's spot-on accurate. The only drawback is the remote's temp and humidity reading differs slightly from the main unit. A difference of as much as +/-2.
3,Reads 2 degrees high indoors,"Setup went as instructed; when I did not follow completely, I was able to reset the indoor unit by removing the batteries and using the Search button to get in comm. with the outdoor unit.The unit/s have been working about one month. I find the indoor unit is high, compared to other thermometers, by about 2 degrees. It is also higher than the outdoor unit, when placed side-by side."
2,"Nice, but not as accurate as hoped","I bought this the other week and when it arrived my first impression was that it was perfect. I intended to use it in a humidor (or coolerdor, to be specific) to monitor the humidity of my cigars. Before putting it in the cooler, I wanted to do the salt test to see how accurate it was. After 14 hours it showed a reading of 70% humidity where an accurate hygrometer should read 75%. I contacted Honeywell and they said, ""The humidity accuracy of our instruments is +/- 5%-7%, so your unit performs within stated specifications."" I only wish they would have that listed on the specs because I would not have purchased it.Other than the less than ideal accuracy, it is a very nice device. Small but easy to read. Easy to use. The remote sensor connected to the main devices almost instantly. I'm going to keep it and use it as long as it consistently reads -5% from the actual value."
1,Broke Too Soon,"It worked for about 3 months, then the remote humidity reading went haywire??????? Then the main unit stopped working (yes I put new batteries in). At $20, it seems silly to bother with returning it...of course that might be Honeywell's master plan."
3,It is acurate,"This is an accurate thermometer, does not show trend of the temperature, which I found very useful with my previous thermometer from another company.Left both the outside and inside thermometers next to each other overnight to see how accurate this product is. In the morning it showed difference in one degree in Fahrenheit."
2,"accurate, while it lasts","The product worked as advertised for 4 months. Now it displays a temperature about 4 degrees higher than it actually is, or sometimes a random value. Quality control? One can add remote sensors but they are a little annoying, since their readings are not simultaneously displayed on the main unit, a button click being needed to scroll through them."
3,It's a thermometer and hygrometer plus remote station.,It's made in China. It measures temperature and humidity. The remote station loses signal occasionally to the base station but reconnects if you force the base station to search again. It's much more accurate than that spring thermometer/hygrometer from Timex. The neat thing is that technically you could get 2 more remote stations to work with the base station. Haven't found them for purchase yet though.
4,Exactly what i was loocking for,"This is exactly what i wish to buy in order to have a better idea of the wheather in my area, very precise temperature and big numbers to read it at certain distance, the transmitter works even at more than 100 feet.."
4,Just what I wanted,"Gives accurate humidity readings in large lettering. I am using only one remote sensor and that is also working well. My previous instrument did not give exterior humidity, but this one does. Also can be used with two other remote sensors which you purchase separately. My remote is 30 feet away and through a brick and block wall with no problems in transmission."
4,Honeywell Wireless Thermo-Hygrometer,"The Honeywell TM005X Wireless Thermo-Hygrometer is an excellent product. I use it to monitor the temperature in two locations indoors. The main unit has a large easy-to-read display. The remote unit also has a display. The temperature readings are accurate. I do not know about the accuracy of the humidity readings however, since I do not have an accurate hygrometer to use as a standard."
3,Accurate????,"Not sure how accurate this is. It is about 3 degrees lower than my heat pump thermostat indicates. It is about 3% higher than another hygrometer I have. I did a calibration test on it, and it was off by 5%.Looks nice, but not so accurate. At least it gives me some idea with a quick glance at it. Large numbers. Just need to take into account the lack of accuracy."
4,Works OK,It works alright for me. It does not always match the temp on a mercury thermometer but it is close enough for me.
2,Be cautious of outdoor sensor,I have been using this pair for seven months to monitor the temperature and humidity of our crawl space. I noticed recently that the remote sensor varies substantially in humidity values from other instruments. This lack of accuracy means I need to buy another remote sensor to replace this one.
5,Perfect for What I Need,I needed at temperature/humidity indicator for a sunroom where I have some orchids. I already had an existing thermometer. This item tracks temperature within a degree of my existing thermometer and provides me reasonable assurance that the humidity is fairly accurate for my needs.
5,The BEST PA Turnpike Publication To Date!,"Many people know that the PA Turnpike was the United States's first superhighway. For that reason, it carries much historical importance. I have studied the Pa Turnpike, at one time known as ""The Worlds Greatest Highway"", for many years. I can say without a doubt that this book by Dakelman and Schorr is the best publication to date on the subject. Most of the photos have never been published before. What is nice is that you can take that book and go to those areas today and see what it looked like under construction.I highly recommend this book for anyone who has ever passed through the blue tollbooths of the Pa. Turnpike, thru the tunnels and over the rolling hills of Pennsylvania."
5,The Pa Turnpike,"I would highly recommend this reading to anyone living in PA. My husband thoroughly enjoyed it, and learning the history of how the turnpike was built and what they went through to get it to what it is today! Excellent rendering."
5,Beautiful Story of Coming to Peace with the Past,"Maggie Cheung is, of course, superb. This is a quiet film that takes the time to develop it's characters. Ann's realization about her own past and as well as that of her mother is wonderful to watch. I especially loved the latter part in Japan where Ann finds out how her mother must have felt living in a land where she didn't speak the language."
4,Replacement Battery,Been using the new battery for about a month and it's working great. If it continues to work as good as it is now I'll buy another one in a few weeks.
4,9.6v replacement battery for Makita Drill,"This battery seems to have similar power and longevity to original and is far cheaper than any replacement I could find locally.It remains to be seen how it will hold up during use and how long it lasts, but so far so good."
5,Great high capacity battery for old drill,I really wanted a NiMh replacement for the old dead NiCd and this battery did the trick. Reasonable price and works fine with Makita drill and original charger. Battery does get warm toward end of charge cycle but otherwise is fine. I especially like the added run time resulting from the improved battery capacity.
5,Good replacement battery for the price,Works as advertised without any problems. I was even offered a spare battery in return for my feedback. So far the battery seems to be holding a charge pretty well and lasting as long as my original one. I will update the review after seeing how it holds up after extended use.
1,did not work,"Worked only once, better buy a new drill. Did not charge at all after using it once. Did fit the drill good though"
5,Karl,"These batteries seem to be equal or better than the stock Makita batteries so far after 2 charges. They feel solid, not cheap."
2,Review,It did not work in my drill and I don't know why as it was working when I threw out the other batteries for it. I waited too long to return it as my drill was at my lake cottage and I didn't make it there in time.
4,Tangram,"My son uses this for crossline therapy and it works very well. It was a good value for the price. The pictures in the book could be a bit bigger, but they work. We're very satisfied."
4,exercise your mind with tangrams,These beautiful wooden shapes allow both young and old to exercise the mind. My children enjoy them as puzzles and it is great for teaching spatial orientation (and patience) as well as creative outlet for the imagination (make up your own tangrams). The book itself has excellent images but the spiral bound nature of it is poorly executed. The wood pieces are very nice and solid with a good finish.
4,"good blocks & puzzles, but not set up well for a game","The blocks are sanded wood with smooth corners, so they're nice to work with, and assembled into a square are about 4"" x 4"". Be aware that each book comes with one set of blocks, so if two people want to compete, you'll need to purchase two books or somehow come up with a second set of blocks.The spiral binding makes it easy to prop the book open to any page, but there are about 18 tangrams shown per page, so it's too easy to ""cheat"" and compare the image you're currently working on to previous/subsequent ones. It would be more challenging if you could only see one tangram at a time."
5,Trip through the land of the Pharaohs,"When/how did Ra become Amen-Ra?How does it feel to travel through the Duat?Why did the human Pharaohs marry their sisters?The answers are in here. The major divinities all make their appearance: Amen-Ra, Isis, Osiris, Horus, Khnemu, Khonsu, Hathor, Thoth. Some of these stories deal with the cosmogony, others with enmity and jealousy between Gods; some appear to be PR attempts by certain Pharaohs, while others are simple tales of adventure and cunningness hieroglyphed by palace scribes and priests; some of these stories deliver justice according to the principle of maat (similar to the Vedic Rta or the Chinese Tao) while the others deal with their fascination with dark magic of the nights.You simply cannot help being transported to an ancient land and ancient thoughts, to the era when pretty much our knowledge of history begins. Surely, one has to thank the author for bringing us the tales and to all who over the centuries got the hieroglyphs decoded."
4,Nice introduction to Egyptian mythology,"Only thing I would caution future buyers about is that if you're buying this to share with younger age kids, the book lacks illustrations.Our girls were captivated by the stories, but they wanted to also ""see"" them while we were reading them ..."
2,Tales of Ancient Egypt,"The book was not exactly what I was looking for. I was hoping for a history of ancient Egypt, including how they built all of the tombs, discussions about their religious pantheons, etc and instead the book I received was very short, kind of beat-up and all it had were stories/tales about Egypt. I guess I should have read the description better. I'll learn better next time."
4,Great Book,Great Book - there is a song that goes with it from Sound Beginnings. Was in okay shape even though it said it was like new
5,A classic and a must read!,A wonderful work of literature that is certain to be enjoyed by your middle school child and reread by you a dozen times!
3,Everyone takes this book out of context,"That's right. This book was written as a rebuttal against those who actually DO believe that a ""perfect"" society can exsist. As you read further into the text, you'll realize that Moore's seemingly practical, nearly attainable ideals become increasingly distorted and far-fetched. Not unlike large chunks of our own worldview, no?"
2,"Incomplete, Poor Transliteration","If you need to read Utopia quickly and don't care about reading the dedicatory letters or having explanatory notes, or maybe if you only have $2.00 and change to spend, this is a good book for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere. Utopia was created partly for fun, as the Penguin edition makes clear by including the Utopian alphabet. Clever puns are lost here: you might never guess that the river ""Anidrus"" in this edition comes from More's own ""Anydrus"", meaning ""no water"" in Greek. And of course there are no notes in this edition to tell you what you're missing."
4,more was a modest genius (hard to find among christians),thomas more's utopia is a great work of fiction. Using false pen names and creating false places (utopia is actually a fictional land) he escaped severe criminal punishment and still was able to tell an incredible philosophical tale. Its fairly easy to read and its ideas are straight forward and logical. A great work that started utopian literature.
2,"Interesting and thought-provoking, but a real bore a times.","Well, whether it is a respected work or not, the first part is just 3 men sitting around discussing the problems of the time. It really is almost painful to read at this part. But the 2nd part does improve, but all it is is a giant, detailed description of a perfect society that in my opinion would never work because perfect societies come from perfect people, which people are not. So if your looking for a plot, storyline, or protagonist, DO NOT READ!!!!- 15 year old AP European History student"
3,A little of voodoo,"I was expecting more about this book but is some desapointing because it has only a few spells and the 80% of these aren't authentic voodoo spells(like the buckeye 90% are not original spells from the author like the love spell with a poppet is from ANNA RIVA'S voodoo book this book don't show the real voodoo spells with the poppet(and nails) don't show the work with the ""veves"" and the loas invocations but the book has histories about pacts with the devil legend like the rabbit. But not A real voodoo, voudou or vadou spells.I know some real voodoo priestes and I know the voodoo spell whe I see it."
3,Disappointment,I was much disappointed with the book because before purchasing it i thought it contains lots of spells but in fact it contains stories and anectdotes.
1,Hollywood inspired balderdash,"I saw this at the bookstore. There are a million bullscrap books on Vodun, of which none are true, because the true practicners keep it a secret, and have so for generations, and will continue to.This joke books is designed to feed off the goth/emo craze, preying on gulible and ignorant high schoolers that think they are wizards practicing black magic. They have no idea the truth behind this ancient religion,and are living in a bubble reality while Corprate pigs and scam artists like the author of this book make money off them.It's non informative crap. You'd think the Dr. Snake title would be a tip off. May the wrath of the loa scourge the writer of this tripe and sent them on the hands and knees, crawling to Samdei."
3,what about zombies?,"i'm a 13 year old arch-druid and i bought the book hoping it would have some spells on zombification, but it didn't. i really would enjoy having an undead slave. welp, i gotta go, Buffy is coming on :)~"
3,"Good Voodoo guide, but not an excellent spellbook.","When I saw this book here on ..., I thought it looked really 'cool'. I was actually looking for a spellbook to work from, and by looking at the name I thought this one was perfect. I was quite dissapointed when I opened it. It is a good book, and it does have a good few spells, but it mainly is a guide through voodoo and conjure, with a few life storys from the author. Also, after checking the web-sites at the back of the book labelled suppliers, they really aren't great online stores either. The lucky mojo doll is cute, and it is an over-all good book, with a good guide and good storys, but definitly NOT a good spellbook. ~Blessed Be~"
3,Curious shopper,"I am really into Hoodoo. I was curious about this book, so I bought it. I wanted to buy Doktor Snakes 2.0 book but it was sold out. I liked the stories and the easy reading. I was looking for more spells though.I hope Snake come out with a 3.0 book!"
5,Empowering,"Doktor Snake's Voodoo Spellbook is utterly charming, earthy, entertaining, delightfully written and lusciously illustrated. Doc's storytelling style draws you in from the first page with its homey, welcoming warmth and wit. It is instructive and straightforward rather than academic.Some of the spells call for conditioning oils for which Doc helpfully gives a list of suppliers on page 125. Many of the formulas can be found online, if the reader wants to home-make them. However, some of the basic ingredients may still need to be ordered, like dragon's blood resin. It may just be easier to order them ready-made from the suppliers Doc recommends.Doktor Snake's Voodoo Spellbook opens the reader to a world of rich experiences, not only of his empowerment, but ours too.I highly recommend this gem and am hoping Doc treats us to a Volume 2."
3,Hrmm,"I can't say this book is great, as I don't know much about voodoo... however it was comical if anything. You can tell the book isn't supposed to be too serious... it is quite short and I think it's more for laughs, especially since it comes with a cheap, mass-produced, voodoo doll.However, I did find it to be entertaining and perhaps some of the things in it may actually work... who knows. I find trouble reading a book when someone is talking about individuals who are hundreds of years old but all of these occult books are a little out there for me. If you have some money to spend, go ahead and pick this book up, it's worth the money, never know when you might want to sell your soul to the devil to learn to play an instrument (yes, that is in there).-Ryan M."
2,"Lots of data, little information","As a book for learning a topic, this one is wanting. It doesn't develop the numerous code snippets into whole programs, leaving the reader uncertain how they actually work. It states much, explains little. As others have pointed out, there are many books on related programming topics that do a good job of bringing a novice or modestly experienced programmer up to speed - one must be a well versed programmer to benefit from this book."
5,wxWidgets Developement made easy,A very good book. Analytical and Comprehensive. Even if you are a novice in programming the author achieves to make you understand how to develop apps with wxWidgets. Experienced programmers will find it useful for its great span of advanced subjects. All given in a well presented package. A must have. Support the Open Source Application Foundation.
2,"Book claims CD has *.sln, or *.dsw files but it doesn't","Using a multi-platform freeware or shareware library entails more than just providing some source code. The CD ROM accompanying the book contains no Microsoft solution or project files, and no make files for Linux, or MAC for the examples in the book. In fact the CD contains no build files of any kind for any operating system for the chapter examples (the WxWidgets distribution included with the book DOES have them, but you will want to download the newer version anyway)! Since the point of the book is Cross-Platform GUI programming, the build files are essential for a complete understanding of the process. To add insult to injury, the book does not discuss the build process beyond what is in Appendix A, and the information in that appendix assumes the CD ROM has the build files. The errata list for this book is quite large. The FAQ's for the book don't mention the build files."
3,The shows are great,"The show is great, however we discovered upon opening that one of the DVD's was cracked and would not play. The other two DVD's are perfect. LOVE this show!!!"
5,awesome,This is the best kids show EVER. The kids and I love Peep and the big wide world and will definitely purchase another box set.
4,Very good and my child loves it. But a purple duck?,"I can't say anything bad about Peep because kids love it -- think it's hysterical. I confess, I'm lacking the creativity or insight to fully grasp the concept of a duck that looks like a purple-ish blue egg. But the series was not created with me in mind. If my child likes it, then so be it.The series has nice themes of friendship mixed in with a little bit of science. And it is completely lacking songs that might drive you nuts as a parent."
2,HAD TO RETURN ITEM - TOO BIG,"I had to return this battery that I ordered for my cordless phone.It was too big for my phone and I could not use it.Therefore, I can't say how well this battery works."
1,Do not buy if you are not sure of the reference,"I bought a wrong item, it is not a seller's fault but you should be sure about your phone brand, and battery reference."
5,exactly what I needed,"I used this as a power input for a guitar pedal board. It worked perfectly and was very easy to install. One thing to be aware of is that you will will need a 1 7/8 hole saw to install it. That size is a little hard to find. Ace hardware does stock it, but strangely most of the larger home improvement stores do not."
3,Works great for block heaters,These work great for block heaters. I have installed a couple of them on Ford Powerstrokes. The cord on those often fails from dangling in the wind while driving eventually breaking the wire internally. This is a great fix for that. Installation is really simple with a hole saw.Follow up. The cover on this will not stay in place and is always out of place. This is not consistent with the an older version of this same item. It is actually kind of annoying but I live wiht it. I think the cover needs a tigher fit to the body.
2,Worthless in cold weather,"Looks and works fine until the weather gets cold. Flap gets stiff and won't stay closed, fills up with snow and ice."
5,Ten years afer,Ten years after is 1 of the best rock groups ever alvin and his gang can really rock !
1,not good.,"Get the inline tubing water bottle for no mess easy refill water. This one is useless, the mice fill it with shavings and bedding and knock it over all the time. If you have one mouse and a new habitrail mouse kit then it may be ok but anymore than one this bottle will be nothing but trouble."
4,Acceptable but a bit expensive,"This is a rather large pan with removable nonstick rack that will hold all but the biggest birds. The interior nonstick surface cleans easily, but getting it in your sink (or dishwasher) can be a challenge. The plain aluminum exterior scratches if you so much as look at it, and mine came apparently pre-loved with a hard surface. In practice however one pan works as well as another. The rack holds food securely, doesn't stick to the food, fits well, and the entire contraption will fit into even smallish ovens if need be. The handles are secure and the pan cools quickly (thanks to its aluminum construction). Overall not bad, just $10 more than it should be."
2,"High budget, low taste","The really amazing thing about this album is the cover versions. Every single one manages to take a great or at least a decent song and make it unlistenable. How can you suck 90% of the energy out of ""Everlasting Love""? (How COULD you?) Listen and find out. ...Or don't!"
3,Bridget Jones: The edge of reason,"This movie like the first is raunchy too much sex and swearing, But Colin Firth will always be one of my favorite actors."
4,"Good, but not all!","After the movie, had to get the soundtrack. It is as great as the first. (Thought I wish Gabrielle did another song!). However, there are only 15 songs, and the songs we really wanted were not on this one. So doing an internet search we discovered another album in the UK WITH the 15 plus the other 6 songs left off in the US version. So disappointed! I would not have bought it to start with if I had known that there was another FULL album out there. Now I have to wait for the import, and REPURCHASE the other 15 songs."
3,WHA' HAAAAPENED?,"I would REALLY like to know why the excellent Jamelia song, ""Stop"" has TOTALLY different LYRICS on the CD than in the movie. Weirdest thing. The film version of the song had beautiful lyrics that were dead on appropriate to the scene. The album version is a generic love song. Forgettable lyrics. I'm hoping that the IMPORT will have the real version. Again, as with the first movie, the IMPORT CD is the only way to go, and Bridget fans will find that the songs they TRULY LOVED FROM THE MOVIES ARE NOT ON THE US VERSIONS OF THE CD's. Another music scam ? I'm afraid so. Bad form. Other than that the songs are great for Bridget devotees. BUT SAVE YOUR $ AND SHELL OUT FOR THE IMPORT, AS THE RECORD COMPANY SEEMS TO BE FORCING US TO DO."
1,Worst Experience,"I'll never buy from this company again. My worst experience ever buying anything from Amazon. Absolutely zero communication from them until I actually filed a complaint through Amazon. Then, they were slow giving a partial refund."
3,Was expecting some scares...,".... unfortunately the scares never materialized. Good acting, characters played by major Israeli actors, but whole story somewhat farfetched and ridiculous. I understand this is Isreal's first attempt at making horror movies and they obviously need some more practice. The DVD released in Isreal containes Extras, while the U.S. version is bare bones only. Information above is incorrect. This movie was released theatrically in the U.S in 2011 while the theatrical realease in Israel was in Dec of 2010 (not that it really matters)."
2,Rabies Review,"I found this movie pretty boring with little to no story. It is hard to follow. I am under the impression its a cobbled together story about how certain people slowly become homicidle killers. It is all set in the same wooded national park setting, hence a super low budget filem."
3,Up In Flames not a burnout.,"I purchased this book primarily for the photos of the paint work and was not disappointed. There is a good variety of impressive looking vehicles well photographed. The text lets the reader down slightly. The history is informative and hits the main points but is a bit dry. The bios seem to have quite a bit of detail for brief articles but are formulaic and read as if created with a computer template. If you are looking for ideas for a project car or bike this book contains a wealth of ideas and inspiration. If you are into automotive history this is a good addition to your collection. If you are looking for a good read, keep looking."
4,love this potty for the car!,"we have this in my car for our long commute. it's great. my daughter loves using it.it could use some rubber on the bottom to keep from sliding during turns, but other than that it's great."
1,Least favorite out of 3,"This potty chair is a pain! The design is odd and flat. The urine hit the splash guard and ends up under the little tray. It seems to collect in weird places, out of sight, and mysteriously appears later. I'm constantly wiping this thing, it's just a messy design. My 2 year old really doesn't like to use this one. It's her last resort. It was also pretty pricey for what it is. At first, I thought that using it someday as a stepstool might oftet the high price, but now I just regret buying it in the first place."
4,great fit,"My daughter is so excited about her new boon potty bench! At 2.5, she has been ""too busy"" to bother with the other versions much, but loves to sit on this one. I read the posts about the opening being on the small side and that is exactly why I got it. She is a petite, but tall little one so the bjorn and seat fitting over the toilet were uncomfortable for her. This one is still a bit on the bigger side, but she fits it so much better!"
2,Bummer seat.,"I had to order this online as Hawaii did not have it at the time I bought it. What a disappointment!!! My son has a hard time keeping his urine in the potty because the shield is too small. Also, my son is tall, so the seat is not comfortable and the pot itself is very small. If I could do it again, I would wait until he showed signs of readiness instead of buying what I liked. I would let him see what fit him best and how effective it would be being that some of the potties do not have shields for boys. Really check and see if your child fits in the seat appropriately and if you have a son, make sure to see if the shield will fit him properly. Buyer beware!!If you want to try another seat, try the Baby Bjorn. I have found that my son is more comfortable in that chair and we have no mess as the shield is very high."
2,Not a great choice for a boy,"The potty has a very small opening and my son was too big to sit comfortably on it by the time he was ready to use it. I have noticed that many of the postive reviewers mention they have a daughter. I think that many little girls potty train at a much earlier age than boys, and so the small size of the seat is not an issue for them. I would say that a child sized 18-24 months would fit comfortably on the seat...if your child is already a 2T or larger, you'll probably be better with another potty."
2,Hard to clean,"I didn't buy this potty but rather got it second-hand from my sister. That said , if I had bought it, I would have returned it right away. To be honest, I haven't tried it out with my daughter so the issue isn't whether it works or not but it's design. There are so many crevices and nooks in this thing that should a mess happen where peepee didn't go where it was supposed to go then you would have to immerse the whole thing in clorox to properly santize it. I ran into this just cleaning it up to try using it.It is a cool design and that it can be used as a sturdy stepping stool is good but I think the cleaning hassel would be too much of a headache. I have a Baby Bjorn and with all it's two pieces it weighs nothing and has no such crevices. I'm keeping the boon as a stepping stool only."
1,FORGET IT,"my daughter uses this.. I just wanna throw it out..PROS..Looks nice.Alright.. step stool.Storage.CONS..Its big.Doesnt have grippy bottom.Directions say not to lean on backing, I keep mine up against a wall.THE BIGGEST CONcleaning it.. it might look smooth but it had a bunch of nooks and crannies on the inside on the pull out tray thing.. I could clean it a dozen times and I still cant get the urine smell off of it..its gross.. I am going to try to COMPLETELY dunk it in cleaner.. and even if that works, still pointless! I dont want to have to fill up a bathtub in chemicals to clean a potty chair everyday.."
5,He likes it!,"We had another potty donated to us. It consisted of thre separate pieces. Two of those pieces had to be removed in order to turn it into a bench. That made a hassle to turn into potty again because we had to wrestle our son with one hand and put the potty together with the other. Then he didn't want to sit on it.I purchased the Boon Potty Bench from a coworker outside of Amazon and got successful results the same night I brought it in! He likes the way toilet paper goes into one compartment and books or toys into the other. Now it's like THE place to play with the iPad and wait while he is sitting there.Plus, not to forget that this one conveniently converts into a bench (to wash hands or brush teeth) by just closing ""the lid."""
2,Not good for boys,"I bought this potty because reviewers said it fit their taller/bigger/older children best. We were definitely challenged with finding a potty to fit our son who is a big kid for his age, he's not yet 2.5 years. While this potty bench seemed like a good option, he has been attempting to use it and it is extremely difficult to get him positioned just so behind the shield. The shield is too small in height and width, it is a very difficult target for a toddler. We have tried to direct him behind it or get him to point down, but for a new trainer, all of this creates more anxiety than anything else. We are extremely frustrated. The design of this chair is very thoughtful in the way the shield inserts, unfortunately it does not function well."
2,Yes for girl but no for boy,"I believe this potty would work well for a girl. However, it is not a potty to buy for a boy or atleast not a taller boy. I purchased 2. My son is small enough that I can help direct him into the orange guard. My nephew is way too tall and it in not possible to direct him into it at all. The toilet paper and storage sides are a huge hit with both boys, but the function issues seem like something the manufacturer should have product tested and worked out prior to marketing. I would also suggest putting rubber on the bottom to keep it from sliding while ysing as a step stool."
2,"Nice to look at, not nice to use...","We got this because it looked nice an wouldn't be an eyesore in our bathroom and it closed. It's rather large so it just seems to be in our way all of the time, the seat is too narrow so when our boy sits on it the guard squishes him in all the wrong places because the sides squish his thighs in, which in turn squishes other parts so we have to wedge the guard in between his legs and by that point he's had enough, therefore not wanting to sit on it any longer. We've found that an insert for the toilet is much easier than this."
3,you get what you pay for,"It feels a bit flimsy, but it did the job of holding my 15 lb cat from one home to another during a move. if you have a smaller cat, it would be ok for longer travel, but if your kitty is big, i wouldn't count on this being able to carry it in here for a long walk. i have a more sturdy one for other travel, but needed a second to bring two cats at the same time."
2,Where are the instructions?,"I really dislike returning a product because it lacked assembly instructions, but I will have to do so in this case. I ordered a larger carrier at the same time (the Asan 2-door) which had only illustrations for instructions, but it was a piece of cake to assemble compared to this one. There is no visible way to open and close the door on the carrier for instance, the pieces which one would think would fit and snap into place easily do not, and there are pieces which I have no idea where they are supposed to go. I would guess they are for the door, but they are too large for the holes. If I could have assembled it, I think it would have been a good fit for my approximately 7 pound cat, but since I cannot, I will purchase a pre-assembled one in a store. I would not recommend this carrier."
2,Incomplete info,"The size of the product was not displayed on your page. While searching for this product on Google the size was shown as 22"" long ans I was sent to your site to purchase. I placed the order and received the product today. Opened the box and to my surprise it was only 19"" long instead of 22""."
5,Unbelievably Fast,I can't believe how fast I received my products. I was shocked. The product was exactly how I expected it to be. Thanks Ozbo!!
4,Lasted for 2 years for my 10 lbs Shih Tzu,"So my girlfriend got this plain dog crate for our Shih Tzu when she was still a puppy from Petfood Express. It served as a transport and safe zone for her whenever she was distressed or just needed to go hide. Whenever I'm about to leave the house she would quickly run into this crate and sit there quietly waiting for me to take her along. I especially like how the cage door is completely removable so she has these options.So why 4 stars and not five? Well.. just the other day as I was carrying her out in this crate to the car the handle broke and she went tumbling down my driveway inside the crate. It kind of funny because with all her hair she looks like a chubby pig who has a complex about her weight. Anyway, I'm currently shopping for a replacement and stumbled upon this crate again. I'm still going to check out reviews on the other crates but most of them have only a cage door that swings open or does not look like it can be removed easily."
2,cheap = chintzy,"I didn't want to spend a lot for a crate to transport my cat to the vet. I read reviews so was ready to have a puzzle to solve in assembling the crate. I wasn't ready however, for quite as low a grade item as I found. The key issue I want to share is that THE DOOR OPENS WHEN PRESSURE IS APPLIED ROM THE INSIDE.... my cat escaped when I wasn't looking, Be sure to keep an eye on the little plastic ""latches"" which begin to turn allowing door to open if your cat is trying to get out."
2,You get what you pay for,"It was the cheap price that lured me into buying 1 of these, but it's not made very well. it comes disassembled and it's not super easy how to put the thing together. On top of that, I had a very unpleasant experience when I had to get a feral cat I'd recently adopted to the vet. I couldn't catch the cat at all and finally got a cat whisperer over to my house. She caught him and got him in the carrier. I was a little bit early for the vet appointment so as I was getting ready, maybe 10 minutes after the cat whisperer left, my feral cat found his way out, actually knocking down the metal gate. It's also pretty small, so if you have a largish cat, I can tell you from experience that he/she will dislike entering the carrier if they have to creep in.This thing is cheaply made and a determined cat will get out."
2,Just okay....not real safe!,I bought this little crate as a carrier for foster puppies to get them back and forth to the vet office. I don't feel this crate is safe for actually carrying around a pet. The handle just snaps in and the locks are plastic that turn and lock and I feel that with any pet over a few pounds it might come apart when carrying them. I also don't like the way the door closes and locks into position. I have had it pop out on me. Now I use this crate without the door as an area for the puppies to go to and relax or play in. I don't carry them in it. I will purchase something a little more sturdy and secure.
3,.,"It is a nice carrier, but my kitten opened the locks somehow within the first half an hour. She was jumping up and down inside as she was scared, but I think the locks should be stronger than that."
3,"ok for the price, cheaply made","This crate is fine for the price. The small size is really small, make sure your dog is a small puppy or a miniature/toy breed of some sort if you are going to buy the small one."
2,GGW GP 11,"This volume does not compare with the earlier versions. There is the average amount of flashing with a large amount of it devoted to selling the GGW Tshirts. There is one girl on girl segment which has appeared before on another GGW DVD.For those of you that have seen it.It is three girls in sort of a game. A good looking one with sizable knockers opts to be the receiver, thus the other 2 are givers. And so it goes. The givers give the reciever her dues big time and then go to the shower and the brunette giver on her knees gives to the reciever who is standing.I quite enjoyed it the first time I saw it but didn't get a kick out of paying to see it again when I already had it on file. Thats the size of the hot action. There is a 2 girl shower segment but it doesn't develope much heat. I enjoyed most of the Girl Power series but this one was disappointing."
3,so and so,"I've bought this CD and Bande à Part together and I'm pretty bored with them after listening to them a couple of times. Same rhythm, same voices, same type of music... it's really exhausting after a while. I just wish they would experience something new from time to time, not take a song and make it the same type of cover over and over again instead."
4,Oddly apealing,"I think what strikes me about this album is the bizarre choice of songs. Nouvelle Vague could have easily chosen nothing but New Wave classics to cover but instead they threw in some slightly obscure and unexpected tunes. The concept is strange enough but hearing Killing Joke and Dead Kennedy's done this way is just twisted. It is undoubtedly a novelty recording and it's done pretty well. Some of the breathy vocals are a little irritating at times but overall it's a fun listen. My favorite is Tuxedomoon's ""In A Manner Of Speaking""."
5,star struck,Oh man when I bought this I thought it was just a novelty Record man was I wrong this is fantastic and gets regular play in my jukebox!!!! love it
2,Boring.,"Basically took a bunch of great songs, dumbed them down, made them all sound the same, and made them very boring in the process. There's nothing unique about any of the songs, they are really boring covers you might expect to see some 18 year old freshman in college who is obsessed with Belle and Sebastian cover at a coffee shop. Boring, trite, nice effort but try again please.. I think the worst cover is the slaughter of Guns of Brixton. The Undertones cover on here is pretty bad, too... I don't know, I didn't fancy this. If you like boring yet somehow hip music, this may be your cup of tea. You should probably get the Garden State soundtrack too, that would be great for those boring days in your dorm or at the coffee shop with your soy vanilla latte... That was a bad shot at irony.You won't like this review because it's true."
3,There is no Joy in Mudville,"A quote from the book. ""I noted not much joy was present in me (the books author), and he (the teacher) asked how I might find a better balance.""There is no doubt that Mr. Rothberg knows his subject matter backwards and forward. However for me, the writing is relentlessly morose. The book does not find the right ""balance.""If Buddhism is about increasing happiness, our own and others, then I would rather do my learning with books that exhibit some degree of happiness, otherwise it is just too depressing. I think we learn better when our moods are lifted not depressed. At least I do.I plodded through the book, picked up a few things along the way, but it was a long hard slog."
3,ONLY for die-hard fans,"This import has the worst sound quality of ANY Japanese import I have. Quite unbelieveable really, and just wanted to put the caution flag up on this one. Very costly for a single CD, it's only drawing power is getting all the Peggy Lee AND Ella Fitzgerald tracks together. A CD sized LP cover reproduction is cute, but hardly makes up for the sound, most of the songs can be found on other sources at ten TIMES the quality of sound. If you are not a diei-hard fan of Lee or Ella, I'd pass on this particular import."
2,Pete Kelly's Blues It isn't!,"One might think that in ordering this CD one is receiving the soundtrack with Peggy Lee and Ella Fitzgerald from ""Pete Kelly's Blues""--well, you're not. At the top of the jacket of the CD, there are small words--too small to read on the order ""songs from [Pete Kelly's Blues]."" They sing the songs from the film but not the same arrangements and not the original band with Dick Cathcart,Matty Matlock,Nick Fatool and others. They recorded on RCA Victor; this band on Decca, and unless you read Japanese, you can't know who they are. The arrangements for Peggy Lee are too lifeless (especially ""O Didn't He Ramble""), although Ella's renditions are faithful to the movie version. If you're a Peggy and/or Ella fan, it's OK, but if you want the authentic jazz from the movie, this is not for you! The words included to the songs are pluses."
2,Not Pete Kelly band or arrangements,"As I specified in a review for the more expensive CD, this CD would be of value only for the Peggy Lee/ Ella Fitzgerald fans, as the band accompaning them is not the Matty Matlock-Dick Cathcart group featured on the LPs and other CD and in the movie ""Pete Kelly's Blues"". The arrangements are not even close to the ones used in the movie. ""O Didn't He Ramble"" is anything but a burial rite but set in an anguishing blues format. At $34 or $24, this is hardly representative of the movie, the LPs, and the later radio-television programs' music."
5,music with a sense of humor...life is but a joke...,60's innovative stalwarts...drawing upon English Musical Hall and Spike Jones...very Brittish...very funny...and great music...only the 1960's could have spawened such a wonderful concoction.
4,interesting 2 disc introduction,"This 1974 compilation has been eclipsed in more recent years by more in-depth CDs such as 'Cornology', so why would you want this? Because it is (I'm pretty sure) the only CD which has Vivian's singles 'Suspicion' (excellent send-up of the Elvis classic) and 'Blind Date' (in which two odd 'people' meet at Waterloo Station ...), alongside a different mix of 'Labio Dental Fractive' than you get on Cornology *and* the original version of 'Canyons of Your Mind' (with the sequins! hooray!). You also get another Neil single uncollected elsewhere and Roger Spear's version of 'Release Me'. Otherwise it is more of the same although I'll never quibble with a CD which includes 'Hunting Tigers', 'My Pink Half of the Drainpipe', 'Tent', 'Jollity Farm' and (if you must) 'Urban Spaceman'. I do miss 'Death Can for Cutie' but you can't have everything."
4,"O.K., Kids. Raise your hands if you've heard of this guy?","The wonderful thing about The Burgenius (well, one of them) is that as a child he was exposed to real culture. Then came rock and/or roll, and he went down hill fast, but much of the culture remained into adulthood. Harold Arlen is one of the great composers of American music. This is a wonderful compilation of timeless songs that have enriched the lives of people for generations; before Generation Gauche. True, it's not the Butthole Surfers, but what is? Give your ears a break and your brain something to work with. Buy this, put it on your Ipod; you can tell people you're listening to Green Day...no, don't do that! No one should be encouraged to listen to Green Day, under any circumstances. Tell them it's Flipper. That alone will impress anyone. I don't listen to Flpper myself...hey, why am I writing about Flipper? Tell them it's Bukowski. Now run along and look up Charles Bukowski, you cultural trash bins."
5,very nice,A very nice Cd with great Christmas blues. I really like the multi-artist covers of White Christmas. A classic song that never grows old. Charles Brown fans will find a gem here too.
4,please come home Christmas,The CD is great. The songs sound like they did in the olden days. The only exception is my favorite: please come home for Christmas. The tempo was a little faster than I remembered. The version I remembered was sung a little slower and the bells didn't ring quite as fast.
2,underwhelmed,"I had never heard Todd Snider before buying this CD, but after reading enough of the positive reviews, I thought it might be something I would like. When I hear names such as John Prine, Randy Newman, Bob Dylan, and Steve Earle being thrown around for comparison's sake, that made me very eager to hear this CD. But, after a dozen listenings I just couldn't get into it. Needless to say, this album didn't do much for me. I didn't find the songs particularly memorable, nor clever or funny. It sounds like he's trying to sound like a variety of different artists without being very distinctive himself. Perhaps there are better CDs by Todd Snider to start with, but this one left me very underwhelmed."
2,"The Devil You Know , Or Is It?","After waiting for a very long time for Todd to release something to watch, we are finally given this offering. Being a fan since the very start you can imagine how interested and excited I was about this. After breaking open the packaging, sitting in my most comfortable chair, and pressing play on the DVD player .................... THIS?!?!?!?! Now, I've been lucky enough to see this man in concert, and also lucky enough to have access to many live recordings, and after the hype all we get is a bunch of rehersals and a few snippets of live shows. To be honest with you all, I was so disappointed that I haven't even watched the whole thing yet. If you're a fan like me, you'll want this. If you ain't, I wouldn't bother.Sorry Todd, you blew it this time."
1,I bought two...,"and they BOTH cracked after a couple of weeks, right at the top of the handle. I have no idea what happened; I don't recall anything that might have caused the damage. Too bad, because the pitchers look good and have a large capacity. It seems like a good glass pitcher is hard to find."
3,Barely up to Snuff,"The story was just OK. It came of a bit formulaic (sp?) By that I mean it seemed rather phoned in. It was readable and had it's moments but ""Illegal Aliens"" it's not."
3,"Fun, but needs proofreading","The premise is hilarious, and generally carries the execution, which could be better. I have finished reading this book since I first left the review, and I would give it four stars if the system let me, even though I was hesitant to do that, as there is a lot to overcome in terms of polish. The connections and little jokes are so many that I could overlook the sloppiness -- but it took getting halfway through the book to do that. The publisher would do well to invest in a proofreader (the ""lentil"" for ""lintel"" errors especially vexed me) and a little editing, although the extraneous adjectives did contribute to the over-the-top Victorian swashbuckler atmosphere. Still, it made me wonder whether the publisher was a ""real"" one or a ""vanity press."" This book is bit of light reading that's enjoyable enough in its own regard -- just be sure you've read the prereqs: Chthulhu and Holmes and the other silly Victorian era tales."
2,A guilty pleasure?,"That Darn Squid God by Nick Pollatta was quite funny (though a bit too over the top). Most of the reviewers liked it. The send-ups were funny as heck, but I found the story to get sillier with each passing page. Eventually the story (for my taste), felt too silly and unnecessary and I could not finish it. The rating should be 3 stars for those that enjoy a light, entertaining read. I'll try to finish it at a later time when I feel silly."
1,why the rave reviews???,"Wow, I didn't care for this book at all. It was bizarre, and not in a good way. I felt like I was missing something. I know this is not a very insightful review, but I'm at a loss. It didn't take much time to get through this book, but I find myself wishing I had that time back. Just not good sci-fi/fantasy, IMHO."
5,"Informative, Easy To Follow Bike Repair Instructions For Everyone","Excellent guides, extremely easy to follow and understand, although a few sections where a torque wrench would help.I watched this guide and serviced both of my road and mountain bikes the very first time with 0 problems."
3,Good Beginner Info - Sort Of,"I bought the ""Bike Garage"" DVD because my wife and I just upgraded our bikes, and a good friend advised to learn how to repair flats because, ""nobody gets a flat tire while their bike is in the garage."" Good advice!I can say that, for the most part, the instructions are pretty easy to follow, although: 1. I wouldn't attempt 90% of the repairs they demonstrate, and 2. they didn't show how to remove and then replace a rear wheel w/ deralliuer that has a flat - my #1 concern. Oh well, I remembered enough from my childhood days that the DVD was a sufficient refresher (I hope!).In terms of production and navigation, the DVD is relatively amateurish. However, there are good, tight shots that clearly show what they are doing. In the end, I didn't buy this to be a Friday night's video entertainment, anyway. So, it's good enough - jump cuts and bad host aside.If you want to learn just enough to do the ""MUST"" repairs to your bike, this will do well."
2,PRODUCT DESCRIPTION WRONG!!,AMAZON HAS AN INCORRECT PRODUCT DESCRIPTION THAT SAYS THERE ARE 4 .5 LB END WEIGHTS FOR THESE MAKING THEM 2 LBS EACH. IN FACT THE END WEIGHTS ARE 2 LBS EACH MAKING A TOTAL OF 5 LBS PER HANDLE AFTER ADDING THE EXTRA WEIGHTS. THE PRODUCT ITSELF IS WONDERFUL AND OF GREAT QUALITY! THANK GOODNESS THE PERSON THEY WERE FOR DIDN'T MIND THE WEIGHT DIFFERENCE SO I WONT HAVE TO MESS WITH A RETURN!
3,Not very well made,"I have had these for a few weeks now and the add on weight on one end is stripped. It is not smart to use plastic threads onto a metal shaft. They would have been better of they molded a metal insert into the add-on. I tightened it hand tight (not all animal on it) and it kept coming loose so I applied a bit more effort and bang.....stripped. The neoprene covering is kind of sloppily fit so I expect that these will not last. You are better off buying individual weights, which I will do from here."
4,Great date movie!,"Adult without ever getting purient, both hard hearted and romantic, I found ""Priceless"" to be great fun all around: Tatou is stunning playing a role that might have gone to Audrey Hepburn had she been better known as a dramatic actress (as seen in ""The Childrens' Hour"") than as a beautiful gamine (or if say, the film version of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" been more upfront about Holly GoLightly's working life.... but the real star of the show is Gad Elehrah, the waiter who stumbles into a new life as a gigilo, paradoxically in the name of love. His Chaplin-esque gestures and facial expressions speak volumes. And yet, for all this, the movie's plot is silly. gorgeously fun. A great date movie."
3,teaching the tricks of the trade...,"The light French film Priceless(Hors de Prix) follows the story of beautiful Irene(Audrey Tatou) a woman who adores the life of luxury and her run in with the sweet Jad(Gad Elmaleh) that turns her life upside down.When she's caught by her fiance, fooling around with Jad, Irene is thrown out and runs to Jad only to find out that he is not rich as she'd been led to believe, but an employee of the hotel.Irene can find no one to take her in so she turns to Jad again, and after a day realizes it will never work since Jad cannot supply the funds she 'needs' to live.When Jad encounters a lonely widow who agrees to help provide for him, t hings get interesting.I cannot say it is the deepest film I've ever watched, but it is enjoyable. Audrey Tautou is stunning and adds personality to an otherwise unlikeable character."
5,great movie,"Reason enough for watching this film is gazing at the beauty of Audrey Tautou for 2 hours. I watched it twice within 24 hours before my online rental expired. I think she does a great job some of my favorite moments from her: when she first meets Jean and is perturbed about the missing barman, that face of frustration for a drink was classic, when she is waiting for her rich old lover to go to sleep and he won't, the expressions she makes are incredibly dead on, and the scene where she is locked out of her room and is sitting by the pool shivering. The scene where Jean shows off his new watch is also a great one. I think my favorite thing about this film is how good the moments are when their is no dialogue. That is what sets it apart. Jean gives Irene a euro for 10 seconds of her time. With that 10 seconds he gazes upon her beauty in wonder - loved it!"
4,Money isn't the answer.,"It was a nice little movie, but it was in French. It would of been a lot better ifit was in English."
5,French bon bon,Fine little film for sheer enjoyment and relaxation. Great casting of the two main characters brings it to life. Plot is predictable but not annoying with special effects.
4,At Last...A New Romantic Comedy that is Sexy and Fun,"The premise of this movie is really quite delightful. A bartender is mistaken by a beautiful mistress (looking for riches) as a possible prospect..so she makes love to him. On his end, he is smitten by her beauty. Alas, when Irene discovers that the fellow is nothing but a hotel employee...she can't wait to leave him or retaliate. But here's the catch: when this same bartender - through fortune (or misfortune) - becomes a gigolo to a rich woman in the very same hotel where she is playing the men..now suddenly the bartender becomes ""really"" interesting. After all, both of them can compare notes and strategies without being anything but who they really are.A movie like this would overplay the ""sex"" angle...considering howbreathtakingly beautiful Audrey Tautou is. But the director is moresuccessful by using restraint in the romantic scenes. Yes, for entertainment like a sparkling champagne, do try this film"
3,Priceless,"Priceless is a French romantic comedy with an abundance of sight gags.It is best viewed in a group. The reactions of American teens tothe situations in the movie were, indeed, priceless to me. The videoscenery on the Riviera is beautiful. The reactions of the Jean characterin several scenes emphasizes the humor."
4,An enjoyably vacuous Riveria romp...,"""Priceless"" won't tax your brain cells too much as it meanders through its story about two people bent on exploiting what's on offer from the French Rivieria's rich wanting readily available companionship & sex... a storyline that's been used before, most notably in ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"". Not a great deal happens, what does is fairly predictable and there's no attempt to explore the impacts of these strange relationships on those involved. Bad news then? Well, not really, because ""Priceless"" isn't and doesn't pretend to be anything more than (as a previous reviewer so aptly put it) an enjoyably sweet ""soufflé"" - a beguilingly attractive but in the end fairly vacuous romp through the Riviera's classiest and most beautiful locations. And, if you're prepared to take it for what it is, it's a perfectly enjoyable and entertaining way to spend an hour and a half or so of your time."
3,Good book but a little boring,"I think that this book had a lot of promise, I like the premise of following a family for 1000years, but it lacked action and for an 800page book it became more of the same just with different names."
2,Duplication,"""Dublin"" = beautifully written as all Rutherfurd books are, but why in heaven's name is it identical to ""Princes of Ireland""? I felt cheated having just read the story in ""Princes of Ireland"". What was in this author's mind - money from just another book? I'll be careful next I buy his books. The same story under the guise of a different title is not nice!"
3,"WARNING: Same book as ""The Princes of Ireland""","I love all of the books by this author but...this is the same book as ""The Princes of Ireland""! That's VERY misleading!!!"
1,Don't Bother,This is mostly jingles they hoped to sell - really has nothing to do with the Soft Machine... There is even a bit that that sounds incredibly similar to the theme song to the Mary Tyler Moore show...
3,Not that much of a trainweck.,"This album is a big lackluster and features fluffy easy going musical wallpaper compositions. But actually this album isn't that bad depending on taste of music, but tracks like Melinda and Little Miss B makes you want to say ""Can it get any worse?"". This album also shows Karl Jenkins stance as a flute player which is impressive on Travelogue. This album features John Etheridge as permanent replacement,but don't look for his intensifying solos here. If you're really interested on 1970's jingles for radio and tv, this is a jewel. Whether or not any of these songs got used for these purposes, I can not say, but its still of some interest. Highlights are Jombles,A Little Foating Music and Sam's Short Shuffle. Two and a half stars really."
5,Fasinating piece of surpressed history.,This books is a must read for the underground historian. What is most fascinating about it is the cossacks wanted to join the Germans in their fight against the Communist but Hitler turned them down. Some of the German field commanders did not tell Hitler and fought along side the Germans. This is only one of the interesting situations not commonly discussed in WW II history.
1,This CD is Copy Controlled!!,"I recieved this album as a gift and was excited because it seemed like a good album. However, I was very disappointed to find out that this album is Copy Controlled, which means that I cannot copy the tracks onto my computer. This is the way I listen to ALL of my music, in fact, I don't even own an ordinary CD player. Because I cannot rip the tracks onto my computer to play them with Winamp or another mp3 software, I probably will not listen to them at all. The Copy Controlled technology was put in place to stop pirating, but will also cause honest customers like myself to stop buying CDs altogether. I will never buy a disk that is Copy Controlled, and if all labels start doing it, then I will not buy CDs at all."
5,"Good fan, and good service...","The 92mm fans are not as easy to acquire as they used to be. I found these from this seller and received them a lot quicker than I expected. I ordered 3 fans, all 3 were new, and in the original packaging. I give the seller and the parts two thumbs up."
3,An OK Fan,"It is easy to install and moves the air OK, but it is noisy. I finally sent it back due to excessive noise."
2,Noisy and wiring too short,"The fan is too noisy. Also, I was unable to connect it to the motherboard because the supplied wiring was too short. I had to use the 4 pin extension cable that had to be connected to a cable from the power supply. Thus, my motherboard is not able to control the fan speed. I have subsequently ordered an extension cable that can connect to the motherboard. I will then decide whether I need to replace this fan."
4,David Newton Should Be Better Known in USA,"David Newton is a talented pianist whom I first heard on CD's backing Stacey Kent with husband, Jim Tomlinson. His work as a back-up musician made me want to hear more of his work, and this solo CD of songs all containing ""Eyes"" in the titles is a gem. You must become acquainted with this fine musician!"
5,My Review,"This book is an amazing book, about a girl and her family that struggles after the Holocaust. I suggest you read I have Lived a Thousand Years, before you read this book. In the book, I Have Lived a Thousand Years it introduces you to the characters and tells about their life before and during the holocaust. This book, My Bridges of Hope: Searching for Life and Love After Auschwitz, is amazing book that tells the story of Elli Friedmann's life after the holocaust has took place, and the many adventures along the way. I suggest that you read this book, after you have read the first one."
3,I like the series,I got the first two books and then got this one!! I havent gotten a chance to read this book but I cant wait!!
3,"Broad coverage, but dry as a bone.","""Maximizing Your ERP System"" is broad in its coverage, but skeletal. It is one dry read, like an outline with a lot of repeated boilerplate blown in where the meat was supposed to be. It lays out some details excrutiatingly (like the composition of the manufacturing database) but there's no sense of life or color to hold things together. More of a dictionary than a treatise, I recommend it for the vocabulary you might gain, but don't plan to enjoy it."
1,Absolutely Terrible Phone!!!,"I bought this phone from a local merchant to replace the 2.4ghz phone that I had before. I thought the 5.8ghz would provide better reception, better distance, etc. WRONG!! I mirror the thoughts of a previous reviewer...this is the worst phone I have ever owned.Terrible static, unbelievably short range and poor quality throughout. The only redeeming feature is the easy to read screen, but there is no way that that offsets all the negatives. Avoid at all costs."
1,Cheap phone - cheap quality,"One of the worst phones I have ever wasted money on. Lousy voice quality, unbearable static, and to ice the cake the phone died after only 3 mos. Invest a few more $$ into something of better quality."
3,"Gets the job done, but have no attack whatsoever.","These mallets are decent, but I have one huge problem: the attack on these mallets is terrible. However, some pieces may require a softer mallet, but mine didn't. If these fit your purpose, by all means buy em. But, if you're looking for a nice solid mallet with a good attack, I recommend the M115s over these."
3,Live album,"Originally released in 1978, ""Live at Last"" was Steeleye's first live album, and their last album before disbanding for a (thankfully) brief period.There is little to gripe about here, but at the same time little to revel in. What we have he is a good, but by and large, not a remarkable chronicle of the band's final concert before the hiatus.Contained here are eight songs. Of them three are live version of songs that are better represented by their studio counterparts (""Saucy Sailor"" in particular works better in the studio version from the ""Below The Salt"" album and pairing it with ""Black Freighter"" from ""Storm Force Ten"" probably worked better on paper then in reality).The rest of the album is made up of songs never released on any of their studio albums, which should make this package of interest to fans. Even if few of these tracks are really essential, ""Montrose"" is exciting.One the whole a worthy, but not totally essential Steeleye effort."
2,"Oh, well. But. . .","I got these headphones to use in a motorcycle helmet. I pulled the ear loops and put the speakers in my helmet, but sadly couldn't hear them at anything over 30 mph. They work fine as headphones but don't do what I wanted.Oh, well."
3,Not what I was hoping for,You get what you pay for... even from Koss.I don't really like the idea of jamming earphones INTO my ears and the earbuds never stay where I like. But these over the ear phones don't live up to Koss standards. I'm using some $16 Sony in-ear units like theseSony MDREX10LP/BLK In-Ear Headphonesand they sound better.
3,Good sound... but only for big ears.,"The sound is very good. But I am returning them because they are not comfortable for my ears.I don't have big ears but they are not the smallest neither. I try to fix these earphones but it is impossible to make them fit, they feel loose and if I move too much (like in exercising) then they fall.However they are just perfect for people with big ears because, as I said, the sound is very good."
1,"Bulky, uncomfortable, hard to put on, keep on, (and some how) take off and I lost the removable ear piece.","The piece the hold the head phone onto the ear does not swivel, so I never figured out a easy way to put these on. I had to stretch it to get it firmly on my ear. Then once I got them on I tried to leave them on as long as possible because they were such a pain to put on and remove. So I would just unplug them from the computer and walk around with them on. But they were big and bulky and not comfortable. Plus they don't stay on all that well.So piece not only doesn't swivel it also comes off. Which I originally thought was a good idea. It is not. After a week and half of having these headphones the piece fell off, I haven't seen them since. The head phones are now more useless then they were before."
3,This is horrible. The Sony MDR-XD200 is better.,"The sound with the Koss KSC75 is very high pitched and treble. Very little bass. and the sound is not immersive. It sounds tiny. I wish I could return my Koss. These sound worse than my cheap old sony earbuds. Plus, I got the Sony MDR-XD200 and you could tell there is a huge difference. I feel surrounded with a wide range of sounds and the bass and treble is perfect."
4,wow what quality,"this is great for people who want high quality headphone, this headphone r one of them unfortuntly these headphone r open air so it can be difficult to hear when there alot of noise outside including the appearance it not so great. beside that it good"
3,"It's good, not excellent","I like the earphone, but not the shape. The shape bothers me a lot. Not convenient to put on ears."
2,Koss earphones,"It is difficult to keep the earphones on when running. I gave a pair to a friend as a present and he said the same. Also, the ear pieces come apart and are hard to get back on and can get lost easily. This happenned to both me and and my son."
1,terrible,These headphones are terrible.. two pairs broke in less than 1 month.. if you like garbage.. please buy these
2,"Sounds great, but still sucks","I know, that is a bit sophomoric. However, I am through dealing with these headphones. The connection bar, that other similar models have, being absent proves more of an irritant than I had expected. One really needs to curl these around your ears to set properly. And if you don't do it right, they just pop right off. I remove them a dozen times a day so that gets annoying. Connected models sit more nicely on the back of your head and are much easier to deal with.But like I said, they sound great."
2,"Too quiet, ear pieces fall off easily","This headphones are just too quiet and the ear pieces have a tendency to fall off when stored in a backpack or pocket. I expected more from Koss, in the past they've delivered better products than this."
2,Not Impressed...,"I went to pick one up from Radio Shack during my lunch break, and i know i'll be returning it already when i get off work. The sound is fine, but it doesn't stand out. It feels loose and uncomfortable over my ear, plus it doesn't hold the music well. I'm using it at work and i'm afraid to crank it up b/c you can totally hear them. I wouldn't recommend these for runners either."
2,Not too pleased,"These headphones would be great if I had the ears of a 70 year old man. Too bad they want to fall off because they do have a really good sound. I have tried to bend and pry, but can't get the right fit. If kids called you ""Dumbo"" when growing up, you shouldn't pass these up."
3,Slightly disappointed,This product was recommended on a few sites as great for portable MP3 players and on the go listening. I primarily use this product for my Nintendo DS and they produce a low buzzing sound when no sound is playing and a crunch sound when certain notes are hit in the music or games I'm listening to. I have only had them for a month and they already sound like a speaker has been blown (and I don't try to push beyond normal limits).
1,Waste of money,"I bought these headphones in the hopes they'd be similar to the RCA headphones that came with my mp3 player. They didn't come close. They have no flexibility, and I was unable to fit them comfortably around my ears. I ended up buying another set from another brand."
2,Returned product,"This product is more bulky than shown in the picture, so I had to return it. I didn't even open it to try the usability or sound."
2,My experience was different...,"These headphones sound awful to me. At first, I thought they were OK, but then I noticed subtle, strange noises mixed in with my favorite songs on my iPod. They seem to add digital distortion, which ends up sounding like electronic crickets or additional synthesizer tones mixed in with the playback. After I was aware of it, I couldn't ignore it. The portability is good, the price is great, but the sound is basically unlistenable to me. I am giving 2 stars because of the warranty, which is great to have, and everyone who's taken Koss up on it seems to be happy."
1,earphone review,Takes two hands to put on so only use when you have lots of pockets. Also they keep coming apart at the joint so don;t get in hurry or tight space. And any outside noise is going to intrude. Not sure why I bought these but maybe the Salvation Army will be glad to have them.
2,Not at all what I expected!,"I love headphones I have quite a few of them too. But I have yet to find a great headphone for very cheap. I would have to say my friends Jbuds are the best ones I've listened to. These headphones are no worth it. There very hard to put on plus the little thing that holds the two pieces together falls off a lot which is very annoying.Sound Quality: These are the worst headphones ever if there is even a little noise around you. I ended up having to turn the volume up all the way because of it. Even driving in the car I decide to put my ipod in while the radio's playing very low, Cant here anything but the radio. Plus the bass is not very good it falls out especially in songs with a big beat.Cable: The Cord is awful it gets tangled just about every time you use it. But one thing I do like about it is the strait earphone jack compared to the L shaped one.These do have a stylish look to them. But the look isn't sound."
1,Disappointed,"I had headphones similar to these so when they broke I came here and saw all the good reviews for these headphones and thought they would be a good replacement. But these are not.The build makes it tight to get these on your ears and they pinch my ears to the point that my ears hurt. I'm a small girl so I don't think I have giant ears ... I just didn't expect that and it's just not comfortable. My ears also feel itchy wearing these and it's hard to fix that with how the build is. It seems like these could break easy.There is a lot of base. If you like base then that will be good for you. It's not overwhelming.I wont buy them again in the future. I wanted this style of headphones because my last pair as very comfortable, but these are not. I feel frustrated."
3,Very Uncomfortable,"I've always been a fan of Koss headphones because of the great warranty and their good sound for the money. I was looking for headphones which were not earbuds (they fall out of my ears) and would store compactly. What I found, however, is that it was virtually impossible for me to get this type of earphone on my ears! I tried pulling my ears through the gaps, rotating the clips, and standing in front of the mirror so I could see what I was doing. The one time I finally got them ""installed"", the sound seemed very good, but they were not particularly comfortable. So, I gave them to my wife and she seems able to wear them without the discomfort I experienced. I'm still a fan of Koss headphones but, in the future I'll try them for comfort before I buy!"
1,junk,"I ordered these headphones to use in place of earbuds, which hurt my ears. They were difficult to get in place, but once they were around my ears they were very comfortable. With regard to sound quality, the noise reduction was very good but the volume level was poor. Not that I wanted the volume super loud, but the volume level on a scale from 1-10 was a 5 at best. Here's the major problem: one of the ear clips snapped off the fourth time I used them. So...don't waste your money."
4,Good alternative to earbuds,"I had always been an earbud fan but was yearning to try and over the ear model. Having used numerous headsets with various cell phones and bluetooth devices I must say these are THE MOST comfortable over-the-ear headphones I have ever used. I have had a number of associates try them as well with similar comments regarding how weightless they are and easy they are to fit to the ear. Sound is full for a headset, not recommended for the audiophile. These are not noise blocking so not recommended for the husband trying to drown out the nagging wife. (But very good for the office when you need to respond to someone that walks up behind you.)"
3,"Inexpensive, sound good, but not for very long","The headphones sound good and are very portable. However, I find they really begin to hurt my ears after about 45 minutes. If your listening is confined to short walks, etc. these will suit you fine. But look elsewhere if you'll be listening in longer bouts. On the other hand, they are so inexpensive, for the quality they are a good buy for times you do not want the in-ear headphones."
3,very comfortable,These headphones are very comfortable. I find them somewhat hard to put on. I have had some problems with the ear piece coming off.
4,Koss KSC75 user review,"Ok, You might have read a lot of good things about this pair of headphones but it does have some negative aspects to it. A lot of people focus on its sound quality and bass and use that as big positives of this headphone.I have used it for a month and got to know about it better now.PositivesSound quality - it is a gem, very satisfactory so no doubt a great headphone for awesome sound quality.Looks - great, doesn't really look cheap according to the price you payNegatives1. It is just a little delicate so you have to be careful in use2. Extended hours of use will cause slight pain on your ears where the clip rests on it.3. Bass not too much but not bad either.Hope that helps"
5,KOSS HEADPHONES,"THE HEADPHONES WORK GREAT UNLESS YOU ARE IN A PLACE WITH VERY LOUD BACKGROUND SOUNDS,LIKE RIDING A LAWN MOWER ETC."
4,Good sound quality and fit for the price,These headphones work well and deliver sound better than you would expect for the price. I wear them from running and my only complaint is that I'd like them to adjust a little tighter although they aren't annoying loose. This purchase is a no-brainer!
3,Don't fit well under glasses,"This headphones are a strong value. They sound fine. They don't fit that well although the clip is bendable and if you mess with it you can get it relatively snug. They never feel really solidly on and will fall of easily. If you have glasses you will find the very large clip annoying and cumbersome, requiring removal of glasses to get a solid fit. I like my old Sonys more."
2,Nah,"They have really annoying clips that snap off. Once u lose one set, the headphones are useless. I would go with the similar phones from Sony."
2,"Hard to Put On; Not Very Comfy, Either","Sound quality is fine - nothing outstanding. This is the second set of over-the-ear ear-clip style ear phones I've had, the first being by Sony. By comparison, these are very hard to put on my ears without the ear clip popping off. It goes back on, but getting it to stay on during installation on the ear makes using these earphones too frustrating and fussy to bother with. Especially since sound quality and comfort are both middle of the road."
3,work good,"they work good for the price comfortable enough. I thought they would be the flip open kind though, but they are not. I wanted something I could flip open so I could hear people talk without having to constantly take them on and off my ear. Other than that they are good cheap headphones for at work."
4,Personal Favorite,"Koss clip-on headphones have been my preferred earphones for years now. I am not a fan of bulky full headphones when I'm on the go and ear buds tend to fall out of my ears which can be annoying, therefore I prefer the clip on earphones.Although these earphones can be very tight initially when worn for a half hour or more you can bend the clips a bit to adjust the comfort level without causing them any damage. The clips are also removable and though they have snapped off when dropped on the ground (and easily snapped back on without damage) I have never had them snap off during normal use.The sound is also clearer in my opinion than what I have experienced with ear buds and singles out more individual instrumentation.My only negative is that like all headphones they succumb to wear and tear over time which of course can be made shorter or lengthier depending on the care one exercises with them."
4,Hideous but good,They are even uglier in person but they sound very good and the quality is reasonable too. Definitely a good value for twelve and a half bucks.This design allows you to rest your head on a pillow without the discomfort that earbuds cause.
2,Didn't last,"I bought these headphones to use for cycling. They fit snugly on my ear and did a nice job of cutting the wind sound. This allowed music and podcasts to be listened to clearly without too much volume, so that I could also easily hear the traffic. Unfortunately, a mere 34 days after purchase (just long enough that I couldn't return them), one headphone inexplicably stopped working. Was it a fluke or are do you get what you pay for (in this case, 34 days of listening)."
5,Great Headphones,"These headphones sound amazing for their price point. They share the same drivers as the Koss PortaPro, except these have a titanium coating so their sound is brighter with slightly less bass. They will need some burn-in to sound their best, but are decent even before burn-in. Personally I have no problems with the ear-clip design and they are very comfortable for me. These are a very good deal, easily the best sub $30 headphones I have heard.Edit: I have given these to a friend and he loves how the transparent sound doesn't block out outside sounds."
5,Excellent sound for the price,"Up until I purchased these Koss KSC75 headphones, I had only used Apple headphones with my iPods. Wow, what a difference! They produce excellent sound and they are very comfortable. They are of course ugly as sin and the cord could be a little longer but you just can't beat them for the price. I run with these headphones and they never fall off and they cover my ears so they keep my ears warm on cold, winter days."
1,Flimsy and uncomfortable,"While these headphones sound REALLY good, they are very uncomfortable. They are hard to get on and most people I know that tried mine with my MP3 player hate them on fit alone. What really makes these a 1-star item is the durability. I went through 2 sets of these both only lasted about 5-6 uses. The first ones I just took off normally next day they didn't work, I didn't abuse them in any way but I liked the sound and got a 2nd set. The 2nd set I did accidentally yank when the wire got caught by my elbow while jogging, it wasn't harsh but it was a mild tug. From then on one side kept cutting out. I might try soldering the connection back in if I can get to it but these things just break too easy for me to recommend. I had cheaper headphones take 10x the amount of abuse and still work fine."
3,a little underwhelmed,"Maybe my expectations were too high from the start, but these headphones were just OK. After reading multiple reviews of headphones, including several on this particular model/brand, I was expecting more. Many reviewers had nothing but great things to say about this product. After trying them out, I was satisfied, but certainly not blown away. The sporty design does do away with the headband, which is comfortable enough. The sound is good, but not spectacular.Some cons:- If the sound is turned up moderate-high, other people around can hear the sound as well.- The design allows the earpiece to break off under pressure (but these are easily re-attachable)"
5,By Far the Star at its Price Point,"For the dollar, this is by far the best deal in the headphone world. Transparent sound with a bit of a midrange boost, portability, and good looks all in a package that costs about as much as a CD. You can't go wrong with these wonderful little guys. The clip is sturdily designed, and the back of the drivers is interchangable with the drivers from the PortaPro headband, so they are easily swapped (a modification I highly recommend).Ive heard headphones costing 50 times as much as these, and enjoyed the sound coming out of the KSC-75 more. Sure, sacrifices are made to ensure low cost, but these are completely forgivable. I couldnt recommend these wonderful little headphones any more."
1,Broke in 2 weeks,"The left earphone doesn't work after 2 weeks of barely any use. Used to love my old koss ones that were kinda like this, those ones lasted about 2 years."
2,One star for each pair I bought that became defective within a few months of use,"I love these headphones. They're light and cheap and sound great. The bass frequencies come through extremely competently. But from my experience they're also unreliable. The first pair I bought worked for a few weeks and then one of the phones stopped transmitting sound entirely. I thought I'd just bought a dud or accidentally yanked a wire or something, and I ordered another pair. These lasted about two months until the speaker in one of the phones apparently blew. Now I hear a crackle with bass frequencies in that ear. It costs nearly half the price of the headphones to send them to Koss for repair, and factoring in shipping and repair time, it would be easier to just buy another new pair from Amazon and have them at your door in a week. But after two successive defective pairs, I doubt I'll be going in for a third."
4,"Good sound, slightly odd looking","I purchased these to run with, as the ear buds fell out. For running and exercising these things work excellently. Good sound, comfortable, and (most importantly) they don't fall out. Now when I wear them to the gym I notice they look a bit odd as they follow your ear contours and thus stick out a bit - but considering all the other weird outfits that are at the gym I feel fully comfortable with these on."
3,Don't fit very well,"I used to have a pair of similar headphones by Panasonic that I absolutely loved. These Koss were meant to be a replacement after I wore the others into the ground. I chose the Koss because of the great reviews (from both users and headphone review sites) and because they seemed similar to my Panasonics. The Panasonics used a single piece of molded plastic for the ear clip and the part that held the actual headphone. These Koss headphones, however, have a bulky, pivoting ear clip. I could never get these to fit comfortably or securely - one shake of my head (even just to say ""no"" to someone) and they would fall off. I tried all sorts of adjustments until I finally brought out the pliers and bent the clip. I considered super-gluing the clip so it wouldn't pivot loose anymore. Finally I just bought a pair of wrap-behind Sennheisers."
4,really good headphones--MUCH better than Koss sparkplugs,"These are really quality headphones. I'm so happy with them. They are a little weird to put on, but they are comfortable once on and do a very good job keeping out ambient noise.I had bought the Koss sparkplugs and they were TERRIBLE. A good idea that was not well executed. Don't buy them--buy these."
5,Great Headphones!,These are great Headphones for the money; the sound is very good and they are very comfortable. They can be used for hours without feeling any pain or disconfort. 5 stars.
4,"Low Price, Great Quality","The fact that these things sound this good for under $20 is amazing. Unfortunately, the ear clips can be very annoying--they're too tight and not easily adjusted."
2,Difficult to wear,"I've had many of this type headphone over the years. This model is very difficult to wear, comes apart, tough to get on my ears. The sound quality is just OK."
5,Good Value,Good sound quality for the price. Great Value. Perfect for on the go. Isolation is a bit lacking and a little adjustment is needed for them to achieve optimal sound.
4,Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones,Use these in the gym on a treadmill. The sound is great. I wish they were a little tighter around the ears
2,Worth the money,Clip that holds the ear is too tight. I moved it a little and it fell down somewhere and now i cannot use it. Otherwise it is worth what you spend
2,Not a very good design,I won't be buying another set of these earclip headphones. They don't fit very tight around the ears at all and they always feel like they're going to fall off.
4,Great sound quality but very ugly!,"These work great for listening to music, movies and games, and their sound quality surpasses that of most any in-box included headphones. For the price, they are a great buy! Unfortunately, though, you will *not* want to wear these out of the house, they are extremely dorky looking."
2,Design flaw,"Sound quality is fine, but there is a design flaw. The ear clips are designed to be detachable, I guess so that they will just come off instead of breaking if it gets jostled in your bag. That's fine, but they get detached much too easily - sometimes just with the motion of putting them on your ear. When I take the headphones off, one of the clips will often fall to the floor. I have not lost one yet, but it's probably going to happen before too long at this rate, and once that happens the headphones will be useless because there will be nothing to hold it to the ear anymore. Too bad, because otherwise the quality is good!"
1,I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.,"I bought this headphone a while ago mostly because there were a lot of good ratings, and comments about the product.When I first got it, I was excited. But after a couple days, I didn't like it at all.I did not like any feature of this product.It didn't fit my ears at all. It would slip away from my ear a few seconds after I put them on.It was very annoying. And a few days later, white plastic one from the headphone broke.I put them back on but ever since then, they would fall off whenever I tried to put them on.I still have the headphone but I don't use it anymore.If you were thinking about getting one, I will recommend you to get some other product!"
3,Has some flaws,"The quality of these headphones are good, but not on my music player in which hey also sound muffled or unclear. I'm not sure why. The clips also snap off a lot and are hard to put back on. On my laptop however, the sound is wonderful. I would rate these four stars but the hooks snap off way too easily!"
3,"Great Sound, Not Durable","These headphones sound great! However, the place where the ear piece attaches to the speaker is not secure and is constantly popping out. It's easy to pop it back in, but I shouldn't have to. I do love the sound, but I fear I'm going to lose the piece and thus render the headphones worthless, or that the small plastic surrounding the attachment point will fracture."
4,"Great headphones with big sound, decent comfort","These are good headphones. The sound is quite good, better than expected. They're very light and portable, and I'm impressed at how little the wires tangle; some earbuds have flimsy wires that catch and tangle all over, but these Koss cables seem to be somewhat tangle resistant. Due to the ear clip design they still catch on the cables a bit, though, and it's too bad there's no accounting in the design for cable roll-up or storage. Would be nice if they had a case or some way to wind up the cables.For comfort, these are OK but could be better, I'd say 3 out of 5 stars for comfort.All around, a very solid investment and a purchase I'm quite happy with!"
4,"Nice sound, a bit loose on my ears...","I do like the sound of these, but one of them feels like it will fall off when I am working out."
4,First impressions,"Wow, out of the box they sound great. Got these for running in, but haven't had a chance to do that. So far though they fit comfortably and sound great. I have owned a pair of Shure in-ear (broke), V-moda (broke), Sennheiser-Adidas in-ear (broke), and Grado (still working hard). Grados are the best, but these are pretty nice. Better sound then the V-Moda and Senn."
3,"Sound is good, uncomfortable and hard to wear","The sound is very good on these cheap buds. Unfortunately they are not very easy to put on. I may be doing it wrong, but the earbuds don't slide easily onto my ears. Once on they are okay, but they can be uncomfortable if worn for a while. It may be because I am not putting them on correctly, but it is a little annoying."
3,VOLUME CONTROL IS NOT AS PROVIDED,"HAVE NO CONTROL OF VOLUMEI like the SOUND THE BEST I'VE HEARD THIS KIND, BUT NO MEETS VOLUME CONTROL AS PROVIDEDABOVE WAS THE SAME IN THE PICTURE APPEARS TO CONTROL AND SENT WITHOUT VOLUME CONTROL AND I HAVE SENT THE SAME WAY 4"
2,Not so great,"I know I can't expect concert theater sound for this price, but I could barely hear the music through these phones. At the gym, on the stationary bikes, I had to press the headphones against my ear for decent sound. I don't think they're adjustable. If they are, I couldn't figure it out. I purchased based on the ratings, but they didn't work for me."
2,"Good sound, poor design","Very good sound at such a low price. However, the earclip kept coming off the earphone and eventually was lost forever. Also, the cord should have a guide on it to prevent it from getting very tangled. I returned the item and was fully refunded."
3,Aaargh!,"These headphones are incredible. They sound amazing, they fit well, and they're cheap. BUT, those stupid little ear clips are detachable. They always fall off in my bag, and then I can't tell which ear is left and which is right. Plus, I've lost two sets of ear clips in one year. I give up."
4,"Great sound, they stay on, they're comfy, BUT...","...they're a little dorky looking. They protrude out from my ears more than I'd expected - I thought they might lay a bit flatter than they do, so I'm feeling like I've got Clark Gable ears. Other than that bit of superficiality, I love them. Great sound and they stay put. Getting them on takes a bit of practice, but it's far less work initially than, say, putting in noise-cancelling ear buds.Oh, and a lifetime warranty!"
2,$9.00 for Lifetime Warranty,"I gave these to my girlfriend for Christmas. One speaker stopped working in May. She does put them in the pocket of her backpack, but that seems like normal use for a headphone. I paid $15 originally and I looked up the warranty from Koss which says to send $9 for the return shipping. They are just charging for a new headset."
1,Good while it lasts,"I bought these just a couple of months ago to go with an MP3 player I bought for work. I decided on these head phones because I cannot wear those little ear buds. Well, these head phones were wonderful, however they did not last. I work in an office, I don't move around, I sit at my desk, one side has already quit working. Now I am just waiting on the other side to quit also. Very disappointed in this product. I expected a better quality."
1,Poor Quality Earphones,"I purchased this set after reading the excellent reviews here on Amazon. After about a week, the right unit developed a crackle/buzzing that is absolutely unbearable, and within a month the left speaker suffered the same fate. I generally listen to original film scores and ""classical"" music, both of which are often subtle, and the crackle absolutely ruins the music. One would assume it would only occur with low frequency sound, but this isn't the case. Blasting brass and even piano sonatas can result in the same unremitting buzz at modest volumes (I enjoy my hearing, so I never turn the volume very high). I will send in for another pair when I return to the country, but these are not worth the price. If sound quality is a priority for you (as it is for me), ear buds and these clip on sets will not suffice, so endure the awkward glances and get a set of full-size headphones (many collapsible models are made for transport)."
4,Good stereo sound,"I like the stereo sound which is good. It is intended for use with my Sport MP3 player and the clip is good for keeping it in place. I don't like the sponge cover of the headphone. It may make me feeling hot and it needs replacement in the future. If it is smooth and without the cover, I would like it better."
4,Lightweight & relatively comfortable,"Maybe it's my small ears, but sometimes the headphones don't feel like they are secure on my ears. I feel like I have to tweak them for a little so that they feel safe and comfortable. Usually, though, once I've messed around with them for a little, they will feel ok...just not a real quick installation! The sound is good once they are in place."
3,I am clumsy and also disorganized. This is a bad product for me.,"The sound quality on these is great. They sit a bit farther away from my ear than is ideal (when wearing a knit cap, I look ridiculous unless I tuck it behind my headphones, and that still looks a bit ridiculous). But the truly tragic thing is, the part that actually clips to your ear breaks off. This is a feature, not a bug! Because it's designed to break off, and is easily reattached. Um, except I am not to be trusted with multiple parts and keep on @&*$#*$%(^$^!! losing the part that clips to my ear, rendering the rest of it useless. I would not have bought these if I had realized that carelessly stuffing them into a pocket would result in me pulling out 7/8ths of the headphones next time around. I am disgruntled!"
3,Be careful,"The headphones break off of their little ear holders easily. you can pop them back in, but it will never be exactly the same. These were pretty much exactly what I was looking for at the price, though they don't get awfully loud. I say they are pretty good, just a bit fragile."
4,Good replacement for KSC35's,I got these when my trusty 35's started wearing out. I'm no audiophile so I don't really hear a difference in the sound between the two (a good thing). My only complaint is that they don't seem to stay on my ears as well as the 35's did. They look much better though.
1,For sedentary use only,"I have been searching for a headphone solution for my walks/running. I must have smaller than normal ears but the ""sports"" clip was of zero use. I couldn't even walk at a slow pace without the headphones coming off my ears. I wouldn't even recommend these if your only ""activity"" would be sitting as they don't sit close to the ear, so sound is terrible."
3,Not For Kids,"I bought these for my two children for Christmas. Heard good reviews for them and decided they would be good for the kids. Well, they don't fit their ears. The headphones are too big. Now I have two pair of phones gathering dust in the house. Oh well..."
2,"Good sound, but it feels really cheap","I read a review saying that these headphones had excellent sound quality for the price, and that review was right. What they failed to mention was that these headphones were really uncomfortable and cheaply made. It's pretty awkward putting these on since the hooks that go on your ear are so stiff. I actually pulled one off trying to bend the metal into a more comfortable shape. If you're looking for cheap headphones, you'd be better off buying an earbud style(typically better quality at this price) or saving up for a more expensive set."
2,everything but the actual speaker section,"the sound is outstanding. but the ear clips are kind of tight, getting them bent to the point where they are comfortable is a bit of a pain and if you dont get it just right it will pinch the ear or slip off entirely. after so long the plastic/rubber coating on the wire leading out of the left earphone became very hard and began to break. and along with it so did the wire and the sound went kaput. i really miss these headphones, they were very clear crisp and produced incredible bass."
2,Headphones Fell Apart,"I bought these headphones about 2 months ago, and one of the ear clips fell off a couple of days ago. It had done this before and I was able to get it back on, but I couldn't this time. So after 2 months they went in the trash. They weren't very comfortable in the first place, and I definitely won't be buying Koss headphones again."
2,Ear clips does not hold up well.,"I will not recommend this Headphone. It has been difficult to use, the ear clip does not fit very well.I cannot really determine the sound quality, since the phone keeps falling off my ear."
1,How are these supposed to STAY wrapped around the aer?,"Really? Such good marks? I have tried these headphones for over a month now while working out, and for the life of me, I can't get them to stay put! Good sound, terrible fit."
2,2 words: sound leakage,"i didn't like them because of the sound leakage, and if you put them to a volume without sound leakage the volume is way too low... the sound quality was pretty good though"
3,right side lost sound when i was running on treadmill,"that is what happened,i was listening to music when i was working out on the treadmill by this phone, the right side headphone stopped working, and lost sound since.anyway i've used this phone for half a year, so $15 for this, maybe alright?"
4,"good,cheap upgrade from earbuds","I bought this for my ipod, and it is a cheap and worthwhile upgrade from the earbuds. I am not a music aficionado that can distinguish minute details in sound, but I can say without a doubt that the ipod earbuds don't do justice to the music.I bought these headphones because they had good reviews from customers and they were cheap. The first few times I wore them, the outer part of my ear lobe got red and painful, but after a couple of days wearing them, the clip doesn't seems to get looser. It's still not something I would call comfortable."
4,"Different cable, much thicker","I bought this updated model to replace my KSC-50 because they are lighter and because the foam pads may wear away soon. Yes, they sound as good, but the cables are dual-conductor type instead of the single-wrapped, super thin kind on the KSC-50. The foam pad is thinner and less durable. The drivers look good, but the thick(er) cables make it look cheap, and easier to tangle, too."
1,Only for people with big ears!,"My ears are normal size and these do not fit at all. They are very loose and large. I cannot vouch for the sound of them very well because they were bounching around and falling off. There is no way to adjust them to make them fit better. Bad design, too much room between around the ear piece and speaker."
5,Got an ipod ? get these headphones !!!,"These headphones solve the lack of bass that the ipods are notorious for. The frequency response on these babies is 15-25,000Hz. Your ipod will rock !!"
1,Falls apart way too easily,It comes apart way too easily making it easy to lose. Super annoying to get on ears. I have never written a review but felt the need bc this product sucked so much.
4,Uncomfortable but great sound and price,"So damn cheap. The bass is a little overemphasized, but that's what you wanted you filthy mammal. Does NOT feel good on cartilage-ears."
2,Nothing mind-blowing as many rewievs try to assert,"I bought this stereophones nearly one month ago, waited several days in a hope that after ''burning'' sound would became more ''better'' yes it changed little bit but nothing I can call improvement.First I would mention my background I am not audio professional, listening classical music and have lot of good recordings in my audio library.Sound characteristic impression: The bass is not particularly deep 20-50 Hz is nearly nonexistent, also it suffers punchy and annoying mid bass. I hated S and SH overpowered sounds in vocal performance. 2 hours is maximum for me to listen on these more than that my ears are annoyed. I would call it sharp sounding.If your budget is below 15$ you can try but I don't recommend it for general listeningVery Best"
2,Disappointed b/c of high hopes,"I heard good things about Koss and was excited to try a new line of earclip headphones for my workouts. I immediately heard a difference in sound quality compared to my old Philips in the same price range, but alas, the construction is rather shoddy. Specifically, the ear clips were way too loose to start, and when I attempted to adjust them, the hooks fell off and have been popping off ever since.I'd love to keep them if they were only more sturdy but they completely fail their purpose as is. As far as I can tell from the specs, the next bump up in the Koss line has only this difference but doubles in price for what should be a very simple and basic feature. I've had these earphones for less than 30 days and the manufacturer still wanted my return to count for less than its purchase value toward an upgrade. Can't think of anything to add but to shake my head. Could have been a great product but it's back to searching."
3,Minor Cable Problems,"The only problem I've had with these headphones (and it's happened with both pairs that I've bought) is with the external plastic insulation on the cable. The portion of the cable that's close to each earpiece can come in contact with your face and neck. Over time, the oil in your skin can cause that part of the cable to become shiny and stiff. Eventually, the insulation will crack and the wiring will break, especially if you're wrapping the headphone cables a lot.I've had the same problem with other brands of headphones, but not with others. I suspect that it has something to do with the type of plastic that's used to insulate the wiring.Still, for under $20.00, they're a good buy."
2,Uncomfortable,"I have normal ears. They are of average size and seemingly normal shape. These headphones, however, are easily some of the least comfortable ones I've ever tried. Sound quality is fine, but they're going back."
1,you get what you pay for,"For being a name brand I expected more. Way to flimzy, Speaker fell off ear mount . Ear mount does not go well for people that wear glasses. they actually hurt after awhile. Very cheap quality. Don't waste your money!! Buy the sony over ear head phones if you are lucky enough to find them. But hey if you have money to burn,like thowing it away and like pain go for it. you have been warned"
2,Breaks after 6 months,"I've bought two pairs of these within the past year. It's got excellent sound and it works with my iPod Touch (it's hard to find headphones that work properly with the Touch for some reason). However, the left earbud stopped working on the first pair after six months. I was hoping it was just bad luck, so I bought a new pair. Same thing happened. I see now in other people's reviews they've had the same problem. Take my advice: don't waste your money on these. Buy a pair of headphones that will last."
1,Broke within weeks,"Broke within a few weeks & now useless. The headphones stay on your ear via tension from a small component that rotates. After using it for a month, mine now rotates so far on one side that it no longer stays on my ear. Due to a design flaw I now have only one working headphone. Best of all, the 'warranty' requires you to pay Koss $7 for the repair and pay for shipping to them - in effect it's not a warranty at all, it's a repair service charging half the cost of the headphones plus shipping."
1,Broken after 3 uses,"I used these three times and can no longer hear anything from the left headphone. Other headphones work fine with the ipod and these headphones are mute in the left ear regardless of the source. I will attempt to return them for a replacement. Before they malfunctioned, they sounded fine and they are a comfortable pair to wear when running. The design keeps them in place without being painful or irritating. I hope my pair were just a bad set because I would like another pair which works."
4,Great headphones,"I love these headphones. Extremely comfortable and great sound. The only thing I'm mindful of is that I can't throw them in my bag without being protected to some extent like my previous (less-quality) headphones, but that's a minor issue."
2,Great headphones...if you have elephant ears,"I came across these headphones while looking for a cheap way to listen to music while running outside or on the treadmill. Cheap, lots of good reviews, can't go wrong, right? I can't complain about the sound quality but there is nothing else appealing about this product, at all. It feels cheap, the cords get tangled extremely easily, and most importantly, they don't fit on my ears. I have what I would consider to be ""normal"" or ""slightly smaller than normal"" ears, and these simply do not stay on while running. You can't adjust them either! I had some friends with varying ear sizes try them on as well while running and all came back with bad words concerning these headphones. I recommend not wasting your money on these."
2,Clip broke off,"These earphones worked decently for a couple of months although they were a bit snug. However, within a few months the clip kept coming of one of the headphone pieces, and I would have to keep snapping it back in place so I could wear them. Pretty soon, I lost the piece, and now I can't wear them."
1,Not comfortable,"Headphones are not comfortable and are larger than I expected. They clip onto your ear and after a few minutes, it hurts. I returned this item."
4,Man for $15 these headphones are good.,"These headphones are great for what I paid for them. They are fit right on my ears and I could imagine listening to music with them for hours. It may be comfortable, but they are loose so expect noise leakage.(thats also because of the ear padding too) They aren't very bassy but a little techno(not dubstep) or acoustic work fine. If you want some cheap comfortable headphones these are for you."
2,Not very good...,"I purchased these headphones two weeks ago, and I have to say I am not very impressed. The ear pieces are VERY easy to pop out. Simply snagging the cord while running will separate the pieces, and since I don't like stopping my treadmill runs in the middle, I am then stuck with only one ear piece. Additionally, the left ear piece already fits in so loose that it constantly bounces off my ear during workouts. All the positive reviews convinced me to buy these headphones, but I have to say they are not very good overall, especially for working out."
5,These are excellent!,"I can't use ear buds in my ears, so these are perfect. The deep base sound is awesome and price is great too! Highly recommended."
5,Simply Amazing!,"If you're looking for confortable, great sounding, cool looking, and under-priced headphones...look no further!"
4,"Great sound, OK fit and finish","I doubt you can find a better sounding set of 'phones in this price range. They take a little fuss to get them to fit properly, but they're quite nice once they do (the ""clip"" can be bent to give the best fit).They have real competition from the Sony MDR-Q22LP clip-ons, which are better designed mechanically but don't sound quite as nice, although they aren't too shabby for cheap 'phones either.UPDATE: I recently bought a second pair of the Sonys after my Koss clip-ons started cutting out in one ear. They don't really take the abuse that I give a set of portable 'phones. For a cheap, decent sounding pair to use at a desk, the Koss are still a good choice, but if you're going to be sticking them in pockets or backpacks, etc, I don't think they're durable enough. And yes, the Koss do sound better than the Sonys, but I'll just have to compromise for portable use."
3,Excellent but it hurts !,"These headphones offer excellent quality and stay on your ears tight.They are very good in general but they have two major negative features.1. They press your ears on certain points and after 10-15 minutes your ears hurt.2. Since they hang on to your ear, they do not apply enough pressure and a lot of the bass is lost.Thanks"
5,Great for the price,"Last workout headphones I got lasted a long time but didn't have any bass. They were about $35 so when I saw the price of these I was a little hesitant. They got such good reviews that I decided to give them a try. They are great headphones! The standard ear buds never stay in my ears and these didn't budge. The left side wiggles a little for me but I forgot about it after a couple seconds of running. It has a good bit of bass too. The only thing is that there's no way to adjust where the cord splits apart like most other headphones. Either way, def worth the price!"
1,too big looked like I had bunny ears,Fell apart first time I used and the fit was very uncomfortable. I thought they were smaller but too large for me
1,"Once you have their money, never give it back","I can't agree with the claims of good sound quality. These earphones have a pronounced crackle to them that kills any listening enjoyment. Also be aware that these fifteen dollar headphones have a warranty with a ten dollar return fee, plus postage."
4,Best deal under $20,"Do these things sound like a $200 pair of headphones? Hell no. But they have good, responsive bass, clear highs, and just overall sound great.I gave them four stars because they do leak quite a bit of sound, so it's hard to take them on the bus/wear them in a public place with other people around unless you're really keen on sharing your music with others. If you're going to be using them in private, though, or for jogging, working out, etc, I cannot recommend them highly enough."
2,Second pair to break in a year.,"This is the second pair to break in a year. Exact same thing happened to both. The left headphone seemed to have been severed from the wiring.The quality:price makes it a 2 star than a 1, but if I am purchasing things to have an expectancy of ~5 months, I would have not gotten Koss. What a shame."
3,okay,"They have good sound, but they don't sit snug on your ear and when you turn them up because of that, others can hear it. When I push them closer to my ears, the sound is MUCH better and clearer, but who wants to sit around with their hands pushing in their headphones in all day? Need to revisit the design I think."
2,"Great sounding, terribly uncomfortable.","These headphones sound great. There is treble and bass clarity, and it doesn't sound muddy when you turn the volume all the way up. Sound-wise, these are probably the best pair of portable headphones I have owned. However, since these headphones are so uncomfortable, it subtracted from the great sound. At first, when I took these out of the box and tried them on, they wouldn't fit and stay on. Also, the cushions were very itchy. After adjusting them for an hour, they fit a little better. I gave these headphones a chance and wore them for a week, hoping that I would get used to them. A week later though, they still didn't fit correctly and were itchy. When I say they don't fit, I mean when I shake my head (even lightly), they fall off. Despite its great sound, I ended up giving them to a friend to pay off a debt."
3,"sound quality is superb, if only it was equally comfortable",I bought this item after purchasing several headphones and returning them. The sound quality is excellent - especially you can hear powerfull bass. There is no hissing or background sound when the volume is tuned low. The problem is it is hard to wear around your ear- you have to adjust it several times and it doesnt fit very close to the ears. You feel as if it is going to fall for a while but then you get used to it . It is light and comfortable to wear for a long time. I assume the loose fit may be a problem for the jogging type but for casual walks and using at home it is perfect.
3,A controversial favorite,"The Koss KSC-75 has earned a good reputation as an inexpensive, fairly good-sounding ear clip. It sounds more balanced, and has more punch than is typical for its price range - with pleasing, non-booming bass, and an sound vastly far more agreeable than, say, Apple ear buds.= Some listeners have had success modifying the KSC-75 to increase definition somewhat, making it a popular ear bud of DIY types. It's cheap enough so hat mistakes aren't a big issue for most. I've found the sound changes small, but clearly an improvement.= The arms the go over your ears are rather delicate and have a tendency to break. Moreover, these arms provide too much pressure (for my ears, anyway); after an hour, the back of your ears may feel sore.In other words, the KSC-75 is a well-priced ear clip that surprises you with its decent sound."
4,A Fantastic Value,"As there are so many reviews already posted, I'm going to keep this brief and to the point. These phones boast great sound comparable to phones costing 4x as much, and are mighty comfortable to boot. Only the hardcore audiophiles would find dissatisfaction with the sound these produce. I have not personally experienced any problems with build quality, though it has been reported by other consumers a number of times. The phones seem competently built, but not meant for rough handling. By the reports that have come in, I get the feeling some duds have been sneaking past QA and into costumers hands, so that is something you may want to consider. However, at $15 you aren't exactly taking a big risk if you buy these, and I'd imagine Amazon would let you return them if they were defective.The Positive:$100 sound for $15Comfy!A much better alternative to those crummy earbudsThe Negative:You could get stuck with a crummy, fall-aparty pairWon't stand up to rough handling"
2,rather fragile,"the first time I put these on, the clip broke off from the main portion. This was a waste of money especially since I was just going to use it at work."
4,Misleading title,"These aren't really foldable headphones...just over-the-ear types. I will say that the sound quality from these is pretty nice for running, the gym, etc., but not if you want to drown out noise on an airplane or subway. Also, they fit very well over the ear, but some people may have a little trouble the first time they put them on, as the new clips are like eyeglass arms, but tighter.Overall, Koss has delivered yet another quality product. I've purchased nothing but Koss headphones (except for those free buds that come with most everything nowadays), and will continue with their products in the future."
3,"Great gym headphones, until they stopped working","These have been the only headphones I ever owned that I can run with and will not fall off. They clip onto your ear and are perfectly stable throughout my workouts. After about 45 minutes you can feel the pinch on your ears, because they secure so well. The sound quality is pretty good, with noticeable bass in certain songs. Unfortunately, just a couple weeks ago, the left headphone stopped outputting sound. I was really happy with these headphones, but then they broke. I purchased them March 2011 and they lasted until September 2011."
3,"Great sound, unfortunately it is fragile","I was very impressed with the sound when I first got them, certainly I don't think that you can find better sound for this kind of money, deep bass, clear mids, and very crisp treble. I certainly wasn't expected that much sound on this price range. Unfortunately, the design of the cabling isn't very smart, so it ends up being a very fragile product, it broke after a couple of weeks of use. I opened it up to see if it could be fixed, but it turns out that the conductor is not something that can be put back together, so you end up with a broken product without any abuse. Fortunately it is a cheap set, so you can do like I did, and get another set, being a lot more careful this time. If it was for sound alone, I would give it a 5, but unfortunately the design makes it too fragile."
4,Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones,"The sound is great...my only complaint is that when I'm up and about with the headphones on, they slip off my ears quite easily. A tighter fit would be much preferred!"
4,My new regular ear phone,"These are not all that durable, but with proper adjustment I can get them to stay for the gym or just a run. I do like having these on a head band most of the time. The sound is great, an open air system that has good bass, and clear and crisp highs. The sound is a 5 for a colored set. However the construction wasn't that great. I damaged my cord quickly and as you remove the clips they wear, a lot. So I try to keep them on just the clips now. The cord snagged loose with lite preaure. These are easy to take apart though so I fixed it. I am thinking about recabling these with a better cord. Best thing out there I think for this price"
3,"Decent sound, but a bit uncomfortable","I bought these for my iPod as a reasonably compact alternative to earbuds. I figured that an over-the-ear model would be less likely to further damage my already-somewhat-compromised hearing than another set of earbuds. These phones have quite decent sound quality, especially for the price. They reproduce highs and lows faithfully and without a lot of coloration. My only complaint is the fit and comfort. The earclips are quite stiff and it's rather difficult to put them on correctly (my ears are average sized -- neither huge nor tiny) and after a while they do not feel very comfortable. I think they would be better if the wire in the clips was thinner or more flexible and if the plastic covering the clips was softer and more padded. I can't speak yet regarding reliability, because I've only had them for a week, but they seem reasonably well-constructed given the price."
4,"Good Headphones, Questionable Durability","These headphones have great sound quality and are extremely comfortable. At first, the ear clips were too large for my ears and barely gripped the top of my ear. After some careful bending, I managed to shape the wires into a more effective shape. The ear clips also have a tendency to pop off of the earphone. I transport them in a protected backpack pocket, but the clips manage to work themselves off on their own every few days. They snap back on, so it's more of an annoyance than anything else. Despite these few inconveniences, I would definitely recommend this product."
5,Amazing sound for the price,"In terms of value, I doubt there is a better set of portable headphones anywhere. The sound on these is remarkable. Bass sound full, but not overpowering (a huge issue I have with Monster Beats). Everything sounds really balanced. To get headphones that sound like these, you'd probably have to pay at least $60. These come at 1/3 of the price. Hard to beat that. The only detractor of these headphones is that the clip that keeps it on your ears doesn't really contour with the shape of your ear, and so while these stay on just fine if I'm just sitting around, I doubt these would be adequate for wearing while exercising.Basically, if you're short on cash but don't want to compromise sound, these are a no brainer."
2,VERY UNCOMFORTABLE,These headphones are supposed to clip around your ears but they are terrible to put on. The sound quality seems pretty good but I bought these for jogging and they just are not going to work out for that. I would not recommend for ANY sports. Also the connector looks very cheap and probably wont last long. All in all I was disappointed but they do sound OK for now.
5,"Best price, best product.!!","I ordered 4 headphones. All under $20.00 dollars. The first three, were junk.This one is great. Great price, great sound, ( with great base also) andit feels comfortable on. I also have a pair for $50.00, this one is stillbetter. Thanks AMAZON !!!"
4,Surprising,"I have no expertise in judging sound, but these earphones satisfy my amateur needs in listening to opera. Surprisingly, they provide considerable shielding from ambient sound without the bulk of other earphones specifically so designed. This is a quality especially welcome for use on New York City street strolls."
4,Excellent alternative to ear buds,"I have a problem using ear buds and haven't found a pair that I can wear comfortably, so I started looking for alternatives. I wanted something unobtrusive, and I didn't want an annoying band going across the top of my head so typical headphones were out. I tried the ""sporty"" style of headphones, but with my long, rather thick hair, I was always getting the neckband caught when I had to take them off. Then I found these over the ear headphones. They are quite comfy, they slide right on and off, they don't get caught in my hair, and the sound is awesome. Now I can sit at my pc all day and listen to my tunes comfortably while I work; my ears are very happy. Who says you have to spend a lot of money to get something that works this well!!"
3,Broke within 1 week,"Read product reviews and decided how could I go wrong for $15. Item arrived and they worked for about 1 week until the left earpiece started skipping out, then finally went out altogether. Koss has a lifetime warranty, so other than having to pay the additional shipping, I guess I'll go for another set. I have to admit they sounded pretty good for the price until the one side quit."
2,Eh..,"The sound quality is potentially good but there is too much sound leakage. If you pump them to full volume, they are basically small computer speakers!Not very comfy to wear either."
1,Horrible,"I wanted a pair of headphones that would clip or slip over my ear and hold in place while exercising. These are horrible. They just sit on top of your ear, and gravity keeps them in place. As soon as you take a step or tilt your head, they fall off. Furthermore, the piece that attaches the ear loop to the sound piece is on a pivot, so the ear loop constantly pops out. Very frustrating if they're in your pocket, gym bag, or purse. I've worn them three times and am planning to toss them--- a total waste of money."
1,Please Price These Back Where They Belong,"I added these to my shopping cart recently, but didn't have time that day to finish shopping and check out.I came back the next day and found that the price had risen from $14.09 to $15.71. I've been waiting for it to drop back down, and now it's gone up to $15.78.This is so irritating!"
3,Not durable,"The plastic connection for the ear clip on the outside of the headphones is flimsy. Within two weeks of buying these headphones the ear clip popped off. Now I have to pop it back in whenever I use them & hope I can keep them on.They are comfortable, if you can keep them on."
2,Sound good but flimsy,"These sounded great with my portable player. The ear pieces were hard to deal with while wearing glasses. Also, I was told that everybody within ten feet can hear what I'm listening to at high volume. Not good on public transport.While listening in bed, the plastic ear piece pops off if I roll over wrong. Then I'm fumbling around in the dark trying to reassemble the headphones, while half asleep. Finally one of the ear pieces disappeared, rendering the phones unusable.OK, I'm a klutz. I need something simple, that stays in one piece."
2,Already broken...,"Within two weeks of purchase, the clip on one headphone snapped off in my bag. I managed to snap it back on, but it kept snapping off repeatedly. It now snapped off somewhere between my residence and the train, so I've got one headphone that actually clips to my ear and another that I need to press against my head with my hand. *Sigh*. Time to get another set of earphones."
3,So glad I bought them,"I work on a computer watching and listening to commercials all day. What I hear is very important and the sound quality on these is way better than that of the ones issued by the company. I need to wear them all day and really had a problem with the company supplied pair that had ""earbuds"", I believe they're called, the kind that stick into your ear. They were not only uncomfortable while wearing them but for hours after,that is really the reason I bought the Koss. The fact that they sound better is just gravy."
2,Fussy,"I cannot seem to get these to stay snugly on my ears - it's very fussy to get them on and they feel like they could pop off at any moment. The sound is fine, but it's a little hard to judge since the headphone is barely sitting next to my ear. I'm wishing I'd stayed with the old style head band with a bridge from one ear to the other."
3,Did not live up to the hype,"Well I was looking for some decent sounding headphones with a low price and that is what I got.BUTfrom the way others reviewed these, i was expecting a bit more. The sound quality is just OK, nothing great and nothing bad."
2,Detaching earclips are VERY aggravating,"For some reason the earclips detach from the speakers--I have no idea why they made them that way. They pop off any time the headphones brush up against something. So half the time I'd go to put the headphones on, one of the earclips would be missing, making the headphones totally unusable. I found myself constantly digging around in the bottom of my bag or my desk drawer or searching the floor of my car for the missing earclip. It got really old and I'm not using them anymore.Also, the clips don't fit very well--they're huge. I not a small person and don't have small ears, but they would fall off pretty routinely.Sound quality was fine, though."
2,Returning these immediately,"I can't wear ear buds and have been on the search for clip ons for a long time. Based on many positive reviews, I gave these a try. The clips were uncomfortable and didn't close over my ear at all...I've used other clip phones and they've all closed properly. They sounded pretty good though, and I'm annoyed that they didn't fit well! I may have gotten a defective pair so I hope others have better luck."
3,"Very nice, but didn't last","I hate in-ear phones, so I figured that these would be a nice alternative to listen to music on when working out. I really enjoyed them and thought the sound quality was fairly decent, but after only a month of use, a wire in one of the phones came loose. There doesn't seem to be anything much better than this for the price, however, so I may purchase another one in the future and just hope that the first time was a fluke."
2,Am I missing something???,"Ok, so the price is great. They sound great. Perhaps I'm doing something wrong - but these things will not stay put. I wound up bending the ""adjustable"" ear piece around so they'd fit. However, once I took them off, they were a pain in the a&& to get back on again. Maybe it's just me. I was going to return them, but my husband is going to keep them for work. Good luck to him."
4,Awesome headphones,"The sound quality of these headphones is great, to say the least, for only $20. They sit on your ears pretty comfortably and aren't too heavy. The clips sometimes detach when a little bit too much force is applied, but they just snap right back on. Only downside is that if you're blasting music then everyone around you will definitely hear it, but that comes with the over-ear style. Otherwise, the sound quality is phenominal in comparison to others in its price range and I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
4,Bought for parts,"I use a Chatterbox when riding my motorcycle, but the speakers that came with the Chatter box are absolute junk. I bought these to take apart solder in place of the chatterbox speakers. They have decent sound and have really made an improvement over what I had in my helmet before. Can't say anything about comfort since I ripped them apart right away, but decent sound quality."
1,Broke after one jogging session,"These apparently amazing ear clip headphones broke after one jog, the plastic clip on the side broke off. Get thePhilips Adjustable Earclip Headphones SHS4700/28 (Black)instead."
2,broke almost immediately,"Okay sound (good sound for the price) and a little difficult to put on initially, but one of the ear connectors broke almost immediately."
3,Great Headphones... Until they broke,"These headphones are really great in terms of audio quality. My only issue at the time was, that they were a bit clumsy in the manner they 'clip' to your ears and could be mildy uncomfortable.However, after only two months of use one of the speakers stopped working.I may give these headphones a second try if the manufacturer or amazon give me refund or replacement, after which I will re-review it. Perhaps I was just unlucky."
3,"Do the job, but not so comfortable","These sound fine, not any better than the cheaper Philips pair I had before, but they serve their purpose. My major complaints are that they don't fit well on my ears, and they have this ugly metal bar that sticks out when you wear them. They always feel like they will off because the bottom part of the ear piece is too wide and my earlobes are attached, so it doesn't fit snugly. And it's not clear from the pictures that the top wire part sticks out in a square shape from your head.Overall, they work fine but I wouldn't purchase them again simply because they aren't too comfortable."
4,"Good sound, great price","I am particularly hard on my headphones, so I need to buy a new pair every 6 months. I wanted something that was cheap, but would provide a full sound. These are the best minimalist over-ear headphones I have purchased so far. The clips are a little annoying to position on the ear, but once they are on, they stay on, even when running. My only complaint is the cord is bit long for my taste; it gets caught on stuff as I walk by. Hopefully it won't catch on something and tear the wires out."
3,"Wonderful sound, poor quality control","I bought these for my Sansa Fuze, and the sound quality was unbelievable. Absolutely worth what I paid, unfortunately you do get what you pay for. I bought these mid-April, it's now June 5th and one of my headphones has randomly stopped working.Koss does have a warranty, but for the price of shipping I might as well buy a new pair.These are excellent headphones for their sound quality and comfort, but be wary as the quality control could be a lot better.That aside, I will be buying a new pair. The sound for the price is a good deal. Hoping this next pair work and stay working for longer than two months."
4,Very good. Would recommend.,"Very nice headphones. Great quality sound. This isn't for those who just want bass booming in their ear, this is for those who want the full, wide range of music and all the sounds within it.Only gripe is that if worn for extended periods of time, they can become uncomfortable and begin to hurt your ears a little bit. This has only happened once so far though. Normally there are not many chances to wear them for so long."
1,Earclip Issues,"I ended up returning the headphones in less than a month because the earclips regularly came off. While it is possible to pop the earclips back on, it's frustrating to be stopping every five minutes during a run to make the adjustment. I also found the headphones to be an uncomfortable fit -- perhaps I have unusually shaped ears. The sound quality was great."
2,Handy but Fragile,"I purchased these headphones to use with my ipod for when I didn't want to use my other pair which are in the ear. I thought that with these, I could hear outside sounds and conversations, horns, cell phones, etc. For that purpose, they are great, but they are very fragile and the ear bud pops off of the ear clip fairly easily. The inexpensive plastic construction, though light weight, looks and feels cheap. On the plus side, they sound really good; just don't plan on these for every day wear...they won't hold up."
4,Good sounding headphones that DON'T LAST!,"I purchased these headphones on June 9th, 2010 and already one side of them has completely quit working. I should know better by now seeing as these are the 3rd pair I've had over the years, neither of the 2 pairs I had before ever gave out in 2 months though. This will definitely be the last pair I'll ever actually purchase. I don't know if everyone knows that these have a lifetime warranty on them through Koss and if you go to their website you can find the address where you can return these to for a free replacement pair. I've done that with a previous pair but was to lazy and didn't really feel like returning them to Koss, so I just gave Koss more of my money by purchasing another pair and encouraging them to keep making these headphones with such poor quality build wise. As I mentioned before the pair I purchased in June will be the last pair of these I ever purchase, even though I enjoy the sound quality and fit."
1,Poor quality,"The sound quality was OK, but oe side of the headphone broke in two months. The quality is way below my expectation."
2,Cheaply made,"These headphones are VERY CHEAP! The sport clip pieces fall off from the ear cushions almost every time I put them on. Luckily I was able to find the detached piece and snap it back on, but I wish they were higher quality so this wouldn't happen so often."
1,These clip earphones STINK!,These I thought were going to be the best quality because of the Koss name.How WRONG I was! I bought two sets. It said adjustiable clips. I TRIED toadjust them and the first set broke! I tried the second set and theSAME thing Happened! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT IT ISN'T WORTH ANYTHING!Buyer Beware!!!IT'S CRAP!!!CHEAPLY MADE!Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones
2,eh...falls apart and too loud on subway,"I don't why these got such great reviews. I researched online before I bought them from amazon. The sound quality is alright. The ear pieces are constantly breaking off but are easily snapped back in. Unlike my last pair these are always falling off my head. Also they are very loud and everyone can hear what you're listening to. I bought these for my commute on public transportation but they annoy everyone around me because they're so loud. I try to keep the voulme down. I'm stuck with them until one of the ear pieces breaks for good. Won't be long, I think. The last ones I had were better but I can't find them anywhere. Oh well..."
2,Not very well made,"I was disappointed in how these fit, and that they really aren't adjustable. Some reviewers said something about bending the metal. Well, I guess you could do that, but I had a pair of sports ear phones prior to this (for years before they broke), and the clip part was actually adjustable without having to literally bend the metal. The Koss ad says something about the pivoting ear piece, They don't pivot at all. Anyway, they do not feel at all secure. Most people are not 100% symmetrical, so I'd like to adjust the left one tighter but I can't. The clip part of the headphone pops off when I have them in the pocket of my gym bag. I can just snap it back on, but that is also another thing I find inconvenient. The sound is not great either. I had a pair of Philips sports headphones prior to this, and the sound was much better. So I'm going to purchase another pair of Philips. The cost of shipping and the hassle isn't worth it for me to return these."
3,Just okay,"Simple review:I don't like how they have 2 cords coming from the split. I have another pair (Sony MDR-Q22LP w.Ear Headphones with Interchangeable Headphone Caps)that I'm replacing because I gave them to a friend and the sony's were awesome. The cord had 1 cord going to the left ear and then 1 cord that connected the left to the right headphone. I like that style better.These are really awkward to put on because of the clips. I feel like if I'm not careful I'll snap the clips. Also they fit very snugly over the ear, so when I take them off my ears are bright red!I like to have headphones that can be easily put on and taken off; yet, once I put these on I find myself having to commit to wearing them for sometime.Other than that, they cover the whole ear, so sound quality is nice. Haven't used them for anything intense yet."
5,Love these things,"They slip on easy, the audio quality is great, and they're very portable. I would recommend this to anyone, even if they don't plan on jogging or doing other vigorous activity."
3,Fine but not wonderful,"I was trying to decide between several headphones when I made this purchase. I had had a similar pair, Sony brand, previously and I loved them, but couldn't find the same ones online this time. So I decided to try something new. These are ok. They don't hurt my ears to wear for long periods and they don't fall off which were my main criteria. But... they sit so far away from my ears because the frame is rigid. I end up turning the volume up louder than usual to get the same amount of sound into my ears. And I know at the gym people exercising near me can probably hear my music too. I wasn't looking for noise canceling earphones or the likes, but these are just a little too loose. I'll use them until they break or die, but I won't be buying this product again."
2,Good headphones but delicate. They only lasted 6 months,These work well and hook on the ears securely. But they snap off easily and broke after only 5 months. I'm disappointed.
3,Suited for someone sitting,"The hinges that actually hold the earphones on your ears barely open-they are comfortable, but there's never any sense of the earphones feeling like they're doing anything more than dangling from your ears. Might not sound like that big of deal, but wear these on a treadmill or laying around watching videos and you'll know what I mean (probably suited to wearing while sitting at a desk listening to music). The sound quality is good, but again, not the quality I would expect from Koss, a company that has specialized in such technology for decades.Update: I accidently smacked them on a table (lifting my tablet up and they were connected) and the left speaker went out completely. Piece of junk."
5,good price,very good sound when look at the price $26 including shipping fee. I had bought a phone of $25 in Australia and that phone has no way to compare with this.
4,my 2nd set,This is my 2nd set for these ear phones. The 1st set lasted well over a year before they started to cut in and out. With that said these are the best ear phones I have ever had when it comes to good sound and great comfort.I like the way you can still hear a conversation when while listening to music or watching a movie. At this low price I don't mind buying a new set every year or so
5,A must buy product,"I bought them for under my helmet and they sound great. Took a few hours to break them in as some people claimed to hear some distortion in them. I noticed this early on but the more I listen to them the better they sound. They are plenty loud but do not block out all the outside noise. With a lifetime warranty I'd love to say I would buy them again, but I may not need to.... I will review these again in a few months in an update."
4,Cant miss,"I did my homework prior to choosing the Koss KSC75's. Based on the high recommendation and price, they seemed to be the best choice. They are. The crisp and clear sound were better than expected and the rediculously low cost make these a can't miss. The ear clips take a little getting use to but they fit comfortably. The only downer is the ear clips occasionally tangle with the cord when being put away after use. Need to take care not to wrap the cord close to the clips. In summary, the Koss KSC75's are the best you can get for the price. You will not be disappointed."
3,"Passable sound, Poor Construction of ear holder - not durable","I've owned 2 sets of these.They always break on the holder, which barely stays attached to the headphone anyway.There may be a modification online that can remedy this, but straight from the package it is a serious defect that the ear hook will not stay attached to the phones.Eventually got something else. Too bad, these sound pretty good for what they are.I have also owned the Sennheiser PX 100-II On Ear Miniheadphone (Black) and enjoyed them. I believe the Sennheiser have far better sound, though less portability. The durability of the PX 100 is definitely better as well."
5,Nice Headphones - not BUDS!,I read several reviews of this headphone saying it's not good on the bass! Ireally enjoyed the extra bass when I got these head phones compared to some others I had before. I had panasonic - no comparison - these are great.. I had a feeling that the KOSS would sound terrific - they do. I love all the extra sounds I get. Love these. A great headset for a small price. Go for it and see for yourself. Wow for the price.
3,Ok for the price,"I wanted some over the ear headphone that weren't too expensive to use when I didn't like my earbuds. These headphones were recommended by my husband who uses them everyday and loves them. The sound quality was good, but these weren't secure on my ears, even after adjusting them several times. I think they're probably great for people with ears larger than mine, but I haven't been the biggest fan. Overall, they are a good deal for the price point, but I have been using my earbuds most of the time instead of these."
5,Excellent headphones for the price.,"I've owned a pair for about three years now, and they're still going strong. Excellent sound quality and comfort for the price. These aren't isolating headphones, so noise does leak out, but the sound quality is way better than any closed headphones that you can find for this price."
3,Good Be Better,"Sound is decent, especially for the money. Hate the cords though, they get tangled up so easily. I was going to use these for exercise but I found they will not stay on the ears."
5,Goldilocks is Fully Satisfied...,"Head/behind the ear phones are too non-portable. Earbuds are too uncomfortable and don't stay in my ears. But these are JUST RIGHT!Noise cancelling headphones are too expensive. Most cheap department earphones have bad sound. But these are JUST RIGHT!For the folks who thought the sound was bad, I hope I'm not insulting you, but did you adjust your equilizer? I had to make major adjustments and these earphones did NOT sound good with my MP3 player's factory default equilizer settings."
3,2.5/5,Pros: Good sound qualityCons: Headphone cord is fairly short & the headphones are uncomfortable if worn for too long
4,Best running headphones to date,"Pro's: Snug fitGood soundCheapCon's: Questionable quality This is my second pair. My original pair suffered from a mildly traumatic pull while I had them on. Thereafter the headphones where too loose and in short time one of the headphones gave up.I would have rated these three stars due to their short life (5months), but as I have yet to find a pair of headphones that last longer than a year it gets an adjustment."
5,Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones,As many reviewers have pointed out...for the money the are AWESOME.
5,Legendary headphone value doesn't disappoint,"Others have hailed these headphones' ""bang for buck"" value, and they are not wrong. Inexplicably, 90% of the headphones on amazon.com seem to have 4-star ratings (which can make it difficult to choose, and is hard to understand as the lions' share of consumer-grade headphones are *terrible*), but these are actually the real deal. These literally famous headphones are unquestionably the best sounding thing you can buy for this money. In truth, they are not *quite* as good as the KSC-35s they replaced (which had a bit more bass and were slightly more expensive), but KSC-75s really sound *incredibly* good for the money. Seriously.You can pick the looks apart or the clip mechanism if this type of headphone isn't your cup of tea--but if you're evaluating raw sound it's *amazing* how good these sound for the price. So for what these cost, stop shopping and just buy these right now.KSC-75 is the budget headphone king."
2,This item is for BIG ears,"I bought this item because my ears are small and there are no comfortable earbuds that fit me. I've had other over-the-ear headphones in the past and loved them (they discontinued the type I like). These Koss headphones are designed for people with really big ear lobes. These earphones are bulky and barely balance on my ears. My other complaint is that the ear clip piece keeps falling out of its attachement to the foam sound piece. One good thing about this item is the quality sound. If you have really big earlobes, this would be a fine product for you. Otherwise look around for something else."
2,Don't last...,"I've owned three pairs of these headphones, and I've arrived at the same conclusion with each. They sound great, but definitely do not last.I've found that one side gives out and I'm left with sound in one ear; usually the left. I use them casually with my iPod, and rarely find that they are being tugged. Yet, I suspect the cords are not properly glued into place, and the side tends to detatch enough for sound to stop.I kept purchasing newer pairs, because I love the over-the-ear style, and these do have excellent sound quality. But I've stocked up, as I'm on my third set. As soon as I find a better brand, I'm going to toss these out the window. Good thing they're down to around $14, because they're certainly not worth more."
4,"Great product, just not for me","These headphones sounded very clear and crisp. I listen to all kinds of music from reggae to baroque, and they sounded pretty good with whatever I threw at them. I must say though, I thought they were a bit lacking in bass response. As a user of in-ear or ""canal"" phones, I am used to stronger bass. This is turn led me to try and find ways to make them fit tighter over the ear (and also get more isolation). I tried using a headband, and it worked ok, but felt weird having to do that. I also tried forcing my ears through the clips to keep the drivers as close to the ear as possible but this led to some pain after prolonged listening.So, basically for someone who wants an open-air style set of phones, these are great. I still rate 4 stars because they are very good at what they are designed to do. It just wasn't the type of phones I was looking for."
4,Good set of headphones,"The headphones play pretty good sound. The ear pieces are easy to twist and adjust. The cable is prone to tangling which is why this gets four stars instead of five. Most of the time, I don't feel like I am wearing these. Pretty good value for money."
3,Excellent sound but impossible to wear,"I wrote a 5 star review when these arrived and I listened to them. For the price, the sound quality is excellent. However, I struggled to get the these things on my ear. I assumed with practice I'd become more proficient. Not so. It is an exaspirating struggle to put these on every time. Once on, they are not particularly comfortable, but it is the struggle to get them on which irks me no end. I re-visited the reviews after some time and gave a 1 star review. What good are these if you cannot wear them? Finally I returned to give a 3 star review. My ears are on the large side. Possibly if you have small ears you'll find these less troublesome."
3,Sound great but hurt my ears,"I've been using them for around 6 months now fairly regularly. They sound good but in about 30 minutes, the clips start hurting my ears. I've tries wearing them many different ways... twisting them in place, letting them just snap on and sit there etc but same results."
4,Great for the price...but let's not get carried away...,"On paper the frequency response is almost exactly like the IGrado's, but there IS a pronounced difference. These are brighter and more delicate. I would describe the sound as slightly hollow. There's something missing. I lost my Yuin PK2's and when I went to replace them, I wanted to buy an American product. After using these, I really miss the Yuins...but..are they worth $60.00 more?? I think they might be. If all you want to spend is about $20.00, I'm pretty sure these phone are the best you're gonna find."
5,Ugly as sin....,"...but the sound on these headphones are amazing. I've owned them for around a year now, and the sound is still addictive each time I put them on. I consider myself a bit of an audiophile, and I own Grados and many, many other headphones...but these are definitely the most fun sounding of them all. Admittedly, they are really ugly and they leak a lot of sound, so I wouldn't advise using them on your daily commute. But, for running outside and private use, they are perfect. For under $20, you really can't go wrong - these headphones are an incredible bargain. If my pair broke today, I'd buy another in a heartbeat. I should also note that I'd easily pay $200 to have headphones like these that were closed and looked good.I should note, they were pretty uncomfortable the first time I put them on, but I don't really notice them on my ear anymore."
3,Maybe my Ears are Funny.,"This headset is cheap, and that's something I like, but it's a quality headset as far as sound goes. The bass is surprisingly deep for such a inexpensive set, much better than my more expensive Grado headset. My biggest problem, and the reason for my low rating was because of the fit. I can't find a convenient way of putting these things on in a position that does not feel like they are going to fall off or are squeezing my ears. Maybe my ears are too big, or too thick, I really can't say, but whatever the case, I have not been able to wear them comfortably and listen to music. If you can fit your ears in it (it's more ""slip-on"" than ""clip-on""), I think you'll like."
2,Low quality construction,"The fit and sound quality of these is quite acceptable considering the price, and I was happy to have an alternative to buds to give my ears a break. They fit snugly enough to stay on and do not bother my ears. I wear them at work while sitting and ocasionally walking somewhere in the building and not while exercising, so I cannot speak to how well they stay on while active. I have had them less than a month, however, and the left speaker has started cutting out, forcing me to fidget with the cord to make it work. This is unacceptable after so short a time. This is my first and may be my last Koss purchase. These are supposed to have a limited lifetime warrantee so I will update after I look into it."
4,Good cheap headphones,"If you read other reviews you'll see that while these headphones are cheap, and have good sound; the ear pieces are awkward and sometimes pop off. They are not meant for everyone's ears, but if you struggle with ear buds but don't want full ear covering, then you can do worse than these."
4,Undoubtedly the best headphones under $20,"For the price, I have heard the sound quality is the best there is, and though I haven't thoroughly tested that claim I can say they sound pretty fun, with good detail and solid bass. Comfort-wise they aren't the greatest, but I can wear them for an hour or so without fatigue. Most importantly though, these things are light and hold onto your ear like a clamp, combine that with the lack of noise isolation and you have an ideal workout companion."
3,Warranty works,"I ordered these headphones because of the mostly positive reviews. About a month the right side stopped working. I contacted the manufacture and they told me to ship it to them and they'll either repair or replace. They were going to charge me $9 for shipping and handeling, but I told them I just bought it so they waved the $9. I shipped it out and received new ones today. They weren't the same ones I bought, but I actually like them better than the onese I bought. They sent me the Koss Clipper."
2,"Great Sound, but not loud. Right-side headphone speaker sound went out after just 2 days.","Great Sound, but not loud. Right-side headphone speaker sound went out after just 2 days. Was very hard to get on my ear correctly. Even after some practice. I'm going to try Sony and Panasonic next. I returned these to Amazon defective."
3,"Sound is fine for cheap, but...","These are good for the price, but I find myself using my Senheiser 100's because the over the ear hook is just not really comfortable. It's not that they're painful, they are always THERE, letting you know you have something over your ear. I wear glasses, so there is something different about these, I would like to try modding them and wear them over the head, but that's just too much trouble. They stay in the drawer most of the time."
5,Great headphones,"Use these every day and really like them. They don't hurt my ears, even when I lay down and listen to music laying on my side. The sound quality is excellent and the price is right--what more is there to say?"
4,Fantastic Headphones,"I got these to replace the earbuds, because they kept falling out of my ears on the treadmill. I was worried that others would be able to hear my offensive music with over-the-ear headphones, but I don't have that problem with these. The sound quality is great and, best of all, they stay on. They are a little awkward to put on, though."
4,Good stuff,"After using these headphones at work for a few weeks I have to say that I'm very impressed for their cost. Although they are a bit bulkier to carry around than earbuds they are very comfortable and sound nice. The only problem I've had with them is sometimes the ear clips pop off the speakers at the swivel point(usually when they are in my pocket and get bumped) but they are easy to reattach and haven't caused me any real trouble. Overall very good value for the price, if you're looking for this style of headphone then definately give them a try."
4,$8.50 for a toilet paper roll,I am using this to stage a bedroom otherwise I would feel guilty about disguising my toilet paper roll.
5,Fantastic Fun!,"This story is fast paced, excitting, and full of 007 style adventure. Only it a lot more hard edged than the bond series and more violent.If Jack Novak was incharge of the drug war we would have a better chance of winning! The author and his character have a healthy, but seldom heard view point in this age of left wing, political correct, do-gooders who only bring society closer to the brink!"
5,"Great, but $$","This toy is fantastic, but I bought it at Walmart or Target for $25, don't spend $50 for it through Amazon."
4,delightful,"I found the story and subtle yet obvious revelations of the green carnation to be a tantalising glimpse into the subtlety of sexuality in the eighteen hundreds. I recommend it as indolent, decadent and a complete delight for any one interested in an insight into the lives of Oscar Wilde and Alfred Douglas."
5,Splendid parody of Wilde and Douglas,"It is unfortunate that the fun of this book was spoiled by the tragedy that followed in the lives of Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas, causing the author to withdraw the book. I feel that Neil McKenna in his biography of Wilde goes too far in blaming Hichens for Wilde's downfall and for portraying Hichens as self-loathing. This book is an hilarious satire on Wilde and Douglas, full of insider knowledge based on the author's friendship with them. He catches the tone and lilt of Wilde's style to perfection."
3,Overkill,"As a satire on the spirit of Oscar Wilde, ""The Green Carnation"" is definite overkill. Hichens' own epigrammatism lacks the grace and subtlety of Wilde's wit and wisdom, and he drags wall-to-wall his assays into cleverness whether or not they are appropriate to develpment of the context. Disappointing."
2,Poor Transcription,"There seems to be problems with transcribing some parts of books such as this. Throughout, the major turning points of the stories, which are quotes from either letters or newspaper articles, are completely missing. I am guessing that the missing sections appear in italics or some variant form.This not the only book in which I have seen this -- makes the entire thing useless. A Mark Twain book was made undecodable."
4,Great book!!!!,"I loved this book and was very sad when I finished it. I will be reading more books by these authors, I can tell you that for sure."
5,dont know if right one,"Please let ne know , what other songs are on there because l am looking for a song by this artist and you dont mention song list THANKS"
4,"Gong - 'Live On TV,1990' (Code 90)","Just when you think to the very best of your knowledge, you might have nearly all the legit Gong releases,up pops another title that you never even knew existed. Think I may've have seen this title in a Border's Books & Music store before, but I can't be sure. This eleven track CD was lifted off a UK television show, called Bedrock. Almost as good as their '25th Birthday Party' 2-CD (see my review). Tracks here that make for great listening pleasure are ""I've Been Stoned Before"", ""Pot Head Pixies"", the out-there ""Inner Vision"", one of my personal favorites ""I Am Your Animal"" (isn't that on the first Gong album?), ""Flying Teacup"" and ""I Am You"". Line-up: Daevid Allen - guitar&vocals, Gilli Smyth - space whisper & vocals, Steffy Sharpstrings - guitar, Didier Malherbe-sax&flute and Twink (Pink Fairies and early Pretty Things member)- synth&keyboards. Didn't see a drummer listed. Worthwhile cosmic rock title to seek out a copy of."
4,I am also among those elated to finally be able to purchase 2nd season,My question is now that we finally get season 2 on DVD. What is to be the case for the remaining 3 seasons?
1,Taking way too long to get the item delivered!,I am still waiting for my DVD of Soul Food 3rd Season. I should have trusted my instincts and ordered directly from Amazon not a seperate seller. The first seller I bought my season 2 from was great and timely! I even paid extra for expedited shipping and it still isn't here! I have been waiting well over a week and a half now and the expected maximum delivery was August 29th. This sucks!
5,Excellent!,This season of Soul Food offers more episodes filled with drama and love. Let's not forget BORIS KODJOE I'm happy that I made this purchase! Can't wait until the next season to be released.
5,The BOMB!!!!!,"I was so excited to find out the release of the Second Season of Soul Food. I already have saeson one, so I had to purchase Season Two, which I happen to watch in three days upon arrival. I cant wait for the rest to be released. Soul Food was the only show that displayed a positive image of Black Folks, as well as the TRUE LOVE that is expressed within the Black Family. I love the show and wish it was still on the air.I miss you Lil J, Bird, Terri, Max, Ahmad, Brook, Kelly, Lem, Terri, Damon, Kenny and Auntie Ruthie.A True Soul Food FAN!!!!!!"
5,Great work Marc!,This story weaves a tapestry of characters that are as colorful as the universe they are portrayed in!
2,You get what you pay for.,"These cases look nice, but they don't have the slipperiness of higher quality satin cases, even fresh out of the package."
2,Disappointment,"I was disappointed with the book because it contained no pictures for the small children to look at when being read the book.I also expected a paper folder cover to protect the book.The book hard cover is plain, drab and grey in colour. Not very exciting for a young child.Overall very disappointed"
4,A Book Within a Book,"This is another mystery by the wonderfully literate Stephen Greenleaf. It is a mystery about a manuscript that turns up on a publisher's desk. Is it fiction or truth. Its a ""book case"". Get it?The manuscript is about a teacher at a prestigious Bay area prep school who is framed. He is accused of molesting a student and spends several years in jail. He is innocent and the book manuscript tells of the particulars of his frame-up and how he will take revenge. Tanner is hired to find the author of the manuscript and discover whether the manuscript is truth or fiction.This is a book within a book. It is very clever and a fun page-turner as are all Greenleaf mysteries."
3,Peep's new friends,My 2 year old granddaughter loves the Peep videos so I got her 3 of them for Christmas assuming any of them would be great. Apparently there is a scarecrow in this video that is too scary and she won't watch it. Maybe when she's older....
4,Better than most Gipsy Kings albums,"If you're like me, and you craved more Gipsy Kings after hearing their eponymous album, only to find that most of their other albums pale in comparison, you'll be pleased by the first cuts on the Gipsy Reign disc.Just listen to the first 3 samples to see if you agree. I don't believe that their style is any more derivative than the Gipsy King's style, since both trace their style to a wider genre, and more specifically, to the same grandfather. I suppose Elvis Presley was derivative of Carl Perkins, but that didn't mean he wasn't fun to listen to.All of the tracks don't hold up equally, but when they, hit the mark, they knock it to the next room. Enjoy!"
3,beauty fades against more beautiful things,"You know, i would have loved this cd if this was the first cd i heard of them. But ""Le bout du toit"" and ""chamboultou"" are better. They are ones you chould buy!"
2,It's okay...,"Alright, first off this piece of crap will randomly stop playing. It started off when I'd just walk around that it would turn off, but now sometimes I barely TOUCH IT and tilt it to the side to look at the song and it turns off. It is NOT easy to use if you're a HOLD button person... if you have it on hold while plugged into your computer, it will not let you delete or add music, which made me panick at first and fear for a permanant playlist.Also, the headphones that come with it are REALLY not worth it, they are really really bad, so go buy some nice Sony ones.AND, the song switcher thinger is a little defective... it's neat, but you can push it down and it'll hit something inside of the MP3 player that makes the songs skip and be all crazy... so it gives me a fear of damaging the insides of my MP3 player whenever its in my pocket or something.I think thats about it... I wouldn't recommend it, unless you want a cheap piece of s***."
3,Okay if it worked longer,I purchased this mp3 player Sunday and it's Tuesday and it's no longer working--I tried new batteries and everything so tomorrow I'm taking it back for another one to see if it will work--When it was working though it did play good--Well hope to have better luck on the next one....
3,"Ok, but not recommended","For about 12-15 bucks the player is ok, but if you are serious about your music and like to have hundreds of songs this is not for you. It's ok for short trips like bus rides and what not because it can't hold many songs. And there are no playlists.Also, it doesn't take long to get use to how it works, but I had some problems with changing the songs. Syncing music is easy, and the sound quality is average. It isn't that bad but it isn't that good either.But sense it's cheap you can't really expect much."
3,It's OK.,"Three and a half stars would be more of an accurate appraisal. Not the best chess book I've read, but some good tactical themes. While studying this book for about month, I still couldn't figure out the best way to utilize the information other than take it for granted that when Larry Evans states ""not to leave your King vulnerable""...not to leave your King vulnerable. The author's annotation is not very thorough, there was not enough detail explaining the why's behind the moves other than the simple good and bad moves. It is an ok book, but not a necessity to one's library. Why buy a book that's just ok when you have a choice of books that are much much better and at the same time, the same price?"
1,Superficial and inaccurate,"Larry Evans' standing as a chess author has gone down sharply over the years and this book helps show why. It is insubstantial and has many silly errors (name spellings, wrong moves etc.). Not that Evans is alone in such superficiality. One of the greatest mysteries of chess is why such a cerebral game has been the subject of so many potboilers. Cardoza, the publisher of this book, specialises in them, unfortunately."
2,"Pretty, but way too painful",I'm usually ok with most of the pain that comes with heels. This bends the foot to an awkward form. The hole in the middle just cuts into my foot. It's pretty though...!!!
3,Tastes like plain whipped butter,"I was expecting a milkier, richer taste but this tastes just like plain whipped butter or even just plain butter, but less salty. When the bottle arrived, the cream contents looked strange because the cream had a marbling color of neon yellow and white; not a uniform white, milk color shown in the picture advertised. The cream settled to the bottom of the jar and also looked lumpy. I might have received a bad jar, or the contents might have chemically altered due to heat in transit, I don't know, but the cream was not at all what I expected. It did not taste like the clotted cream I ate when I was in England and did not have a smooth texture."
3,Good for hangin out,"This sneaker is great for hanging around, but not good for walking. Looks good, comfortable for the short haul, but uncomfortable if you are doing any real amount of walking."
5,"Duncan Chisholm ""Redpoint""","This is an excellent recording. We have been fans of Aly Bain for a long time but there never seems to be enough of his music so we went a hunting on Amazon and we found this. Great recording with a wide range of Irish fiddle music. We are fans of music with a lot of feeling especially the cuts such as 'Leaving Stoer', 'Moonlight on Loch Ness' and 'The Congress Set'.If you like Aly Bain you'll like this for sure"
1,poor sales tactic,"The add for this ""SINGLE"" I repeat ""SINGLE"" tap socket is deceiving to say the least in the sellers add they picture a complete set of socket taps they should show the item by itself as to not confuse the customer. I'm heartily displeased with this sellers item display.Buyer beware!!!"
1,This is a bad movie,"This is quite possibly the most overated film of all time. It is not a good movie. Keeping in mind the time in which it was made, it is still bad compared to other movies of the time. The acting is bad, it doesn't even come close to following the book (but then again, what Dracula movie does?), and the camera work is extremely shoddy. The only plus of this movie is that there is a pretty gloom and creepy atmosphere to it. But the fact that this version is so highly touted and the Coppola's version, although far from perfect, is so bashed is a testament to how bad film critics are at thier job. Very dissapointing movie."
1,terrible not scary,I guess when this movie was made they were scared realy easy my favorite realy old horror movie would be phantom of the opera my favorite horror movie ever is the shining
1,Older is better.,I have the older version of this wonderful old horror classic and it it truly great. For some reason the version here has been scored with the modern Phillip Gloss. The modern score is scarier than Bela Lugosi. In fact the modern drumming music is often so loud that the actors can not be heard. How could they ruin this fine old flic? This is very sad indeed!
5,"Dracula, with Bela Lugosi","This is the original Dracula film, at least with sound. The semi-scary moments are there, but in good taste -- and far better than that string of similar plot movies that have been churned out ever since, with nothing but sickening scenes all the way though. In the old days, we viewers were called on to exercise our imagination, not just sit and watch garbage. I never cease to find that preferable to the eye."
4,Dracula---the music video!,"This is a great movie, of course. But if you are looking for the ""original"" version, this is not it. The new music adds a lot, but at times I felt as if I was watching a music video or something. In some ways it was really neat, but overall the music took away from the original creepiness.!"
2,Did not like it.,"I collect vampire movies and books, which is why I bought this movie. I found it flat. It is not well enough done to be horror nor slappy enough to be good slapstick. The only engaging characters are the Carpathians and Reinfield, the rest are flat and boring."
1,Universal Studios...What Were You Thinking!,"There was never a need for ""New Coke"" and the same goes for ""New Dracula"".This film although a bit stagey, is a classic. Lugosi is Dracula, the film's gothic legend and immortal star. Unfortunately someone at Universal forgot this basic fact and cranked up the new music so loudly it distracts you from the dialogue. What is the point of watching The Great Lugosi and Dwight Frye if you cannot hear them!Whomever is responsible at Universal for this travesty, I can only wish that you take a coach to Borgo Pass at Midnight.By the way... I am waiting with a stake for your heart!"
5,Dracula,"The Real Original Dracula(as far as movies go) Bela Lugosi, The movie is a Masterpiece,While I prefer Frankenstein and more so Bride of Frankenstein to Dracula,there is no denying the ability of Bela to be the only true Dracula."
5,Truly a classic- Lugosi's finest and most famous work,"When you think Dracula, you think of Bela Lugosi in the trademark cape with the errie yet enticing accent. And when you think Bela Lugosi, you think this movie- duh! Bela Lugosi made this 1931 horror classic a legend- the prince of all horror movies. The film, which begins with a haunting rendition of the Swan Lake theme during the opening credits, is rather slow moving, but the crisp and calm character of Lugosi's Dracula perfects everything. Dwight Frye plays the perfect madman as the Count's looney henchman. Helen Chandler's Mina is innocent and bewildering, while Van Helsing is smart and quick. Overall, a defenite must for any classic horror buff. Something you will want to watch again and again!"
2,Buy The Version Without The Score Instead,"It's a great film, but the new score plays non-stop and is very distracting during the dialogue. I strongly recommend that viewers seek out the original, music-free version."
3,Dracula: Lugosi's Famous Classic,"Dracula (1931) is the best of the Universal classics. The Mummy, Frankenstein and others aren't that great in comparison to this film. Unfortunetly, because of its ancient age (1931), this film is slightly unwatchable because it is so dated. Lugosi is great, and everything is superb- but the age, black and white picture, disortion and quality (even in special editions) tones down its classic stance. Worth buying, but those looking for a not-so-tedious, slightly dated (but entertaining) Lugosi film should get The Devil Bat (1941) which may just be superior to this masterpiece of classic Universal terror."
1,"Beware the version with ""music""","We recently ordered what we thought was the original Dracula movie. We'd had a copy before, but had loaned it out and never got it back. It was an all-time favorite. Well, the one we received contained a new ""musical score"" that is obtrusive, distracting, and poorly, poorly done. It was the biggest disappointment. This was a classic! The music not only is too loud, and inappropriate -- but it obscures the already-muffled dialogue. Old movies often have fuzzy dialogue, owing to the limited technology at the time -- I understand that. But this musical score adds nothing of quality to the picture. I only wish we'd known this when we ordered it..."
2,should have been better,The 75th anniversary edition of this horror classic really disappointed me. While it's true that the picture is crisp and sharper than earlier editions its too bright and the sound is disgraceful the famous monsters edition had much better audio I think universal needs to go back to the drawing board on this one If you have a previous edition dont waste your money on this one!
4,The new score has really improved this old favorite,"Like many of you, I have seen this film many times, both in theaters, t.v. and home video. While the 'original' Dracula was always a favorite of mine, I would never consider it all that great of a movie.The Phil Glass score has given this film new life. It's almost like seeing the movie for the first time."
5,Great stuff for all extra-content junkies,"Universal's done a wonderful job of presenting these three versions of the Dracula story; it hasn't left my dvd player since the mailman came friday afternoon! It's especially interesting to compare the spanish version with Tod Browning's seminal film. I was also curious about the new score Phillip Glass wrote for the Kronos Quartet to perform (I'm a fan of both Glass and Kronos). Some have complained about the mix, and I tend to agree, but found that careful adjustment of my surround sound channels produced a good balance.One quibble - Amazon notes that the DVD features the Glass soundtrack as an isolated audio track, but I can't seem to find the music independent of the dialog. It's unfortunate, but after a couple listens I've decided that although the music complements the film adequately, it really doesn't stand on it's own as an independant, coherent piece (atten: rabid Phillip Glass fans, your mileage will probably vary)."
4,A Classic Horror Movie,"This is the original Dracula. It is great. It has a good story, but not as quit as how the book is. But, mostly, Director and writers do that, so they can show it there way. I think there is nothing wrong with it. It would be nice if it went by the book. But, I give this 4stars instead of 5 because They killed Dracula, but they never kiled Lucy, when she became a vampire, and they never staked Dracula's Brides."
4,The Roots of Modern Vampire Films,"This version of ""Dracula"" is a movie buff's film. For its time it was groundbreaking. Nowadays, it comes across as a little overacted and since it's in black and white a little less than interesting visually. (Or if you're a fan of black and white films I suppose it could be MORE interesting visually, it's all a matter of perspective.) It can still be viewed as the ""where it all began"" as far as how all major films about Dracula would be approached for many years to come. The 1922 silent film ""Nosferatu"" presented the Dracula-like character a great deal differently and did not take hold the way this 1931 interpretation starring Bela Lugosi did. This movie paved the way for the success that the Dracula genre still enjoys to this day. I'd recommend it to anybody who is interested in seeing the ""roots"" of the vampire in the film industry."
5,Renfield,"Guess who's a scarier actor than Bela Lugosi? Dwight Frye. I saw this when I was a little kid and I didn't even notice Mr. Lugosi. For all I cared, they could have cast Chico Marx or Lou Costello in the title role. I'm still having nightmares about the entymophage, his eyes protruding like Peter Lorre's, pleading for mercy in his husky falsetto."
4,Good replacement,"This purchase replaced the previous model from GE that was just like the previous one except for one thing. In the previous model, the microphone boom could be removed. I like that feature since it made it even more portable. However, the reason that I had to replace the older model is that I either was generating static in VOIP conversations or the others on the line could not hear me. So, I suspect this new, permanent mounting was to address such an eventual defect."
3,Not the best choice.,"The adjustability of this night splint is the only reason it's 3 star instead of 2. It does work well, and the angle of the splint is easily adjustable. But the straps are too narrow causing them to dig in. The padding on the straps is also inadequate compounding the problem. After a week or so, I got it adjusted to where it was somewhat comfortable. I am considering some foam or additional padding under the straps to make them more comfortable so I can increase the angle slightly on the brace."
3,Too LARGE,"Sizing chart indicates LARGE size is for a men's size 8-1/2 - 10-1/2 shoe size, but my narrow size 10 foot feels lost inside the night splint. Straps are adjusted to the smallest size possible and it still feels much too large for my foot. Perhaps a MEDIUM might have been better suited for narrow feet.It does help alleviate heel soreness, and I'd recommend use of this or similar devices, but be prepared to try more than one size for proper fit."
1,VANILLA FUDGE LTD,BEFORE ANYONE CAN REVIEW THE CD... WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE TRACK LIST... SEE A COVER PHOTO... FIND OUT THE ORIGIN OF THE CD!
5,Kids love it!!,"This book is really good my grandson is 4 years old and love everything about Thomas and Friends, and this book he just love it and ask to read it again and again.."
4,Nice little reader,"My daughter is continuing her reading skills using these books! They are great. Pretty cute story, too."
4,A very good book that needs updating,"This book has insights about decision making that are found in few other places. The examples, however, could include some newer ones that have happened since the book was written."
5,"The books arrived in perfect condition and in record time, however..","My textbook arrived in perfect condition and in record time. My only complaint is the following:I received an email from Amazon saying my bank declined payment and my order was canceled. I was instructed to edit my bank information and reorder which I did.Then I received an email saying that the order went through.I ended up with two sets of textbooksWhen I sent one order back, I was charged because it ""was my fault"".On the screen where you list reasons for the return, there was nothing that could adequately explain why I was returning the books.Other than that, my experience with Amazon was great."
3,Not all that,"This cd is a recorded interview of madonna during the who's that girl tour....some english guy interviews her on certain topics like her music and her love life....quite outdated considering madonna keeps changing, however its a good glimpse into her career in the early 90's"
2,Poor description,I ordered this item by mistake because the description was so poor. It is not a good value at all. Here is what you get:-ReNu MULTIPLUS SOLUTION - 12 0Z BOTTLE-1 ReNu MULTI-PURPOSE SOLUTION -2 OZ BOTTLE-1 BAUSH & LOMB REWETTING DROPS - 3 mL BOTTLE-2 ReNu LENS CASES-TRAVEL POUCHYou are only getting 14 oz. total of the Renu solution. I am going to return it and order the 2 16 oz. bottles for $28.88. A much better deal.
3,leaks,"Although large enough for a 14 year old, not as absorbent. Most night we experience leaks. To avoid leaks, one would need to double up."
2,"If you want to pass, buy something else","Sybex would be the only book I would suggest if you are taking a Microsoft test, I used them to obtain my MCSE, however for Novell tests they just don't cover enough information to pass the test. This book is way to expensive and I would suggest buying the Novell Press books."
3,Buy the official Novell version,"After trying to take the tests for CNE: Administration and CNE: Advanced Administration, I am of the opinion that this book is not the ideal choice. The exam questions are very picky about language, and you would do better to have official Novell brand material to study from. This book does a decent job of hitting the highlights, but an official Novell student manual would be more helpful and would help the reader avoid having to guess what Novell meant. It's sort of like having a study guide for the King James Bible vs. the NIV Bible and having the exam be on one specific version. This is my opinion after having thoroughly read this book."
4,Great information,This book is great for all in the medical field to understand the facets of medical decision making and how important is the patient's autonomy. This book points out the different factors and discusses them well.
5,The best quick reference of its type that I have read,"Not just a great guide for writers, this book provides an excellent digest of information about the Civil War to include military and civilian life. It accurately and simply portrays the culture and technology of that period. Of special interest are the sections on slang and idiom and entertainment. The book also provides useful information on resources to include interesting web sites and historic sites."
5,Student writing with Everyday Life During the Civil War,"Drama is a great resource for teaching Civil War history. Using Everyday Life during the Civil War a reference guide, students are able to quickly add realistic touches to their plays. While creating a simple play about a son leaving for the war, students are able to check Everyday Life about the dress of persons during this time period, what they ate, how they spoke, how they traveled, how they entertained themselves and many other details of life during the 1860s. A great teaching tool."
3,Useful but limited,"This book contains a great deal of information but often does not put it in context. Thus there are lists of slang terms, available foods, etc. etc. but rather little about mentalities or about how the different spheres of daily life worked together to form a whole. It sometimes comes across as a Trivial Pursuit sort of thing. Nevertheless, it is fairly good and does pretty well at describing soldier life."
5,One of her Best!,"I have read many of the author's books, but I think this one is the best I have read so far. The characters are well written and you can feel your feelings for the characters change throughout the book. The novel ties in the thoughts of all sides and you feel more as though the situations are real, and you are a friend hearing about it first hand. Great chick lit read!"
3,Test in Progress,"Currently testing this model w/ MS Flight Sim '04. Comfort level is good due to adjustable palm rest that accomodates Lefties as well as us normal people. Ha-Ha. Operation has been solid and responsive thus far, Will update in one month. Question about the lead warning label on cable. I don't know the severity or risk level. ????"
4,angry potential buyer,why on earth does this joystick cost so much? I buy one almost every year and at walmart and it costs 19.99. What the hell is wrong with amazon.com
5,Love the product!,Southpaw pilots rejoice! This had everything I needed and if you reverse the throttle axis it completely resolves the complaints of other reviewers saying the throttle gets in the way during operations. Also there is a blue LED light at the top of mine. I see some people saying theirs doesn't have one. The only problem I have with the joystick is because I bought it used. If it were sold in the US I would buy a brand new one right now.It's hard to find a left handed joystick with good functionality that is aesthetically pleasing. This meets all three criteria.
3,Huge!,"This joystick has performed well for me in terms of drivers (downloaded from Saitek website for Windows 7, 64 bit), button and joystick functions. I bought it to play an online flying game because the controls on my gamepad felt too ""twitchy."" Well, this stick has the opposite problem. With the gamepad I had the settings turned all the way down and still struggled. With the ST290 I have the sensitivity settings cranked all the way up, and it still feels too slow in an aerial dogfight. The gamepad ""sticks"" have about one inch of travel total (all the way left, to all the way right). This joystick (stick alone, NOT including the base) is almost eight inches tall, and requires about seven inches of travel to go from extreme left to extreme right. This would be fine if I were flying a DC10 in a flight simulator, but I'm getting crushed in the fighter plane game. So, no quality complaints from me, this just wasn't what I needed."
4,Sound Factory days,"Those who know Junior from his double CD sets may not find what they're looking for here, but those who know the older sound from his days at Sound Factory may very well find this CD worth its import price. It has a few old gems like Felix da Housecat's ""In the Dark We Live (Thee Lite)"" (which contains the ""ping"" sound Junior resurrects for Charlotte's ""Don't Be Afraid""). He also supplies here two takes on his classic ""Didn't I Know (Divas to the Dancefloor)."" The repetition is not at all redundant -- the CD rises so subtly to such an insistent level of energy by the last third that I don't even let myself play the CD at all unless I have time to listen all the way through. Those who are ready for diva detox will find this a rewarding palette cleanser."
1,Disappointing!,"I was really disappointed when I read this book. If you've read the 12 steps of compulsive overeating, then you've pretty much read this book. It tells you the same thing. It takes forever to get you to the place where you can create your own meal plan...and what a joke! There's no way I can stick to something like that. I would starve too death!In conclusion, I do NOT recommend buying this book. It did not help me at all."
1,A disappointment,"What a disappointment! The authors’ answer to binge-eating is simply eliminating all sugar, flour, fat, caffeine, or whatever your “trigger” foods are from your diet. Not only that, but they insist you must weigh and measure your food all the time for the rest of your life. That’s hardly what I consider freeing yourself from obsessing about food. They actually recommend keeping an emergency food kit in your car to be sure you always have measuring cups, a food scale, and several cans of “safe” food available to you at all times. Perhaps this is wise advice for people who are morbidly obese, but for those of us who are at a normal weight, or only slightly over, and are looking for some insight and realistic advice on dealing with compulsive/binge eating, this book is NOT the answer!"
2,Too structured,"The title is far better than the actual book. All it does it make you even more obsessed with food, and now even sugars in fruits are bad! I don't like the strictly outlined nutritional program--I don't think that works for people who ""can't stop eating"". I know that strictly outlined nutritional programs don't work for me. I know from personal experience that most of the time when people can't stop eating, someone giving you a new list of things you can't eat isn't going to help much. All this book did was make me feel more helpless in the face of my binge-eating disorder."
1,Didn't work as planned,"I bought this lock because my dogs discovered they could worm their way out of the gate and run into the street (when i just had the GT500 opener). I thought this would be perfect to lock the gate in place with no chance of their escape. What I found was after hours of adjustments, it would not time itself correctly to lock when shut and to release when opened. It would try to open even though the latch was still locked (latch would open and close back before the gate would start to open). I finally removed the lock when it malfunctioned so bad, it bent the arm of my GT500 opener. Luckily I bought the opener at a local store and they swapped it out for me. The new opener has worked fine since I took the lock off."
2,Should have worked longer,"I installed two lightweight gates using the Mighty Mule openers, sensors, and automatic locks. After over a year, everything is still working Except the automatic locks. First, one of the gates refused to open and I turned off the lock with the key and the gate works without it and then a couple of months later, the other gate refused to open and I disabled that one as well.I think they should have worked longer."
5,Works perfect!,Have had this for over a year and it still works perfect. Have had no problems with it whatsoever! Great buy!
3,Excellent Idea,"It's a bit senseless to install a gate without some sort of locking device. Therefore, this lock is a relatively necessary addition to the Mighty Mule gate opener. However, the ""floating"" receiving pin doesn't always allow the lock to activate, thereby rendering the thing useless. I had to customize the unit to work consistently."
1,Disappointing and very short interview. Poor sound quality.,Mark Knopfler talks about some peripheral issues with his Dire Straits career and also his work with movie soundtracks to an anonymous interviewer. There is no introduction of the interview and it ends abruptly without any seeming order or development to the discussion. The quality of the recording is quite poor with sounds of traffic and other activity in the background. This is unfortunately a kind of 'fly-on-the-wall' recording which is more like bar talk than a formal interview geared towards an audience.
3,A good interwiew i guess.....well it works. it must be...,"it maybe wacky but i have really not listen to this,.one, maybe should. but as i known , an interwiew whith this legends can't be bad or wrong, beacuse of annoynig noise and something liek this, well yes, annoying maybe, but whorth spending time on.Also a very nice,and very fine album picture bye. an always fan."
1,"Horrible Quality, Not the Same Pattern","This set is so different from all of my other Italian Countryside pieces that I can't believe they call this the same pattern. It should be a completely different line.The pieces are much heavier and thicker, fleckier, and even the pattern is fatter and not finely detailed like on the everyday china pattern. It is closer to a white/gray than the rich cream of the original pattern.I have only gotten 2 bowls wet, and both have turned a disgusting gray color as a result. After contacting Mikasa I was told this is how stoneware is and that the bowls would turn back after a couple of days. It has been a couple of weeks and they are still a sickly gray.I am so disappointed in this set that I am hesitant about buying more Italian Countryside accessories for fear they will be of the same shoddy quality."
1,do not buy they absorb water and discolor,Do not buy they absorb water and turn a brownish tan. They will not match the other pieces in the set that are sealed!
1,Cheaply made cd.,"This interview cd has no liner notes,no track listings and no information.It is just a cheaply made,cobbled together collection of interviews with the Beatles in Australia with no indication or information as to where or when they took place.The cover is just a single slip of paper and the back cover has no information at all.There are better interview discs available."
3,Beatles Talkie,"In the 1960s when The Beatles burst to fame many record companies tried to cash in on their fame, of course most of them had no music to offer, but that didn't stop them issuing interview LPs or albums of cover versions by bands like ""The Mersey Boys"" or ""Sounds Like Beatles"".Today this is still happening as can be proven by this disc. It is interesting to the major fan, but you can get much more information about the band in one of the countless books that are available about the band."
2,Mouse only likes some surfaces,"The mouse itself isn't bad. Good luck finding a surface that it likes though. I have tried 2 different mouse pads, my desk, and a piece of paper. The mouse only likes the paper. It's very selective about which surface you use. I do NOT recommend this mouse."
1,Do NOT buy this mouse EVER,"Worked okay the first couple weeks, then the software that you install wont load on startup making you have to manually start it. Then the program just shuts down and doesn't come back on. And it always seemed that in middle of games the mouse would just stop working, but the red light was still on underneath. And unplugging, then plugging back in didn't resolve this problem, no you have to completely restart your computer and hope it starts working again. Then after a long battle in my computer game Crysis the mouse stopped working and i got a bullet in my head, at which point i realized this mouse isnt worthy of living anymore and i just chucked the thing at the wall and broke it to pieces. Wouldn't buy it again if it was selling for $0.99, its a waste of your money."
2,"I agree, mostly...","I agree with the first review of this product. The mouse is actually pretty nice, but the software that comes with it is just terrible. Caused my XP SP2 to crash non-stop. Once I uninstalled the GE software and just let Windows find it (it had to search for a driver online using the automatic driver installation wizard), it worked fine. It doesn't have all the options that came with the GE software, but atleast it works. I don't recommend this mouse either until they get the software upgraded."
1,Terrible product,"The mouse controls the cursor for a second upon login then stops responding. Uninstallation of the software locks the computer. Given the number of similarly atrocious reviews for this product, the manufacturer appears to be using the public as unpaid product testers. Still, some reviews appear good. Would you like to risk your computer to try your luck? System: Windows XP/Pentium 4."
2,Finish cracking and peeling,"I have had this mouse about 4 months when the finish started cracking and peeling the top of my mouse looks like the side of a 50 year old house. Even peeling on the side buttons. Works ok, just uncomfortable to touch."
2,good when it works,"I've had two of these mice for about a year. They work great, when they work. Both mice constantly just stop working. I'll be using it just fine then all of a sudden NOTHING. I have to unplug it and plug it back in again, and then it works again. Some days i do this 6 or 7 times, other times it can go several days with no problem. I use one at home (light use) and one at work (heavy use), and they both have issues. When it works, i love it. It fits my hand great, the buttons are all in the perfect location and there's no ball to worry about getting jammed with crud. But having to constantly unplug it is starting to wear on me and i am now in the market for a new mouse."
2,first one worked,"I bought this mouse before and it lasted me a long time, this time I bought it, the cord as messed up or something, kept shutting off so id have to replug it back in, anyways, good mouse if u get one that works well."
1,Terrible software,"Totally agree with comments aboveMy mouse comes with USB plug, everything was working fine till about one month ago it started messing with USB ports. Now I can not use any flash memory sticks without unplugging my mouse at first, if mouse is plugged in, computer crashes immediately. I tried to reinstall mouse software several times, but it made everything even worse and it seems I will have to reinstall Windows now.Don't use it even if someone gives it to you for free."
4,Decent for the price,"I got 3 of these for our counter. We have had it for about 2 months now. For the price, it isn't bad. We have used it enough, that we know it's not really meant for heavier people ( over 225 lbs ). It is easy to assemble, but one of the stools had one leg piece that just wouldn't flush agaisnt another piece and we ended up stripping the screw that was supposed to tighten it together so we have a gap that's slightly noticeable. They are very lightweight and the seat is very ""cushy"", not firm. You tend to sink into it a little. It's made of pleather or whatever it is, so it can stick to your skin. Otherwise, not bad for the price considering how pricey good bar stools can be. It does look really great in my espresso colored kitchen. I do still wish I had spent the extra to get a more solid product. Oh well, I hope these last at least 3 years and I'll be happy with that."
4,Very hard to put together,"I just received this item and found it very hard to put together. I think I received the wrong instructions or have parts missing. We called the customer support line and they said that there has been some changes with that product that we should know about. I wish I would have known this before I ordered it. Good quality greenhouse though, if I can ever get it together the right way."
3,Not the scent I was looking for.,Seller does not indicate how many oz. It is (2) oz. It is highly concentrated. The frangrance lasts for a while. I do think it is high quality but it wasn't quite the scent I was looking for. For me it leaves somewhat of a bitter sweet scent.
1,The design is failure,"I will not buy this product, because the design (Green Dragon) looks horrible.The green ugly dragon makes me feel uncomfortable.So, I will stop here and will not buy it, even I am a green tea lover."
2,This green tea made me blue,"Although this is a negative review, you will not find a bigger fan of Celestial Seasonings tea than me, which is why this variety of tea disappointed me so. The original blend without white tea was so much better. It was a perfect balance of tartness and sweetness. This new blend, on the other hand, tastes like lawn mower clippings. I would expect that from Bigelow or Yogi tea, but not my beloved Celestial Seasonings. Although I can understand the desire for innovation, sometimes the adage holds true: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" CS had the perfect forumula before, and they ruined it. Sadly, I will have to break my monogamous relationship with CS and try other brands of green tea. Good thing that I received a free sample of this tea to try and didn't waste my hard-earned money on a whole package of it."
2,Why Did They Do It?,"I'm a huge fan of Celestial Seasonings. Even worked for them, years ago. Their green tea was one of my favorite non-loose varieties. Now, they've gone and messed with it, adding white tea for ""smoothness."" Well, if I wanted white tea, I'd BUY white tea (and it would be silver needle organic).Was so disappointed to get the box, and discover that the pure, lightly vegetal green tea taste was gone. Am bummed that they changed the blend, to say the least. Worst part is, the new blend doesn't taste as good as Stash's ""Fusion,"" which is also a green/white mix...Please bring back our green tea, Celestial Seasonings!"
1,Why the white tea blend?,"I really cannot emphasize how disappointed I am with Celestial Seasoning's having ruined its perfectly good green tea. The company has apparently totally eliminated production of plain green tea in favor of blends with white tea. On the box it says ""with White Tea for Smooth Taste.""Smooth taste my foot -- the white tea bitters it.Can you imagine if you're a Folgers drinker 3 times a day for 10 years and then all of the sudden Folgers adds Essence of Municipal Garbage to its coffee? Yeah -- that's what celestial seasonings did to me. Thanks, guys!You forced me to go Bigelow!"
1,Terrible! Why did they change it?,They had a classic tea and now they decided to experiment with it. I don't like the change. Why can't they offer the old one as well. Maybe these other reviews are about the previous version.
2,"cheap stick, doesn't last too long",I've had this stick for maybe four years now. It can only work for the simplest games. For the few bucks not bad. If you want to do flight sims or the type of complicated games like WWiiOnline .. don't use this stick. I clamp my down to the table so it has some support. Otherwise you get a sore hand from having to hold it down.Not a well designed stick. Spend a few more bucks on something in the $40-50 range. You'd end up paying more if you get this one.
2,Not what I expected.,"Pat Boyack's first 3 albums (with the Prowlers) were some good listening, foot tapping, rockin' blues.Great guitar work....tight band....my type of stuff.This album, however fine it may be, is WAY different from anything in the first 3 albums. ""Voices from the Street"" really has a more gospelly/R&B type sound. There are, in fact, numerous tracks on this CD in which Pat's guitar work is definitely kept in the background.I guess I'm missing the point behind a CD by a guitar player in which the guitar player is NOT featured.As I said above....perhaps a very fine album...such as it is....but not what I want to hear from Pat Boyack....at least not given his first 3 albums.If you enjoyed the original Pat Boyack and the Prowlers albums you should be well aware that THIS album is significantly different in nature from those."
2,Only good for bagels,If you are planning on using this toaster for waffles or regular toast forget it. The slots are wide enought for bagles but with smaller (regular) size breads they slide down and get stuck. I sent mine back.
3,Toaster,"Looks great and seems heavy duty, but it does not toast evenly at all. Half the elements don't heat up. It takes a longer than my last, more expensive toaster from Bed, Bath, & Beyond to toast. Overall, it's just ok and I won't order another."
1,Don't waste your money!!,I read this book after someone heard Janice give a talk on it...don't waste your money!!!
3,Little dissapointed,"The book was just ok. I thought it was way over priced, I expected to get lots of ideas for building a fabulous display along with directions. There were a few ideas and the discriptions could have been better. I will still use the book and ideas but had I looked at the book before buying it sight unseen, I probably wouldn't have bought it."
2,Are you kidding me?,"If you have an ounce of creativity, don't waste $25. I was hoping for SO much more. Yes, it has photos, many of which aren't even crisply in focus. This is a THIN book, with little descriptions on HOW things are made. Only brief summaries about grouping like buildings together, being symmetrical with the weight of grouping (balance) and repeating like elements; color, shape....How did this get published? I am going to make my own display and write a better book than what is out there."
4,Village Display Tips,Probably a good book for the right people. I thought it would help with scenery design for 1/144th scale dolls' houses and it was not valuable for that purpose. But interesting all the same.
3,Interviews,"Awesome interviews. Elvis didn't really give to many interviews during his career. Most were done while he was in the army. It's neat to hear an early 1955 interview, which may be the first interview we have available to listen to, where he is called the bopping hillbilly. Also has excerpts from the New York Press Confrence from 1972. Not for the casual listener. For the true fan."
4,Nice Sheets!,Very comfy. I actually think I sleep a tad better in these sheets than I was sleeping before I bought them. They seem to be holding up well to the weekly washings. Off to a good start - now we'll just have to see how long they last!
1,Useless artifact!,"I wanted to give it no stars, it's a piece of junk. Cannot toast or stay in one piece. I've sent it back, with my opinion enclosed. Beware, don't purchase this item!"
4,Friday The 13th Double Feature,"Four stars for the movies themselves, but beware, you get NO extras on this at all! On the back of the case, it says there are theatrical trailers for each film but there aren't when you put the disc (which, by the way, there is only one disc, not two) into the player. No biggie to me, I got this for 10 bucks and can easily watch the trailers on YouTube but it's still annoying when they say something is included and it's not! Buyer beware, but not bad for those who want to replace their worn out VHS copies of these movies as I did :)"
1,You've got to be kidding?,"I can't believe Paramount has the you-know-what to release these two classics in their ""butchered"" versions again. What the hell is it with them already? Die hard Friday the 13th fans are ready to open their wallets for an ""uncut"" pressing of these films. What's the matter, Paramount? Are you not feeling well?If it weren't for the fact that they control Star Trek, I'd have boycotted them a long time ago.Thankfully, I own the PAL release of the first movie which was distributed by Warner. It's great. Go and get yourself a copy and while you're at it, get a multi-region player as well so you can watch the DVD.Let me go before I say something I'll regret."
5,Friday the 13th part 1 & 2,All Dvd's were received in excellent condition!Thanks for the prompt deliveries.
5,This is powerful!,"For those of us who missed seeing Malcolm in person, this will give you a sense in why he is a sage of the hightest order. I am humbled at his way in which he makes us think. Very powerful."
2,Dissappointed brotha,"I was very dissapointed with the content of this product. The audio wasvery noisy and worse the content. I was expecting some nourishing thoughton the plight of black people akin to the teachings of Minister Farrakanbut I found profound hate speech. Malcolm sounded very hateful and the name calling over and over again of ""blue eyed devils"" was too much to take. It seems his writings are much more easier to digest than his speeches."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!! IT IS NOT WHAT IT SAYS.,"I bought this book in hopes of practicing for the Biochemistry GRE. Sadly, this book contains a lot of information NOT EVEN COVERED ON THE TEST. The test does not cover in depth organic chemistry, taxonomy, physiology, and other topics, but this book extensively takes a lot of this material from other tests(like the MCAT and the biology GRE). IN SHORT DO NOT BUY THIS IT WILL NOT HELP YOU AT ALL. Buy the book from ETS, it is MUCH more helpful."
1,Rudmans Biochem GRE,"This is a terrible, terrible book. The questions are either far too simple, suited for a biology GRE or completely worthless: What was the name of the chimpanzee that spent 38 years with Jane Goodall? If anyone can explain how that relates to biochem, cell or molecular biology, I will eat the book. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK! ABSOLUTLEY WORTHLESS!"
2,There are better choices for getting girls interested in poetry.,I bought this to read aloud to my class because it was suggested at a conference. Unfortunately I was sadly disappointed when I first opened it up. It just wanders through adolescence in a way that sounds like any ordinary girl. It doesn't make poetry more welcome to girls or to anyone. I haven't bothered to read any of the poems to the class. I just added it to the shelf since I'd spent the $ on it.
5,Breaking the Code,"This book is truly an insight into a young girl's heart. It fit the ying of my school life's yang. All the pain and pleasure I felt as a teen is mirrored by this girl's point of view. I was charmed. I would have like to have like to dated her myself.Maybe I did date people like her, I just never knew what was going one behind the scenes."
3,Over-priced for the quality.,"This is an A-list wannabe. Decent scent, but not worth the $55 price tag. Would pay $30-$40 max."
5,a sacred journey within discovering my inner self,"As so many of us look outside ourselves for ways of reaching the understanding and meaning to our lifes, David Feinstein and Stanley Krippner, provide us with a sacred journey through which we discover our inner self. A Mythic Path is a Psycho-spiritual journey through which self appreciation, respect and love is ultimately embraced. Each stage provides a path through which you reach this ultimate experience. It is a comprehensible program designed to help the layman and the professinal. As a spiritual counselor who experience this program first hand, I can attest it's validity not only in my life, but in my own personal practice as well. Thank you for your wisdom......"
5,The Best Book on Personal Mythology,"Stanley Krippner and David Feinstein's work in The Mythic Path book is nothing short of amazing. I used the book as a textbook in one of my classes at Pacifica. The book takes the reader through simple yet effective self-exploration exercises that get at the foundational (and often hidden) beliefs about life, family, work, and relationships. This is an exploratory tool for recognizing and re-patterning these core beliefs. And it does so without an overlay of external symbolic systems. Krippner and Feinstein's approach to mythology is in ""personal mythology"", so it does not explore the global themes in world mythology and folklore. Rather, it asks the reader to express the core values of his or her life. In this way the book doesn't confuse personal stories with compelling external narratives. Rather, it a sincere plumbing of one's own personal depths. And an imaginative exploration of what the present and future now have to offer."
4,GOOD FOR LEG CRAMPS!,"Hyland's Leg Cramps with Quinine, 100 Tablets (Pack of 3)UNABLE OBTAIN QUININE VIA DOCTOR, I AM GETTING LEG CRAMP RELIEF FROM THIS PROBLEM WITH ""LEG CRAMP W/QUININE"".MY DOCTOR STOPPED PRESCRIBED A RX FOR QUININE.HE SAID THAT THE GOVT. SAID THAT IT (QUININE) CAUSES HEART PROBLEMS.I FOUND THE ABOVE OVER THE COUNTER PILL WHICH HAS HELPED ME WITH LEG CRAMPING, AT A MUCH LOWER COST."
1,Leg cramps,I did not find this product to be helpful at all. I found drinking Tonic water with Quinine in it more helpful.
4,Coleman is smokin on the record!,"Two bassist, one bowed on plucked. On first listen this might sound like a mess but it works really well. Under Colemans bluesy,lyrical playing. The very fast drumming. The whole becomes like one of those magic pictures that on first sight looks like static but instead of your eyes you have to soft focus your mind. This is a very exciting jazz record. My favorite from Coleman in a long while. The slower numbers remind a little of the Dirty Three, which is a good thing. The only reason that it doesn't get five stars is the recording is a little muddy, hearing the separation of the basses a little more would have been great. But get it anyway!"
2,Switching Instruments,"Coleman's play on different instruments showed a lot of skill, but the music seemed to lose some of its spontaneity in the process. The jazz represented to me a kind of neo-be-bop that lacked lyrical luster and moving harmonies.jwc"
5,Vibrational healing through the chakras,"Great book. You need to own this book. Gardner has really done her homework. I was amazed how much info is in this book. I actually started in the middle of the book, read a few chapters and now I have started from the front. I have learned a lot of new things, and things I didn't even think about. The only thing I disagree on is where Gardner wrote about Sundances. Perhaps the dances she has been to do no pierce but I have seen piercing and know many who do pierce. Other than that the book in a AA+ in my book. You will not be disappointed in the book."
1,Highly Disappointing!,"I can't belive some of the other review that this book has received. I had such high expectations for this, but the book did not really offer any valuable insights. It was full of silly execises. If you want to read this book, get it from the library like I did- it is not worth the money. For a great self-help book read The Power of Your Subconscious Mind by Dr. Joseph Murphy"
2,Couldn't Get Through It,"I was hoping for a book to show me how to be more charismatic, of course. But this book feel far short of that goal. The subtitle is, ""How to Discover and Unleash Your Hidden Powers,"" but it didn't help at all with that. It is a good book for self-help and explaining charismatic characteristics. But helping YOU become mroe charismatic will require far more than this book. Thirteen kinds of charisma, imagination, how to stop putting yourself down, anger, breathing, overcoming performance anxiety.... Just a few things covered in this book that will help you feel calmer, perhaps more in control around others, but that's about it."
3,Exercise after exercise,"I expected this book to do a deep analysis of what charisma is, and to study it based on the experience of leaders who most people would agree have some type of charisma. Instead, this turned out to be a self-help book about how to gain it, without ever showing that the techniques presented are really effective from any standpoint(scientific or otherwise).I had the distinct feeling while reading the book that I was being convinced to take up yoga, rather than charisma. When I bought this book, I was skeptical that charisma could be taught; I am now even more convinced."
1,No help here,"This book didn't give me any clue about how to become more charismatic. The basic premise of the book is that we need to stay in tune with our bodies. This book provided many superficial physical exercises that seemed completely unrelated from the subject at hand. The author suggests that almost every problem can be solved by breathing deeply. If you belive this - by all means, go ahead and buy the book. For me, it was hard to weed through the wordiness, and the disconnected and jumpy chapters kept me from focusing. In summary, I'd say that this book simply doesn't give any real solutions for gaining charisma."
5,One of the finest writers ever,"Kipling is little appreciated today, and that's a shame, because he was one of the finest short-story writers the world has ever produced. The closest word I can find to describe his stories is ""hynotic."" Such an imagination...many of the stories are understated horror and fantasy: stories of talking trains, of wild rides that end up in hellish worlds, of frighteningly realistic curses by man-beasts. Some are truly puzzling, such as ""The Gardener."" Some are obviously (and disturbingly) autobiographical (""Baa Baa Black Sheep""). Kipling strikes a note few writers can: his stories can be enjoyed (and enjoyed immensely) by both children and adults. These are the kinds of stories that children love having read to them. They always clamor for more."
4,Victorian Nostalgia,"Kipling, to me, represents the closing chapter of the British Empire. All the great culture and adventure that Victorian England produced was then being slowly drawn back. Kipling's stories are earthy, human, and not easily understood these days.His short stories are easily read in one sitting and so you can pick through to find something for that moment.Much would not be considered politically correct, but that's what makes it great."
5,Can Kids Still Read Kipling?,"I got this so that my husband could read stories to my 10-year-old granddaughter -- he loves to read, she loves to be read to. Kipling provides adventure and different cultures, so I figured it would entertain them both. I had not factored in how limited our vocabularies are today. My husband had to stop frequently to explain words; occasionally, he would have to look one up. They both still enjoyed the stories. (I also think it did my granddaughter good to learn that even grown ups have to look up words; there is no stigma to using a dictionary -- or in our case, the internet.)I would recommend the book to anyone who wants their child to achieve a high score on the verbal SAT, but I think a child would be better off to have it read to him than to read it solo.The book itself is large and heavy (hardback), but the print is a comfortable size."
5,Wonderful Library Addition,Very nicely bound handsome edition with wonderful stories. I cannot wait to dig in. I am 65 and have not read Kipling's stories for 40 years (college). My all time favorite book as a child was Rikki Tikki Tavi and from there I became a Kipling fan.
5,Introduction to Beading,"This book is a great introduction into the different types of beading.The technique section includes directions on how to decorate an object with beads, string beads on wire, on a head pin for jewelry, for multiple jewelry components, string beads on needle and thread and on elastic and monofilament, how to use pressure crimps, and sewing beads on fabric.Some of the projects included are: beaded wire napkin ring, continuous loop necklace, knotted necklace, braided leather bracelet, bugle-beaded tassel, daisy chain anklet, wrapped candleholder, and Celtic knot necklace and earrings."
2,it was broken when it arrived,Broken when it arrived. I guess a mirror is something that shouldn't be shipped but bought at the shop
2,Disappointed...,"Whereas I had hoped for a selection of interviews or clips from them, this disc has only one interview, with only Morrissey (not ""The Smiths"" as promised), and the source isn't specified anywhere on the cover or disc. It's just an unnamed Australian radio show. That said, it's always interesting to hear some of Morrissey's views on money, sexuality, the Queen, fame, etc.All in all, I'd say it was a good buy for the hardcore fan, but perhaps not at the price offered here."
5,Good and to the point,This book is the best for understanding and applying KM in a company environment. It defines what you need and does not make you waste time with elaborated theories that are not useful.
3,"Solid Theory, But More Execution Tasks Needed","This book focuses on making the case for a knowledge management system. If you're already convinced and need specific, measurable steps, try a different book."
4,"J Rusten's ""Histories"" 2","Professor Rusten nearly equals Clyde Pharr in his presentation of Book II. The only advantage which Rusten does not provide is a vocabulary list. Commentary is helpful, if in the form of end notes, and fairly thorough. He presents a useful text for students of Attic Greek and to instructors of Thucydides. Either as an advanced [very] undergraduate Greek course or as part of an introductory graduate one, Rusten's edition is a valuable adjunct to the Loeb or the OCT in conjunction with the Crawley translation or the Landmark volume."
3,Changes,"In April 1972, Quicksilver released their seventh album Comin' Thru which seems to be loved by some and panned by the rest. While I like the album, for me, it does have it's weaknesses which kind of puts me in the middle. That's not to say that there isn't some good on it (Doin' Time in the U.S.A., Changes and Mojo) but there's also some stuff that sounds less inspired. For me, part of the issue has more to do with the production and mix which sometimes overplays the horns/organ and leaves the band rather nondescript sounding in places. This album was recorded rather quickly, if I remember right, and it does seem like it at times."
1,"Cuidado! no funciona con Apple, y requiere un teclado especial.","Luego de abrir junto a mi hijo el paquete tan prometedor, me doy cuenta que no es compatible con el sistema OSX de Apple. La aplicación que viene en el cdrom, es solo para WIndows. Era tan difícil migrar esa aplicación a otra plataforma?Logré instalar un Windows en una de mis Macs, pero me doy cuenta que ninguno de los teclados que tengo en mi casa sirven.Olvidarse de teclados modernos, ergonómicos.. laptops.. etc...Me vi obligado a comprar por 15 dólares un teclado USB.Cuidado al decidir la compra."
3,It's ok but not great,"Maybe I was expecting too much from this product when I bought it. The truth is that it dissapointed me.The setup on top of the keyboard can give you a real hard time if your keyboard is in spanish or any language other than english (not good for a spanish toy). This is also true if your keyboard has a ""different"" shape.As for the software goes, it's ok and kids have fun for a while. I just wish it would have more things to learn about."
4,Zewa MFM-007XL Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor,"I needed this item for monitoring my blood pressure. It was easy, but the cuff is very hard to put on for one person. I have an error on the first time I try to take my blood pressure, then I re-wrap the cuff and it works the next time. The cuff is very, very accurate. I took my blood pressure, and the doctor took my blood pressure (his way) and the difference is so small the doctor told me that my blood pressure monitor is more accurate than his method."
1,to many error codes,"i received this 24 hrs ago and half of the time i get error codes. i called customer service ( very friendly & helpful )and they informed me that they have had this problem before and recommended that i try it on my forearm due to the size of my arm. this worked a few time but if i checked after i was active it gave me a code 7&9m most of the time i got a code 3. in the book it gives code 3-5 as something wrong with the cuff and code 7-12 as something about being calm. that right only 2 errors with 9 codes. also didn't like this ""D"" ring to make it easier to put on, it makes the cuff fold over no it self. this my work for some people but not me! PS I HAVE AN 18 1/2"" ARM"
1,Wrong Item Sent,The company sent the wrong item and then proceeded to tell me they didnt' have it anyway. So item was wrong - listing was wrong and the procedure to return was left to me to figure it out - would never do business with them again.
1,Disappointed with xl cuff,I have ordered this 2 times - needing the larger cuff. The cuff that came with the unit both times did not fit into the monitor itself. Too bad because it appears to be an excellent unit!
5,holley ecu,"I bought this item from Amazon found it to be cheaper than from any other source I've found yet. It is made to replace the analog system ECU, (direct replacement). It is installed and seems to be working good for now, but It has some minor issues that I still have to work out. The instructions need to be better at troubleshooting problems, but For the most part it's pretty clear though."
5,Wonderful Tea,"This tea tastes great and is so easy to make quickly. I usually just toss a few bags in a half gallon container with some lukewarm water and throw it in the fridge, in a half an hours or so I have nice cold tea with little effort. If I want to drink it faster I can wait a few minutes and pour it into a glass with a little water. it's also delicious, much better tasting than Liptons cold brew tea. I just wish it were easier to find in stores."
5,Cool brew Blueberry tea,"This is one of the best tasting teas I have used. Keeps well in the refrigerator for two days, retaining its excellent flavor. I reccommend this tea to everyone, and have shared with many family and friends."
1,so far from fresh.,"Product Amazon sent me Feb 2008 had been expired since April 2007 (!)CS would not send me a replacement, admitting that I would probably get expired tea again if retry.Note this pattern with a lot of grocery items -- that the expiration date is never checked at all by Amazon. If you want fresh grocery items, Amazon is not the place. :("
3,My Son Loves It,The mat was thinner than i had anticipated (i have hardwood floors and there really isn't enough padding in the actual mat). I can not figure out how to fill the water up in it :/ however the pillow on it was great. i started using this mat with my son around a month and the pillow game him that lil bit of extra support. Though he could already support himself pretty well my goal was for him to learn how to roll over and the pillow definately helped to accomplish that task. He LOVES the toys that came attached to it. My son loved the mat. Tho i don't think its worth that high of a price for what it is.
3,It's cute but..,"I fell in love with the looks of this mat when I was registering for my baby. It's so adorable. But it wasn't the most fun.. my son wasn't really interested in it for long.. and the pillow was too high for him. I would find him trying to inch off the pillow instead. The fish are cute, but trying to get the water in the pocket was almost impossible. It's a cute idea for tummy time.. maybe just remove the pillow first? The price is right though."
2,Cute but a waste of money,"I gave this two stars because it is a cute concept but as far as a tummy-time mat it really is pointless. The point of tummy time is for baby to use his/her muscles on his/her own and by having a pillow under baby it really defeats the purpose. My son sometimes enjoyed himself and sometimes didn't but in the end we rarely ever did tummy time and when we would I would just put him on a blanket on the floor, sit on my tummy in front of him and shake a rattle. They make so many cute toys and things out there that catch new mommy and daddys' eyes but in the end my son is rolling over without having used his tummy time mat very often at all."
2,i had a hard time filling mine with water,i had a very hard time getting mine full with water...it said to remove valve...when i did that is was sealed shut so no water would go in....i'm sure my son would like it if i could get the water in....
4,love it so far,"My daughter is 10 weeks; I haven't given her much 'tummy time' because as soon as I laid her on her tummy, she'd either cry, or fall asleep. I bought the mat, hoping it would spark her interest, and she would start to actually enjoy tummy time. I got it in the mail today, filled the water part, and tried it out; total success! She lay and stared at the floaties for about 15 minutes; then she looked at the toys on the rings for another 10 minutes each. My only complaint is that the rings come apart too easily. Oh, yah - it is pretty thin; since I have hardwood floors, I put a blanket under it."
2,Skeptical of Tummy Time Mats,"I got so excited when I saw this tummy-time mat. My enthusiasm was hedged when I read that the water pouch needed to be EMPTIED DAILY. If had known that little detail, I would not have registered for this mat. I must also confer that the neat little toys do stick together - bummer. Honestly, now I am skeptical of any ""tummy time"" mat. I think my boys prefer a brightly colored, patterned blanket, toys within reach, and lots of parent encouragement to stimulate their tummy time needs. Better off spending the money elsewhere."
4,Good but not doctor recommended,"I likes this and so di dnoy son, I agree the water was hard to put in and empty and I did not do it every day as rocommended. I talked with my doctor and realized that this is an inhibiter. This will prevent my child from actually learning to use his arms and legs on his own. My doctor said flat on a clean floor or blanket was the baet way, this way he has to raise his head to see what is going on rather than be propped up and ""cheating"" I thought this made senses and stopped using it. It was nice while it lasted though."
3,"just okay, nothing special","We received three different mats, and I can honestly say, I would not have bought any of them. We have one (I believe it's Infantino) that is wider and we used longer b/c we could spread out toys and such on it. Here's why I did/didn't like this mat:* the creatures stick in the water and the child can't really enjoy the water part until he/she can hold up its head* the pillow is useless-- my son was never comfortable on the pillow, but did just fine w/o it* once the child starts rolling (which isn't that long--around 4+ months) or scooting, you can forget about it, the mat becomes useless* the best part were the toys--- my son LOVED the links, only complaint is they come apart really easily"
1,Terrible!!!,"This mat is terrible! It's very poorly made. Everything about it seems cheap. Within 1/2 hour of us filling it with water, the entire thing had leaked through the side of the pouch (not the hole to pour the water into) and soaked the mat and our carpet. Not only did it soak through but the dye in the material stained our carpet pink. I would never recommend this product to anyone!"
2,Nice idea but...,"My baby does not like this toy at all. I wanted to stimulate her, by helping her push up better, and getting her upper body stronger, and I thought the mat looked like fun. Every time I lay my little girl on it she starts to cry within seconds. She seems so uncomfortable on the prop that she doesn't even take the time to discover the hanging toys, or bother with the swimming creatures. It's also a pain to have to take what little free time I have in the day after she goes to sleep, to empty and refill the water cushion with sea creatures. Additionally the water creatures stick together really easily while you are filling the toy, and they are hard to get apart. I wouldn't bother with this one."
1,Don't like it much!,"My son hated this mat at first, then he played in/with it for about 5 days...after that, it got old! Mighty quickly. My son is now about to make 5 months old, and he doesn't even want to look at it. Waste of money for me."
3,it works for what it's worth,"my daughter is 4 months and she hated tummy time. I've tried the boppy pillow but she didn't like it until we tried this Tummytime Mat. She doesn't play with anything that comes with this mat but the pillow helps props her up so she can look around.I gave this mat 3 stars because after just the 1st wash, gentle cycle with Dreft, the fabric looks pretty faded. Plus, I had to borrow my husband's strong hands to fill the aquarium pouch. From the picture, I thought the mat is somewhat cushioned but it doesn't. The toys that come with this mat is pretty lame as well."
2,"You can't ""spot clean"" spit up","Do not register for this thing. You have to put water in the little aquarium pocket and empty it daily--what a hassle. The mat itself is machine washable but the pillow, which gets drenched in drool and spit up, can only be lightly surface-cleaned. Pretty gross. We used ours for less than a month and than tossed it."
2,"Cute But ""Aquarium"" Too Difficult","I bought it because we love surfboards. However, the little aquarium is too difficult to fill and empty - I never successfully did either one - and the instructions say it should be done daily!?! In addition, the pillow ends up full of saliva and the instructions say to give it only a light surface wash - gross!"
4,Very Cute!,My daughter is 3 months old now and she really likes the Tummy Time Surfboard. She isn't able to stay on her tummy propped with the pillow for an extended period of time yet mainly because it exhausts her. She seems to be very interested in the water and colorful toys in front of her. All of the stimulation and work of holding up her head always ends up in a nap directly after I pick her up :)
4,Too small for charts - but works for voice over copy,"Have to agree that this handy little stand isn't right for sheet music, but as a voice performer I usually have only a few pages of copy to deal with and for that it's a handy device. K & M makes a similar product but at a higher price. If you don't have - or have room for - a separate music/copy stand AND a microphone stand I think this is a great solution.H2"
3,Raxxess ASML is NOT that large...,"Never having seen this product before you would assume by the picture that it is more like the size of a normal music stand. Well, it isn't. The base is only 6 or 7 inches wide and the metal is kind of flimsy. I was expecting something a bit bigger. I would hate to have bought the small one thinking this one was to big. This is not very large!!!"
3,Pure barre Pershing square2,"Really missed the arm workout that you do in the actual class, but did get a good leg and butt burn."
2,so so,"I have many dvd's of ballet bar workouts, this is not my favorite. The music is too obnoxious, the style of the owner Carrie is just too much, the video looks cheap, overall I wish I had spent my money on another Lotte Berk or Bar Method dvd!If you are looking for a great bar workout go to the original and bypass these newer copies-bc that is all it is, a copy.Lotte Berk and Bar Method are the best with cuing, non-obnoxious music and results!"
4,Tetra Food,The fish seem to like it. I got some great pond advice when I called the company to ask questions. They were very helpful.
2,Wrong country,This book is written by a British writer for a British audience. It is of limited value in the US. Many of the trees shown are not available here. The language is of course British and the meanings of some of the words used are not readily apparent to an American reader. The book does contain good information (for a Brit).
1,Unfairly priced,"Although there remains a paucity of books devoted solely to renal ultrasonography, this text fails to deliver on its educational objective. You'd be better off using a text that offers ultrasounds with better resolutions or an internet-site that allows you to adjust the contrast and scale the images for a better look at the kidneys and other structures. The book simply isn't worth the asking price."
2,Very Old Anthropological Study,"This was a very early anthropological study of the Seminole, so early that I suspect it was one of the first ever performed. It's very heavy reading, and was meant solely as a scientific document. I can't speak for its importance as a scientific resource for those seriously studying the Seminoles-- I'm in no way qualified to make such a judgment. My two-star rating is meant to reflect its interest to the general reader of non-fiction, which is very low indeed."
4,Pretty good for money spent!,"We love the stroller. I have three three year olds and a six year old. My boys can ALL sit in it when needed. It also has this little strap with a handle that the third boy uses to walk beside me. My daughter complains (6) that her head is not supported! It folds easy, fits in the vehicle easy and over all does just what we wanted it to!"
4,"Great stroller, questionable tires","After using the stroller one time it seems like it is going to be great. It is very easy to handle and folds nicely. However, one of the tires has already gone flat from a puncture of a sticker weed. I don't know if this is coincidence or if the tubes are poor quality. There is a remedy to this situation. I will be replacing original tubes with thorn resistant ones (a $20-$30 price tag)."
4,InStep Safari Swivel Double Stroller,"This stroller is great for the twins, and the price was very competitive with major retailers (especially with free shipping). The stroller is very light and manageable. It turns on a dime and is fun to use. Our stroller did arrive with a damaged hinge for the canopy. However, I called the 1-800 number and they sent me a new one without question or hassel. It arrived within a couple of days. Overall, we are very pleased."
4,GREAT STROLLER,My 3 and 17 month old love this stroller. They like being side-by-side and both of my children are 95% in height and they fit perfect in it. I really like it a lot. It turns and moves very easily opposed to my other double stroller which wasn't side-by-side. I'm very happy with this product.
3,You get what you pay for,"I took this stoller out of the box, put the wheels on and stood it up (very easy to assemble). It just looked cheap. There are no extra pockets for the kids or parents. My 2 1/2 year old daughters head looked like it was hitting the ""sun canopy"". The sun canopy is a waste of fabric, there is no way that it will cover the sun from the kids eyes, it tilts up!! I put this right back into the box and sent it back right away. I am now getting a BOB instead. You definately get what you pay for."
4,Two happy kids and two happy parents,"Great price and great stroller. I did quite a bit of research at the request of my coworkers who wanted to buy a congratulatory stroller for my wife and I. I could not stomach the thought of sticking anyone (sane) with a $500+ stroller bill - the InStep seemed perfect. In short, we have loved this thing from day one. It rides great and, with the exception of a slow leak in one tire (fixed with foam), we have had no problems. As mentioned in other reviews, there is not much protection from the sun, so the Kiddopotamus Rayshade is rather necessary. Note on that ... the shade is not very steady when windy. Good luck with your search!"
3,It's OK,"After doing LOTS of research I decided on this double jogging stroller and have tested it out this week. The seats don't sit up quite as much as I wish they would have. Also, Amazon says the stroller comes with a parent tray, but it does not. It supposedly comes with a parent console which is a soft-sided bag with a drink holder on the side, although mine was not included. After contacting InStep, they said they would send me one. I specifically ordered this stroller because Amazon said it came with a ""tray"", so I am disappointed. The stroller does seem to handle well, though.BOTTOM LINE: This stroller is fine for the money but if you can spend a little more & get something better, I would!"
4,Overall happy with jogger,"I really like this jogger. It is smooth and easy to control/steer. I don't run with it, but use it every day to walk to school to drop off my son. My main negative feedback is that it is not balanced for when there is only one child in it. It shakes, makes a lot of noise, and is harder to control/steer. I also wish the handle bar was higher. I am 5'8"" and I feel like I have to lean a little to hold onto it comfortably. Other than that though, it is great. I have three preschoolers and they have all had their turn in it. All of them like the fit and ride."
1,BABY AGE is a TERRIBLE Store. Filed BBB complaint,"Bought stroller from BABY AGE and opened it. Did not like the stroller, handle is too low, but I'm six foot tall. Called about returning the stroller. I was told that if it was rolled around the house it was considered USED and could not be returned. This is NOT the return policy is listed on their site.Filed complaint with Better Business Bureau. Company a NIGHTMARE to deal with."
4,Big and Bulky,I bought this stroller because I have a 2 year old and a 3 month old and didn't want to push 2 strollers. It was very easy to push around and big enough to hold all kinds of things. The one problem is that it is big and heavy. It wouldn't fit in my trunk and it weighs 40 lbs. or so. It didn't fit thru my front door but I didn't have too much trouble in getting into stores doors. Will probably take some getting used to.
4,"Handles well, nice product",We have really liked it. One of the attachments for the cover was broken in the box but InStep shipped us one out without a problem. I would recommend this stroller.
1,Maybe if you're 5ft nothin',My husband is 5'8 and I'm 5'11 and the handle for this stroller was so low that it put our wrists in an akward position. As for the swivel action just like all the other swivel double joggers I've tried the stupid wheel shakes if you go faster than a slow walk or hit a bump in the road. I have given up on the double jogging stroller that swivels. Save your money and get one that doesn't swivel because you'll just end up locking the wheel anyways.
4,Easy To Use,"We bought this stroller over a year ago. The first one we got actually broke (the front wheel) but we sent it back and got the second one. I like this stroller because it is very easy to maneuver when the front wheel isn't locked. It doesn't go through some doorways at stores, etc. very easily, but it is a great general purpose stroller especially for walks. The price is good and this is an overall good stroller. It does fold up easily but it is a little difficult to put into our car's trunk, but it is a double stroller so I don't expect it to be too compact."
3,Does the job,"I am impressed with the ease of use. This stroller is lightweight and very easy to push with 2 kids in it. The quality of the frame is not as good as a BoB but it is also much less expensive. Sun canopy is an issue and have to buy extra one. No place for bottles of water except underneath the stroller. Kids do lean in towards each other. With all that, I still would reccommend stroller for those not wanting to pay Bob price."
3,Almost Perfect,"I love everything about this stroller for my 2 yr. old twins. It turns on a dime, it's comfy for the kids and doesn't hurt my back to push it all over Disneyland; but, it is too wide. I'd like to take two inches off the width."
4,"Good double Stroller, Great Price!","Just received the stroller and assembled it in about 20mins. Sturdy construction as well as having features that weren't given in the description, ie the front wheel is capable of locking into place as well as freely rotating. After reading a couple reviews I was worried about the ""leaning seats"" issue. Not a problem, seats can be individually raised to about a 85 angle, maybe they just didn't read the manual.The only beef I have with the stroller is the actual beef of it. It is not compact by any means which is typical for a jogger. Folded down I would estimate the size to be about 2.5ft wide x 3ft tall x 1.5 deep. It takes up a lot of space if you,re planning on taking this thing on a vacation. But other than that I have no issues with it and would highly recommend it. If you don't care about the colors you can get this for a steal here w/ free shipping. Hope this helps."
4,Great stroller for walks even on the beach!,"This stroller is great! It's easy to put together, and my boys seem to love it! We've had it at the beach twice (in the sand) and it works great, especially once you get through the loose sand. I did end up getting the BOB cup holder, and that helped a lot with water & key / phone storage. If you do take it on the beach, because of the sand and salt water, the aluminum wheels will start to rust....just rinse them clean after each run."
4,Jogging stroller makes good replacement for any double stroller,It is a very easy to push and maneuver. The only complaint so far is that the joint between the hadlebar and the frame of the stroller is a bit weak and tends to wobble. Other than that a very good stroller for the price.
4,So Far so Good!,"It has worked out well for us so far. We have a 2 year old boy and a 4 year old boy. We are enjoying having the swivel wheel. It is hard to get through doors at the mall but can be done! Now I don't have to lift the whole stroller just to turn it! It works very well for walks. The storage space below is not huge but ample if you use wisely. It will not fit my large purse or my large diaper bag but I put purse and diaper stuff in a backpack for the Fair and was able to fit it in there as well as other items like coats, blankets, waters. It's just not very deep. I may need to write another review in a year to make sure all is still well!"
4,Instep jogger works great,We purchased this jogger to replace a rather nice double stroller from Graco. We found the jogger far less bulky and easier to push up hills etc. My kids like it and the baby fold down seat is great for naps. I wish it had a parent tray and child tray however. I feel like my kids are safe and this was a great buy!
4,Nice ! except........,"I love the swivel wheel , which is the main reason why I wanted this stroller. HOWEVER Its shade is not large enough to cover the children so I had to buy a seperate shade for the stroller. An added expense to the stroller."
1,The worst baby investment ever,"Do not think you can jog with this stroller and the back rests are very short. my 3 year old's head was completely over the top of the back of it, which would be fine if you could sit the seats up. They lean way back at their highest position.Here's the kicker! The wheel fell off and the stroller when tumbling forward and landed on the pavement on TOP OF MY CHILDREN WHOSE FACES GOT SCRAPED UP!!!! I WOULD NEVER EVER EVER recommend this stroller to my worst enemy. Save your money and get a BOB, even if it's just work walking.Oh and did I mention that the axle in the back is bent after only a year? And that the rickety clicking sound was there after a month and never went away? And that it's hammock style so that means the kids just lean into each other and get angry with one another? What a hideous investment."
1,Returned Stroller,"I originally had my heart set on the BOB but couldn't justify spending the money. After reading the reviews on this stroller, I decided to go with it because all of the reviews seemed positive. The first time I tried the stroller, the left side wobbled a lot and the front tire shook. After having several people look at it, they decided it was put together correctly and it shouldn't have that problem. Long story short, I ended up returning the stroller and got the BOB. The BOB is the best stroller I have ever owned and it is definitely worth the money!"
5,Love It,I bought this stroller for my 5 month old and 2 1/2 year old. We love it. The baby can recline and our older daughter can sit up at the same time. It pushes much easier than a regular double stroller and the swivel wheel makes it easy to go for walks in town. It even makes pushing a stroller up hill easy. I would buy it all over again. It's worth the money.
5,Great Stroller for the $$$...,"Firstly, I'll say that I'm a stroller fanatic... I've got 2 small children and we have had over 7 strollers in the past 2 years. I have top brands like Bugaboo. This In-Step stroller is by far the easiest, most practical stroller of all. With it's swivel wheel, I can manuver through crowded shopping malls and street fairs as well as run without feeling like I'm pushing a transfer truck. For the money, it's pretty unbelievable that you can get such a great product when most double joggers are over $250. I don't know why I waited so long to purchase this wonderful product. I love it!"
4,A stroller that serves its purpose,"The reason I bought this stroller was to be able to run whenever I felt like it. I have a 14 month old and a husband that works and runs himself, and I was tired of asking for a sitter to be able to go and run. I think the stroller is perfect for what it was meant for. However, we will not be able to take this stroller on a trip or anything because as of right now our vehicles are cars and it will not fit unless we take the wheels off and at that point I find it pointless. The wheel in the front is also a little wobbely when you don't have it locked which is a little annoying but other than that I really like it and it does the job I bought it for."
3,A pretty good stroller,I have to say I am enjoying this stroller so far. It fits both of my kids and handles like a dream with the swivel front wheel. There are some drawbacks....for one its heavy! I have a hard time putting it into my trunk and it doesn't really fold down very compactly. It BARELY fits in my trunk so make sure you have a large trunk to fit this in. Also the sun shield on this is worthless I had to buy the kiddopatamus brand attachment. Also not much cup holder storage for me so I also bought an extra attachment for that.
4,Good for the price,"This is a great stroller if you're looking for a reasonably priced jogging stroller. I love the swivel front wheel, the handy sack you attach for drinks, phone, keys. The only drawback is that it doesn't have room for storage or their toys and it doesn't provide shade. Overall, I would recommend this stroller."
4,Def just a Jogging Stroller,"I absolutely love this stroller for jogging, it is easy to maneuver and lightweight to push. However, going around town I was disappointed because I was unable to get through a single door by maybe an inch-very annoying. Also, it's kind of on the heavy bulky side and takes up the entire back of my SUV. As far as jogging with it is an awesome stroller that's why I gave it a four because that is the main reason for purchasing this one. For around the town though I am going to buy an inline stroller to fit in smaller areas (shopping aisles, single doors)."
3,Smooth ride but not great for tall kids,"I really was not expecting much for this amount of money and I am fine with it since it was really cheap, but there is no reason they could not have made the top bar and sun visor taller, I have to smoosh my 4 year old in there. He is fine with it so I am as well, but I will probably only get a year out of it before I can no longer smoosh him. The kids are also very close together and look pretty cramped. If I had paid more I would have been really honked off, but for $170 it is fine. The ride is super smooth and such a relief after trying to push them both around in the sit n stand. I am 5'9 and the push bar is pretty low, but I think it only really becomes a problem if you are a runner, for me its barely noticeable. Your not going to find any better for this money in my opinion."
4,"Good stroller, but not perfect","This stroller is easy to push, collapse, and set up, but the sun shade is really bad. It doesnt nearly shade any sun in any of the seats positions."
4,Love this stroller,"I bought this stroller for my 3 month old and my 17 month old.. I love it.. it pushes so easy I can do it with one hand... I only gave it a 4 because like other posters said, the canopy is really lacking.. you might as well not have it on there.. Also..the instructions were not so great.. they had diagrams that weren't included, and the pictures were all really dark.. and some of it was just plain confusing to read...luckily, it was pretty easy to put together anyway...But I use it almost ever day...I have an Impala and can not get it to fit into my trunk, so that was a little dissappointing as well..But over all I am SOOO glad I bought it..."
3,Some is good ... some isn't.,"For those who are looking for ""new"" information on Reiki, particularly about Tera Mai, this is a really good book.However, I found that Kathleen digressed in places (like, up to half the book) and started writing about much that seemed out of context and odd. I would have preferred to have those bits left out (you'll know them when you see them) and more on Reiki included instead."
1,"If I could give zero stars, I would","I read many, many books per year and, although I've read at least a dozen books on Reiki and even more on healing and energy work in general, this is by far the least helpful, most chaotically organized book I've ever read. I agree with another reviewer in saying Ms. Milner must have convince family and friends to review the book at 5 stars. It's a very difficult read. I do, however, sense that she is genuinely caring... just not a writer or teacher, as far as the book goes."
3,Why this rehash,I must agree with the previous reviewer in regard to this set. Why rehash what has already beeen done and quite well I might add. It would have been better if Warner Bros had re-mastered and issued some of the Berkely films which have yet to be issued on DVD. I can only say that this is fine for anyone who didn't but the first two set issues.
5,GREAT CLASSIC of the 30s,"This movie is great in that it shows what our culture was like in the 1930s-At the beginning of the film a very young Ginger Rogers does an amazing ""We're in the Money' and even does a whole verse in 'Pig-Latin'-who today even remembers talking like that?Great dance sequences-maybe considered somewhat hokey with all the kaleidescope effects-but after our country was just coming out of the great depression people needed stuff like this.Also a lot of work went into these musicals and they are simply worth it just for the costumes and art decco alone even if you don't like the plot."
3,An excellent primer on pre Green Bay Packers history,"As a serious football historian/researcher and writer I found this work to be a valuable addition to my personal library. It is concise, well researched and helps to clear up a lot of the gray area from the period leading up to the Packers joining the APFA/NFL in 1921.Any football(even the casual) fan will find it a worthy investment in time and a modest sum of money for a great lesson on the last of a very unique sports franchise."
1,Insanity is the only excuse to purchase this CD...,"Only a total lunatic could enjoy sitting through this disc...and the sound quality! Don't expect that this was recorded for anything other than the interviwer's personal use. And what's the deal with this being a picture disc? What CD doesn't have a picture on it? If it were vinyl they'd have something going but this is just stupid. About the only thing redeeming on this disc is the part where the thickly accented German interviewer (funny in itself) gets Ian going about his hair (Sonic Temple era long)...Ha, Ha, Ha. ""...long hair...it's quite natural for a man really."" I can just imagine him flipping his locks as he's saying this."
4,Yet Another Item Not as Described. However . . .,"This quilt is truly a beautifully made product. It is so soft and warm and does indeed have a very generous loft as the description states. It arrived with an original price of $170+ so the price Amazon is selling it for is awesome. The only thing I'm not happy about is that the quilt does not reverse to a striped pattern as stated. It reverses to a lighter blue solid color. Other than the initial dissapointment of the descrepency in the description, I would definitely buy this item again and recommend it to a friend."
1,Returned - made of Polyester,"It is made of cotton as the description implies.... on one side. The other side is scratchy, uncomfortable polyester, just like you would find in a $30 comforter from Walmart. That was just what I was trying to replace! I was looking for something soft, not a stuffy plastic blanket. And while the denim side is nice, I don't want to wake up with marks from the seams all over my face. Frankly, I'm confused as to how this got so many favorable reviews. The pattern on the comforter doesn't even match the description/picture. That doesn't matter to me much but I know that it might matter to others. I would have given this 0 stars but that wasn't an option."
5,Tommy Hilfiger Denim Comforter,This item was just as I expected. It wasn't too heavy or too light. A perfect compliment to my son's room.
5,Perfect for high school/college age guy,Got this for my son's dorm....is rugged and perfect for someone his age and looks perfect. Be aware that it is the DENIM COMFORTER ONLY....not all of the items in the picture.
4,Great for winter,"Not as heavy as I thought it would be, this comforter is perfect as winter bedding. (I expected a heavier denim weight). Spreads well directly from packaging."
1,deceptive picture,"Buyer beware, while the picture is this awesome patchwork comforter on top, it is not what you are ordering. It is an ALL DENIM BLUE comforter."
3,Not exactly accurate.....,"I own this CD, and first of all let me point out this fact for you, not only does this CD not have interviews by all members on it, but even though Freddie is featured on the cover, this interview is all by Brian May! So if you are looking for the spoken word by Freddie, look elsewhere. Not that this is a bad interview, the sound quality is excellant, and the informatioon is fairly interesting, if a bit dated (the interview on this disc was done prior to the release of their 1986 album ""A Kind Of Magic"")."
4,Want to know more about Freddie..?,"This disc features interviews about Queen members. If you want to know more about them, their music, with some anecdotes, just get this cd. But if you already have Queen documentary videos, you'll probably learn nothing more from here. Be careful as there is NO music on this cd."
2,Too many leaks,"I purchased this product for my son who still has a problem with wetting at night. These have leaked more often than not, and I still wind up doing more laundry. Not worth it."
4,For more advanced Latin aerobics dancers,"Carlos' DVD is ecellent and has more than one workout program so you can start off slow with the introduction and move into more advanced and complicated steps. I have tried it and will love it after I improve. Right now I am using Elise's Video to learn from.Can't wait to really learn Carlos' moves as it is a great workout and a lot of fun. I highly recommend it. I am spoiled with the great music my Latin teacher at the YMCA classes use. Have not been able to find a workout for home that compares with her music. The music Carlos uses is okay, better than just drums."
3,Beware of your camera model,"Please be very cautious when buying this model of smartmedia reader. It's not compatible with the Polaroid PDC-640. The camera cannot read the cards after inserted into this reader. I asked polaroid about this matter and they confirmed it.I'm not saying this reader is bad, but cards came useless **for the camera** if you once try to read them with this."
3,"Not for a new reader, but...","I enjoyed this book, but I think it could have been told better as a short story or novella. The basic plot is good, and the implications for the fate of the universe really got me going, but the plot tends to drag, and the characters go in circles, not accomplishing much. Mind you, I think it's pretty apparent from the writing that this was intended: fairly thin characters serving to introduce the reader to an interesting situation (and not even explaining it, necessarily). Overall, however, I don't think that this style would appeal to first-time readers, and I can understand why some don't get into his works."
4,Blind but Sherlock Holmesy,The blind judge has remarkable insight. You'd swear he could see. Murder and mayhem does not win in his court. Seventeen hundreds London is easy to imagine when Bruce Alexander is at the helm. I feel like I'm standing on the corner waiting for the hackney to take me to the Magdalene Home for Penitent Prostitutes to help reform the girls. It all comes to life in this book and you can enjoy a bit of history.
1,Maybe others,This product might fit other XBox 360's but not a first generation. I will not plug into the power supply block. Bummer...
3,Not as big as the listing says,"The description for this bank says that it is 16.1 x 3 x 6 inches. This is completely inaccurate. It is 5.5(L) x 1.5(W) x 3(H) inches. Clearly this is a lot smaller than what I thought I was getting. It is good quality and I am keeping it, but I was rather shocked to find that it was more then 2/3 shorter then what I expected."
1,Very tiny bank....may hold $1.00 in change at most!,I was grossly disappointed with the small size of this product and wish I had read others' reviews before ordering. I am returning the bank because it is no where near the 16.1 inches it boasts in the description. I bought it for my 3 year nephew who surely will have more change than this can hold. It is beautiful and would be a nicer gift for a newborn. No doubt it is high quality and lovely to look while not being something easily broken. If they could just make a bigger version I would reorder it!
1,misleading,The product details/description states that the train dimensions are 16.1x however wide and however tall...I was under the impression that I had purchased a much larger train than I had received. Very disappointing.
1,Cheap item,"I bought this to get Kim Carnes ""I saw three ships"", but all I found was a ridiculous Karaoke DVD with cheap made music. The Christmas CD iself is a non-appropriate mixing of songs. Stay away from this item!"
2,"Good story, poor research","The writing here is good, but the research is nonexistent. The author has the Prince and Princess of Wales estranged four years before their wedding, the hero visiting the court of Czar Alexander four years before he took the throne, and the villain using chloroform, which was some fifty years in the future. Ten minutes' worth of research could have solved this."
1,Don't waste your time,This is very disappointing for me to write because for the most part I have enjoyed Jane Feather novels. There's maybe one or two that I quit midway through but this one I stopped after Chapter 6. This had to be the dullest book ever! I won't bore you with details because basically it puts me to sleep just thinking about it.Don't waste your money.
2,It gave me the creeps,"If this book was judged on the implementation of historical facts, it would receive 5 stars. However as a historical romance it only receives 2 stars. First of all I realize that older men married teenagers in this time period, and in other books the age gap is glossed over. In this book it was not the case. It was reiterated multiple times that Justin was 17 years older than Danielle. That in and of its self would not have bothered me, but Justin kept referring to her as a child even after they were married. The whole thing just gave me the creeps.Now if you looked passed the age thing the story was choppy at best. There were like three distinct stories, and they didn't seem to flow very well. In the last third of the book she introduced a character that was seeking unholy retribution for acts Justin's father committed, and then she didn't even explain it that well. What was that?There was a good book buried in the nonsense, about 200 pages needed to be chopped out."
1,I'd rather read the original Heyer.,"If I wanted to read Georgette Heyer's wonderful These Old Shades, I'd go and read the original, not this pale imitation. In These Old Shades, Justin, the Duke of Avon, is in Paris and rescues a waif called Leon. He subsequently discovers that Leon is in fact Leonie, a girl in disguise, and there is a mystery as to Leonie's identity. There is, of course - knowing Heyer - a very sweet romance as well as a well-plotted mystery story.Sound familiar at all? Have other reviewers not read Heyer's book? My recommendation: forget about Love's Charade and go and read These Old Shades. You won't regret it!"
3,"Armsbendback ""Waiting Room""","I heard good things about Armsbendback's album, ""Waiting Room,"" but i wasn't particularly impressed. The singer (or whoever it is that screams) screaming voice isn't great, and the songs themselves are nothing to rave about. The music and lyrics aren't bad, they just don't seem too original.This is not a horrible cd, however, and is worth checking out if you're into the new screamo style. It's not exactly hardcore, but not too soft.Rating: Three stars."
1,Very poor,"This is a typicl example of a poor level of production in an AP review book. The practice tests are neither accurate simulations of real AP tests or reflections of the AP curriculum. I found most of the questions easier than real AP questions, and many questions supplied formulas or hints that would never appear on a real test, thus spoiling the opportunity to gauge what you need to review. Review materials themselves are disorganized and too brief to be worth reviewing (anyone who doen't already know whats in this book shouldn't be taking the test.) The ""Red Alert"" study plan can be summarized as ""read two chapters of this book a week, and then take some practice tests.""Not recommended at all."
4,Great Gift for my Kids,Kids simply loved this little fellow.I do find the size of the smurf a bit small.Overall good quality toy
5,"This is the real story of the helicopter war, folks...","For the past thirty some odd years, America has been innundated with movies and books presenting a lot of hype and misinformation about the war in Viet Nam. Outlaws In Viet Nam is the one book to come along that takes you straight to the heart and soul of what it was really like belonging to this unique military outfit. Ride the Mekong Delta in Dave Eastman's helicopter and you will gain a sense of the close-knit nature of this aviation group. He leaves nothing out in his effort to give you some keen insight into the special bonding that holds this group together, even today, as the Outlaws prepare for their bi-annual reunion to be held in San Antonio, Texas in October 2002. How do I know that this is the real stuff? I was there in Vinh Long...and after 36 years, it still brings tears to my eyes."
4,The thoughts of named places brought back memories.,"I don't know how I ended up in this under 13 review, but here it is. The thought came to me as I read OUTLAWS in Vietnam , that I didn't know what the pilots were doing and feeling when landing and taking-off from areas that most people will never experiance. As a door gunner I remember thinking how we would work together giving instruction from our gunner wells on the position of the helicopter in relation to the surounding trees, brush, and mountain cliffs that we used as a landing zone (LZ), I often thought ""that was scarry"" when we did this type of landing. Dave wrote this book from a pilots view and I did enjoy the memories. He also gave some credit to the crew that flew with him. Fine book Dave, I'm glad I bought it. Tony Villarruel Outlaw (Door Gunner) 26, 1971-72"
5,Peepn Floats,"My grandgaughter who is 10 months old, loves all the Peep's movies. She even takes it in the car when Mom has to run errands on her small laptop dvd player. We have bought her 5 of the movies and she loves them all. It's a great babysitter for Mom"
2,The Last Fairy Tale of Fantasy from the Vietnam War,"This well written, but poorly researched fantasy piece should have been labeled as a novel in my opinion. Ten POWS died of starvation, mistreatment, and torture in Garwood's camp; none of them crossed over to the enemy. To know the real Bobby Garwood, read Frank Anton's ""Why Didn't You Get Me Out?"" or Zalin Grant's ""Survivors,"" plus several more POW narratives that are out of print but still may be found at major libraries. If you are still inclined to believe the best in Garwood, look up his name or ""Garwood Papers"" on the POW/MIA Database on the Library of Congress's website, and you'll discover a ton of material that will change your mind"
2,The whole truth IS NOT TOLD in this book,"There is a lot of truth brought out in this book, but there are MANY unanswered questions concerning incidents involving Robert Garwood that occurred in the death camps of South Vietnam. These questions have been addressed by the men that suffered through horrible starvation, lack of medical treatment, and slave labor while Robert Garwood lived in relative comfort. Our government did not make up the horror stories that these men recounted in the court martial of Garwood. Garwood may have been a victim, but he took advantage of his position to the detriment of his fellow Americans..."
1,I couldnt even finish this book,"The total lack of actual historical facts, and the obvious lack of research made me put this book away before I got halfway through it. If you want to read something by an author who is obviously just talking about her opinion and is under Bobby Garwood's spell, enjoy. Otherwise, dont waste your time."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I have been a long-time, satisfied customer with Amazon and have never had an issue with anything I've ever ordered...Until now. I ordered this pet bed via Amazon from Splintek. Based on the measurements, I ordered the medium. It turns out that I needed a bigger size. In the meantime, I found a comparable bed that was 50% cheaper than the Splintek's large. JUST KNOW THAT IF YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT, ALL SALES ARE FINAL!! I didn't see that stated anywhere obvious on the Amazon site when I made my purchase. Needless to say, I'm not going to go out and buy the less costly bed now. Not only that, but when I called Splintek about at least exchanging the medium for the large bed, I was told that their Customer Service would call me back a couple of days. Well that deadline has come and gone and I haven't heard a peep. I am very unhappy and dissatified with this whole experience. The product itself seems fine. It's the nightmare of the the third-party seller that you have to worry about!"
1,"Mine's Spanish, too!!",I just got mine today and it's in Spanish too! That wouldn't be a bad thing if we understood the language!! :) Other than that I think it would be a very cute toy.
3,Good Book,This is a well written book that gives refreshing knowlege in a delightful way. This book appeals to anyone who is interested in human emotions and enjoys reading. Dr. Dostor has written a book with great illustrations that blue and white collar workers can relate to. Good Book.
5,What can I say?,"It's Genesis. Now, I happen to be a Genesis fan who adores the ground they walk on. (Or more to the point, the ground Phil Collins walks on). This CD is for the collectors, or for major fans of Genesis or Phil Collins. Or for the Music buff. The content is an interveiw with Genesis, and it tells about their history, and stuff that most Genesis fans know already. But it reveals some interesting new ideas on the songs and how they came to be, which made the whole CD worth it to me. Besides, it's always fun to hear Phil's voice, isn't it? For the Genesis fan."
3,Interesting Interview,"This interview is from 1986 and features Phil Collins and Tony Banks. It is just before the release of Invisible Touch and is fairly interesting, probably only to hardcore Genesis fans. They talk about touring, playing in large arenas, reviews, and a little about the compositions on the Invisible Touch album. Strangely absent is Mike Rutherford; he isn't present during the interview. However, it is still a nice addition to your Genesis collection."
5,Nicky Gumbels Searching Issues Review,I found the book short and to the point. This book was used in a religious class at my church between church services. A chapter was done each week for seven weeks with discussion that folowed. A very good book to help answer some questions about christinanity.
1,Poisonous book,"Whatever good you feel has been done by the Alpha course, Mr. Gumbel demonstrates in this book his poisonous homophobia. I was recommended this book in the mid-90s and was shocked to read it. I am afraid that people who have been inspired by Alpha will pick up this book and believe it is all right to be mean-spirited and prejudiced against people because of their sexual orientation, since that is what Mr. Gumbel expounds on here. Shame on him. This is not what the world needs."
1,The Perfect Horrible Example,"This is a movie for everyone who teaches filmmaking. Forget GWTW and Casablanca. Dr. Otto is a movie that looks like it was made by squirrels.Every student should see this. It is perfectly AWFUL! Which is why it should live. There is hardly a frame or a word of this movie that works. It is a textbook of cinematic error.Now and then you are fixated by Jim Varney, because you know there was something in there but it would not come out until later movies. Jim was cast against type and it is just a pain to see him working so hard to go in the wrong direction.Nevertheless, the years have shown that Cherry and crew learned a bunch and went on to make some of the funniest movies around.In some ways it is reminiscent of Alan Ormsby's horror classic, which was like getting hit with water balloons while standing on one foot and reciting lines from Pogo. Perhaps this is the primordial soup from which is made, in time, good comedy.I threw my copy out."
3,Same Tiresome Characters Except,"Well, another movie with a cognitively challenged central character; Eastern European mafia antagonists; teen prostitute changes-her-life around savior; and of course good & bad cops. Up until the final minutes the story seemed to flow as a bit of entertaining and slightly plausible storytelling (well except for the hero's accoutrements) but the final 1/4 hour seemed to fall apart with no direction and the pacing seemed strained as the director seemed to be having problems maintaining the story's earlier energy. Woody's performance (although again typecast) in recent film roles is starting to show a larger range of expression and commitment to an understanding of his character."
4,A Good Drama.,"It is a drama, not a comedy or a super-hero movie. However, super-hero elements are inserted into the script, lessening the value of a very good drama. As example, the main character has the ability to come and go as he pleases, hardly been noticed when entering or exiting even a police station. The ending is also a super-hero insert. However, the whole movie is a good drama. I was surprised by the great acting, specially from Woody, a comedy-type character."
3,Mixed Feelings,"This movie wasn't too bad...worth a watch, but probably not much more in my opinion. Woody Harrelson was really good in this and it was pretty good overall, but it seemed a little lacking somehow, plus it was depressing in the end...I hate depressing movies. It was a good one time watch though. Just my own opinion though, judge for yourself."
4,Glad I decided to watch this movie,"Wasn't sure about watching this movie at first. but am so glad I did. One of the best I've seen in awhile. It's funny, sad and heart-warming, all at the same time. Woody Harrelson does such a good job playing Defendor! Very well cast movie."
3,"Enjoyable, Funny, with a Touching End","An under the radar film with a lot going for it but not enough to keep it totally afloat. Woody plays a mentally challenged man who sees himself as a caped vigilante. Many of his efforts are comical, but its not a comedy. His genuine desire to do good and his naive and askew understanding of the world makes him an unlikely but likeable hero. He rescues a damsel, thwarts crooked cops, and in the end makes a difference."
2,This movie is pretty terrible,"I very badly wanted to like this movie. It had all the makings of a great flick which could have been on par with kickass. A delusional super hero, wasp grenades, and Woody Harrelson to boot. Sadly, the defendor, just didn't get there as a movie. It wasn't really a comedy and it was pretty sappy as a drama. I think if the script writer had dreamnt up a few more gadgets like the wasp grenade and gone after the kickass type angle this would have been a brilliant film. Among the few words of praise I can give to this movie go to Woody in that atleast he didn't go full retard. Some women may score this film a star or so higher depending on how well they enjoy the gratuitous shot of Woody's ass."
2,Defendor - A psychological goofy movie,"The DVD arrived in the advertised condition with no marks, blemishes or skips.I'm sorry, but I felt this was nothing but a dumb attempt at trying to understand the psychotic mind, and far, far beneath Woody Harrelson's acting ability. A thoroughly rotten movie."
3,Woody Keeps It Real...or Surreal,"Despite appearances, Defendor (as one reviewer points out) isn't a comedy. It's a character study of a mentally impaired would-be costumed vigilante played by Woody Harrelson trying to right wrongs in his world. Defendor has more in common with films like ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" or ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" or ""Lars and the Real Girl"" - but doesn't quite come close to those films.Fans of Woody should enjoy this, and the film is well casted, acted and well filmed. Great lighting cinematography makes this worthwhile. The story doesn't really raise the stakes as it could, and plods a little - when it should fly. Overall it's watchable but don't expect to hang on to your seats. And don't rent or buy this for your kids - they won't get it...Still, a good effort for a reportedly $ 4 million flick.4 stars for the camera and lighting. 3.5 stars for the story..."
4,Defendor movie review,"Defendor was not the movie I was expecting. If you think this will be a light hearted, shallow, superhero, or uplifting movie, it is not. It's certainly wasn't what I expected from the title, box cover, or cast. But that is not to say it was a bad movie. It was actually quite good, albiet somewhat depressing. But any movie that can pull emotions out of you (Even if it is depression), is the mark of a good movie. Bad movies just seem to pull apathy out of me, which technically I'm not sure is an emotion.In short if you're not in the mood for a serious drama, pick another movie. But if your entertainment taste includes that genra, this is a good film."
3,Excellent Kindle formatting. Not enough action.,"Jake Grafton's search for four nukes sold to Muslim terrorists ends at the Statue of Liberty. Good sgtory, but not that much action (Jake directs it and does not engage in it).Excellent Kindle formatting."
3,Ending by Remo Williams,"For a while this one has a good hook. Then about 3/5's of the way thru, it seems a great deal of detail disappears and we get conclusions rather than detection. The ending appears tacked on only for the action potential. Damn, it had me for a time."
4,Liberty,I am a newcomer to Steven Coonts. He is an excellent author. Anyone who is a spy novel buff will love these books.
1,Not believable. Not thrilling.,"I usually enjoy this kind of book (but have not read prior books by this author), but not this one. The plot is not believable. The characters are boring. The author appears to have made zero effort to research the background information (medical details, physics of nuclear bomb detection, computer security, etc.) so it all seems lame. It's not even well written. It is supposed to be a page-turner, but it seems like a chore to read. It is supposed to be a thriller, but after reading half, I really don't care what happens next. I won't bother to finish it."
4,Terrorists and nukes,"This is a fairly predictable post-911 book: Islamic Terrorists smuggle nukes into the country and get ready to light them off. WHile we all know Jake Grafton and company is going to stop the horrific from occurring, this book is better written than most attempts at similar story lines.Mr. Coonts throws in a couple of red herrings and false leads. There is a lot going on in this book and a couple of things that makes one wonder how close we came to nuclear immolation during the Cold War.This is an enjoyable, afternoon and/or beach read."
