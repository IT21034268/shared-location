2,Too difficult to remove,"The instructions did not state the proper application of this product. I panicked when I could not remove it after applying it. I got a bottle of my Meguiars Final Inspection Detailer, added it to my microfiber towel and was able to remove it. Reading these reviews, it makes the product seem worthy, however, I am not going to try it again anytime soon."
4,Very good product. Lived up to expectations,"this product performed AWESOMELY on my 2011 white F250 pickup. The only thing i didn't like is how it performed on the chrome. I'd like to see a disclaimer about that. But on the finish, again, AWESOME!"
2,to difficult.,Its to easy to streak this stuff on. Yes I am sure you pro's dont streak when using it. I am average user so sorry.
2,KYB Gas-a-just review,"Shocks came in 3 days - excellent. They were rear shocks for my 87 Jetta. Price was excellent and I'm sure I got what I paid for, that said, they pale in a performance comparison to my 93 Golf's Bilstein HD's. I was hoping for better. They make a decent OEM replacement, however."
1,Poor quality control,"One included screw was a different size and it split one of the MDF uprights down about 3 inches. Wood Technology told me I must have overtightened it, that they only use one size of screw. So it was MY mistake and not their screw supplier making a mistake. I used a manual screwdriver and definitely did not overdue it. MDF is unforgiving in cross section and I was careful about using any force. I had checked all the pieces and tossed the box before assembly so returning it became an issue. I ended up having to cut down all four uprights to be able to use them at all. I need stands for two other pairs and will be buying a different brand."
2,"Not really worth $33, let alone MSRP of $60","It's an extremely simple item to construct. Took me all of five minutes.But in those five minutes, I noted numerous imperfections in the cheap finish, as well as nicks and chips that shouldn't be there if this is the ""high quality"" fiber-wood they say it is. I touched it up with Sharpie, so it'll do. They are a good size and fit for my setup. I might end up painting over them and giving them a lacquer finish.All in all, I wouldn't recommend these. I've seen high school wood shop students build nicer stands."
2,Horrible Tasting Coffee,"I've had this unit for a number of years and while I haven't had any reliablity issues with it, it simply does not make a good cup of coffee. I've tried completely disassembling it and meticulously cleaning every part, run gallons of vinegar through it, tried every kind of filter under the sun etc., but can't get a cup of java that even comes close to the local McDonald's.Plus it's difficult to use. The fill marks inside the water reservoir are impossible to see without a flashlight (I do not exaggerate) and the pot is impossible to pour from without spillage. As I mentioned earler, I have had plenty of practice cleaning this unit and can honestly say that it doesn't get easier over time. The aforementioned resrvoir has tons of little knooks and crannies that are difficult to reach with any hands larger than those of a five year old girl.On the plus side...well, I can't think of a plus side at the moment. Maybe I'll have something better to say after I get a cup of Starbucks."
3,Good value for the money,"This coffee maker is an excellent choice if you want to make both espresso and regular coffee and are willing to sacrifice a bit. The espresso will lack the crema you get with a large much more expensive machine, but does provide a good alternative. For the money you can't beat it."
1,What a Pain,"The machine is tempremental at best - it would not use my preferred pre-ground expresso. But it worked ok with ground beans a bit more course. Then, I broke my glass coffee carafe - my fault, I'll buy a replacement. Replacements do not come with lids. As the lid was attached to the broken glass, I had thrown it away. Krups will sell a replacement lid, but won't have it in for a month or so. Machine does not work without the lid. I have used Krups machines for 15+ years - never again. My $ is going towards a new Mr. Coffee."
1,Short lifespan,"I purchased this product as a gift for a friend. I am sorry to report that the espresso maker has effectively ceased working after less than two years, and it was not used every day. While the coffee maker side continues to work adequately, I could have spent far less if all I wanted to get was a decent regular coffee maker. For this price I expect a longer service life."
2,Coffee Lover,"Great concept , but built very cheaply. The plastic bent as I locked the expresso filter in place. Returned it after one use. After more research it seems better to buy separate products."
2,There must be better...,"I have had this machine for a couple of years and am about to replace it. It is not very well built--have had to replace a couple of parts and THIS IS A NIGHTMARE! Everything at Krups is backordered--I waited 4 months for a part and finally ordered it in another color from another place. 8 months later, still no word from Krups! Other than that, just minor complaints. The yield from the coffee maker is low and it is slow. I figure there must be better machines out there and definitely better customer service."
2,Decent coffee - forget about the espresso/cappuccino,"I received this machine nearly 4 years ago as a wedding gift. Over time, I have made many pots of decent coffee. I generally make enough for one travel mug in the mornings. I have tried, unsuccessfully, to make cappuccino but have never been able to get the frother to work properly. I have to admit, there is an excessive amount of steam released when brewing. Enough to make me concerned for my cabinets. And, since I've never been successful with the espresso/frother side of the machine, I'm now wishing I had registered for something different."
1,Fake espresso maker,"There is no pressure in the espresso maker. It just steams water through. It's kinda like drip coffee, but bitter."
1,already broken.,We've had this for four weeks and it's already broken. The handle on the espresso side (plastic) just snaspped off one day. Plus it makes bad espresso. Save your money and buy a stove-top maker.
3,Beginner machine,"It seems like any time you cram multiple units together, quality suffers. This is no exception. I have owned this unit for about 4 years. I have never had a problem with it, while using it daily. But.....a quality cup of espresso will never happen. Crema is non existant! Unless you make the full carafe of espresso, it will only come out luke warm. I have pre-heated cups to help a bit, but still is only warm. I use Illy, Starbucks, and Passalaqua with different grinds and tamps with no improvement.The steamer works great. The coffee machine gets 95% of my daily use. It is slow, but makes a better cup than Starbucks does. Because of this, I have not up graded yet. All in all, you get good coffee maker and a poor espresso maker. What do you expect for under $100. Right?"
4,3 years old and still going strong,"I've had my Il Caffe Duomo for over 3 years, and I'm quite happy with it. The machine is definitely near the top in terms of price/performance. I use it mostly for espresso, but I also brew coffee on occassion. The only problem I've had is that I had to recently replace the cap for the boiler chamber, as it cracked, but I can definitely deal with a $5 replacement part over several years of service. It's imporrant to keep the machine clean, especially after steaming milk, or it can get yucky."
5,Replacement carafe needed,"We have had this machine for ten years and has worked perfectly, my problem right now is that I need a replacement carafe for the coffee part. If anyone knows where I can get a replacement carafe can you let me know? I tried the ""universal"" kind and it is too tall. I really like the machine, it makes great coffee and espresso, and the frother works well too."
4,"Good, durable, flexible","I've had this device for 14 years. I've repaired a couple small things, like the mechanism to allow the coffeepot to be removed during the drip process without spilling coffee onto the hotplate, and running a decalcification solution through the espresso side. But otherwise both coffee and espresso functions continue to work flawlessly.My only complaints are that the espresso carafe is basically unnecessary, it doesn't make quite as much espresso as one might like, and that the plastic isn't labelled as being BPA-free (though this is an older model before ""plastic consciousness"").I've now moved to a french press (Bodum) for coffee so that I'm not running hot water through plastic, but I could also use the espresso function as the water and cofee only touch steel."
5,I LOVE my Krups!!,"Thank you for reading my review! I bought my Krups over a couple years ago at a YARD SALE for FIVE BUCKS! What a PICK! Of course being from a yard sale I had to find manuals and sorts to figure it out, and after trial and error on Espresso and getting the parts list I figured out there were a couple critical parts missing, AKA the steam plug and espresso pot and such. I got all the needed items from Krups right away and WALLA, I became a Krups expert and just LOVE my investment into making this machine a winner in our house!! WE LOVE IT THANKS ROBERT I USE IT EVERYDAY for coffee and cappuccino on the weekends the BEST! Probably will never get a better yard sale deal ever!"
3,not quite like cappuccino in Florence,"The coffee maker and the expresso maker produces excellent results, but the latte component is problematic. The pressure from the steam maker does not last long enough to heat the milk sufficiently; also the amount of foam produced is inconsistent."
5,It's really good,"I really am happy with my Krups coffee maker. Either I make expressos or capucchinos (actually I prefer lattes), my Krups has worked perfectly in the two months I've had it. Certainly was tricky to use the froth for foam, but if you read carefully the instructions you will get the hang of it (and of course, with some practice). I recognize I'm not a heavy coffee drinker and I don't expect either that the machine will work like I was in some fancy coffee shop. This is an easy-to-use home appliance to make a slightly better cup of coffee than the average coffee maker machines. If some people are too demanding and specific with their coffee needs and expectations, I suggest strongly not buying this appliance or any other for that matter, because they will always have complains that will be impossible to accomplish."
3,"Decent, but spend a little more","Decent machine b/c it lasted 4 years of regular use. Now that I know a little more however, go with a pump and boiler type machine. This one never seemed to get the water hot enough to extract the quality flavour I really enjoy..."
5,Ordered these for a friend and they were not what she wanted so I kept them. I think they are great!,Great for occasional leakage. Soft and comfortable. I won't need to order more for quite some time as these were ordered for a friend of mine and she decided not to buy them from me.
5,Strings that fit like a favorite pair of slippers,"I started using Tapewound bass strings on my fretless,over twenty years ago and have never found a reason to change. I soon put a set on my fretted instrument too. I tend toward walking lines and the tapewounds project a smooth mellow sound. They never cause string noise when I slide. They are easy to keep clean. Easy on the fingers and easy on my guitars; they require less tension than other strings I have used. They would not be my choice for hard rock or slapping but they please me for blues and jazz oriented tunes. And they seem to wear forever."
5,Great story,A well-written story about an ordinary guy caught up in an extraordinary situation.The book was hard to put down! Recommended reading for everyone! Would make a great movie.
5,Nice Quick Read,This is a good book worth reading. It's a very quick read which is nice sometimes. Story told in a very straight forward way. Amazing this guys attitude during his captivity. I would have been freaking out! Buy the book. It's worth it.
3,Kidnapped in Iraq - Thomas Hamill,Provides an understanding of how one may survive a kidnap event when kidnapped by an extremist organization and/or common kidnap group or gang.
5,A must read !!!,This story is truly incredible and what is more incredible is how Thomas Hamill's faith allowed him to survive this ordeal and return to his family. The book is an easy read and stays intriguing throughout. You will not be disappointed. What an ordeal.
4,CD Copyright Sercurity Tightens,Firstly this box set is great value for money and has more tracks than the Verve complete metal box 3 cd set with similar good sound quality for the period. So feel confident that Definitive Records have done a good job here.Interestingly one of the disc's in this set does not play on my home stereo but plays fine on my laptop computer. I recently had a similar issue with one disc from the Mingus Atlantic box set. At first I thought I was getting faulty manufactured disc's but after reading another Amazon reviews comments I am sure this is a cd copyright sercurity issue. Let's hope this issue resolves itself over time.Back to the Parker box set. It's on a cheap label but the quality is all there. Buy and enjoy!
4,Interesting,"This book is very interesting and infromative, but the authors should take note that not everyody lives in New York. In fact, most Americans don't. You wouldn't know it though, because at least every chapter has an inside joke for New Yorkers. I don't care about the best way to JFK, a record time to Laguardia, or why I won't feel overdressed upstate, because I don't plan on going there. But I guess if you live in New York, the world revolves around New York wit."
2,Don't bother,"Hal Rubenstein has a very definite opinion about the issues that he writes about in this book; unfortunately, his opinion is frequently complete rubbish. I'm sorry, but some paisleys go with some things, black jeans are not appropriate in every situation, and an incredibly expensive suit from the trendy designer du jour is rarely a man's best bet. Furthermore, I resent the tone with which this book is written: having a penis does not make me clueless about dressing well and grooming myself, and Rubenstein's unstated assumption that it does and that I need help from the Arbiter of Tasteful and Taseless is offensive."
2,Sarcasm goes with Nothing,"Sharp wit and shrewd insight, yes. But why does H.R. have to be so sarcastic? Well, we all know. Some authors just have to do that. Anyway, thanks for the laughs."
1,upset,"Very poor instructions as to connections. As a novice, I would require instructions as to the proper connections for my situation. As for now, the unit is in my unusable cabinet along with other porely designed instructions. I hope more understandable instructions are available so that I may use this unit as intended."
1,Terrible,Very disappointed the facts don't check. About the only good thing was that Keith Idema was in jail when this book went to press and he could not get his hands on it.
1,Robin Moore - a once great author - has lost it,"As a 20+ year career Army Special Operations officer, I have long known of and revered Robin Moore and his famous 1965 tome, ""The Green Berets."" Thirty-nine years, however, is a long time and Robin Moore has in those intervening years, if this work is any indication, lost all the writing skills he once so abundantly possessed. With sentences like, "" . . . pilots flew . . . totally blacked out, with no lights at all, . . ."" is it any wonder that I am under-whelmed?The book is not only poor but poorly written. Save your money or spend it on another book, hopefully one that is well written, because you won't find much of value or interest here.Hint to Robin: take it back to the hooch, pour yourself a toddy, put your feet up, sit for a spell, and contemplate retirement . . . 'cuz you sure can't write anymore!!!"
5,Real War Stories,It is truly amazing for Mr. Moore to have traveled to Iraq to capture the real stories of those soliders that fought and continue to fight in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. A true non-fiction account of war.
2,False title....,"After reading this book, I was glad that I saved the old copies of Newsweek and Time magazines that covered the deaths of Saddam's sons and captured of Saddam himself. These old news magazines had far greater details on those subjects then this book.What does this book contained? Mostly selective special forces operations in Iraq that may be indirectly links to Saddam. These stories were well told and nicely written by an author who obviously enjoyed telling it. However, the author seem to put a rush job on the book since some of the writing seem to be bit hasty, if not little sloppy for a person of author's experiences. Also, the book have very little to do with the title and details about Saddam's capture proves to be weak and uninformative since it been told in greater details already by news magazines.If the book were ever to be rerelease some day, I hope it comes out with a different title instead of the misleading one that it has right now."
1,Where's the Beef?,"It's hard to imagine a book being flowery and dry at the same time, but Hunting Down Saddam is just that. Missing are first hand accounts, details, personal stories, anything that could liven the text and make interesting events, interesting; instead we get lines like, ""The SF medics dressed wounds, water was chugged, and faces were stuffed. All this fighting burned calories!"" Yep, that's about as detailed and interesting as this book gets.Honestly, I think anyone with an enthusiast knowledge of Special Operations, who watched CNN, could crank out propaganda superior to Hunting Down Saddam. Robin Moore takes us for a ride, but it's not to war."
2,Dissappointed Vet,"I will have to agree with the rest of the reviews on this book. I am an OIF vet and was with one of the units mentioned in this book. Yes, I did take part in the capture of Saddam. Therefore, I was very surprised with some of the inaccuracies. The author has put out some good stuff in the past but I must admit that I was quite unimpressed here. If you are interested in the hunt and capture of Saddam, there is a DVD documentary out called ACE IN THE HOLE put out by the Military Channel. It's a good source and has some scenes of the raid...and I'M even in it. Ha,ha. Seriously though, save your money and get the video instead."
1,Avoid this film like the plague,"In some sort of time warp between the 80s and 90s, Merlin decides that he should bring magic back and in the process wreaks havoc on an unsuspecting world. People turn into babies, normal people are forced perform exorcisms, pets die at a disproportionate rate, and Merlin can't be bothered with any of the pain he is causing because he has to find his pet killing demon monkey doll. This movie is pure, unabashed, unfiltered evil. Merlin is neither whimsical nor endearing as he blindly destroys the lives of all he encounters in a vaguely Canadian Northern Californian city. Under no cirsumstnaces ever watch this ""fun-filed, action packed family"" movie unless you enjoy having your soul torn out and tread heavily upon."
4,Sailing... and other horrors!,Sad and twisted tale of the agony of incompatibility. As well as the horrors of sailing with someone who doesn't give you the heart space to float his boat. Read it!
5,Woohoo!,"I originally ordered this for my girlfriend's birthday but i wasn't able to wait that long. I opened it up when it first arrived. At first i was unsatisfied since it had looked cloudy. Thinking I had failed I simply left it by the window and went to workout. Two hours later I was ready to pack it up and return it when I had actually noticed the diamonds were radiating and the corals itself make an impression on you. (I myself put it on since we have similar finger sizes) All I can say was, the reaction on her face was speechless. I was scared but then reassured as she leaped to my arms. Woohoo! oh yeah! free gift, bracelet? Why not!"
4,Coral 18K ring from Palm Beach Jewelry,"This ring was provided in its own box, with a beautiful free necklace and polishing cloth given by Palm Beach Jewelry. The ring itself is beautiful, and well made. It is delicate, yet strong in balance tone, color of stones and the arrangement is great. I would buy this item again from this location."
3,Nice But too small,"It is nice ring with same color in picture . size is ok , but looks too small on the hand. even looks large in the picture .I thought it's bigger on hand.thanks"
1,How did this get published??,Fasulo has written a horribly biased book on the UN with no real sources...just a couple of friends she quotes over a hundred times each. Fasulo missed a great opportunity to write a truly honest study on the United Nations. Her lack of world history is also very disappointing to read...
5,They Get It!,"After nearly 30 years in the marketing business, I am delighted to find two dynamic thinkers who have written compelling, concise and creative content on the needs of this country's most powerful and influencial market. Too long overlooked, women have different priorities, values, communication styles and preferences than men consumers. Learned and Johnson aptly address key differences, important nuances and critical factors that drive decision making, the customer experience and brand loyalty by giving actionable strategies for gaining women's trust and turning them into true brand advocates. Don't Think Pink is an easy read business book, dotted with personality and fun. If you want to train your brain to think differently about the women's market (not to mention grow your bottomline), but hate to be weighted down by the business-speak in a typicial business book, Don't Think Pink is for you."
3,BNC and RCA connectors are good---wiring gauge too small and fragile.,"Wiring is too small of a gauge and is very hard to work with and easily damaged during installation, so I suggest that you buy extra sets."
1,Wiring Kit,Returned this item because I didn't need it. Wiring a home for video surveillance was much more difficult than I anticipated.
5,Great product,I like these cords better than the originals that came with my system. They are flexible and didn't become rock hard in the cold while installing.
4,Good product/good price,"Good product so far. As advertised, however the only negative it did no come with connectors. I was extending the wire, as a result had to drive 50 miles round trip to Radio Shack, and a major inconvenience. Does not take away from product but if not included, it should have been noted and suggested as an add on item."
5,"Great Extender Cable,..for a Great Price!!","Works Great with the CCTV Camera I baught,...gets the job done!,...and come's w/ RCA Adapters for hooking up to Composit Video Input,..or w/o the adpter for Standard Security DVR Connections.Good Deal!"
3,Not very high quality,"I had to hard wire the power part of this cable to my spot monitor, as it came with leads only -- no plug. So I cut off the plug from the cable and stripped down the wires. I was surprised that the neutral wire had no sheathing inside the main covering. Most Siamese wiring I've worked with, both bulk and pre-cut, the inner power wires are both covered with their own insulation. On this one it's just the hot lead. The neutral is bare wire. Also, I had a heck of a time with the BNC connection to my DVR. I think the plug may have had a slight flaw in it's manufacturing, which made it nearly impossible to attach. I finally accomplished it with the help of some pliers. Once attached, the video signal is good, though, so it's functionally fine. I never had either of these problems with the Swann cables I've purchased in the past. Next time I'll go back to Swann."
2,Cable for camera,"I bought this cable to go on a ganz camera. It was shipped fast, Packed well, and looked good. Went to install it on the camera and it seemed like the plugs went together sloppy. Just didn't seem to fit well. Picture quality not good at all. had to hold connections by hand to keep screen from flickering. I do not recommend."
2,Interference,"I bought two of these cables. Unfortunately, both cameras I hooked them up to now have interference (horizontal lines) going through the screen. The other cameras that I have the original BNC cables have no interference. The cameras still work, but the interference lines are annoying and take away from the clarity of the picture.I will probably have to try a different brand of cable."
3,1 Out of 2 Cables Were Bad,"I ordered two of these 50ft power/video cables to hook up my cameras to my DVR with. One worked, the other does not! Returning tomorrow for a refund. Everything else works fine so far!"
5,really good cable,The cable had less line loss than I expected. The picture was still very clear. Now I own three of these cables.
2,very light,this cord will work but allows a lot of interference and is not very ruged . would purchase the heaver cord next time.
3,Good cables but....Interference,"These cables work well, however are not shielded and are subject to interference. I am a ham radio guy and my 40w VHF transmitter causes interference on this cable. I believe it's due to it not being shielded very well, if at all. I have another CCTV camera that is not affected however has a much thicker shielded cable jacket. The cable does work for what it is intended, however beware of interference. The only time however is at night time when the IR is active. I get some lines of red/blue when the transmitter is active. Otherwise the cable is good."
5,"Funny, funny, funny....",This book is fabulous. A great gift for anyone that has ever been in a wedding. The illustrations are adorable! Great fun! It will keep you laughing for days....
3,Not exactly practical,"The book was cute, but few of the ideas were actually practical. 101 Uses for a Bridesmaid Dress was not what I anticipated. The 101 uses seemed more like the first 101 things that came to the authors mind. Not exacly clever."
1,I am Returning this Book,"I anticipated ""101 Uses..."" to be lively, funny and relevant. The illustrations are contemporary and cute, but the humor is empty and pointless. Because it has no depth, this book can be ""read"" in a matter of seconds. I purchased it with the intention of giving to my bridesmaids. I am returning it because I don't want to insult their intelligence."
2,I bought this for a class only,"I needed this for a class. Lucky it was low cost because it is not a field manual, it is not about a city terrace. It's like a random rambling book."
3,Has This Title Been Remastered?,"The two ""best of"" editions that were out a while back that comprised about 60% of the show were hit or miss in terms of video quality. Some looked pretty good, others looked like recordings from old VHS tapes. Wondering if these episodes have been remastered? If not, its kind of pricey, even with Amazon's discounted price."
1,Where Is Chuck?,"Don't buy this video if you are a Chuck Connors fan, eg. from the Rifleman days which is why I bought it. Chuck is hardly in it and he doesn't appear until half or more than half the episode is over. He seems stiff and uncomfortable playing a lawyer. (at least how he thinks a criminal defense lawyer should be played) I'm not a Ben Gazzara fan at all so this was a waste of money and I didn't watch all the videos."
5,A lot of fun,"I love these old shows ranging from Peter Gunn to Wanted: Dead or Alive... and this one is no exception and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Good stories, well told and tightly scripted and shot, and terrific acting. Recommended to any lover of old TV series...."
4,Chuck's jaw,"I loved Chuck Connors in ""The Rifleman"", but this incarnation takes some getting used to. Ben Gazzara is elegantly understated as a cop who dates the same woman without thought of marriage."
3,Good buy!,For the price this was a really good buy for families that travel with children. Supplies lots of great activities to pass the time.
2,Inaccurate,"This map may be designed for children, but it should be accurate. I don't have it on hand to look at now, since it was a Christmas gift for a child, but I do know that it shows a rocket blasting off from near the southern tip of FL, no where near Cape Canaveral, and it also shows a steam boat in the center of the state of MS, not close to the Mississippi River. I have lost confidence in Rand McNally because this is the second purchase I have made that contain gross errors."
2,A bit basic and flimsy - not what I expected,"This is quite nicely presented, but it's just a thin paper map and it won't last long. Perhaps one or two journeys before it gets holes in all the corners etc! It retails for $1.95 according to the map itself, but Amazon sold it to me for $3.95! I felt like I got ripped off there..."
2,"Not worth Amazon's price, barely worth Rand McNally's price",Amazon charges $3.94 for this item. It's barely worth the $1.95 that is stamped on the upper right hand corner of the map by Rand McNally themselves. Pretty much a rip off. I should have sent it back.
2,Not very sturdy,"Tennis ball construction is not strudy at all. My dog loves the carry the toy with the tail in her mouth so that she can fling the ball end in the air. However, she got hold of the felt covering the stretchy wire and demolished it in 10 minutes.The tail part survives though!"
3,Didn't last long,"This did not last long with my dogs. The ball is not a tennis ball and is hard and brittle. If your dog is a chewer this won't last long. I actually saved the tail, poked two holes in a tennis ball, tied it tightly to the tennis ball, and it has lasted with no problem. Wished they had used a regular tennis ball in the first place."
2,Didn't last 10 mins,"I have a 15 lb mixed breed, who seems to destroy every toy she gets. I read the reviews and people said that there big dogs didn't destroy it so i took a chance. It wont last a minute if your dog likes to chew on them! If your dog likes to fetch and bring it right back then its a good toy but other then that try to find something else."
2,Destroyed in 15 minutes...,"My Boston Terrier can be finicky about toys, but he instantly loved this one at our local pet shop. It seemed fairly durable and was reasonably priced compared to many other toys, so we bought it and brought it home. To my surprise and disappointment, I discovered 15 minutes into his playing with it that he had ripped open the ""tough"" tennis ball. Maybe mine was just a dud since other reviews are positive, but you might think twice about this one if your dog chews toys aggressively. I'm going to cut the rest of the ball away from the toy and see if he still enjoys playing with the squeaky tail by itself."
1,The company i2Go is out of business,"Becarefull, the company that makes the eGo is out of business. No more support, no more web site, no nothing. Good luck on this one."
1,Can't Rate it because I can't get it to work,"The reviews I have read made me confident in purchasing this MP3. However, I cannot get it to work and it may even be my fault. The problem is 3 fold.1st it does not even come with a manual to tell you how to use it.2nd customer service has regular business hours EST. I am on the West Coast and have never talk to anyone. (I have had it for 2 weeks)3rd online help is not much better.I am sure this MP3 is great when you get it running, but if you ever have a problem.....you are on your own."
1,cd size for 45 bucks?,"when u buy this, it must be like you just want one to be ""cool""-ooo look at me i have an mp3 player because why would u want one that only holds 15 songs based on 4 min a song that is less than most cds hold its like buying a 45 dollar cd if u want one that holds more do not buy a 45$ cd.if u want something cheap but holds more than this go buy a macvision mp3 player for 25$ at famous barrand it even holds more.this thing even from its looks looks like it would break or crack.so go buy a better quality and space mp3 player than this igo2gogo,thing!"
1,Connie Kinney,"Actually I LOVE the e-go, It's the company support that is lacking. I read the negative reviews and can totally understand. My ego came under supplied but I did the math and figured if I bought a 2nd the cost of the flash alone would be equal. In doing so I have recieved all that I should have. I did notice one of the very favorable reviews here has the same name of person who responded to my negitive feed back before I think people should know they're review from MICHEAL PITCHER was from the VICE PRESIDENT of the i2GO company he gave me numerouse phone nos. however will not respond via e-mail...and I will not call as the item is only available on line so should the comunication line be."
2,poor service ...,"i ordered one last year, the software crashed all that time. i emailed them (because that's the only way to contact tech support). but they never replied.the sound quality is not that good either."
3,Bottles,"I thought these bottles would be good b/c I was back at work and the baby was now going back and forth between bottle and breastfeeding. However, after using them only a few times, the holes in the nipples all must expanded creating one big huge hole. At that point, the baby was drinking so fast and we didnt realize why until we saw the hole. We ended up going through all the nipples that came in the whole package. Now, I had to buy another bottle b/c we could no longer use them. I am going to try to contact the manufacturer to see what they can do b/c I spent a decent amount of money and they are now useless to us."
1,very bad leak,"Horriable nipple, the 3 holes on the bottom of the nipple cause a lot of leaking. Also the size of the nipple cap is non-standard, so I can't replace with a different nipple, which makes this bottle useless."
1,BULL!!!! I ani't payin that much,Bull!!!! Tell me who bought this so I can go Hit them on the head with a tack hammer because they are a RETARD
1,No table of contents,The Kindle edition has no table of contents. Are you kidding me? How am I to find what I want by thumbing through 100's of pages?
3,Somewhat pleased,"Subwhat happy with recipes..NOT what I thought...I wanted more noodle recipes and there are only a few..but seems like the recipes are simple after you get 3 ingredients into your home that I was not familiar with, but the ingredients are used in alot of the recipes.."
4,Nutrition Information Would Have Helped,"This is not a bad cookbook, it's actually quite good. However, there is no nutritional information--and I understand there are different nutrional values depending on different types of sauces (soy, oyster, etc.), but still, it would've given a general idea of the nutrition content of the dish. I have a friend that went to school for cooking in Bangkok, and there are dishes that resemble hers, but there are some that don't. The recipes aren't bad and there are great ideas presented in this book. I would purchase this again, but because there is no nutritional information available I decided to give it 4 stars instead of 5. It's a good book and it's great for the price!"
3,A great book...just not for me.,"Personally I thought this was a waste of money. Majority of the recipes are Americanized, which I wasn't really feeling.But, on the other hand, if you're not too picky on authenticity, or live in a smaller community where exotic produce and spices may not be available, this would make for a perfect cookbook. It's easy to follow and has plenty of recipes."
5,The recipes I've tried have been GREAT!,"I was a bit intimidated to try to cook Thai food. It just seemed like it would be so difficult! The other Thai cookbooks I've looked at seemed a little too scary- how am I supposed to shop for the ingredients if I don't know what they are? This cookbook did a GREAT job of explaining things to me- from the ingredients to the cooking methods involved. Even better, the food is AWESOME! The meals are similar to what I get at my favorite sit-down Thai restaurant. This book is well worth the money for anyone who enjoys Thai food."
3,No photos - Not authentic enough - Okay for Americanized Thai,"Purchased this book with high hopes based on other reviews. I was very disappointed in the fact that there are NO PICTURES at all. I am a visual person, and enjoy seeing pictures of dishes; especially ones that can be a bit complex. The substitutions of Thai ingredients completely change the dish. Ginger is not the same flavor as Galangal....I could go on and on. The authentic ingredients are not too difficult to find these days. You can order online or just go to a specialty Market. It IS worth the trip to get the right stuff to cook these dishes with. If you like more authentic books with pictures, pass on this one. Try templeofthai.com for a great website and supplier."
4,phenomenal recipes,"The recipes are wonderful, but I would have liked to see somephotos of how the presentation would appear when done."
5,Wife loves it!,Purchased this off my wife's wish list.She is really happy with this one and so am I.Have only had a few dishes out of this one but all have been tasty!
4,Not really the best but IT IS A GOOD BOOK,It is a decent book and is bascially meant to brush up your fundamentals.In that way it does fulfill it's function. The exercises are there so that you can practise your theoritical knowledge and that happens when you do not have access to solutions easily.Otherwise one tends to reach out for the solution manual at every stage. I would recommend it if you want to use it as a book to have most of the fundamentals explained in 1 book so that you can look it up anytime you want.
2,Not exactly what I was expecting...,"I received this item today and was surprised1) It was shipped from overseas (UK)2) It came with only one CD instead of two like a previous reviewer thought3) No paperwork - it came in a clear case with no artwork, info, etc4) Sonic Foundry sold ACID to Sony in 2003 (according to Sonic Foundry's website) and SF no longer provides support5) I can't get this to register online, which seems a little dodgy, but other than that, it seems functional. No huge library of loops, either. Can't really say I got what I expected."
4,"Two Incredible performances, two incredible songs","Two of the songs on this album are so good, I'd like to give it 5 stars, but there are several fillers, and the lyrics of ""My Name Is Earl"" [which continues ""and I need a girl""] make me wonder if he was the bloke The Dixie Chicks despatched! Ooh, it makes me wonder!The Loved One [hence the title] has a terrific 9/8 beat, with an infectious handclapping percussion and a simple, no-nonsense blues progression. Gerry Humphreys, the vocalist, is hot on this track, but even hotter on Everlovin' Man.There are a few other tracks that are OK, includingShake, Rattle and RollThe Loverly CarSad, Dark EyesandBlueberry Hillbut the album is worth it for the terrific two songs I have commented on above.You will also enjoy INXS' version of The Loved One.Recommended for lovers of good blues singing."
3,Great music but...,Listening to this CD it's hard to understand the impact they had at a time when there was no shortage of talented youngsters making exciting music. Beg borrow or steal Magic Box on vinyl to find out why. I suspect the CD was made from tired old tapes.
2,Not for oily skin,I have oily acne prone skin. This product is not good for already oily skin. My acne got worse with just two night use.
4,Moisturized,"Great moisturizer makes my skin feel soft and refreshed. The scent might be a little much for some people it isn't flowery or anything but it does have a distinct ""lotiony"" smell."
5,No problems!,Another problem-free sale. The item arrived in less time than expected. It was just as it had been descibed. Positive feelings abound.
3,Might be expired,"Good product, but the product itself smells like it's expired; there is discoloration on the top layer of the cream. I swirled it around with my finger and most of it went away. As far as performance, I've used it every night and it's very moisturizing, does absorb easily, but not sure if I see really noticeable results so far. I will likely try other creams before purchasing this again."
2,strong smell,I didn't end up using the product because it had a fairly strong smell that I didn't like. Others might not find it objectionable. I prefer unscented products.
2,Way too perfumy,"If you like the very strong smell of rose, then you might like this product. The perfumy smell is overwhelming. I don't like the texture either. Its like cold cream..same texture as Noxema original. Kinda greasy too. Not for me."
1,this is just terrible,"makes my skin red, makes my skin look worse..does nothing at all people..trust me..its terrible cream..look at other brand creams"
2,do not use if you have sensitive skin,"I guess I really can't give an accurate review of this product since I was unable to use it on my face. I do have sensitive skin, but for some reason was lead to believe that this product would not bother me. It did. A lot. Stinging and redness. So, it may very well reduce wrinkles, etc., but not on me lol. I bought it because I have heard very good things about it from other people. If your skin isn't super sensitive , go for it. It will probably work. But if you tend to burn in the sun, have to be careful what you put on your face in terms of make-up or creams, etc., i def would not recommend this for you."
1,water doesn't come out,"I just got it, per instructions, tried to prime the pump and....nothing. the water doesn't come out. I called the company, they said that I need air extraction pump or something like that to remove the air from the lines. They are going to send it to me -- will see. Bottom line is it didn't work out of the box as was the case with the other two reviewers. Apparently, when it works it's great (per the 3rd reviewer)so I'll keep you post it. I don't rate it because obviously I don't know how good it is when it works."
1,TWO machines dont work,"I bought one machine and it didnt work at all, so I sent it back and got another one. It worked GREAT for 2 days and then on the third day, I could not get the water to flow out of the spout. I called Krups to see if there was something that I was doing wrong, but they told me that I had it set up correctly and that they couldnt understand why it wasnt working. They told me that there was most likely some type of internal problem that they could not trouble-shoot over the phone. I asked if this machine has many consumer problems/complaints, and they said that it usually a very reliable machine....hmmmmm. Anyway, I am going to return it and get a Saeco instead."
1,water pump problem,I had the same problem as previous reviewer - water pump did not work. Had to return the product without using it.
3,Price versus Performance,"Original Bemis-brand pleated filter would evaporate a full two gallon tank of water in 24 hours. This product takes 36 hours to evaporate the same amount. Lower price of this version attracted me but will buy a Bemis style filter next time. A case of getting what you pay for - want cheap? Then buy this product. Want better performance, buy a Bemis brand filter."
4,Handy,"I have carried this knife daily for over 4 years. When new, there was a learning curve to handling it well. Partly because of the uniqueness of the knife itself and because of the stiffness from being new. Having large hands doesn't cause me any issues using it. The pocket clip is reversible, comes with extra screws and wrench to change or remove it completely. Only two complaints and they are minor. Actually one change would cure both issues. The relief grind on the blade is a bit too steep, which makes it difficult to sharpen and keep sharp. Being stainless contributes to this too, but once you get it sharp, it is a very handy knife."
3,Poor production values,"Richard Burton turns in a very strong performance, as usual, but the low-budget production values in this picture take it down a couple of notches. There is nothing even approaching original German equipment. In fact, the uniforms and equipment would have been unacceptable poor in a TV episode of the ""Rat Patrol"" made 15 years later. The whole point of Afrika Korps desert warfare is that the uniforms and equipment have to be cool looking.Frankly, this is not a film you'd ever need to see twice, much less own on DVD."
4,"Great Actors, Great Movie","Burton does a great job dealing with the humanity of Robert Newton, the arrogance of James Mason as Rommel and the hostility of the Aussies as he wins them over and Tobruk to boot. I can't speak for the historical accuracy of any of it with the exception that the Aussies, God love 'em, held Tobruk against very formidable odds!"
4,The Desert Rats,"Outstanding film. Another great one is the Desert Fox. A must see. To bad the film makers didn't use real german tiger tanks. For those of us who know the difference between a tiger, panther or sherman will be disappointed. Besides the tank issue a great film."
3,"Thoughtful, But Just Not Compelling",I wanted to like this book a little better and I can't say what is wrong with it. Some parts were interesting and other parts were dry. I had to push myself to finish it. Thus it was just OK in my mind. I procured my copy from the library and I'm glad I didn't buy it.
2,Very Poor Job Covering Philosophy of Religion,"Blackburn's chapters on God and Free Will are very, very disappointing. The current state of philosophy in these areas is so far beyond the way Blackburn portrays them, that his introduction is essentially useless. If you're looking for a rehashing of tired old arguments that believers don't use, (deceptively or ignorantly) presented as though that's the best case for Christianity, then this book is for you. Anyone wanting a little more substance about God and faith should look elsewhere.For a good introduction to philosophy of religion I recommend:Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldviewby J.P. Moreland and William Lane Craig."
3,"Okay, I'm Thinking - Now What?","Simon Blackburn's ""Think"", which must have taken him several days to write, is a wonderful book. If Kant's ""Logic"" - in my opinion the greatest introduction to philosophy - rates five stars, then Blackburn's ""Think"" gets at least three. Blackburn excels at rendering philosophically weighty issues light and fluffy. And Rolf Dobelli is right to compare Blackburn to the mature Ezra Pound. Indeed, Blackburn is to philosophy what Pound was to ethics."
2,Though Provoking But No Skeleton,"My book club and I all agreed that this book left much to be desired as a survey of Western Philosophy. I had hoped for a better skeleton to hang the fabric of Philosophy upon. However, one cannot go through such a survey without being stimulated to think deep thoughts - 'Do I see red the same way you see red?' - and so forth.The author did refer to previous philosophers as he progressed in the book, however, It just didn't hang together."
2,"If not compelling, then at least original.","Whether or not this introduction is compelling is a matter of dispute. It is beyond doubt, however, that Simon Blackburn has written an immensly original book. Indeed, with the blessing of the Oxford University Press he took philosophical originality to a new level. Consider, for example, a sentence on p. 16: 'But by Descartes's time things were changing. The Dutch astronomer Copernicus had discovered the helicentric (sun-centered) model of the solar system.' (Compare p. 8 to see that, as far as Copernicus's nationality is concerned, things were changed permanently.)"
4,Don't let that first review keep you from this book!,"I was looking for a ""primer"" on philosophy...who said what, when and so on. Though this wasn't the book I was looking for, I found it engrossing and interesting.After trying to wade through Durant's pompous prose in ""A Story of Philosophy,"" Blackburn's straightforward style was very refreshing. Like a good novel, I couldn't put it down and sometimes jumped to the end of the end of a chapter just to peek at the author's conclusion. Blackburn never really gave definitive answers to life's great questions, but that made it even more satisfying.For a novice, like myself, the terminology was a little confusing and I'm still not sure who was associated with what school of thought (I wish I had had his dictionary to read along with this), but it left me wanting to know and read more."
5,It' s a good book to realize ship models,"""Architectura navalis mercatoria"" is an interesting book. F.H af Chapman was the first person in his century, who tried to build ships at a mathematic method"
2,speaker repair kit,I followed directions completely. After finishing and letting dry played the speakers. Glue didn't stock most of the way around. I will have to try to re-glue.
1,Prone of Errors!!,"To prepare for SCP exams, I got the official Manual and this book.I have just finished reading 10% of the contents and browsed the rest. To my disappointment, it has many many errors. The author doesn't know in depth of the TECHNICAL.Though $$$ wasted, I am glad I revived the book by ways of having it recycled.Author doesn't have a certification. So think twice before purchase."
4,Don't listen to stupid 1 star reviews.,"I'm not going to write a review about this book because there are already some excellent ones. I do however want to clarify the lies that some of the negative reviews are saying about this book ie; the book says wicca is an ancient tradition. The author DOES NOT say that wicca is ancient but says that it is BASED on ancient earth based religions: paganism, witchcraft etc... Wicca was invented in the 50's and the ideas are from various religions. So don't listen to the negative review this book is pretty good, but still I wouldn't say its the best book on the subject by far."
5,This is the BEST for those who are new to the craft,when i was younger i had always had an urge to learn magick. it felt natural. i found this book at a book store and originally bought for a friend. i took it home and read it and had to keep it for myself. it is perfect for a person to learn the craft from even if you arn't a teen. as long as you are a teen at heart.
3,Too complicated spells,"This book is good because of the variety and number of the spells. (it doesn't spend half the book reiterating what wicca is) but the spells require many expensive ingredients, teenagers whose parents aren't wiccan won't be able to do these spells because they won't be able to get to a new age store. The spells are good and they do work, but do to the complicated spells i have to give it 3 out of 5 stars."
4,This book is good!,"This book is really good. I read it, but now I want to buy it! There are spells like seeing the future, Find a true friend, Heal a broken heart, Banish rumors, be invited, protect privacy, Make colleges BEG for you! There are more, but these are really good. But this book. You will enjoy it, guarantee. It's a witchy type of book."
1,Absolutely awful,"... The 'spells' in here were nothing but nonsense. Anyone who's truly interested in the craft should pick up a book by Cunnigham, not something of this low standard"
1,Makes Me Sick!,"You can't package Wicca in a cutesy little book. Now, people out there won't take us teen Wiccans and witches seriously because of this crap. I mean, all of the authors making and mass marketing these books for teens who watch 'Charmed' and 'Buffy' and think magick is a cool thing to play with should be ashamed. That's what all these ""teen witch"" books are for, to make money for corperations and authors. UGH!"
1,Waste of Money,This program is the worst I have ever tried. The instructions are confusing and half the information you need to set it up isn't even there. The program doesn't work like it says it does.
3,So so liner,"I really like the idea of this liner - that it's chlorine and chemical free - but I don't like how they bunch up and don't stay flat when wearing them. The adhesive does not work well. I think a better adhesive is needed and a thicker line of it so it adheres better as a pantyliner. I would have rated it lower but given that it does fit the bill for a natural, chemical free liner, I gave it 3 stars."
2,Bunches Up,"I like that these are made with cotton without any harmful chemicals. They are thin and breathable, but too small. The adhesive doesn't work well and they bunch up right away, offering no protection. I won't be buying these again."
2,Sensitive women who are bare down there,"I found the top material to be a bit ""itchy"" and thicker than the normal panty liner. The top part is cotton, but the middle parts have cellulose and corn starch. It sounds like a nice good absorbent material, but just be aware, if you have any allergies. Also, the adhesive appears half the diameter of normal adhesive, and is less sticky, allowing the pad to move around a bit. I did not like this. I don't have much hair down ""there,"" so I found the top layer to be more itchy-feeling. It would be nice if they made the top portion more ""compressed"" so the little fibers don't stick out so much. But, it might not matter to women who have more hair down ""there."" In terms of absorbency, I can't rate, because I could not bare to wear it more than 5 minutes, it was very itchy on my semi-bare skin."
2,Ok liner,"I was excited to purchase this item at my local grocers and I have been using them for about 2-3 weeks. I felt good about purchasing this item because it is chlorine free, biodegradeable, plastic-free, fragrance free, and chemical free, BUT I will not purchase it in the future. If you are looking for a longer liner or medium sized liner, then this is not the product for you. The liner is extremely small and it falls apart. The adhesive is not really sticky so the liner moves around.I am hoping that the company will make other sizes and if they do, I will definitely purchase it, but at this time, I don't recommend this product to anyone."
2,This product used to work,I have used this product line for the past 5 years. The sanitary napkins worked very well. They are almost too sticky at times. I have experienced no bunching. Unfortunately in the past year I have had burning and itching only when I wear the panty liners. Either something in their product line has changed or I have develped a new allergy. It's nowhere near the reaction that I have with everyday products but is irritating and wakes me up at night.
1,Don't like them,"I bought these for cheap from Swanson's. Only three bucks for 30, but even at that price they may not be worth it. For me they fall apart quickly. I think for anyone below a size 14 who has very light discharge (gross word, I know) they may be fine. If you're a bigger size and have a moderate to heavy flow you should not expect that these will hold up all day. I have to wear them all day everyday that I'm not on my period so for me these just don't cut it. Also, because they fall part, they make me a little itchy. I have to change them once or twice in the day and before bed. It's sad that there are so few healthy options on the market and so far with these, I'm seriously disappointed.I won't go back to the chemical kind, but if this performance is gonna be my only option that really sucks!"
2,Very Disappointed,"I was excited to find a chlorine-free panty liner; however, I could have just used nothing and had the same results. The adhesive is so weak that the liner never stays in place if you move at all. If you do happen to stay still and it actually catches something it comes right through the other side. The only reason this got 2 stars instead of one is because at least the company is trying."
2,Fall apart in a few hours,"These pantiliners are very soft, chemical free, odor free. What I didn't like about them is (a) their very small size (b) the fact that they don't stick well, so they ""move around""(c) the fact that they literally fall apart in a few hours."
4,Top of disposables,"Most satisfactory disposable pads.However with gladrags or other organic cloth pads,Money/resources saved, Soil/plants fed"
4,"Nice for cooking with, not quite all-purpose","This spatula has plenty of reviews already but I have something to add: this spatula is very nice to use on the stovetop, but I find it too stiff to use for getting batter off the sides of a bowl. For that purpose, I'd pick a spatula with a larger and more flexible head. (This one measures 2.5 vertical inches from the base of the head to the pointy end.) But for stovetop use this one is very nice, the right size, well balanced, and great seamless construction. I'm glad I bought it."
4,Another band that have yet to disappoint me,"Even though its a short cd, its a nice thing to add to your collection. The two new songs are both VERY well written, and they just keep getting better everytime they put something out. I alone however, bought it for the Faith No More cover 'Zombie Eaters' (featuring Chino Moreno). This cover is near perfect, and i cant stop listening to it. Although its a cover song, it could easily pass as their own, and flourish.Arrastra - 5/5 great song, hope it makes the new full-length.Zombie Eaters - 10/5 this cover is beyond great to me.Reservation For Two - 4/5 another great song to add to the library.Territorial Pissings - 3/5 not a great choice of song for them, but good.Red Rain - 3/5 also not my cup of tea, but done well.Also, there were only 20,000 pressed, so if you want this, get it."
3,"Not bad, but nothing like their first two.","If you are a big fan of them, this is worth checking out, but otherwise, stick to their first two albums and until they put something out that is really good again, just live in the past. 2.5 stars."
5,The Train,"Well acted, well directed historical fiction about the Nazi invasion of France. Some parts too violent for young kids, but the train wrecks and explosions are masterpieces. Great movie!"
4,"Top-notch, completely absorbing suspenser.","This suspense-filled epic of a train carrying stolen French art treasures to Germany and the attempts to waylay it is in the same league with Frankebheimer's Seven Days in May and the Manchurian Candidate. Lancaster is in top form and so is Paul Scofield as his ruthless, icy cold adversary. Good performances too from a totally European supporting cast. Dubbing was probably involved but as with Das Boot it is expert dubbing. Very highly recommended."
1,the Train,Oops. I was sent a DVD that won't play on any of my players because it is formated for another region. Too bad as I wss looking forward to it.
1,Late but in good order,"I finally received this DVD and it was great...OK, it took longer than expected...but it came in good order. For some reason I can't change the rating on the movie...so I'll just type it here 3 1/2 Stars!"
4,cute little teapot!,"I bought the teapot for my adult daughter for Christmas. It was packed well, so it arrived in good condition. It was cute and she seemed to like it."
1,Buyer Beware,Item is packed as to guarantee breakage in shipping. This happened both in the initial purchase and with the replacement after returning first purchase.
2,Nice concept - Weak execution,The content of this video is just too basic to be worth the price. It's a shame because the on camera talent is Bob Krist who is clearly knowledgeable and I'm sure could offer a lot. But whoever produced this scaled it down so much as to not be useful. Skip it.
3,Very basic,"This dvd shows the basics of photography, and how to use your Nikon camera. If you have been shooting for some time, don't buy it. You will just be bored (as I was). However, if you have just bought a Nikon DSLR, and you want to get some tips on how to use it, this dvd might be helpful. I don't think it goes into enough details, but it's a good starting point."
2,"Nice try Nikon, but it's not worth it!!!","Nikon School DVD ""Understanding Digital Photography""This is truly a beginners presentation by Nikon. If you are beyond the beginner stage of photography, stay away from this DVD. For me it was a waste of money."
5,Tight,"Yo, this might be the best one out of all the 57th Street Rogue Dog Villian cds, even though they're all good. Again this one if hard to find and out of print, so you'll have to order it off the internet some how. This cd includes, Millinnium Mitch, an off the chain song it's a remix type version to Mitch Bade by Tech 9. So if you're into Tech 9 or you just plain like that gangsta ish to go out and find this cd."
2,a rug it's not,this rug has been on the floor for months and it still wont lay flat.Its not the softest rug either
2,Not what I expected,"I received this Sink Daisy order today. It's what I ordered but I thought there was 2 to a package. The description says 1pk. Doesn't 1pk mean 1 package of 2? I guess I shouldn't have assumed but wow, I paid almost $9 for 1 Sink Daisy and I have 2 sinks. So I'm supposed to pay another $9 for another one? Then I found one for 1.79 plus less shipping. ""Not a good shopping experience."""
3,I love to eat,"Though this contains many yummy recipes, I don't find it low enough in carbohydrates to maintain a brittle diabetic's sugar level. With the push on carbs in diabetic diets, I found several of these recipes a little on the high side."
5,Love this book!,"Since my husband is a diabetic and a recent heart patient, I had to find recipes that were low on sugar, salt and fat. This book has delicious recipes that are very healthy for all of us. Easy to read and simple to understand."
5,This is a great cookbook,I purchased this cookbook for a friend with diabetes. She never realized how this disease would change her life. She is very pleased with the recipes and helpful hints throughout the book. Very user friendly and down to earth..
3,The 30 Day Diabetes Miracle is more effective at controlling blood sugar.,"This book was fine, but I highly recommend the 30-Day Diabetes Miracle series for managing your diabetes and creating a whole new healthy lifestyle! It's more in tune with ""good carbs.""The 30-Day Diabetes Miracle: Lifestyle Center of America's Complete Program to Stop Diabetes, Restore Health,and Build Natural VitalityThe 30-Day Diabetes Miracle Cookbook: Stop Diabetes with an Easy-to-Follow Plant-Based, Carb-Counting Diet"
3,Needs more pictures,"The book is very helpful but it needs a picture for each recipe. You just get a sampling of pictures but most of us know, part of the enticement to cook is envisioning how the meal will look like when it's put together."
1,Indefensibly bad,"If you like iceberg lettuce and fish sticks and think that Italian parsley and cilantro are interchangeable in a salsa recipe, then you might like this cookbook. For the rest of us, it's another one that carries the AHA and ADA approval imprints, which blows the credibility of any cookbook that does for me. Try the EatingWell one."
5,Very Nice!,"I did enjoy reading through the book and getting ideas for recipes. Although I am not diabetic, it never hurts to eat healthy. Anyone who wants to improve their health can enjoy this book."
4,This is a Must Have Book,This Cook Book is a must have when learn to cook for the new diabetic person or persons its very important to do thing right and accordingly thanks for the book it help me and family and friend to cook for heart patience and diabetic's as well
1,Sugar in almost EVERY recipe.,"I was completely disappointed in this book and in fact, threw it in the garbage. I expected to find recipes to supplement my current bland diet, but upon examining this book, I found sugar to be in almost every recipe, including main courses, not to mention the deserts. This would be fine for someone who is simply trying to lose weight, but not for a diabetic. Especially one like me who is Type 2 and needs to strictly control their sugar consumption. I don't feel this author understands diabetic eating nor diabetes itself, as not controlling it properly can result in blindness and loss of limbs. I do not recommend this book for anyone who takes their diabetes seriously."
3,Could be good,"I have had my R1F for 1 year now, had several problems, returned my computer to the company 3 times, they have replaced the unit with a brand new one. Now after one year, the battery is still fine and the pointer does not get stuck in the corner. Now, it works fine, I still have some minor issues probrably related to vista, It is well built, nice feel of the keyboard, light weigth. Hope they get to solve their problems."
1,Don't Buy,"After turn few minutes running, it become extream hot around screen panel. This one also had cursor problem. Already sent back to Asus for repair & got it back. It seems still has minor problem. Buy HP instead."
2,"Nice sweater, but odd fit maybe","Bought this for my doberman who is always cold. It looked good and seemed to fit well, and he liked it. The turtle neck was especially nice since he has a very long neck. But something weird is going on with the sleeves. I think when he lays down they pull tight on his arms. He tries to get up but his front legs are asleep! So unfortunately I have to closely monitor him wearing it, which defeats the point cuz I wanted something cozy for him to sleep in since night is when he gets the coldest. Oh well! One more thing... I didn't notice in the picture, but there are 2 straps from the bottom of the sweater that wrap around the haunches. We had a good laugh at our dog's thong, then promptly cut the straps off."
3,Boxer's sweater too small,The sizing on this sweater seems to be off. It should be at least two sizes larger to fit my 55 lb boxer. The leg holes in the front are to tight and she can't move with it on.
2,Cute but tight,"My 75 lb lab cross is very slender, but the sleeves in an XX-large are way too tight even on her. The neck is fine, but I'm going to have to figure out a way to enlarge those arm holes for her to wear it."
2,XXL to fit a Pekingese,"I bought this sweater XXL for my 80 lb great dane lab mix. When I opened the package I had to laugh because it was the size to fit a Pekingese! So, if you have an XXL Pekingese I highly recommend this sweater. Although, it is a very thin acrylic knit which may not provide much warmth and if your looking to make a fashion statement, well the workmanship is pretty shoddy. You'd be best off looking elsewhere."
3,Wrong sizing,"If you would like to order it for your dog - go 2 sizes up. I bought XXL for my German Shep (according to the chart), and it should have been two times as large as it really is. I am going to give it to my fried who has a Lab mix, about 2/3 a size of my dog. Hopefully, it will fit that dog."
2,Wish I'd had another reader's review,"The subject matter,a modern woman and her life events in post apartheid South Africa, could have been such fascinating material. When researching a new read for our ladie's monthly book club, I relied on the editorial reviews acclaiming this new author and her insightful story. What I read was a predictable and somewhat trite rendition of a very tragic incident that supposedly led to the ""blossoming"" of faith and spirit. I kept waiting for the author to tug at my heartstrings and change my spirit too, but in truth the verbage was dull and uninspiring. I do think the plot had great merit and I could actually see it being rewritten someday with vigor and passion."
4,interface cable,"Got the cable within a week. Cable fits and works just like the OEM cable, but is a less expensive alternative."
2,Old fashion,"Didn't fit my needs. now a days serial is not available.So you gonna need an adapter with sooftware to make it work.My mistake, at least the product arrived in no time in ""the old Country""."
3,Gilsson GPS cable DB-9,"This cable is for the Garmin eTrex H GPS. It has a serial port connector for the computer. You will need an adapter cable capable of supporting 32/64 bit and windows or mac operating systems, if you own a computer with USB ports only. So, this cable does 1/2 the job. Next you will need to buy Map Source from Garmin and download it to your computer before your Garmin will transfer data to your computer. The eTex H is not compatible with the Garmin Base Camp program. Call Garmin tech support before buying anything!"
4,children with adhd,Great book in easy to use with your child. I great starter book for the very confusing word of ADHD information.
3,Basics to Venture Capital - The Legal Side of Things,"Bartlett writes an informative book to those unfamiliar to the details to deal structuring, particularly with the documentation side. This book is truly for the novice who is unfamiliar with business and legal concepts. Those with a business or corporate law background may see this book as a ""nice"" reference source. If purchased, it's likely to be unused.Individuals who wish to know the legal side of basic business structures, term sheets, business plans, and such would find the book resourceful. Though it's only 157 pages, it provides a foundation to the non-business professional."
2,WYSIWYG is not what you'd expect,"I tried this product and luckily I was able to return it. When I first ran this program I must have stared at the screen for five minutes trying to figure out what to do first - not very intuitive in my opinion.The drag and drop is atrocious - it's not exactly what I would call WYSIWYG. I dropped a small graphic onto the page editor and the graphic expanded to fill the whole page. Placing text is just as bad. When I think of WYSIWYG, i expect the graphic, or text, to stay right where I placed it. Not so - everytime I placed another object on the screen everything else shifted.After reaching my max frustration level, I decided to consult the manual. I discovered that it is necessary to work with tables and frames to get a decent layout. What a pain in the a$$ (wallet)!Try Web Easy by V-Com. It's much easier to use."
4,Web Page Construction Kit 6.0 is excellent,"I am an experienced author and well acquainted with publishing on paper. I found on producing my own website with no previous knowledge of HTML that this programme served extremely well for the type of site I needed, mainly text orientated, easily upgraded and edited, with a swift built-in ftp and very few problems. I found it relatively easy to fit in images. The manual had all the usual problems of manuals written by writers from the IT world and lacked an accurate structure but with patience and an expectation of not everything being obvious at first glance, I soon became accustomed to it. I did not require advanced animations etc so cannot estimate how good it might be for these but I rate it as the best of the web builders for beginners I have seen, far better than Microsoft's ""front page"". I have not yet seen version 7.0 but hope to buy it when it is available here in the U.K."
1,Not happy with Liss chargers,"I purchased 48 of these. I was at the end of my first box of 24 and had been consistently finding ""duds"" since the Liss cylinders were purchased. Even when I was able to produce whipped cream, the pressure would fizzle out halfway through the cream, and I would have to add another cylinder to finish it. At first I thought it was a defective cream whipper and suspected a leak. Finally after two unsuccessful attempts in a row to make whipped cream, I used a gram scale to weigh the cylinders. Out of a box of 24 NEW chargers 13 weighed less than 23g, 8 of them weighed 20g(the weight of an empty cylinder) and had no NO2 at all. The ""full"" ones only averaged 25g, so had an NO2 charge of only 5g not the 8g that is stated. Needless to say, I won't be buying this brand again."
2,Not as good as other brands,"These are just okay.* After using about 40 of these, I can report they consistently have at least 20% less charge than other brands I have tried. With other brands, I can get 5-6 uses from each cartridge for my particular application. With these, I get only 4-5 uses per cartridge, at best.* The carton they are packed in is weak material. When mine arrived, the product carton had broken apart and the 50 cartridges were rattling around loose in the outer shipping carton. Never happened before with other brands. The product carton is thin, weak material.Other brands I've used include iSi and Mosa. I bought these because those others weren't available on Amazon at the time. I won't order these again."
1,canister didn't come with chargers,"I needed a new canister and all i got were the chargers, so i had to place an overnight Saturday order to get one. i have filed a claim and will get my money back from this useless company. they did even ship it for several days. Tried to ruin the holidays...but haven't succeeded yet..."
5,Excellent,"My little pooch had extremely fine curly hair that matted so easily, and nothing else would cut it. I got one of these and it did the job handily."
1,No storage case,"If you want the storage case, don't buy this item from Amazon. They keep shipping us the one w/o the case. They finally said they don't carry the one with the case."
1,Gritty and real...this is entertainment??,"This is an incredible documentry on 3 girls who are on the streets. One is a stripper,at the age of 15 none the less. One is wanted by the courts and in hiding with dreams of a pink wedding. The last girl is facing motherhood at a very young age. This movie is an engrossing combation of heart-breaking and life affirming human resilience. It is captivating and bittersweet,and one of the most human films you'll ever see. However, don't we generally go to movies to excape reality? This movie is just a bit too real...in your face hardships, and tears. If a dose of reality is what you need take a look at this very real, and very scary, look at these 3 girls lives. And you thought you had it bad........"
3,"Let The Church Say, Amen!","Drama In the Church was a compelling story of the lives of the women of First Nazareth AME Church. With one dealing with a drug habit, the other getting pregnant out of wedlock, another trying to hold on to her NBA bound boyfriend, and the last a devoted leader trying to deal with bedroom issues with her husband a vivid picture was painted as they all struggled with their home life and their belief in God.It was spicy, even for Christian fiction, but there were moments in the book that put me to sleep....just like church on Sunday morning. Dynah did a good for her first time out, and I hope to see something better the next go round."
3,Holy Hell Nall!,"1st of all, this book DRAGS!!! It did not hold my attention at all in the beginning. Mind you,Iam a fan of Christ-Fiction...So,it finally starts to pick up around chapter.12&boy does it take off! All of the several main characters drama has begun: ExCons,baby daddys,cheating,blunt smokers,double lifes&naive females! With the church members going thru so much,the pastors reveal at the end wash NOT a surprise! I have 3 stars because, every church has at least 1 of these characters &the author leaves you hanging at the end. .. wanting to know the outcome."
4,HHR trailer hitch,This hitch was so easy to install. I had to drill two holes in the frame of my HHR. It took me 35 minutes to install. everything you need is included.
4,Curt 11447 hitch,"This hitch is for my Wife's 2011 HHR, it took me about an hour to complete the installation. I watched a video on how to install, it helped greatly.."
3,I have a problem with rating this map...,"Rand Mcnally treated Muncie badly, with this all-in-one 2006 edition. Up till know Muncie had a dedicated map all to itself, at least between 1990 and 2001. In 2006 Rand McNally made a strange decision as many cities smaller than Muncie have Rand McNally maps all to themselves (say Roswell, NM or Capser, WY). Why does this matter though? Well it does, as now the scale is much smaller and many people have problems reading it. For that idea I would give the map 1 star. However, there is only one more map out there - Universal Map's Muncie. Sure, it's dedicated, but also much worse. So comparing just the quality of the maps, I would give Rand Mcnally 5 stars. Together it ended up at 3... It's a great map... but remember to take extra strong glasses if you don't have perfect sight!"
4,Wildfire DVD,I bought this as we like the Heartland series so well. Was not disappointed. Started off well and about the animals and those who love them. Now though it's starting to get more about the people and less about the animals. Prob. wont buy anymore unless it changes before I finish season one
5,WILDFIRE Rocks!,I loved it. I love the WILDFIRE series anyways and Kris & Junior will be together forever!
1,poor holding,I got my shipment and inside the package the tabs that hold my dvd's were all busted up and now my movies won't stay on the tabs and all 4 dvd's are all over. The dvd's will get scratched and ruined. Not very happy that this was not taken care of before it was shipped. I have never ordered off the internet before and this ruined that experience.
5,Customers pay our salaries!,John DiJulius inspires us with myriad ways to provide memorable customer service. It is both the steak AND the sizzle that provide customers with an experience that makes them want to come back. The author gives so many examples of ways to add sizzle to our customer service that using a small fraction of his ideas can pay big returns for your business and can turn customers into cheerleaders.
2,Ummmhh...,"I'm past half way through this book and all he talks about is little stupid things like "" in your face "" advertisment,I'm a small biz owner and let me tell you..good customer service is essential but the growth is all about the quality of the goods or services you provide,do you go back to a restaurant that sends you a stupid card if the food wasn't all that good ? not me..."
4,great read,"I like this book, it has great ideas and real life examples of customer service excellence. It is inspiring and well worth the read. It is an active read in my library of customer service reference books."
3,Don't try this!,"I bought this cd and I must say the first track is very nice. The other tracks,however, have much to be desired. The memory track is split up by a break in the sound. What it sounds like is someone pressing the pause button and then pressing it again to start again where they left off. He may not cough but you are interupted by a dog in the background and seems to people walking around the room. If you are looking for a good hypnosis tool, look elsewhere"
3,not bad,"This album contains some good music, but really, most of the songs are just filler. ""Devil Gate Drive"" is top notch, ""Can The Can"" and several others are pretty good, but your CD remote will come in handy for skipping a lot of the music."
3,"Excellent for kids, not so much for movie fans","As a fan of the movie Chitty Chitty Bang Bang since childhood, I immediately jumped at this game when I saw commercials for it in the late 90s. Of corse, not being too picky at that age, the last thing I noticed was that, aside from actually seeing the title character for about five minutes at the beginning of them game, it had absolutely nothing to do with the film of it's origin. Despite this huge flaw/scheme to get more fans of Chitty to give MGM more money, the game is quite fun. The characters are charming and their quirky personalities make the learning experiences in this game quite memorable. Plus, there's occasionally a tidbit of useful information here and there. Did you know ""[...]"" came from Thomas Crapper, inventor of the toilet? I didn't until I played this game.In conclusion:For fans of movie: BADFor kids who don't care either way and just wanna play a fun computer game: A-OK!"
4,My Baby wanted to climb on board with the other babies,"My 8 month old daughter likes to look at this book. The book contains excellent illustrations of babies doing different things. Some of the pictures are of babies, surfing, flying in airplanes,fishing in a boat, etc. This book is nice because it tells a child that they can do almost anything they want to. That there are no limits on what they could do. This is a nice book for young readers."
5,very informative,"Although I am a practising Thevardian Buddhist , I find this book on Tibetan Iconography and symbolism very interesting It have decipher the ancient secrets of the Tibetan and made it easy to comprehend to every lay BuddhistI strongly recomend this book to any inspiring Tibetan Buddhist learner"
5,She still likes it!,Royal Canin is all our 5 year old American Bulldog has ever eaten and she still likes it. Great for her coat and digestive system. A little more expensive but worth it.
4,Good quality dog food,"We love the Royal Canin brand and alternate between several. This would be perfect, but my lab eats it so quickly I don't even think she chews between bites. The lab specific breed formula is the only food that slows her down."
2,"Definitely not Back to ""School""","Other than being huge [the dimensions are given, but way down on the page] there is nothing back to school about this calendar. I have long been a fan of Kliban's Cats and have ordered his cat calendars many times over the years. I orignally ordered this one for my office at school. 16-month and a BACK-TO-SCHOOL title sounded perfect. Amazon's one and only picture seemed okay. When it arrived, and I saw the drawings on the back cover of the calendar it was clear this was VERY INAPPROPRIATE for school. These pictures were not available on the web page [and still aren't as of this writing]. There was no way to bring this into a school building. As a result I was forced to return it. If you like large and raunchy, this is fine, but I wouldn't keep it around the kids."
4,Alive and kickin',Classic JBL speakers are alive and kickin' once again! Quoted price for professional repair was $250 for both speakers. This kit was a fraction of the cost and only a few hours of my time. The instructions were easy to follow. The quality of the surround was nice and the finished product looked and performed like new.The only downside was the dust cape didn't fit exactly correct. After I fished with the first speaker I realized the fit wasn't great and I did some research and found that if you are careful you don't need to replace the dust cap (shim the voice coil). So I opted to leave that out on the second speaker and the visual result was better.
2,Don't bother,"Neither movie is presented in its original aspect ratio. I see that Amazon tells us they are 1.33:1, but the 2.35:1 Five Bloody Graves could have been letterboxed within that frame at least. It wasn't. Which makes any reference to this set showcasing the cinematography of Academy Award winner Vilmos Zsigmond a joke.The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because the set does contain come decent quality drive-in intermission concession shorts. But the producers of the DVD blew it there too by not providing the option to watch the intermission shorts, trailers and feature in order. You can only choose each element independently from the menu page."
3,nurse sherri,these are b movies and there kinda corny some may find them a four star and others a two star . i doubt there a five star rating
1,Disappointing,"I truly wanted to like this work - a story about a father's journey to come to terms with the senseless loss of his son by bullets fired randomly from the gun of another child. But unfortunately, Gibson's work comes across as an angry journal - more like self-psychotherapy than an interesting read. It is fragmented and uneven. From the heart to the page, something got lost in the translation."
2,alright alright,"although the book was fairly well written i am a bit angered by the way gibson puts down the college. the college is very much still aware of the shooting and i don't appreciate being asked if i ""go to that school where people get shot."""
4,A journey into the heart of a parent,"A moving account of how a father tries to come to terms with the random shooting death of his son. What we learn is that while the journey is probably necessary, there are really no terms to be found. No answers that will make dad say ""wow, now I understand.""But that does not mean the journey should not be under taken. His acount of handeling the weapon that killed his son is as powerful a passage as there can be.The book starts slower than it reads later in the text."
5,Not since Capote's In Cold Blood have I been as spellbound,"Not since Truman Capote's In Cold Blood have I been as spellbound by a book. The author of Gone Boy's thoughts and emotions struggling courageously to come to grips with a universe literally blown to smithereens are palpable on every page. The reader's responses run the gamut from horror to laughter, ever guided by Mr. Gibson's sense of irony and truth. The book puts me in mind of Pirsig's classic, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, combined with the drumming vector of Lee Marvin's movie, Point Blank. His confusion and pain become our confusion and pain. His search for meaning and consolation becomes our search. The author's final coming to terms with his son's death through understanding and grace is this book's unique gift."
5,helps my carpal tunnel,Works as advertised. Like timer funtion and use it daily for my bad carpal tunnel and it realy helps. Much better than soaking in hot water. Only problem is after power failure the heater turns on until you reset clock and timer. Perfect for me. Not so big as to take up a lot of room.
2,This is NOT the soundtrack of the West End Production!,"Here's the deal. I love Neil Sedaka and I already own SEVERAL of the various hits compilations that have been released. I heard there was a British production set to his music and I googled. This CD came up. In a fit of disco fury, I ordered without carefully reviewing the product info. Well, it is simply another compilation of his hits as ""featured"" in the show. I'm STILL looking for a soundtrack recording of this production, so if you know of one, let me know. As a big fan of ""The Boy from Oz"", I can just imagine that this production does for Neil's work what Oz did for Peter Allen. But for now, I guess my imagination will have to do!"
1,Burgundy Olefin Weave Hammock,I purchased this item last year. The color and material were exactly as they were pictured. The transaction was smooth and arrived within a week. I took this in for the fall and winter and put it back out in my yard this June. To my surprise within a month the color faded from burgundy to almost a pink. The material dryed out to a point of being uncomfortable to lay on and now the color rubs off on your clothing. Very disappointed in this product.
1,Horrible!,"I bought this book to learn about SUSE Linux 10 (as opposed to 9 or any other version). While I realize there is a significant amount of similarity between the versions, a book titled ""SUSE Linux 10"" should explain the differences.However, this is REALLY a SUSE Linux 9 book with 10 written on the cover. Don't buy it, unless you're looking for a SUSE Linux 9 book.I also purchased the ""SUSE Linux10 Bible (Bible) by Justin Davies, Roger Whittaker, and William von Hagen"" and is REALLY IS a SUSE Linux 10 book. I know because I owned the prior version and this one contains nearly 10 new chapters and even the content of each chapter has been rewritten.Bottom line: If you're thinking of buying this book, don't waste your $. Instead buy the SUE Linux 10 Bible."
3,SUSE Linux 10.0 Unleashed (Unleashed),"So so book. The introductory stuff is probably OK for total Linux novices, but for anyone with any linux experience at all it is light. Far better documentation on the web and in a typical linux distribution itself. The included DVD was good to have, saved the effort of downloading the 3GB image, but not worth the price of the book."
2,Big Disappointment,There is nothing 'UNLEASHED' about this book. It is merely a glorified installation guide... a basic one at that.
4,Dealing with Severe Social Isolation,"This is a somewhat sad story. A woman and her adult daughter Laura live an extremely reclusive life, and do so in a dark, cheerless flat. Perhaps the most memorable part of the story is when a gentleman caller comes. He wants to go out with Laura, to whom he says: ""Did anyone tell you that you are beautiful?"" Upon learning that she has never dated, he says: ""That's all the more reason that you should go."""
3,card is good but beware,"i just recently bought this card because it was a decent pci card for a good price. i figured it would work pretty well and it did. one problem however i noticed is the when you install the driver cd, it says that there is no card installed. this may be a minor problem but it still concers me.for [more] you can get a voodoo 4 4500 pci. this is a great card that out preforms the cougar. also in another review i noticed that the cougar card does not work with a 810e chipset. i havenr seen major problems yet but im not gonna wait and find out. if you have a 810e chip set you would be better off with a voodoo or an nvidia geforce 256"
2,The Last Year of Being Married,"Granted, Sarah and Paul's marriage was so - so; she'd cheated on him more than once, but one time had been prior to their marriage. They slept together seldom, but had managed to produce a son. Still, when Paul decided he wanted out, it hurt. The results of Sarah's coping with that decision and putting her life back together are chronicled in this book.** At the high spots, it is funny, and at the lows it gets a bit mean spirited, just like life. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
1,Baffled,"This book is proof positive that you don't have to have any talent to write a book and get it published. Ms. Tucker is not even aware of how to write a narrative, instead formatting her book like a script or a play. I find it even more amazing that people are actually buying it."
3,okay,"The sword looks alot bigger in the picture, if youre looking for a smaller sword this is awesome, but if you want some huge hunk of metal this isnt for you. This came pretty fast, and its okay quality, theres 6 bolts on the hand guard, 2 were missing when i got this, one on each side, so the blade was wobbly. Also the tip was slightly dented and there were scraches by the tip of the blade, so it wasnt new, it looks like someone had been stabbing boxes or something. And the metal was pretty crappy, not that i didnt expect that. so i would rate this 3/5 someone who wants a cool wall peice this is amazing, but if you want something that was made to be swung, look somewhere else."
4,suprisingly neat,"I picked this sword up on a whim at the local Ren Farie and was surprised at how nice this felt in my grip. Balance is pretty good for a Pakistani made sword (they are usually cheaply made and off center), and the overall design was interesting. As others have noted, it is the only two handed short sword I've ever seen, but I think it's unusualness make up for it's flaws. (spell check is telling me that unusualness is not a word. Well neither is misunderestimated and people use that in speeches about the CIA.) Any way, I picked this up for about $42, so if you need a short sword that looks a little exotic, by all means grab it."
3,Beware! The cover is not what you will get!,"This new origami book comes with a different cover, which display the simple models that will be presented in the book, they are all extra easy to do.Do not buy this book, if you expect to get the diagrams for the models in the photo which are: a hearth postcard, a Kawasaki'rose,and an advance box,because none of them are in the little book, it has 22 very simple and easy models. This is a very expensive book, not worth the price."
5,Topeak Prepstand,Great workstand. Very easy to use. Just set the stand to the height you want and lift the bike on it. I have other stands and this one is by far the easiest one to use. All of my bikes have cables that run on top or under the top tube of the frame. This stand was the only one I found that dident smash the cables into the frame when being clamped.
5,Powerful Kirk Douglas Movie,"Town Without Pity is a signature Kirk Douglas performance. He plays a JAG lawyer in Germany charged with defending a group of soldiers who are accused of raping a local girl.Douglas' character knows that to properly defend his clients (who include Richard Jaeckel, Robert Blake, and Frank Sutton), he will have to destroy the girl on the stand. He doesn't want to do it, but circumstances seem to point to its inevitability.Douglas always seemed to play one of two character types. As the villain, he was ruthless, ambitious, arrogant, and willing to do whatever and sacrifice whomever to achieve his goal. As the hero, he seemed to specialize in playing men who are decent, honorable, noble people who are trying to do the right thing despite overwheliming obstacles like bureaucracy, intolerance, and cruelty. In both, he excelled at playing the tortured soul who suffers despite his motivations.This is a great film, and worthy of many viewings."
3,Anti-death penalty attorney...,will embarrass and humiliate the victim in front of the whole town to attain his goal of saving the guilty from a death sentence.
3,Strange little film.,"Town Without Pity is a film that's mainly known for that Gene Pitney song, Town Without Pity (I love that song by the way), but this drama has its moments thanks to Kirk Douglas. This film is a about a young beautiful German girl who is raped by 4 American soliders. In the town that she lives in, the local folks treat her like damaged goods and degrade her beyond belief. Douglas is brought in to slam the girl on the witness stand, and he does without a doubt. The ending is very sad but I couldn't truly find anything concrete about this film. Disappointing but the story is heartbreaking."
4,Great Model,Brother had some good fun putting it together - challenge comes in painting it yourself. Great for aviation enthusiasts simply looking for a hobby.
4,Klasse all in 1,"Just wanted some thing that will last for 1 year... A lazy man shine.. It been only 2 months, can't tell ...."
5,"Excellent, as always",I have been using this product for many years and it never fails to impress. I even use it to clean and polish other things e.g. golf clubs ;)
3,all in one protector,"Not as good as product I thought it would be from reading on car care forums. Had to really rub to take off water spots after washing car. Leaves an ok shine but it is intended to be used with the Klasse glaze as the final step which I did not purchase, it is nice not to worry about getting it on plastic or rubber trim and deepens there colors."
4,Good Music,Being a filipino overseas i sometimes miss hearing from the rock bands on my home country. Finding This album online was great! I enjoyed the music. It was like meeting an old friend again.
3,Ship of Danger,"This was a good book with lots of mystery and adventure by Mabel Esther Allan, however I personally didn't find it to be one of her best. However, It did arrive very promptly."
3,When you want a real massage,"HoMedics Therapist Select Percussion Action Massage Cushion delivers a more forceful massage to your back unlike the other thinner, softer models. For the better massage though, you will find that it has a thicker, very firm pad which may be uncomfortable to leave in your chair after the massage."
4,Most entertaining!,My granddaughter loved this book and so did I. The story was very clever. Does this author have any more books coming out?
5,great coloring book and story!,"My daughter,Rachel,loves this book, and it is even more special because it is by her great-Uncle Bill!"
5,The cream of the crop.,"Anyone who thinks that this book is redundant, or just repeats spells, is insane. Thousands of spells were collected from every adventure, and magazine to make this the most complete listing of spells avalible. Many have also been updated to work with AD&D rules."
1,I found this book a descrace to the TSR's colection,All this book does is tell the same spells over agian that are in the Players Handbook like Ivisibility or wish of Polymorph other so please don't waste your time with this book
1,A non-sense house,"I bought this movie after reading some reviews, but after watching it, I was really disapointed. This movie doesn't have any sense, there are many characters that only appears to be killed. I like Stephen King's books, and it is hard to find a movie that makes honor to the book. I still think that the best Stephen Kings movies are: Carrie & Salem's lot."
1,A Complete Waste of Time,"This movie was the least scary, longest (I believe) and most pointless Stephen King movie I have ever seen. It was extremely disappointing. It may give you some of those quick scares when things jump up on the screen (I won't give anything away), but other than that, it basically [was weak]."
1,We Have Lived In The Crapsle,"This is just rehashed Shirley Jackson. It is absurd how much Stephen King borrows from other sources and basically re-writes old material, full of less interesting characters that are slightly modernized and then everyone acts like it's manna from heaven. It's ridiculous! The man basically just rehashes old TWILIGHT ZONE episodes and then expands them into novels. He has ripped off every single more credible author in the speculative fiction genre. H.P. Lovecraft, Shirley Jackson...etc. I mean he is wealth of stolen and at best cliche ideas. This ROSE RED nonsense which copies Shirley Jackson's style to the point where she would probably sue him were she actually still living. Hackneyed and only vaguely scary. The best thing about this TV movie is that it ends."
1,The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer II,How is this for a great idea....we can get two really bad movies out of one set..... Yes in fact we can use some of the exact same scenes from the Diary of Ellen Rimbauer in our second movie.....While we are at it lets make it 4 hours long and put it on two DVD's without ever telling anyone that the movie is continued on the second disk.... Heck it really doesn't matter since after the first hour any scene could work as the ending....In fact it would be merciful if people would end it sooner rather than later.Trash and a waste of time and money!!!!!!
5,"So Far I love the condition it is in, Have yet to finish it though!",Those of You who are fans of Steven King should definitely get this one it is one of my favorite and it came so soon in the mail ;)
4,True To King,"This movie is true to Kings style. The special effects are out of this world. The detailing so minut you must watch it without interuption. Although it is long, it tells a captivating story that no King fan would mind sitting through.The only deviation I found was the story line reminded me of the Haunting (The HELL HOUSE) movie. However King's Movie surpases that simularity to make it his own. This movie in my opinion should have been released in theaters. This is a must see movie for horror and King fans alike"
3,A good ghost story with a weak ending.,"I've noticed that most of Stephen King's made for television movies start out strong but lack finishing power in the end. Rose Red is no exception. Don't get me wrong. Even with the weak ending, I still love this movie. I managed to catch the series when it originally aired and later rented the DVD which does have some nice features on it. It's a good DVD to own. You won't prize over it as one of the top DVD's in your collection but you won't use it as a doorstop or coaster either.My suggestion... rent it before you buy it. It's not for everyone."
1,the worst stephen king adaption ever!,"this was the worst four hours of claptrap i have ever seen!stephen king is my favorite author,but he must have been on vacation or paying for his rehab when he wrote this dreadful screenplay.the movie was never scary and the premise of a haunted house in downtown seattle is ludicrous.i expected frasier and niles to show up with a nice cup of expresso!what was the motivation of the characters-why would the nice old lady and her friend- companion want to haunt and/ or murder these people?why was this house haunted in the first place?and why were the most interesting characters such as julian sands and kimberly brown (annie) never developed fully?please do not rent or buy this movie but rather find the much better haunted house movies _""the haunting (1963) or ""the legend of hell house"""
4,Pretty good,"*WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK*Rose Red is a pretty good film/mini-series that I'd recommend. The story may seem a tad cliche, but I thought the characters were unique enough to make it work well. I liked the atmosphere, too, it gave it just the right touch. I'd of liked it better if Nick and Pam had lived, though. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
5,worth watching again and again.,"Rose Red is one of those movies that stays with you long after it's over. Don't let the length of the movie (almost 6 hrs.) turn you off to watching it. It's well worth the time to sit down and watch this brilliant masterpiece. The cast was wonderfully chosen. From Nancy Travis who plays Dr.Joyce Reardon. The woman who becomes fasinated with a haunted mansion called Rose Red to the point of risking other peoples lives to prove to her boss and collegues that Rose Red truly is haunted. To Annie Wheaton played by Kimberly J. Brown who has the power to waken Rose Red from a deep sleep by using her mind to do. If your a Stephen King fan than you won't want to miss this, and for the rest of you who aren't, well give the movie a try anyway. You won't be disappointed."
3,That house is whacked out!,"Rose Red is a familiar story. People go into huanted house because they are paid alot of money. People get picked off 1 by 1. Survivors flee house mentally truamatized. This time the group is made up of psychic's and so forth and lead by a parasychologist. They are going to reawaken Rose Red, a house that has ""eaten"" countless people and has been ""growing"" on its own for many years. The group enters and the usual happens.What made this movie better than many in my opinion is the fact that the characters are very well developed and they are killed off in a totaly unexpected order. While there are better ""house"" movies out there (House on Huanted Hill, Amityville Horror) for a made for tv movie this one is good. Decent acting, decent special effects, slight jump factor, and a nice take on an old story make this movie a worth while watch. The only drawbacks are the 4+ hr length and [boring] ending. I recommend you rent before you buy."
3,an ok TV movie brought to life,"it was boring for some of the time but then theres some good scenes and some jolts. basically a true story and the place is real and I want to visit it. Julian Sands dies in this one, why, he was the cool person and so was Matt Keeslar, but why Sands DAMN IT. Stephen King has a cameo, just like some of his other books brought to life in a movie. basically soe corny effects and cheap dialouge."
3,Pretty Good,"I saw this movie on TV and I thought some parts were creepy and that the story in general was original. Especially the crazy mother who won't leave her son alone. I thought it could have used a little more blood (more than just a hand being cut off) and maybe more scares. Other than that, it was an overall good movie.Positives - Original Plot, Some good scaresNegatives - Could have used some more scares and maybe a little more blood."
4,It's pretty good...,"I really wanted to love this movie, but I couldn't help but be a little disappointed. Maybe this is just me, but I don't really find 2-3 hours of people standing around talking about a house scary or interesting. However, I did give it 4 stars because when it finally got going, the content of the movie was very good. It could've easily been condensed from 5 hours into about 2, and been a lot more fast-paced and interesting. Possibly the slowest movie I've ever seen, but still not bad."
1,was expecting MUCH better,"If you're looking for a good haunted house movie, pass this one up. Its overly long and totally disjointed. The obvious places for commercial breaks don't help. None of the characters are sympathetic in any way. And the ending is neither satisfying nor cathartic. It just ends.Again, if you want a GOOD haunted house movie, watch 'The Haunting' (1963) with Julie Harris or 'The Legend of Hell House' with Roddy McDowall."
2,It could have been better...,"I was really expecting better from this movie, even though many of Stephen King's books don't translate to movies very well. I think what made the movie so bad was the actors/actresses. And the actress who practically ruined the entire film was the lead actress Nancy Travis. She is gawd-awful. She seemed to only show one emotion and she always had that same stupid sneer on her face. If someone had cast an actress who could have actually ""acted"" (same with the other cast members) the movie probably would have been better. It's a shame to, cause the book was actually good and had me intrigued."
4,Good.,I've already seen the movie plenty of time but it got here in a good amount of time and it wasn't over priced.
2,Just OK......,"Leave it to Stephen King to give us yet another epic. Although not a terrible movie, it is long and can get boring at times. Overall, not a true horror movie.... notice PG-13 rating. However, Rose Red is a cool house! and does have some good scary moments. This movie was not a disappointment and will keep the viewer entertained. Be prepared for a long movie for this one is over 4 hours long."
3,"Poor acting, sometimes hard to follow what's going on","Stephen King wrote a good story that was ruined by poor acting. This was really not one of his better mini series for the following reasons: 1) as stated before, poor acting-- nobody is believable except King himself in his cameo 2) terrible special effects-- sure it was a made for TV movie, but come on... 3) story was hard to follow at times, and character's actions were unbelievable... I thought (without spoiling anything) ""Why are they doing this when there's that other VERY IMPORTANT thing that they should be concentrating on?""Good idea for a story that didn't quite turn out. 4/10"
3,Rose Red on DVD,"I never read the book, but the movie is decent. I have, however, enjoyed other Steven King books-to-movies (such as Pet Cemetary and Salem's Lot) much better. Keep in mind this movie was made-for-tv, so gore fans will be a bit disappointed.Still, Nancy Travis and the rest of the cast do a very decent job and Rose Red may go down as one of the creepiest haunted houses in movie history."
2,"""Emmers!!!""","The Good Things*A few neat, somewhat creepy special effects.*It's pretty well-filmed.*Some good lines.*Some interesting ideas.*Good usage of the setting.The Bad Things*Some parts are totally ridiculous.*Other parts are just plain weird or convoluted.*I really couldn't care much for these characters.*This whole story reminds me too much of ""The Shining.""For Stephen King, ""Rose Red"" is one of the weaker titles in his repertoire. It's mildly entertaining, but mostly because of the absurdity (especially in the characters and dialogue) and quality of photography. But if you're looking for a good serious horror film, this would not be it.The DVD has okay video and sound quality. It's entirely in fullscreen. If I recall, it has one or two featurettes."
1,UGH!,"No one even bothered to re-edit this waste of time and talent ...... a choppy, amateurish production with [handpuppet?] special effects ..... ""This dvd was Born Bad"".Judith Ivey is possibly the only reason for viewing this 'horror' although some of this is heavily borrowed from Julie Harris [""The Haunting""].Only if you really must ....."
1,Awful,"You really can't get a better example of a cast that cannot act than in this one. I don't think I need to go through what the DVD is about, but rather dive into what is going to be a rather scathing commentary of this DVD. The actress who plays Dr Joyce Reardon is stiff and spends most of the time smirking annoyingly. Somehow she comes across as someone who thinks her acting is top notch when nothing could be further from the truth. That alone is quite enough to ruin everything as she's the main character. Annie the autistic girl, you expect me to believe that girl is autistic?? If you are trying to convey someone who is autistic I would definately suggest you put more effort into the physical appearance of the character. Scary movie? Please. Storyline boring, nothing scary. The 'ghosts' and unnatural phenomenon is too unnatural nobody will believe it. I say stick to writing Mr King. Your effort here is just terrible. And I'm being kind here."
1,Worse than bad,"Like a bad dream come true, horrible acting, a miserable, boring plot, a retread of a thousand horror cliches' and Stephen Kings name. A sad, borring, utterly ridiculous mess of a movie that doesn't even live up to the standards of made-for-tv. It's litteraly a cheap, shot on video, soap opera with lots of cheesy camera moves, no decent effects or make-up and laugh-out-loud bad acting.Avoid at all cost. (And btw, I read Stephen King and know some films like IT & The stand are far better, I'm not just bashing this for fun, the movie is terrible.)"
2,I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT,"I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WATCH IT ON TV. AND EVERY TIME, I FELL ASLEEP. I DIDN'T GET IT. I KEPT GETTING CONFUSED. SOME PARTS I GOT SCARED: LIKE THAT UGLY CORPSE LADY WALKING AROUND THE HOUSE, BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT WAS SENSELESS TO ME."
1,Bad Job,This film was the worst haunted house film I have seen. It was very predictable. It did not follow Ellen's diary as it should have. I do not recommend it.
4,A good movie,"I thought Steven King's Rose Red was a good horror movie. I don't really like horror so maybe it is a film for those who are more inclined to movies that aren't horror. I first saw Rose Red when it aired on TV and I was eager each night when it ended to see the next part. The movie kept my attention till the very end, though there are some parts that are unexplained."
2,It didn't scare me even a little,"I'm surprised by how many lived. I'm also puzzled over the choices of who died. This movie goes through its hauntings without explaining enough.Why on Earth was Joyce Reardon so psychotically OBSESSED with Rose Red? It's never explained...nor is it explained how she came to know all these people that she would pay for their appearances at the house.Apparently the good doctor needed proof that the house was alive and kickin'. When she got her proof, she wanted more. Why, I don't know. I guess she wanted to unlock more secrets of the place, and folks dying kind of took a back seat to that hunger. But WHY? Why was she so obsessed?We'll never know, I suppose. Her acting was miserable. The acting of David Dukes (rest his soul) was miserable. Julian Sands was the best thing that happened to this movie that apparently strove to hire as many over-actors as possible.Average rating for an average movie."
5,another Stephen Kings,Stephen King is known for alots of scary movies me myself will not watch alots of scary movies cause the're not so scary but you can always count on Stephen King for the scary movies
5,AWESOME,I purchased the Rose Red DVD for my daughter as a Christmas gift. She had a copy of it in VHS but wanted the DVD for her collection. The price was great too. When she played it everything was great. She was very happy to get it finally in DVD. Thanks again.
4,Wonderful!!!,"Rose Red is a great movie,scary..twists and turns..spooky.I would recomend this movie to anyone who likes horror,thrillers and ghostly goings ons.This is one of the best.I am so happy it came out on video ..now I can watch it anytime.*I would also recomend ""IT"" also by Stephen King."
2,"Great Stephen King video, but shamelessly derivative","As an extended story on film, Stephen King popcorn entertainment doesn't get better. Julian Sands, Kevin Tighe, Nancy Travis and the rest of the cast do their best. But the story of a parapsychologist assembling a team of psychic athletes to investigate a long-haunted house with a history of inexplicable deaths is the legacy of Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House,"" made into a genuinely frightening classic film by Robert Wise, ""The Haunting."" Do yourself a favor ... get the Wise film. This TV fare is creepy and entertaining, but by no means memorable."
2,I guess every rose has its thorn,"I am a huge fan of Stephen King movies, with The Stand, It, Storm of the Century, and The Langoliers being some of my faves. But Rose Red as a movie stunk. What passed as the plot was confusing and boring, the character development was weak, and it seemed as if they relied too much on cool special effects to carry the movie. Frequently using my fast-forward, I suffered through the 4 hours hoping that eventually the action would start to hook me and take off, but it never happened. The ending was a huge letdown as well. The movie is hyped up as ""the ultimate haunted house,"" but don't expect to see anything more than predictable sounds and deaths in a haunted house. The idea behind the movie was intriguing yet did not translate onto the big screen. If you're a huge fan, it may be worth a rental but I definitely would not recommend buying it."
5,Mystery Lover,Red Rose is a wonderful follow-up for the Diary of Ellen Rimbauer. I have both tapes and have enjoyed them immensely.
4,A surprise.,"I really enjoy this 4 hours movie. The theme is not very original though but it is well done, well directed. The acting is alright and of course it's a Stephen King work before all, with all what it means.Some of the scenes are VERY CREEPY and it's 10 times better than most of the Horror movies you can find in your videoshop. Not to hesitate, it's god stuff. S.King makes a special and funny appearance as the pizza boy :) Only negative point, maybe the SFX.. it reminds me sometimes ""The puppet show"" or ""Creepshow""."
3,CREEPY!,"Sorry, I just do not like to think that a house is alive.I figure, if it's alive, it needs to clean itself and save me the trouble! OK, I'm dreaming here right, but this movie gave me the creeps! I watched it with a group who could not keep theireyes off the screen, but I found myself actually getting mad atthe people in the movie. I hate when that happens.I suppose for horror fans this one is good, as for me, I likemy house without a life of its own and when I want to leave, ithad better let me open that door!"
2,The tame side of the tame side of creepy,"I am a big fan of Stephen King's writing and watched Rose Red for this reason. As a scary movie, it was disappointing, it had a kind of nostalgic feeling back to the days when scary was a sudden breeze or a withered hand suddenly touching your shoulder. Scary has moved on, this movie however has not, not creepy in the slightest. Only recommended for die-hard King fans and the pre-pubescent."
1,Scary but haven't we seen this plot before??..........,"After watching this movie, I have more or less given up trying to find a really, really good Stephen King story brought to film - The Shining is by far the best. The plot of this one has been seen before. This one is just cheap chills and thrills and not much else. I found this movie in the 5.00 DVD bin at Wal-Mart. You most definitely get what you pay for. Mr. Stephen King: how about something really original that doesn't just go on and on and on - but really has a great plot, great chills - and when it comes to filmdom, a better cast would be a big plus. You are sooo talented - this one is so beneath you."
2,Rose Red,"For a start,this movie is very long,more than 4 hours.It is definitely not Stephen King's best movie. It's the same old storyand I've got enough of them.As a horror movie fan - it's a shame when you go to video stores and the whole shelf is filled upwith movies with the same story. It's either Friday 13-th's or Haunted houses movies.Shame really because Imagination knows no limits.And for the end I really miss ""Twilight Zone""serials.That's what horror movies should be like."
3,"Stephen King, A Master of Suspense, but is he scary enough?","I love stephen kings movies and novels. So many of his books have become great movies, and as this was originally just a screenplay into a movie, it lacked what all his other books have accomplished.... SCARY! It wasn't very scary, and the ended was very much a disappointment. I spent HOW MANY HOURS watching this thing? Ugh.. would more interesting things could I have done? If you are a Stephen King fan, you'll enjoy this. I prefer his books, to his movies, they just aren't as scary. There is just something more interesting about your own perception of the book, when Stephen King writes it. When you read, you make the story come to life to yourself, in your own imagination, and STEPHEN FEEDS ON THAT!"
4,rose red dvd,"let me srart by saying i'm not a S. King fan. except for GREEN MILE i really have never liked his work. i was really suprised then when my wife had me sit down for this series. great story,good acting. for [money] a steal."
1,Nothing New,"Do yourself a favor: rent or buy The Stand - Stephen King's epic tale of good verses evil...or better yet, read Shirley Jackson's The Haunting Of Hill House. Rose Red is regurgitated King with a dash of Jackson's chilling tale thrown in for good measure. There's nothing new here. The beginning seems promising, but once our erstwhile heroes enter Rose Red, it turns into a carnival ride for CGI addicts. Very disappointing."
2,haunted house flick,"pure garbage, the movie has no story and violates every convention is sets out with."
1,Read the book!,The book was great. The movie is too long and boring. Bears little resemblence to the book. Don't bother
4,Loved it!!,"I enjoyed this as a miniseries on TV and chose to purchase it. It is an eerie tale about a house that comes back to life through the workings of a child psychic. Of course, the movie was delightful when Stephen King shows up for one of his cameo appearances!"
4,Another great story,"I sat up for three hours in the ""AWE"" position last night. Sitting on the edge of the couch, elbows on knees, jaw draging the carpet, mesmerized by this story. There were new up-and-coming actors new to my eye and some seen previously in very different roles to this. All were excellent. It seemed everytime you think you know what will happen next, something very different happens. Though some of the FX were true to made for tv movies, it was really done well. Then there was the ever popular cameo of Stephen King with his comedic expressions that made me take a break from the chilling moments to laugh for a brief second only to know that something IS going to happen soon to return me to the edge of the couch. Great movie and I'm sure I'll be letting everyone I know that there's one more ""must see"" scare flick out there. Turn off the lights, light some candles and enjoy."
4,Four Fingers anyone?,"At first when I first seen Rose Red I thought it would be some ... old Mini series like Storm of the Century, but I was wrong. The Movie was great. My favorite charactor ( tell you the truth) was actuly Emmery. He 's misunderstood but people can relate him. But later on his fingers get cut of because Annie was possed for a second and slammed the door shut when he had his fingers in the door. I recomend you see this movie it was greaT!"
4,UNBIAS REVIEWER: Worth my time and interest,"I found ""Rose Red"" (the DVD movie) worth my time and my captivated interest. It has a storyline, a plot, and an actual ENDING (meaning NO CLIFFHANGERS). I truly enjoyed this movie. It was not gore-filled or heart-pounding to me, but it was captivating, suspenseful, and worth the 254 min. of my time!Unlike other reviewers, I have neither read the book, ""Rose Red,"" nor have I seen the movie ""Ellen Rimbauer."" Therefore, my review is ""strictly"" on the DVD movie ""Rose Red"" with no other reference source to compare and contrast the movie with or against."
1,Low-Grade Horror at its worst...,"The acting and directing in this piece of garbage is abominable. Typical TV level crap. What is wrong with the people who gave this good reviews? Are they that starved for entertainment? Are we actually supposed to compare this to other movies based on Stephen King's writings, like Misery and Pet Sematary and The Dead Zone? Please, there is no comparison."
1,"Dullsville, Baby","Rose Red is awful. King steals from a lot of better horror stories (including his own)to come up with this piece of crap. SFX are not too good, story is so long and drawn out (probably an attempt to hide how potholed the story is) and the actors are horribly miscast. I used to like Travis, but after the first ten minutes of this I was hoping she would get killed ASAP. In fact with such a group of annoying, unlikeable characters, the most frightening thing in the story is that King lets most of them live! Don't waste your time on this."
1,bad stuff,"Sounded exciting, degenerated into pretty basic horror house genre. The story made no sense, the acting was forced, the ending was almost laughably bad."
2,Save your money,"If you buy this book with the idea that it will guide you in the restoration of your M37, save your money because it does not do that. There are a few useful suggestions but very few specific restoration tips. The book is worth its original issue price of $20 but not much more than that. It's an interesting read but not a how-to book."
1,Worth It?,"This book was originally $19.95 and worth every penny of that sum! Most of the information included is from previously published Military Vehicle Magazine. A purist would be hard pressed to take much from this, all of the information is contained the G-741 Tech manual. Sorry Dave!"
1,"$225.00 bucks for this, you're crazy!!!!!","I paid $19.95 give or take plus shipping for this book a couple years ago. I was very disappointed with the book when I bought it, for the price that I bought it. I can't let someone pay $225 for this book.This book is what I like to call a hopper pastime. Or in other words, its good enough to be taken with me when its time to mail a letter, and maybe it'll come in handy if we happen to run outta TP."
1,Don't spend the money,Unless your interested in reading a short blurb about three bookstores reopening in Mississippi - don't waste the $5. There are no suggestions or strategies for owning your own business.
4,quickly learn Java?,"Indeed, Sikora offers a quick start to learning Java. He eshews an exhaustive enumeration of every core class in J2SE. Instead, he takes several high level topics and explains which common classes deal with these. A question arises. Can you indeed learn Java from so slender a book? Perhaps. Sikora teaches a core functionality. Made easier if you have already programmed in some other language.For graphics, he leads you right into Swing. No time wasted on the earlier and inferior AWT classes.For input/output, Java is more powerful than C or C++, but concomitantly harder to use. The coding is far more verbose, compared to a simple printf() or scanf() in C, for example. The minimal descriptions in Java given here are admirable in how he found the essence of enough to be useful."
4,Funny Characters,"This movie cracked me up. The characters involved are all hilarious. The plot is bizarre. The movie was made in the mid 1980's, but it seems very conscious of everything that made the '80s weird and laughable. Extremely enjoyable. And it has John Goodman."
3,Can't quite put my finger on it...,"I like this film a lot, heck--a whole lot. Too bad almost everyone I've shown it to politely said that it was ""ok"" or ""interesting."" It's one of the most bizarre films I've seen, but somehow manages to sum up what it's like living in a small American town. David Byrne wanders through Virgil, Texas meeting various odd characters, accompanied by the music of the Talking Heads. The off-the-wall commentary is perhaps the best part of the film; driving through the pancake-flat plains of Texas, Byrne comments, ""The radio reception is great out here!"" Or when he drives down and endlessly straight highway: ""Fancy driving!""While I did like this film, I hesitate to recommend it. Rent it or borrow it first--see if you like it."
2,25 Word Or Less Review,"Plodding and deadly dull predecessor to other, vastly superior quirky films. David Byrne does add a sparkle, and the odd Talking Heads material helps somewhat."
3,Deep in the something of Texas,"Weird, very weird. Virgil, Texas, is celebrating its sesquicentenial, and this tells the story of some of its strangest inhabitants: the Lying Woman, the Laziest Woman, the Shopping Mall People, etc. The movie is plotless and a bit too self-conscious. Lots of music going on. Although the picture raises some interesting questions and is funny at times, it collapses in on itself by the end."
1,Great Movie; Horrible DVD,"THIS REVIEW IS IN NO WAY a review of the movie, which is unique and fairly unmatched, and has set some artistic standards.Excuse me, but wasn't the brilliance of this movie at least worth.. well... a WIDESCREEN inclusion?Come on.Formatted to fit-your-tv only.No extra features, no insights, no commentary, and TWO - get this - TWO menu selections - either to select a scene, or simply play the movie.Warner Brothers went family-style cheap on this disc and it is a travesty to assume people with a DVD player just want a VHS-level rendition of an art film.Don't buy this - wait until a version comes out that shows evidence someone has given this incredible movie some respect.BLAH. Disappointing."
3,An Interesting Satire,My friend had to watch this for a class she was taking. Not something I would ever watch if I didn't have to. Not a movie I could appreciate.
4,Only David Byrne,"Only David Byrne could make this gently peculiar, plotless, affable, conflict-free, bizarre, meandering exploration of random pseudo-fictitious lives in the Midwest. I love its pleasant whimsy and quasi-ironic sense of hope and the Talking Heads tunes ain't too shabby neither. Song highlights include ""Wild, Wild Life,"" ""Papa Legba,"" and ""Dream Operator."" ""True Stories"" is a strange mix of quiet and deranged. It feels like a happy trip away from the hubbub. It also stars a young John Goodman.I know this movie is a little more obscure, but some special features might have been nice. Criterion should pick up this bad boy."
1,Slow moving & uninteresting,Didn't enjoy this movie. Watched about 20 minutes and couldn't bear it anymore. The story took for ever to get to the plot or point for that matter. Just not the movie for me.
4,It ain't about Texas,"A friend from the Lone Star state who saw this movie was upset because she perceived Byrne was making fun of Texans. I see it as making fun of America as a whole with Texas as the vehicle (it could have been Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska or Oregon, for that matter). This move crawls at places, but stick with it to the end because the talent show is not to be missed! Though his total screen time is less than ten minutes, Spalding Gray is great in this film, especially the scene at dinner. Anyone who does not possess the 'Heads album by the same name will rush to do so after seeing this. It's a winner."
4,Enjoyable offbeat,"David Byrne's smart take on eigthies absurdity is at times poignant, and often very funny. The songs are good (especially ""City of Dreams,"" which plays over the marvelous closing image of the girl wandering in the road), of course, and John Goodman gives one of his best performances, oddly enough!"
2,Interesting angle,Would have expected more balanced views given today' politicalenvironment. It lacks objectivity.
2,Frother doesn't last,"... I use the coffee maker nearly everyday and don't have any complaints. The espresso side works well, but the frother was inconsistent after about 25 uses. Now the steam still comes out, but it won't froth the milk. In short, I wouldn't recommend it. ..."
2,"Great, if you aren't a coffee drinker","It does work. The coffee maker is slow, and you only get about 2/3 the water you pour in, the rest steams off before the coffee is done brewing. The frother also works, but again, very slow & messy. The espresso steamer works great, no complaints at all there. Overall, the thing is flimsy and doesn't seem to fit together quite right. This is the first Krups product I've ever had any problems with. If you aren't a coffee drinker and will only be using this infrequently for guests, this is an adequate machine, just barely."
1,The Il Caffee Duomo,"Purchased Krups Il Caffe Duomo yesterday (1/24/03) because my old Krups (combination espresso/coffee maker) simply wore out from old age and lots of use.During first attempt to make espresso on the new Caffe Duomo Il, the handle broke from the piece that holds the espresso basket. While I can't rate performance since I did not have opportunity to use it, I can report that the construction was much flimsier than my older Krups espresso machine. I will definitely return Caffe Duomo. However, I do plan to upgrade with another Krups given the performance of my older machine."
3,Solid Pappano story,"Tortured lawman and misunderstood heroine meet in this rather sporadic tale of hot passion and mishaps. Ms. Pappano is wonderful with characterization, and her heroine, Hallie, is fun to get to know. Brady is sexy, if a bit less believable due to the melodramatic, soap-opera background he's been dealt (perhaps critics would refrain from making so much fun of romance if the authors stuck with more realistic scenarios...nah, probably not!). His long-lost daughter really steals the show for a while, but adds layers to this entertaining read. It isn't one of Ms. Pappano's best. It seems to wander from hero's tortured past to heroine's insecurity to fantastical action-adventure story to fun family tale (in other words, it did a little of everything but didn't really round-out any of the elements). The resolution to the romantic conflict is very anticlimatic after the dramatic end of the suspense element. Still, it's a good read."
3,The accompanying CD,"I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the piano accompaniment CD that came with this purchase. Definitely makes it worth the price,"
5,I love love LOVE this book (:,"Singing in Italian is so much fun, and this book just makes it funner! I like pretty much every song in here, but my absolute favorites are Caro Mio Ben, Sebben Crudele, and Gia il Sole dal Gange. (Sorry if I messed up the spelling- I don't have the book right in front of me.) But yes! This book is easy to read (in practically every way) The songs are easy to learn, as long as you are confident and okay with messing up on occasion. The CD is very helpful for when I need to practice and I don't have anybody to accompany me. Over all, I would totally recommend this book to any singer, or pianist."
1,Don't do it!,"Please don't buy this book. The editions are awful and completely out of date. I'm a full-time teacher of singing & I cringe when singers bring this in. Try ""28 Italian Songs"" edited by John Glen Paton. It has the same songs, but the editions are much better! Good luck."
4,good product,"If you have problem hands or fingers, or just lost you strength, get one of these for soda cans etc."
4,"for STARTING opening tab on can, only","Excellent to get tab away from can top, so can then grab by fingers to finish lifting. Does not lift tab very far, using just one hand, like myself. Holding onto can, tab opener can lift tab further. / thick durable plastic / Many cans today have pop-top, so keep one on your keychain for whenever needed ! WORTH HAVING ! (OPENER WAS $5 - SHIPPING WAS $6, for me) Such thick plastic, should never break ! Just include this opener in order over $25 and shipping will be free."
1,one opener is missing,I only got one tab opener on the card the other one was not there. The one I got works okay so far for what I got it for.
3,this is not what i expected,this is ok it really doesn't have too many critical questions that are that challenging.
4,"Am just starting to go through, but somethng to note...",You can find additional materials (audio for the dialogues) for this book on their website - [...]I'll update this review as I go through.
4,Heavenly chocolate.,"This stuff is really good. Too bad the Crunchy M&Ms; are no longer in sale because those deserve a 5/5 and are my favorite ones ever. The pure chocolate M&Ms; aren't as good as the Peanut ones, and the Peanut ones, although good, just don't compare to the Crunchies.Cover Art: BTaste: BLook (of M&Ms;): B (Oval goodness)Texture: C-4.3 stars.Overall: B-"
4,Bought for my sister.,I bought this for my sister who was battling ovarian cancer. She thought that it gave her good information about ovarian cancer and her illness
1,"Good for medical terminology, but not much else","I purchased this book believing that it was a complete, train-at-home package. I wish I would have known that the book must be used with audiocassettes which are sold on the publisher's website for $... Another huge problem is that the CD-ROM contains numerous errors on it's scoring key; so many correct responses are scored as incorrect. It is impossible for the user to get an accurate idea of their progress without manually scoring your own test by going back through the chapter and checking your own answers. Do not depend on the automatic scoring to tell you how you've done. I'm disappointed that the CD-ROM was not edited more carefully, and that the need for the audiocassettes isn't shared in the book description."
3,Average CD,"""It's not all bad""There are a few good thing and some bad things to tell about this CD.There are a few tracks of the CD (numbers 7, 8, 10 and 13) that are hard to come by. For all I know this is the only CD that has these numbers recorded if you compare it with the sheet music published by Hal Leonard. So thats a big plus.But the bad thing about this CD is that there is to much bass. It is also played a bit fast sometimes. For some-one who just likes the music, it's oke. But it bothers me as an musician.Overall a good CD if you have no knowledge of music (in a musician-way).May the force be with you!..."
5,Music to play by !,"My son is going through a phase of building Star Wars models, and loves to listen to this CD while building and playing with them. Being a professional musician, I was impressed with the quality of the recording and the orchestra. Well worth the price..."
2,Not worth it,"This comes with its own bag of rocks to tumble, but the assortment is quite lacking. Also, included is only enough ""grit"" material for one set of rocks."
5,A great deal for a great product,"My daughter received this rock tumbler as a gift and all of my children loved it - the finished product is really impressive if you have kids who like really shiny and very interesting rocks. She used them to make jewelry and she also gave several away as gifts. Yes, it is loud, but I've never known anyone who didn't keep their rock tumbler in the garage, my family included. The fact that it takes a long time to get the finished product is part of the learning experience; there are two stages to the polishing process and kids learn that it takes a lot of polishing to produce such a beautiful rock in the end. The Grand Canyon didn't erode in a day, right?! Give this rock tumbler a try and you won't be sorry!"
1,Buyer Beware!,"We bought this for our niece, who is very much into gems and stones. She was so excited when she opened it and wanted to get started right away. It was EXTREMELY unfortunate that the process would take SEVEN DAYS - and that's just to complete step one! The rocks have to tumble continuously in the tumbler for seven days - that's 168 hours of listening to rocks tumble around. Needless to say, her mother was LESS than pleased. They ended up shutting it off and never going back to it after just a day and a half. What a disappointment!"
3,My son begged for this...,"I read all the other reviews before purchasing this rock tumbler. Here is what I found out after it arrived:-Not as loud as I would have thought, but we put it to run in the kids room.-Has to run continuously for at least a week.-The rocks come out shiny, but also quite a bit smaller than when they started.-Somewhat messy due to the dirty water after the rocks have tumbled.-A neat idea, since its a hands-on toy for kids, but the waiting was challenging!I am not sure if I would buy it again, since the novelty wore off fairly quickly for my kids. But if your child is really into rocks and jewelry, it may be a great purchase."
3,Very Noisy,"I love the idea of a rock tumbler and the educational value of it. However, it takes a very long time to do (weeks) and lots of patience. Our home is fairly small and we couldn't stand the constant noise of the tumbler day in and day out. Finally after the first step (days) I had to call it quits. If you have a place where the noise wouldn't bother you and a lot of patience then you may like this toy."
1,This Program is Filled with Bugs,"Video Factory is filled with bugs and Sonic Foundry's support will not help you with the glitches or provide a patch. You will find that you will be doing some editing and find the frame rates dropping at the edit points. And that's with a pc that has double the required power. It all starts off great until you do some real editing and then all hell breaks loose. I found that the final video output was low in quality. I suspect that that is why this software is so cheap. I found that even Ulead, which comes free with many hardware products, is much better."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I tried this product because I do a lot of video editing. It is a good idea to use multiple products as even the best products can do them all. I found this product to be outdated and simply ""cheap"". If you want a professional quality software, go elsewhere. Just looking at the interface you will notice how cheaply done it is. The use of pan/crop tools to place logos over designs was a bad idea. This software is not user friendly and can be confusing. I have a lot of experience with video editing and this one even confused me. The product output, the most important factor in deciding, is second-rate. I have used other software at the same price that are much better than this. If you are a beginner at video editing, stay away from this junk. If you are a pro, you're better off with any other software out there."
5,best cd ever,the cd is so awesome...if your into wigging (xtc) then i highly recommend this....i listen to this cd all the time and love it...im also looking for another copy
5,This DJ is going to be BIG!,"If you want a CD that will make you feel good and get your energy level up, then this CD is just what the doctor ordered. I've followed this DJ (Frank Abraham) for quite sometime now and he always delivers a phenomenal performance. I own several of his Cd's and they all rock! TranceX is a must have. His other CD Circuit 2K is another phenomenal CD of his that I own. I don't know where he spins but if he comes to new york, I will definitely go out of my way to hear him play."
5,Quality recordings of unusual works,"The Eimer Trio have recorded the world's finest works for Clarinet, Violin and Piano. This unusual combination is rarely heard even though the music is wonderful. My favourite on the cd is the Katchaturian trio. This work was one of the composers early works written while he was still studying at the Moscow conservatorium. It posesses an unusual blend of armenian folk music and great russian classicism.This is a quality recording of great chamber music rarely heard."
2,"Good, but has issues...","These are clearly fine players who have captured the nuances of these fine works. However, I found the recording to be boomy--sounds like it was recorded in a barn. And at times the intonation is a little off. Nothing is too bad, but it sounds like they didn't get too many takes to create the perfect recording (which is the standard nowadays)."
5,Toddle Tots School Bus,"My 16 month old twins got the school bus for Christmas and haven't stopped playing with it yet. They love to put the people inside, along with every other small toy they have. I definately think that this toy is for one year olds and up. Three seems old. Also, the pieces are difficult to stick on the pegs but that doesn't seem to matter to my kids. They just throw them in willy nilly anyway. Not sure why there is a guy playing the saxophone either....kind of a strange choice."
3,My Review,The movie was okay. Both the actresses did a great job and I hope to see them both in other movies.
2,So boring.,"Beautiful scenery does not make up for a story that didn't capture me and characters I didn't want to watch. I expected to love this movie, and was left wondering why other reviewers had led me astray with their many stars."
4,LOVe it,"I really loved how the love that the two girls had for each other was real, like a genuine friendship. But the end is realistic even though its not the ending that alot of people would have wanted to see. But its a very realistic and lovely movie to watch."
3,Like dis-enchanted youth everywhere,"While well-acted and produced, I felt the story line was somewhat forced and a lot of the characters' lives were left unexplained. Perhaps this could be attributed to the oppressive government under which the film takes place (people disappear, raids ""just happen"", etc.) but a bit of artistic license would have been appreciated by this viewer to create a better narrative flow. I felt somewhat taken in because of our cultural inability to accept lesbian sex - this always seems to raise a film's cache unnecessarily. Likewise, oppressive regimes are nothing new and neither is disenchanted youth under those regimes. Definitely overrated by previous reviewers in my book - somewhat compelling but not particularly memorable."
1,False Picture,The film is in no way close to the situation in Iran. It pathetically tries to give an overly westernized picture of Iran and Iranian culture maybe to counterbalance the overly backwards picture common in the west. If that was a picture of Iran then I guess I've never lived in Iran. It was such a waste of time and money! I feel the director cheated me into paying the money. I am really sorry for her.
1,POOR QUALITY IN SOUND,"I followed the movie by watching and reading the subtitle but for the characters speaking you don't hear a thing.....the only thing you would hear is all the music booming in the background, cars passing by in the streets, and that's it..."
5,"Gorgeous film, painfully real","This was a beautifully filmed piece of art. Each scene was gorgeous to watch, and the unfolding love between these two women was portrayed in a realistic way. The story was not only moving but the film as a whole touches on extremely important political and social issues in Persian culture. Yet, it also transcends Persian culture as the theme of patriarchy is relevant everywhere. Heartbreaking and relevant - a must-see."
4,"Frustrated by location and culture, youths rebel","These Iranian teen girls adore each other and want to be together, but that just can't happen where they live, at least not openly, and especially not with the older brother of one girl spying on them at every turn. They are trapped by where they live and the culture they are stuck with. The Morality Police even break up the dances at their secret raves. This makes you appreciate living in the US even more."
3,"Close, but not quite","A ""close, but not quite"" kind of movie. I was completely taken with the two girls and their developing relationship but then more and more external forces came into play; each of which would have been a fine complication but cumulatively mired the film down and it eventually just sort of peters out instead of ending.Still, it's worth watching; well filmed, well acted, with insights into Iranian society and some very erotic moments."
5,Works well in my Samsung SCX-4200 printer,"This cartridge works well in my Samsung SCX-4200 printer. It was super-easy to change out and, as always, Amazon delivered it very quickly."
4,quirky book that I really enjoyed,"I thought Castling was a gread read...for anyone who enjoys, grows, or loves hemp, this is the book for you. It's got sex, aliens, environmentalism, and marijuana. Thoroughly enjoyable reading."
1,This Video [is bad],"I am probably one of the biggest sublime fans on this earth... I love them more then anything else on this world... But this video is terrible, i bought with excitement and watched it and was soo disappointed... the quality of the sound is TERRIBLE, and the quality of the guys playing the songs is the worst thing i have ever heard in my entire life... im extremely disappointed... they should have never released this... ...... ...... thats all i have to say"
1,Black and White and worse than youtube cell phone footage,"I got this as I have health issues and can no longer go to live shows. I buy many live DVD's from all the bands I like. It's usually almost as good as being there. Not in this case. The sound is awful. The video is awful. Not worth finishing watching. This DVD is worse than the cell phone footage of concerts, that people upload on youtube. I order these expensive DVDs because I want better quality than youtube. Paid over $30 and even $1 is too much for this junk. At least the crummy youtube phone footage is in color. To make this worse almost all that I watched was black and white and poor quality. Whether you are a fan or not, don't waste you money. Surely you can find something better that someone filmed on their phone and put on youtube."
2,Confusing And Buggy,What a disappointing piece of software. It is buggy and completely unintuitive. I'll be returning it.
1,Don't buy this Software,Man this company really stinks. I upgraded from 2004 hoping to get a better product but it has the same problems as before.Can you believe I can't automatically download transactions from my bank's site?Why else would you use this software then?Oh and Good luck easily moving from a previous version. every Version of Windows gets better but quicken is stuck in 1969.Really there must be something better. 10 years later and still buggy buggy buggy. I'm going to return this and use my old version. Heck with it. Did the same stuff and saves me $90.What other issues I haven't found???????I can't imagine all of the advanced features work for nothing nor would I want to spend 3 weeks figuring it out.Quicken Home & Business 2007
2,Sloooooooooooooooooooooooooow!,"Been using Quicken for years, and this is by far the worst version ever. On my 2GHz PC I can see the screen redrawing because of all the fancy stuff they are trying to do with the interface - stuff that BTW adds little value to the overall application. It's a total dog!I'd stick with the 2006 version if I had the opportunity to go back. Unfortunately now that I've upgraded I believe I'm stuck."
1,Quicken 2006/2007,"Well I have to say Quicken 2000 was working fine for me. Got 2006 Premier Home & Business for whatever I thought it would add for me. Practically nothing. The nice one-click reports section I had on the left side in 2000 is gone. Now I have to make multiple clicks to get the same thing (oh, you can put a up to 3 on the top bar but that's it - only 3 !!!). I've been using quicken since before version 3 in the late 80's or early 90's and now I believe their programmers are just cranking out whatever they think is an improvement even though it's not. I'm still testing 2006 after 3 months since I'm not about to quit 2000 without a thorough understanding of what 2006 gives me and takes away. Too bad, the 2007 interface looks a bit better than 2006 but with all the troubles I read about I think I'll wait 'till 2008 to see if they fix the bugs/problems they put in 2006/2007. Too bad, I was a quicken junkie until I saw 2006."
4,Quicken Received Quickly-Thanks,"I was desperate for this particular version of Quicken software and was delighted to get it so quickly and at such a reasonable price. I was slightly uneasy that the box was not sealed, but the product seems to be fine. If this page calls my comments a ""Kids Review"" (it did in the preview), that is incorrect. I am an adult over 60."
4,Very Helpful,"This product is very helpful, I haven't had any problems thus far and would recommend it to anyone who wants to stay up on finances."
1,The worst version ever - beware - don't upgrade,"I have been a long time user and have always had good success until the 2007.I have tried to install on my new PC and have not been successful. I called Intuit Phone support and spent and hour changing setting on my computer. We did the usual things for WinXP Pro:1. Set up a new account to verify it isn't a permission problem2. Shut off all service and switched to safe modeNone of these made a difference. So the Support Technician told me to call Microsoft and then hung up. That was it, no chance to even complain, just a dead phone line.Luckly, I know enough to put my PC back in working order but this is pretty lame support.I never though Microsoft would get me to switch and they haven't but Intuit has forced me off all on their own."
2,Quicken? Ugh!,"I gave up on Quicken almost 10 years ago. At that time, downloading was pretty buggy, and it required too much manual intervention, so I reverted to tracking stuff in a spreadsheet.I figured it was time to try again....Ugh! Buggy, slow, counterintuitive, and incomplete. I primarily wanted a consolidated view of my investments. Easy, right?No support for CD's. No support for savings bonds. Limited idea of asset classes.I've spent hours just trying to get things setup. I had to jump through weird hoops just to download all of my accounts from Vanguard -- an instituion one would think would be well supported.I plan to give this dog a little more of my time, and then I'll find a different way to torture myself."
4,Not a major upgrade but still the best!,"I resisted upgrading my 2004 version, especially after reading the reviews here. But the R4 release upgraded all by business, bank, and investment accounts without any problems.For business, the accountants would rather you use Quickbooks, but since mine is a simple service based business, I still refuse. Quicken works just fine and having everything in one place is just too valuable.It looks largely the same as 2004. But I was impressed by the online improvements, which is why the 2004 version is not longer supported. Now, it will automatically rename things the way you like. Since this eases the biggest problem of using software like Quicken, namely the discipline to enter and label everything, it a huge benefit.If you are looking to get control over your cashflow, and see the forest through the trees, this is the program. Learn it, know it, live it."
4,Good Buy,Target is a game that requires some strategy and some luck. We have played Phase 10 a lot and Target requires a little more thinking than Phase 10. We use it with our international students and it's good for building vocabulary and it also moves fast enough that people don't get bored. I think you'll find this game is worth the price and a good addition to your family game closet.
4,Very Helpful,"Corporate Conversations is an easy to read, concise look at how to write an internal communications plan. Most books like this are pedantic and academic, but this one is packed with solid advice that you can use immediately."
5,Wall Clock,This wall clock is cute and retro looking. Looks just like a neon license plate. The only drawback I have found is that the hands of the clock are black just like the background of the clock. It is very hard to tell the time because of that.
5,RADICAL TAMBO FOR THE PRICE,FAST SHIPPING! DECENT TAMBO! I WANTED A GREEN ONE THOUGH! THE GOONIES IS AN AWESOME MOVIE! RONALD RAEGAN WAS A BAD ACTOR! YOU SHOULD BUY ONE OF THESE THINGS AND USE IT IN A VOODOO CEREMONY!
1,Stopped Watching After 4 Minutes,"Once you've seen The Walking Dead, movies like this are merely amateurish. Amateurish. Amateurish. Amateurish. Amateurish. Amateurish. Amateurish. Amateurish. Amateurish. Whew! Met the minimum word count!"
5,"great music, average quality","track listing: Displaced Aggression, One By One, Hero, Head, Killing The Clowns, Secret"
5,Wonderful Christmas Story,A story you won't soon forget. Had the pleasure of hearing it several years back at womens fellowship meeting. I can't get the story off my mind. I'm one who believes angels are a big part of our lives. It captured my heart and I'm thankfull for Amazon because the book is no longer in print.It will be a part of our Christmas tradition for the rest of my life. Thanks Amazon!
5,A WONDERFUL READ WITH BEAUTIFUL ILLUSTRATIONS,"This beautifully written Christmas story captivates young and old readers alike. It has become a tradition for our family to read it every Christmas Eve (and throughout the year!). After only one reading of the book, it becomes a treasure. Thank you, Mr. LaRochelle, for this marvelous book."
4,A Great Book!,"I got this book for my 4 year old for Christmas. He's a dinosaur nut! He loves this book. The pictures are fantastic and there's a ton of information. Granted, he isn't ready for all the info in this book but it will grow with him and be useful for years to come. (Or until the scientists make new discoveries and all the info changes. ;) ) And to be honest, we got this book as much for us as him since he always asks questions and we were tired of never having the answers. It's a nice reference over all."
4,Fabulous pictures,My 3-year old is addicted to this dinosaur encylopedia. She is particularly facinated by the depictions of the carnivores.
3,Can't Believe I agree with Picture Comments,"I read the best review and worst. I'm shocked I agree with the worst review comments on picture layouts. I thought how bad could it be. I purchased to read to my 4 year old, we love it but I am so annoyed by the picture layouts I get distracted. You wouldn't think it makes a difference but it does. There are heads in the seams, center of picture key to the photo Cut off. It really is too bad. I love everything else and would still recommend it. If you read this and the other critiques you'll be prepared and not think you got a mis print."
5,Book Review - Dinosaurs,The book is absolutely excellent. We gave it to our grandchildren and they read it every day. Our grandson (only 4 1/2) is totally enthralled by the book. He practically has it memorized. We would recommend it to anyone interested in dinosaurs.
2,National Geographic Dinosaurs,"The information in the book is fabulous,but I was very disappointed in the condition of the book. The back cover was very wore and a bit dirty. The back cover was also torn away from the main body of the book. I will have to glue/tape the back cover before giving this to my son at Christmas. The description of the condition of the book was misleading, so I will never order from this particular vendor in North Carolina again. Last year I ordered a book at Christmas for my son and I was very pleasantly surprised ( different vendor ! ). This year given how the book looks, I will have to say that the gift was from ""us "" his parents instead of Santa Claus."
2,Poor quality video,"The quality of the picture was very poor. I had to play it at half size so it would not be blurred on a widescreen tv.That said, I thought the performances of the actors were good. Martin Sheen can always be relied on to give a first class performance. I would like to have gotten more insight into the children who witnessed the visions. The film does not explore deeply who they really were, what families they came from. The focus was on the priest. I would like to know what the children were told by the vision. This film is a good introduction to this fascinating topic and leaves me wanting more."
2,Wont work!,"I ordered this dvd a while ago and just last night got the chance to watch it--It would not play! We cannot figure out why it wont work in the DVD player (it's a ps3, but plays all of our other dvds...even the oldest ones!) I love Medjugorje and am waiting anxiously to go and be in this sacred place, so I was disappointed that I could not see the video...:( Don't know how to handle it from here as far as return goes..."
1,Sham,It is all about the priest and nothing about the seers - very disappointing. Misleading title - should be about the message from the Blessed Mother.
2,Very Disappointed,"I was so disappointed in this video I expected to learn more about the appearance of our lady and her message and its affect on the people, Instead this focused on the priest of the local parish and his troubles. Where was our lady's message? what happened with the Children? This was a typical cheap hollywood version and lacked all reverence to our lady. I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,miracle,"if you like martin sheen , you will like this movie... i wasn't to happy with it .. i thought it would be more on the miracle ,, instead of on the priest,,"
2,Very One-sided,"When I received this movie, I thought I was going to see something like ""The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima"" from 1952 directed by John Brahm. I was quite disappointed. This movie only briefly shows the children that saw the apparitions of our Blessed Lady. It is mostly about the trials and tribulations that the pastor of the parish went through with the Communist Government. Martin Sheen should be commended for a great performance as the tortured pastor. But since the title of the movie is the name that the people of that part of the world use to describe Mary, the Mother of Jesus, than why was it about the pastor and not about her appearances and about the children? This movie does not even touch on these miraculous apparitions. If you are looking to see a movie about the Marian apparitions in Medjugorje that are still going on to this day, this is not it. I am still looking.I DO NOT recommend this to anyone."
3,Medjugorje DVD,It was an interesting DVD which focused more on Fr Jozo.I would have liked to have seen more focus on the children as well as fr Jozo.but an interesting DVd .Worth watching especially for those who don't know the beginnings of the Medjugorje phenomena
3,There should be more films about these events,This DVD depicted the situation on the early 80's but it seems as some of the opinions are still the same and suddenly the movie became actual again. I think this movie is interesting for those who are concerned in a way or another.
1,Icing on a Dry Cake,"Before anyone even THINKS of buying this film, they should at first read books debunking this phenomenon and all the political and secretive factors behind it. One good source I would highly recommend to read is ""The Medjugorje Deception, Queen of Peace, Ethnic Cleansing, Ruined Lives."" by E. Michael Jones. This film is simply sweet icing over a cake that's stale or mildewed on the inside!"
1,Huge Hoax,"Medjugorje is a huge money-making industry based on a huge hoax orchestrated by the rebellious Franciscan priests in Mostar, some of whom have been stripped of their priestly faculties by the superior general of their religious order, and one of whom got a nun pregnant. See E Michael Jones's video ""Visions on Demand"" or his superb book, ""The Medjugorje Deception: Queen of Peace, Ethnic Cleansing, Ruined Lives"" at culturewars.com."
5,Yummy and healthy!,"I've been a subscriber of Cooking Light for several years now, and I always try to buy the annual cook book at the end of each year. These recipes produce dishes that are delicious, adventurous, and satisfying. I've not only learned alot about eating healthy foods by using these cookbooks, I've become a much better cook! Also, since the magazine has features on different ethnic cuisines, I've tried foods that I never would have made previously, with great success. Some of the recipes are more time-consuming than others, so make those on the weekend rather than during the week.Unlike other reviewers, I enjoy the recipes organized by month, because it helps me eat seasonally. That way, I buy produce that's in season, so it tastes better, and it's usually cheaper than buying products out of season. However, if one is looking for a specific recipe, consulting the index at the back of the cookbook provides a solution."
3,total confusion,While there is a whole years worth of recipes in one book it will probably take a year to find a particular recipe. The index is very confusing. Cooks will just end up frustrated.
2,Not the Original Artists!!!,"This has a really great selection of songs, but the only catch, the songs are NOT performed by the original artists."
4,Delicious,Great topping on rice. I first learned of this product years ago when my best friend's wife used this on her popcorn. It's been awhile since I had this seasoning and now I use it everytime on my rice. Love it!
4,awesome,lol its sweet really sweet and a little fishy but hey its seaweed I didn't care for it much but me mom and family wow the bottle didn't last a week lol . get it its a big bottle full to the top its about the same size as mcdonalds kids cup but its glass . gettem
5,Love this and no MSG!,"First time I had Furikake was in Hawaii with rice and an egg! It was so good! Then couldn't find it in the mainland and didn't know what brand I had in Hawaii. Finally found this brand,,,,all the basic ingredients and the most important thing, NO MSG!!! I highly recommend it."
1,strong fishy seaweed,"seaweed has a strong fishy odor, as seen in many imported Japanese products. Unfortunately, this purchase will be a wash."
1,$$$$,"Do you get a kiss when you buy this??? Go to your local Asian market and you will find high end Furikake for half the price. I just bought three, one nori, one wasabe and one salmon 2oz jars for a total of $6.99"
3,Overpriced,I was ordering this from Amazon because this Nori Komi Furikake is so expensive in the small town I have moved to. You only get one little jar for almost $10. Its only $6 overpriced dollars where I live! So if you think you are getting a deal- probably not unless you truly live in the boonies.
5,Spicing it Up Japanese Style,"I can't say enough good things about this line of Furikake rice seasoning! I've tried all of the different flavors, and there's not a bad one in the bunch. They really add perkiness to everything, and I find I use way less salt. Plus, the good news is there's no MSG, a biggie for mew!"
2,Very disapointing,"When i bought the book i thought i was going to discover at least a big part of the huge and extraordinary jesuit history. I was wrong. The book lacks too many names, countries, and facts related to the jesuit order. The author emphasises too much on certain people and ignores jesuit saints , politicians, and kings under the jesuit influence. I would also say that the authors sources are very , very scarce."
5,"Love Her or Hate Her, This is a Must See DVD","I watched this movie on Pay Per View. I wanted to learn more about this self made woman who has made such an impact in today's political arena.This documentary is well researched and presents Sarah Palin's past political career accomplishments in an objective view point.This documentary also focuses on the media malpractice that occurred when Sarah Palin was picked to be the VP candidate in 2008 for the GOP.Everyone should watch this movie and make their own informed opinions and impressions about Sarah Palin, rather than allow the media to form those impressions for you.I don't care if you are progressive, liberal, moderate, or conservative. Everyone needs to see what kind of strong, self made woman that America can produce. I found her story inspiring and I am encouraging all young women in particular to watch this DVD so they can see what possibilities there are for hard work and a determined will."
5,"Sarah Palin remains ""Undefeated""","Sarah Palin is the woman that most intelligent women admire. It drives the liberals CRAZY. How dare a girl grow up to be extraordinary when she is a Christian, middle class, athletic, attractive, talented, courageous, self-reliant and CONSERVATIVE? Her story should be an example of the well-rounded woman placed in the halls of feminism. Do I admire her? You betcha!This film tells the story of the comfortable-in-her-own-skin Palin during her Vice-Presidential campaign with John McCain in 2008. Using documented videos, interviews and factual events, one can see Palin minus op-eds of the minions on the left. As a conservative woman, I applaud her for standing her ground, and keeping her courage under fire. Buy the DVD and support conservatives."
2,funny,"I saw it. Propaganda like everyone else. But look at all the titles of the review. All the headlines are fake. Really, awe-inspiring....nobody says that."
1,Misleading title,"Not to be a pendant, but she was defeated. Defeated handily and thoroughly. It's nice that she doesn't feel that way, but it doesn't change the facts."
1,Trash,Watched a few minutes of this at a friend's home. Had to excuse myself at not quite half-way through it.Waste of time.
1,Worse than a bad case of diarrhea,"Some time ago, I had a really bad case of diarrhea. I thought that after I flushed the toilet, it would be gone forever. Little did I know that Sarah Palin and her handlers were siphoning from the sewage pipes of Los Angeles County and repackaging it into a 'documentary.'Leni Riefenstahl couldn't have made a film with more right-wing propaganda than this piece of garbage."
1,Rubbish,"This is a woman who believes in witches! And chosen to potentially be Vice President?! She's just ill-educated trailer trash that makes her money from the cult of celebrity, the thing she hated when she was on the ticket with McCain. Hypocrite? It would be laughable if she wasn't so dangerous."
1,Worst documentary ever,"Save your money. Basically one long Sarah-vertisement that doesn't give you anything you haven't heard before, with tons of propoganda and spin. The woman is a train-wreck and anyone who can think for themselves will smell the spin-doctoring from a mile away."
5,Undefeated,Definitely sets the record straight about the history and accomplishments of this true American Patriot. A must see for any voter of any Party.
5,Refreshing Honesty and American Values Instead of Hollywood Smut!,"This was an inspiring movie and Sarah Palin connects with people because she is real! She is a strong, intelligent (photographic memory- she doesn't need a teleprompter) classy lady who cares about God, Family and Country! Which is why liberals hate her! She gives new meaning to feminist since she's not a man-hater, a baby killer, or ugly! We love Sarah and the rabid liberal-biased media just makes us laugh, they are so desperate!"
2,Disappointed reader,I bought this book primarily for information regarding accounting and general ledger systems. I read all the great reviews here and thought this would be a great book. I am very disappointed. The entire section on accounting is only 40 pages and contains only a cursory overview of accounting systems and structures. They include a CD with the book which is supposed to contain actual SQL data structures but you have to pay them $350.00 to unlock the CD. Given the depth of the book I would be reluctant to risk paying them that much for simple data structures which you can easily find elsewhere on the web for free.In all honesty I have not studied this book fully but in my opinion it was a waste of money and I will try to return it to Amazon.
2,Two surprises I didn't like,"The text of this book was generally good - although it seemed padded out with a massive listing of model metadata. The book comes with a CD. The first surprise was, the CD does not include the Data Definition Language (DDL) for its sample models... there's an extra cost for that. My question to the publisher would be, what good is the CD you provide for free?The second surprise is the illustrations. There are plenty of them, but they look like they were done in a primitive graphics package - not in an enterprise modeling tool. They author seems to have invented his own wierd set of conventions, including ""foreign keys do not appear in the entities... that is duplicate information"". Before you buy this book, take a look at the illustrations of the models. If you can live with the notation, maybe consider buying it."
2,Yawn! Boring and unhelpful,"I'm a programmer with a DBA background, so I thought that this book would be an easy read to improve my data architecture models. It is not. Rather, this book is mostly repetitive jargon that almost seems like it was written by someone who has never managed an enterprise database. In short, this book is the sociology of psychology or the political science of statistics. Lots of jargon and very little application. On a positive note, this book has helped me to fall asleep quicker after a late night."
2,Dashed Expectations,"I'm a seasoned data modeler and was hoping I'd found a book to use for quickly training new members of my team. I was very disappointed. The data models presented in this book are so generic that they are useless to all but the most inexperienced data modeler, and even that usefullness is questionable. It's a great idea-- compiling a book of reuseable data models from various industries and subject areas-- but this book misses the target, badly. Let's hope for a better 3rd edition."
3,1999 Escort 2.0L DOHC,"This book is very informative. However, as a previous review has mentioned, detail on the 2.0L 1999 engine is lacking. Detailed images are few and some are replaced with drawings making repair of the 2.0L 1999 vehicle difficult."
2,"Slowish, White LEDs bright and distracting","OK, to be fair, I've only had it a day. The backup software is so-so, the drive is kinda slow and the LEDs that show functioning of the drive are totally distracting in anything other than a brightly lighted room.Everything about it seems a bit clunky, so I am only going to use it for weekly backups and still put all my images and data on Gold CDRs until I can afford a proper RAID.At least it is quiet...Bought it very cheap as a tool to migrate from XP to Vista, so if it dies in a short period, it will have served its purpose..."
3,Real Life Fairy Tale,"This is a pleasant book that I bought because the cover attracted me; it looked like the type of cover that might have been on an old Trixie Belden book from years gone by. I liked the girls well enough and was relieved that this was not yet another abused child or fantasy story; there seems to be such a glut of them on the market right now! On the other hand, the entire Callahan series is like a real-life fairy tale because despite their little emotional problems, these kids have such a great life! They never want for anything; they either have the spending money or their grandmother buys it for them. They have no chores to do and their grandmother even has a friendly housekeeper who makes delicious dishes and cookies. It's friendly and fun."
5,phone battery,i HAVE AN OLD CORDLESS PANASONIC TWO LINE PHONE. I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND ALOT OF MONEY FOR NEW BATTERIES SO I TRIED THESE BATTERIES. THE PRICE IS RIGHT AND THE BATTERIES WORK.
1,Not plug compatible with P-P511 batteries,"These batteries did not work for me in the Panasonic KX-TG2770. They are just slightly bigger than the original Panasonic battery. I had to force one into the phone. Once in, the battery would not charge. Then could not remove it without prying it out with a screw driver. Thinking maybe the 2nd battery might charge, or maybe my handset was broken, I wanted to try the other battery. I could not even force it into the phone. After hundreds of purchases from Amazon, this is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review. I would give this item zero stars but the lowest rating possible is one star."
3,Portable phone batteries,"The phone batteries arrived when expected. I ordered 4 batteries, but only 3 out of the 4 hold a charge. The other one just won't charge at all. So we've got 75% success. However, it is more cost and trouble than it is worth to try to get a replacement for the bad one."
5,Exactly what I expected,"Delivered quickly; price was right, and I get to keep a set of ancient phones happy. (PS I put a piece of tape with the date changed on the battery. My last set gave good service. These should, too. I've had these phones for more than a decade.)"
5,A Catherine Palmer Classic,"Catherine Palmer's great skill as a writer shines through in this wonderful book. The attraction between Mara and Brock is palpable but their past hurts and fears keep them apart. Can Mara and Brock let go of their bitterness and anger and let God work in their lives? I couldn't put this book down! If you liked The Kiss of Adventure series, you'll love this book as well."
4,Love's Haven,I enjoyed the book. It was moving and thoughtful. It's a tender story of love and security.
2,Not Palmer's best,"This book seems like an excuse for the author to write an average romance in an unrealistic setting. Basics: husband of pregnant woman dies and she blames the best friend, who is now offering her marriage out of guilt to cover her husbands debt build-up and health care and security for her unborn child. The two main characters hate each other, yet she marries him anyway. That is the setup for these two to ""fall in love."" The romance, the friends, even the so-called forgiveness all seemed so forced; it often made me cringe. The only reason I finished the book is because I was bored, and I breathed a sigh of relief when I closed the book. I turned right around and returned it for my money back. I was highly disappointed with Palmer and this book, because she's written some amazing books, some worth five stars. But this isn't one of them."
3,All Grown Up,"I got this game yesterday. It was pretty fun and durable. However, at one time in the game, [almost] all of the characters always ask for a volleyball, then, once you find the ball, the characters always want to play with it, so you end up playing volleyball over and over again. Also, all the websites that I've looked at show this one screenshot where you can pick outfits, but I can't seem to find it in the game. To say something good about the All Grown Up game, the minigames are pretty fun and it is fun to custamize the backround and the music (although the music can get quite annoying)."
3,Lots of good info but tough to read,"I'm getting some good stuff from this book but there are a significant number of things that don't make sense or seem contradictory. I'm thinking that some of the author's intent has been lost in translation. I still feel it is valuable, but tough to read. I am a physical therapist. It may be harder to read for novice exercise enthusiasts"
3,buny-in-the-headlights,"no, the acting isn't great; and yes, the story could have been fleshed out a bit more but i think that what you get is a fairly accurate portrayal of an iconic personality in film history. no complaints from me, as i enjoyed the movie on its' merits"
1,Lousy Product,"This is not a commercial DVD but a made-to-order product, and the quality is rotten. This is the worst product I have ever received from Amazon. Let my sad experience with this ruined-sound no-picture product be your guide. Unlike my own purchase of this lemon, you at least have been warned.Cooley/SF"
3,"Nuryev, nuff said!","Never got to see him speak, but what a gorgeous talented dancer (tho nothing compared to Barishnikov) and have no clue what really happened to the poor guy but was fascinated with this portrayal. The direction was simply awful but the high notes were rare but worth the wait. Worst fake O I ever saw, tell her to watch Meg Ryan paleeze!! Emotional roller coaster between passion, sympathy, disgust, and well passion... I want to watch it many more times but be patient, hopefully I missed alot of nuance while laser focused on Rudy!"
5,"Cheap prices, but still a good working cable!","Not to much to say really. You see the prices, there not bad (way better then Walmart or Best Buy) and the cable works just a well as the ones you would buy in the fancy packaging at the stores."
1,Oh my God!,This book is a waste of the paper it was written on. I can't believe someone would even publish this crap. My 5 year old comes home from Kindergarten with better written stories than this. I kept waiting to get to the part about a couple of hunting buddies coming out of the woods and seeing some deer and one of them took a pop shot by aiming toward the sky with his bow and low and behold he killed him and spotted fawn and was proud of it. Kinda bummed out they left that story out.
5,Humorous and complex!,"This is a wonderful Rider-Waite-style deck which combines wit and fun with serious symbolism and a deep understanding of the Tarot. I see something new (either a joke or a piece of esoteric symbolism) every time I use my copy. It might not be the best deck for absolute beginners, since it is actually very complex, and be sure not to use it around the Tarot/Occult-nervous people in your life (the suit of Imps will have people of that sort running from the room screaming ""Satan worship!"" in a heartbeat). Also, the very fact that so many images *are* humorous may make people unfamiliar with the Tarot disrespect the deck without understanding that something can be funny *and* serious at the same time. Still, for someone (like me) who loves Halloween, black cats, the Tarot, and humor combining all three will love this deck. What's not to like about a Major Arcana where The Devil really *is* wearing a blue dress?"
4,Another laugh-out-loud book by Keenan,"This is a great follow up to Blue Heaven, which should be read first since they refer to some scenes in this book. The same cast of zany characters come to life again here, in equally as insane scenarios. Similar character acts comparison: Lucy and Ethel."
4,Helpful Private School Resource Guide,"I found this book to be a very vital tool in my search for just the right school for my child. The author's introduction in the book enlightens you with info you might not otherwise consider in hunting for a school. Furthermore, the questionairs that the author provided each school to complete for inclusion in the book enables you to compare apples to apples so to speak. I was able to pick and choose which school met the criteria I was after without even leaving my home. Further, web sites are included for most of the schools, enabling you to tour some of the schools to learn yet more about them. This book focuses primarily on schools in the West Bay area. I hope that the author will consider doing a similar one focusing on schools in the East Bay area. I plan to pass my book on to family for their use when considering schools for their children."
4,Great telling of myth,"If you can read translated myths then you can read this book. That statement is a warning as this book is not an easy read, but it is a worthwhile read. The book IS NOT fantesy, as fantesy is completely created by the author. Rather this book is a retelling of the existing myth. I find it interesting that what seems to be the downfall of many a hero, is that they forget to worship the old gods. Effectively a mythological warning."
2,hard to read,I found it hard to read and understand. A lot of names not defined who is the protagonist. Its certainly not written as a modern- common-novel but in the vein of old sagas.
5,what's in a Name?,"Acquiring and reading several books on Viking History was started several years ago by an oral lecture reference of ""Rolf Krecke"" which is our family last name of Northern German origin appearing in ""The Saga of Hrolf KRAKI"" and many other references to this ancient Danish Viking King! Our ancestor? Probably not but fun to fantacise! So this launched a new hobby of reading many wonderful Viking histories and Sagas as can be seen in a list of my Amazon book purchases."
4,An amazing story of love and persistence!,"I read this book as I was readying for a trip to Vietnam and Cambodia. Although I did not visit Hue, I was in Central Vietnam. This book gave me a great perspective on the culture and people so that I could relate better to my environs during my travels. I would love to read more by Sullivan as in addition to his story being wonderful, his ability to write is beautiful."
4,My son LOVED this toy,"Yes it is noisy, but my active son LOVED this train for about a year when he was two years old. He would play with it for hours. In fact, it was always on in our home! Our train would make some movement on any surface, and he just would follow it around help it get unstuck. The musical aspect was never the most important part to him. He liked that it moved around, and that he could turn it on or off by the smokestack. He did pull off the band that helps the traction, but he didn't care - he would just watch it go in circles. His cousin, a true Thomas fanatic, did NOT like this train the way my son did, so we inherited it. My son does not know much about Thomas, but enjoyed this toy. I recommend it for active children who love trains and things that move by themselves."
2,So unworth it,"I got this for my kids because they love music and love Thomas. What a waste. After about a day or two of use, the music went from shrill and loud, to virtually nonexistant. I guess a blessing in disguise, but dissappointing none-the-less. Second fault, it chugs around in random circles, running into EVERYTHING and then getting stuck. It drives my 15 month old (and me) nutty. Who has a football stadium-sized room big enough for this thing to run unencumbered? Sheesh."
1,A noisy boring toy,"I bought this for my two-year old daughter who loves Thomas. But she does not like this toy. It plays annoying calliope music. The popular children's tunes are barely recognizable. The engine has very weak power and gets stuck on seams in the floor. It does however, make a fabulous bookend!"
1,BORING TOY,"This toy comes with little "" records"" and theyre sharp! i have stepped on them a few times and actually have bled...otherwise this toy is totaly boring. My son doesnt use the records at all after I stepped on them. sometimes he picks the thomas up but gets mad when the eyes arent opened. It does not go on rugs. and the music never played clearly. i wouldnt advise purchasing this."
1,This toy is a dud. Thomas the Terrible Toy.,"This toy is a dud. Why? It does not run on carpet, is very loud mechanically and my 2 year old has never shown much interest in it."
2,Not great if you don't know what you want.,"I found the book to be alright in terms of it teaching the fundamentals of how to construct different types of fences, but in reality, some of the types of fences discussed are not all that practical (i.e., stone and brick fences).If you are merely looking for numerous ideas for one style of fence (i.e., picket fence), you are better off looking elsewhere."
4,Good book,"This a good basic introduction. Also try Interest Rate Risk Modeling: A Fixed Income Valuation Course by Nawalkha et. al, and the website www.fixedincomerisk.com with a free forum and free software download."
3,More helpful for self-improvement than for leadership expansion,"This book guides you to explore your own value, goal, emotion and helps you to align and communicate them. But I donot see a huge impact on the leadership skills."
2,"Wish there wasn't an ""... also bought this..."" list","This is one of the rare occassions where the otherwise usefull recommendations list ""Customers who bought this, also bought..."" does not work. Linthicum just did a search and replace on his previous book (Enterprise Application Integration) and replaced EAI by B2B. This book ( or its 4 relevant chapters ) should really be an addendum to his previous book.What is missing is the application of B2B integration : why , where and when ( e-marketplaces , private marketplaces , supply chain management )Missing concepts : change management , organisational impact , business partner adoption , security issues , comparison of vendors , characteristics of B2B integration tools , non-intrusive or standards based dilemma etc..My advice : if you own Enterprise Application Integration , do NOT buy this book."
1,Avoid Linthicum like the plague,"Not only can't he write, he can't even post reviews of his own books anonymously. And what does he man by ""My copy already appears a bit raged out""?"
3,"A campaign setting, set in Forgotten Realms mysterious past.","I don't know if I liked this campaign expansion or not. The good points are it is an good setting, with some fun and interesting new rules. The bad part is the over all lack of focus. This campaign setting forces DM's to simply pick a year they want their Netheril campaign to take place. Oh but there is only about 3520 + years of history to pick from. Also for $25 it seemed a little pricey coming with only two maps (Well done maps BTW), and a source book. Over all slightly better than average, but you might want to think before buying. I should have."
3,Netheril Review,"I have this boxed set, and a considerible amount of other Forgotten Realms boxed-sets as well. They don't seem to give you enough important information and data in it, and seem to be really vague. The idea of the game is great and everything, I just wish they could have been a bit more precise. The maps are wonderful along with everything else... I just wish that they would have stayed on one path and gone with it."
2,Quicken's not for Dummies,"I bought this thinking it would solve all of my financial worries. Well, I have yet to figure out how it works. I've gone through it a bit but unless you've used this product in the past, there is a huge learning curve. I may have to find a class to teach me how to use it."
4,Does what it's supposed to do,Very user friendly. Easy to set up and the widget is a cool little add-on. Definitely worth it.
1,Sounds like it doesn't even deserve the one star we're forced to give it.....,The reviews were very helpful. I will not support a company that rips people off based on greed!
1,Caveat Emptor,"I have been using Quicken for 12 years and cant live without it. Switching to Apple has been a pleasure for computing except that Quicken is a NIGHTMARE. Intuit is late to the Apple party and has clearly written off or cannot fix the 3% of sales that go to Apple users. This product is IMPOSSIBLE if you have complex tax information or expect to use this program for capital gains calculations or anything other than balancing a checkbook. If you need info or transactions from years before, NIGHTMARE.You end up either using the windows version (buy windows OS again, since you cant use OEM versions on your new MAC, buy parallels or bootcamp) just to run Quicken on your MAC, OR you have to have a windows computer just for Quicken. Shame on you INTUIT for even pretending that you have a decent product for MAC."
2,Widget Good...The Rest Bad,"Quickbooks Windows users have been able to print deposit slips for the LONGEST time, but yet again this version does not allow for printable deposit slips. This may seem trite, but for a Mac business owner, printable deposit slips would make my life a lot easier. The widget seems like a nice addition, but not for $50+ dollars. I think the only way I would purchase this item was if Citibank finally gave in and supported the Mac version."
1,Quicken for MAC/Poor Support,"The support is a disaster for Macintosh versions of Quicken (and probably PC versions, too); the product itself is alright (perhaps 3 stars) butwhen a glitch occurs, get your credit card out for the Bombay, India support; better yet call the headquarters in Mt. View, California and ask the president's office for U.S. support!!! (They have some). Intuit/Quicken management's insulting decision to force their U.S. ""bread and butter""customers to flounder with inferior out-sourced foreign support overrides any other poor decisions and deserves one star only!!"
1,"Sad to say, but buy Microsoft Money instead","Had been using MS Money on a PC for 10 years then bought a Mac. Didn't want to contaminate my mac with MS software so bought Quicken. Bad choice. Found it very confusing especially the bill pay part. Maybe I didn't give it enough time (1 month) or read any instructions (I didn't read any for MS Money), but I eventually bought Parallels so I could reinstall MS Money. Back to paying bills and doing all my financial things just fine. If you are recent PC to Mac convert think again about Quicken."
4,Better than most think,"I was wary of trying this when I saw all of the bad reviews, but after buying and using it for 4 months, I don't regret purchasing it. True, it seems a little disjointed, but once you remember that you use the program by using the top menu bar and do your navigation that way and through the little windows on the screen, one gets used to it. But remember, this software wasn't written for Leopard. I had no problem what so ever using it."
3,"It works, but...","I was tempted to give this one star because it's so inferior to the PC version. On the other hand, I'd probably give four stars if this were the only version I were familiar with. I use it daily and don't have any problem with it except a few minor functions don't work as they should. I have not been successful in deleting or renaming accounts after changing credit cards. So- I just remember to enter my Visa card activity into the account into what used to be my Discover card account. It's a minor annoyance.This program is clearly not as good as the PC version, but it's still better than not keeping track of your finances."
1,Bummer,"I love TurboTax, and I had good experiences with Quicken for PCs. Quicken for Mac is a huge disappointment. Not at all intuitive, not at all easy, and not at all efficient. I think I'm heading for iBank."
3,Quicken 07 Needs More Work,"Quicken 2006 did not work as well as it should and I got tired of waiting for the 2010 Version. So, I purchased Quicken 2007. i should have saved my money. I can't even register this product. I have used Quicken for years and love it but the people at Intuit need to get their act together. I was ready to buy the 2010 version but it will not track investments."
2,shippiing took a long time,Took amazon a week and half to ship me the box. linking the software with B of A cost me 10 dollars a month. the UI looks dated and there's no printed menus. But it kinda works
1,Rated 1 star because I can't choose 0 stars.,The ONLY thing that is good about this product is that it is for Mac and not PC. It is far inferior to the PC version. The Quicken re-write for Mac better be worth the wait.
2,A Rose by any other name,"The massive instructions on how to convert Quicken for PC files to work with Quicken for Mac should have scared me away, but they didn't. Don't plan on transferring data files from PC to Mac. After hours of converting financial entries, Quicken created category files and my account names that are too long for Q Mac, etc. it still failed. Turns out splits in my wife's paycheck didn't transfer correctly along with other things. Bottom line I've loved Quicken on the PC and wanted to keeping using it on my Mac, however I guess without stating over that ain't going to happen! If intuit isn't going to make these two products compatible, then they shouldn't give them the same name."
2,Worst Customer Service Ever,"It works. Overpriced, underdeveloped (two years behind schedule), quirky user interface, and the worst--I mean ""the worst""--customer service and technical support of any large software developer. Be prepared for being cut off, sent to the wrong department, and transfered to nonexistent phone numbers. Why? No competition."
1,Don't buy it!,"This product has a serious bug. When you type in a date, the software inserts the numeral 5 in place of the usual delimiters, i.e. /. It will not print reports or in some cases allow data to be written in because of ""invalid date"". Do not buy this product."
3,Always questions,"I purchased Quicken 2007 for Mac. I have tried to reconcile 2 different checking Accounts and found that some items that were ""checked"" as being reconciled do not appear with an ""R"" when the Check Register is printed. These items were definitely checked in the Register,I am not confident that these items will show up in future reconciliations of the (two Accounts).What can be done to correct this situation??"
2,Not the Quicken I know,Seems like a short shift version for Mac. Does not function or feel like the PC version.
4,"Not Great, But...","Having been a long-time Windows Quicken user, it seemed only natural to purchase Quicken Mac 2007 when switching from Windows to Mac. I have to admit that it doesn't look like Intuit put much thought into this product. It does not look or act much like most any other Mac application, however, it does get the job done and without too much hassle. I understand they are working on a new, more Mac-friendly, version to be released in late '08 and I look forward to seeing it."
1,Really bad product. Bugs. Poor Design. Not Mac Friendly.,"It's as if the designers of this program have never used a mac. This is not intuitive compared to the windows version. All the accounts are clumped together. Worse of all, however, is that it crashes all the time and good luck trying to reload -- sometimes it just won't and if you haven't backed up an older file, you have lost everything. Quicken dumped their worst designers on Mac users for this one."
1,"Please, someone make better finance software for the Mac!!!","Quicken is fine for very basic finances. My beef is that it could be so much better. Especially for tracking of investments. It is not at all intuitive, and is wanting for so many features. Overall, the software could do much better in terms of options for reports and graphs. Finally, every year they have the opportunity to improve the software and every year without fail the improvements are basically NOTHING. There are many of us out here...I wish some company would try and compete with intuit as they have dropped the ball here. probably because they have no incentive to do any better. Apple? microsoft? someone? please?"
2,Not much of a change for a Mac user,If you own an older version for Mac don't waste your money buying the newer version.This version is not much different from the '04 version.
1,Very poor support for Mac - don't buy it,"Intuit charges banks extra to support Mac users, and many banks don't pay. So the convenience of automated transaction downloads is impossible for me on Quicken Mac. Several other features are lagging behind the Windows version. And for some inexplicable reason, transferring data between Quicken for Windows and Quicken for Mac isn't complete or straightfoward.I haven't used competing products, but for Mac users I recommend either running the Windows Quicken version (using Boot Camp or Parallels) or buying another product. And by all means, let Intuit know that their pricing practices are costing them customers."
1,Not worth the upgrade,"The ONLY reason I upgrade is because of the loss of online support after so many years. There is no major improvements and running on Intel Mac is a new set of problems. After Apple made Quicken the company it is, they left Apple to rot with Quick Books. Try MYOB they supported Mac when Quicken left the building."
1,Terrible,Don't be tricked into getting this program. It is terrible. It doesn't even work to connect with banks to download transactions. I would never use Quicken again. It is NOT user friendly.
1,Very disappointed,"We had been using Quicken on my wife's PC laptop. When that laptop died a death, we decided to move our finances to my Mac. Part of the problem is that the interface simply doesn't look as professional as it did on the PC. I could get past that, except that the program seems to crash at least once a session. I've only been using it for a few weeks and am still trying to see if I can figure out the cause for the crashes. But, so far, it's been a pretty frustrating program."
1,"Bulky, intrusive, annoying, doesn't help make a budget at all...","In short... not worth a penny. It is pretty much a fancy-packaged transaction log. The budgeting portion of the program is unwieldy, and requires a lot more effort than it really should. There's nothing Quicken tells me that my bank statements don't already. Wouldn't buy again, ever."
1,Prefer PC version,So far I hate Quicken for MAc. After years being a devoted Quicken user on my PC I bought an iMac and switched to This. I can't get any accounts to download to my register like I did with the PC version. Should have stayed with the PC.
1,Does not support my bank,"I'd read all the awful reviews. I knew better. I tried it anyway, hoping that since I wasn't trying to import any old files, but rather start over from scratch, this would be at least useable.It wasn't.I couldn't even get started. Quicken 2007 Mac doesn't recognize my bank, Bank of America Military Bank, even though it recognizes the parent institution. Even though BoA Military has ""quicken"" in its export options.Useless."
3,You can get a free product online that is easier to use,This does not have good instructions and is not very user friendly. I went online and got signed up for Quicken Online which is FREE. THat product gives you instructions and is very intuitive. I wish I knew about the website before I bought the product as I would not have spent the money.....
1,Quicken 2007 for MAC,"Do NOT buy this software. I am in the process of swiching from a PC to a MAC computer. I have used Quicken for years on my PC and loved it. So naturally I bought Quicken for MAC thinking it would be a no-brainer. Well it has been a nightmare. I don't even know where to begin. I finally gave up after several weeks and asked for my money back. I was told by a guy in New Delhi, India that the amount I paid would be refunded to my account so we'll see. Now I am using two computers so I can still have my Quicken on the PC!"
1,Does Not Work Like PC Version,This is a poor substitute for the PC version. I just switched from PC to IMac and am sorely disappointed in this product. The main problem is that there is no way to change the size of viewed fonts on the register. It makes the program vitually worthless. The trouble is there is no other acceptable home checkbook software for Mac.
1,$129.99 for a 5 year old Quicken?,"I have been running Quicken 2006... since 2006. The reviews for Quicken 2007 were so poor, I decided to wait until the price was low. It is 2012 and the price for a 5 year old, badly reviewed, never upgraded from 2007 product... is $129.99?Why hasn't someone seen this market and jumped in? iBank is the closest I can find to Quicken 2006 and it is woefully lacking in so many features. I can't upgrade to Lion and bring Quicken 2006 along. So I am stuck with Leopard (not a bad deal for now) and Quicken 2006. I refuse to pay that much for an old, poor product.Intuit still gives Mac the short end. They have recently pledged to remedy this, but I have heard that song before. Impress me, Intuit. I dare you."
1,very poorly developed product,"The only reason I bought this couple of years ago because there was no other such product on mac. Extreme disappointment.Since there are lot of reviews on this I am just going to highlight points which I didn't see anywhere else1. Spreadsheet like interface. Quite clumsy to use.2. Stores previous transaction information, auto-populates it but doesn't give option to clean up history. So first time I bought gas in Shell and categorized as vacation/gas. Now all shell transactions are pre-categorized as vacation.3. Look and feel are poor. Very similar to 20 year old software on macs.4. very few meaningful built in reports.5. They didn't even bother to copy features from quicken windows."
4,Does the job,Quicken Personal Finances 2007 for MacI upgraded to this version because of hard drive failure. This performs well for my use. I use it primarily to track and balance my check book. It does the job well.
2,Really confusing for keeping track of investments,"I upgraded to Quicken 2007 a while back to keep track of new investments and IRAs, 401(k)s, and so forth. I had been using Quicken for a few years already to keep track of credit cards, budgeting, and savings and checking accounts, and I was hoping that this version would help with more advanced investing options. I am completely confused, as the data Quicken comes up with is incorrect from the actual balances of my investments, and gets progressively worse over time. I probably didn't set it up correctly, but I've wasted a lot of time on this product and it isn't worth the time to figure it out."
1,This program is awful.,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. As a new Mac user I was looking forward to moving my Quicken data from windows to mac. As a Quicken user of many years I thought the move would be easy. This program is awful. It is not at all intuitive. The sorting doesn't work. The data had to be saved in a new format within windows before exporting to mac vs converting it upon installation. I think I'm going to use the windows partition (in Parallels) and use the windows version. This program is less than useless.
1,Attention Mac Users,"For the love all that is good in this world...run, do not walk, RUN away from this software. Where should you run to? A copy of parallels, VM ware, or bootcamp and get the windows version of this program. Since switching to the mac I have been frustrated with this ""software"". It had been sometime since I had used personal financial software and the first time on a mac. I thought man....this program seems worst than my 2002 version on windows. After trying the usual suspects, liquid ledger, ibank, icash etc. I went to the windows 2008 version of quicken via parallels. Oh my god! the feature set is night and day. The windows version has about 15 essential features that the mac shows no signs of ever attempting.Until Intuit gets serious about the mac version stay away from this nonsense."
1,Extremely slow,I switched from Quicken 2005 to 2007 and it's a real dog - entering transactions (on a Mac Pro) spins the color wheel for ~10 seconds per transaction.
1,No customization like in the PC version,"First of all, the font sizes on a 17"" high resolution screen are so tiny they are almost unreadable. Unlike the PC version, you have no control over font size, register color, etc. The small font size make the product unusable in my opinion. I shouldn't have to change my monitor resolution just to use the program. It should be able to run in a 1440 X 900 resolution with fonts that are big enough to see. I have requested a refund."
1,Do not waste your money...,"This software is not intuitive or easy to use. I've used MSMoney 2007 and am quite happy with it. I have used MSMoney for years in various reincarnations, but purchased this one for my significant other to use because she truly believes Mac's to be superior. Well, she stopped using the software after having it for 2 weeks because it was not easy to use.... So I'd recommend saving your money and managing it in some other manner."
1,"They ""lost"" me at The incompatible file-formats","Someone please explain to me WHY Quicken for Mac 2007 uses an incompatible file-format to Quicken 2007 for Windows. Now, it would be one thing if I could open the windows quicken file from Windows and then had to save as quicken format. Oh no, that would be too logical. No, I have to go into quicken for windows and EXPORT EACH account one-by-one?????UNACCEPTABLE!!! My god, even MS isn't this bad. Imagine if you had an excel spreadsheet in windows with multiple sheets and the only way to get it into Excel for Mac was to ""export"" each sheet individually and re-import into the mac version. That's exactly what Intuit has done here.File structure/format is NOT system dependant and they should have given a bit more care to this one. In the end there is no good way to migrate your data properly between OS's.I promptly got a refund and will be using Quicken for Windows in Parallels for now."
3,Quciken from Win to Mac,"After using Quicken for Win for more than a decade the Mac version is disappointing. I have gotten used to it, after much effort, but I do not understand why it is missing some of the functionality. I think the Quicken team should be embarrassed about the difficulty of moving from Windows to Mac. I never did get it right. I highly recommend following the suggestion on the Quicken site but even then it is a painful process.If you are starting from scratch on the Mac this version should be fine. I am becoming more accustomed to it. It certainly handles the basic checking and savings just fine. I miss the attachments function. My loan accounts did not port over. The reports are better in Windows. Some of the investment functionality seems to be missing, though my basic brokerage account works fine.In the end this seems to be the only option for the Mac anyway so I guess the Quicken folks can be neglectful."
1,bad,Setting it up on my mac has been nearly impossible and I still can't get it to work correctly or efficiently- Transferring the previous programs over from the old mac has been even more troublesomenot recommended for the common folk
3,GOOD ENOUGH,It is good enough for control of your personal finances. Unfortunately MAC users does not have many other options. It is not as good as the version for PC and it takes time to understand the program.
1,Suckers,"Really, I should be nicer to all those folks who bought Quicken Mac 2007 and went through the efforts to write a review and the grief of installing it. I shouldn't call you names, since you saved me the $60 and the pain of figuring out how to uninstall Q2007 and get my data back into Quicken 2006. I'll just skip all of that now.There was one favorable review, but that didn't strike me as being a real review. Think about it - why would someone go through the effort of listing all of the features of Quicken (we can get that from Quicken), even mentioning ones that he doesn't use, without commenting on most of the features mentioned?"
1,Misleading ad information.,"Even though the ad did say ""Old version"" it did not say that it was INCOMPATIBLE WITH IOS LION. I was looking for a Quicken that I was able to use with my MacBook Pro that would let me write checks and had better features than ""Essentials"". I feel I was cheated out of my $100."
3,I liked the PC version better,"I bought this product because I've switched from PC to MAC and have been using the PC product for many years.Migrating from PC to MAC was not a smooth process. Rather than use the same QDATA file format, it was necessary to export the transactions in QIF form. During the export process, Quicken for the PC warned that some account names would be truncated. During the import process Quicken for Mac refused to import those accounts.The user interface is quite a bit different than the PC version, so that's taking some getting used to. Some operations are just more awkward than what I'm used to."
4,Quicjeb 2007 for Mac,I really do not use the added benefits of Quicken 2007 over the previous version. I have not had any problems with it and to date it has worked flawlessly. I have used Quicken since the late 1980s and use it with TurboTax. The reports that it generates are well done.
1,Intuit really short-changed us.,"I have used the Windows version of Quicken for years but when I switched to a Mac I thought I would give Quicken Mac 07 a try. Big mistake. There seemed to be a lot of necessary steps that were just missing in the Mac version, because the program just did not perform as expected from my experience with the Windows version. A lot of helpful explanations and steps to complete the basic tasks, even of set-up were not there. The Mac version could not differentiate between multiple accounts at the same bank, even when they had different account numbers. Transactions kept getting mixed up, and I would then have to back and sort things out manually. After a couple of months I went back to my Windows laptop, because I had been keeping a shadow set-up there rather than trust something this important to the Mac version. I still like the Mac and don't miss Windows that much, but I sure thing Intuit just kind of waved a white flag when they formulated Quicken for Mac 07."
4,The Software is Really OK,"I really didn't want to purchase Quicken for Mac because of all of the bad press it has. I have been using Quicken since 1997 and we just purchased our first Mac so I was hoping to move everything over. I downloaded Quicken today and also printed out the instructions from Intuit's website about converting Quicken for Windows files to Quicken for Mac. You do have to follow their directions and change some things before uploading your data into Mac, but I have 2 small children around me at all times and I was able to do it with little frustration. The only thing that I did have to go back and ammend was the opening balances since I didn't want to import everything, only the last year's worth. Other than that, we are all good. Hopefully this review will help. I did go and look at MoneyDance software and even downloaded the free trial. I wasn't impressed. I like the Quicken format and am also looking forward to the update this summer!"
1,Martin,Quicken is a disaster. This does not work on new MACs only ancient ones.Who has an ancient mac now.Quicken essentials looks like it was made by a child.
5,Quicken 2007 Mac,"Fantastic product, it is a pity it isn't available in Australia, the freight hurt. Trying to register the product wasn't possible as in typical US style if you don't live in America the registration system can't cope, such is.The product has simplified my home accounting and we now have a great view on our expenses."
2,Not really written for Mac,"I have the 2006 version of this, so my comments refer to that. But I know Quicken and I'd surprised if they've changed it much for 07. I've used Quicken for decades and find it fairly straightforward, unlike the previous reviewer. There are things you have to get used to, but let's face it, that's always true. The problem with this particular version is that it's not actually written for Mac. It runs under Rosetta, which more or less translates it from Windows, and it doesn't translate it very well. This shows up in various annoying ways. For instance it often refuses to back up data. With any application this is irritating, but with a financial record it could be catastrophic. And occasionally the application will quit unexpectedly. So far I haven't lost any data, but it's probably only a matter of time. If you must have Quicken, get a PC. If you have a Mac, get something else. Sorry, but I can't recommend anything."
2,Not User Friendly,This product seems to be great until you try to convert your PC saved data to MAC. Very confusing and not user friendly.
1,A BAD PROGRAM - At least they have a 60-day money back guarantee,"I used to have a PC and used MS Money. It was a very good program. Now I have a Mac and I switched to Quicken. This is a VERY BAD PROGRAM. As an example, in 30 minutes this morning, it shut down on me 6 times! One of those times it even corrupted the file so I had to go to a back-up copy. I NEVER had any problems like this with MS Money. Makes me actually wish I hadn't switched to Mac! The only good thing I see is that Quicken's website says they have a 60-day money back guarantee. I haven't tried it yet, so I hope I don't get problems returning it like I have using it!!!!"
1,Attention Mac Users,"For the love all that is good in this world...run, do not walk, RUN away from this software. Where should you run too? A copy of parallels, VM ware, or bootcamp and get the windows version of this program. Since switching to the mac I have been frustrated with this ""software"". It had been sometime since I had used personal financial software and the first time on a mac. I thought man....this program seems worst than my 2002 version on windows. After trying the usual suspects, liquid ledger, ibank, icash etc. I went to the windows 2008 version of quicken via parallels. Oh my god! the feature set is night and day. The windows version has about 15 essential features that the mac shows no signs of ever attempting.Until intuit gets serious about the mac version stay away from this nonsense."
1,Horrible! Crashes every time you open it.,"This program crashes way too often, sometimes so much so that I can't use it at all. Would not recommend this for anybody."
1,Avoid using Quicken if at all possible!!!,"It is astounding at how Quicken seems dedicated to making Quicken for Mac the worse possible product on the market. In the latest version, they removed the 'Recent Files' menu item, which I use several times in a single session. Why? The only answer I've gotten is ""The development team decided it was not necessary.""Avoid this product. Once they get you into their tentacles, it's hard to escape."
1,no go from 2002 to 2007,"I bought a new iMac and decided to upgrade my Quicken to 2007. I can't open my old 2002 Quicken files. After one week of working with Quicken's tech support, it's still not working."
1,PowerPC Binary!,"First impression: Holy cow! this looks just like Quicken 2006...Second Impression: Performance S_U_C_K_S on an Intel-based iMac. Sure enough, a quick check reveals that it is still a PowerPC binary. C'mon guys, can't you get with the picture? The product still lags WAY behind the Windows version, but you could at least make one that doesn't have to run in emulation. I could buy VMware Fusion, a copy of Windows XP, and Quicken for Windows if I wanted that -- I'd end up with more functionality and probably better speed as well.If this thing dies when I run budgeting tasks like every release of the 2006 version, I'm going through the roof!"
1,"If I wanted to run software like this, I wouldn't have a Mac","I'm sure this product is fine for someone who wishes they'd have gone to school to be an accountant. But if you just want to keep track of where your money is, Quicken just isn't worth the effort. The minimal documentation sure doesn't help."
3,As Usual Few Changes Made,Bought Quicken 2007 and with the exception of a new widget I don't see any improvements made in this version. When I compare the Quicken 2007 PC version with this I am shocked at just how bad Mac users have been treated. The PC version of 2007 has MANY more features and is far more powerful for the same amount of money.
2,Just buy Parallels,"This is nowhere near as useful as Quicken for Windows, so if you are switching from a PC, just save what you would have spent on Quicken Mac and spend your money on Parallels or Fusion so you can keep running Quicken Win. Quicken Mac has lost transactions, is impossible to keep reconciled and is just poorly designed. It is the only Mac program I have that has not been updated to run natively on Intel processors, a change Apple made about three years ago."
3,Quicken 2007 for Mac,"A lot has been said about this program. Most negative, but I purchased it anyways. I gave it a 3 star because it doesn't perform well in the automated modes such as download statements accurately, reconcile, etc, but I'm going to use it anyways. I mainly use it in manual entry mode to track my finances and reconcile them manually when I get my statements. It does work accurately when I download my statements from some financial institutions to desktop and import them into Quicken. Even though lousy, it is more professional than the other Mac programs I have tried. I have no idea as to what it will do with stocks or other financial tracking."
2,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING,"I have used Quiken for Windows in the past and have always been very impressed with the way the product worked and how easy it was to use, but I have to say I was extremely disappointed in the Mac version of Quiken because it was much less sophisticated than the Windows version and the majority of my Banks and investment accounts did not allow for downloading or internet access with the Mac product."
1,"Woefully incomplete, incompatible","If you're considering switching from Windows to Mac, you need to either cross Quicken off your list or forget about your old data. I have years of financial data that simply disappears or becomes corrupt when attempting to convert it from Windows to Mac Quicken. The best Intuit will do for you is charge you to reset your balances (seriously!). We decided we'd just start with new books, but then found the Mac version so be so short of features compared to the Windows that we simply abandoned it and now run Windows Quicken on XP under Parallels. When we can find a Mac product by *anybody* that can import the Quicken data, we're kicking Intuit to the curb without regret."
2,Quicken 07 for Macs,this is a watered down version of quicken for pc's -- instead consider ibank for mac.
2,Bad Photo,"OK, so I'm stupid!These spatulas are for batter and not for a frying pan. What a disappointment.But they are good quality so I kept them anyway. Don't let the picture fool you."
1,not a good shape,"I love the trudeau spatulas, but not this one, I don't like the angle of the tip and the spatula is flat so you can't use it to scoop even a tiny bit of sauce."
3,Not quite what I hoped for,"This seems to be a very good quality spatula, but I wanted one that was a bit flexible on the end, and this isn't. I've used it for stirring things like I would use a wooden spoon, and it is just fine. I'm sure I'll use it a lot that way, but continue to hunt for the perfect spatula."
3,Cliched look at football,"I picked up this novel based on the recent Sports Illustrated ranking of top 100 sports books, but it wouldn't make any list of mine. Good but not great, Delillo juxtaposes college football with nuclear warfare in what was meant as a satirical look at American life in the 1950s. It came off as a confusing, contrived mesh between the two.Where Delillo does score well is on the dialogue. The comical conversations by teammates on the bench during pivitol action seem so real. And Delillo's terminology and feel for the game is stunningly accurate.I found book too heady to comprehend. But in layman's terms I believe Delillo was simply trying to say that war is too grave to be compared to a game taken vastly too serious by a gladiator culture.However, I felt Delillo was also trying to make the point that war and football are practiced by at times neurotic and destructive individuals."
2,Very weak and I'm a DeLillo fan,"The book had some moments, but they were few and far between. I get the metaphor, but then what? Football as a metaphor for life and war isn't exactly new, and while DeLillo has a nice style I just felt let down. The only thing I could say about DeLillo's End Zone is at least it wasn't as bad as the Body Artist."
3,Football Zen or Bad Acid Trip,"I like the writing, but the story ..... is this suppose to a be a zen thing, or the result of a bad acid trip? Starts out okay, and then goes helter skelter. I didn't find it humorous. I didn't find it sad. I didn't find it. The characters just didn't come to life for me. It was all shallow and fragmented as a story.I've read Cosmopolis, Body Artist, and Names. Don;t know if I will read any others. And, again, there is something I like about DeLillo's writing."
4,Funny Book,"OK, it may lag in places, it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but parts of this novel are so brilliant and laugh-out-loud funny that it hardly matters whether the final result is a masterpiece or simply a series of set-pieces. Made me ashamed of every ""clever"" thought I've ever had about football. His are a lot cleverer. Now I'm going to shut up and watch them Ravens."
2,The Firebrand,"I have been ill, I haven't finished the book yet, only up to where Lucy is going to see Randolph about Maggie being his daughter, so I really can't give a true rating of this book yet. Sorry."
2,Where was the romance?,"The characters were very much different. Rand clearly didn't like Lucy. Lucy was too hung up on feminist issues. When they did get married (for convience of course)she seemed more concerned with being a feminist than a wife. She was bossy. Oh and then they had sex. The ending tied up nicely, but there was cleary something missing along the way-the romance and the love between the two characters. In fact the last chapter was the only romantic part of the book."
5,Loved this book.,"I love Susan Wiggs. I started with the last one in this series, but I could not put it down. It was very interesting. Lucy the heroine is very unusual in her suffregette views. She is not the best looking character, but she is very sassy. Very interesting, well put together book."
3,"Good, but not great","While I enjoyed this book, it seemed to be lacking something. Maybe it was the lack of development of the relationship between Lucy and Rand. I just don't see how they fell in love with each other. I did find Lucy a little annoying."
5,A fine anthology.,"I still make cassette compilations (out of habit and ease of editing/fading), and this CD set is better than the Pharoah tape I made for myself. A must have, especially if you don't have many of his records (buy them too!). I go back to ""Tauhid"" (which you should have), and consider it one of my top-30 all-time records."
4,Decent book.,"I thought this was a decent book with some good anecdotes and stories. One thing to consider--even though it may not be a literary masterpiece, it IS a book about Sly, and it does cover a lot of his activities, both as a DJ and then as the perenially F*d up bandleader for probably the funkiest band in history. That fact, in and of itself, makes it worth reading. To me, an average book about Sly is always better than a great book on lesser topics.By the way, isn't Sly still alive? Doesn't that exempt him from technically being a ""drug casualty?"""
3,Frustrating,"I was very much attracted to the subject matter and I thought interviewing those involved was an excellent approach to it. I was frustrated by the lack of dates and context to the words of those interviewed. Without constantly flipping to the back to check on the dates in the discography, I had no idea whether I was in 1968 or 1972. I was hoping for a more definitive text."
1,"Looks okay at first glance, but does not work","I was weary of buying the non-Garmin-branded version of this accesory, and rightly so. While everything appears to be of decent quality upon inspection, the cable just does not work. The vehicle power side works, but the interface side does not. I cannot upload data or interface with mapping programs and I cannot send updates to my unit. Additionally, the plug fit is not as good as the original Garmin unit. The plug fits tight, but it's about twice as big and pushes up on the rubber surround of my eTrex. The return policy leaves my with about a $5 refund and out $15 and my time. Go OEM."
5,great piece of cabling,"Bought this to interface my Garmin Ledgend to my laptop software and it works great. I used it with Google Earth and Earthbridge software and had no issues. I later bought a GPS receiver unit that plugged into the USB port so now I don't need it. Wish I had bought the receiver before I got this cable but oh well, I now have a reliable backup."
3,Pretty Good,"When I first heard about this movie, I was definitely skeptical. I had seen my fair share of singers trying to be actresses, so I wanted to see for myself if Monica could pull off a starring role.For the most part, I thought the story was very nice. Monica did a pretty good job with her acting. However, there were moments where her emotions seemed forced - almost as if she was trying too hard. Christian Kane did an excellent job as her love interest even though I wish his character would have been developed a little more.Overall, this is a pretty good movie. It was nice to see a movie about an interracial couple where things turned out for the good and the characters didn't let society and their families determine their happiness."
3,Love Song,"I enjoyed the movie ""Love Song"" very much. It was warm, funny, and thought provoking. I enjoyed not only the relationship that Monica built with Christian Kane, but also her relationship with her mother and her girlfriends/roommates.It was refreshing to see a good, complicated love story without the unnecessary, steamy love scenes. Love is complicated and the movie did a good job of portraying how complicated love can be particularly if you are crossing cultures.Lastly, I played the movie over and over again just to hear Christian Kane sing (no disrespect to Monica)but I loved his voice. I searched frantically for a Soundtrack for this movie but couldn't find out if there actually was one. If anyone knows if there was a soundtrack and how I could get a copy, I would be grateful to hear from you."
1,Best romantic film in a long time,"I'm not usually a fan or romantic films, but this was great, especially since it wasn't filled with unecessary sex scenes that most romantic films have nowadays.First saw christian kane in angel and thought he was so cute, which is the main reason why i first watched this film. Even if you're not a fan of him at the moment you will have fallen in love with him by the end of the movie. Monica has one of the greates voices i have heard.The only problem is that its not available in the UK which means i will have to get it imported and the price is already a lot more than i would normally spend on any film."
3,it was so sweet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"great movie. realistic characters. monica was a little too forced during emotional scenes but it was awsome. i am not sure of the name of the ""Angel"" star who plays her love interest but he is great and sexy. the only thing lacking was an amazing love scene."
1,Do these people use Miss Cleo to get their values,These people must use Miss Cleo's tarrot cards to get their prices.
3,what the dealers use.,I like this book because it is more accurate than the cheap price guides that can be purchased at convenience stores. I believe all dealers have heard of this book and KBB has a great web site also.
5,superior product,"My paint was in excellent condition as I like to wash and wax my car. I was always looking for the next best product and used Klasse All-in-One followed by the high gloss sealant. Following the application of Klasse products, my wife set a soda can on the car and it slide right off onto the ground. The finish was never this slick. I have 1 product that I use now, and that is Klasse. Initial purchase is expensive, but a little goes a long way."
3,klasse sealant - good but needs a lot of buffing,Klasse sealant will definitely make your vehicle shine but requires alot of buffing. I had to buff my truck three different times to get it all off. It goes on thin and almost transparent but it leaves residue that continues to dry and show up all day. My vehicle is very dark so it probably shows more than light colors.
5,Wolfgang Auto Bath,"Wolfgang Auto Bath is to the car as Dove is to the skin. It actually feels smooth and silky being applied. It creates lasting suds that lubricate the surface of the car, helping to prevent any dirt from scratching the car's surface. It leaves little to no spotting when rinsed off. The product has a pleasant aroma (not at all overpowering.) I use Wolfgang Auto Bath about twice a month and don't feel I need to rewax the car more frequently than every 6 months."
4,Witty techno fun...,"This is the only blog that I actually have chosen to continue past the 14 day trial. The writing is witty and each review is short. Quick entertainment on an almost daily basis for any gadgeteer.Of course, the pictures are lacking given the Kindle's capabilities with graphics, but that's not the blog's fault. Just a little frustrating when you're trying to get a feel for the look of some crazy device that the blog is talking about. That being said, the pics are a somewhat necessity you're describing strange gizmos which makes this blog not entirely kindle-izable.Overall, an entertaining blog with some actual good ideas for unique presents. A gadgeteer's dream."
3,Audience would determin best fit,"My son asked for this book after seeing it at school. I think it must have been more entertaining in the hands of the librarian than in mine. He seemed to really really want it and because he was an advanced reader we try to follow-up with anything he deems challenging. But, the larger text meant to be very creative and artistic can be hard to read and the smaller text is just too small. Switching between text makes it difficult for young readers and perhaps ""older"" readings who are trying to read and ""show the pictures"".BUT, the audience of this book may NEVER have been a young 5 1/2 year old reader (reading 1st grade level books) - and for that you can't fault a very unique, educational even for adults, and humorously illustrated book.I think if I were a pre-school or Elem. teacher, it'd be an awesome book to have around - especially for the kids who are getting board with A,B,Cs and want to look at cool illustrations."
4,Very Experimental. Not their best.,"Mr. Children is one of the most popular rock groups in Japan. The peak of their popularity was around 1994-1997, when they became something of a social phenomenon. Discovery is their latest album including single tracks ""Hikari no sasu ho e"", ""owari naki tabi"" and ""I'll be (album version)"". Although the music on this CD is impressive, I think the album fails to live up to ""Atomic Heart"" and ""Bolero""."
3,Opiate is pretty chill,"""Objects for an Ideal Home"", is a decent bit of electronica. I had read a review in ""Tokion"" magazine that led me to believe this was a must have CD and that it was full of new sound explorations etc. In reality it is a good back ground music CD with some excellent rhythm programming. There is some experimental sound usage as in ""ToothPaste"", but not anything compared to what goes on in say, ""UFOrb"" by The Orb. All n all, a good CD, but if your after something with real edge and sonic innovation you might want to give it a pass."
3,Not What I expected,"Although I received this DVD prior to the estimated delivery date, I was expecting the ""Up Pompeii"" TV series and not the movie version. This was a randy romp though a semi-Roman extravaganza. I'll be crunching this DVD for sure!!!"
2,Oxford per Morse,"Morse fans will rejoice in his Oxford, but its long on talk, and less on tour of England's greatest.university city."
4,Inside Oxford,This DVD is excellent if you are a fan of Inspector Morse or Inspector Lewis and like Oxford as a background. Found it very enjoyable and informative
4,this one's for philologists,"This is a facsimile reprint of a book originally published early in the 20th century, before the spelling and pronunciation reforms of Common Cornish, so it will look strange to anyone familiar with the modern language. It was a historically important work, citing every Cornish word known from the texts in every variant form and neologisms derived from Welsh and Breton (these are marked with an asterisk). Consequently, this dictionary is not recommended for those who only wish to be part of the modern Cornish language community, but it is a treasure-house of information for those interested in earlier phases of the language."
5,Wonderful contribution to the revival of Cornish,"In recent years, many languages thought dying or dead have been revived and the number of native-speakers of these languages has greatly increased, particularly among the Celtic languages of the British Isles. One of these has been the ancient and extinct language of Cornwall, thrilling for me as I may have a West Countryman or two in my family tree.I should say at the outset that I am not a trained linguist, so I do not know if the principles undergirding this book are sound or not. But they seem to be. This dictionary will go far toward keeping Cornish alive, perhaps even extending its influence to Cornishmen on this side of the Atlantic. Highly recommended."
5,Dayco Fan Belt,"The belt has to drive am 88 amp alternator and while at start up a little slippage occurs, it performs perfectly the rest of the day. I wish the belt would have been made 1/32"" wider in the furture"
4,review,"Case is great. I do not care for the clip however, which is basically upside down. Used properly, the clip shows about 1 1/2 inches before the cell phone case---does not look good. The only way to get it to look normal is to wear the phone upside down."
2,"Technically good , but lacks content","Good cd , in a matter of technical interest about how a SACD would sound like, but i think it lacks quality in the music collection itself (artists,songs)."
4,Solid horror,"This movie wasn't the greatest horror movie, but given the budget, I enjoyed it. The story is pretty cool, gets quite cheesy at times, but what horror movie doesn't. The voodoo idea was done in a way that was creepy and believable, but not overly Hollywood glamorized idea of Voodoo. I'd recommend this movie to someone who wants a good way to spend a Friday night."
4,Voodoo Meets Jason,"First of all I watch all sorts of slasher flicks, I've watched hundreds of horror movies so I think I know what I'm talking about. Now, this movie is basically a voodoo fed Friday the 13th I cant get enough of Jason and voodoo is cool so I give this movie a thumbs up, I liked it from the crazy ass voodoo snakes to the kick ass tow truck. The body count was pretty good and the blood flow and guts shown was respectful Fangora style. I bought this movie on Amazon with out watching it first taking a gamble and I was not disappointed I will definitely recommend Venom for any horror movie collector."
3,Venom Review,"Venom was a unique blend between The Skeleton Key, Halloween, and Jeepers Creepers. I thought it was an okay movie, but would recommend this movie for people who love the typical, teenage slasher type of movies. But for people who can't stand the sight of blood and gore, this movie is not for you."
3,Thank good for the swamp,Thank good for the swamp and the back ground because it helped alot to make this movie scarey...but other than that on my review meter the arrow is between fair/ok can't complain just watch wolf creek then you'll see venom isn't really bad...
4,Good film for horror buffs !,"Went to see Venom while on holiday, not really heard much about it, so didn't expect much, was kinda worried as used to buy cheap low budget crap off the internet and girlfriend said she would strangle me if it was bad. Well she really enjoyed it and so did I, had good effects and a good few scares, also saw Cry Wolf while we were there and although good, not a patch on venom, obviously Cry Wolf starring Bon Jovi has had more advertising hence the reason it has taken 5 time more in box office since it opened, if I had to choose I would definately recommend Venom"
1,CRAPOLA TO THE FIRST DEGREE,EVERYONE IS LEAVING POSITIVE REVIEW FOR MOVIE MUST HAVE SEEN A DIFFERENT MOVIES.JUST ANOTHER EMPTY TEEN HORROR MOVIES. THE BLOOD IN THIS FILM LOOK RED PAINT.SO IF U HAVE SEEN ANY TEEN HORROR FILM IN THE LAST 40 YEARS THEN U DON'T NEED TO BUY THIS VENOM. BUNCH OF VOODOO BULLSH*T.ONLY THING THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THIS FILM WATCHABLE IF NICK CANNON HAD BEEN IN THE SWALLOWED BY A PYTHON SO HE COULDN'T MAKE IT TO SET TO MAKE UNDERCLASSMAN
3,i didnt see this movie,i didnt see this movie because it looks like poop. But i would buy it for a best friend though.
4,Ready For The Sequel,"Venom is absolutely worthy of being a franchise. I love the movie and the death scenes are excellent! Its not your usual slit the throat and blood trickles out of the wound, but instead slash the throat with a crowbar and chunks of flesh and muscle and blood splatter. The horror movies now a days are kind of pathetic with their PG-13 ratings, most of the time I would not even consider them horror movies but action thrillers. Venom is sure to have a sequel and I can't wait for it! Watch out, Ray is coming back!"
3,"""Venom"" (2005)","This is your basic horror film. Thats all... nothing special. If your a horror fan, check it out, you'll like it."
2,Practical Guide but NOT for Java Programmers,"I have to disagree with the title. As an experienced programmer I found the book to be nearly useless. It's well written and gives a quick overview of JDBC, but if you plan to actually develop using JDBC, you're going to need much more. I might recommend this for students or managers needing to know what JDBC is or when to use it, but not for learning how to use it."
3,Good intro to Java API with examples,"This is a good intro to selecting one or several records or updating one or several records using the JDBC api, with examples in Java. He also provides actual java classes based on the java api, but I didn't find his classes very reusable - I don't think it was very good OO design, just good JDBC examples. I bought the book to get some source code that I could re-use, but it was just too terse. Now that I am learning Design Patterns, I might look at his code again, with the idea of rewriting it. Most people are better of learning Hibernate."
3,Probably try a different flavor,"I LOOOOVE most furikake, especially on rice and for spam musubis. Unfortunately this flavor just does not taste that good / flavorful to me. I'd try a different type"
3,"People, this book is SATIRE.","To people trying to critique this book on technical merits: The book is 100% satire!The author is poking fun at both the whole script-kiddie culture and at YOU, the reader who actually thought the book was serious.So take the book for what it's worth - a silly bit of technical satire that is about getting a chuckle more than actually imparting any real wisdom."
2,What a dissappointment,"Obviously, I wasn't expecting the book to tell me all about security and the hacker subculture. Although it is rather funny at times, it seems to me as a very basic Windows XP manual, just explaining how to customize the desktop and making other people believe you are überskilled while playing pranks on th3m.I didn't expect it to be a Linux manual, either, but I don't buy the idea of using Windows (or any other propietary OS) as a hacking platform. Maybe it will be useful for you if you've just bought your first computer and are interested in being more than a simple user, but for the experienced guy, think it twice before buying.Check the author's website before making any decision: www.icodeviruses.com"
2,Not worth reading if you are over the age of 14.,"I read over this book in a Barnes and Noble, and I was disappointed. This is another cheap attempt to cash in on ""hacker"" culture. With it's gratuitous use of ""l33t sp34k"" and lack of real information, the only people this book is going to reach are 14 year old script kiddies, who more than likely already possess skills beyond this book. Especially comical are the ""hacker laws"" and the use of Windows XP as a hacking platform. I'd also like to point out that a lack of punctuation does not make the book cool.If you want to learn about security, try reading Hacking Exposed, and if you want to learn about the culture, try reading something by Kevin Mitnick. This book fails in both respects."
2,Not meant for anyone over the age of 13,If the author is only 12-15 years old then this is an admirable 1st attempt at writing & I hope he/she will begin computer science studies immediately after graduation from High School. If the author is over the age of 18 & god forbid over the age of 30 then this is a miserable & disjointed attempt to educate anyone on the subject of hacking. I would recommend searching the internet to learn about hacking methodology instead...
3,Mediocre,"Not for a computer security expert. More for someone who wants to fit in for gamers, would not reccomend if you want to learn about actual hacking. They barely scrape the surface of computers."
3,French chanson with a light opera feel,"One of the more operatic and songbirdish of the early French chanson starlets, Yvonne Printemps may hold limited appeal to a modern audience, even to those who like the antiquity and old-fashioned feel of other singers from the 1920s and '30s. This collection spans a wide swath of her career, from 1929-1943, but even on the later material there is a lot of prissy, aria-like trilling, and very little indication that Printemps was aware of, or interested in any stylistic changes that had entered the popular culture in the intervening decades. This also includes several scenes of dialogue excepted from films such as ""Mariette"" (1929) and ""Veronique"" (1941), which add some context to her career, but also stand out next to the musical numbers. I found this disc kind of borderline: if I concentrated on her voice, I found it irritating, but if I just let the album play in the background, beyond my conscious attention, it was okay."
1,"Disappointing, and certainly not complete","I was really disappointed with this book. I think that the words 'complete' and 'encyclopedia' are both misleading. I gave my copy away. If you really want a complete encyclopedia then get the AHS (American version) or RHS (English version) Encyclopedia of Garden Plants, edited by Christopher Brickell."
4,I am hungry for more....,"It was amazing! It showed and didn't tell. It did wonderful world building without using half a chapter to develop some sense of the worlds involved. It developed very naturally. It was also one of the more intriguing books I have read. I love the way this book was written. Although I must warn readers without a deep interest in the philosophical or underlying psychology behind art and music to think twice before reading this book. It doesn't condescend but I suspect it might be a bit beyond the tastes of readers who enjoy the simpler science fiction. This man, obviously, as an historian, has a deep reverence in art and the development of period trends.Also, the art style he introduces, it sounds so compelling that I would love to see it implemented on a piece of canvas or in architecture. I have left this author wanting more..."
5,A book that is both fun and funny,"I bought a couple copies of this to give as gifts and ended up reading it, and kept one for myself. A lot of funny stories and useful information told with humor and personality. Also a great bargain at the price offered here."
5,5 Fabulous Stars!!!!!,"I'm not going to waste time mentioning all the ways this book is awesome. The things you need know about this book are that Nelson's writing style is engaging; it draws the reader in from page 1. The book flows from the 'Whys' to the 'Hows' of dinner parties effortlessly and entertainingly. And finally, Nelson's recipes and party ideas are simple, elegant, and easy-to-do.This book is entertaining and a great way to demystify the dinner party."
5,"Well, OF COURSE I have to give it 5 stars! I WROTE IT!","How could I resist the opportunity to tell my fellow Amazon-ians how flattered and pleased I would be for you to check out my book? Researching and writing ""Let's Dish Up A Dinner Party!"" was a labor of love and I couldn't be more delighted with the wonderful feedback I've been receiving since it's release (October, 2004).I hope you will find it as helpful and amusing as I do... and I invite you to pop me an email to let me know if that is the case!Best wishes & dishes to you... May all your dinner parties be fun and festive!Nelson AspenAuthorwww.nelsonaspen.com"
5,Great rice seasoning,"I bought this because I'm slowly getting into doing bentos, and rice onigris seemed like something cute to try to do, but I feared they would be too bland. I heard about furikake and it seemed like a good idea in order to give rice some taste; then the problem was: which furikake variety to choose?I like nori (the seaweed used to wrap sushi, and the one most furikakes contain if it just says ""seaweed""), but I know I would be wrapping my onigris in it to avoid them falling apart. I was reticent to try one of the more ""fishy"" ones, as I'd heard that the fish taste could be overwhelming. So this one -- mixture of bonito and nori -- seemed like a good choice.Just tried it for the first time last night, and it's great!I just wish that either my Asian grocery or Amazon also stocked egg furikake, since I've heard that that one's pretty good too."
5,Wonderful rice flavoring!,"We have tried all the Furikake flavors, and we love them all. We add it to all our rice dinners - especially when serve rice with sliced cucumbers and salmon. Even my mother, who detests sushi, loves this flavoring. She even requested her own bottle! A little goes a long way, and we just sprinkle it over the serving bowl. People who can't get enough, usually sprinkle a little extra on their own portions. (Like myself!)"
1,nasty yuck i did not like it at all. taste like dirt,this is the most nasty stuff i ever tasted it is yuck not worth buying taste like dirt.
3,"Not easy to program, although it's the original!","I bought this original keyless entry remote for my 2006 Sebring convertible as a second and it looks exactly like my original, along with the company stamp on the back. But when I tried to program it,it works, but then my original doesn't work anymore. It just goes from one to the other. In other words, when I program the one I purchased, the original gets de-programmed and visa versa. I can't get them both to work at the same time. I googled 4 different methods of programming and it's the same with all methods. I had a few people try it with the same results. This keyless entry is supposed to be for a few different years, not just 2006."
5,Excellent Book!,I bought this book for my mother because she had checked it out of the library and liked it so much she wanted one of her own. She hasn't played Bridge in years but used to play a lot and found it to be very helpful for refreshing her memory and practicing games.
5,love this book,"I love the series, the story of her experiences are wonderfully graphic told with passion and clear understanding. I believe her experience. I am buy her complete series."
4,"Informative, but not real deep","For the most part I did not view this book as a 'manual for Spiritual Warfare"", but more of a personal testimony and reiteration of John's Book of Revelation...nothing new, but a 'retelling' of what it was that John himself saw in his vision. Baxter's rendition is easier to read, however, than the original, Biblical text, especially for new Christians.I could have easily not finished the book and not felt I would be missing out on some new understanding. However, it does have value for the new believer and for open-minded 'older' believers just learning about the spiritual realm, as it most certainly describes this realm which so few are even aware of existing."
1,She Puts God Down Herself.,"Mary Baxter wrote a very goof fictional book. I do not believe she has seen any of these realms. She talks about how god and jesus are so great, and then tells you how they won't forgive you because judgment has already been set. God is much more understanding in my book and forgives anyway. She makes him seem cruel just like satan in this book! Her views are Bull!"
5,A book that should be read,This is one book that should be read. Mary has been given the most awesome gift of seeing things that we can only begin to imagine or things that we will only see when we are gone from this world. I have also read the heaven and hell books and they are amazing also. I have always wondered what is beyond this world and Mary's accounts of the spirit realm through Jesus is wonderful. I hope that she will write more books. I love to read anything about Jesus and what is beyond this world.
4,EARLY TITLE NOW ON DVD.,"I HAD A COPY OF THIS 1983 CONTEST ON VHS IN THE EARLY 90'S. I HAVE 6 OF THE LATER CONTESTS ON DVD AND WELCOME THIS AS COLLECTABLE. THERE IS A 20 YR DIFFERENCE, AND NOW THEY ARE ARE NOT BEING PRODUCED AS STANDARD ON DVD.THE PICTURE QUALITY ISNT BAD, GOOD VHS STANDARD.SLIGHT HUE ADJUSTMENT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR BEST PICTURE.WITH A RUN TIME OF 86 MINUTES,IN MY OPINION THIS WAS IF ANYTHING ON THE SHORT SIDE.THE LATTER BUTTMAN DVDS ARE TWO OR THREE HOURS.THERE ARE SEVERAL EROTIC AND DANCE SCEENS.THE CONTESTANTS HAVE A MORE NATURAL LOOK THAN IN THE LATER CONTESTS.UNFORTUNATLY BECAUSE OF THERE NEW ARRIVAL AT THE SUN CLUB MANY OF THEM HAD BIKINI LINE SUN TAN PROBLEMS."
2,"Look good, not too durable","I had these a while ago. They lasted approximately two weeks before splitting wide open on the side. However, I used them heavily (lacrosse about 10-12 hours of practice a week), and I have wide feet, so my cleats never last long. Typically I wear normal width cleats because it's hard to find wide ones, and I hate how wide shoes look. So I have to deal with cleats splitting on the sides, like these ones did. However, usually they last longer than two weeks.Not highly recommended. I'd take a look at some Nike Speed TDs, Hurache TDs, or Vapors. I've worn them all and like them all. I purchase cleats based on three factors: weight (low as possible), appearance (got to look good to play good), and price (low as possible).I attempt to get molded cleats if possible because they have more studs. Two studs in the back on screw-in cleats is not enough for good grip if you're changing directions. Just avoid running on concrete with them and they'll last long enough."
5,how did I miss this,don't cha love it when something comes along completely out of the blue and you wonder how you got along without it? A sound that is well worn and still distinct. This outfit picks up where Velvet Underground left off leading into the freak folk movement. This is an instant classic which may well slip into obscurity which somehow makes it all the more precious.
5,The BEST book of the summer 2004!,My aunt gave me The Key To The Goldenfire Bird for my birthday. That was two days ago and I couldn't put it down. This is a great book! I don't want to give anything BUT let me tell you I laughed so hard at the beginning of the book that my mom asked if I'd hurt myself. I also cried and laughed some more.The sisters are so different from each other. I think I'm more like Brooks. Pete is the most awesome character ever.I give this book a 5 out of 5 and will definitely read it again before the summer is done.(...)
2,.....,"Am I the only one who couldn't stand this book? It was so dull! It took me about two months to read it because I was constantly putting it down to read other, more interesting books. I didn't like one of the characters-- not one. It finally picked up near the end, but I disliked this story. Very Much."
4,Milla at her sweetest,This was a good movie and there was some real chemisty between Milla and her awkward nerdy leading man who has a good heart but keeps putting his foot in his mouth. Baldwin and Denise Richards are an after thought and could have been played by anybody. Milla is the star and is perfect in this kind of role. This movie should have been released in the theaters in the states. She is a sweety.
5,B'z simply...is the best....,"B'z is Tak Matsumoto on Guitar and Kohshi Inaba on vocals, and a Japanese band of mythic proportions, selling out stadiums all over Japan for the past 11 years. This was the 2nd ""Best of"" CD that was released by B'z in 1998, to celebrate their 10th Anniversary. Mainly tracks selected by fans, this CD is great for anyone wanting to learn more about this amazing band. With songs like ""TIME"", ""Liar! Liar!"", ""Negai"", ""Mienai Chikara ~Invisible One~"", as well as remakes of two classic songs, ""Pleasure 98"" and ""RUN 98"", you will learn more about this outsatnding band..."
5,Garmin compatible PC Interface cable with 110V power adapter.,I found this item affordable and easy to use. Works great with my Etrex and plan on using it in the near future when I purchase another GPS unit.
1,Only 10 Days were worth the movie,"I returned this movie. Being a Christmas movie fan, I could see no need to retain this in my home. The main reason - the producers found it necessary to include in one of the Christmas Eve's a portion of the main character being extremely self-absorbed -- he buys everything he wants, treats people anyway he wants -- which OK is what self-absorbed people do, however, I didn't need the scene where he has self-fulfilling sex with his girlfriend. The whole bed scene could have been eliminated, even if the producers alluded to it.At best, the acting was B-rated."
2,a christmas repeat....,"Really, the main character has to repeat this day of dying many, many times before he gets it right! It is way too much like Ground Hog day but less funny. The crudeness and unbelievableness makes this a two star movie. I don't recommend it as a family movie."
5,Great DVD,My husband and I enjoy this with our annual Christmas DVD viewings. This is such an unusual and fun seasonal gift.
2,Don't expect too much from it,"I shall agree that the illustrations are great. However, the book contains very limited information about the wonders or their history. If you like to look at the pictures along this book is for you, but if you like to read about the Ancient wonders you need to look somewhere else. There are many books that cover this subject in a lot more details."
1,Kid's rap cd,I felt the words were still too adult for a child. I was looking for something more appropriate to a child under 5.
3,More on Steamboat Willie,"Steamboat Willie is also available on ""The Spirit of Mickey,"" which is a collection of classic Mickey Mouse cartoons including ""The Band Concert"" (first color cartoon) and ""Lend a Paw"" (Academy Award winner featuring Pluto's shoulder angel and devil)."
4,not that bad,come onjust cuz theres no extras doesn't mean its that badi mean aren't the episodes what you really want?i enjoyed this it's cool having ATHFon the goif you ask me its really great
2,Not one of his best books.,"I love Gene Hill and have read him for years but this is not one of his best books. There are however a couple of really good essays in this book, notably the one on Sandwiches and the one on Pocketknives written as only the great GH can do. Very little on fishing."
5,Ant Safari,"My daughter just loves this ant farm. She waters the ants every day and checks to see what progress and tunnels they have made overnight. She is really amazed at what the ants do and you can see them in action.Her dad,Bob"
4,The best!!!,"When I got my ant farm, I was eger to get my ants. But instead of paying $2 I had to pay $4 witch didn't matter much. Befor I got my ants, I studied the ant farm. These were the best that you can buy. The ants can roam in a larger space unlike thoughs 2D ones."
2,Cheap plastic torn on AntZone,"I've just set the AntZone up and am not optimistic. The plastic is flimsy and was a little cracked at the bottom edge, so a lot of sand leaked out. I taped it up before putting the ants in, but that probably wouldn't have been a problem. Most of the ants are dead or dying. It probably didn't help that they traveled via mail during a heat wave. We'll see what the others do, and hope they don't figure out a way out!"
4,Nuku Nuku becomes human,"This is volume 2/3.The husband-wife battle over the technology that is Nuku Nuku heats up, just as Nuku Nuku starts to learn what it means to be human. Ironic twist in this custody battle over ""property."" Instead of joining in the battle, Nuku Nuku tries to patch things up. Will this win her the respect of her ""Mother""?Adding to the mix is a new android for a rival, Eimi. Very cute android, but not nice like Nuku Nuku. The two have interesting ""competitions"" until a major threat to a family member becomes more of a challege in and of itself. This volume is a bit like Project A-ko, where A-ko and B-ko battle all of the time.Lots of fun in this volume. A true anime classic."
4,Cat owners will want custody of this one,"This is volume 1 of 3.In essence, this is a child custody battle story marketed as a cute cat girl story. The blending of the two make it quite exceptional:Papa-san and Mama-san split up. Papa-san runs away with his son taking with his android prototype project. In the resulting shoot-out, their recently adopted stray cat gets killed. Papa-san modifies the android, and the result is an older sister for his son; All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku.The rest of the story is how Nuku Nuku adapts to her new surroundings (pretending to be human) while deep down she is really a cat, at least at first... Providing situations is Mama-san, a powerful business exec scheming to steal back her son and the android unit.Lots of laughs, cat humor, destroyed buildings, but the under-lying relationships make this comedy anime plus. Most people should enjoy this one. Virtually all cat lovers will!"
4,"Very interesting album - must have for ""That Makes It""","Ok, I know everyone has heard the Big Bopper (J.P. Richardson) sing ""Chantilly Lace"", in which you hear one side of a telephone conversation with the Big Bopper and his rich, low voice talking to his girlfriend- ""Oh Baby, you knoooow what I like"".This album contains the rarely heard ""answer song"" where Jayne Mansfield sings the other side of that telephone call. Fascinating.Now, Jayne has a breathy sexy voice, nice to listen to, but isn't a great singer. However, the other songs on the album are not hard to listen to at all.So, if you have always wanted to hear the other side of that call, or just are a Jayne Mansfield fan, then buy this. Otherwise- not so much."
2,"It won't last, get someone else","I have had Klipsch speakers for years so when this came on the market 5 or 6 years ago, I rushed out and bought it. It sounded great but one day one of the speakers flopped over and would not stay upright, and then one day it just died. This model went out of production very quickly, newer iPods don't charge while they are playing, so I would say don't buy one of these, look for something newer in the market."
1,These units have terrible quality,"I bought my iFi unit about three years ago. I liked the sound so well I bought a second unit for anoher location. However, within two years the right channel in the amp has failed in both units. And, if you look on the internet you will find several for sale also with no working right channel. And, often now you see only the speakers for sale. I wonder why? These unit are expensive junk. This was my first experience spending a lot of money on Klipsch product and I assure you it will be the last. They generously offered to replace the failed component for $105 but I'm not willing to put any more money into these units since this is a cronic problem somewhere in the amp design.(had to buy a new remote sometime ago because it failed as well ... also a known problem) Stay way from Klipsch product. There are too many good alternatives out there to risk another Klipsch failure."
3,what?,i have to ask who has enough money to waste on a 200 dollar sound system for /mp3 format/ audio?
3,spatula,"These Trudeau silicone spatulas are very thick and bulky to hold. True, they hold up under heat, I just prefer a thinner spatula that is less weighty. It is difficult to maneuver with carpal tunnel syndrome."
3,small,"Even after reading other reviews, I still didn't grasp how small this spatula it. I like my other Trudeau Spatulas, and I am sure I will love this product just as much, I just don't know what I will use it for. It is too small (in my opinion) to use as a cooking spoonula, unless it is only used for gravies or sauces in a small .4 qt saucepan... we will see."
3,It's not a blue spatula - it's a teal SPOON.,"I completely agree with J. Koon ""grasshopper80""'s review. This is a spoon spatula, not a ""regular"" spatula, in that it's only 1.5 inches across. Not at all what I was expecting. In addition, the color is nothing like the bright cobalt blue in the picture. It is a definite teal color - a lot more green, and darker in hue.I am disappointed, not only in its size, but also in the color. I will keep it because I just store it in a drawer. But if you are ordering to store on a counter or wall, I would reconsider."
1,Tiny Spoonula,"This is a warning to everyone who wanted a regular heat-safe spatula, this ain't it! This is a very small-headed spoonula that has purposes I cannot think of. I thought I was getting a nice normal spatula, and I didn't read the reviews, but notice the picture. Notice how the head of the spatula is almost the same width as the handle? See how pointless? Don't buy.. and certainly, don't buy two like I did!"
3,"Good item, but not what I wanted","I didn't know that when I bought this ""spatula"" that it was a ""spoon spatula."" Nowhere in the description does it say that the head of this spatula is only 1.5 inches wide. It says ""spoon spatula"" on a sticker on the item when you take it out of the box, but nothing about it in the description.I blame myself for not researching its size, but that should have been listed. It is a great product though, nonstick and doesn't melt, but I was expecting something different. A better description and more research on my part would have circumvented this problem."
4,Practical introduction for the novice arborist,"This classic text gives a broad introduction to the field of tree management, including common health problems associated with trees and practical advice for solving them. It is an excellent primer for the novice arborist."
5,Simplified Windows XP,This book is excellent for people who have never used a computer before and wish to learn.
4,Not bad first season was better,It starts out in the middle of last season but still the same characters doing the same thing but in new adventers It is worth the buy and a good laugh. But make sure you do not have somone bugging you while watching
4,Great blade,"This knife is sleek, sharp and light. The belt clip is strong. Vary rugged knife. One tiny complant, it's a little stiff on the opening. Kinda hard to flick open, but over all a soild knife."
3,Eh,"Well, this knife was a bit of a letdown. Its sharp, it looks great, its useful, but the pocket clip has a design such that it is extremely difficult to get it clipped to your pocket. There are four points to the side of the clip that catch on your jeans and make getting it clipped in place both difficult and bad for the inside of your pocket. I have given up on carrying it in this way for fear of tearing the denim every time I use it and clip it back on. Don't get me wrong, I don't regret buying it, but I wish Buck had thought this through before putting it into production.So, if you would not be carrying this knife around with you often, buy it. Its a great knife. But, if you carry your knife clipped on your pocket, I would think twice about this one."
2,Poorly organized,"Having brought this along for not one but two Europe trips where it wasn't even worth the space it took up in my bag, it's time to retire it to a shelf permanently. Frommer's is trying to capitalize on the success of Fodor's GAY USA books which are pretty informative and well organized. Frommer's offering is too little, too late. Now-a-days there are gay mentions in lots of mainstream travel books. Virgin, the same people who bring you the record company, superstores, etc. also make travel books for major European cities which always include gay bars and gay hoods. Dorling Kindersley may not be gay, but they are hands down superior to any other guide out there and worth every cent. Just grab a Spartacus or look online to find out where the gay areas are, or pick up a gay mag or flyers once you get there. By all means, don't plan on this book giving you anything but a frustrating, jarbled mess of vague maps and bland information."
4,A very pleasant surprise,"As a diehard fan of the original, I was skeptical of the pared down orchestations and chorus. I was very pleasantly surprised to hear all the harmonies I thought I'd miss. The lack of ""clutter"" allows the brilliant lyrics to ring through with amazing crispness. The performances were brilliant as well. Having just seen the national touring production, it is truly amazing what these performers accomplish with their voices and incredible instrumental talent. My only criticsim of the recording is the ommission of a few songs. Highly reccommended to any Sondheim fan."
4,A Little Too Small but Ingenueously Done,"Though I like this recording, Patti Lupone is terrific as are most of the ensemble. It's nice to be able to hear and appreciatte every Sondheim lyric, but don't care for Michael Cerveris's over the top, mannered performance. And definitely miss the full grandness of the original, which I saw several times. No one can top Angela Lansbury, Lupone wisely doesn't attempt to emulate her, and the hugeness of it was part of what made it so grand and creepy.Excellent interpretation, and the cast playing multiple roles AND being the orchestra, is a refreshing stroke of brilliance. Amazing what can be done in the theater!!!"
5,Buy it! See it!,"We bought this cast album after seeing it in New York last month. I love the original cast album with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn, and at first resisted the idea of Patti LuPone as Mrs. Lovett (saw her perform in the role in San Francisco a few years ago and wasn't totally blown away) but in this production, she has totally mastered the part and makes it her own. Michael Cerveris is fabulous, and all the other players sing beautifully as well (best version of ""Green Finch and Linnet Bird"" that I've heard). The stripped-down music works very well indeed, and is even more impressive when you consider the multi-tasking the cast had to do. A winner."
2,Blah!,"Can't stand this recording! I don't why! It just irks me for some reason. It's too damn quiet. That's what it is. Not only the music, but the actors, as well. They are too damn subtle with their characterizations, with the only possible exception being Miss. Lupone. I'd much rather listen to the fully orchestrated recording, and watch the full length show on DVD."
5,Best Recording I Have Ever Heard,"The orchestrations are breathtaking. The cast members act, sing, and play instruments! What talent! Michael Cerveris is phenomenal! Patti LuPone is amusing and wonderful as always as Sweeney's pie shop sweetie. Manoel Felciano is heartbreaking as Tobey, performing the best rendition of ""Not While I'm Around"" that i have ever heard. Lauren Molina is equally talented as she brings a delicate, yet exotic soprano to the beautiful character of Joanna. I am so happy that i had the pleasure of seeing this in New York and meeting this ever-so-talented cast. How come they left out some of the dialogue/music towards the end? They did not include the Parlor Songs or Tobey in the bakehouse on this recording. Oh well, the music they do give us is positively spectaculer. I love Sweeney Todd!!!!!"
2,Is it just me?,"I'm sorry, but this rendition doesn't compare to the original cast recording with Cariou and Lansbury. Is it just me or are most of the voices terrible on this new recording? I generally like LuPone but she tends to run flat. Whoever sings the role of Antony is horrid on Joanna and Kiss Me. Again, he's flat. I've heard good things about the stage production, but I'm not sure it translates well to CD."
2,Buy the original cast recording,"Honestly, I don't think that this new production of ""Sweeney"" works. I miss the dark, lush, sweeping, creep orchestrations of the original. As far as casting, this cast isn't nearly as good. Angela Lansbury is far more convincing and funny as Mrs. Lovett than Patti LuPone. Michael Cerveris is too young to play Sweeney, but he sure tries. The rest of the cast is fine, I guess. No matter what the critics say, this production of ""Sweeney Todd,"" and its cast recording leaves a lot to be desired, and no, it isn't nearly as good as the original, nor is it as thrilling."
3,Maybe I am too attached to the original production.,"I wanted to like this more than I did, and I have the same reaction to the revival. Somehow, the revival and this recording extract all sense of ""the human"" from this show. Both on stage and in this recording, I see gimmickry (e.g. on stage--the Brechtian tendency of characters not to address each other or make full dramatic use of the stage; on stage and on this recording--the minimalist orchestrations, or a female Perelli). The gimmicky, in turn, detracts from the telling of a delightfully macabre and eerie story. And while I have no qualms with Lupone or Cerveris on stage, in this recording their characterizations somehow seem flat. I don't get the dramatic vigor, the emotional range--the ""humanness"" that the original recording provides."
3,Someone has to write a lesser review...let it be me,"I, like everyone, was thrilled to learn of the new production, staging, concept. I flew my old body to NYC to catch the revival. I have concluded that this version is totally dependent on your having thrilled to the original. While much of the staging is very clever and the stage is just one meat pie shy of a fully energetic cast, something nagged at me...Mrs. Lovett. Can that be the real Patti LuPone? She acted dull and bored, and delivered her lines and sang as such. I looked forward to OCR to catch her at the top of her game, and found out she really is dull and bored as Mrs. Lovett. I just cannot love it. But give it a go. This OCR still beats lisitng to the Master's own voice."
3,its good...but the new sweeney is bettter,"The Sweeney todd soundtrack is wayyyy better than this one, I have both, both are great. However, this sweeney is not that ""touching""."
2,The picture looks better than what really is,"The picture of the product looks much better than what it really is. When I got it, the quality is not what I expected and it does not fit my truck, so I return it."
3,British sepllings in an American book?!,"This book would be worth 5 stars......if all the resources were usable. However, several things are not reproducible because they contain British spellings (colour, behaviour, organise, etc.) This seems to be a major oversight in the printing process. For example, the center labels are wonderful, but center is spelled ""centre"" on each and thus I cannot use them. Great book....but a terrible disappointment with the unusable materials with British spelling!"
3,Great,This book has some great tips and also a lot of lesson starters making it a lot easier then creating your own just photocopy and use thank you
3,"Cute children, parents very retro","While the ""Family Circus"" cartoons still remain cute in terms of the actions of the children, the roles of the parents were passed by long ago. That is nowhere more apparent than in the cartoon that has the entire group on a trip in a camper that is in the back of a pickup. It is raining outside, so the entire group is making do inside the camper. The place is a mess, there are dirty dishes piled up everywhere and the mother is trying to hold and diaper the screaming infant while working in the sink with the other hand. At the same time the father is lying on the bed reading a newspaper.As time moves on, children really do not change; their actions remain constant and entertaining. However, the dramatic change in gender roles since the sixties render many of the actions of the parents quaint and too retro to be funny."
4,Awesome fun for couples,My wife and I watch this video all the time and it really gets us going. My wife and I have even watched several of the parts in slow motion over and over again and talk about how terrific the girls look while we are intimate together. The best thing about the girls on this tape is that most of them really look like they are having fun with each other.
4,"The dog likes it, so I'm happy.","I bought the comb because our little sweetie really hates the slicker brush. She is much happier when I use this. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is huge -- 12"" long! -- and with a toy poodle, that's ridiculous. But it makes her fluffy, and doesn't bother her, so that's that!"
5,OTC 6900,"This socket is a must have if you are going to be working on the new Fords, since they have the bright idea to put in a 9/16"" spark plug!"
3,Helpfull,"Not a bad tool, but still had to add another extension to it. If you already have a spark plug socket and extensions just use what you got. On the plus side I got all the plugs out without having one break."
4,Good tool but needs one thing to be great,This is a good tool because the extension is securely fixed to the socket. The only improvement that it needs is to make the rubber insert a little tighter to make it better as it cannot grab the spark plug to remove it from the engine.
3,Good tool to go with the Lisle 6500,"I bought this socket/extension with the Lisle plug removal tool and I am glad I did. Along with other extensions, It helps you keep the torque at a right angle to the center line of the spark plug. This tool does not take the place of the Lisle tool, but it may make its use somewhat less probable. For the price, it is worth it, especially when you consider what you would have to fork over to a Ford dealer to change your plugs. Just keep in mind that it does not do what the Lisle tool does.JimA"
3,doesn't have a swivel head,It's a quality tool. Well made and really grips the spark plug. I just wish it had a swivel head.
5,Must have,This tool is a must have if replacing plugs on your 3v triton motor. It makes an already tough job a little easier. Keeps you from fishing out conventional deep sockets.
4,Met my needs,This product was the right length alone for the hard to reach back spark plugs and worked great with other extensions for the forward plugs. Recommend it!
4,Good Tool,"This fixed 9/16 socket is great for extracting the deep-well 5.4 Ford plug. However, if you are installing none MotorCraft sparkplugs, you will probably need a 5/8 plug socket."
5,Must have for Ford Triton engines,"The socket on this wrench is 9/16"" which is the size of the stock Motorcraft sparks plug. Curious, since the size of the aftermarket spark plugs (I used the Champion 7989 plugs) are 5/8"". This socket is beneficial because the plugs are so deep in the intake, it would be problematic to remove the socket if a socket and extension were used and the socket separated from the extension. That's one of those don't ask me how I know that observations. Regardless, you will still need several length of extensions and a lot of patience. I have a 2005 Expedition and it took me about 3 hours to replace eight plugs. The two rear plugs were ridiculous. I had to remove the vehicle control module to even get to #5 and #7 plugs and #8 plug required this socket, a universal and a long extension to be able to get it out. I highly recommend having this socket available when you do your plug replacement. BTW, the dealer wanted $300 PER PLUG to replace the plug and coil-on-plug."
1,Very disappointed.,"I only bought and read this book because it was on a list of suggested reading in order to take and pass a nutrition exam. Unfortunately, it was of no value. The author, Cheryl Townsley, is not noted in this book as being a nutritionist, which shows. She mentions that fructose is a refined sugar to be avoided. There are too many references to God, prayer, and revelation. Also, you cannot begin to count the many references to the author's parent company for additional products you can buy. I will however, try some of the recipes, as they do sound interesting and healthy for kids."
2,Too Many References to the Author's Company,"I chose this book as a second book to read for a Children's Nutrition class. I really wish I would have chosen a different book.The book had way too many references to the author's own company and website. She spent half of the book trying to convince you to change what your child eats in the first place, with very basic explanations as to why you should make the changes. In my opinion, if someone is looking for a book to read on children's nutrition, they've already decided that they want to make the change.She does give some decent recipes and alternatives to common junk food.There are so many really well done books out there on how to get your child to eat healthy; this is not one I would recommend."
4,great ideas for children's nutrition,I purchased this book to obtain a nutrition certification. I occasionally use it as a reference book. It would be especially useful to people who are just beginning to help their family eat more healthful.
4,Excellent & Unique,"This is a unique collection on an interesting subject. As in any edited volume, some chapters are better than others. I was surprised by the low paternity assurance of some studies, and the insights into human evolution and anatomy are fascinating. For example, why are human penises so much larger than in other apes? And why are human females menstrual rather than estrual? I wish the copy I read was mine and not in a library."
5,Makes ordinary rice extraordinary!,"I've used this product for years, and can't find a better accompaniment to white rice other than soy sauce or teriyaki. The wasabi is subtle, the sesame seeds are perfect, and the nori just makes it all the better. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an authentic Japanese flavor without having to go out to a Japanese restaurant."
3,Prompt delivery,I tried it and didn't care for it much. Has a strange fishy taste and didn't come with instructions. Didn't make the rice taste like wasabi at all.
1,Wasabi Fumi Furikaki,"I did NOT like the flavor of this compared to other brands we normally get from Japan (did not realize this was made in China when we purchased it). This was WAY too sweet - there is a lot of sugar in it. This product should be spicy/seaweedy, not sweet!! I'm trying to get my 10 year old to eat it all so I can buy the good stuff."
5,Got me playing better.,This is the 3rd clawhammer banjo book I purchased. The first was a total fail and the second one got me playing but in a very simple way. When I purchased the book I decided to pretty much ignore everything else I had learned (since it was not all that good to begin with) and start fresh.I am progressing slower than my previous book but I think in the long run it will make me a better player. I do wish it had a CD of music/examples (like other books have) but there is a companion DVD set available which I will be purchasing as well.
4,an interesting perspective....,"the book was rather intriguing,and i liked the characters ecspecially the heroine!!! She was great, extremely well-developed character. This book wasn't a bad buy. I'd reccomend it to my friends for some light reading!!!"
4,Improvement on a good first book,"Juliet McKenna manages to improve on her first book with another based on the same characters, although with a different main character this time around. When she concentrates on Ryshad's story, everything comes together very well, especially his adventures in the Aldabreshi islands. The Aldabreshi society (which was not described in the first book) seems much more internally complex than that of the countries/regions where the characters live. The story of Temar is a little distracting in the beginning since it's hard to tell what's going on, but once the two storylines link up first in Aldabreshi then in Kel Ar'Ayen, things move along much better. I don't care for the inclusion of old manuscripts that have only marginal bearing on the story, though. They would be better shortened to chapter headings rather than multipage introductions. I'm definitely looking forward to the third book."
3,A Difficult Review,"I've had this book for over a year and after several stops and starts, finally finished. The bottom line is ""The Swordsman's Oath"" is just not as good as the previous novel in the series. I liked the story and the characters, who really seem to live and breathe, but Juliet McKenna really has overwritten the narrative this time around. The 500+ page book would have been greatly improved by the editing of 50-75 pages of unnessary detail. On the positive side, the author really knows how to write for character, especially Ryshad this time around. Every one appearing along the way is fully realized and three dimensional. It seems this book has introduced more than a few characters who may be major players in future volumes. So, not as good does not mean bad, only more...challenging than what has past. Recommended."
4,Swordsman's Oath,"I love Juliet's books. Especially the fact that if you know a bit of history, and you really get into the book, you'll realize it's like what happened with The Lost Colony. Her books are based in something like a parrallel dimension. Actually, Mid 17th century Europe. I mean, the clothes, the food, even the currency corresponds with that time period. If you don't believe me then do some of yer own research!~Plague2032"
4,Another Excellent Offering,"This, the second book in the (five book, I believe) series relating the story of the thief Livak and her entourage, was just as good as the first one. Which is, in my opinion, high praise. It actually follows more closely one of the cohorts, only mentioning Livak occasionally in passing, but it's a fascinating read, and explores parts of Einarinn unvisited in the first book. If you're a fantasy fan, definitely pick up book one. If you like that, you'll like book two as well. On a side note, it's nice to see so many fantasy books nowadays put women in a heroic role. (Livak, the central character of book one, is a female.)"
3,Only ok,This is my first blue tooth so it could be me....but I asked my son who uses one daily and he could not help me figure it out.Sometimes it works fine-sometimes not.I have read the limited instructions multiple times but to no avail.
2,Read a little,"This product is not that good. Don't get me wrong it is nice to have bluetooth but you get what you pay for. It doesn't not link with my motorola well and the connection is always cracky. I upgraded not to long ago and the problem has stopped. So, save yourself some time and get the newer versions!!"
3,Decent headset,I think this headset is very light and has killer looks. Works well most of the times and hearing is good. The only issue I have encountered so far is that at times people think I am talking from far away like on a speaker phone.
2,Good product dont buy from ccmaccesories!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this is a review of what happen to me when i received this product from ccmaccessories. i got this product then it didn't work. it was supposed to be new but it wasn't it didn't work. i called them up they sent me another one and the same thing happen again. finally i just sent it back and bought one at target works great!! DO NOT BUY from ccmaccessories BEWAREEEE!!!!if it actually worked it would be great but it didn't so o well be careful shopping on amazon!!
5,very good purchase,"This is the first bluetooth I have ever purchased, and it works great. I can hear people clearly, and people hear me."
2,Disappointing,"Even tho I found this movie by stumbling upon it I was looking forward to watching it because Penelope Cruz is one of my favorite actresses. However, I was totally disappointed. The story made no sense as it wandered from one scene to the next with no continuity. I never could figure out how the scene where Lupe had scrawled a message on the mirror fit in with the rest of the movie. The entire 'love' between the two seemed forced and not real. Talk about miscasting! Adrien Brody may look like Manolete, but the chemistry between him and Cruz simply did not exist. The scenery was beautiful--that's about all that was worthwhile about this film."
1,AWFUL,This was so badly written that I quite watching it about half way through. It was also derivetive and boring and both leads looked as though they wished they were in a different movie. Urgh.
1,where's the bull?,I too found it boring and couldn't wait for it to be over. I didn't care at all about the sickening romance between the 2 stars. The Matador character enraged me with his constant whispering. And what happened to the bull in the climactic scene? Was he really that insignificant as a character that we don't need to know?
1,Disapponting,"When I first heard that this film was being made, I was thrilled. Then when I couldn't see it in theatres I was upset but knew that eventually I would get to see it on DVD and now I wished I'd never seen it at all. I don't even know what this was. It was so horribly edited and chopped up that I had no idea what was going on. I've read reviews from people in other countries who saw the movie in the theatre and this video is NOT that movie. What a shame for both Adrien Brody and Penelope Cruz. This dvd does not do their careers justice."
3,Boring,"As the title says; the whole movie is just about Manolete's Mistress.The movie is boring and shows nothing about the art of bullfighting.Everybody in the movie achieves at giving their worst possible acting.Hard to beliee that Adrien Brody and Penelope Cruz both have won Oscars.The biggest disappointment besides the screenplay is the direction.I couldn't wait for it to be over.However; the quality of the BluRay is good, very good picture quality and very good sound."
2,Not too exciting,"The book Journey into Terror by Bill Wallace is about a twelve year old boy whose parents are divorced. In this book Sam, the main character is at the air port waiting for his plane to visit his dad. While he was waiting he decided to take some pictures whith the camera he got from his dad. He took a picture of two Lear jets whith some guys in the middle of the two Lear jets.Sam took a picture of the wrong guys, they were after him. I didn't really like this book. I thought the author left out to many detals. I wouldn't recommend this book to any one but thats just my opinion."
4,Very good!,"I really enjoyed this book. Even though in the begining Alice was convinced that she would hate her pare-shaped teacher Mrs. Plotkin, as the story goes on she learns that looks are only skin deep! I'm looking forward to reading more Alice books in the future!"
5,By a 4th grader in Mrs. Marta's class,"I read Journey into Terror and it was great! It's about a boy named Samuel Ross whose parents are divorced. When he's visiting his dad, before he gets on the plane, he snaps two pictures of Learjets. When he is with his dad, he finds out he has a brother named Gary who is goofy and silly. Also he finds out he won a contest for a picture. He lies to his dad about what he took for the photograph. Soon four thugs come and are looking for a picture that someone took. This book is exciting and you should read this to find out what happens next!Caleb4th GraderIshpeming, MI"
4,Bought for son,"I bought this book for my son. I didn't read it, but he said it was a very good book, so I gave it a four star rating."
5,"This is a great book full of action, mystery and suspense!.",I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy suspense and action. I think it's good for ages 10 and older.
1,Boring - Annoying,"I usually love Kathy Reichs books. This one I found incredibly boring, pedantic and uninteresting. The dialogue between Tempe and Ryan peculiar to say the least, staccato, juvenile and ridiculous. The storyline could have been told in 100 pages. Tempe came across as a know it all and lectured at every oportunity, half of which was incomprehensible to the layperson. Also some of the comments made couldn't be connected to the conversation. In actual fact had I been given the book without being told the author I would never have recognised it as being written by Kathy Reichs. Very disappointing."
3,Not the typical storyline,"I had the opportunity to buy the series of Kathy Reichs' books all at one shot, and, since I have the full series, it made sense for me to read them in order. I just finished her eighth book, Cross Bones. Dr. Tempe Brennan, Reichs' main character, is pulled into the investigation of the murder of a Jewish importer. An old photo from an archeological dig in Israel in the 1960s seems to be the key to the case. Brennan finds herself in Israel pursuing clues that could have significant impact on several of the world's religions. Cross Bones is significantly different than earlier Reichs' books and seems to be an effort to capitalize on the popularity of the Da Vinci Code. I think she should stick with the type of storyline that made her popular."
3,Reading with Tequila,"I like the Temperance Brennan novels more when they are set in the south, than when they are set in Canada. I enjoy them less when the character travels to foreign lands. The religious tones in this book were a little more than my agnostic mind could manage. I had to really struggle to remember the bible teachings of my youth to follow some of what was going on."
1,a rare miss by Kathy Reichs,"Loved all of her books thus far, but this one was dull as dishwater. The characters kept summarizing events throughout the whole book; I guess we, the readers, are too dumb to remember the plot. I had to force myself to finish this book, and even read a complete book during one of the lulls in which I couldn't handle reading more of this story. I hope the rest of her books are better, as I've already purchased them, based on her books before this one."
4,Not Reich's Best,"Kathy Reichs is a fantastic author. Her books are marvelous, and now, so is her television show. However, this book left me disappointed slightly. The story was good and well written, as always, but left a lot to be desired compaired to some of her other books like Fatal Voyage! Well worth the read."
1,"Tedious, messy and confusing...","Tedious, messy and confusing are not good words to describe a novel. Unfortunately, this was not a good novel and the words do apply. I have ready all of the past Kathy Reichs books and generally they were very good. I think she tried to stretch Tempe too much in this book. She had her delving into areas that were way over her head. I knew things were going to get overly complex when she had Tempe and Ryan go off to Israel together.If this had been a tightly written, fast paced novel, it would have helped the subject matter. But, it was rambling, confusing, and did not hold my interest. I found myself skimming through parts and finally I decided to check the last few pages to see if a rousing finale would prompt me to keep reading. What I read at the end was not encouraging, but I did plod through the book. I guess everyone can have a 'miss' in a long row of hits. I hope Kathy gets back to basics with good solid stories and mysteries with her next book."
2,sad,"This must be one of the latest entries in the Dan Brown school of writing. Name an expert, assign an audience, lecture on historical points and expect applause at the end. Well, Kathy Reichs can wait for a long time. There will be no applause for this book. I would like my money back. I'm almost finished and still can't really figure out what the plot actually is. I guess she will just pop the final lecture and the conclusion will name the murderer. What about motive, character development (sex + history), etc... This is my first novel by this author and it will be my last."
3,Interesting because I was traveling to Israel but . . .,"I purchased the book because I was going to Israel. I found it a bit hard to follow. It seemed somewhat disjointed, no pun intended, and it was hard to keep all the players sorted out. It could be due to the fact that I was reading it in bits and pieces. I felt like Kathy was trying to get all the facts in harder than telling a good story. I noticed at the end of the book that it was based on real discoveries and archaeological information. So perhaps my observation that she wanted to get all the facts in was correct. The relationships and story bits were the best part. Although the history, as I was in-country, were enlightening as well."
5,kept me intrigued,One of Ms. Reich's best that I have read so far. Characters had depth and it took most of the book for me to figure out who the bad guys were.
2,just like another book...,"Cross Bones, in the first 46 pages, came across like a book I had read in the '80s. Sure enough, I amazon-searched the books and lo and behold, I found ""The Body"" by Richard Sapir, written in 1984. First of all, I'm a Kathy Reichs-Tempe Brennan freak. Love the stories! But this one... not so much. Too much like ""The Body"" to be totally comfortable with the story. I'll go ahead and finish reading (not much left to finish), but am very disappointed in what is almost a copycat book. Oh yeah, there was a movie ""The Body"" in 2001 (Richard Sapir's book). Will rent it to see how much of Tempe Brennan is in it. If you can overlook the love interests, The Body is a much better read!!"
2,Very Disappointing,"This is a very difficult, convoluted plot with a very disappointing ending. I do not recommend it."
2,Everything that can go wrong...did.,"I couldn't wait for this book. Kathy Reichs is on my short list of excellent mystery writers. (That list includes Henning Mankell, Peter Robinson, the late Batja Gur, Donna Leon.) When Cross Bones arrived, I dug in and quickly discovered a dull story stretched thin. How many times must the author lay out plot and characters? Ms. Reichs, trust your reader. What pained me most was that I actually took a strong dislike to Tempe. Her 'quick wit' came across as sarcasm (without the wit) and her new 'super-cool' attitude was annoying. It won't be the last time I read Kathy Reichs...an author can't be expected to get it right every time...but I do hope that the next book in this series gives us the Tempe I knew and cared about."
3,Loose ends...,"I'm a Reichs fan and have read all her previous books. I found the plot in this one a little far fetched. The characters are one-dimensional, as another reviewer commented, but what I found most disappointing was how Reichs didn't ""wrap it up"" properly in the end. There was still some loose ends in my opinion. I give it a weak 3 star simply because of Reichs ability to keep the suspense and excitement as the story goes along. Too bad the ending isn't better."
3,Doesn't Deliver the Expected Punch,"The summary of the book makes this book seem as though it's a lot more exciting than the book actually is. Considering the genre, Ms. Reich's book is certainly more interesting than the average Patricia Cornwell offering, if for no other reason than it includes some intriguing spiritual notions and forrays into antiquity. However, this story is sadly less intriging when stripped of these and the exotic locales. Indeed, if Ms. Reich had not thrown some very big red herrings into the mix, the ""mystery"" would have been so plain and obvious that it might have qualified as a documentary.In summary, it's not a bad book, but it's certainly a let down if you were expecting a story as exciting as the one suggested on the book jacket."
3,Should have been better,"I have enjoyed each book in this series and eagerly await new ones. I was very disappointed in this one. First, I had just finished reading a very well written book, and the contrast seemed extreme when I began reading this one. It almost seemed like a first draft of a novel. The writing just wasn't very good. Re the christianity/history problems, well, this is just a novel. We can all suspend disbelieve and read a novel within the context of its own world. But still, it did all seem rather silly. Yes, it did kind of seem like a Da Vinci rip off. And that is hard to say, given that Reichs (even at her worse) is a world above Mr. Brown's style. Having said all that, the forensic info was, as always, very interesting. I just wish she would stick with Montreal. I missed those characters a lot. I now look forward to her next book. I hope it is better."
2,Cross Bones by Kathy Reichs,"Probably the least satisfactory of her books, Cross Bones is an obvious attempt to cash in on the Da Vinci Code craze (the latter book being a fictional work with a predictable plot based on Holy Blood, Holy Grail, which in turn was based on a MUCH older book, Sang Real). I was disappointed in this book because all of her previous books were well written with well thought out plots and evenly paced. This one was like she had a premise and tried to craft a story around it. The story was erratic and the pacing uneven and it was hard to work up enthusiasm. In short, I could put it down and do other things very easily. Normally I can't when I get one of her books, but have to read it cover to cover. I do hope the next book will be better and this isn't an example of what things will be like now she has a tv show based on her character."
1,Is the author a sports reporter?,"You know how sports reporters have about 1000 words they use in the place of ""beat,"" as is ""Seattle beat Tampa?"" This is how Reichs writes her book. She uses the most ridiculous ""synonyms"" for whatever verbs she is intending to mean. It all became very tedious.I was also bored several times throughout the book as Temperance Brennan runs through a summary of the case so far by asking herself about 2 dozen questions, the same 2 dozen questions each time she reviews the case.I don't mind relatively simple murder mysteries, but this just barely held my interest."
1,Not up to speed,"This is the weakest Reichs book I've read. It quickly became apparent that the big mystery at the heart of the book would remain unsolved and the small solvable mystery pushed aside most of the way would be resolved with all the intrigue that drove the book would be a false trail. Brennan's room is trashed, she is followed, she is captured by the bad person, another character saves her, Ryan wants sex, Brennan rolls her eyes often. You've read it before in better stories."
2,A Jumbled Mess,"Dr. Temperance Brennan is given a photograph of what appears to be an ancient skeleton. She and Detective Andrew Ryan travel to Israel and begin an investigation of its origins. Kathy Reichs has jumped on the Da Vinci Code bandwagon with dismal results. I was surprised this story was such a jumbled mess. Reichs' books are usually very good. As if the convoluted plot was not bad enough, the characters go over the clues again and again. It's as if the author thought the reader would have trouble following the story if she didn't repeat the steps in the plot at every turn. Some serious students or archaeology or anthropology might find something of interest in this book, but they will have to wade through a lot of nonsense to get to it."
1,Tedious,Don't waste your time reading this novel. I was looking forward to the latest episode in the Tempe Brennan series and was extremely disappointed. There were no elements of mystery or suspense and it was so boring. I would only recommend this book if you have insomnia.
2,Bit of a let down after Monday Mourning,"The latest story from Kathy Reichs is not nearly as suspenseful as her previous book - Will authors please depart from the ""secret ancient discovery theme""? This is no DaVinci Code and while the story which unfolds about the Masada is intriguing, the theories are lame. Pick this one up at the library or wait for the paperback, not worth the hardcover cost"
2,Disappointing,"The eighth book in Kathy Reichs' Dr. Temperance Brennan series is too much an obvious follow-on to ""The Da Vinci Code"" and too little a Tempe Brennan suspense thriller. The plot starts out interestingly enough, a murder perhaps caused by an ancient biblical mystery and the discovery of bones possibly belonging to Jesus Christ - and on Masada no less. But the story becomes confusing, too contrived, and ends with little resolved except the identify of the killer who started the entire search, something that I thought was pretty obvious from the beginning.All in all, I thought this book was an unthrilling read."
2,Disappointing,This was a disappointment from a usually good author. If you really want to read Cross Bones-get it from the library.I recommend you try one of Beverly Connors instead.
1,Not a good read.,"At times, I thought I knew more about the main character's sex life with a detective than I had about the case at hand. I can never start a book and not finish, but from about page 40 onward, I wished that I had never started this one. I have never read anything by Kathy Reichs before...the plot was great, it is what drew me to the book. But, her manner of writing and her methods for suspense were below par."
2,I just didn't like it,"I've read all of Reichs' other books and really enjoyed them. I had a really hard time getting into this one though. While clever, in parts, the book just didn't hold my interest."
1,"Interesting idea, shame about the book","Kathy Reichs is a better writer than this. The book starts off with an intriguing idea, then dissolves into a convoluted mess. I finished it because I wanted to see how it ended, but I wouldn't recommend it.While the research for this must have been interesting and time consuming, the end result is: could have done better. Overall it smacks of meeting a deadline."
5,WoW!,"She just keeps getting better and better,,,could hardly put this one down. The forensic/biblical/historial background is fascinating: some of it was stuff I knew or sort of, and some was very enlightening. A great, roller-coaster read...I think she is better than Cornwell now."
3,Cross Bones,"It was very interesting, but you were wishing there would be some kind of answer at the end. Found the ending to be disappointing because one set of bones is recovered by the zealots and the other is burned, so you have no clue about what could have happened or who the skeletons could have belonged to."
2,Cross Bones,"Not nearly as good as her previous novels. It has too many historical references which are difficult to keep in mind, too many unfamiliar names of the characters, and too much foreign language. I think you should wait for her next book and hope for better things."
2,I cannot believe....,"....that the average reader will get a lot of enjoyment from this book. The premise was promising, but the journey was lacking. Believe me, readers, you are going to be bored out of your skull with all of the DNA information. Even with my medical background, I was to the point of just skipping over sections. Actually tried to skip a few but lost the thread, had to back up and reread...tedious. Lesson from a famous trial, most people do not understand or even care about DNA. The ending was also less than satisfying. Of course, writing a book about this subject is a kind of no-win situation, and I am sure Ms. Reich's research was extensive, but...I was disappointed."
3,Not as enjoyable as the others for me,"I have all the Kathy Reichs books and love them all, and the new TV series, but I didn't enjoy this one as much as the others. I studied to be an archaeologist, so that aspect was interesting, but for some reason I just didn't like this one as much. I think it was the fact that Tempe didn't seem to be as emotionally invested in the outcome as usual. Obviously these kind of professionals become invested in their cases, and I think Reichs' books do a good job of showing that without being too syrupy about it. But these bones were an academic question more than a criminal question, so the usual sense of urgency was missing. Not her best, but still good."
2,Temperance Brennan is Losing Her Touch,"I too have read all of the Temperance Brennan series and I concur that this is the weakest novel of the series. The plot is convoluted, the forensic science is arcane to the point of boredom and, most disappointingly, Temperance and Ryan are little more than stick figures.One of the delights of this series is the alternatively humorous and painful tension which exists between Temperance and her Montreal confreres. That is completely missing here as Temperance and Ryan embark upon a sojurn to Israel which becomes progessively more unrealistic.I hate to say this, but it seems to me that Temperance may have contracted a case of Scarpettaitis - a world where verisimilitude is anathema. I hope that the next volume in this series refocuses on the character of Temperance Brennan.I do not recommend this book."
2,Not As Good As Some Of Her Others-More Indiana Jones Than Tempe Brennan,"I'm sorry, but I just couldn't get into this story. Way too much ancient history and too many Hebrew names. In my opinion, solving the murder(s) appears to end up taking a back seat to endless theorizing over the identity of the bones in question. Also, the following quote (in one form or another) is spoken too many times:""OMG, If these are the bones of Jesus, it'll make the Vatican wet its pants.""No offense, but I got it the first time.I'm still a fan of this series, and I'm not going to give up on it yet. I just hope that this series isn't going to follow the same path to self-destruction that Patricia Cornwell's forensic series did.As I've said before, here's hoping the next one will be better."
3,Cross Bones,"I love Kathy Reichs and read all of her books. I found this one to be overly complicated and too ""DiVinci Code."""
1,A disappointment,"Having been a fan of Kathy's books from the first, I anxiously await each new book from her. Sadly, I was extremely disappointed in ""Cross Bones"". It is a blatant but inadequate attempt to jump on the ""The Da Vinci Code"" bandwagon.Kathy labors so hard to make the various plot points sound plausible you can actually sense her breaking into a sweat. I found myself looking forward to the end of the book.I am sorry to advise, don't waste your money or your valuable time on this one."
3,A little too slow,"I have always enjoyed anything written by Kathy Reichs, and since I loved The Davinci Code, I thought this would be spectacular. However, I found the plot slow and in parts, boring."
3,Least favorite so far,Usually a page turner I am trying to read these in order and this one really was hard to get interested into (for me). The previous book was excellent and I hope the next one is just as good as others.
2,For PhDs only,"Reichs is an awesome writer, and her skill with plotting and words still shone through this somewhat convoluted storyline. There were simply too many people, too many plot twists, too many historical references and figures, and too many unfamiliar terms for me to keep straight. I found myself racing to the end to finish. And I was sure glad when I could mark this ""done."" If you have a degree in religion, archaeology, or Jewish history, you'll probably keep up just fine. But for us mere mortals, it was way over my head."
1,"BAD, BORING AND ANTI RELIGIOUS","Reichs is usually a good beach read. In ""Cross Bones"" she doesn't just stumble, she falls flat on her face. It's a rip off of ""The Da Vince Code"", only without the excitement.Tempe investigates a set of ancient bones she suspects may be those of Jesus Christ. The book is dotted with nasty religious fanatics. Reichs apparently hates believers so much she cannot type the words ""Jewish"" and ""Christian"" without adding the word ""fanatic"".One of the major problems with the book is that it revolves around the ossuary recently found that was supposed to be hold the bones of Jesus' brother. Alas for Reichs, the owners of the ossuary have recently been indicted for forgery."
4,Cross Bones - a very good read somewhat relevant to recent headlines.,Good book. Not her best but definately action packed. Relevant to recent headlines regarding the Gaza strip. A good continuance to the Tempe/Ryan relationship as well.
1,Bad writing!,"What a horrible writer! I got so sick of the one word sentences, and the constant cussing wasn't necessary and didn't add much to the boring characters anyway. I read the whole book, even though I didn't enjoy a single page b/c I wanted to get my money's worth. I would never recommend this book to anyone! What a waste of time and money."
1,Poorly written - opinionated - disorganized,"Prof. Mitchell's casebook is a waste of money. The book doesn't teach you corporate law, as it should. Instead it teaches you what corporate law SHOULD be, according to Mitchell. The book contains cases inappropriate to the subject matter for which it is included - cases you won't find in any other corporate law text book.The chapters are disorganized and subjects are dissected and scattered.The book entirely ignores statutes.I had Mitchell as a professor at GW Law School, and was forced to read his terrible book. I've learned absolutely nothing about Corporations in this class."
2,1 of 2 Defective,"I ordered 2 of the items and when i set the codes, only one of the items worked. I am now trying to find a battery (hoping that is the problem) but i cannot find the right one."
3,ok movie,I am a huge Devon Sawa fan I Had never heard of this movie so I decided to give it a try it was ok but not one of my favorites. If you have never seen it i would its ok but not that impressive.
4,I can't say it enough - Palmer is great at this stuff!!!,After reading my first Palmer book I was hooked. I've been addicted ever since. My paperback goes everywhere I do. Thanks Michael Palmer! Don't ever stop!
2,Started well enough,"By about two-thirds of the way into this book, it fell into the usual medical thriller cliches we've all read a hundred times, not to mention the main character of the book is followed around for most of it being told her worth in her marriage is amount to squeezing out a baby for her spineless husband.This isn't quite as bad as some of Robin Cook's stinkers, but overall it just wasn't very good."
2,Not a good read.,"This book was Michael Palmer's worst. The book begins in Germany during WWII with Nazi doctors conducting experiments on humans. Then, forty years later the story continues. Usually his books are full of suspense and drama. This book lacked both. I kept reading it in hopes that it would get better. Unfortunately, it didn't. I don't recommend this book to anyone."
3,Vanilla,rate this book against the other books Michael Palmer has written re. medical thrillers this one is ho hum.I like more action attached to the story
5,Michael Palmer,I do enjoy medical suspense books. Michael Palmer is one of the best. I have not been disappointed in any of his books I've read.
5,Very well writing as always by Michael Palmer,I have read all o;f Michael Palmer's books to date. I always look forward to his next work. I find him to be an excellent author who will give us much more to be enthrolled with.
4,Good Read!,"The book is very good as many are from Ellen Gunderson Traylor. It has brought alive many of the Bible's heroes. The only bad thing about the book are the numerous typographical errors - more than I've seen in any book. They don't take away from the stories, but one of the sections is entitled David and the Ark: 100 BCE (yes, one hundred.) Traylor's best book was John Son of Thunder...too bad its not still in print."
4,"As always, Amazon delivers","The package arrived via international shipping well within the estimated time.There was, however, some damage to the DVD boxes (corners slightly dented), so they looked like they actually had journeyed across the Atlantic...The DVD collection, which I already watched years ago, is incredible. The first time I watched them I nearly had a simultaneous stroke and hernia from laughing so hard.It's that funny."
2,The perfect thing for my counter but.......,"Going to be getting new counters soon so wanted something transparent and durable to protect the area that gets the most use. This was going to be the perfect thing. Looks great, shipped quick and was packed well. Says dishwasher safe...don't put it in the dishwasher. The glued on plastic feet on the under side come off. Don't know what kind of glue they use but it must have been school glue. My repair person is here right now working on my dishwasher. It's brand new and already had to be pulled back out and all the hoses pulled off and the hunt is on for 2 of the 4 plastic feet that came off and are plugging the drain hose. Going to be very expensive repair.....:-("
5,Que bueno que ya no son privados,"Recuerdo escuchar la historia de instructores que se llenavan de orgullo diciendo: El Maestro a mi, me dijo, (refiriendose al libro y su conocimiento) y controlaba de esta forma a todos sus seguidores. Eso se acabó. Ahora el material ya no es privado, ni esclusivo para unos cuantos, ahora les pertenece a los chelas del maestro.Esta serie de libros de Thomas Printz, son de un contenido espeso, para discípulos con aspiraciones a ser chela. Si quieres entrar en lo profundo de éste conocimiento, comienza por el tomo número uno y continua después con los otros. Te encantará."
5,"Helped me get an ""A"" in A&P","I found this book to be very helpful, especially when used with Volume I. I quizzed myself with his questions and answers after I read a chapter, and usually found that I didn't understand a section deeply enough. I'd much rather get questions wrong before the test than during! Many of the questions on the test were very similar to his questions. I'd recommend this Volume & also Volume 1 if you are looking for good grades for A&P. You can't do wrong by learning from a former professor of A&P!"
5,Great cartoon movie,"This is one of those movies that if your a child, and have seen this, you will grow up loving this movie. 20 years later as your walking through a store and see this movie to buy, you just have to have it. I am 16, and I liked it!!"
3,Pfaltzgraff Melissa Soup/Cereal Bowl,"I like the pattern, size and versatility of these bowls. I have used them daily for rice, soup, side dishes, cereals, etc. There are a few things, though, that you cannot know from either the picture or the decription. These bowls don't stack very well and therefore take more space in the cabinet than I would like to give them. And they are a little heavy for this size (which may be a pro for some people). Also, the white finish is much darker than it appears on the picture."
1,JUNK,"This Melissa dinnerware is pure junk, I would suggest that you never buy anything made by this company. It was not usable after a few months time, due to silverware marks all over the dinnerware. The company will sell you cleaner for it but it does not work to remove all the marks and if you work hard and get most of the black marks removed, be sure not to use them again or the marks are back and they can sell more of their cleaner. Just better not to buy their products as you will trash them after a few months as I have had to do. The finish on their product is very poor. What a waste of money!"
3,What shipping cost!,The white bleach works well but the septic tank ones which I think are green and the blue ones don't seem to do anything. Once you buy the system you are stuck in a trap because you have to continue buying the refills forever and they aren't cheap PLUS there is shipping in here. Lowe's has them where they keep the toilet parts. They aren't stupid. They realize the white ones work well so they charge a couple bucks extra for them. Walmart once had the same cartridges for a system called Kaboom (I think) but I can't find them there anymore. My local Walmart has been getting rid of things at a rapid pace for some reason (and without using their brains) so I don't know if this kind is made anymore or if the idiots just removed them from the store.
1,No Returns for Wrong Product,"Blue cartridges were received instead of bleach, but returns are not allowed. There should be some recourse for a mistake made by the shipper. Otherwise, we are forced to pay for whatever they wish to ship."
4,Fluidmaster 8102 Bowl Refil Cartridge - 2 Pack,"This is a very good product, I've been using it for the last couple of years. It keeps your toilet bowl clean."
2,I got the blues,"This product is made by a company which also makes a similar cartridge in bleach. There is no comparison between their performance. They are designed to keep your toilet bowl clean by dispensing a measured amount of cleaner with each flush. The bleach cartridge keeps the bowl clean for weeks, the blue one keeps the water blue, and that's about it. A third product is made for septic tanks."
1,BLUE does not work,The Blue (8102) does not work to keep bowl clean. But the Bleach (8302) works great.
1,Blue is not so good,"The store that I purchased the blue cartridges from was out of the bleach ones, so I figured, ""why not""? Can't be any different, other than turning the water blue. Big mistake. The blue dye clogs the toilet. So use caution when buying the blue dyed ones. Stick with the bleach."
2,Poor Quality,"These refills do not work as well as expected. I have purchased these in the past because the quality was good. They usually last about 3 months under normal use, however, not this time. Under the same conditions of use as in the past this time it provided blue color in the toilet for less than half the previous amount of time. I no longer recommend this item to others."
2,only one month?,the water turned clear after less than a month. we are two of us and have two bathrooms.worked good for awhile but lost out.
1,Poor usage,I didn't get two weeks usage out of the blue cartridge. It just doesn't last anywhere near the three months you claim it will.
4,Rachel Benjamin super sleuth,"I really like that Red Dress Ink is branching out a little and a chick lit mystery is such a good idea! The Pact is fun and fast paced, all the action takes place from Friday night - Sunday and all the characters are easy to follow. I'll be looking for the next ""Rachel Benjamin mystery""Took a star away because some of the fuzzy details (like ages and dates and the mom's stuffiness at 53 years old?) were distracting."
2,Not Ok.. Waste of time,"This book was almost a complete waste of my time. I wish I wouldn't have read it all the way but I can't stop reading a book though once I start it. Unfortunately, I have to have closure with what I do and always have to finish what I start.The characters are unbelievable and completely into themselves and don't care much about anything outside of the little circle their live revolves around.Now to not be so harsh... this book would pass a few hours time if you needed to fill in airplane hours (that's how long it takes to finish), but don't read it if you're looking for something with substance."
4,Nice change,I liked the spike of mystery with the chick lit. Not too heavy but still keeps you guessing. I wouldn't recommend it to someone expecting Grisham but it was an enjoyable variation of chick lit.
4,Entertaining Mystery,"Rachel Benjamin is dreading her college pals upcoming wedding. Apparently, in all of her friends, no one is looking forward to their nuptials. But when Rachel finds Emma's fiancé dead, floating in the pool, she decides that she is going to find the killer. The worst part, everyone staying at the family's estate, had their reason to finish off Richard.The small group of friends made a pact to stop them from seeing the wrong men. Did someone kill of Richard as part of the pact? Did the best man need the money? What about the man Emma should have married? Apparently, Emma's father did not agree with the wedding either.The Pact keeps you guessing as Rachel tries her hardest to find the killer. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, trying to solve the mystery."
4,The mysterious side of Red Dress Ink,"This is a fun new mystery from Red Dress Ink! Rachel Benjamin isn't too thrilled about her friend's choice of groom, but she's going to be in the wedding anyway. But how happy can she be when he ends up dead the night before the wedding? In this mystery/romance, Jennifer Sturman proves that she is the modern girl's answer to Agatha Christie.Rachel attempts to investigate the crime, mostly for her own purposes, but also because she cares for her friend, too. The result is a funny and ultimately satisfying mystery! This is a nice change of pace from the usual RDI novel. You'll like it!"
5,RVD,"The Pact is the perfect read for a kick back day. I loved the twists and turns, plus the characters were delightful. It is the perfect weekend getaway for when you can't physically get away. Slip it into a beach bag, suitcase or carry on and you're all set. Can't wait for sequels. (Would love to see it on screen/tv someday.) Definately great light reading. Kudos for a wonderful first novel."
1,never received.,"I guess the title says it all. This item came up in a list to review. Don't know why my first review 2 years ago didn't take, but simply put, didn't receive it. That's pretty much all there is to say."
3,"Fun, Quick Read","I loved that this story kept me wondering for so long. There were no ""dead"" spots in the story, it moved along quite nicely, frequently adding new clues to the mystery. At the climax of the story, I serioulsy could not read it fast enough, it was so good! I recommend this to anyone who wants a fun ""whodunit"" to read."
2,Paean to Napoleon,"Several reviewers have cited Mr. Cronin's readability - which is definitely a plus for this volume. However, I didn't find his tone as neutral as did others. It seemed a virtual panegyric of Napoleon, when compared with Frank McLynn's dispassionate tome. I found Mr. Cronin's willingness to buy into much of Napoleonic apocrypha off-putting. Impressive in its personal tone - it's obvious Mr. Cronin is interested & approves of the subject, however, I prefer a bit of objectivity to my history, as far as that is possible."
3,remaster woes,"I have to agree wholeheartedly with the previous review, this amazing album suffers from an extremely poor remaster. Ian McNabb's voice certainly loses it's polish and the instrumentation appears muddy. Strangely, the one track that does stand out is The Needle & The Damage Done on the second CD. It's as if someone else mastered that track.I already own the vast majority of the tracks on vinyl and cassette versions of the original releases but found when all the b-sides and extras are gathered together, the songs sound disjointed. The b-sides of the Up Here in the North of England 12"" sound particularly jarring to me, like a badly performed sonic experiment.On the plus side: the packaging and sleeve notes are excellent, it is certainly a collection worth having, I'll just put my copy of the previously released version of this album in this, much nicer, package."
3,Downhill the series goes...,"Well, with half the series gone and done with i eagerly waited for Vol. 4 of this drug to appear... It did, but only to disappoint. Vol. 1&2 were some of the funniest hours of my viewing life, Vol.3 left much to be desired, and now Vol.4 has made me rethink my wish to buy all the DVDs. The new voice actress for the part of Excel ( who would probably be good as another part) failed to properly fill her predecessors shoes. It seems that a few of the Key voice actors changed. ( these changes of course are only minor since most would rather listen to the original dubbing.) But the humor is also becoming soggy. The laughs are forced, and the humor is less than what should come from the writers of Excel Saga. I only hope that whoever they choose to do the voices for Puni Puni Poemi can do the job.By all means, do watch, but dont be shocked if you find it uneasy to bear the changes."
2,hmmm....,"I absolutely loved the first two volumes. The third was a little watered-down and flat but still managed to be funny at times. I tried to overlook that by anticipating the humour revival in the following volume... only to find I'd been let-down even moreso. This volume is the least funny thus far and has discouraged my determination to collect any more of the series. Excel's voice has changed, it's sort of similar but still noticeably different. There's really only one funny episode and it's only funny compared to the others (otherwise it's not that funny at all), episode 16. Overall, this volume is sloppy, corny and sadly very boring."
3,"It's not the best anime, but who cares??!!","Excel Saga is mostly... well, actually we still don't know what the heck it is. What we know for sure is that it is FUNNY. The animation is really good and the situations are irreverent and comical. Though the story is not what we expected, it is a good anime for those fans who like to buy a movie to have some laughs without thinking too much... just sit back, relax and enjoy the show because it is always a weird and very funny one."
4,Personal Management,"I feel the book hits you in the gut so to speak. Needing to internalize what it is that is causing harm within you and your company. Really teaches you how to utilize the resources within your company. His 8 practices are a simple approach to get you company into shape, starting with you. Reminds me of turning service workers into knowledge workers from a Drucker standpoint, and utilizing your core competencies from a Hamel standpoint."
4,A bit more information and it would have been the best...,"Great book. It takes you through installation, customization and some troubleshooting, and it even manages to explain kernel recompilation in a simple way! If your computer is a simple, bare bones workstation, great. If it's not (and you know it's not) then the book is still great, but not quite complete: a lot of people out there own soundcards, scanners, joysticks and gamepads, and the book says little or nothing about those relevant pieces of hardware. So, it gets 4 stars."
4,"Good for ""Newbies""","I liked the book. The author does take you from basic PC 101 thru Linux.I am an IT pro, and wanted to get a feel for Linux before all of our users started using it. I knew nothing about it, but with the help of this book loaded and configured Linux on a spare pc. I feel prepared thanks to Ricart's book."
4,Good book for Linux newcomers,"A recommended reading after installing Linux Caldera or the KDE desktop. Clearly written, I read half of the book the first night and the second night I was (finally) fine tuning -both, my laptop and Desktop KDE's. I wish the book had expanded on multimedia for linux."
3,For absolute Linux beginners or Caldera OpenLinux users.,If your after a beginners guide to Linux for anything other than Caldera OpenLinux don't buy this book. But if you want a copy of OpenLinux and star office this book is quite good value and gives good coverage of installing with very good instructions for setting up and configuring the software/system.Good for a beginner who knows nothing about Linux or unix and wants to be taken thru step by step installing and setting up Caldera Openlinux or someone who wants an easier to use distribution than most of the others. Also a good book to use for persuading your boss to switch to Linux as nearly anyone should be able to follow the instuctions in this book and get their intel based pc up and running linux. In all is well writen easy to read book which explains all the topics raised in a way most beginners should understand.
2,Very outdated,A mark of something that has little value is a book left behind and or left in a bookcase. Such is the case of this book. I found it and out of boredom gave it a read. It is based of the defunct Caldera release of Linux. There is a CD but the release and the information is dated.About the only value this book would hold is a cheap introduction to basic Linux.
3,not as good as hoped it to be,"the book is good but for computer beginners without even knowing how to use Windows. the author asumes every thing will go find & don't give any extra tips for troubleshooting. he din't even explain how to get the sound cards,printers and some other basic hardware working.does he think every one knows how to do it?i have a sound blaster and a HP printer and i can't get it working. does anyone think a person will choose an O/S that he can't get things working in his PC???"
2,Information for beginners only,"If you know nothing about Linux, little about computers and want info on the caldera distribution then this book is an okay starter. But it will not give you enough details to be the source you rely on when running/installing Linux. Not quite three months after purchasing, my copy of the Idiot's Guide looks brand new while my O'Reilly Linux books are painfully dog-eared."
2,"When they say Beginner, they REALLY mean beginner....","I bought this book because I know absolutely nothing about linux, but I do know about computers - and that's where I was dissapointed. If you are new to computers and you want to get on the Linux bandwagon then this is the book for you. But, If you know what a window, a button, and a toolbar is look somewhere else. It's doesn't seem like a bad book, but I definately needed some more meat to read. I'm returning it and buying an O'Reilly book."
2,Ball didn't last a day...they still enjoy the tail,"My aggressive chewer, who never met a stuffed toy he won't ingest, tore through the ball in an hour. I had to cut it off the tail so he wouldn't swallow pieces. He got the squeaker out in two days, but still likes playing with the tail. Not the worst product we've tried but definitely not the best."
2,Didn't hold interest long enough,"For some reason, my maltese was very interested in it at the store and then for a few days. But after that, it was quickly forgotten. Its a good idea because the tennis ball would make the tail bounce around. Not enough appendages for my dog to like this, however."
4,Mallory's leaving. What will Jessi say?,"When Mallory decides she's going to go to Redfeild Hall, a boarding school up in Massachussetts, she doesn't realize the impact it'll have on her family and friends. When she goes to Mary Anne for advice, Jessi gets angry that Mallory didn't come to her. Can Mary Anne figure out how to bring these two back together, before Mallory leaves for good?"
5,The best REALISTIC BSC book,Mallory is having a hard time at SMS so she goes on the net and search for schools she could enroll in snd she's been accepted. But Jessi's mad that Mallory told Mary Anne first rather than her To tell you the truth this BSC book wasn't really what I expected. I expected Mallory to change her mind like any old book but she''s leaving I'll miss her like the BSC
1,"Sorry, but I'd pass","I rarely give up on a book. Deleted this one about 1/3 of the way in. I couldn't stand the female character. I get she had a horribly traumatic childhood. But she freaks out about every noise and shadow, and basically is just super annoying. I didn't care about her or what happened to her. The plot's pretty lame and boring as well. Don't bother."
1,they have the wrong saying listed,The inscription is that of a mother's day plate not the saying listed--if you're looking for a gift for your mother it's ok but inappropriate for anyone else
3,Good product just not as pictured,"It works fine it is just not as pictured, in the picture is shows a single hole plate with one connector. It comes with a two hole plate and you only get one connector so now I have an open hole in the box. I only needed one connector for my sub that is why I ordered this one."
4,Lectio Divina Reflections,"This English translation of the original written by Pope John Paul II's preacher to the papal household contains five Lectio Divina reflections on passages from the Letter to the Ephesians. This first four reflections were delivered to the Papal household. Of the most interest to me was the final reflection on the topic of the family as ""domestic church"" with focus on the relationship between spouses and between parents and children."
5,Beautiful Model Water Tower,"This is so nice I ended up putting it on a layout for my grandson, and I had bought it for my layout! Then I bought another one to replace it on my layout.Beautiful detail, looks just like the one I am representing on my layout from my hometown. Exact in all details, very fine detail in fact.Even though the review wants info on a toy, this is not a toy, and very fragile. It is for a model layout, and works perfect."
1,You mean the Worst of Steeleye Span,"I have been a die hard Steeleye Span fan for years. This is the only album of theirs I have ever heard that I did not want to play again. It is an incredible collection of poorly written and poorly performed songs. They are unmistakeably Steeleye Span songs, but most are notably unmemorable."
2,Small Size Ruins Book,The publishers have ruined this book by making it in a small format instead of maintaining the size used for the previous books in this series. I didn't realize that they had changed the size or I probably would not have ordered the book. The content is OK but not the size.
3,african drumming,This DVD presents authentic African drumming from a master and as such is invaluable. I thought it is aimed more at beginners but there are plenty of tips for more advanced players. Baba is thorough in his explanations and demonstrations of basic strokes although a little slow moving. All lessons are demonstrated by excellent performances with his trio 'drums of passion' and this is what makes this a valuable acquisition although I wish more of the material was aimed towards advanced players and the performances were a bit longer. An excellent DVD for beginners.
3,Drum Roll Please.....,"Although this is nicely done, the DVD moves very very slow. Perfect for a beginner, but a little bit slow for someone who has just a little bit of experience."
1,Nothing beyond the basic strokes,"Save your money - don't buy this DVD. The presenter talks excruciatingly slow and does not get beyond the basic strokes, i.e. bass (""gun"" according to the presenter), tone (go/do...right and left tone), and slap (pa/ta...right and left slaps). There are better DVDs out there (like the one by Steve Leicach (sp?), which actually gets into a few West African rythms)."
1,Save Your Money,"This such poor quality - it is not worth the price. It is completely transparent and the drawsting is a pain to use. It takes at least a minute to get it untied to use the bathroom and then to re-tie. More so, evey time you tie it you have to fix the pants as it tends to bunch together with the draw-strings. Save your money - this is not worth even $5"
3,"A nice-looking, readable book","I found the above negative review of this book far more disturbing than anything about the book itself.What's the writer's problem with ""ghostwriting""? It's no secret. It's not as if David Pietrusza (the co-author) isn't listed. It's obviously a book of pictures with comments from Ted, edited into decent copy by Pietrusza. That's what a co-author on a celebrity book does.It's very much Ted Williams in the comments -- maybe even to an uncomfortable extent. He rambles on about the press, about politics, and about hunting and fishing, and none of his views are what could even be possibly construed as ""politically correct."" But I find it interesting that after all this time, he's still his own man -- frustrating and inspiring at the same time.The photos are largely terrific. The layout is good. The text is interesting. And it's the best photo book on Ted Williams out there. That sounds like a recommendation to me."
2,Disappointing and distasteful,"For one, this is a picture book with captions allegedly written by Ted Williams but certainly ghostwritten. Two, although there are a few new Williams photos that appear to come from his own private collection, Williams himself has stated that he lost almost everything of this nature in a hurricane years ago - most of the photos in this book have appeared in one or more of the illustrated Williams books that have already appeared. Three, the reprint quality of many of the pictures is sub-par; better versions appear in other books. Four, given Williams' recent debilitating illness, there is something a little weird about bringing out a book like this at this time. That being said, if you absolutely have to have everything that has Ted Williams' name on it, get this book,but only if you already have everything else. Otherwise, start your collection elsewhere."
5,Unknown Chaplin Series,"These documentaries are superbly well organized and presented. All of the work I have seen by Kevin Brownlow and David Gill, including this one, has been top quality. The Unknown Chaplin set gives a behind the scenes glance at Chaplin and his working methods. It includes alot of rare footage, some of it never before seen in public. James Mason does an excellent job narrating with his clipped British accent, and the music is well chosen and well-fitted to the sequences shown.On another note, I did not think the introductory speech given by Geraldine Chaplin (Charlie's daughter) was of any benefit.And I would warn customers that the copy I received was made from an original which was in bad condition (I refer to volume 1, ""My Happiest Years""). There were many sequences with scratches and little blank sections..."
5,Loved it!,"I haven't seen this series in years & there is no one like Kevin Brownlow & his partner, the late David Gill. Highly recommend this documentary. The added features are revealing & entertaining. The only complaint is there is no introduction by Geraldine Chaplin. I don't really care too much,but the box says it is included...hmmm."
3,Super-Cute but runs small!!!!,"I was impressed with the costume altogether...bright colors, easy to put on, nice brocade details, etc. The only issue I have is that this ""standard"" adult size is tiny. The shorts were micro-length and I had to wear a pair of exercise shorts under the costume to keep from being obscene. The top fit great, not too tight. Everyone commented on the costume at the event, definitely thinking about using it on Halloween, after a few alterations;-)"
2,Not much,The presenter lacks on public speaking skills and the workshop could be delivered with a booklet on scales and a CD. I didn't get much out of it as I did with some famous Hal Leonard's series. You can save your money and get a live instructor for a couple of hours who teaches you the same.
2,"Uh, No....","This seems to be the general sentiment about this game and its true: It has all the problems that the first version has.You get more ship hulls to work with, that is true, but that's about it. The game still has the same lame missions that take forever to play and ARE NOT FUN! Also, the user interface is still pretty much the same.The developers needed to make some major changes in this version, such as being able to captain the ship you built (even in a limited ""Star Fleet Academy"" manner) and to unlock better hulls and equipment other than using the ""credit"" system. How about promotions to higher engineering positions? That makes more sense. I downloaded a money cheat so I could mess with different hulls without playing all those tedious missions. This extended the game's life on my PC by a week but I still got frustrated by not being able to fully interact with my creations.I though that was the whole point behind this game."
1,worst ever,"this game is my #100 game I've ever played... out of 100! This game is HORRIBLE. Don't waste your money on this as it takes forever to play the mission, and i haven't used it for months. i'd recommend starfleet command if you are looking for the next step up. notice the prices... $0.01??? tells you it is cheap. i do not like it. all you do is change the ship around, add crew, and then wait for 30 minutes and finally it sometimes will blow your ship up, and you can't use it again.playit9"
3,"Great Concept bad ""Game""","This game is a must have for someone who is interested in the inner workings of star trek starships. The mission part of the game is really pathetic. The missions are really boring and become repetitive after a while. If one could design the ship, plug in the parts, and then play with the ships kinda like in Klingon academy it would be awsome. Importing your own ship designs into Klingon academy would make it fun to shoot up different kinds of ships. Being able to customize your ship would be a big plus in most star trek flight simms. With the help of this game it could come true."
1,The most boring game I have ever purchased.,"This game came bundled with Deep Space Nine: Dominion Wars, so I should not have expected much. I had purchased the original Starship Creator, and I was very disappointed with it also. I had hoped that the game was going to be improved over the original. Unfortunatly, this is not the case. You have no ability to control the missions once they are started, so basically you must sit back and wait and wait and wait. Eventually you will grow weary of the empty unsatisfying feeling in your gut and turn the game off. By far the worse game I have ever played. Please don't get your hopes up like I did and play this ""game""."
1,Warp 2,"This is a terrible game, has potential but the gameplay was awful, slow and lagging even with a new G4 I was impressed at how poorly it performed. It seemed like a novel idea but it just could'nt pull through. Maybe if it didn't freeze all the time I would be patient enough to sit through the constant lagging...."
1,BOOOOOR-ing.,"How bad is it? Where do I even START! Low resolution, 2D graphics, and cheezy sound effects lead into ZERO interactivity on ""game play."" Spend an eternity simply watching your tiny, 2D ship, and reading Star Trek cliche's in text format. No improvement from the original, with no documentation---their Website's even offline! At best, a tiny (50% of my screen) screensaver, for fans of Next Generation's computer interfaces only. Don't waste your time."
1,Is this the worst game ever?,"Starship Creator must be the worst game ever to be written. The missions are fully automated, not allowing the user to have any control, and even in Accelerated mode, the missions take five to seven real minutes to complete. The crew choice is stupid, too. How are you supposed to recruit crew to your ship, in the Alpha Quadrant, from a ship that is stranded in the Delta Quadrant! Do not buy this game. You will be very unhappy once you install/play it."
3,"Expansion, but not worth it",I was excited about the STSC and got it as soon as it came out. That was a dumb purchase. You get to play adventures but all you do is click and you can walk away for a few minutes. There is no real adventure. STSC Warp 2 is the exact same thing. With the exception of a few ships. Don't waste your time.
4,My Reveiw of Star Trek Creator Warp 2,"Star trek Creator Warp 2 is a very cool game. There are many cool features in it. Such as how you can design your own starship and test it in a mission. Most of the time the ships look like the ones on tv, but sometimes the ships look like they where made in the 50s. All together star trek creator warp 2 is a well made game and I belive you should buy it."
1,Horrible,This game is horrible i mean it is cool to make your own ship but there are only so many classes you can choose from.I also dont like that you cant even drive your on ship the computer just takes it on its own mision.the missions stink because they take so long i spent 45 min on i mission waiting the the game 2 finish the mission with my shipWaist of your $$$$$$$
1,"interested, but not in gameplay","Here, I am trying to find a good build your own starship from the star trek universe. And what is there? Build your own ship and take it out and get blown up. There are plenty of software out there for that. I want a software that lets me build different star trek ships (LOTS of them, not just 7,8,9, or 10). Is there such a software? I hope someone makes one. Put it in an external hard drive, Heck i'D buy it!"
2,Warp 2 Fails to Meet Expectations,"For those of us used to the high-tech graphics of Blizzard Games or those of us who are die-hard Trek fans, Starship Creator Warp 2 leaves us wanting for more. True, it's pretty cool to customize your own starship and then run it on various missions to ""take it for a spin"", but the starship choices leave much to be desired. What about the Miranda, Orbeth, Nova, or Nebula Class starships, or any interesting Klingon ships? The strategy guide is a POSTER that only tells you the very basics in Starship and Mission creation and the website is completely useless. So unless you plan on using this program to augment your Dominion Wars game, I would not recomend it to anyone."
1,Realy dumb no fun at all,"There is no way this game could be fun at all. All you can do is select a ship ,you can't even build your own you have to choose A preselected class, choose your crew ,you can read there bio but it most often won't help you choose, then you install parts ,you cant even place the parts in your ship they just appear there and the part discription isn't helpfull at all, then select A misson and just watch an icon travel over A 1D map of space in real time with an occasional mini movie. Very boring Don't waste your money."
1,NOT for the tech-minded Trek fan!!,"... Luckily, the day before the game arrived to my house, a friend showed his copy to me, and I was shocked. I dare say I've not seen a worse game--ever. One does not create a ship; one selects different variations to existing models. Indeed, the variations are poor AND the same for each ship model, and all of them are a snooze-fest. I had hoped to create a ship might take hours, if not days; instead, it takes five minutes to scan through the steps. Avoid this game at all costs--even if it is free!"
1,Doesnt Work,"I've had this game sitting around for awhile and finally stumbled on it out in my garage, threw it in my laptop and installed. After fittling with it for about an hour I put it back in its box and put it back in the garage. I dont know about the game play since it continually told me it needed me to insert a CD that was already in my DVD Drive. But thats what I get for trying to install somthing with a $6 sticker on the box and is meant for Win98 and minimum system Requirements is ruffly 10 times slower then my computer."
3,StarTrek:Starship Creator Warp 2,"This CD-ROM game plays just like the two(2) before it, the same classes of ships, ect... except for the B'ERL class, the same parts classes, officers ect...,The best thing I like about Warp 2 is that if you have the first and second Starship Creator you can update Star Trek:Starship Ceator Warp 2 by adding the other disk plattform to the game and save disk drive space.A+ if you meed the space."
2,Why can't ship creator be better,"Why can't the starship creator give you the ability to design, construct, install systems, and then allows you to test eash system in a 3D walkthrough type senery. Let you walkthrough the ship and go to the bridge for the test flights and yoyu command the ship from there. You will be able to fix any problems that comes up just like the real engineers do on Star Trek."
2,interesting enough to play for a little bit. not really that fun.,"It's been quite a while since i played this game, but being a star trek geek, it was decently entertaining for a bit - 27 minutes or so. I did like ""designing"" my starship, although it was more like ""pick between 3-5 options"", and then send your ship out on a text-based adventure that had little entertainment value.it's not the game you hope it is, but if you're a big fan of star trek, you'll get a few moments out of it. small ones, but they're there."
5,Headband for my KSC75,"There is only one purpose why I purchased this--for my KSC75. Sure, the KSC75 is clip-on and works just fine using it, but taking them off those clips and snapping on the headband from these headphones makes the KSC75 one step more comfortable. The sound also changes a bit because the drivers are now pressed onto the ear.If we're talking about the stock drivers of these headphones, well, let's say they're worth as much as a pack of gum, and are only worth using if they're the last pair of transducers on the planet, and your life depended on it. Really."
5,Value for money,"Like many, I got these specially for use with Koss's KSC75 stereophones. Snapping on and off the drivers is easy (No modifications needed) and the fit of the headband suits me. My KSC75 now have a headband and is more comfortable.For $2, you get the headphones, adapter and extra foam pads. It is very good value for money. Don't expect any quality sound or construction. Its only $2!"
4,"Good performance, but..",I thing so that the performance its OK but the music was down of my expectative about paganinis'works. Thankyou.
5,Edwards and Bramante rock the house!!,Excellent way to get started on the Contivity/VPN router line. These guys jam!
2,"Ehhhhh, fun for a day....","Well, I was really excited to get the game. I popped it in, started to play, and it was lot's of fun, or so it seemed. Basically, it's the same over and over again. I thought people sit at the bar and you keep servin em, and they get rowdy and you kick em out... nope, they come, you read in the guide how to make the drink and they go ""ohhh"" or ""great"" and leave. Like I said, fun, but I spent 20 bucks and only played once. FUN FOR A DAY!!!"
2,repition repition repition,"It seemed like a novel concept, but now I know why a bartending job would be boring if you only had the same 10 customers all night every night. The charactors in this game are very weak. Sure you make them different drinks, but they say the same thing all the time. It can be challenging to keep up the pace, but I found it more challenging to keep awake."
2,Last Call ?? Save your money,"The main plot of the game is pretty fun, but the graphics are very choppy and cartoon like. There are 7 levels to master and each gets more annoying than the last. On level 4 you will have a customer order a drink from you and as soon as you put the glass down that you are going to pour the drink in they are complaining about how long it takes for you to serve them. After two customers it gets very annoying.P.S. If you need help mixing different drinks this game is perfect. If not save your money."
5,Good product,Very useful. I have a tonneau on my truck and before this could not load small items because they would move out of reach.
2,Works,This did not have the tabs to hold right into the manifold. I got it to go but I am a little worried about it blowing out. For how cheap these are buy them with the tabs to hold onto the intake manifold. Trust me its worth it
5,insightful and interesting,"This look at JFK's early years is very amazing. I loved the idea of exploring his early years in depth. As a school teacher, I realized that so many of the students we see as average students or pranksters have great potential! The book shows JFK's relationship with his older brother as being very strained. I didn't realize they were so competitive, but this book points out how competitive they really were. I loved this book! If you are a fan of the Kennedys and are looking for a glimpse into the young life of JFK, this book is the one."
4,Aiptek 2000s,Nice little videophone. Th quality is not the greatest but I never expected to be. I'm happy with it so far I might buy more who knows. I recommend it if your not looking for perfection if you are look elsewhere.
1,My Wedding Music,"After listening to this CD we were disappointed in the limited number of songs on it. I should have paid more attention before I bought it of course, however I was expecting a little more and got a whole lot less"
5,Best J-Rock Ballad Ever,"I've been listening GLAY ever since 1998, and this album is the best ballad album by far, and probability one of my all time favourite J-Rock album. Strongly recommend ""May Fair"", ""Pure Soul"", and ""I'm in Love""."
4,Re: Gift flashlights,"These small, compact gift flashlights are fine stocking stuffers for the holidays and, so far, work without any issues. The delivery was prompt and there were no problems with the items condition during the shipment process."
3,It's ok,"I bought this light for my keychain, as my Photon Rex Rechargeable pooped out after 6 months. I wanted something more reliable, Maglite is very reliable and extremely compact, but unfortunately not very bright. AAA battery is a major convenience."
3,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this rack about 2 to 3 weeks ago, from amazon, shipping was $25, so $75 total. Assembly is not fun. I used some wood clamps and my own glue (they don't supply enough glue to do the job). The shelves are only 3"" deep, which leave 2"" of the cd hanging over the side. The cds would easily fall out with the shelf until I nailed the shelves in place. So to get this product to work decently you have to modify it a bit. At least it looks nice and is the cheapest revolving rack that holds 500 cds. If I could do it again I would probbaly buy something a little nicer or would have made my own. But this will do for now."
5,Very Practical,I purchased this case to have some protection for my camera. It works very well. I already bought the chain for it and I just close the case with the chain coming out on both sides so that I can have my camera around my neck while it's inside of the case. It works great!
1,Save Your Money,I was very disapointed in this CD.For the price I expected more. After reading about it I thought the songs were going to have words that said something about the wedding or the bride and groom and they didn't. The singers are OK but for some of the songs I could hardley hear what they were saying.I did finally find another CD (on Amazon) I really like.Its called The Ultimate Collection Of Wedding MusicThe price is great. I got 3 CDs for less than I paid for this one. There are more songs and a much better selection of music on this CD and the singers are very good.Bride in Chicagoland
5,BEAUTIFUL!!,"I bought this CD specifically for the Mother/Son dance at my son's wedding. The song I chose was ""The Man You've Become"". This song truly spoke to my heart about my love for my son and how much I admire the man he's become. A wonderful choice for our special dance. The songs on the CD are all unique - not ones you've heard over and over. Aa truly beautiful CD!!"
1,"Bland, Corny, Generic","I bought this at the request of a family member for an event, and I really wish I hadn't. The songs are bland and generic with lyrics lacking any insight. It's essentially greeting card rhymes sung over uninteresting and very likely synthesized ballad music. This is more appropriate for the $2.99 bin -- way overpriced trying to capitalize on wedding sentimentality."
2,Over priced,"This CD has a few good songs, but is way over priced. Sadly, it seems to be the only way to buy some of these songs."
1,meh...,I will not be using any of the music from this CD in my wedding. After listening to the songs a few times I decided that they are just too generic and I dont like them. I think the CD was extremely overpriced also.
5,GREAT MUSIC FOR EVERY SPECIAL OCCASION,"Our son recently got married and the Mother and Son dance was entitled ""The Man You've Become"" which was a beautiful renditionof what a son is when he grows up and marries. I was very proud to dance with him to this beautiful song. They are other songs on the album too which are great for daughters and anniversaries, etc. I was very pleased with our choice."
3,A picture summary of the Russian Revolution.,"I think the author does a good job of detailing the reasons why the Russian autocracy was overthrown in 1917. He starts with the Decembrist Revolt in 1825. Then he details the results of four foreign wars and how they weakened the Russian monarchy. The last one-World War one-kicked the props out and caused the government to implode. A weak provisional government followed, and ultimately the Bolsheviks managed to tear down this structure. All power now accrued to the Soviets and the Bolsheviks with the help of the Left SRs seized power. A dictatorship of the people now ensued.This is a nice photo book of this historic event. The author does a very credible job of explaining why this Revolution took place."
3,"Dedicated fan, but ....","In an effort to be more modern the opening sequence tries too hard. The music is so glaring I push the mute button on and the visual effects more resemble the Outer Limits. Also although I think Forrest Whitaker is a fine actor (and in this case producer) he seems miscast. In the 80's version you only had a narrator and this series would have done well to follow suit-no one can take Rod Serling's place. As for the episodes themselves, some are pretty good and others so-so. Being a fan I still bought the set knowing all of the aforementioned from watching some of the shows when they first aired. This may well be the last attempt to revive this otherwise outstanding series which is likely the most beloved sci-fi gem. Maybe we'll all luck out and an unlikely network like AMC will take it on in the same quality format as they did w/ their hit show Mad Men."
3,"Good for a single viewing, entertaining, just didn't grab me","We picked this up at a local retail store for $29, so even if it's the ""weakest"" of the TZ series, I figured for about 75 cents per episode we can't go wrong. There are some gems in here, but far more stinkers. Overall, I think at the end of each episode, it was more of a groaner than an epiphany--which is what the 60's and 80's episodes often left me with. What makes this show is that the episodes are only 20 mins long each, so you can move along at a fast clip. IT's like reading a sci-fi collection of short stories! They aren't all bad, but on average, you won't get that ""whoa"" experience. I agree, Forest Whitaker was woefully cast. He's a cool guy, and has a place in many parts, but as the host of this show, he just doesn't fit in...he doesn't add to the mystery at the beginning of each episode, but just sort of glaringly stands out (and, sorry Forest, but the ""bouncer"" look just isn't appropriate for a sci-fi story)."
1,The One star says it all,"This is the shortest review I have ever given for a show to date.This version of the TZ puts the original classic masterpiece to shame by using its name. If you are interested in newer TZ stories, try the 1980s version. This set is a klinker that has no right to even refer to Rod Serling."
3,"As usual, the truth is *somewhere* in the middle","Firstly, so far I give this 3.5 stars.I'm in my 30's and adore the original. Nothing can touch it, that's a fact. But many here seem to forget the original, which ran for 5 years, had its share of clunkers. Particularly, some of the hour long shows. ""By default"" many seem to give ""any other show"" in this vein a D+. And to me that isn't right. Sure, it's easy to jump to your allegiances, but it's far from fair.This show like any other has its strengths and weaknesses; I could have lived without the harsh ""Korn"" theme, I like Forrest Whitaker, and of course adore the music of Mark Snow. The casting seems much better than expected, but then again some of the stories seem like sci-fi-by-the-numbers.In the end, if you think you are going to find a better way to spend $15; 6 discs & 43 episodes, you better get a reality check... hell, a movie ticket and popcorn is $15, and you still won't have enough for a soda."
1,not a single good one,"I have been a fan of anthology sci-fi/horror shows since I was a child. I watched Twilight Zone reruns, saw the first ""new"" Twilight Zone series, watched Tales from the Darkside, Ray Bradbury Theater, Monsters, Amazing Stories and more. the point is I've seen em all, even the ones that were canceled quickly. alot of them were really bad, but even the worst of em could hang their hats on one thing: they all had at least one episode that was really amazing, and really freaked you out. this was the first sci-fi/horror anthology I've ever seen that didn't even have that!"
5,Great,I don't know why this season only ran for one season. I thought this was a very good deal awesome episodes at a great price.
2,Way too many misses,"I have to agree whole heartedly with the amazon review here. There's only about one decent episode on each disc, the rest are either too predictable or just silly. My highlights: ""Memphis"", ""It's Still a Wonderful Life"" and ""Evergreen"" Like I said, I agree with amazon totally. Still it's good on a boring day if theres nothing else on"
4,Good to watch & buy,"I bought it for approximately USD 28.00 & it has 43 episodes. Excellent & cheap for modernized version. The only part that I hate is that the captioning doesn't appear although the info on product details does mention about it. Is there anybody out there able to see the captioning on DVD player? I pity on my eldest impaired-hearing uncle; he can only watch it with the subtitle without the captioning. Anyway, it's a good purchase. Thank you very much Amazon for making it cheap (even the New Line Cinema own online retailer is selling it around USD 59.00!!)."
4,DVD Presentation Review,"My only problem with the DVD set is that the episodes are not on the 6 discs in the order in which they originally aired on UPN. Granted, ""The Twilight Zone"" was an anthology show, with no episode-to-episode continuity. And maybe the episodes are on the discs in production order. But I'd rather have the episodes on the discs in the airdate order."
3,Not tat ad of a bargain,"I got a used copy for $10. It's a bargain. i am almost thru dsk one and believe it's better than some give it credit for. But it's far from perfect. I respect Forest whitaker but he is the biggest weakenss! He doesn't 'sell' the Twilight Zone. Some of his deliveries ar like he's practicing. I alsways like antholgy shows. Hardly anybody ca ike every eisde of an anthogy. But veriety is the game. Since the shows are about 20 minutes long, a lame episode is not that unbearable. It's not as good as the original, but that has some klinkers and redundant stories too. Maybe the next Twilight Zone incarnation will be better, but I am kinda enjoying this."
5,Super love it,I love all TZone. I saw this one the other day and the price was just right. Quality is awesome and I even found some I hadn't watched. I can watch TZone over and over. I have quite few favs. If your a TZ lover then get this in your collection.
3,OK. Not Great.,"This was the last and worst of the 2 prior series. The only reason I bought it was to see if it was really as bad as other people said it was, andthe price was low. Some of the episodes were so bad that I fast forwarded it on to the next. If, you are a avid fan of this show I'm sure you willalso want to see it."
2,Collectors Item...Grab it !,"I did not really care that much for this new updated version of the TZ, but for 43 episodes and Amazon selling it now for ONLY $14.99 i'm sure this set HAS stopped being made and as time goes on it will be harder and harder for people to find and will become a collectors item!!"
1,Run away!!,"It took forever and a day to get this item. Almost two weeks. When I finally got it and pluged it in, it did not work (indicator light was off). Tried it on the boat and two car lighter and still did not work. Fuse was OK. Now I get the pleasuse of dusting off my voltmeter and troubleshooting this thing. Maybe having to disect it too oooooh goodie."
1,falls apart inside,Used it once on my motorcycle. The little coil inside is not securely fastened and broke off. The original equipment coil has a spot of stuff to keep the coil from vibrating and breaking off. This adapter is junk
4,Etrex GPS adapter,Works well but is somewhat difficult to plug into the GPS slot. Seems like too tight a fit for this generic product.
1,NOT GARMIN VISTA COMPATIBLE,This product claims to be Garmin Vista compatible -- IT IS NOT! -- I had to send additional shipping $$ in order to obtain the correct item for Garmin Vista.
2,Dissapointed,"I Bought the one disk version as it's said, but ended up being the 3 disk version =/ I paid the extra amount for the one disk as well. I enjoyed the Series but as said, wasn't expecting to have to swap out cd's constantly"
3,My kids love it,This is a good kid friendly video based on characters from the old video games. My two boys aged 7 and 10 love it and have watched it many times.
2,I'm a big fan of Mega Man,The show is cute and all. I think it could have been better. The animation was superb but that couldn't save the show. It seems as though the people who made this show didn't care when it came to series and character development. I like the character(Robots)designs though. Oooooh the purists are gonna eat me alive for that. The voice actors were pretty good. I think the animators and screenwriters didn't care a lick. No wonder this show bombed. I hope I become a famous animation director I would have done a much better job.
2,The only Megaman series where Megs is a real character!,"Unlike the new Megaman-NT Warrior series, this original syndicated cartoon from the 90s(which also played a little on ABC Family)is NOT anime. This was an original North American production that was dubbed in Canada. In it, Megaman is named Rock and created by a friendly scientist, along with his domestic sister Roll and his flying robopooch. But, the evil Dr. Wylie along with Megaman's prototype Protoman have their own army of robots they use to try and take over the world. Fortunately, Megaman can take their powers away from them and use them as his own weapons(sorta like Kirby!). This series ran for 26 episodes. At least from not being an anime, at least this series has Megaman as a for-real character and not some gameskin in a VR game."
5,Must have for Megafans!!,"This is the complete first season of one of the greatest cartoons of all time, for me anyways. All Mega Man fans should have this set. Is this cartoon series entirely in sync with the official Mega Man video game storyline? No, among other things Proto Man is still a villain. Put the differences aside and just enjoy the neverending war between Mega Man and Wily. The episodes serve up a ton of robotic action, and appearances by all your favorite Wily robots.(Look out for Season 2 to get the ""Mega X"" episode which is awesome)"
5,"IT""S BACK",wow i haven't seen megaman for the longest time since i was five. it's really cool to watch. the plot is really great ( the new megman.exe actully copied this plot). the graphics are good it's not the old show graphic (like scooby doo or whatever). I think the voice actor of megaman is the voice actor of Goku in dragonballz. It's great for this show to be back.
2,Maybe 2.5 Stars for Fond Memories,"I love Mega Man, and I loved this show when it first aired in 1994. And I was stoked when I first got my hands on this 3-disc DVD set. However, that elation didn't last all that long.What it boils down to is that it's kids' stuff, and I'm not a kid anymore. And I wince when I hear the heroes spouting off cliche one-liners so frequently that James Bond himself wouldn't be able to stomach it.On the other hand, the cool factor remains--seeing the robot masters that I loved so much in my youth on the tube still remains a treat. For that reason, I don't regret owning this set. And I don't think any Mega Man fan would. But nevertheless, before you buy, just remember that my disposition is sentimental, and has nothing to do with these Mega Man episodes being of high quality...because in all honesty, they really aren't."
3,nice clock,"I paid $20 for this clock and it's worth about $15. The plastic is a little on the ""thin"" side...probably made in China...could have been a little sturdier. The colors are right on though. It's nice for a few years."
3,Hard Road to Probability,"This book starts out with one of those improbable things upon which more than one romance novel has hinged: a mother splits twins at birth, and they wind up on opposite sides of the Civil War. This, however improbable it may seem, is one of the more believable events that take place in this book. Mistaken identity, imposters, infiltration of the enemy army, and general skullduggery are all plot twists as the Civil War churns on.I enjoyed this book a great deal, and only noticed a couple of minor inaccuracies in its depiction of the Civil War. However, the implausibility of the plot was a major detraction, and overall I only partially enjoyed the book."
5,Excellent product,With this product on my car it looks better than ever. I would highly recommend this to anyone who appreciates quality
2,Unimpressed,"I ordered the Cleaner/Protectant and the Klasse Sealer. The Sealer gives a great shine, although I will have to wait and see how well it stands up. However I am not impressed with the cleaner/protectant. It doesn't do much for new or old leather interiors. Your better off to stick with a good leather cleaner that will penetrate the surface. For cleaning other interior surfaces it is a substandard product. I cleaned one car interior with Klasse and one with Turtle Wax Ice ""Total Interior Care"" and the Turtle brand gave much better results.JMHO"
5,Excellent Compilation of Historical Data about the Bass That Started It All,"Being a bass player for over forty years, it was wonderful to look back at the instrument's evolution from a 1950's curiosity to an indespensible element in most of today's music. I started my playing with a Fender (1968 Jazz) and now I have a 2008 P-bass with a lot of other brands in between, but all along, the industry standard has been the Fender bass. This book chronicles the Fender bass' 57 years of history along with most of the major players (Fender or not) in a manner not seen in any other publication. I highly recommend it to anyone who plays or is interested in the bass guitar."
4,SHOULD BE REMASTERED ON BLUE-RAY!!,"I give this 4 stars just because as old as this is compared to his more recent live DVDs it is still my favorite. I loved Wings at the peak of their popularity in the 1970's and if they ever get around to remastering this into Blue-ray for better visual & sound I would then give it a 5 plus star rating ...... ""Come on Paul ..... Please remaster this"" :-)"
3,Good Overview,"I'm not qualified to review a book. However, I did read every page and found the book gave me a good overview of many ruins in the southwest. I would call it more of a ""1 minute quick look"" at the ruins since most articles were short. I'm not sure I could have followed all the (brief) directions to the sites.Overall, buy the book if you want a quick introduction to a site you plan to visit.Mike Honeycutt"
5,Gooseberry Park,"I recommend this book because of the animal characters; a bat, a dog, and a hermit crab were really funny. It changed their lifes after a storm. The book show what one friend can do."
4,Gooseberry Park,I think people should read Gooseberry Park because it is exciting. It was hard to put down.
4,Wonderful Read-Aloud,"I used this in my 3rd grade class as a teacher read-aloud and the students loved it. It had characters that all students could relate to --whether it was the sense of humor and crazy antics of Murray,the bat,the heroic deeds of Kona,the labrador retreiver,the straight talk from Gwendolyn,the hermit crab or the motherly sweetness of Stumpy,the squirrel--all children of various learning abilities could enjoy the story. When Stumpy lost her children in an ice storm that toppled her tree, the children were interested in how she would get back to them. When Murray was caring for the babies in the basement, the students would laugh at the bat's appetite for junk food and television. They were delighted and so was I. A real pleasure to read."
5,The best,"Will this ice ever stop? Will Kona ever get to Stumpy? Gooseberry Park by Cynthia Rylant is about Stumpy a squirrel who is expecting babies. But soon after the babies are born an ice storm hits covering Gooseberry Park. Her best friend, Kona the dog, will risk the treacherous journey to save Stumpy and her babies. But is he too late or is Stumpy still alive.Stumpy is a squirrel who likes to collect things. Stumpy is nice and is not very clean. She also is funny and a little bit of a smart alek. In the book she changes because she starts off as a collecting mother soon to be, at the end she is a mother with a curiosity about Gwendolyn and other Hermit Crabs. I think Stumpy is really cool because she really cares for Kona, Gwendolyn a hermit crab, Murray a bat, and her three babies Top, Bottom, and Sparrow."
5,A Book You can Cuddle up with and read for hours!,"I read this book in 3rd grade for a reader's tournament at my library. I love this book! It is so wonderful! I want to go and read it again, please read this book.. you'll love it!"
5,Strategic is right,"I've read quite a few books on the game of football. Not being a coach, I don't think most people would want to pick this up, but for those who love the game itself will find this an indispensible reference. The book is composed of short articles by college coaches which deal with one small apspect of offence or a certain type of attack at a time. Although the college game is much simpler than the NFL, the insights I've picked up by reading this book have completely changed the way I watch football, be it college, CFL, or NFL. If I move to a different location where I can join a high school coaching team, this book will be soon find the pages being worn out. Absolutely excellent!"
2,I love American Football but this book is too heavy....,"I wanted a book on American football to help me grasp some basic knowledge on offensive and defensive formations and plays. I do understand all the basic rules and do have a grasp on main strategic themes. Well, this books seems to have it all on the offensive side of the game but it's too technical and complex to my taste and understanding of the game. Mind you, I've followed football since 1987.But this book's too heavy for me; trying to grasp it is like a pain in the neck.I guess I should've gone for a ""football for dummies"" kind of book...."
3,"This book is ""okay.""","I think this book has a good message, but I don't think it is something that is of interest to small children. The illustrations are wonderful. In my opinion, this book is more for moms and dads than children."
1,The Best Gifts,"I thought this would be a good buck to read to children about breastfeeding, but there are only two pages about it. I was disappointed. It should not be under the listings of books about breastfeeding."
3,Auto-Flo conversion kit,"Does it's intended job to an extent, it leaves most of the bottle neck rifle cases full of media due to the fact that they are bottom heavy and when draining media they stand upright, this is really not the Auto-Flos fault but maybe a slight change in design could help with this.My main complaint is on the 600 base the drain pan is too tall to fit under the drain outlet, so you must raise the case cleaner or tip the pan under the outlet while holding it, maybe a square throat on the pan would fix this annoyance"
2,I guess it works as expected but kind of a waste if you have a seperator,I bought this because cleaning brass and then dumping the tumbler into the separator is dusty and makes a bit of a mess. How great would it be to just pull a plug on the tumbler and scoop out clean media free brass? Awesome right? Well that is not what happens here. 70% of the media comes out but the brass are still full and have to run thru a separator or dumped out individually by hand. On top of that if you install on a lyman 1200 tumbler you lose capacity. Only benefit I can see is....well if you have to dump into the separator and then the media back into the tumbler their really isn't one.
2,Outdoor temperature malfunction,"I bought this handsome looking clock at Office Max because it has a big readout screen and outdoor temperature remote sensor. The main problem I had was that the remote sensor would stop transmitting the outdoor temperature causing me to have to reset the darned thing every 4 or 5 weeks. This inconvienence would happen continuously, even with new batteries. The sensor problem rendered the clock useless to me so I gave it away."
1,Bad clock,"Pro: large displayCon: will not adjust to correct time zone, temperature sensor continually outI live in AZ and we do not change times here. This clock is only in sync for part of the year. Even when I manually adjust, it will not accept and will revert to Pacific (when day light savings in effect).Temperature sensor worked for 1 month and never returned (despite new battery/relocation). A waste of money."
3,Pretty Good,"This unit so far seems to work just fine. The panel was a lot bigger than I was expecting, which is neither a plus nor minus to me. Forget about the weather forecasting icon. It is totally worthless. When there's not a cloud in the sky, it will show partially or totally overcast. One cloudless evening it showed rain. That might have had something to do with my boiling pasta at the time, but you would think that it would be the OUTDOOR sensor that would control that function. I didn't buy it for that function, fortunately. Haven't had this one long enough to comment on longevity of the outdoor sensor. The last one I had (different brand, Oregon Scientific) had an outdoor sensor that eventually pooped out after about a year."
4,Weather forecast does not work,"Whether there isn't a cloud in the sky or its pouring down rain, the weather forecast never displays anything except partly cloudy. However the display is easy to read and the temperature seems to be accurate. The atomic clock feature works ok, but there is about a 30 second discrepancy between it and my cell phone which is supposed to be updated from my carrier which is also supposed to be very accurate. I wonder which is more correct."
5,Thumbs up,"Thumbs up for this album and one of the few violinists who can actually plays Paganini. The execution is clean, clear, and surprisingly expressive. It is very seldom that the difficulty of this level can be disguised so well. The sound is natural, free of the forcing idiosyncracies often found in modern interpretations; listening to the CD alone, one can hardly imagine the almost-superhuman techniques that Paganini's music takes. So far, this is one of the most nearly perfect albums I've ever heard. I would heartily recommend it to everyone."
5,Good collection of Paganini's short violin pieces,"This disc contains a good collection of Paganini's short violin pieces. It's not easy to find them together in 1 disc. They are very well played and the recording is clear. However, they may be a little heavy for the casual listener as the main emphasis here is violin pyrotechnic."
3,Caribe 1987,"The average review of Caribe is that its terrible. You must put it in a 1987 context. Once you do that its great IMO. Its not for everyone but I love the time period and the style of filming that was done then. The cinematography is really ""Miami Vice"" like. IOW its like a really long 1980's MTV caribbean music video. The graphics, the colors, the locations, etc. all scream EIGHTIES which to me is fine. You can almost see a plane flying from Cali to Miami loaded w/ coke."
3,A good read.,"Generally a good read. However, the very first chapter, a story about a doomed submarine, doesn't belong in this book. It's like the author's editor told him to add a ""Clancy Chapter"""
2,Limited utility toy,"It's big, apparently tough for outdoor play, but for a nearly 3 year old, very limited in what can be done with it. Even as an adult, I found that the crane mechanism was difficult to manipulate and the hook system was impractical to use for anything. Ours came with a bunch of heavy paper construction blocks you put together, intended to use with the crane hook, but they don't fit on it, so they're useless. Plastic tabs are on some of them to insert the hook rail in to, but even that isn't very functional. Crane winding knob is too difficult for small child also. With only 3 big Tonkas available now for kids to play with outside, this is a big disappointment in the set. Only the Mighty Dump Truck is really a good toy for kids, as even the loader has little going for it. Crane is definitely the worst, though. Not the Tonkas of my youth, that's for sure!"
2,diappointed,"i bought this crane for a 5 yrs old boy for xmas, but i think i will return it. there is a knob that you twist that raises and lowers the crane. well it does raise the crane, but does not lower it. there is not enough tension/weight to the hook part for this to work. what i had to do is turn the knob a few times and then pull the crane hook thing out manually, and even this did not work too well. i think a kid could indeed figure out how to do something with this toy, but can't reccomend it."
2,Tonka tough but not functional,"My 3 yr old son likes this only because of its big wheels and because he can put stuff (other toys and small cars) into the bed. Like other reviewers said, the crane doesn't work very well and the piece that is supposed to hold cars or whatever you pick up comes off very easily. He's basically using it like a dump truck...he had wanted a crane though!"
3,"Interesting conducting, problematic sound","I enjoyed this recording very much. However, one must be warned that not all tracks on this CD are of the same quality. The Carnival Overture is taken from a recording of very poor quality. It still amazes me that it was made in 1949. Then 1929 version of the New World Symphony is far superior. It is cleanest sounding selection on this CD. The other tracks are muddy."
5,Martha should be respected!,"I am well aware that not many women/men like Martha Stewart. Her voice is imperialistic and condescending at times, but she should be respected for her abilities. She is an excellentbaker and cook. Her step by step instructions areimportant for todays economy. It is good that we try to create baked goods from scratch instead ofbuying over-priced, over-processed baked goods in the supermarkets."
3,Good for the beginner.,"As a beginner in the realm of baking ( i mostly dabble in alchemy - turning wood into sawdust, gold into goldfish, etc.), this is a pretty helpful video. Of course, if you don't like Martha, you won't be able to get over the ""martha-ness"" of the whole thing. But, it shows you some simple techniques that are the basis of many baked goods. I would have liked more cookies, as well as more tricks of the trade - especially ways to substitute ingredients for slightly lower fat or sugar versions. still, not bad overall and complements some of the recipes in the baking handbook pretty well."
2,dismal returns,"Not great. The strings break at will, and some don't even seem long enough for the guitar. I have been able to use several, but, nearly a minute or two after slipping them on, have suffered immense breakage. I don't know if I'd recommend this to anyone, because of the breakage. I've gone through 7 or 8 strings in one sitting, just trying to get one string on that will sit on and in place and stay on despite playing the A blues in a less than aggressive manner."
2,bad odor and does not stick to underwear,"I was very unhappy with this item. Maybe they should have left some of the perfumes in. I like hypo-allergenic, but I also don't want a material that will make the oder worse. The adhesive used was in effective, so the pad would slide around and sometimes out of my underwear"
4,Makes me feel nostalgic,"I originally found a copy of this book in my grandmother's attic when I was still a child. I went through a heavy space phase at the time, and was very interested in astronomy. Nerdy child me was entertained by the possibility of aliens, and the artwork and information Allen Frank included were really very cool. However, the book was lost from my possession and my memory, and it wasn't until early this year, when I was talking about it with my brother, that we managed to hunt down the name of the author from extensive googling (a whole five minutes worth!) and managed to find a copy. Nerdy adult me still enjoys this book a great deal."
4,Be a SQL God,"If you need to sling some really nasty SQL which you probably shouldn't be writing in the first place, then this book is for you. Celko is the man. As a cover-to-cover read, you will pick up on a lot of new SQL techniques, but in general, this is a ""I know where to look when I need to know that book."" If you know the basics of SQL and want to start your SQL Master training, then start here. Just keep it close by when you need to remember how Celko was able to get ""that"" to work."
3,"Should re-title ""SQL 201""","I would have preffered a book speciffic to 'SMARTIES' as the title suggests, unfortunately those of us who've been writting SQL for a number of years will find this book of little use. A great book if you are new to SQL or have used SQL sparingly.I was looking for a book that would help me write better, more efficient SQL code and performance tune my code, maybe insights into the compilers ...instead, the book in my opinion, is a good introduction to SQL or a refresher on SQL....I found several errors in the book that annoyed me, not typos, but errors in the SQL itself. Maybe I'm too critical, but considering the price we pay for these books, I beleive I deserve more.Mr. Celko is definately the 'guru' when it comes to SQL....but maybe I was expecting too much!"
5,Very Good book,"I bought this book because Henderson ""TSQL for gurus"" mentioned it, actually I bought all Celkos books, they are great and even if you think you can outsmart the book and the writer you wont get far. It takes time to be good in SQL since it is totaly different from standard procedural language. This books shows you lots of things you may ask why the heck do I need this? abd many would say well the SQL I used has this feature and I dont need that Ansi stuff, but the point is the book makes you think SQL and that is what its goal was not compare or choose a particular SQL implementation, I myself am attached to T-SQL so i tried to do things MS way.I recomend it and if you really want to pushed the way you think SQL forward buy some miles buy it..Sure anybody can write a query .....but how many ways can you do it?"
3,"Good stats, not great content","Well, like most fans, I have eagerly awaited the companion. I think the show stats are relatively complete although I have dozens of shows that are not listed or thoroughly incomplete. What there were of the interviews were also good but after spending a couple of hours with the book, I put it down and wondered if I had missed some sections. There's not enough original ""flavor"" to the book. The stats can be found many other places (on-line) so tweaking them in endless ways just doesn't thrill me. The next edition needs more comprehensive shows reviews, and more original content. I'm the type that will buy every Phish item available and am glad to have the companion but I don't think I'll be picking it up all that often."
3,Lots of Stats,"First of all, dont be fooled by the page number(i think it's got close to 1000 pages)because over half of the book consists of stats and setlists, which you can find on the internet. However, the stuff that wasnt statistics was new, including essays on phish, and plenty of show reviews that i hadnt read before. The book is updated through the most recent show, too, which is nice. Instead of all of the raw statistics that we can find elsewhere, i wish they would have included more essays and show reviews, or other stuff. I am predicting that the Pharmer's Almanac volume 6 will be more interesting reading material though, as volume 5 was. Other than that, the book is pretty nice. I'm just glad that someone finally came out with another book. I believe the last one was The Phish Book."
2,YAAAAAAWWWWWNNNN...,"The much hyped Companion is finally out and to be honest it is quite a let down. Forget coffee table material, this goes next to your encyclopedia britanica collection. Sure it's good for reference, but I can find all that stuff on the net. I'm really disappointed in the lack of reviews and multiple reviews for shows. Let's not even start with all of the typos, that is just ridiculous. I couldn't give it one star as it contained new and corrected info. What is the deal with the tape section, that doesn't tell anybody anything, GHI = 3! Why??? I am a die hard Phish fan, but this doesn't really appeal to me at all. Thank god the Pharmer's Almanac is out soon."
3,Where's the artwork?,"It was hyped as being a collection of essays, photos and artwork from the fans. Instead it's chart after chart after chart..... It's good, informative and many thanks to those who put it together - truly a labor of love. However there isn't enough raw material from the fans - hardly any artwork, and I know a ton was contributed. There should also be a section devoted to fan pictures. That is what a coffee table book usually is, this is more like an encylopedia. Any of the fan websites that has pictures are much better. I have high hopes for the sequel, let's let the fans show what they can do next time. A highlight - the history of Carini."
2,I've used better...,"The back support part isn't reinforced or have extra padding like on a Redz pack. The air tank holder in the back will barely fit a metal 45ci tank- forget putting a 68 fiber wrapped tank in the back. The pod slots collapse, as compared to Kingman Spyder's 4 pod belt, which is better frankly."
4,Well Done,"It reminded me of movies from old. Had a flavor to it as if John Carpenter had directed it, but nicer. Well done Craig Moss (Director)."
3,Geezer action flick,"Bad ass is a fun filled action parody that don't take it self seriously,a little over the top for sure ,but for what you get ,i won't complain, Danny Trejo gives a typical Danny Trejo performance,gruff, ruff and geezer like (grand torino)style of acting in this movie .Ron ""I'll be in every movie"" Perlman make a brief appearance as da mayor ,Charles Dutton plays a sleazy hustler who run the city , There a few tender moments that will not be revealed by me ! there is the battle between Bad-ass and Charles Dutton is worth viewing several times even in slow motion which was hilarious unintentionally,I don't normally even talk about movies like this one , but I actually liked it!"
5,Danny Trejo at his best right here!,"I am a huge fan of danny trejo and loved him in movies like machete and the desperado movies. This is definitely my new best danny trejo movie of all time. I love when he is the main actor and really knows how to keep you entertained. If you don't like violence, then this movie is not for you. The fact that it is based on a true story really makes you connect with the character and what he went through in his life."
1,Not worth your time,"I couldn't watch the whole movie the acting was so bad. Weak story poor acting, not worth the money I spent"
3,Bad Ass,"It was just another 'B' movie. Some good action scenes, very unbelievable story, but A nice way to waste some time."
3,Bad Ass,"This movie is kind of low budget and has really bad dialogue between characters. The ""idea"" of the movie is good and has some entertainment value if you don't mind unrealistic scenes. The ""love"" story part of it is what kills it and I found it to be quite ""cheesy"". Watch it if you have some time to kill (cable out or something) Definately NOT something you would watch twice."
5,"Awesome movie, awesome bluray",This movie is awesome. How many time I wanted to do the things done in this movie. Danny is simply awesome. Bluray is good too.
2,Slow story not much action,Story was slow going and it took a long time before any real action. If you are looking for an action movie look somewhere else.
5,Bad Ass,Absolutely love this movie. I could watch it everyday!!!! Rented the movie and decided I had to add it to my collection. Enjoy watching Danny in SOA and this also.
1,"cartoonish, and also, low-life values","It started out well, but the story became increasingly unrealistic, and the acting digressed as well.The storyline is low-life and definitely not suitable for children, e.g., adulterous romance, glorified punk kid, bad language and gratuitous nudity."
5,Brother and Sister tales,"Hansel and Gretel and Little Brother and Little Sister have always been two of my favorite fairy tales because they tell of siblings working together and succeeding. Consequently, I am happy Barefoot Books has published this new collection of brother and sister tales gathered from around the world. These stories make great bedtime reading to or for siblings. The illustrations are also beautiful and enhance the stories by showing native settings. This would make a great gift to some of your favorite siblings or young children who are just learning how to work together. The strengths and weaknesses of each sibling complement the other sibling, ensuring the success they might not accomplish by themselves. Families are universal and this collection proves it."
4,Good Basic Camera,This a very good basic Camera for Adult beginners. Eats battery's but mostcamera of this type do. Excellent basic camera. Amazon supplier as usual gave excellent service.
2,It has some drawbacks!,"It's an ok camera if you don't compare it with pther camera's but when you do you realize you could get as good for cheaper and better for the same priceHere's why I don't like this camera:The pictures can look a little pixelated at times I'd prefer if it was a bit smootherIt uses alkline batteries which can get expensive since the battery life it not great.It takes too long to warm up to take the shotThe indoor setting gives you alot of light streaks and its really useless and that's no exageration, I almost never use itMy roomate has a 5megapixel canon for less $20 more I always take the photos from her camera to put on facebook instead of from mines cause it would be the same shot but hers just looked better, smoother, cleaner."
1,Don't be fooled by the low price,"While the camera worked, I had very few complaints about it (short battery life, but it took good high quality pix). However, this camera definitely comes with hidden charges. The most expensive and most fragile part in the camera - the LCD screen - is not covered by warranty. In my case, the LCD cracked without being bumped or dropped, (and the clear plastic protective cover didn't crack). This has led to THREE MONTHS of dealing with service centers, paying an additional approximately $150 for parts and labor, and I still haven't received the camera back fixed. It seems the part is in such high demand from people with the same problem that I am still far down on the list for replacement."
4,Mobile and Personal Communication Services and Systems,I need information about of the PCS. This book is Good for my.
5,Good-looking Watch,"This is a lovely, classy watch. Easy to read. Only thing, I bought it 2 weeks ago on Amazon from a different vendor at a price quite a bit lower than offered now. What's up do you supppose?"
3,Just much lighter than what I expected,"I bought this watch from watchsavings at amazon and received this afternoon. Finally found watchsavings is the same company as jomashop. I wound not have bought it if I had knew that since I saw some bad reviews about Jomashop.The watch looks just like the photo, nice and classic. However, it is too light accoring to my standard about good watch or watch over $100. Of course, if this watch is just less than $50, I will not complain. I doubt it is authentic or not.Won't recommend on buying at Jomashop or watchsavings since their watches have no warrenty from manufacturer."
5,Beautiful watch,"Product arrived on time as indicated. My wife loved the gift very much.It's a beautiful, elegant and simple watch."
4,"Great watch, poor band","Wear this every day, it keeps great time, shows the date (a bit small and hard to read) and has a second hand, a plus for me when I'm cooking. My biggest gripe is the clasp. This is hard to manage, often comes open when you least expect it, and the watch just falls off."
3,Nice Boots,"These boots are nice and comfortable. The only problem I have is that I'm not use to wearing high heels,my ankles are bothering me a little. Other than that I like the boots."
3,OK-Not what I expected,"I received this boots the other day and I was a little disappointed. The material does not seem like real leather, not typical of Nine West products. They are comfortable enough to wear to work though."
4,Classy,"This is a great boot, comfortable, classy and great for the office or going out. I would recommend this boot if you are looking for something other then a pump to wear with slacks."
4,Stuart Trier,"Rickertsen presents a comprehensive overview of a management buyout. Before you buy the book, you should know that he is talking about larger companies, and he is talking about fairly senior executives buying them. (One of his examples of a successful buyout manager is Roger Ballou who ran the travel part of American Express.)If you are looking for a company with $5 million in revenues, you may find valuable information here, but you will likely find other books, targeting a smaller company, more appropriate."
5,The Definitive Work in Management Led Buyouts,"Rick Rickertsen's book is an excellent read. His explanations, examples and real life experience provide a powerful tool for today's Executives."
5,A 'real world' business book,This is a book from the real world that business students should read. I found this book tremendously readable. The lessons that Rick has learned are enjoyable and entertaining--while teaching the reader valuable lessons about business and buyouts.
4,Straightforward Guide,This book outlines the phases involved in a management buyout (MBO) primarily from the viewpoint of company management. A more thorough explanation of the financial modeling process would have been useful.
4,A Good Book,"I thought that this book was well written though it did take some times to get into the plot. At certain time I did think that it got a little dull but overall it was well written and quite interesting. If your wondering about the reading level it would be about right for grades 4-7. For forth graders it may be a little difficult and for seventh graders it may be a little easy. Overall, I would recomend this book to most people unless they need action 100% all of the time."
1,This book sure did hit the iceberg,"This was the worst book that I have ever read! It was uneventful and boring. Karolina and Gavin are the usual characters in a Titanic book which made them very original. I do not recommend this book to anyone. I thought that it was badly written as well as a put-to-sleeper. If you enjoy good books, do not read this one."
4,KIDS REALLY GO FOR THIS ONE!,"My 7 year old got this for her birthday. She loved it but the wings were a little flimsy; She didn't mind though and the horse quickly became her favorite. The fairy horse is cute too. Unfortunately, the horse got lost at a friends and she was very upset until we saw it at amazon.com. I purchased it again--and for a great price! For this price, the horse it definately worth it! My 4 year old loves it too!"
3,"More suitable for an ""older"" child...","My 3 year old received this for Christmas, and while she wanted a Barbie horse, this, just didn't live up to her expectations. Although lovely, there are too many pieces (reigns, barettes, saddle, pony, glitter...) for her, and she has some difficulty getting Barbie to sit upright. It has held up well, and I hope her interest will increase as she gets a little older. I would reccommend it for a 5-7 year old. The sparkle from Sprinkles is an unnecessary gimmick for any age child, and just adds to clean-up for Mom and Dad."
4,Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,What a glittery horse. I just don't like the glitter from the little horse. They should make it a baby. And the wings are flimsy. Buit it is sooooooooo glittery and dreamy! I looooove the pink wings and bridl!
2,NOT GOOD BY:ANNE KID 7 1st grade,"Once I looked at the picture of Rainbow and Sprinkles I thought it would be terribly fun. When I got it I didn't let anybody play with it. And the wings didn't fall off very much. After a while I got bored playing with them. Mostly now only my friends play with them. When I used the sprinkles it made a big mess. Rainbow's wings bent, I lost Sprinkles,and I got black spots on the front of Rainbow. I don't think i'l ever play with them. I spent mony for Rainbow horse and Sprinkles just to find out thetI didn't like Rainbow horse and Sprinkles."
3,"A Case Study, Not a Guide","I bought this because I was looking into the possibility of using XP with my team of engineers. While other XP books describe the philosophy and practice of it, this is a ""diary"" of one team's first attempt with XP. It was interesting enough, but their projects and work environment were not sufficiently like ours to make it truly useful. The project in this book is a very small website registration system - not exactly rocket science. If you're already using XP and would like to see how someone else is doing it, then this may be of interest to you. If you are looking for information on getting XP going yourself, look elsewhere."
4,"Fine book to start, but reading needs to be complemented","I have recently finished reading the book and I'm going through it again as I develop my first XP project. I wasn't very familiar with XP before reading it but still I was able to understand the principles of XP complementing the reading with articles from the web.Although they try to justify their decisions and explain their mistakes, I would like it to have more explanations about why they make some decisions and not others. I have found also that some things in their project are a bit ""ideal"" and not as ""real"" as in the projects and organizations I've worked in. For example, their times don't seem to be very realistic as they never spend more time than they planned in their first XP project."
2,Much better books on XP than this one,"This book chronicles the authors' first attempt at using XP (on a three week project). The real gist of the book is to emphasize the importance of test-first programming. However, the authors don't explain how to set it up or give much information on how to use test-first tools. In the end you are given some pointers on doing XP development. Kent Beck's or Ronald Jeffries' books do a much better job of explaining the XP methodology. Get one of those books instead."
2,Not Much Practical Information,"I bought this book mainly because XP theory is everywhere, but examples of applying it to the development process are pretty scarce. I admit I was also persuaded by the authors' reputations.The book is very disappointing. It reads like a Socratic dialogue, only Socrates forgot to show up and left it to two of his freshman students to hash things out. Needless to say, they bumble along and in the meantime do not enlighten the reader much. If you waste your time reading this book, you'll probably realize that you're a more disciplined developer than you thought. To some people that might be worth the [PRICE].For good practical information on XP coding and testing, I highly recommend Rick Hightower's book ""Java Tools for Extreme Programming"". This is a great guide to using open source tools like Ant and JUnit to do XP development in a Java shop. Might be too practical for Socrates to have written, but Aristotle would have loved it."
4,A good over-the-shoulder look at XP,"This is good book if you've already learned the basic theory of eXtreme Programming, and want to see XP in practice from a developer's point of view. You won't learn the theory from this book, but you will watch as pairs of programmers works with their customer to prioritize and estimate stories, and as the pairs proceed through the work, making mistakes as they go, and recovering from them. The focus is on planning, unit testing, and refactoring.The application they've taken on is simple, but non-trivial. It helps to know Java and be familiar with the JUnit testing framework, and have familiarity with servlets. I picked up a couple of useful testing techniques from their examples."
3,"ok, not as bad as some say","On the plus side they discussed an actual project and listed their mistakes and how we could avoid them.But following all the vast coding examples was tedious, esp. if you aren't familiar with Java web programming.For me the book was very short and very over priced for its small content (excluding the source code which makes up a third or more ofr the book).The XP Explained series is decent but there is a lot of overlap and all the books are too short considering thier high price tag."
3,A strange combination; better books are available,"This book combines step-by-step repair and maintenance and troubleshooting sections with chapters on choosing a motorcycle (mainly a series of pictures of different bikes with short comments), choosing riding clothing, accessorizing your bike, and other miscellaneous topics. It's written in an opinionated first-person style. I found it somewhat superficial.For learning how a motorcycle works, I would recommend ""Motorcycle Basics Manual"" published by Haynes; for repair step-by-steps, get the manual for your make of bike; for souping up your bike, ""Sportbike Performance Handbook"" is more informed and explains the why and how behind the conclusions; for riding wear and technique, I'd recommend Hough's ""Proficient Motorcycling."" After reading these, if you just have to read something else, this book is not bad."
2,don't bother with a CD,"While the phrasebook itself is rather useful and well-organised(although while I was living in Japan I found Lonely Planet immensely more suitable), the phrases they use on CD are generally useless.Rather than creating a phrasebook customised for each country, Berlitz decided to make a generic audio-supplement for each language it publishes a phrasebook for, with the same phrases whether it's French, Portuguese or Japanese (they even re-used all English recording from other language CDs ). As a result, you will spend a large amount of time learning how to resolve various hotel and restaurant problems (highly unlikely in Japan), or how to say ""keep the change"" to a taxi driver (insulting and embarassing him in a process), but none -- on how to check in a ryokan, or what to say while visiting a hot spring.I would definitely recommend the phrasebook by itself, but give this particular CD version a pass"
5,Harry Caray would have loved it,"Very funny. Very Cubs. Very Chicago. Very good. I've read Wojciechowski's stuff in ESPN Magazine, but I didn't know he was crazy about baseball. You can tell he knows his stuff. A helluva sports novel."
1,smell... too much,"It has an extremely strong smell - not necessarily pleasant, but overwhelming.I could not use it. Have used other rose water products with much gentler scent."
4,A sweeping Viking Tale,"This book from start to finish had me entranced. I believe this has to do primarily with Cecelia Holland being a truly gifted story teller. No matter where she took the story, I wanted to follow.Corban's growth from a young boy to manhood, is swift as he is faced with the total destruction of his family. His connection with his sister leads him on his journey to save her, where he meets all sorts of people who will become important in his life.The one part I did not enjoy in this book, was the telepathic connection with his sister. This book is rich in historical detail and I feel this detracted from the richness of the story."
3,Weaker than Normal Holland,"Maybe it is just me, but even when I started to get into ""The Soul Thief,"" I was never very into ""The Soul Thief.""It is sad because I generally love Holland's books."
2,So-So,"I love this author, but this book was a big disappointment.Thing's just dragged on and on, I had to read some things twice because it didn't make sense the first time.I didn't realize who the soul thief was until the last minute. I can't explain it, there wasn't enough story about some things-and too much about others.The only thing that would make it up to me would be a sequel to this book written in the way of the Greenlander's or something."
4,not bad but...,"i bought a jar of this about a year ago and i still have most of it. it's not bad but, well, it's really fishy and i just can't get past the unnerving resemblance to fish food. i like lots of other furikake flavors (especially wasabi) but this one just doesn't do it for me. it's alright when eaten very soon after putting it on rice or couscous but the texture/flavor of it after sitting for a few hours is quite unappetizing. i now understand why people buy those little conatiners that let you take a portion to sprinkle on right before eating.maybe i'll try the tea/soup thing charlotte ann hu mentioned. that actually sounds pretty tasty and the flavor of the tea might help cut the fishiness. as for the price and vendor, the price is very reasonable and it arrived fairly quickly and in excellent condition."
4,Really a very nice watch.,"This is a relatively inexpensive watch that has many features that I expected to see on only a much costlier watch. It has a Swiss ETA movement, a sapphire crystal and is water resistant to 50 meters. So far it has been very accurate and it looks very nice to boot. If the band had a double locking clasp it would be just about perfect for me."
2,Not so good,"It is simple to echo the review that the exposition is not very clear and that the book should present more examples. Further, though, I would disagree with the reviewer who comments that the notation is consistent. In short, this book should be read only by those who already have an absolute grasp on the material, because the book is written for them."
1,The book is a Xerox,"Looking from outside, the book seems very good. However, when you open the cover you are shocked by the press quality. It seems like the book just came from an illegal copy shop. Sometimes you can not read small indices in formulas. For a book having this context, a better press quality should be used. I could make a better copy with a copy machine. The paper quality is around average."
5,Glorification of God and municipal pride,"I think, Herreweghe is getting better each time as regards his Bach-recordings. Those who had the impression that his recordings are a little pale, as I did, I would say that is true as for some of his older discs. In his more recent ones, he proves the contrary. The choir sounds fresh and aggressive, but at the same time very organic and smooth. The orchestra is splendid, especially this holds for the four trumpets which fulfil an important role in the glorification-style choirs. The Soloists are excellent, I would say some of the best you may find at the moment in the field of Bach-interpretation. Hopefully, Herreweghe, his ensemble and technical engineers keep going on like this."
2,Rivers of Gold,"While Hugh Thomas's scholarship may be legendary, he lathers his text with stultifying minutia. Barbara Tuchman he is not. As such, the book should be reserved for graduate students wishing to impress their department heads that they can wear hair shirts.Philip Meyer"
3,Great detail for scholars; not for the general reader,"The incredible amount of detail may very well be useful to some readers, so I am loathe to criticize it. I am, however, utterly baffled by the Publisher's Weekly review, which says: ""Indeed, readers free from colonial prejudice will be surprised to find themselves also written out of history: `Who can doubt now,' Thomas asks rhetorically, `that the Spanish were right to denounce the idea of religion based on human sacrifice or the simple worship of the sun or the rain?'"" Are we to assume that those those who are ""free from colonial prejudice"" are in favor of, or at least open to, human sacrifice?"
1,Turgid and Overloaded,"The NY Times review (by the estimable Paul Kennedy) was such a rave that I rushed out and plunked down 35 large for this tome, having so loved Thomas's _The Conquest Of Mexico_. What I got was an occasionally interesting but mostly dull meander through useless minutiae of the early Spanish conquest (all those names!) without a sense of drama, of a story being told or even a point of view. Especially disappointing are Thomas's characterizations of the conquistadors. These courageous and villainous ruffians are among the most interesting figures in history and yet here they come off as inept one dimensional politicos. The final chapter, where one expects an author to pull everything together, is an off-topic historical portrait of Seville. It left me asking, what? This book would have been better at half the length."
2,Lost in the Minutia,"What should be an interesting work about Spain's exploration and conquest of the New World turns into cumbersome and bloated work without focus. I have to agree with another reviewer who asked, ""where is the editor?"" Thomas repeatedly goes off on tangents and fills pages with unimportant information which makes reading the book a chore. It is well researched and footnoted, but Thomas fails to explain why all the facts he dumps into the book are important."
2,"A pity, really","As others have noted, there are striking errors of detail. The botching of the account of Ponce de Leon's trajectory along the east coast of Florida struck me as minor but annoying. Getting the story of the day lost crossing the international date line going west exactly wrong (p. 509), exactly reversing Pigafetta's narrative, is simply unforgivable. It's a pity the book lacked, it would seem, a proper editor."
1,Stick with Morison--The Master on This Subject,"I was not thrilled with this book at all. I enjoy reading books about early explorers, and I guess I expect others to live up to the standards of my favorite author on this subject, Samuel Eliot Morison, the late historian from Harvard University. As others have stated, minor figures are given too much coverage causing me to lose interest. Ferdinand Magellan was given too little coverage for his achievements. If you want to read about Columbus and others from this time period stick with ""The European Discovery of America: The Northern Voyages"" and ""The European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages"" by Morison. They are riveting reading at their best."
2,"Dull, confusing, and disappointing","I held great hopes for this book. I'd long been looking for a well written history of the Spanish conquest of the New World, and was sucked in by the review in the New York Times. Well, this book isn't what I was seeking. In this tome Thomas is riding on his reputation; or better stated perhaps, his reputation seems to have intimidated good editing. The cast of characters is overwhelming, even bewildering; and Thomas' arcane writing style only makes matters worse. There must be something better somewhere."
2,SAT ON SHELF TOO LONG,"THE ITEM,""MONGOOSE"" HAS TUBES THAT WERE CRUSHED ON THE ENDS AND SOME ITEMS INTHE KIT WERE STUCK TOGETHER,BUT I MADE DUE WITH EXTRA PARTS I HAD LAYING AROUND."
1,90 Day Warranty For a Product That Lasts only 90 Days,This enclosure worked well for about three months of very infrequent use. Now it wont power up - even with both cables connected. You would be better off looking for an enclosure with a warranty of more than 90 days that this product provides.
4,The power of Redemption,"M's Harris story is one of God's redemption for us. It was truly a joy to read and see how God's redeming power continued to be with M's Harris for over twelve years, waiting for her to receive her blessings. Very powerful book showing God's great and everlasting power and love. Very encouraging. Must read and send to all your friends, male and females."
5,A courageous act of love,"Patricia Harris is a writer of unusual and spiritual vision. She has the natural ability to put every deed in context with the love of God. Personally, I was moved by the way she made me realize that I too was forgiven. Now, I can move on with my life and experience the joy of God's many blessings. This was a courageous act of love for mankind. Patricia approached a topic that is taboo; because of her courage, we all can identify with either one of the characters, yet walk away feeling good about ourselves and who we are as God's children. Imprisoned by Secrets of the Heart will also benefit men as well as women. If you have any doubt about God's love and forgiveness you must read this book. Many thanks to Patricia Harris for her insight and unselfish act of love."
3,It's reasonable,"It definitely comes with less in it than appears in the picture, but it still has a lot in it anyway. I was previous living in Germany for 2.5 years, and had used Herb De Provence mixed seasoning ALL the time there, so after I returned to the USA I really needed to find it here as well. The taste of this one is decent/alright, and I am not saying that it's a ""false blend""--but it wasn't quite the blend I had hoped for--not quite like what I'd used in Germany. Because of the good price, I will probably still buy this one again if money is an important factor. If it isn't as important, I might try out a different blend."
2,Bottle was NOT as full as pictured here,Bottle was NOT as full as pictured here.It was about 2/3 full.The level was BELOW the bend or break in the neck.
5,another Whitefeather winner!,Nick Bluestone is proud of his Comanche blood. However his twin brother does not embrace their Native American heritage as well. Then his brother is killed but he had asked a vow of Nick to take care of his wife & child....the Comanche way.Elaina & her adolescent daughter travel to Oklahoma to visit with her husband's brother. Her emotions are tender as Nick resembles his brother in looks but she clearly sees that he is very different as he lives & breathes his heritage unlike her husband had. So Elaina is surprised to learn about the request her husband had asked of his brother. That Nick be her husband & father to her daughter.This is another wonderful Native American story from Ms Whitefeather. Tender & touching! I adored the hero......he embraces his family as wholeheartedly as he does his heritage. And the ending was fantastic!!
3,FAIR,IT WAS SLOW.... LET'S JUST SAY I'M GLAD I DID NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS ONE. NOT A STRONG MALE CHARACTER. THIS PREMISE NEEDED A LONGER FORMAT WITH MORE EVERYTHING.
2,Definitely Way Over-Priced,"This case is definitely way over-priced. Very flimsy and not nearly as convenient as the cases we all used to get for our 35mm cameras. This one secures with velcro, not a snap, and it doesn't fit well. Can't flip the cover off the lens to quickly take a shot the way you could with the nicer semi-hard cases.It's fine for offering minimal protection to throw the camera in a backpack without having to take the entire camera bag, and it will keep the dust off your camera when it's sitting around out of the bag, but this is not a high-quality, highly functional item by any means. Very disappointed."
4,Olympus CASE SEMI HARD,Case offers very limited protection but does a great job of keeping the dust off your camera. This case works well for me but then I store the camera and one lens in this case and put them in a large camera case when transporting.
2,E-510 case,Way over priced. This item would be priced at $14.88 if bought at Walmart.Save your money. RFG
4,Love At First Sight.......aaaahhhh,"I loved this book. The characters were believeable. The romance was just the right touch. I usually stay away from something so ""cheesy"" as a love at ""first sight story"" but this book might just change my mind. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the author had just the right touch with the whole step-family issue. It was a beautiful and touching tale that makes me believe that true love is truly possible."
3,It was all right,"Not a bad read for a rainy afternoon, but the first half of the book dragged. Once it developed something akin to a storyline, it improved."
2,Is it me?,"When it works, it works well. But sometimes it does not charge. I don't know if it's my laptop or the battery? I wish I had another to compare."
4,A Great Album!,"Another wonderul recording from Jim McNeely. Check out the quote-fest in ""Rhythm, and."" Incredibly original writing and very well recorded. The band sounds great!"
5,Energetic,"This album has lots of ""south of the border"" rhythm in it. The instrumentals in it are very lively with a great message."
3,What Happened?,"Before I begin, let me say that I've been a fan of Salvador since ""Live in Austin"", their actual first album. Upon hearing that Salvador was going to release another album, I was filled with excitement. I was certain they would step it up on this new album, they are a very talented bunch after all. When the album was released, I dashed to my local music store, picked up a copy, and inserted the disk into my cd player...One thing that has always bothered me is how Christian music has a very ""Christian Sound"" to it. It's very generic. Dismiss the Mystery is an album that falls into that category. Besides two really good tracks, ""Shine"" & ""Te Enaltezco Dios"", and one ok track, ""Now That I Have You"", everything else is generic. Trust me when I say this, I wanted it to be good, but it's time that Christian artists stop taking the ""safe"" route in the music industry, and step it up! I just hope that their next effort will ""shine"" brighter."
5,Nice product,"Very nice product, much better than I expected. Very sturdy, but flexible. I have a small breed dog, and most pet hangers don't work well but I think these hangers will fit any size pet clothing. I have ordered several different types of pet clothing hangers and these are definitely the best I have ever seen. I would definitely buy again, well made product!!"
5,A Dog's Life,Great product! I love spoiling my little Bichon and figured I needed some hangers for all of her clothes! These hangers are wonderful! I would definitely recommend these to anyone with a spoiled pooch!
4,Great for pet clothes,"I bought a set of these for my dog's clothes. They are very handy and keeps his clothes organized. I've already used all of them in the package and might need to buy more! My dog wears XS to S size. So all of his clothes fit perfectly on these hangers. The only down side to them is the hook. The hook is kind of small, so it doesn't fit over a standard closet rod easily. You kind of have to twist them onto the rod. Aside from that, great product!"
2,Disappointed,"McKean should stick to what he knows best: violinmaking! I picked the book up because the cover portrait of Leonardo's Ginerva caught my eye, having recently visited Florence and studied the quattrocento. I enjoyed the author's depiction of life on a Medici villa and the discussions about art. The time travel and the love story are both unsatisfying, however, and McKean never connects the dots at several points--there are major holes in plot development (unconnected to the time travel) that I found confusing and frustrating. At the same time, his descriptions are overwritten and overwrought. I got very tired of the leadups to the ""wolf tone."""
3,Hit and Miss,"Although McKean often does a wonderful job describing the signficance (and binding power) of art through the centuries, the mechanisms by which the protaganist travels between our world and that of the Quattrocento are weakly conceived at best. The reader is often left trying to fill in plot construction gaps that the author should have invested more time in developing. The overall result is a short novel that is at times intriguing, but ultimately unfufilling."
2,Poetic passages do not a novel make,"James McKean is a fine craftsman, as a builder of violins and as a poet. His first novel, ""Quattrocento,"" is larded with exquisite passages. Unfortunately he has not yet learned how to construct a longer work. Only the central character has any depth; everyone else peopling this effort at a work of fantasy is not even a portrait - barely a sketch. Through his protagonist the author exhibits some erudition in the realms of art history, restoration and attribution, and could, perhaps, achieve more novelistic success after studying some of the works in those fields which have enjoyed success in the marketplace. ion, e.g. Jonathan Harr's ""The Lost Painting."" In the meantime the world will be more served by his poetry than by his prose."
2,Not engaging,"Sorry. I liked the idea, but this product did not meet my expectations. It did not engage the users. The interface was 20th century. The technologies used were outdated. My advice is to look elsewhere."
5,sooooo cool!,"I had never heard of this toy before (Nsect). I just happened to be walking through a store the day after Thnaksgiving and there it was. I wasn't really sure what it was, but my 11 year old son had not asked for any toys for chrismas, only practical stuff, so I thought why not. I took it home, wrapped it up and he opened it Christmas day. He charged the batteries right away and as soon as it was ready he was using it. It turns out to by way better than any remote control car we've ever had and it is so much fun that we have since bought 2 more for 2 of his 3 brothers. We love this bug.KB"
4,RC NSECT Creature-1 st grader likes it!,"My 7 year old loves this toy. He played with it over and over for about 5 days. Then he became a littel bored with it. He does like to chase the dogs around with it, and his little 4 year old brother has yet to destroy it. The battery does require some charging every few days.As a parent, my biggest complaint is it is very noisy! It drives us crazy. His grandma about went through the roof on the second day. Also it does better on flat surfaces (tile and wood) than on the carpet. So if your household is a noise free zone and is covered in carpet, I do not recommend it. If your house has loud boys and likes creatures crawling and has flat surfaces, this is a decent toy."
2,Defective Misslie Launcher,"Almost cool. TYCO, Fix the missile firing problem that nearly everyone has, and it would be pretty neat. I don't know how all these defective shooters slipped past the quality control. Tyco obviously did not test this function very thoroughly, or just decided to ship them defective. The movement is nice and worth a couple stars, though."
1,Excellent Quality,"I was a little skeptical before purchasing this item because of some of the reviews. It actually works really well and I am very pleased with it. I did charge it the appropriate 5 hours prior to use and it worked perfect right from the start. It even worked great after being left out side all night in the rain!! I was shocked but very impressed!! Works with generic foam darts, which is a plus. Would highly recommend for anyone ages 6 and over."
3,More Missle Troubles,"Hi - The movement is great, but count mine as another one that was defective out of the box - the missles won't fire. Both my sons get a kick out of it otherwise. Good, but not perfect, thus the 3 star rating."
4,Nephew loved the toy!,"The RC NSECT did exactly what the box said it was going to do. A little noisy to play with indoors but outside, my 5 year old nephew had a blast! The toy shoots the way it said and just as far if not further than promised. It picked up objects as well. The only thing of importance is that my nephew loved it."
1,Broken out of the box,"Even though other reviews indicated problems out of the box, my grandson was hooked and thought he had to have it. We chanced it, and sure enough, our bug was one of the broken-out-of-the-box ones too. It is also as noisy as a tank! Surely something I would be telling him to turn off shortly after he has turned it on. Good idea, just does not perform well."
1,If less than one star were possible...,"This toy is an absolute waste of money and eventually time. The missiles will not fire at all. I even requested the ""black projectiles"" from Tyco/Mattel and guess what they did not work either. Now you ask, ""What will Mattel do about it?"" Not much thus far (maybe if they had someone that actually wanted to help you on the phone). Do yourself a favor, spend your money on something else unless you are really moved by throwing away money."
1,"Great Idea ,Terrible Unfuctional Toy",The toy we received was defected. It was terrible because that was my son's most desirable toy for christmas and now he has to wait 6 weeks for a replacement.
2,To return or not return - that is the question,"Bought for my son for Xmas. Rocket launcher is impressive (mine works) and I agree with the review that this is a complex mechanical toy. I was skeptical. Sure enough the forward movement on the right bank of legs ""GGRRRINDS"" as something is obviously wrong. If I return it...I am afraid that I'll just get another one with something else wrong. To return or not return ....that is the question."
2,Bugger,"Bought this for my son for Christmas. It was the top thing on his list. His best friend received one as well. They thought they could wage war against eachother. My son's rocket launcher broke within 2 weeks. Not from over use. Without the rocket launcher he lost interest. Acutally, he lost interest earlier. After the initial excitement is over there is not much you can do with this toy. Also, it is BIG, takes up storage room and is noisy."
3,BUGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a fun toy. I bought it for my 6 year old. It does quite a few things and keeps him entertained. The downfall is the battery pack doesn't last that long otherwise it's worth buying.
2,It's great when it works,"My 7 year old son was excited when he opened this big box from Santa. As with many other toys though, the excitment was tempered by having to plug the battery pack into the charger before using it. when we finally got it going, it was great, although even I was surprised by the force of the foam missles. The easily flew 20-30 feet and I was reminded of the famous line from ""A Christmas Story"", ""You're going to put your eye out"".The problem though is that the toy doesn't alway respond to the commands from the remote. It seems to freeze up like a software problem. This meant that after a 1/2 dozen times of not working, my son quickly lost interest. That's a steep drop off for a $[...] toy."
4,Learning something new everyday.,"If there is a shortcut I will usually find it, however there is no way to know everyone of the shortcuts. That's why this book is so helpful because it puts together hundreds of shortcuts that will not only save you time, but also increase productivity as well.While the book is written for XP and Office 2003; some of the shortcuts work in 2000 and earlier versions of Office as well. The author has really done you a great service in putting everything in one place.Broken down first by the XP , then explorer and the each office application, you have hundreds of faster and easier ways to accomplish tasks. I was really glad the explorer was included as very few books ever cover this area.Overall this is one book to have around as a handy reference."
5,The Bomb,This is probably the best Tex/Mex album ever made. Everyone I have played this for has become an instant fan. There was nothing like the Sir Douglas Quintet in the sixties. They were truly one of a kind. As a person who grew up around Mexican music I think that this was the logical next step. ... this might be the best album ever made period.
1,Crapiest album heard in 10 years,"This album is a poorly produced thin live album, poorly mixed at that. If you are looking for the Mercury label original hit versions of Mendocino, Dynamite Woman and She's Abour a Mover look elsewhere. Amazon.com should be ashamed to let this rubbish onto their website mine is off to the trash can, it only arrived today. Another album of counterfeit music. I have been taken for a ride at a cost to me. No indication in the original description as to the validity of the tracks on this album. If I could give a rating of minus 5000 stars I would."
3,"a compilation, not the first album",the track listings above are wrong. this cd is a sir douglas quintet compilation. not the first album. i believe it's german in origin. it has both hits and covers. i thought i was buying the quintet's first album. this aint it. beware.
2,"BUYER BEWARE: Same title, missing songs","This 1999 CD on NEON with the included cover art is missing the best songs from the original ""Mendocino"" album. I bought it, having been too young to know these fellas in their heydey. There are 15 tracks on this imported CD, but missing some key tracks such as ""I Don't Want"", ""If You Really Want Me To I'll Go"", ""I Wanna Be Your Mama Again"", ""At the Crossroads"", ""Lawd, I'm Just a Country Boyin This Great Big Freaky City"" and ""Oh, Baby, It Just Don't Matter"". Which is MOST OF THE ALBUM. This edition collects a boatload of covers that every garage band around performed coming up... My bad for not checkin' I hope I save y'all some of your hard-earned dollars. I gave it two stars only because it's Sir Doug."
3,Interesting,"This book covers many myths regarding the stock market in a readable, interesting way. However, the book overly focused on the bad side. Although the book is suitable for beginners in investing, long time value investors might not get the same portion of benefit. Most of the advise are the view of value investors. What I like most is the book contains a great deal of financial history, dated back to 16th century."
2,Why write if you don't have anything to say,"Short stories about the darker side of investing. Nice if you can read in the investment colums of your local newspaper, but there are better books on the market worth buying."
5,Java for Dummies Review,"I applaud the job that Barry Burd did in writing this book. This book is a good introduction to a programmer looking to be able to program in Java. The book has some good examples that the reader can walk through and experiment with on his/her own. If you are looking to find review questions and other things that a typical textbook used for a college course would have, this isn't the book for you. However, if you're looking for a book that is an easy read (and won't put you to sleep), look no further - this is the one you want."
5,A great introduction,"I am a mature University student studying Web Development and Programming.I needed a gentle introduction to Java, and this book has provided just that.It takes the reader by the hand and introduces all of the basic concepts in an informative and uncomplicated manner (not an easy task).The author is also very accesible.I had a problem with some code and he responded to my email within hours.(He pointed me to a posting on his Weblog which did just the trick).I approached Java with some trepidation but thanks to Mr Burd I am now feeling very confident about tackling the more complicated issues.I am also more than holding my own at University.I can`t thank the author enough.An introduction to Java that I would highly recommend to anyone."
4,THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR BEGINNERS WHO ARE INTRESTED IN JAVA,"What can i say, if you ever want to learn JAVA then this is your book. For some time i have found it hard to understand the basics in java, most of the books i have read gave me headaches they are just to complex but this book by Proff Barry Baud is an absolute knockout. The intresting thing about the book is the manner in which he wrote the book its very easy to undestand complex topics are broken down into bits and pecies that you can undestand."
3,OK if you already know another programming language,"This book seemed to be more of a Java for C Programmers, rather than a Java for Dummies. I guess that's OK, but my son was really hoping for a book that started from square one. So if you're a good programmer in another language, this book will shepherd you through Java differences pretty well. If you only know a language like HTML and want to be able to program applications in Java, not so good."
5,Brilliant!,"Absolutely 100% satisfied with this book! The Java content is logically presented in an order which builds upon itself, so in the end you will be able to understand and compose complicated code by breaking it down into smaller and cleaner parts. Seeing how these smaller parts come together and interact with one another is brilliant, and high praise to the author for his presentation of this information. The presentation is sensible, and fun to read, as Barry is a comical guy!NOTEIf you have no programming experience and you want to learn Java, here is what to do for optimal (and I mean optimal!) understanding of the language:1- Read Barry's other Java book titled ""Beginning Programming with Java For Dummies""2 THEN read this book (Java For Dummies)"
4,A Good Jumpstart For Old Programmers.,As someone who programmed in BASIC FORTRAN Pascal HPL and infequently COBOL back in the eighties this has been a good book for reintroduction. Once I start actual programming I can turn to the dozens of resources out there. This book does what none of them do...get you through all those `what the **** are they talking about` moments that keep experienced programmers from getting back in the game and doing what the young guys cant.
5,Great way to learn Java!,This book is great for beginners to launch into a Java career and an excellent point of reference for the advanced Java software developer as well. Barry Burd presents a wide range of examples and analogies to help the reader grasp Java from any angle.
3,From a Pro (not Only) King James Admirer,"First, I have not read ""Misquoting Jesus"", but I think that Burrough's review presents Ehrman's views fairly.The book is (as other reviewers have noted)largely a selection of quotes of what others write about Ehrman's work.Bart Ehrman's book takes the ""Critical Text"" (eg. Nestle Aland) to its logical conclusion ;"" we cannot be sure we have the Word of God, therefore what is called the Word of God cannot be trusted"". I strongly disagree with that proposition, but that is where Bart Ehrman is coming from! More moderate advocates of that position (such as Dillon Burroughs) are embarrassed about this logical conclusion.(see pages 8,19&32 for example) What they (ie. Dillon et al) need to tell us quite unequivocably is whether passages such as John 7:53 to 8:11 are in the Bible. Bart Ehrman says no, I say yes, but at least I know where Bart stands!"
1,Pamphlet,"This is not a serious book, it is just a pamphlet. Mr. Burroughts is totally biased and just uses misleading arguments. Reading this book was a total waste of time."
2,Misquoting Misquoting Jesus,"This is a fundamentally fundamental partially-misunderstood 'gut reaction' to a theistically superbly sound and utterly convincingt series of biblical textual arguments.At this incredible price, it's really difficult to imagine the author has a purely faith-based reason to regurgitate other people's ""pre-digested"" and utterly unbelievable religious pap.Maybe I'm wrong, but this 'author' makes me seriously doubt the authenticity of his reasons.Still, if pap is your preferred mode of reasoning, you'll love this to bits."
2,Don't read this if you're pregnant!!,"I am 4 months pregnant and got this book as a gift. I'm not sure if the person who bought it for me realized what it was about. As an expectant mom reading stories of the troubles people had conceiving and carrying children, it made me depressed and anxious - what if my child has Down's syndrome, what if it's stillborn, etc. So, if you have had trouble conceiving, by all means, this book is great support. I believe people need to ""bond"" with others who share similar trials and tribulations. But if you are not, and are easily spooked, I'd suggest picking up something more light-hearted and happy."
2,The woman who labored him...........grrr,"If you are a birth mother stay away from this book. It will make you feel guilty for not procreating so you can give away your child to another woman who has more--more money, and a pony in the backyard. One writer--one of the editors, Jill Bialosky, can not even bring herself to call the natural mother of her child a mother; instead she calls her ""the woman who labored him."" Gag. Yes, that woman is her ""definition of a Messiah."" Given the rest of the essay, and yes, Bialosky did go through hell trying to conceive and have a living child, but please--birth mothers do not have babies to supply women who can't. Better to read The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood."
2,"Cute sweater, but cheaply made!","I bought four of these sweaters for my dogs; two red and two blue. They are dachshunds one is 8lbs (size small) and one is 14lbs (size medium.) The sizing is more for the length of the sweater than the circumference of their chest/belly.Pros+cute+rich color with contrasting arms and neck edge+has an opening on the back for a harnessCons-Poorly constructed (my medium sized dog's sweater ripped in the arm after the first use and no activity - she has a heart condition, physical activity is not even possible)-back leg straps - this may be a positive for some, but I prefer not to have the back straps, they always seem to get tangled in them-does not wash up nicely - material pilled even after being washed gently with WooliteI had two other of these sweaters on back-order, but I immediatly cancelled them as it was a waste of money. I would not recommend these sweaters."
3,About What You'd Expect for the Price-I Like It,"This was a last-minute purchase as I had decided to adopt a dog in mid-winter and wanted a sweater quickly. He is a small Jack Russell terrier, about 15 pounds, and the dimensions work well for his body type. The color is nice and it's an average quality sweater. It probably won't last more than one more season. Very cute though. I really don't get the let straps on these and I just cut them off. One thing I do like on this model that I don't have on my other dogs' sweaters is the snug little cuffs around the front leg openings. They have enough give to get the sweater on but then do a nice job of keeping it from twisting around. It would be nice to find this style made of a heavier knit."
3,"Nice length, but thin","The sweater is long on the top, which is very nice. The leg straps were useless. Not only did they bother our pup, but they stretched out after two days. This also meant it seemed likely she would pee on them so we cut them off. The sweater is thin. I expected a cable knit sweater to be thicker/warmer. Also, the neck stretched out very quickly, allowing the whole thing to move down on her body easily.The sizing it also a bit funny. These aren't for broad chested dogs. By the measurement this should fit fine but it's tight across our pup's chest. It worked for us in a pinch but I wouldn't recommend this as an every day, practical item."
3,cute...but!,Bought this for my dog and he looked beyond adorable in it. BUT the material stretches out so the neck hole became a shoulder hole! also it ripped easily :(
4,Nice Sweater,"This sweater fits my 17lb Jack Russel mix very snugly and she must find it nice and warm because she did not whine when we got into the cold car like she does with her old coat. It covers about 2/3 of her tummy. The sleeves are short, though. Still she seems to like it."
