2,A little Lacking,"I acutually just bought a Toshiba Gigabeat F20 to replace this unit after being overally disappointed with the performance of this unit. The Toshiba has the same price point with a larger hard drive and a larger screen also. I could never get my photos to show up on the Phililps, a feature I was very excited about when I got the unit home. All the music disappeared off my unit a couple of times and the front controls are just to sensative. I've only had the Toshiba for about a day now and already I much happier with the unit. I was actually able to transfer my photos onto the unit with a problem."
2,Time Consuming Problem,"Battery life is horrible, songs disappear after connecting to sync with my PC, freezes on me once in a while, overall it's a waste of time to even figure out the problem because it happens constantly."
2,Didnt like it,"The best thing about this player is the looks!You have to buy better headphones to get some decent sound, the equalizer is pretty weak. Though its pretty easy to use, the cons for this player easily outweigh the pros."
1,Darn... I shoulda bought an iPod,"Well, I don't know how iPods really are, but people seem to like them. Here I thought I was being slick buying this... has more memory and is cheaper than an iPod, and it's just as slick and cool... NOT! My original one broke in like a month or two, so I got a new one, and now it doesn't even recognize my music files, even when it tells me that it has synced them all. Not to mention the battery doesn't last that long, and the rubber outer cover collects dust and lint. The earbuds were comfy, but I soon broke off the end of that soon enough (then I bought another pair of Philips earbuds, and they didn't work out for me either... I not hate the Philips company.) Don't buy this MP3 player unless if you feel like torturing yourself and throwing away your money. It still looks cool, that's about its only plus in the end."
1,Poduct has had problems,Happy with the service but the product has been giving us problems. It has problems finding the computer and doesn't work half the time.
2,"Poor battery life, ""blotchy"" appearance","I loved this MP3 player when I first received it - I thought it sounded great and looked very cool. BUT I was unhappy to discover how ""blotchy"" it looks after even minimal handling - it vividly shows every single fingerprint & smudge on every surface of the player. AND despite boasting a robust battery life, I could never get it to play longer than 2+ hours without needed to recharge it (even after trying every suggestion in the owner's manual and on the Philips website). I decided to return it and get an iRiver, which has worked great."
1,2 times defective,The first one we bought had a faulty display and music kept disappearing. Tech support was rude & dismissive. And the voice recognition menus to get there were torturous. We exchanged the unit for another one. This one will not load music correctly. Tech support is again unable to help. We are returning #2 and getting another brand entirely. Beware of Phillips. Lousy support. Very difficult product.
2,"Great features, bad shelf-life","I really enjoyed the ease of use and other fun features like the picture albums. The battery life was fantastic. The integration with Windows media player was great (no third party P2P needed). But...notice I am writing in past tense...the hard-drive died a couple of months into my deployment to Afghanistan. Not a great time to be without tunes. So I contacted customer support. At first they said it was out of warranty. Which was weird, because they only started making them less than a year ago!? Then they said they would replace it, but I couldn't ship it to them from overseas. So I had to ship it back to my wife who had to call philips and get an RMA and a UPS label and finally ship it to the factory and get it back and mail it back to me. Anyway, I am not too impressed with the quality of the product or the customer service experience."
3,A pretty good mp3 player,"I bought this mp3 player about a year ago, and its been a pretty good one so far. It has excellent picture quality and the scrolling bar in the middle is very nice. I have 2 complaints about it.1. I have had to send it back because when i turned it on, it gave me an error message and i couldn't do anything on it. After they sent me a new one it worked just fine.2. Once you put a lot of songs on it (close to 1,000 or so) it starts to perform slowly. For example if i choose to play a song, it will take at least 5 seconds to start playing, and then another 20 seconds to load up the songs information. And it gets really annoying.All in all i think it is a pretty good mp3 player for the price, but i would suggest (if u dont want an ipod) to get Creative because that is the other mp3 player i had, and i am thinking of getting another one from Creative."
1,Junk and customer service is a bad joke,"Just bought this HDD1630 and spent 2 hours trying to get it to work. Tech support was the worst, like speaking to a rock. Sorry, a rock has more knowledge then Philips tech support. Installed all of their software and was told that Philips onlys sells the mp3 player but dose not support the software. In short if you want to waste your time and pull your hair out then I would go out and buy this Philips product now. If you want to listen to music or audio books then do what I did and return this piece of junk and go out and buy a sandisk for less money and enjoy."
5,I Love This Player !!!!!,"This player is great !! I have had mine for 3 months now. I use it almost ever day. It is easy to use. Slick black look, wonderful color display. Easy to use. I have the iriver fm transmitter to plug it in to in the car. They work great together. With 6 GB I can fit more than enough of my music."
1,Loved it til it quit completely on day 3,"The color is great, blue light is definitely sexy. Touch navigation was sensitive and easy to use. Uploading music was a breeze. Sound was great, even the color display was equal to my cell phone. Options for saving battery life (backlight timing, skin options, etc) nice touch. Slipped right into my pocket while shopping. Well all that is past tense because today (the 3rd day) I attempt to turn it on to fully discharge the battery before recharging and it will not even power up. I figure it was in need of charging, so I plug it in to the wall... no life. Change outlets, no life. I plug it into the USB and it shows nothing. I'm so sad. I love this little thing and now I may have to get an iPod which makes me feel like a sell out. If anyone else had this problem and it is easily fixed, drop me a line. I want to keep it, but only if it will work."
2,Great...for 2 days.,"I did lots of research before purchasing this product. When I decided on it, I knew I was taking a chance. It arrived and I was extremely excited. It charged great. Adding Mp3s was so simple. The fm tuner was amazing. The voice recording was surprisingly ok. Then, on the third of having it in my possession, it just quit. I charged it. I let it rest. It just wouldn't turn back on. I had barely used it. I hope that it just happened to be the one I received. If so, I would change my rating in a heart beat. The two is for 2 days it did work. The main problem is that now I am very scared of buying an mp3 player. I don't know who to trust."
4,Love it when it works (aka MOST of the time),"I've had my Go Gear for over a year and most of the time its wonderful. The battery lasts me all day, sound is great, no problem with navigation. Then there are the times when it acts up...For some reason, and I can't identify any cause, there are times when the battery doesn't charge fully and when navigating back to the main menu doesn't work smoothly.There have been a few times when the player has frozen up, but these are pretty rare and were resolved with the soft reset (pwr + up vol).The rubber cover that comes with the player is all but useless, so I wish I had purchased the control case from the start so my player wouldn't have the few scratches it has on the front. With the control case, the player is fully protected and can be hung on a belt loop or pack.Over all, I really like this player. It has been a great alternative to the iPOD empire and I would buy Philips again."
1,piece of crap....waste of money,"this thing worked semi well for the first month. it lagged alot but the colors were good. month later, the headphones blow out but they were crap from the begining. then it starts lagging to the point where i have to reset it. then today i turned it on and it said hook up to computer. it read it as a hard disk and i cant fix it now. hopefully phillips can replace it or something. even so, dont waste your money. i havent heard any complaining about the ipod so you might as well buy it. its compatable with pcs so i guess its ok...thats how pissed i am. im supporting the ipod."
1,Nothing but problems,It worked great for about 2 weeks and after that it has turned into nothing more than a problem. Don't spend your money on this product it is horrid. I don't think that I used this more than 10 times.
4,good when it works,mine broke and I had to send it back. It took a month before it came back. The best thing about it is that it is napster to go compatable. In napster to go you can get as many songs as you want for free. but you don't own them its more like renting. you only have to pay 15$ a month.there is a couple of songs you do have to buy sometimes though.one bad thing is that if you are at like all tracks and your at song 400 or something you have skip through the rest of the songs and it takes really long so if you do that you should just reset it. When you turn it off it might have a little clock and it takes awhile before its really off when it is doing that don't reset because you will lose all your all your songs and you'll have to download them all over and if you have a lot of songs it takes a long time.to reset hold the power button and the + volume for 3 seconds.
1,Died after 10 days...,"I got this to replace a Zen Micro because the store didn't have a replacement. What a mistake! Although it is very sleek looking and the color screen is nice, there are too many negatives to ignore. The headphones sound awful, I had to use a pair I already had. The interface is very cumbersome and it was PAINFULLY slow to transfer music to the device, because I had to download first to Windows Media Player--you cannot transfer directly from a CD to the device. I also don't like the control buttons on the side, and the hold button does not eliminate the change in volume. Not a great design.Also, after 10 days it died. Nothing, nada--lost all data (but it is all on my PC with media player), and it wouldn't take a charge. I am getting another Micro. Much better device for the money, and much easier to use.I was very disappointed."
1,Weak,"The product as a presentation is fantastic, the packaging, the design, the earphones.. everything looks fantastic and great right?! but when it comes to the device itself, OMG! it's absolutely horrible, I've used it maybe 5 times, and it never worked after that, it said it had hard disk damage! I've taken care of this device and I've never dropped it or contributed into something that could've damaged it. I would say the device is WEAK. I still have everything; s for the stuff and the durability is fine, but when it comes for the stuff to actually work : FAIL. I regret buying it and I don't know what to do with it, it's just sitting there. My advice is to buy something more than 50% of the people on earth have, so everyone is familiar with it; as for MP3 players, Apple iPods are the best, hands down."
3,interesting plot,"Unlike most horror movies that deal with ghosts or blood and gore, this movie is propelled by its great plot, which is biblically based, and pulls the watcher into a battle between good and evil, where they sit at the edge of their chair and pray for the best."
3,Weak Story,"This movie was for the most part disappointing, but there were several aspects of the production that deserve praise. During the commentary, the director repeatedly points out that this movie was filmed on a low budget and in nineteen days. Considering those limitations, the movie turned out quite well. The acting was anywhere from acceptable to quite good (the guy who played the old man was especially good) and the musical score was very nicely done. The production values were also quite good. What was truly substandard was the story. There were awkward Biblical references. There was melodrama. There was heavy-handed use of symbols. There were also short cuts taken in the plot that were a little hard to ignore. I'm sure that if there had been more time to film this movie, much of the story would have been revised, but a weak story is kind of hard to overlook and so I feel generous in awarding three stars to this movie!"
1,Not so good,"Sometimes you're just in the mood for a good scary movie. This is not it. Bad acting, bad story. I see why it was a $0.99 download!!"
5,"A superb, readable reference work!","As odd as this may sound for a reference work, I found (& continue to find) this book a joy to read. Ammer covers almost every known cliche, always aptly noting whether they are currently in use or on the way out (""obsolescent""). Her style is breezy & literary at the same time, & her research into origins is impressive and entertaining. This is a book I often take off my shelf - not only for clarification of cliches that wing my way, but for sheer readability. Quite a feat!"
4,Informative but dull,"Informative, yes. This ""dictionary"" lists 3000 worn out phrases that writers ought to avoid. It gives a contemporary definition of each along with an historical background. The cover design and title suggest that the book would also provide some entertainment. It does not."
3,Seems to work OK with a Macbook Pro,"I picked up the PNOTEAC150 a couple of days ago and am now actually writing this review from a field 51 miles SW of Washington DC using this inverter. The PNOTEAC150 is plugged into an Optima Yellow 12v gel battery. I've been doing email and surfing the web for 30 minutes with no problems. The only surprise so far is the motor noise that comes from the PNOTEAC150. It seems to cycle on and off...not sure if it is a fan or what. But so far, so good. The MacBook Pro's 85w power adapter seems to be happy plugged into this APC inverter."
5,so good,"this book is funny, real, humble, and grand. as a 30 year old searching for her own place in the world after working in advertising as well, it wholly resonated."
1,Couldn't Finish,"I was looking forward to reading this book, as I engage in yoga regularly and was curious about the ""India/Ashram"" experience. Unfortunately, I found the book to be poorly written (and poorly edited), and stopped about half-way through. The text jumps around, she refers to characters that have little or no context, and employs too many unique British references and terminology. All in all a disappointment."
4,Race Wrench Set,"This is a high quality wrench set, and the colored caps match industry standards. I am a big Losi/TLR fan and I have both race wrench and nut drive sets. The handles are not quite as comfortable as they could be, and that is why I took 1 star off the rating.As a side note the 22, 22T, and 22SCT require a 1mm wrench for a single screw in the rear pivot. This screw is actually optional, but it makes assembly MUCH easier. I mention this because the smallest wrench in the set is a 1.5mm."
3,Ok book for hygiene lessons,"This book is a good book for certain types of student and home school groups- but not for all. If some groups learn better with scare tactics then this book is recommended for you. In general it is an entertaining book but the use of scare tactics to teach hygiene principles can often have a negative effect. It really depends on the make up of the audience you will be reading this book with.This book becomes a better read when you pair it with a hygiene lesson, contrasting book (one focused on the positive benefits of good hygiene) or infection control activity. It is not recommended to center a whole hygiene lesson around this book.OUTFOXOUTFOXprevention.com"
1,This book will make your little ones paranoid.,"This book repeatedly emphasizes that germs are mean and that they are everywhere and that their sole purpose is to GET YOU. Very scary, actually. It puts them in your body, in your food, in the air and the miminally addressed topic of keeping yourself clean does not banish them. The next page just puts them all back somewhere else. It is not clear at all that handwashing, not letting other people sneeze on you, washing the floor, not leaving food overnight on the counter are effective ways to keep healthier. The emphasis is on a ton of very cute cartoony germs in multitudes. The health aspects are implied only--and poorly at that. Behaviors like nose-picking are RIDICULED. Not good for kids up to about age 10, especially if you're trying to teach health and cleanliness issues."
1,Chef Harvey 5 Piece Garnishing Tools (#4400T),"I purchased the Chef Harvey 5 Piece Garnishing Set. It consisted of a corrugated garnishing tool, food decorator, spiral slicer, twin curl cutter and paring knife. With shipping and handling it cost $22.00. The food decorator is made out of such thin metal it feels like it will cut your hand if you give it a firm grip. The spiral slicer has a thick plastic screw tip that splits the carrots rather than cutting them in a spiral. Twin curl cutter is just as cheap to the look and feel. Not surprisingly, at the bottom of the invoice, it says ""thanks for your order - non returnable"". So even the company must know it's an inferior product."
4,useful,"ok, this is not top-notch instruments or tools - but they can help you garnish some banquets/tables with a more professional and intricate look.the instructions and pictures are lousy, but you can play aroundbe creative and imaginative - it is culinary arts after all.for a cheap price, they are ok to have.I used them in a catering class when we were doing fruit/veggie carvings"
1,what happened to all the other characters!?,"heh i don't even have this figure and i don't intend to get it i just thought id but in.so,crap!!!! do they only sell the girl characters!!!? what happened to tidus,auron,cloud,amarant,beret,viviand so on.where are the cool characters!?"
4,characters,There is to much repetition of the characters. Other wise the book makes a good read. It was short enough that I didn't get bored.
5,Lovin Every Minute Of It,"I love this series! Mind you I have only read the first and second book, but it's not often that in the middle of reading I can just laugh out loud-hysterically! The sense of humor the author portrays is right up my alley! Maybe not the perfect book(s) for everyone but certainly an A+ for me. Happy reading all!"
1,Garbage,"What garbage. I heard some good things about this series on the radio and read the reviews online. All seemed to be in order until I read the first few pages.What simplistic, bombastic garbage. Cardboard characters, a weak storey line, and an unbelievablely cavalier attitude to violence (even for people from New Jersey - I never realized they all had a ""Bruce Willis"" nerve in the face of life threatening danger for themselves and their families).My biggest mistake was purchasing two of these sad sack books at once. I worry about the state of popular reading when the reviews for this series are so positive."
5,Stephanie Returns....,"....and this time her crazy grandmother joins her. This book is a great follow-up to ""One for the Money"". Stephanie is up to all of her usual tricks again! Hard to put down and yet another book that will have you laughing out loud."
5,Worth the Dough,"This second in the Stephanie Plum (bounty hunter) series is just as good as the first. With Joe Morelli as a sexy supporting character who was in the first one, Stephanie hunts for a crazy idiot who's chopping off body parts at the local funeral parlor. Grandma Mazur is hilarious - if this got made into a movie, she'd be up for an Oscar. Read it and enjoy it as much as I did."
4,I'm PLUM fascinated,"Okay, I only gave ""Two For The Money"" four stars. But I think Janet may have gotten into a hurry in writing her second PLUM novel and quit too quick. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but not as much as the first PLUM novel. And I'm already out of order with my numbers since I've read High Five before #3 & #4. But I did purchase the third and fourth novels and Full House, so I have a lot of reading to keep me busy. Janet has some really greats characters for some really outstanding plots. She's witty and I love to read her dialogue. This is great!!!!"
4,janet evanovich,Janet Evanovich and Stephanie Plum are as usual a wonderful combination. If you like action adventure with a little humor this is the series for you.
5,Great follow-up,"This is of course only the second out of fourteen, but that doesn't lessen it's quality. This is a fun adventure in the Stephanie Plum series. I highly recommend it and the rest of them if you can get your hands on them!"
5,Another great book,This is a great book. It has a good plot and also a lot of humor. I found myself laughing out loud as I read this book which got me looks from several strangers as I read it on the way to work. It's the comic timing that make all the characters enjoyable and keep the mystery plots exciting.
4,Enjoyable read.,The sexual tension between Stephanie and Joe is great and Grandma Mazur is a quite a character. Can`t wait to read book 3.
4,Great Series,"I love this series, this is my second time reading it and it's just as good as before! Still hilarious, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and is a def page turner!"
5,Plum series,"I love the Stephanie Plum series. I catch myself laughing out loud while reading these books. Highly recommended for a fun, light read."
4,Outstanding! Can't get enough!,"The first book was kind of slow, but I pressed on and read the second and boy am I glad I did. This series is WONDERFUL! Excitement, romance, mystery, everthing! This book, as well as any of the other book after it in this series, leaves you wanting more. As you read through the series you get close to the characters, watch them grow and you want to know what will happen to them next. Janet Evanovich is a fantastic writer who really knows how to get you involved in the story. She is discript enough when creating images for you to think about, but still allows you to use your imagination. As you read through the series you may notice how the characters evolve, there is always something new to learn about them. I laughed out loud, I became tearful, I got mad, I got scared while reading these books. Truly a treasure. I cant wait for Hard Eight to come out so I can see what Stephanie will do next!"
5,"Way to go, Janet","A rip-roaring ride of a novel. Funny, fast-paced and a well-written. I'd recommend it to anyone"
5,Better than the first book,"Sometimes the second book in a series is a letdown. Not this time. Two for the dough is even better than Evanovitch's first novel. This time I liked it enough to actually purchase the hardcover edition. Something I usually only do with authors like Grafton, Kellerman and Clancy.I recommend this book highly, but I really think you deserve to read the series in order, because the first book builds to the second."
2,Two for the Dough,"I read this book. OK for light reading. Definitely a ""chick"" book. May read another book in this series. Fast read."
4,Great Series,This is the 2nd of the series and I'm looking forward to reading more of the Stephanie Plum series....very entertaining read.
5,I've never been a reader but I'm hooked!,I really hate ready but this book kept me wanting to read more. I can't wait to start the next book!
5,Awesome,I love all of these books!!! Have read the whole series before and looking forward to reading them again! Janet is truly an amazing writer!!!
4,Terrific Fun in the Second in the Series...,"This second book in the Stephanie Plum series is a laugh riot, especially with Grandma Mazur along for the ride. As much fun as the first, and a must -- the series just gets better as it goes along. Perfect escapist fiction, yet with a heroine who always feels real."
4,Spectacular sequel!,"Not only does bounty hunter Stephanie Plum have the addition of a taser alongside her .38 Smith and Wesson, but now's she's on the hunt for FTA Kenny Mancuso, who is notorious for chopping body parts off of dead people. Tracking Kenny will earn her 10% of his $50,000 bond, but will also land her the duty as the bodygaurd of an undertaker. Not only does she have the backup of Joe Morelli, but Grandma Mazur has tagged along with an unsuspected .45 Magnum.This novel is a fantastic sequel, and will keep you curious for what happens in the following book. It's action packed, but let's face it. It doesn't hold ANYTHING up to ""One for the Money"". However, it does make you absolutely hooked to the series. On that note, be sure you start at the beginning with ""One for the Money"", and then you'll have the entire scoop before starting this one!"
4,"Fun Continues...Evanovich ""Two"" For Two","Hopefully, ""Two For The Dough"" and the other books in the Stephanie Plum novels are not just for the ladies (or maybe the fairer sex are just the ones writing all these review here on Amazon). This is by no means a ""chick"" book. Having whipped through the first two books of the series, I have thoroughly enjoyed the breezy plots, laugh-out-loud humor and memorable characters (who are quickly become old friends). ""Two"" finds Stephanie still stumbling and bumbling through her new career as bounty-hunter extraordinaire. One of the first book's most endearing characters, Grandma Mazur, has an increased role in ""Two"" as a pistol-packing granny whose primary social activity is attending funerals in the ""burg."" ""Two"" won't win any literary awards, but that's not the point (truly ""entertaining"" movies rarely win Oscars either). I plan on keeping a little behind Evanovich's writing schedule so I am not without the next Stephanie Plum book."
4,I Think I Pulled Something Laughing So Hard!,"In this installment, Stephanie Plum is chasing after Kenny Mancuso. Mancuso is from the 'Burg and just shot his best friend in the knee cap in broad daylight. Several days after that incident, the best friend is found dead and Mancuso is the prime suspect.Stephanie becomes involved and all hell breaks loose! With her Grandma Mazur in tow, Stephanie funeral hops, hangles the neighbors and loses yet another car in this fast paced adventure! It was completely and totally entertaining and I wish I had found this series a lot sooner!"
5,Another very funny book,"I am really enjoying reading Ms. Evanovich's books. She is a great writer. There's not much romance, but there is Joe, the cop who argues back and forth with Stephanie. Enough to let you know that there is something between them. I'll just bet they will hit it off big time before this series is over. I love Grandma Majur. She really adds to the book. She is one funny character. One incident I remember is Joe had to go on police business, but did not want Grandma to know, so he told her he was going to the dentist. She said that he should be like her, she just mails her teeth in. No matter what the price of these books, they are WORTH IT!!!!"
4,Two for the Dough,"I truely enjoyed this book, the second book in the Stephanie plum series. Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down"
3,Not Quite as Good as the First One,"Although I enjoyed the first book in the series more, this book was also entertaining. I missed Ranger, Stephanie's fellow bounty hunter in this book. His character is wonderful, and I hope we see more of him. This book got a little ridiculous with Granny Mazur. I understand that there are eccentric senior citizens out there, but I found the doings with Granny took away from the rest of the story. She seemed somehow fake and overdone. But Stephanie's just as good as ever, and beautiful Morrelli is there too. In this book, Stephanie is trying to find Kenny Mancuso - a real live wire from the burg. As she closes in on her prey she finds that she is the recipient of some very dubious presents from the guy she's trying to bring in. You'll have to read to find out all the hilarious antics."
4,Great fun,A fun read. I had started reading the Plum books at #16. I liked it so much I decided to start from the beginning.
2,Boring no offense.,This book was a little boring. No offense. What I liked was the relationship of plum and marelli.What i didn't like was that it wasn't that adventurous as one for the money.
5,Great Book Series,"The producted was packaged well, was exactly what I wanted, received what I order and it was in great shaped when received....."
5,Nails it again!,Awesome second book in the continuing Saga of the famous or infamous bounty hunter. Book has some humor to make you laugh and leaves you wanting to get to know the characters better. Looking forward to book #3!
4,Hasn't Hollywood read these great books?,"I'm getting to like Stephanie Plum, Trenton's most unlikely bounty-hunter. I especially like Grandma Mazur, Trenton's answer to Dirty Harry! Stephanie could stick with the small-time bond-jumpers, but they don't pay enough, so she feels the need to make a comparatively big score by bringing in Kenny Mancuso, charged with shooting his cousin Moogey in the knee. But then Moogey gets dead and the odds go up. And stolen Army weapons enter the picture. And so does Joe Morelli, one of Trenton's finest and also Kenny's cousin. It's a complicated plot but Evanovich handles it very well and with considerable wry humor. She's also very good at delineating the scarier characters and assorted sociopaths who crop up. What I want to know is, why hasn't there been a movie made from this series? The scene in the beauty parlor and the last scene in the funeral home basement would make terrific footage. I see someone like Renee Zellweger as Stephanie. . . ."
5,ANOTHER WINNER!!!,"Well, America's favorite bounty hunter is at it again. She's on the hunt for Kenny Mancuso--a sociopathic Trenton native who's jumped bail. The hunt for Kenny is a rip-roaring adventure; Stephanie is forced to frequent all of the Trenton funeral homes in her search--much to Grandma Mazur's delight, who likes to frequent the viewings!From the antics of Grandma involving corpses at funeral homes, to body parts appearing in Stephanie's refrigerator, this novel is a lot of fun to ride through. To add to the reader's delight is of course the handsome Joe Morelli throughout---and the action between he and Steph is definitely heating up!Just when you thought the second could not have possibly be as good as the first, Ms. Evanovich is here to prove you wrong. Enjoy...I certainly did!!"
5,Two for the Dough,This is a excellent book to listen to on audio I was tempted to relisten again. I would give 10 stars.
3,Satisfactory read,Enjoyable quick read and interesting characters. Certainly not an overly suspenseful read but adequate for a weekend spent leisurely reading by the fire or on the beach. No thinking required.
3,Two for the money,Stephanie Plum character is fun and lots of laughs. The mystery part of the book is there but not as intriguing as say Lee Child's Jack Reacher. But it's interesting and entertaining.
5,great,I thought the book was a great read. It is different then anything I have read before. I look forward to reading the rest of the series.
4,Cops and Comedy,"I generally read murder mystery series with recurring characters because I like how the character evolves over time. Although I don't expect comic relief in a murder mystery(and most have very dark characters) Janet Evanovich has taken the genre in a new direction. Her Stephanie Plum books are fun, easy to read, and down right hilarious and by the way - they also include murder. If I was to compare Evanovich's character to another in the same genre I would compare Plum to Archie McAnally, Lawrence Sander's Palm Beach Detective. If you want deep reading you may consider something more like the Harry Bosch series by Michael Connelly but if you enjoy reading and laughing you should read this entire series. Grandma Mazur is a hoot. One suggestion though, read the first book to see if you like it and then you better just order the whole series because if you read like me you'll be going through a book every couple of days."
4,Stephanie Plum..,series is the greatest. The characters are enjoyable and the humor is terffic I'm hooked on the series.
1,OMG are you Kidding....??? WHY 4/12 stars???,"This book was terrible. I cannot believe I even wasted my time with this typical, boring story line that felt like I was reading a bad murder mystery tv show. The characters didn't entrigue me in the slightest. And at no point did I ever think that the book was humorous. Did I miss something?? The only thing this book is good for is to have some easy light reading of a story that is so unmemorable that you will forget it the moment you put down the book. I just don't understand the draw to this type of book, with so many other good books out there... Snow FLower and the Secret Fan by Lisa See for example...."
3,Eh,"TWO FOR THE DOUGH by Janet EvanovichIn Janet Evanovich's TWO FOR THE DOUGH, Stephanie Plumb is staking out funeral homes and discovering detached body parts. Her latest bounty: Kenny Mancuso, Joe Morelli's cousin. She'll have to decide if Joe's loyalties are to his family or to the law.I liked seeing the characters once more and couldn't wait to get to know them better. But by the time I finished the book, I didn't feel like I knew them any more than when I started reading. There was limited action and suspense and when the third body part showed up, I rolled my eyes and put down the book. From listening to other readers, I'm aware that there is a love triangle with the main character's but at this point in the series, I didn't feel any chemistry between Joe and Stephanie.Oh, well, I did give the series a try with two books."
3,Typical Mass Market Paperback,"Decent for what it is. Don't expect to build your word power. Grandma gets the laughs, and the heroine is a believable character you could have gone to high school with, only you ended up with job X and she ended up a bounty hunter. A decent beach read. Probably should read these Stephanie Plum books in sequence."
5,Two for the Dough,"Janet Evanovitch is the funnieset, wittiest author I have ever read. Love her books! I usually buy them used and they come in good condition."
4,good and easy read,Very good book. Just got hooked on this series after seeing the movie. Only on book 3 but so far they have eady reads.
4,Enjoyable,"This book is a bit predictable, but if you are looking for a light, easy read, as I was for pool reading, then it is perfect! Stephanie Plum makes me chuckle."
4,Love these books,These books are so fun - I am re-reading the entire series. I think I read them so fast the first time (because they are so much fun) that it almost feels like reading them for the first time.
3,Enjoyable Reading,I have to admit that I do enjoy Stephanie Plum and her grandmother. Heck I sure hope that I am as feisty when I am that age as Grandma.The storyline was interesting. Stephanie has a gift of getting involved in unusual situations that she somehow manages to get herself out of. Of course it doesn't hurt that she has two hunks on speed dial.It is also interesting to read about a time when cellphones weren't so common. Where there was a payphone on every corner. And the Burg itself is like a step back to the 50's. Definitely makes for an interesting storyline.
3,Couldn't wait to finish it,After reading One for the Money I was keen to try the next book in the Stephanie Plum series. Ho Hum. It was amusing and well written but really it seemed so much like the 1st one with the personal life undertoning the book of Stephanie Plum I couldn't wait to finish it and find something new to read. I wouldn't bother with the others this author has written if this style remains throughout all her books. Read the 1st one enjoy it but don't go any further if you like to get variety into your reading.
5,Hysterical,"Stephanie Plum breaks all the rules. She works as a bounty hunter for her cousin Vinnie who is a bail bondsman. She doesn't have the constraints placed on her that a cop or a PI has, or if she does, she ignores them. She's the most honest, real and true character I've come across in a long time. All the characters in this book are wonderful. The cop friend, Morelli is yummy. If he was real he'd probably be high calorie. Grandma Mazur is great. At her age she can get away with anything, and frequently does. She knows a lot about the world...she's seen it on TV. Very few books have ever made me laugh out loud, but this one did. Over and over again. I don't think Janet Evanovich is a rising star. I think she's already there"
2,Definitely not JE's best book,"I like reading Stephanie Plum's novels because although they don't have anything to learn or to think about you'll laugh while you read them,this book doesn't have jokes and the end is heavy as lead, grandma Mazur doesn't have the spark that has in other books, and at the end Morelli knew exactly what happened with the bad guys just because he is a cop. I think JE wanted to finish the book and just put an end to it."
4,fun reading,This book takes the reader through the ups and downs of Stephanie Plum as a bounty hunter. It held my interest and made me laugh out loud. I highly recommend it for fun reading.
5,Stephanie Plum is getting even better!,"This is the second Stephanie Plum book. Could it be as good as ""One for the Money""? Yes! Stephanie's back, and so are her mom, dad, grandma, Morelli, and all the others that made the first book so great! Stephanie is coming into her own in this book. She's working on collecting the bounty on a guy who shot a mechanic in the knee. Then, the mechanic turns up dead. Stephanie is gaining confidence in her job as a bounty hunter. She's even offered a side job by the sleazy funeral director, Spiro. This is a great story. You'll love it!"
4,Plum defeats appendage cutting whacko,"This is another solid and humorous Plum novel. It doesn't move quite as lively as ""One"" did, but it is well worth the effort to read. Profanity is excessive, but hey, its Jersey. Forgeddaboutit."
5,Another plum novel about Stephanie Plum,"Janet Evanovich's sophomore novel on Stephanie Plum, a sassy, funny, plucky bounty hunter from Trenton, N.J., is just as fine as her debut novel, ""One for the Money."" Evanovich's novels are the best thing going in detective fiction today, and it's a pity she's not as well known as Sue Grafton, Ruth Rendell, Lawrence Block or Patricia Cornwell. I like all of them, but Evanovich is even better. It's not often that real suspense and hilarity can coexist in a detective novel. (Block is one of the few others who can pull it off.)Be sure to read these books in order so you don't miss a thing. I won't have to recommend that you read all of the Stephanie Plum books. This Jersey girl is addictive."
4,Another great one,"I have read the whole series and loved them all. Ms. Evanovich does a great job ""linking"" the characters together through out the Stephanie Plum novels; however, the references are not lost on those who have not started with the first in the series."
5,Break up Chocolate Safely for the Home Baker,"I love to bake and make candy with bulk chocolate, but the one aspect of the process that I dread is cutting up the large chunks of chocolate. It is difficult to chop through the hard chocolate with a chefs knife. I find the job unpredictable and somewhat dangerous. This sturdy tool has resolved the issue.I am a home cook, not a professional and I rarely have chunks of chocolate that weigh more than a couple of pounds. This tool permits chipping of the chocolate for melting in a manageable manner. I consider this method far safer than using the chef's knife. The chocolate flies around less, and to help capture the bits that leave the cutting board, I put a large piece of wax paper, or parchment paper under the cutting board.The tool does not produce perfectly consistently sized pieces, like those bags of pre-made chocolate chunks for cookies, but for breaking down bulk chocolate to prepare for melting, this tool does its job."
3,Not as great as I'd hoped,"I bought this primarily for breaking up chocolate in store-sized bars and was a little disappointed. I was hoping to make small, irregular chips. It makes pretty big chunks and they kind of fly around. It is very solid and well-made, and would probably be more useful on large bulk chocolate."
1,"Poor product, waste of money!","This item, while it seems like it will get the job done, is worthless. I purchased this because the chef at the restaurant where I work insists on buying chocolate in those huge 11 lb. blocks. I thought this would be a good way to break apart the block and use what I needed. WRONG! It is much easier just using my 10-inch chef's knife. I guess the only good thing is that I bought it here on Amazon rather than wasting alot more money on this thing at Sur La Table. If I could have, I would've given it 0 stars!"
4,Useful.,"I bought this in order to make chips out of a large block of chocolate. It broke the block up into large pieces, I would guess about an ounce in size each. Further crushing was necessary to get it down to a size appropriate for baking or melting. Using the chipper too close to the block gave me slivers of chocolate instead of chips. Works as intended but require more effort than I expected."
5,The right tool for the job,I can't imagine using anything but this tool to chip the chocolate. This is good quality - sturdy and well-balanced. Feels good in my hands; I can get a good grip.
5,American goldfinch,"The American goldfinch is a bird that I am not all that familiar with and I was pleased to see that the species has been profiled in the Wild Bird Series. Similar to the domesticated canary, the male American goldfinch is readily recognized because of its striking yellow and black plumage. The goldfinch is a bird that can be easily attracted to the backyard by stocking a feeder with thistle-like seeds. (It is largely due to feeders that the American goldfinch is so recognizeable to most, as it has made the species much more common.) As with the other books in the series, the photographs are excellent, but unlike some of the other titles, the text is somewhat more substantial. Overall, and excellent book, truly a joy to read."
4,Unique and Good,I don't know of any other series that will just go on and on about everything you were curious about but afraid ask regarding an individual species. Well done. Pity the series is out of print.
1,MY DOG'S LIPS ARE MISSING!,"I would love to review this item, but is has been more than 2 months since ordering, and I have yet to receive my dog's lips. I have received a couple of emails with excuses...but still no lips. I have paid and am still waiting. My dog had these lips in the past and loved them, but wore them out. I finally located new ones through this vendor and am still waiting. We are not happy. All we want for Christmas are our two front lips............Please Santa!"
4,Buena pieza para diario,"Este reloj se ve muy bien para trabajar a diario en la oficina, lo uso muy a menudo. El peso esta muy bien, las funciones son fáciles de usar, inclusive la alarma.Con-tras:- El muy difícil que trabaje bien el día, hace el cambio de día entre 10 y 11 AM.- Chronograph de solo 30 minutos.Conclusión: BBB (Bueno, Bonito y Barato)"
1,Not possible to get your foot in!,"I ordered a 9 wide. They arrived and were labeled a 9W but they were definitely not! I couldn't get my foot into the lacing part. Hoping they would fit a friend that wears 9 narrow, I asked her to try them on. She had the same issue. The netting part is too tight so its not possible to get your foot into the shoe. Very disappointing! Returning them for refund. I have another pair from this company that I love, but this is one I would definitely avoid.Also it looks silvery in the picture but its really black with silver specs. Still pretty...shame it wasn't wearable."
4,Great Sale,01/24/2011I am a value customer. I am greatly enjoying the Daniel Green Women's Slipper.My intention is to order more of Daniel Green Women's Slippers.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"Seller pulled a bait & switch, sent me a different, cheaper version of the pictured product. Never could get through when I called, slooow response time on e-mail. All in all my worst Amazon transaction in 5 years!!!!"
2,History or propaganda?,"This disjointed account of the long history of antagonism between the West and Islam attempts to support the politically correct but counterintuitive thesis that the West is less tolerant than the Muslim world. At the end the book disintegrates into a bitter denunciation of President Bush and others who support the use of force to combat Islamic terrorism, even comparing ""An End to Evil: How to Win the War on Terror"" by David Frum and Richard Perle to ""Malleus Malleficarum,"" a book credited with inspiring Medieval witch hunts that ""remains one of the most malign texts ever produced."" While not coherent or objective enough to stand up as history, ""Infidels"" might have propaganda value to some on the left."
3,A biased history,"This much needed history, misses the mark. The problem here is mostly that the book ignores all the islamic atrocities and anti-european sentiments among islamic scholarship while emphasising every inch of anti-muslim or intolerant writing done by Europeans. A heavily documented history of the anti-muslim manuscipts published in this book pretends to illustrate that it was Europe that was intolerant when in fact it was Islam that was on the offensive occupying Europe from 700AD through the 1800s. So how is it possible that it was all Europe that was intolerant when it was europe that was invaded, enslaved, persecuted and attacked for so long? THis book is simply biased, and loses the reader in hits intolerance.Seth J. Frantzman"
1,Incorrect geography,"A primary purpose of any globe is to at least depict countries which exist, and not draw new countries which do not even exist. This product fails on this simple part. Countries and their borders are drawn as per suiting fantasies of Chinese workers (where this product is made). Some huge mistakes (incomplete list):1. Kashmir is a country according this globe. (It is part of India according to UN.org or CIA factsheet on countries)2. Tibet is never mentioned3. Taiwan is part of China on globe.If you wish to teach your kids geography as is taught in China, this is an excellent buy. For a kid of a free democratic world, this a poor product.Another thing, irrespective of how much air you pressurize in this ball, it never attains shape close to a sphere.I would never buy replogle product again."
4,Good buy,"This is a great globe. It is an excellent learning tool.It is down right practical, too.It can be hung from the ceiling (for learning, or for storage).It takes a lot of punishment so kids can learn ""hands on"".If younger siblings get ahold of this, they can't break it or its stand like with the table top globes.It is a good investment."
3,Fun but country names hard to read,"My twenty-something son, who admittedly knows little about geography, was delighted to get this as a fun present. Now when we are talking about current events, we can refer to it instead of looking at each other blankly and saying, ""Where exactly is Libya?"" A globe is so much better at representing where countries are in relation to each other and how far away they are from us. (In Alaska, EVERYTHING is far away from us.) And a blow-up is perfect for someone who doesn't have a nice formal library with a grand piano for a big fancy globe to sit on. My only complaint is the city names jump out at you, because they are in black, but the more important country names are hard to see because they are written in different colors."
3,Smelled bad. Not very detailed. Lost air quickly.,"Eh,OK for a toy in general, if that's what you want.The plastic smelled very bad especially in the first several days.It inflated fine, but lost air fairly quickly over several days (in stationary indoor place).It is not nearly as detailed as a conventional globe quite smaller in size.Dee"
3,funny book but lacks some of its original comics,"When I was a child growing up in the 80's, I had bought the 1982 version of ""Kiss her, you blockhead!"". I must have read it 50 times! It was definitely a ""5 stars"". It was twice as big as this 90's version and had many more comics that included Snoopy as the flying ace and Linus' younger brother Rerun, as well as some other funny pages. Somewhere along the line I had misplaced the original book, so I recently bought another copy. Well I was dissapointed after reading it once to notice that there were many pages from the original book missing in this edition. I was wondering if anyone had an answer as to why some of those original comics would be omitted from this?"
3,The tool that comes with is gets blunt fast,I have had the battery for a few weeks now and it seems to be working fine. The tool is not very strong and gets blunt very fast.
1,"Easy install, but battery only lasted 6 months","Easy-to-follow instructions for installation. Unfortunately, battery died 6 months later... I bought this as a long term replacement, not as a quick fix. I recommend going with a different option."
1,Battery did not work,"I have bought this product and after following every single assembly step and let the battery plugged to be charged, it did not even start. Unfortunately, I have dispossed of my receipt thinking that all would be well; now I have a battery that is no good without a possibility of reimbursement.Be careful. I still hope that I could get one in a store rather than the net."
1,watch out,"If you buy anything from Sonnet, beware. There is no or little in terms of tech support. So don't screw it up. I tried to reach them, locally and no one answered the phone. 3pm on a weekday? They must have special work days."
2,Didn't hold charge,"Easy to install, but battery didn't really hold charge only about 30 min. Better off just by a new ipod"
2,Glad I hired this first,"This movie had been on my must watch list for ages, I highliy anticipated watching it but I'm sad to say I didnt really go on it and am so glad I hired this instead of buying it outright when it was first released. Seriously, WTF was this movie meant to be about? Part biker, part night of the living dead, part exorcist, part grindhouse, part ET - I could go on!! It had potential for sure, but didnt cut it in the end. On a positive note, I quite liked the people who played Cody, Megan & Shade, it's a shame they had to be in this mix up of a movie to get noticed. If they had left it as a fun grindhouse splatter movie it would have got more stars from me."
1,The worst of the worst.,"The only Sundance 2010 film I walked out of. A terrible attempt at a grindhouse film that intentionally rips off ""Blue Velvet"" and other films. The guy who introduced the film basically admitted the only reason it was accepted was the directors used to volunteer for the festival. A complete waste of time."
4,Lessons not learned?,"I picked up this title having read ""Young Men and Fire"" by this author's father. Both books detail tragic wildfires which each took the lives of multiple firefighters. ""Fire On the Mountain"" concerns the wrongly named South Canyon Fire in Colorado in 1994. The author provides background on the circumstances leading to the fire which was actually on the slopes of Storm King Mountain. A series of flawed decisions or decisions postponed along with a perfect storm of weather conditions led to a blowup of the fire and the race for life which followed. MacLean reconstructs events from survivors interviews and research of the official records. Well written."
5,Now I know.,"My husband has been a wildland firefighter since 1993. I have always known his chosen field is a dangerous one, and after reading Maclean's book, I thank God for every time he has made it home safely. The book is filled with accurate descriptions of what firefighters do. I know this, because I questioned my husband extensively after I finished the book. I recommend the book to anyone interested in the life of a wildland firefighter. But be prepared to cry and question the wisdom of some of those in charge. I really enjoyed this book!"
2,Hated it,"This is one of a very few books that I really did not like. I bought it because it was assigned to my nephew in his college class and I wanted to be able to discuss it with him, but the only thing we discussed was how bad it was. Maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea."
4,book,I have read this book several times and purchased this one as a gift for a friend. We had just hiked the storm king mountain trail and I wanted him to read the full story.
1,Resubtitle : One of the Versions of the Storm King Fire,"Gee -- this isnt the fire I remember fighting!! How eloquent and backbiting a report from someone who wasnt even there and who, while researching this book, appears to have devoted most of his time to the federal offices groups. To spend so much energy on the inability of politicos to get along when a fire is truly fought on the ground... And the truly amazing players, the local fire officers and firefighters who stepped up to the plate after the firestorm (prior to the arrival of the overhead team)and saved homes and each other -well, John you missed it, you missed most uplifting part of the story. So this isn't the ""true"" story of Storm King; it is one version, by someone who wasnt even there."
2,Some good investigating and but more to tell.,I was a very close friend of Don Mackey. I was however never interviewed for the book.There is more accurate imfo to tell about the story and Don that was never included. The lack of the writer to do a more indept study of the facts in a book of this nature is a real shame.It not only does not tell all the story but includes things that have no bearing or are incorrect. Getting the hole story not just what the immediate family wants you to know should have been his job.
5,I Couldn't Put This Book Down...,"This truly outstanding volume is a great read, as well as an example of investigative journalism at its absolute best.Maclean's research was exhaustive and he interviewed almost everyone connected with the Storm King Mountain tragedy. He then combines all this background material into one of the most compelling nonfictional narratives that I have ever read. This fine book would be an excellent book for journalists in training to study. Additionally, it is a lasting tribute to the smokejumpers and the Prineville hotshots who died."
5,A tribute and a warning.,"This is one of those books that not only tells a riveting story of the courage of those who have to do dangerous work, but also the price that they have to pay when there is incompetence in those who direct them. The incorrectly named South Canyon fire on Storm King Mountain ultimately cost the lives of 14 wildland firefighters and their story is well worth the time spent reading this book. The lives of the smokejumpers, the hot shots, and helitacks who died fighting the fire need no finer memorial than this book. It was obviously done by a man who respected them, their work and their courage. The brotherhood of those who share dangerous work is vividly portrayed and makes the loss seem all the greater. This is a very, very fine book. I would like to see it filmed, but I doubt even Hollywood could do it justice."
2,Switch Failure ?,"Purchased this in Jan 2011. Somewhat unwieldy but still usable. However, something failed in the light and so I assumed the bulb burned out. New bulb was sent me but it did not work either. So what next? I understand there has been a problem with the switch. I sent an email to Brinkman's customer service address from their web site but no response. Nothing is perfect but if Brinkman shows no interest in providing help to their customers then I certainly will avoid Brinkman products."
2,Bad Switch in Handle,Worked great about 1 week then it wouldn't turn on and I found the switch was bad already.. I tried to fix it but the switch is sealed and there is no way to try an repair it. Getting something different. The other thing that pissed me off was it quit at the time I really needed it.
5,excellent product works well what else can I say,"product as described-price is everything, works veey very very very very very very very very very very very very verywell"
2,my 3rd in 10 years,"I bought 2 of these in the past 10 years and they both performed great...my third I bought in October, 2012 and last week I tried to use it and it was barely on. Plugged in the charger and the little red light would not come on...left it over night and still nothing, but if I plug it into charger and try it I get that same tiny glow. I shall try to get it replaced or fixed and will give an update, but it may be time to go with a LED spotlight....i see some are getting rave reviews."
1,Total switch failure,"After purchasing two of these spotlights, I would have to recommend NOT to buy one! I had bought two of them for the purpose of checking livestock at night. The spotlight works great at first, but the switch fails after a few uses. This happened to both spotlights within a week of use. Unfortunately the switch is in the handle and unaccessible to try and fix. Not a good buy for the money!!"
2,switch failed after only a month,I bought this flashlight a little over a month ago and the switch has already failed. It was nice while it lasted but the housing and switch are way too flimsy and it was a waste of money.
5,Bright!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Got this for my husband for Christmas to replace the one million candle power light that quit. He uses it to check outside after dark when the dog goes bonkers about something........it's usually just wildlife. Shines a longggggggway. He's happy with it so far. Seems to be good quality.
1,Not a marine light despite misleading description,"Despite the description ""Keep it in your boat to sail through uncharted waters at night, bypass rocks, floating logs, etc. "", and the fact that it came up under a marine light search, when we got it it specifically states that it is only for dry land use application. I've bought a lot from Amazon, but was very disappointed that this product description was intentionally misleading"
4,General Physics Questions & Answers,"This book has the answers to many questions that you or your family may have about physics. Even if you do not have a specific question, just reading the book is both fun and educational. For example:Why is the Earth magnetized?What is the tallest building in the world?What do AM and FM mean and how do they differ?What is the longest bridge in the world?How does the human eye see?"
1,Embarrassing Errors,"This book is good for a young kid who wants to understand basic physics. However, this book contains some embarrassing errors. In the nuclear weapons section, the authors describes the first atomic bomb (the one that was detonated over Hiroshima) as ""Fat Man"" and the 2nd atomic bomb (another one that was dropped to Nagasaki) as ""Little Boy."" The author got it wrong. The truth is the 1st atomic bomb was ""Little Boy"" and the 2nd one ""Fat Man.""I wonder how many kids who read this book later somehow found the author's mistake.I just hope that other sections don't contain errors."
5,"Madness, Madness!!!",Excellent. What else can I write. Andrei Makine is one of the great writers of our time. As a reader you will descend into madness with the princess and feel as if you are holding her hand and can do nothing to stop it. An excellent addition to an already outstanding body of work. Highly recommended.
5,Raymond,My family enjoy going through all nine seasons of which we have now. We find it is really funny and sometimes an example of what not to do. Product arrived in good condition and on time.
5,whats not to love?,"I have all the seasons and theres nothing like sitting down on your favorite spot on the couch, grab a snack and turn on any episode from season 1 through 9. EXCELLENT ,FABULOUS, HISTERICAL, TALENTED CAST...I can go on and on...but I think you get the picture..Anyone who is familiar with this TV show has to appreciate the chemistry these acotrs have with one another. And being italian myself, there is so much to relate to.. I actually come from Lynbrook...(the town they live in ) so i get a kick out of hearing them mention my long island town. I highly recommend this DVD."
3,Fair,"I recieved the order in a timely order, they appeared to look in good condition.Their is skipping and distorted voice on some of the DVD's. I needed the last season to complete the set - here is a hint don't but the last episode alone it is here on this set."
2,Everybody Loves Raymond,I was very impressed by how quickly the item was shipped. The item was in excellant condition however the content was sorely lacking. I have all the seasons and the last season was an incomplete set. We were very disappointed that the last season's tape/disc was so short.
5,Works Like it Should,"I bought this and the razor that goes with it as a gift for my fiancee back when he was still in college. He's had the razor for over 2 years now and the blades got really really dull. Then, one day last week the charger randomly started sparking and smelling like smoke, so we just had to replace both. This charging station, however, still works like a charm. It's great to be able to have a super clean razor whenever he wants it, and I love how close the shave is when he uses it. However, I think his shaving habits may have something to do with the product's longevity--he only shaves maybe once or twice a week. A nice item, overall."
2,Braun Clean & Charger and Shaver - 8985 Activator - Don't buy!,"Yes, I do get a close shave and it's nice that it cleans itself, but if I were to do it again, I would never buy this shaver. It is too expensive to maintain. I've owned my 8985 Activator model for two years: the foil head and blades are supposed to last 18 months - I've had to buy three sets so far at $32.00 a piece! The clean & charge base just quit on me, another $50. Yes, it's a close shave (except for my neck), but at a high price."
3,Only 1200 feet!,"The cooking twine is fine but be aware that it contains only 1200 feet, not 2850 as stated on the product page. I needed 2850 feet and Amazon customer service immediately sent me a second roll, so kudos to them."
5,Exactly What We Needed,"My husband is an amazing cook. It's surprisingly difficult to find reasonably priced cooking twine. We were using my white embroidery string for a while there. :D The gourmet cooking stores seem to change a $20 premium for the privilege of shopping in their store. This cooking twine was excellently priced, and it holds up well to all types of cooking uses including broiling, baking, stews, etc."
5,Perfect for every level of cook,"Rated as the best on Americas Test Kitchen, this is perfect for all jobs in the kitchen and the best used with a trussing needle on all poultry. Super convenient and there is a lot on the cone so you do not have to worry about running out! go for it and cook like a pro."
2,Why on demand?,"I can't believe that a beloved show like FLIPPER is not worth producing a real restored DVD-edition and just ""on-demand"". Perhaps the first season from a few years ago didn't sell enough?"
1,Why Is This No Longer Available?,"As of December 12, 2010, the Amazon.com listing for this DVD says it is not currently available. If it is manufactured on demand, why is it no longer available? It looks like it was being purchased as recently as two weeks ago, yet now it is not available?"
3,glad i got 2nd season flipper,was satified with product but just a bit dissapointed that it didntcontain the list of episodes in the casing. and dont know if some parts of the show was cut out.
2,Way to much $.,"I want this, I have season 1. but why does it cost so much? Lower the price and you might sell a few."
3,Why wasn't it remastered and cleaned up?,"Enjoyed the program when originally aired. Season one was cleaned up,both audio and video. Season two showed a lot of inconsistencies in video, lots of scratches and dirt from second unit filming. You could see the difference between indoor and outdoor quality. Apparently the internegative used was of marginal quality. Apparently Season One had better quality negatives to work from and spent some time in restoration, at least digitally eliminating scratches and dirt. Technically, Season Two had a lot lacking."
1,Where is Amazon customer services!!!,"BUYERS OUTSIDE THE US. BEWARE!! Amazon will not ship this fabulous Flipper TV Season 2 outside the US.But why on earth do they not make that clear to international buyers. I ordered a copy 7 weeks ago and not even a curtesy of an email to explain why! especially to a loyal customer.The only reason why I am including this review is there is no way you can contact Amazon customer service on this website. I am really annoyed with Amazon.Flipper is a wonderful TV series that was shown worldwide. And there are a lot of people out there who wants to own their copy of Flipper Season 2. So please Amazon, take note."
4,Classic side scrolling game,"If you live in the 80s, you remember all the Nintendo side scrolling adventure games. Naruto Ninja Council pays homage to these classic games. It's play mechanic is retro with updated graphics. Boss battles are a bit hit and miss. Controls are simple but responsive. Bosses can be difficult to beat or a simple push-over, depending on what jutsu the software decides the boss character to perform. If you are a Naruto fan and likes retro Nintendoo games of the 80s. This is an excellent choice."
1,World's Worst Game!,"This game is a waste of money. Video games are meant to be a waste of time but this game is not worthy of being called a platform. I beat it in two hours with all of the availible characters. This is easier than the original mario brothers game and should just not be purchased. My ten year old brother did not enjoy it. The only tie in to the series? The cheesy graphics. The sound is tinny and is worse than the eighties games again. This game plays, looks, and feels like it was thrown together in five minutes."
2,"its alright, but if you want a good game get the sequel and.....","Skip the first, its a dissapointment but the second wont let you down i promise :)"
4,good book but...,"this book is very interesting and knowledgeable, the only downfall was that all the pictures were in black and white. i would have expected color pictures for the price tag put on this book."
5,very up-to-date info.,"Bought this book for my 11-year-old son, a big-time coaster enthusiast (though it wasn't written specifically for children). Very up-to-date information; would recommend this book. His only complaints: would have preferred color photos to the black-and-whites, and there is an error: a photo of Chang is incorrectly labeled as the Georgia Scorcher."
1,The tests are in!,"I've been taking this product for the past 6 months. I cut out a large portion of cheese, ice cream, and eggs from my diet. I was taking 2 pills of Policosanol a day and my total cholesterol went from 243 to 267. My HDL (good cholesterol) went down a smidge, but my LDL (bad cholesterol) shot up. I don't think the Policosanol had anything to do with the increase, but it sure didn't lower it at all. The only thing that went down was the balance in my bank account. Your results may vary, but do yourself (and your bank account) a favor and get a blood test relatively soon to see if it is working for you. It sure didn't for me and I'm sorry I didn't get it checked sooner to stop my subscription."
2,I expected more from a supposed Anime Legend.,"Silent Mobius is a story about a team of women that fight monsters. It's like a lame version of Bubblegum Crisis. The things I don't like about this anime are:1: The animation is bad. It's an older series, but the technology for way bTetter quality existed at the time.2: The story had a good initial idea, but was not carried out in an interesting manner.3: The characters. There were several characters with potential, but they weren't developed well enough to make you care about them.4: Bad voice acting. The characters didn't have any emotions visible in their speech.Adding all these flaws together I was very disappointed by this series. If you're still curious try watching it on youtube. Definitely don't buy w/o watching first. I'll give it 2 stars because there was some effort put into the story line. It was just executed very poorly."
3,A dirt cheap collection,"""2023. Beings known as ""Lucifer Hawk"" have begun invading the Earth from another dimension. All that stands between them and the enslavement of the human race is the Attacked Mystification Police Department, a special division of the Tokyo Police staffed by women with amazing paranormal abilities. Will the abilities of Katsumi Liqueur and these special women be enough to defeat these forces of darkness?""This collection consists of 6 DVDs for the entire series in a brick package."
2,A Bargain Price for a Boring Series,"It seems everyones happy about the price if this collection but they must not have watched it yet.To give a quick and simple review, this movie has 5 main character ""girls"" fighting demons. There are a few good episodes but there are so many inconsistencies and plot holes that it bothers me. There is a large lack of action in most of the episodes and some corny love stories that no one will enjoy."
2,Not a detailed guide as I had hoped,"So I was hoping this book would be a guide to help me implement procedures that work. However, it was not what I had thought. It does talk about strategies that work but does not go into detail how to implement these strategies and put them to use. This book is more like a review of strategies out there and their success. If you are looking for something that will help you set up strategies to help deal with managing a child's behavior, this is not the book to get."
1,Dissapointing,"I had bought this book after reading good reviews. I was quite dissapointed after I read it. The story was disjointed, and flat. The characters were shallow and unlikeable. Even the sex scenes were lacking in depth."
4,80% Accuracy,"This book is very interesting. It gives you detailed information about each zodiac sign as well as the Chinese astrology. This book seems to be 80% accurate on the zodiac signs. It describes your characteristic traits, personality, work, occupations, love, sex, your childhood, parenting, and which zodiac sign you get a long with and dont. The Chinese astrology chart is not that accurate...probably about 40% accurate. I recommend this book to anyone who is into the zodiac signs and the signs of their friends and family."
3,Cute Lil' Reference Guide,"I personally like this book because it blends both Chinese astrology and Modern astrology together. It is about four inches tall at best, about three inches wide and maybe two inches thick. It is great for carrying with you to work or on the subway to read. I also like how the authors have listed the common characterisitcs for kids, adults, males, females, parents, bosses, co-workers, employees...whoever you may come across in life. If you know a persons sun sign or even just a birthdate, you will find not onl a generalized decription of them, but also how they will tend to act and react in situations. Also, how to get them to bend. Now I wouldn't call it a must have, but it sure is a nice reference and ice breaker. I keep it with me at work and it never fails to catch someone's eye."
3,Latin Grammar,I am a beginnger and a certain level of knowledge is assumed in order to successfully navigate the pages of this book.
1,A warning: It uses the letter U instead of V,"If that drives you nuts as much as it does me, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. If he really wanted to be accurate, he should have eliminated spaces between words and written in all caps. Sorry Morwood, but lower case letters were ""never there"" either! Had he done so, however, it would have made his text almost uncomprehensible. It would have been better to stick to the standard rather than being so contrary.One other gripe is the end of the book is filled with EIGHTEEN blank pages... pages Morwood could have filled with useful grammatical notes..."
5,Stunning freshness and exquisite taste,"I don't honestly know how this album can get less than five stars. Solal's cover of ""End of a Love Affair"" swings as hard as Oscar, and his other tracks are great exploratory, thoroughly improvisational jazz. I can listen to this endlessly."
1,Bad Product!,"1: The outer tabs break off easily when connecting and disconnecting.2: not all connectors were threaded alike. some connectors threaded in easily, but others did not. I would have to use pliers to fully screw it in. This would destroy my coaxial cable. I found a 10 pack of quick connectors at 1/3 the cost. They work without any problem."
4,Gardening Shed on a Budget,This 3 shelf cabinet is awesome for my gardening supplies outside. It snaps together using no hardware and is made of heavy duty plastic. Since there is no hardware to rust I don't mind it being outside. It was easy to put together and holds so much for being only 3 shelves! A great buy!
5,Just what I needed!,"This cabinet is roomy, sturdy, and pops together with very little time and effort. I am not very mechanically inclined, and it still took me under 15 minutes. The original one I received as a gift and it shipped with a broken part, but exchanging it was simple as could be and fast too! My apartment has very little storage room, and I needed a place to stow my extra pots and pans and assorted things that don't have a spot elsewhere. This has the capacity to hold off of these things and more. A great option for anyone who wants to expand their storage space!"
5,Suncast storage cabinet,"Great cabinet....easy to assemble, with lots of space. The door lock, which is an added plus."
3,Don't expect too much and you'll be OK,"The plastic was slightly more flimsy than I expected, so even though it assembled in under ten minutes, there were places where things did not seal as tightly as one might like. It will certainly do the job I want it to do, and the price was right compared with other, similar items. If you are thinking of buying the tall version of this, I would think twice. But if you just want it for light storage duty, it's perfectly adequate."
3,A flimsy but useful cabinet,"I bought two of them. Once assembled, the cabinets are flimsy but useful if you take care with loading and unloading items. The front door on one of them is poorly fitted but works. The bottom shelf also slips out of it slot under heavy load. The other fits fine. The cabinet is made of plastic with not a lot of structural strength. My original plan was to stack them one on the other but I'm not going to now that I've seen the completed cabinet. Assembly is moderately easy, the only complication being the installation of shelves into flimsy support slots."
5,Perfect!,"Our house(on stilts)received very little damage when Hurricane Ike hit Galveston, TX. We did get 4-1/2 to 5"" of water in our garage area that destroyed the pre-fab cabinet placed when the house was built.The Suncast C3600G Utility Storage Base Cabinet is the PERFECT replacement, both price-wise and space-wise. It is an extremely well-made and sturdy unit and it ""went together"" easily!"
5,Good Value,The product does everything it claims. Very easy to put together. Medium quality materials.It will hold up well as long as its not overloaded.(Same as any shelving product)Very Satisfied.
5,Great!,This was very easy to put together. I really think this product would work well for anyone looking for storage solutions. I am using in my garage and love it.
2,doesn't work,It was just what my husband wanted but does not work so we will be returning it. Very annoying. We'll find another elsewhere.
5,Totally surprised by great taste!,"My family and my healthfood store lady all say this is one of the best of Betty Lou's Nut Butter Balls. I do not have any problems at all with the taste, in fact, it beats the heck out of the coconut ones which are extremely sweet. Yes, they look green in the middle, but we found the taste rather ""clean"" and refreshing...not overbearing.You will also enjoy the ""lift"" in your energy level these spirulina/ginseng balls provide. Now that I know about these little guys, I am getting ready to buy TONS for Christmas gifts! We would not be without them anymore. :-)"
3,Mixed review,"I gave this product 3 stars because of the magnificent nutritional content and the easy portability. I did not give it four or five stars because this product looks like and tastes like something that was scooped out of the kitty litter box. While that seems disgusting, these SG Balls are so similar, I cannot get that thought out of my head while I am eating them. I am just hoping that I will gradually grow to like the flavor and the look....Great Nutrition, terrible taste in my opinion."
1,"Too ""Green"" For My Taste","You have to really like Spirulina to enjoy these. The entire center is ""green"". Too strong for my taste. Try the Almond Butter balls, they are delicious!"
1,Its wrong,This ad says two episodes. And all I received was one. if you look on the ad it says two great movies. what I received was only one this was vary deceiving
5,Wraps up the trilogy,Just an enjoyable wrap up to the trilogy that answers a lot of the questions from the first two books. The entire trilogy reads easily and keeps your interest. The basic plot is that Mark Chaos (Odysseus) discovers who has been pulling the strings that caused the beast war and leads the battle to destroy Heljanita the toymaker.
1,Duped!,"Unlike the previous customer review, I stuck this thing out to the end. I wasted my time. I bought it bbecause it was purported to be about the Lake District in WWII, but it was hardly that. I've been to the Enlish Lake District many times, though I doubt Mr. Busch EVER has. He captures none of its Wordsworthian beauty. The back of the jacket has praise from people nobody's ever heard of, or certainly I haven't. Worse there is a picture of the author on the rear flap. Very smug, it seems to shout at the reader ""Gotcha to pay money for this, didn't I?"" The book is a mess, transitions absent, characters self-pitying, scenes wailing. I've read Mr. Busch before and liked him. Doubt, after this one, I ever will again. It was just an awful experience, esp. when my reading time is precious to me. JKC"
1,Difficult to get into,"I had a difficult time getting into, following, making sense of this book. I gave up on it at page 35. It was very disjointed, rather like the protagonist's mind, I suppose, but I couldn't follow it and lost interest.I did not want to rate the book since I did not finish it, but I have to give it something or my entry is not accepted, so I'll give it a 1 star. But keep in mind that I didn't read the entire book."
4,Memories & cost-saving recipes,"My mother used a much more beat-up copy of this cookbook. You can bake, boil and stew your way back through memory lane with some of these recipes. I don't think any of them will win culinary awards, but for baby-boomers it's likely to make you nostalgic. ;-)"
1,you have the wrong date listed,"I have the first 10 Household Searchlight recipe books ever printed. 1931 was the first year this wonderful book was printed but you have yours listed as a 1931 version. they changed the cover to the one you have sometime after the 1940 one.you need to re-list this issue of yours as a ""copyright 1931,1937""etc. and list the correct date of issue which would normally be found on the inside cover page.(provided it's still in tact). perhaps you werent aware of these facts but they are easily researched.(Google,Ask etc.)Hope this info helps, sincerely, Avid Searchlight collector, T. Verstuyft"
4,The Household Searchlight Recipe Book,"Being an older book, the recipe book was in good condition other than some marks from age and use. It was what I had wanted so am happy with it."
4,Highly motivating!,"A great book - full of insightful suggestions to change your life for the better. If you can get by the corny story line and cheesy dialouge, you'll find many ways to lead a more fulfilling and less stressful life. I've read it twice!"
3,Ok but not quite right...,"I have to say that the foundation of what this book is based upon is quite solid and it is a tried and tested formula that appeals and appears to work for people. I think that is great!I did find the writing a little forced and a bit 'gee-golly-whizz' at times - but you get over that too. This is where we wish we could find ourselves between Paulo Coehlo and Kahlil Gibrain's 'The Prophet'. It's similar territory and useful information - but the packaging was not to my personal taste. That said, I am quite sure that many people will get a LOT of good out of this book. I know I will, despite my niggling dislikes about the delivery. I know it needs to be simple and easy to digest, but it was a little patronizing at times in its use of language.As I said before and will say again, however, the message is a good one. So if you can overcome stilted prose you are onto a life-changing aid..."
3,The worst Writer in the world,"OK, I admit, its a great story, and the concepts - peace, self-improvement, balance - in the form Mr. Sharma has chosen to present them, are important. This book could change your life for the better.BUT this guy is, really, the Worst Writer in the World. I found myself laughing out loud several times in the first 20 pages - and nothing there was meant to be funny. If you are in to great writing, please, read McMurtry, Irving, almost anyone else. You will barely be able to skim this book, because the writing is quite literally so bad it interferes with the ride."
1,Very poorly written,There are some good ideas here but none are original. It is just a rehash of the stuff that has been known for centuries. The story is very lame and the author's writing style and use of the language is so poor that it makes this book unreadable.
5,Best game plan to balance and make life fulfilling,This book will get you back on track in your life. It will help your soul find your purpose.Read it two times
4,Fulfilling your dreams,This book was referred to me by a close friend/relative. Very good book. Makes you rethink life and what you are doing w your own life. Recommend it.
1,Not well researched.,This book was remarkably missing the main points of Buddhism. I was disappointed. It was a self improvment book with no real wisdom to share about how to accomplish all the tasks that were set out.
3,Could have been much better,Did not like the way in which the information was presented. The background story added little to the message of the book and in fact was more of a distraction than an aid to reinforcing the main purpose of the book.
2,Nice enough ideas. Very poorly written,"A friend recommended it and I just can't get through it. Nice enough philosophy, but it reads like it was written by high school sophomore C English student. Some of it is so bad I'm embarrassed for the author and put it down for a week or a month."
3,I can understand why people love it or hate it,"If a book is full of wisdom, but in the form of a cheesy story packed with lots of cliches ... then is it a good book or not?This is the issue I wrestled with in reading the Ferrari-less Monk. Much of the time I was cringing (""world class litigator"" etc) ... and yet every few pages I found a delicious thought, mostly quotes from other sources, that made me glad I had perservered.So, although I can understand why other reviewers seems to hate it, or love it ... I think it falls somewhere in-between.If you haven't bought it yet, there are plenty of other books that do a better job (Siddhartha, The Alchemist etc). However, if you've got a copy on your desk and are wondering whether or not to read it ... I'd suggest you only speed-read the crappy narrative and focus on the ideas and quotes instead!"
1,The monk who sold his Ferrari to Mr. Sharma,"The norwegian translation of this book states on the sleeve: The eternal wisdom presented in a completely new way.Nothing could be further from the truth: Mr. Sharma seems to have made a porridge of the most easily digestible versions of eternal wisdom and the most glib and superficial versions of self-help books on the market, and put whatever rose to the surface in a ""fable"" strangely lacking in any form of drama or power to transform or inspire.I admire those who can find upliftment in this flat copy of others` ideas, but rereading ""Autobiography of a yogi"" and reading Malcolm Gladwell`s ""Blink"" around the same time as I had the misfortune to encounter this book, the difference in quality is staggering.Puzzled, I looked up Mr. Sharmas home page, and found the most blatant piece of commercialism and grandiose self-advertisement in the self-help field - no mean feat in a field of strong and heavy competition.It`s obvious who bought the monk`s Ferrari."
2,dreadful,"Julian works himself to a heart attack, goes to Himalayas, comes back in robes with a ""supple skin"", and starts lecturing on how to improve life.I could not relate to the fable. The author's writing style is too synthetic. I'd any day recommend The Alchemist."
2,I was very disappointed.,"Unique, yes. But rhetorical and cliche, too. Example: What do you want more than anything in life? When you know the answer, focus your mind on getting there. Sure, that's easy for a monk to say. What else is he going to do in the Himalayan Mountains?"
2,Disappointing!,"The basic ideas in this book are worthy, but it is so awkwardly written it is painful. I finally just had to put it down. Maybe it just boils down to the fact that books of this type either ""speak to you"" or they don't. This one spoke to me, but what it said was ""you wasted your money on contrived tripe."""
5,A must read for anyone who needs enlightment,"Usually ""I don't have the time"" is a phrase we commonly use when we come to a point where we're overwhelmed with work, meetings, study, etc.What this book essentially gives you is the way for you to become a better person from the inside to the outside, and helping you make time to do this.- ""Know yourself"", then you'll be able and have the willpower to change everything and anything you want in this life.- ""Master your mind"" and ""Master your time"" and take control of everyhting, so that abundance and happiness will always be in your life and in the life of those around you."
5,Great read!,"I love this book. It in some ways changed my life. Sounds cheesy, but it's true. The messages in it are so true and Robin Sharma makes it so simple to make small changes in your daily life to help relieve stress, look towards a better future, and reach your potential in any area of life. I think it will make me a better wife, mother, and help me with my career. I bought it so I can reread it over and over. Just amazing!JeanMoms Helping Moms Work From Home[...]"
3,An odd blend...,"I enjoyed this book, with reservations. It's an odd blend of (mostly) Buddhist philosophy with the sort of self-help pep talk preferred by corporate go-getters. At times it reminded me of reading the Dalai Lama, at others, a Franklin-Covey leadership session.The parable is a little facile, and the dialog naive-- but the overall thrust benign and even helpful. It may well be a doorway to a better path for many who read it. If you've never encountered Eastern philosophy before but are already a fan of corporate pep talks, you may find this a real treat."
2,As many books...,"As many books of this kind, the writer thinks that because he made something and he has some advantage of what he did, everybody has to do the same to have a better life. I think that only a very few people would change everything they have to find the spiritual peace. Albeit what is written in the book could be written with some wisdom I don't think that anybody will do exactly as the book says."
2,"Some good advice, but much too mystical","Some of the advice he gives is sound, but he makes it all sound so mystical. For example, the ""Heart of the Rose"" exercise is meditation. There, simple and precise; no need to get a rose and stare at it, learn about meditation instead, not some mystical, over-specific prescription.Other concepts, like kaizen, were interesting, but didn't talk enough about the philosophy of the idea.All in all, the concepts expressed in the book seem to all come from some non-existant religious sect, rather than from the author's life. I know that the ideas are expressed in a story to make them more easily absorbed, but the effect seems to obscure the real potential of some of the concepts in the book."
1,"Corny, without substance, and painfully predictable","""The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari"" is a mish-mash of a rudimentary self-help principles, wound into a ""fable"" that goes nowhere. The writing style is cheesy, and the 'wisdom of the sages' that Sharma tries to pass off is corny, without substance, painfully predictable, and in certain places, plagiarised.If you're looking for real tools for self improvement and motivation, you'd be better off looking up the author of a plagiarised phrase that appears on the back cover ""...live with passion..."" (Anthony Robbins)."
1,Time better spent elsewhere,"Another author that tries to enlighten others by weaving his teachings into an incredibly shallow story. I felt the same way about The Celestine Prophesy. The Alchemist was better, and The Way of the Peaceful Warrior was the best in this genre. There are lots of wonderful and intelligent books out there for spiritual growth. This is maybe one for someone who's just getting their feet wet."
3,mETAPHYSICAL,"tHIS BOOK IS WELL WRITTEN, HOWEVER, IT IS PRESENTING METAPHYSICAL PRINCIPALS IN AN EASTERN CONTEXT. BECAUSE OF THIS I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED, HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE NEW TO METAPHYSICAL PRINCIPALS, IT CAN BE INFORMATIVE,"
1,Disappointed ..,"The book was recommended to me by a friend. I was really disappointed, no doubt the book have some good messages, but it has been dragged unnecessarily. Will not recommend to anyone."
3,The monk who sold his ferrai,"This is an ""ok"" self-help type of book. You learn the same lessons about ""slowing down and smelling the flowers"" which is the typical recommendation of a high-powered business type or lawyer who has a scare (heart attack etc).A decent read with a tale that all of us should hear from time to time- then we go right back to normal after a frustrating drive home!"
1,is the Ferrari still for sale?,"Trips to India and enlightenment and all that jazz are fine and dandy, but I could use a new car. Is the Ferrari still for sale? Or any of his other stuff?"
5,How to be successful Spiritually and Career wise!,"This book is a good story that teaches the fundamentals of how to be successful Spiritually and Career wise!I've read of 40 self-help books in the last three years, and this book is by far my favorite.Enjoy.Warmly,JP Richards"
1,the monk who sold his ferrari,Unfortunately the book has not arrived... It was for January the 11th but I'm still waiting...It's an excellent book though.
5,The Monk Who sold his Ferrari,"Robin Sharma's this book is most amazing and useful book i have ever read. This book can change your life and teach you how to live happily. Thank you Robin. Sincerely,Kate"
5,Terrific Help,"I happened to notice this book at our library due to its unusual title --' The Monk who sold his Ferrari'. To my utter surprise, I discovered after reading a few chapters that it was a real gem of a book.So I recommend the book wholeheartedly for any person .. young or old .. who is motivated in finding 'true' meaning in their lives.Also given the abstractness of topics covered here, I must say the story telling of Sharma makes it very easy to grasp for the average reader. I disagree with many of the early reviewers on this note.Based on this experience, I will now look out for other books from Robin Sharma."
4,Well Written and Informative,"Sharma's book is definitely well written and a very easy and enjoyable read. It highlights wisdom from the EAST and WEST in a succint manner. Its certainly worthwhile and will help you to transform your life if applied with persistence and determination. It discusses principles such as mastering the garden of your mind, positive thinking, following your purpose, inner development, building and applying discipline, making good use of your time, helping humanity, and above all living in the moment. Im sure you will enjoy the book and I definitely recommend it. I believe there is wisdom to be found in all works of written art, however you must apply the knowledge to your life. Highly recommended."
3,Good if you are new to Buddhism,"The book is well written. When Julian Mantle suffers a heart attack, he goes to India to learn from some wise Buddhist men over there.There are other books that talk about eastern philosophy that are much better than this one, because they concentrate on that philosophy and their principles.The techniques described here are not new at all. But if you are new to Buddhism and eastern philosophy, then this book should be ok for a start. And of course, the book views eastern philosophy from a western point of view (which some of you may like).The main part of the book is when Julian Mantle comes back of India and sees an old friend, and then Julian starts to explain all the wisdom that he learned in India."
4,Simple Thoughts on Self Improvement,"Sharma uses a fable (involving a garden, a lighthouse and a sumo wrestler-to name a few) to describe the ""seven virtues"" and easy to use techniques for self improvement. Everything is readily understandable and feasible. Of course, the trick is to implement the techniques in your own life. :-) Unfortunately...the author can't do that for you!"
1,Chicken Soup for the Millionaire Soul,"Unfortunately, I WASTED my hard earned money on this one. I expected a story in the same realm as Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist, because that was the way it was marketed in my bookstore. However, what I found was a trite and shallow narrative about how a multi-millionaire found peace and harmony in India. Throughout the entire book I kept laughing to myself, shaking my head and thinking, ""of course this guy found inner-peace, I would too if I had a few million dollars in the bank back home and went on a extended holiday to India."" Nice try Robin S. Sharma, I didn't buy into your make-believe world. My recommendation: For all you billionaires out there, you might find a small bit of inspiration in this book. For the rest of us save, your money or better yet, buy another up-lifting book that will actually move you to reach for your dreams. I highly recommend The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho."
1,Zen and the art of rehashing,"I must confess ... I had significant expectations after I heard so much about it.All through, the author, Robin Sharma, borrows freely from every Indian, Chinese and Western philosopher/self-help author ... its like throwing in 20 delicious fruits and vegetables into a mixer, whipping it into shreds, boiling and cooling the resulting concoction and trying to drink it as quickly as possible ... what happens? You end up throwing up ... thats what this book is ... its a painful regurgitation.Im amazed he found a publisher!I suggest you steer clear of this book if you dont want to be sick ... I now have second thoughts on Paolo Coelho after he wrote a tribute to this book!!!However if you are completely inert on philosophy and have never done any introspection ever, this may be a good start. However I dont know if this is available in 'android print'."
2,Like It & Dislike It,"I appreciate the underlying wisdom 'The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari' tries to articulate - develop joyful thoughts, follow our life's mission & calling, cultivate self-discipline, nourish relationship etc. On the other hand, I am disappointed by Sharma's inferior writing; the dialogue between a high profile trial lawyer & his protoge seems unrealistic & superficial, & the characters are difficult for readers to relate to.For readers who are interested in learning more about the wisdom that 'The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari' fails to articulate, I would recommend Alan Wallace's 'Genuine Happiness', and Matthieu Ricard's 'The Quantum & The Lotus'."
5,Good book - worth reading,"I can understand the negative reviews of this book...but...I knew nothing of eastern philosophy before I read this book and now this book has made me aware of an area of knowledge that will probably become central in my life. It's a very simple book but at this stage in my life it is exactly what I needed. I don't think the book is profound but it is a stepping stone onto things that are. Give the book a try and you may find that it is the wake-up call that you need too. If you even think about buying this book, then you should, it means that you're at a point in your life where you're looking for answers or meaning. This book will point you in a good and meaningful direction."
4,"Clean family flick, worth watching once","No foul words, alright plot, good characters, pretty good acting, clean all around. Bit of a love story. No real morals taught. Fun clean family flick"
4,Interesting movie,I love westerns and this is an interesting addition to my library. Not much to say about it in a review except it is enjoyable. Sam Elliot always has entertaining and unusual movies.
5,"The Ranger, The Cook and The Hole in the Sky",Depression era story about the clearing of mountain roads in Idaho using a crew of men under the supervision of Ranger Bill Bell. The bravado of a young man along with his dislike for the cook (card shark) create a smouldering conflict. A pretty young city girl is the romantic interest of the young man. The Ranger steers his crew through a plan to get even with the city's cheating gamblers that demands a troubled partnership between the young man and the card shark cook. The exciting plan plays out in a solution that is unexpected. Fun movie to watch with beautiful background scenery. I bought the movie after seeing it on TV. I continue to enjoy watching it about every month.
3,More 'Hole' than expected.,"The 'Mac' depicted here was far too silly to have grown into the Norman Maclean of ""A River Runs Through It"". Otherwise a good adaptation of the Maclean novella"
3,So So!,Sam Elliott is one of my favorite actors but this movie is short on substance and even shorter on Sam Elliott.
3,wholesome family,I enjoyed this film because it was family friendly and presented good ethics in personal responsibility.
2,Enough is enough,"When Nelly released his single ""Hot in Herre"" a few years ago, I found it pretty interesting that he not only chose to add a ""southern slang"" accent onto the word ""here,"" but also chose to spell it in his own way. I'll admit that hearing this song repeatedly over the airwaves during this time period quickly became an annoyance, but with time, I got over it. Nelly is again tolerable, not preferred, but tolerable.That's more or less all I have to say for this review. Chingy's single ""Right Thurr"" is a blatant rehash of Nelly's ""Hot in Herre"" single, no matter which way you slice it. Same ""catchy"" southern slang accent, same lyrical subject matter, same beat construction. The only real difference lies in the vocal delivery and lyrical style, and sadly to say; Chingy loses to Nelly on both of these fronts. I don't even like Nelly in the least, so this is saying a lot!First impressions mean a lot, and my first impression of Chingy is this very song. Obviously not a very good one."
1,Hurr Is Some Really Bad Rap,"Just because Chingy is from St. Louis dosent mean that he needs to copy the whole style of Nelly and the St. Lunatics. But thats not the real problem here. The problem is that this song is bad...real bad. I really like rap and will tolerate most of the poppy dance stuff,but this is terrible and the lyrics have already been heard many times on many other songs. Dont buy or even download this...it isnt worth your time at all. There is better rap elsewhere."
1,what the hell is this?,Chingy is suppose to be a bad rapper cause he sucks but in this song he just crossed the line! This is crap! This is NOT REAL RAP! I wouldn't even like to waste a penny on this so called Chingy! I downloaded this song because i heard a lot about it and Chingy! But i m never gonna give Chingy another chance! HE SUCKS!
2,I didn't know Nelly had a brother,"...But seriously, this song is really uninteresting. It sounds like a St. Lunatics throwaway, which is bad on so many levels. If you're looking for good rap, check out...well, pretty much anything else.Anthony Rupert"
5,STOP HATIN,"Yall need ta stop hatin on chingy cuz Right Thurr is the best, and hes made 2 remixes out of it! And they are stillplayin on the east coast radio so yall need ta stop hatin on him!"
1,Careful what you buy!,"It doesn't say it clearly, but the Vornholt/Kindle version is the youth adaptation and crap. The Dillard version does not seem to be available for the Kindle. Not happy - wish I could get my money back."
1,Another churned-out novelization,"This is another novelization of a Star Trek movie. These are written under notoriously tight deadlines and are usually an inferior experience to just reading the script online.The inital draft of the First Contact screenplay contained large sections that didn't make the final cut. Although some of the first draft was wildly incompatible with the final screenplay, much of it just required reshuffling the sequence of events. Picard originally had a whole subplot to himself, involving some romance with an original female character while also trying to conceal the wounded Cochrane from a military thug.Trek novelizations are always about 120 pages of material stretched to fit the required hardcover page count, so all these unused pages of script should have been a godsend, but someone (probably not the author) decided to limit the book to what wsa onscreen and nothing more. This book is no more than a padded version of the final script."
3,great for 6th grade,If you are a sixth grader or have a sixth grader that you want to develop great study habits this is a great book for you. There are very few technical tips about taking standardized tests. The book is for developing great study habits to prepare for taking tests. If the reader is much older than junior high age his or her study habits are probably too ingrained to change very much and this book is not worth buying.
2,"It's a very cute premise, but it's not perfect.","Who could resist seeing their dog pick this smile up in their mouth and run around with it? Adorable, right? Well, it would be if it ever happened. My dog, at least, has not once picked it up by the correct spot in order to give her the rubber dog lips smile. When she does play with it (which is few and far between since she really only likes squeaky toys) she just gnaws on the end or the nose. So, it's a worthwhile chew toy, as it's one of the few she hasn't destroyed...but your mileage may vary if you're buying this to get some cute pics of your dog with rubber lips."
3,Could have been better,"This is an attempt to recreate (in spirit if not exact tracklisting) a nearly-released 1972 Elvis LP ""Standing Room Only"". And it's nearly a great job. It collects together all of Elvis's '72 studio masters for the first time, plus a good selection of stuff from a February '72 stint in Las Vegas. Unfortunately all but 3 tracks can be found on the ""Walk A Mile In My Shoes"" box and the compilers have drafted in two 1971 cuts (which kinda spoils the concept) and guess what? Yeah, they're on the 'Shoes' box too. If they'd hunted out a few more live '72 tracks and left off the two '71 cuts, I'd haven given this CD 5 stars for the concept alone, because there never was a genuine 1972 LP except the Madison Square Garden concert until now - but fans who've bought the 'Shoes' box will find it hard to splash out more dollars for 3 songs."
3,For Elvis Completists,"RCA/BMG's ""Burning Love"" compilation is a telling example of how erratic Elvis Presley's music had become in 1972. Though the CD includes a few classic songs, it also has some forgettable tracks such as ""It's a Matter of Time"" and ""Fool."" With the exception of ""Burning Love"" and ""I'm Leavin,"" most of the studio recordings from 1971-72 do not feature Elvis at his best. As a whole, the 1973 studio sessions at Stax are far superior to the material on ""Burning Love."" Nevertheless, it's an improvement over the 1972 budget album - and the live performances are a welcome addition."
3,"1.5"" Ateco Pastry Brush",This pastry brush looks exactly like the picture and it is a decent value. My worry with this is how long the bristles will last. When I washed it for the first time some of the bristles came out.
2,If You Eat Bristles,You might like this brush if you like bristles. My first use on my beautiful Thanksgiving turkey left it with bristles that I had to pick off.
1,TWEETER DUD!,"RECEIVED THE PRODUCT, A WEEK WENT TO HAVE THEM INSTALLED, AND NOTHING! JUST A FAINT HUMMING SOUND! THEY DON'T WORK!!! I WAS SOLELY DISAPPOINTED IN THE PRODUCT!"
4,November Energy,"Cuneiform keeps uncovering rare British big band jazz, and each one is a discovery. Harry Miller's Isipingo was an offshoot of Chris McGregor's Brotherhood of Breath, and like BoB is mostly an excuse for a blow-off. Four extended (14-20 minute) pieces with minimal heads and tails and a lot of bloozy woozy soloing in between. Through it all Miller's standup bass keeps up a steady barrage of staccato notes. The largely-freeform result is maybe closer to Centipede than to Nucleus or Neil Ardley.This 11/20/75 live recording by Radio Bremen is excellent as usual, with lovely pickup of a number of soloists, not easy to do with a live band onstage."
4,"Lots of fun, a pity it's out of print.","My teachers always told me that there's no such thing as a perfect score, that't why the 8 instead of a 9. Greenberg's book has a title like a self-help manual. Its content will amuse, arouse and give pause for thought. Greenberg's sense of the ridiculous approaches John Irving's and his mix of characters is hilarious. Well worth reading, and rereading."
4,Leanne Banks' Story a Standout!,"""Faith's Sugar-Plum Daddy,"" a novella by fan-favorite Leanne Banks, is the highlight of this anthology. ""Home For the Holiday"" offers three stories of sisters who return for a Holiday reunion to a small Texas town. The heroines are appealing and the heroes, sexy. This a great Holiday treat for a cold, winter night!"
4,I Give The First Story 5 Stars & The Last Story More Than 5,"When I read the first story ""Faith's Surgar Plum Daddy, by Leanne Banks, I could feel the chemistry between the characters Faith and Gabriel Raines, after reading this book I kept thinking about these two and Faith's kids great read, the second book was OK, in this story I did not feel the Chemistry with the characters in this one, Ann Elise and Joe, he did not to anything for me. Now I must say the last story did it from me, I loved it so much more than the first story and that is saying a lot because I loved that one. Talking about Chemisty these to have it, oh everytime Tate would call Marilou darlin, I had to stop for a moment and take it all in, in this book they have Gabriel and Joe, It was good to have Gabrel in this book, oh what a enjobable read :)"
5,Leanne's Story was my Favorite,Again Leanne Banks does a wonderful job of telling a heartwarming story. I love this author!
1,"high on potential, low on result","I love to visit retailers, especially the ones with innovative concepts, or the ones undergoing change. Trader Joe's is one of the innovators in the industry, and I was delighted to see a book written about their philosophy and strategy.Now the unfortunate thing about this book is that this book could have been summarized on 1 or 2 pages. Unless you have Alzheimer's, it's really not worth continuing to read after page 20, as the book will repeat itself time after time.The book was not very revealing, and easily one to miss without feeling you missed something."
1,No insights and too rah-rah,"I really wanted to find out more about Trader Joe's. This book gives only the surface details. Most of the book read like a lazy magazine article, with no real insight into the story behind the press release. I was also bothered by the Trader Joe's can do no wrong attitude. I learned nothing; I stopped reading."
1,Poorly Written Book on an Interesting Subject,"Being that I enjoy Trader Joe's and the unique concepts behind it that have made it so successful, I was excited to read this book. Unfortunately, I only made it about 100 pages into this book and then I had to just put it down. I was getting so sick of the same repetitive statements and sentences and kept waiting for the real information and ""meat"" to turn up. But it never did...only simple statements, with not much to back them up. It was like reading the back cover of the book over and over and over and over. Not worth your time, money, or energy. Go to a Trader Joe's in person and you'll gain far more info than you will reading this book."
2,An exercise in hyperbole and repitition,"Len Lewis took on an exciting task by attempting to write about Trader Joe's, one of my favorite stores. However, probably due to his lack of material, the book has little substance. Lewis' writing is full of hyperbole, which doesn't belong in an inside look at a business. In addition, as other reviewers have stated, the same few facts are repeated over and over again. I appreciate the effort here, as those few facts happen to be interesting, but I'm not sure why the same material wasn't released as a single chapter in some other book."
1,Shopping at Trader Joe's and guessing is not research,"Luckily I borrowed this from the library and didn't buy it. Basically, the author is an expert on grocery stores, so he comments on how Trader Joe's is different and makes a lot of assumptions about how happy everyone that works there is. I think the quality of the book would have been doubled if he managed to score an interview with a former hourly employee. You will learn nothing about Trader Joe's from this book that you couldn't guess yourself by shopping there."
5,ritual practice,"This book is about the 14 trainings. It contains the actual ritual practices for achieving mindfulness. Thich Nhat Hanh discusses ""The Order of Interbeing"" as a community for ""Engaged Buddhism"". This book was recommended to me by a monk from Deer Park Monastery in California. He thought of it as a way towards becoming a Budhisattva."
5,Why so rare?,"I love this stuff, wonder why it is so hard to find? Often out of stock, nearly impossible to find in stores. Maybe not for everyone, but I love the sweet, slightly malty taste."
1,Run From This Book Screaming,"I am using this book as a text in a college class. I rated it at one star because there was no lower rating. The T-SQL syntax is wrong more often than not, and this makes utilizing this book more difficult than it should be; the T-SQL examples are so poor as to be considered useless.In addition to T-SQL syntax errors, there are plain English errors as well. I am nearing the end of the class where this book was used as a text, and in retrospect it appears that it has not been edited at all.I would expect the editing quality from a company with Sybex's reputation to be more thorough than it is.If you pass this exam and have writing skills, perhaps you should apply to Sybex as a technical editor; it appears as though they could use the help."
4,Good to start!,This book is a good overview if you need to learn basic SQL Server skills. There are a few exercises to help with some sections. This book is easy to read and understand. But you can't pass the exam if you only read this book. The book lacks the depth necessary to pass the exam.
3,Bolts are shorter than OEM,"Tried to use this Walker bolt sit to install a Walker muffler for a 1990 Integra RS (MT). Used an impact wrench to remove the old bolts without damage (use penetrating oil on threads). The nuts were welded to the B pipe flange. Noticed that the new bolts were 1/2"" shorter than the OEM bolts.When I went to reassemble the flex connection, the 2 new bolts, I couldn't get them to reach the nuts without compressing the spring (an impossible job). I reused the old bolts and it was simple to reassemble."
2,needed modification,The diameter of these bolts were too big for the holes they were supposed to go into. In order to make them fit it took a lot of struggling and I had to grind the diameter of the bolt down. Getting them out again is going to be pretty tough but hopefully that will be someone else's job.
5,Walker Exhaust 35129 spring bolt kit,"Good product, fit well. Good price and quality of the bolts are good. I would recommend this product to anyone."
3,Application guide lies,"Amazon listed this hardware kit as compatible with my 2007 Subaru Outback 2.5 SOHC. While it does fit, I had to place some washers on the spring side to achieve proper tension. The unthreaded portion is the same diameter as the factory bolt, but longer. The threaded portion is smaller diameter than the factory bolt, but comes with matching nut."
5,Well made shirt.,The shirt is well made and the embroidered logo is nicely done. High quality shirt.
5,A Change of Pace,"Those who know her best from her work with Bel Canto will appreciate the structure of the songs on this album. While it certainly leans toward pop rather than the ethereal goth/spiritual tones of Bel Canto, her voice still resonates beautifully. She's having fun on her own without sacrificing musicality. This is certainly a change of pace, but the pace is pleasing."
5,Superb,"This is the best musick I ever heard.Anneli's beautiful voice ,newer a boring moment . The record is to short . It could last longer ."
1,Chilton 1990 Caddy repair manual,"If you buy this book like I did because you want to make relatively simple (but potentially very expensive) repairs yourself, say like fix an electric window, or replace a heater blower, or an automatic radio antenna but not its motor, or understand the vacuum system so you can trouble-shoot and fix vacuum-dependant things, I have one word for you: FORGEDDABOUDIT! This Chilton is pathetically superficial. A complete waste of time. Over-rated, over-hyped, and insultingly vague. Burn this!"
3,TOTAL car care??? Not really,"This book does not cover every aspect of the car. It does help though. If you buy this book you might want to get the Haynes version as well. Two books printed by the same company yet very different...odd. Between the two of them you can get almost all the info you need. Both books are severly lacking/or just plain wrong in the body interior section. If you are lucky enough to own the official GM Service manuals for your car and you are not a professional mechanic,The Chilton & Haynes books will help in understanding what it is the service manual is trying to tell you. Sort of like one of those dummies books that were popular not too long ago :o)"
4,A Wonderful and Timely Book!,"I have known Rocky D. for close to 20 years and when he told mehe was writng a novel, I was surprised. You never know what a fiend can do. I didn't realise that Rocky had such a great story in him.Grampa Jack brings to the forefront that all children deserve a happy, safe and loving home! Kids don't care who loves them no matter what the race or age or life style is, just that an adult or adults are there for them.Rocky brings out all the good points in his characters, plus the flaws they have. His story telling is so realist that I was feeling sorry for one of the main characters and wished I could take him aside and tell him to ""Chill Out Babe"". I hope that everyone who reads this book will enjoy it as much as I have. Also, this storyline will continual in another novel!Joanie Penry"
4,Good Stuff,My Massage therapist uses this so I purchased it to use on my wife (she suffers from lower back issues) and its the best stuff I've used. Getting it was easy and the whole process was easy.
5,Ohhhh cool!,"This is an AWSOME doll! I'm curentley 9 and to be 10 in may 20, 2004. When I first saw bratz, I was like 8 and I thought ""these things are hideous! What's their point?"" But one of my good friends was playing with bratz with her sisters and I played too and it was FUN! They have lots of boyz and bratz girlz. But they had sun kissed Yasmin and another sun kissed boy. I got this Dana doll yesterday for a good report card and I've played with it alot! The hair is REALLY soft when you brush it for a little bit. She comes with 3 awsome clothes sets. She has a hiwian tee, long skirt, jean shorts, a hiwian flower tee, surffboard, hand bag, beach towel, a brush, 2 braclets, 1 necklace, a bikini set, snap on bare feet, snap on sandels, a blue star brush,and blue sunglasses. It's REALLY cool so I request you buy this doll!"
3,Eh...,"Again, this is not great but not bad, either. It tries to tell the story of how Kirk came to know that he had a son named David. There is also the introduction of the Klingon Captain Krug (played by Christopher Lloyd in ST:III). This novel did not, however, keep my attention as others had. I found myself 'spacing-out' at times, as the novel failed to really keep my attention."
3,Not a bad story.,"Not great, but not bad; this story purports to tell the tale of the first meeting between Kirk and his son David Marcus, as well as to establish the reason for some of the hostility displayed toward Kirk by David in ""The Wrath Of Khan"". It establishes the character of David fairly well, but the justification for the hostility is weak at best, and the subplot involving the political machinations of the Klingons seems decidedly spurious, merely an excuse for the Klingons behaving in odd and implausible ways later.A perfectly good adventure novel, which mostly fails at its attempts to a pretension to be more than that."
1,Worst Ever,"I purchased this read because it mentioned or made reference to real life interesting women. I believed the book would offer some factual information about the lives of these complex women that perhaps was unknown to the reader. Information that would yield insight as to why the media has concluded or labeled, fairly or unfairly, that these particular women are ""Bitches"". After reading the book in its entirety, I came to the conclusion that the author used these names to sell a book about ""nothing"" in order to make money. The book is not, and has nothing to do with, any of the women mentioned or referenced in it."
1,AA,"I haven't read the book yet but was skimming through and read about her visit to an AA meeting in LA. She names names! This strikes me as beyond wrong. Does she hate these people? There's seems to be no reason for it other than to say, hey look, these people are alcoholics. So rude and ruthless. Anyway, it made me not want to read the book. Good thing I bought it used."
1,Don't Waste Your Time & Money on This Piece of Trash,"Great, more caterwalling from this self-obsessed, immature, indignant egomaniac. Do us all a favor Lizzy, and throw in the towel. You're schtick is overtired. You're pushing 40. Would you finally grow up and stop torturing the nation with your whining?That's right, your depression was real. But you were 19. You were nothing but a scared little girl. It doesn't take a Harvard education to figure that out.And this book, I yie yie. Please go on another bender and never ever take pen to paper again. You'll be doing us all a huge favor."
2,Bitching and Moaning,"I was eager to read Bitch after having read Prozac Nation years before. I was sorely disappointed. Wurtzel rants and expounds on various maligned women throughout history. Her rambling can be hard to follow and I soon lost interest. This book had a lot of potential but Wurtzel just wasn't able to deliver.I later read her memoir of drug addiction and recovery, More, Now, and Again which explained Bitch's dismal failure. It turns out that during the time Wurtzel was writing Bitch she was heavily using a myriad of drugs.I suggest reading Prozac Nation and More, Now and Again (which are fabulous)and skipping Bitch. Read Manifesta and Grassroots for a modern perspective on feminism."
1,Wurtzel needs to quit!,"Typical overly opinionated stuff from an author who is more hype than substance. Her mis-titled ""Prozac Nation,"" may be her peak proformance, depite some major problems in that book. This pseudo-feminist stuff comes straight from ""Cosmo,"" ""Glamour,"" etc. Save your $$."
2,not a pretty picture,"This book should be called ""Idiot"", and Wurtzel should substitute her middle finger for the second ""i"". What a dissapointment after the brave, interesting ""Prozac Nation."" She rambles, she bores, she has trite epiphanies...This is a poorly written piece of junk, especially her smug, self-congratulatory tone."
3,Great book but........,"I really did like this book. Wurtzel is a very witty author and she uses savvy commentary to draw the reader in. The only real problem with the novel that I found was that she used a lot of Biblical references (ex: Delilah) and while they are good examples, they become very repetitive. One chapter is solely based on Delilah alone and it took me forever to get through...A good read, especially if you like Biblical references to modern day situations."
4,Knocked for a loop,"This book is knocking me for a loop. It hits so close to home that it agitates me so I can only read a bit at a time. I feel like I've been closed in a box and I want to break out for ""MORE MORE MORE!"" Elizabeth Wurtzel has been there too. The opening chapter in particular captures this sense of unwelcome restraint bursting at the seams. The writing style is sometimes over the top, and it sort of dances around in a nonlinear way, but this just adds to its agitational effect. This powerful book is a must-read for 30-something women, ""rich and spoiled"" or not (believe me, I'm neither, not by a long shot), delineating such hard truths that they are sometimes difficult to face head-on. If you don't see yourself in the pages here, and if you don't feel stirred up by what you read here, you are probably already dead inside."
2,An average Bitch,"I am a HUGE Elizabeth Wurtzel fan..but Bitch disappointed me.. It's poorly written and how can you not know that Elizabeth I signed Mary Queen of Scotts death warrant! Or at least get it fact checked.Read MORE, NOW, AGAIN...now theres a book."
4,LizStrikesAgain!,"Ms. Wurtzel's latest is another hit! Two pitches, two hits! She's batting 1000, I figure. ""Bitch"" is another collection of Wurtzel writing as only she can. Somehow her ideas, her different slant on things keeps us interested and it's better conversation than most of us have on any give day!"
4,"Lucky ""Bitch""","Sad, depressed, product of a broken home (luckily, it would seem) graduate of Harvard, music critic for national publications, professional drug abuser - Ms. Wurtzel certainly likes to push the envelope of our indulgence and toleration. So she's back with a book that, again, is more or less about her and her feelings and opinions and, according to Newsweek, struggling her way out of rehab - this time for ""speed"". As a great fan of Wurtzel's midriff (cover of ""Prozac Nation"") I'll certainly buy this one for the bare-breast cover! Oh well, great marketing is great marketing..."
3,If only it weren't also about her.,"I wanted to like this, and I had high hopes for it after Prozac Nation (which I'm pretty sure a number of depressed teenage girls have adopted as their holy book). Prozac Nation was written as a memoir, though, so I expected her to talk about herself. Bitch is composed of chapters which can be summarized with about two cogent points each. The rest is her repeating herself, talking about herself and occasionally despising societal expectations of females."
1,"""Bitch"" a real dog of a book","I'm sure Elizabeth Wurtzel's friends find her coy ""agonizing"" about her character flaws, her relentless self-justification, and her brutal putdowns of others' lives and choices fascinating, if not charming. For the rest of us, however, ""Bitch"" is a four-hundred-page exercise in boredom and embarrassment.I expected very little from this book; even so, I was disappointed. If anyone wants to read about self-empowering women dealing with social preconceptions about corporeality and sexuality, I strongly suggest the brilliant ""Carnal Acts"" by Nancy Mairs."
1,rambling manuscript in search of an editor,"I loved Prozac Nation and was more than willing to forgive a first author her foibles - lack of coherence and cohesiveness. But in this, a long and boring rant without focus, there is simply no excuse. It reminded me of those endless nights helping an otherwise bright woman friend come down off coke or speed. There are too many other well-written books out there. Spare yourself."
1,self aggrandizing - utter gutter trash,"I guess this is the fad of the week. Another cool rant from a modern day social commentarian, one that only the juvenile mind could possibly appreciate. What a boring prattle from a spoilt brat of an ""author"". Shes obviously made a mess of her life, and is so self absorbed that she feels it is important enough to interest somebody. the only people who could gain from this drivel are other self pitying kindred spirits who want to damage their lives even more. Has humanity sunk so low?Heres a piece of advice for the author and any would be readers: Take responsibility for your actions in life, for you bare the consequences."
3,interesting interpretation on pop culture and feminism,"I've only read the first third of this book and have to agree that it is indeed a disappointment after Prozac Nation. Whereas Prozac Nation was gritty, feisty, and intensely personal, Bitch reads more like someone's doctoral dissertation on pop culture and feminism. That aside, if you read the book as an intersting collage of feminist theories, history, and tv's Hard Copy, it makes for somewhat interesting entertainment."
4,Takes one to know One,"Okay--so Wurtzel's ultimate interest is in her own self-image as a hiply disgusted, crybaby Bitch whose talent for getting laid is a redemptive, interesting quality. Don't read it as if it were interesting. Read it because the writing rocks."
3,Better than network television!,"Elizabeth Wurtzel's ""Bitch"" is the Spice Girls cover of Clarissa Pinkola Estes's ""Women Who Run With the Wolves.""[Baseline calculation: 50 books/year x 50 years = 2500 books.] While spending 0.04% of my reading effort on ""Bitch"" might not sound like an absolute waste of time, I got more sheer enjoyment from Shakespeare's ""Troilus and Cressida."""
1,"Vapid, Insipid, and just plain awful!","I enjoyed Wurtzel's first effort and eagerly awaited the publication of Bitch. Bitch was not what I had expected or hoped for. The stream of consciousness style, in which Bitch is written, does not suit her. The result is that Bitch reads like an amphetamine fueled rant on pop culture."
3,trying hard to be outrageous,"The title and book cover (and my copy has a image of the author much less fig-leafed than the one shown above) suggest that Wurtzel is looking for shock value to draw in readers. She does have some interesting and different insights on Amy Fisher and other women, asseen through the lens of her own troubled past. Wurtzel starts out with a funny, frenetic rant on women's treatment in even the most modern history, but has trouble sustaining the pace, and eventually grows repetitive, and a little self-centered for my taste."
1,Awful.,"I got through the intro in the bathtub and I'm not impressed with it, she's really indecisive and doesn't seem to have a set thesis statement, also reads as dated, it was published in 1998 and a lot of what she's talking about has been resolved or at least better exemplified."
2,Disjointed and definitely difficult,"As a radical feminist, I was pathetically amused and enraged by this book. It does not celebrate women's strength or struggle, instead finding glory in the consolation prizes of temptress roles and the like. As a reader, I was intrigued but confused. It's easy to lose your place - the author is very clever but harder to stay with than a mechanical bull. I don't think any book i've ever read has given my facial muscles such a workout: i'm sure someone watching my expressions as I read would have been the more entertained of the group. Now that i've learned it was written during a drug binge, I understand it better and can get some sleep. We can do better."
4,Were Were Edmund Wilson born a woman in the 60's.....,"he may've penned something like this.Her endless pop cultural references got boring but it was easy to skim them over and come back in on yarns I was more interested in. She makes some choice poetic descriptions of her subjects. My favorite was about Amy Fisher being ""As vulnerable as Austro-Hungary on the eve of WWI, a weak and unassertive territory with boundaries and ideologies up for grabs."" I'll never again be able to think of said empire the same! The only thing better would be a historian comparing Austro-Hungary to Amy Fisher. Also, the closing of the Fisher essay is very very moving, very heavy, deep and poetic. The more I combed thru these essays the more I enjoyed them, there was fun and insights in the rambling and yet and yet I wish she'd tightened the screws and wielded the axe and turned this into the classic it hints at but never quite achieves."
2,where the hell did that come from?!?!,"That just happened to be what I was usually thinking when I read the book. Several steps in examples are skipped, very little reason for each step is given. Also the formulas are hard to locate some are set off in grey boxes others are blended into the text."
1,"Terrible book, period.","With so many wonderful books available on this subject, I wonder why Mr. Ross felt the need to write this one. It is basically an unintelligible tangle of botched text on what is actually a fairly straightforward and interesting subject. It is unfortunate that this bok is required reading for many undergraduate courses. I can only wonder how many potentially gifted practitioners never persue the subject further because of the bad impression this book leaves. Save your money and your frustration by seeking out any other book on the subject."
1,confusing and badly organized,avoid at all costs. important equations lost in irrelevant text. problems not divided by section and examples don't reflect the material in problems. Many proofs and explanations skip steps and assume much. solution manual needed but unavailable. good luck if stuck with - don't buy if don't have too!!
4,Good introductory book but it can be quite challenging ...,"I have mixed feelings about this book. Being an introductory probability text, it does a good job of presenting the basic concept followed by lots of examples. But if you look at some of the examples closely, they are rather hard (especailly beginners seeing it for the first time). Fortunately for me, I have learned the concepts elsewhere before so I can see why it can be quite challenging for newbies.Also, some students may not have exposure to induction, recursion, writing proofs, etc. - it will help if the instructor would guide them through the steps since many of the combinatorics problems would involve the use of them.Another book at the same level as Ross's that I like is John Rice's ` Mathematical statistics and data analysis `. For the mathematically inclined student, I would also suggest mathematical probability book like William Feller's."
5,Pure nostalgia,"I ordered Highway Patrol Season 1 on February 14, 2011 and three days later I am watching Highway Patrol. WOW!! What great customer service. I am watching the 1st disc as I write and it is just as I remembered it to be. As a child, I could hardly wait for each episode to air, how I loved this program. The quality is great, what a fabulous reproduction of material over half a century old. That's incredible. Thank you so much for offering this precious memory. Please consider offering more Seasons.Margaret Collette"
4,Brings back memories,"Watching ""Highway Patrol"" brings back many fine memories. The only draw back one has to remember before purchasing is that this show is 56 years old. You have to take into account that the budget for this show was nothing like what they spend today and it shows. But I still enjoy it and am glad I purchased it. As I said great memories here."
5,RELEASE THE REST OF THE SERIES,"This is a show I enjoyed as a kid, and was glad to see it finally available.For a show filmed in the fifties, the film quality is very good, and the episodes are enjoyable. It is nice to see the great old cars from the fifties."
1,been waiting and waiting for it to arrive,"Anyone else having Amazon trouble getting copies to you? Ordered it in August, still has not come and its Sept 20. Says will be in stock Sept 1, Sept 19 but nothing. Price varies from $44 to $47 day by day, but still no copies available. MGM is in trouble i hear."
5,OKAY DVD WAS LITTLE HIGH IN PRICE,OKAY PRICE WAS ALITTLE HIGH WHERE IS SEASON TWO WILL THE THE PRICE BE UNDER 20? WISH MORE SHOWS ON TV LIKE THOSE SHOWS.
2,DVD-R,"I am disappointed with this release. The description I do not believe is worth the money. Fortunately, I have not thrown away my VHS/DVD yet so I will be able to record the show and I think the picture quality will be equal. Wait for a better release or watch it as part of Amazon On Demand."
5,Great old series,"A bit pricey but worth it to fans of this old series. Unlike cop shows today, Highway Patrol is not unrealistically populated by glam 20-somethings (of both genders), or gratuitous violence or crude language. It comes across as genuine, and, after all these years, still entertains."
3,why the high cost!?,"$53.99 to $59.99 has stopped me from buying this although I'd like to have it. Can somebody tell me if my patience will be rewarded, or should I go ahead and order this DVD-R to encourage Amazon to offer more seasons of Highway Patrol? Please help!"
2,Boring,I had to read this book for a class I took in college and it was terrible. It was very choppy and hard to follow. It was also hard to get through because it was not interesting at all!
4,Comprehensive 4-Volume Set,The new edition is 1994 and sells new at about (...) That is very expensive for 4 books that are over ten years old. The former edition is 1984 and you should be able to find an affordable copy at the Amazon Marketplace. Be sure that all four volumes are being offered. The psychological information offered is comprehensive.
1,Good Idea - Poorly Executed,"I am a concertina player and thought my grandson would enjoy ""playing"" along with me with this toy concertina. It is not going to happen.The toy is very sturdy and looks to be very safe, It is a good concept and could be made into a nice toy with a little more effort from the manufacturer.There are two big problems:1. The bellows are too stiff. The bellows are made of a thick plastic and are so stiff that a small child cannot easily move them to make a sound.2. The sound it makes is horrible. It squawks when you pull it out and groans when you push it in. I know some people think all concertinas sound like that but it would have been so easy to have installed a musical sounding reed like they use in a cheap harmonica so it would make a musical sound.The toy looks good but I would not recommend it to anybody."
1,Total Bummer,"I really thought this would make chopping fresh herbs much easier, but it hasn't worked out for me. I was pleased because it was all metal and I am trying to avoid plastics, but neither basil or cilantro (the two herbs I use most) will shred in this. It juices them and it all gets stuck in the grinder. Even after washing it in the dishwasher there are still parts of herb that stick in there until they are really dry and then they flake off in my drawer. A great tool in concept, but never got it to work for me in practicality."
2,herb mill,I am not happy with this product. It is difficult to clean and doesn't seem to work well for me.
1,Billy the boy,"Dear Billy. Your theory about the JFK assasination is a disgrace to all Italians.You should be ashamed to tell such lies.The only reason is to sell more books.Your father and you pass yourselfs off as men of honor.You are not men,you are parasites. Sincerly Peter Corrado"
1,"Self serving, inflated self image waste of time.","Bill Bonanno thinks he is JFK - need I say more. The book is a meandering, teasing story line that keeps returning to the misguided thought that Bill and JFK are somehow living a similar life and fate . To bad they were not - then this book would of ended in 1963. Nothing new or interesting. Save your money."
4,Bound of Honor,"good read to past time, although it is a little bit frustrating if you read Puzo's Mafia novels or Lorenzo Carcatera's Gangster."
3,An ok mafia story,This is a sort of watered down story of a mafiosa. The author does not disclose or detail some of the slimy backhanded sneaky criminal things that he surely committed an the book borders on a made for LIFETIME movie vibe.
2,B.S.,"I'll keep it simple. The Bonnanos are the worst liars I've ever seen. Bill and Joe are trying to rewrite history, and it's getting pretty pathetic."
4,MAFIA BOOKS,"THANKS TO SOPRANOS, I HAVE TAKEN AN INCREDIBLE INTEREST IN THE MAFIA. I HAVE READ 4 BOOKS SO FAR, THIS BEING ONE OF THEM. THIS IS A GOOD BOOK, MORE OF A LIFE STORY,NOT QUITE LIKE UNDERBOSS, WHICH I ALSO READ. THIS BOOK SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT GOVERNING THE FAMILY AND ITS BUSINESS. IT IS REALLY BASED ON BILL AND HIS FATHER JOE BONNANO, NOT REALLY ON THE FAMILY AS A WHOLE. THE BOOK DOES TELL A GOOD DEAL ABOUT JFK AND HIS RELATION WITH THE BONNANO FAMILY, AS WELL AS WHERE JIMMY HOFFA IS (SUPPOSEDLY). Its not really a violent mafioso story, but, a good background on the Bonnano's."
4,A First Hand Perspective,"In Bound by Honor, Bill Bonanno mostly succeeds in giving an accurate description of his perspective of life as a ""mafiosi"". Although the book is bogged down early with boring details of his relationship with his wife, it builds over the last third to a satisfying ending. It is a text chock full of historical information that afficiondos of Mafia lore will find engrossing."
2,Legend of his own mind,"The book as such is an easy read and has some amusing stories, it is, however, filled with appearent contradictions and self promoting spins on most of the events.The writer is clearly unable to put is own life into perspective and believes he has done no wrong........but that the government is at fault for hunting down organised crime, mostly himself and his father (who is depicted as the role model mobster).The book is worth reading if the subject itself is of interest to you. For most readers it will become clear that the writer is a complete and total loser."
2,Bill Bonanno= Sorry Excuse For A Mobster,"This book isn't what I thought it would be. There's a part in this book where Bill Bonanno rags on Joe Valachi, saying that Valachi only knew ""street stuff"". Well whether thats true or not, Valachi was actually in the mafia and did mafia things. Bill Bonanno is nothing but a legend's son. Thats it. The great Joe Bonanno. And thats what this book is mostly about, ""my father this"", ""my father that"". Everytime Bill talks about something Mob related, its always from the 3rd person view, (AS in he was never there). The only reason he got made was cause he's the bosses son. So if your looking for a real mob book get The Five Families or The Valachi Papers. This book is mostly about how the mafia tied into politics, and about Bill Bonanno's personal life such as his marriage. If you want to read about real mafioso's, read about Lucky Luciano, Joeseph Massino, Vito Genovese, Gotti, or the DeCavalcante family."
1,Are you crazy or what?,"I've been studying the mafia for 20 years. I have a calabrese (not sicilian) background, and this helps me understanding the guys. I really could not understand this book. The guy is crazy. He says Carlo Gambino is a coward, Salvatore Lucania knows nothing, Lepke and Lansky are not even mentioned! This is a tribute to his family. In his point of view his father is the real Godfather and only the Bonannos and the Profacis (his wife family) are cool, smart and traditional. I'll just tell you what, if this guy is right, everyone else is wrong! Lost of time and money! And just a tip, as far as I know, and all the world knows, the first cappo di tutti i capi was Lucky, and the next one Gambino."
3,A Very Interesting Book,"""Bound By Honor"" was a great read. Bonanno is a master story teller. The book contains some very accurate history and some stories that are doubtful or hard to verify. I also found more than one hundred spelling and grammar errors in the book. ST. Martin's Press should check their books for spelling and grammar before publishing."
1,lousy excuse for a mobster!,"This is probably the second worst book about the mafia I have ever read, after ""man of honor"" by his father Joe Bonanno. As his father did, Bill Bonanno filled his book with so much worthless information about Sicilian tradition, honor, and customs that it's insulting to american born mobsters. First of all, he was born into a mafia family. If his dad wasn't boss, this guy wouldn't have lasted ten seconds in the mob. This whole book is very vague and superficial, never really going into detail about actual crimes or murders. If he would have wrote more about experiences and the inner workings of the families this book might have been readable. As it is, it's just some fake mobster trying to glorify himself. Do not waste money on this book, and if you already have it, burn it."
2,bound by honor,"This book is on the low end of any of the mob book I have read. The real take home story is the Bill Bonannano would not have been in that ""family"" if he wasn't Joe's son. He really has an outsiders few. He grew up in Arizona on a country club?"
4,Must read,"This little volume is undeniably one of the most discussed works of ethical philosophy in the Western tradition. It stems from Kant's work on metaphysics, established in the Critique of Pure Reason in which Kant lays out the crucial principles of human understanding. This work, is a logical extension of Kant's noumenal-phenomenal division, in which man is given the choice of being an ethical legislator. For Kant, universality is the primary guideline to all ethical choice, in contradistinction to the utilitarian thinkers such as Mill and Bentham. There is nothing in this book that will sound peculiar to a new reader, as the ideas are so rational from a Western-Enlightenment point of view, they simply formulate what we have already been told. Never the less, this is essential reading for any real understanding of ethics and its development in relation to its rejection in the post-modern tradition. The translator, James Ellington, has done a fair job to Kant's work."
4,Standard,I have to read this along with Mill's Utilitarianism as part of an ethics class and I like this translation the best.
5,Most profound work in Ethical Theory,"This is one of my favorite works in ethical theory. Kant provides a very deep and specific foundation for his moral thought, something that many other ethical theorists tend to shy away from.I would recommend this text for any philosophy student or anyone with a serious interest in philosophy."
3,Obviously dated,"I'm not willing to go so far as to say you shouldn't read Kant. However many of his examples are humorously dated, and his views on morality are anything but moral.I have trouble taking seriously a man who would tell us right from wrong, yet has the following beliefs:Masterbation and homosexuality are worse than murderIf a slave escapes you have a obligation to return him to slaveryThere is nothing wrong with killing children born outside of marriageNo matter how badly you are treated by those in charge of you, you have a moral obligation to grin and bear it. Your betters have the right to treat you like a dog, they just ""shouldn't""And these are just a few of many examples. So once again, read this book if you must. But make sure you pay attention, so that you get everything he is trying to say."
2,Do not buy!!!!!!!!!!,"I ordered it over two weeks agao and still no thing - that is a good reason not to get it at ALL!!!Signed,VERY UPSET"
5,a really great band,"I stumbled across this band on the punk goes acoustic 2 cd. This is a wonderful debut from a talented band. The band has 2 lead singers and both bring an interesting aspect to the cd. One of them left the band before the record was even released, but he is on the cd. You should enjoy this cd with both of them because future cd's might not have the same strength. Very catchy lyrics and great music make you want to listen to it over and over. Oh and the track list above is not this cd. Enjoy!"
3,so-so,Some ok tunes on this disc but it isn't something I would write home about. I look forward to them possibly getting better on their next album.
5,Great c.d,"Just took a few listens of this c.d and its not bad , the lyrics are catchy and the vocals are strong , i reccomend this band for fans of underground warpedtour bands"
1,Horrible Emo BS,"When I first heard of this band, I was excited. I thought that the music on this cd would be something that I could enjoy and, yes, the music did seem well written at first until I listened to the lyrics... but unfortunately, the mediocre melodies and angsty lyrics only made me throw up a little bit every second in my mouth. Before drowning in my own vomit, I had to turn it off. Thanks Mayday Parade for being another band that does not create anything new. At least I had some fun using it as a frisbee for a while."
5,"To my suprise, a great album...","I've never been a fan of Mayday Parade even after several of my friends tried to push their music on me, I finally broke down and bought this album used and I was so shocked to find out how great this album really is, this is one of the very few albums I can listen all the way through from start to finish, I can't skip a song or pick a favorite. All these songs are very catchy and have great lyrics.. This album has turned me into a Mayday Parade fan.. Now I am kicking myself for skipping out on the 3 Mayday Parade concerts that my friends begged me to go to, but I passed up."
5,"Finally, Sam Rivers writing can be heard by all","It is about time someone recorded Sam River's big band compositions. The music here is exciting, the performances solid, and the personnel first rate. The music lives up to Sam River's stature as one of the few great masters of the music."
3,five for inspiration zero for listening pleasure,"This music is completely extreme. Its way too dischordant and only seems to resolve itself once every 40 bars, and then only for one beat. I can't believe this was recommended to average jazz browsers as the best of 99. Its the musical equivalent to Jackson Pollock and Henry Bacon making a piece of art together. Bacon laying down some twisted sculpture whilst Pollock sellotapes canvas on parts and flicks paint all over it. If you put this as background music to a film, the screen would have to be split into twelve with manic cinematography in ten of them, a beautifully edited, touching play in one, and an annoying flickering strobe light in the twelvth. Ironically, despite hating 98% of it, this is one hell of an inspiration."
1,diluted,"From the very beginning, this book is confusing. The plot is diluted in the long narratives and descriptions of scenery and there is very little character development. The reader is lost by the different layers of the plot that are meant to be clever, but end up being boring and confusing. Half of the time, one hardly knows which characters to side with. The other half of the time the reader comes across a character in the scene he/she didn't know was there. The reader looses track of who is characterized by what and the ultimate goal of the main knight in the first place. All in all, I would never reccommend this book to anyone and will most likely never read it again."
4,"Intriguing, engaging fantasy","This is a beautiful fantasy, weaving the stories of a woman in a tower, a knight searching for a way to free her, and another young man, attempting to free his country from outside domination. As usual, Patricia McKillip's prose is exquisite and lyrical, her characters interesting and well-drawn. The plot, however, was a trifle hard to follow, especially with the shifting perspectives and the plethora of towers, but, overall, a very nice read."
2,Lost when i opened it and still am,"The book was detailed and lovely with the setting. To tell you the truth, the setting was the only thing that made sense to me. I was lost from the first page on. The book went on forever and seemed pointless. I enjoyed it though, it was lovely, All the authors book are, and thats why I LIKE this book, but The Forgotton Beasts Of Eld is still my favorite"
3,Beautiful writing with a weak plot,"At her best, Patricia McKillip writes prose which is just sparse enough in its descriptions to give the reader's imagination room to flower. And this book has some of the best prose she's written. Unfortunately the story line is tremendously confusing. It is told from five perspectives, three of which have love interests of some sort. Keeping track of who is who takes tremendous effort. And there isn't space to fully develop the love interests (even though that of Cyan Dag is vital to the plot), with the result that the book ends poorly -- with loose ends and an unconvincing love match."
3,"Beautifully written, but ultimately disappointing","McKillip writes beautifully and creates gorgeous images, so the essential pointlessness of this book may go unnoticed by some readers. I found that the two main male characters were so similar as to be indistinguishable. The plot was, at best, nebulous. It was rarely clear what was going on or even who each character was, which had the result of making it hard to care what happened. Overall, it seemed that the author was constantly trying to convey some ""deep"" philosophical point, but without ever really saying anything profound. Some of the better scenes are very reminiscent of her earlier work involving magical creatures and shapechanging, and I'd recommend rereading those instead."
3,Disappointed,I love the PD band...just didn't realize how many songs they had. As with most CD's not all songs were popular and I only liked a handful of the more popular ones. I think the CD is over priced.
5,Nikwax,Love this stuff! My motorcycle riding pants needed to be cleaned. Follow the directions exactly as listed on the bottles and the pants are as good as new (except for the fading!)
5,Amazing!,"I used the tech wash first according to directions, then the wash in. My rain jacket has a very fabric feel to it and is breathable and I thought it would never repel water after so many detergent wash cycles... I pulled it out of the washer when every step was done and it was soaking wet... I thought that it had not worked. I put it in the dryer on low delicates. 30 minutes later I poured a pool of water in the center of the back and it never went through the fabric! The wash in fluid has a waxy feel to it but not to worry, you can't tell a difference once all phases of directions are done!! I definitely recommend buying this!!"
4,The Twins,"I'm only giving this four stars because I haven't used the TX Wash-In one yet. The Tech Wash I have used for yrs in a front loading machine on 'gentle' and then drying the garment with low heat and three tennis balls. Absolutely wonderful results. However, my machine doesn't do sleeping bags properly because of its size...off to the laundry mat and their giant front loaders!"
3,Good for a little extra coating,I was hoping this would provide a little better water proofing. But unfortunately it only provides a sort of water resistant film. It's good if you are just using it for light rain or mist. But it doesn't really stand a chance with the rains in the Northwest.
3,Nikwax care kit,"I followed directions on both Tech Wash and TX Direct wash-in. After Tech Wash, I left the items in the front load washer without inspection, and proceeded with a second cycle with the TX Direct wash-in treatment. After that cycle, I transferred the items to the dryer. After drying, I discovered there was dirt on the outer shell. It was leaf dust from a Stihl 2 cycle blower/mulcher. I was able to brush off the dirt. Go figure! Water repellency is fine."
1,Nikwax care kit...no good,This has to be the biggest rip off I have ever gotten rooked with. I followed the instructions to the very minute. This stuff made my Rem Cloth leak worse than it did before I used it. Nikwax Care Kit for Waterproof/Breathable Fabrics
1,Big disappointment!,"The first time I treated my polyester shower curtain, I think it actually became more water ABSORBENT!! I contacted the manufacturer which kindly sent me a replacement and advised me to soak the curtain for at least one hour, which I did. Well, it is somewhat better, but no way is it truly water repellent. Very disappointed. Save your money."
1,Waste of money,"I read up on all the various waterproofing products because my cloth (600 Denier Carbolex) motorcycle jacket needed to be treated. So I decided on Nikwax. I bought the pre-wash and the spray on waterproofing, since the wash-in waterproofing would waterproof the inside, which wasn't needed. With the spray I could get it on the outer shell where I wanted it. I followed the instructions, first wash the garment then spray and let dry. Then I wore it in the rain a few weeks later. I got soaked. It actually made it worse than before. I wish I had just left it alone. I've used the inexpensive spray-on products that work better than this product. Save your money."
5,Waterproof Again!,I was very happy with this product. It worked very well to renew the waterproofing of my lightweight rain shells and heavier ski jackets. I will point out that the tech wash is good for approximately 3 loads of 1-3 jackets. But the whole bottle of TX-Direct must be applied to one load so you may want to purchase extra TX-Direct if you wish to do more than 3 jackets.
1,philips a dud...,Recentley bought 2 shoqboxs from diffrent sources one of witch did not work at all the other took a crap on me after downloading music onto it. After returning both and wasting everybodys time decided to stick with ipod... till philips gets its stuff together.
1,Don't buy if you have a dog!,"This vacuum would be fine if we didn't have a dog. Every time we use it, the dog fur clogs the intake hose. You have to clear it each time you want to use it!"
1,Eureka 5844AV Litespeed,This vacuum is awful. Don't even consider it. It has never worked from the day I got it and Amazon would not let me return it because it had been more than 30 days since the purchase date. It spews dust and dirt out all over the place. I had it repaired once (No Warranty was provided for this specific problem) and it stills spews out dirt. I'm putting it in a dumpster this weekend.....
2,LOOOOONG!!!,The movie was long. I didn't watch it til the end. The plot was good but production a little on the sloppy side. Not as good as the cover looks
1,DON'T SMOKE CRACK! WHILE FILMING,"I'll make this plain and simple. There's your B-Rated Movies in which this doesn't even deserves that rate. If there have ever been a C-Rating then this would qualify perfectly, C-Rate for CRAP!!!!"
5,Remarkable solo piano effort.,"Listening to Joe's accomplished playing evokes emotions you never know you were capable of. His solo piano sounds like an orchestra. ""You Take Me To The Top"" is a collection of teriffic standards and brilliant, thought provoking originals. My personal favorite is the original composition, ""Allegheny Waltz"". It is a beautiful melody that creates a vision of the natural beauty of the Allegheny region of Central New York State. Listening to this music will take you to a place far away from the pressures and worries of the world. Grab a set of headphones, sit in your most comfortable chair and allow yourself to be whisked away!I wish there was more available from this most gifted artist. This disk will certainly have you yearning for more. A brilliant offering from 1998."
4,Adventures of Daddy-Man,"Trumpet is allegedly based upon an actual experience that my father had when he was young. I found the story funny, and a little scary at times--especially the climax where he's up in the airplane with one of the bad guys and gets shot at. Overall, it was pretty interesting. I liked the way Detetch seemed to tell the story the way my father would have, not knowing anything about paleontology at the time and making guesses about it's history and the details of the science. It's written in a very easy-to-follow, casual style that lets you get through it quickly. I think it would make a great beach book or travel book. Now I just have to find out exactly how much of it is true--especially the twist at the end!"
5,"see them live, too!!!!!","I'm a presenter of live music, and have had Grada three times. They never fail to give one of the best shows going, and we've had some big names. I can't recommend one of their cd's over another, they're all great and are always in constant cd-player rotation. Get 'em all! It's Irish music but with a jazz twist. During one soundcheck, Andrew, the bassist, launched into a five-minute Mingus solo compilation, a little of all his most famous bass lines. They can play it all perfectly."
5,Songs of Pride...Charley That Is,"I have to concur with Mr. Ferrell. This is one of Charley's best (and most underrated) efforts. ""The Easy Part's Over"" went to number two on the Billboard charts in 1968; listen to the song and you'll know why. Charley is my favorite artist, so you make think I'm a little biased, but this is a great compact disc. No bland re-recordings here, people---this is all original material. From the first selection, ""Someday You Will,"" to the last, ""The Top of the World,"" you will be impressed by Charley's incredible vocals. I love this album so much I have both the LP and the CD. Please give it a listen. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
4,Beautifully presented with many historical examples,"In an era when many books about typography principles focus on the ins and outs of specific computer programs, here is a beautiful book for beginners that focuses on principles, theory, and examples.Not as densely written as Bringhurst's classic ""Elements"" book, this book nonetheless has the advantage of being more quickly scannable, and it features many spreads that present actual book designs at full size or nearly so, giving a very tactile look to the book.Other concepts about leading, word spacing, letterforms, and so on are presented with large visual displays specifically constructed by the author.I would recommend this book for beginning graphic design students or for libraries interested in visual arts literacy."
3,okay,This book isn't really what I was hoping for. It talks more about the history of type and letter form. I was hoping for more ways to play with type and ideas for how to do it.
1,Absolute junk.,"Product quality and fit were very poor. Instructions were missing vital steps and/or misleading. If you have extra room in your garbage can you may want to use this item as filler. I bought two. After the fiasco of trying to assemble the first one (it got to the trash can on step 22), I gave the remaining one to a neighbor I don't especially enjoy."
4,Very Useful Information,When first diagnosed with sleep apnea I didn't know where to turn. This book really helped me. I was an easy read and had alot of useful information. I would recommend it to anyone who suffers as I do.
1,sleep apnea,I have been diagnosed with apnea and use a CPAP. I bought four books to gain a deeper insight into my condition. While informative this book does not cover the subject nearly as well as Sleep Apnea - Phantom of the Night. I would not recommend purchase of this book. In fact this was the least helpful.
5,A must have!,"This is THE book on the Soviet Armed Forces as they were just before the breakup of the USSR. The author visted military units all over the former Soviet Union to provide an extensive, up-close look at the Red Army. Several of the Soviet officers we are introduced to in this book are now prominent (sometimes infamous) Russian political figures. Every branch of service is covered: infantry, the tank force, navy, air force, the elite Airborne/Air Assault units, etc. Also contains the first real look inside the near-mythical Spetznaz forces. Incredible illustrations from front to back. A real find for the Soviet/Russian military enthusiast. Do yourself a favor and find a copy of this book."
1,terrible,I threw out my money on this appliance. Next time I get a more expensive one. Cheap is cheap.
4,"Good, basic, Mandolin","I bought this mandolin (or something that looks just like it - German made, same box and accessories) about 25 years ago and used it again this week to slice potatoes for a gratin. It works perfectly. The guard is well designed to prevent injuring the user while still slicing the entire potato and it is easy to clean. The julienne blades work well too. No, it is not fancy and might not be up to heavy duty use. Yet, for someone like me who does not use a mandolin often (I have three food processors)and is short on storage space, this one just the right size, easy to use, and functional when I just have a few items to slice or julienne."
5,"Plain, Simple, German-Made Slicer. PERFECT!","I read all the reviews for all the mandoline slicers in this price range and decided to go with the German-made product. I suspected it would have few bells and whistles and would do its job WELL. I have not been disappointed.PROS:Very simple design. Easy to use, easy to clean. Blades snap in and out. There is a french fry blade, a julienne blade, and a straight blade which can be set for different slicing thicknesses.Slices beautifully. I haven't used the French Fry blade. I minced a large onion in about 20 seconds flat with the julienne blade. THAT is definitely a pro.Razor sharp blades.CON:Razor sharp blades could be a hazard. There is no covering or guard or storage for the blades, so they have to be washed and stored carefully."
3,Okay...but,"The book is a nice collection of already known facts but little of the whole history of the program. While it is interesting in its cutaways and photographs there is little of the meat and potatoes as to why this great aircraft was built. Also noticed reference to another great XB-70 book in the header of one of the chapters. For a photographic interpretation of this airplane, its okay but I found it disjointed in sections."
4,Wilsonian,"Excellent reading and Photographs, details very interesting as to its construction similar to Concorde's.Thanks Amazon for your suggestions to me and perfect books on delivery."
5,Great Book!,"Truly amazing how much data the authors managed to get into a 104 page book. Good paper, great photos, lots of interesting data"
4,Previously published as two volumes,"This books was previously published as two volumes with the tiles ""Pyramids"" and ""After the Fact"", both now out of print."
1,"You get what you pay for, I guess","The price was good, but the product fell apart in about a week. Made me very sad, but I guess you get what you pay for, just need to find a quality Bowie keychain."
1,outdated,"This book was written in 1982, updated in 1995. It has a whole section on cameras, which isn't useful since most of them are outdated. Doesn't even mention digital cameras. Since it specifically discusses the mechanics of cameras, I found this book to be disappointing."
2,A diversion,"This album was inspired by _Guitar, Drums & Bass_, & similarly has Bailey playing over a variety of prerecorded electronic rhythm tracks. Bailey is playing well, which makes it doubly frustrating that many of the tracks are tedious in the extreme--try the opening track (programmed by Darryl Moore) for a good instance of the disparity between the guitarist's typically shrewd contributions & the feebleness of the underlying track. If you're looking for off-the-wall Bailey, try _Mirakle_, which has him with a jazz-funk rhythm section & turns out an unexpected success. This disc is only for the curious. Fans of John Oswald's plunderphonics will want to note that track 11 is an Oswald cut-up of a solo recording by Bailey; Bailey doesn't play on top of it."
2,"A mixed-up mess, I have never seen such all over the place","This book did too much jumping around for me. I have never seen a book that covers twenty years time and you never knew the times were changing, it seemed to me in one paragraph they were children and in the next they were in college and going to exotic places. I give Ellis a break because this was her first novel, but she needs to work more on character development because hers is very poor. The characters were not plausible or believeable. There was too much focus on skin and hair color and texture, the parents and the children had very limited dialogue. Because of this we were not allowed to see and understand the dynamics of their relationship, the husband and wife had no dialogue about family, children, or their lives in general. I mean this book was simply the pits and I'm glad that I didn't spend any money on it because I would demand a refund."
2,"It was OK, a little difficult to read","I like the story on how this family made it to the upper middle class. The author was insightful of the attitudes they had to overcome and that was interesting. However, the book was slow reading. It was difficult to stay focused and follow at times. I found that the book just ended. Kind of left one hanging. I felt the author should have told about what happened with the twins and Tommytwo."
3,too much vocals,"This refers to my previous review and reveiws of some other fans:I think everyone knows that flamenco is not only guitar playing! but paco is famous because of his brilliant style of playing flamenco guitar...I think he got what he wanted so hes back to the traditional style now and if he continues like this i would say that its time for him to retire!one more thing i have to add is that if paco previous albums were all similar styles to this one! he would have never been recognised internationaly! just see above the number of used cd's of this album for sale!!its more than 70!! fans are disapointed!Old reveiw:Paco is best when he is playing alone(without singers)..he is a 10 star as a guitar player infact he is the best of them all, but this album is nothing compared to the previous one's, but as a paco fan still u should have it.the thing i didnt like was the singers! the good thing was the rumba..the music quality is very good...come on paco give us the old styles.."
5,A new side of Samite,"I enjoyed the new ""Stars to Share"" by Samite. His music continues to grow from its African roots. The thing that makes his music different from other artists is its diversity and complexity. One never tires of listening to it. Every Album and every performance shows us a new side of this gifted artist."
3,a disappointment to a long-time Samite fan,"Samite is a wonderfully inventive artist and his warmth and humor usually show through on all of his earlier releases. Unfortunately on this CD his distinctive sound gets swallowed up and lost amid all of the electric pianos, guitars and synthesizers. I only hope being on a bigger label will expose him to a wider audience and they will be drawn to buy those wonderful, unassuming first recordings that give one a truer idea of what African music and this wonderful artist are all about ..."
4,One of Pattinson's best,"This is a slow paced but addictive book. It's about a gang who wear animal masks, robbing the rich at gun point in their homes. Two novice muggers Corina and Joe choose the wrong victim to rob. He (Victor) however has plans for the future and these two will do just fine. The animal gang is born.If you've mistakenly arrived at this book thinking this was a James Patterson book don't leave so soon. This book's not bad. It's a good English crime novel with young interesting characters. James Pattinson's novels vary in quality. Some are really good and others not very good at all. The Animal Gang is one his best but his best ever would his masterpiece Crane."
5,Great book!,"Leora Krygier has the ability to entice this reader into caring about and following the lives of two men (Amir and Rosenberg, a pair of unlikely friends) and their families as though these characters are real people --and maybe they are? FIRST THE RAVEN is a powerful story -- one that drained me emotionally in a very satisfying way."
3,It's OK but could have been much better.,This book is actually the sequel to Prophet's power. It's OK but has a few problems with the locations and the behavior of the aliens. Still a good read for fans of the original Unreal game.
2,"Not a bad read, but not very Unreal.","This book was an easy read but did not seem to have very much in common with the environment expressed in the game upon which it is based. The game seems to show the native Nali as being a very religious culture, and yet in the book this aspect is not even mentioned once. I never got the sense that this was an alien race on an alien world. For all intents and purposes, the Nali could have just been four-armed pacifistic humans on an alternate Earth."
1,Well........ HUH?,"This is worse than the Doom series of novels... It is as if the author changed the story a good dozen times in the -EXACT SAME BOOK.... I give it a 1, it's just plain stupid."
2,Not bad...,"but I've read better.I was dissapointed. I was looking for something I could relate to. It felt more like a school book, something that you trudge along with, and in the end you've learned something but the trip there was long and kind of boring."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book/tape. I thought it would give me some real insights into life and spirituality, as alot of good books have. But this was just nausiatingly gay, hopelessly drippy, and not insightful at all. I didn't want anyone to read poetry to me or ask me to notice what a peach looks like. I wanted something different. I give it two stars because I know other people liked it, and others may find it nice to read/listen to."
5,great spiritual book with different stories,"Better than Chicken Noodle Soup for the Soul!Great book.This book allows you to see different sides of things and it has really great TRUE stories, poems and more!"
3,"Well-designed, but with a significant flaw","I used this player for about a week when my Zen Micro's audio jack died. I really liked the sleek design, with the touch-sensitive light-up controls, and I found the directional UI to be very intuitive.However, the reason I returned this player is because the interface was slow. Painfully slow. It often took up to 5 seconds to transition between screens, especially during playback. This was completely unacceptable, so I exchanged the player for an 8GB Zen Micro Photo.It is a shame, though, since if this had been better tested and marketed, it could have been a true iPod-killer.One other thing to note: the bundled headphones are beautiful. They are of the canalphone type, and they fit well and have excellent audio quality."
4,Sleek and stylish,"I went to bestbuy to get an ipod but ended up buying ""Philips HDD6330 30 GB MP3 Player"". I am impressed by its performance. I was little skeptical while buying, as this being a new product from Philips. I got the 2 warranty which costed me another $30 and I am glad i got the warranty after looking at the reviews here. But quite frankly i didnt hv any problems till now. The product looks great!! its nice that they hv a inbuilt voice recorder which records pretty well. i would recommand this for the price. the only drawback is, it doesn't have that many accessories as an ipod."
1,Philips is not a worthy mp3 maker,"""Absolutly dreadful"", as Simon would say...my mp3 somehow managed to turn my computer upsidedown and nothing will work. Not only that but the player itself refuses to work while trying to download my first CD on the day I purchased it, it just froze and now all it wants is to be hooked to the computer and its been that way for hours. I am returning it back to Best Buy where I got it.A complete waste of time and money. Not even a single day of it worth while."
4,"With Newer Firmware, Much Better","At first, I was telling people to not buy this product because of the hogging system resources and slow response on the player. Now that the new firmware has (finally) been released, the product is much better.It almost never freezes on me, the response time is much quicker and PC-player sync times are much shorter. The battery life is not much to be praised for, but it lasts around 9-12 hours for me."
1,Pretty bad mp3 player,"I actually went from a Dell jukebox 20GB to this thing. gotta say, it was pretty weak. I loaded it up full from the 2nd day on and maybe this was the problem but I'm not sure why it glitched out on me all the time. I had to buy a 1gb player as a backup to my commute! in any case, you can't edit songs on the player itself, playlists are annoying to edit - but I did love the playlist on the fly function - and the software is like the commodore 64. brutal. I had this thing less than 6 mos and sold it for cheap. never buy this. never."
2,Frustrating: poor quality all around,I must constantly reset the device; the sound quality is sub-par; the processor is slow; the USB/power-cord combo is bulky; works only with Windows Media Player (e.g. not with Rhapsody). Get a Zen Vision instead. Worst $300 I ever spent.
1,My mistake was opening the box,"I too got one as a present. It came from Best Buy. The picture transfer capability doesn't work. I have read all the support info on line and applied it, reloaded the plugin, and repaired the device with the device manager. No pictures.At a similar cost you can buy an 30 GB iPod that will play videos.Save your money and buy a portable FM radio if you need one.It does play the WMA audio, but editing media info in Windows Media Player has been painfully slow."
1,Don't judge a book by it's cover,"If you notice almost all of the good reviews are from people who don't own one or seem to have had one for about 12 hours. Its a pretty little thing, with its slick looking face & touch sensitve buttons and slide. The navigation is ok, which also looks attractive. Everything about it LOOKS great.Thats where it ends. I am on my fourth one because they keep breaking themselves, so thank god I got a 2 year replacement. If you push buttons too fast, it will glitch itself, and you have to use its software to erase everything, and on two of my other ones that didn't even fix it. I have RhapsodyToGo and it doesn't work right now beacuse of it. I don't have the time or energy to list everthing thats wrong with, so do yourself and everyone else a favor: don't buy it. Tell everyone you know not to buy it. Philips should be ashamed of such a piece of junk."
3,Repair it? Forget it.,"we used to love our Phillips MP3 player. Somehow the database became corrupted. The music files were still there but would not show up to select them to play. Phillips own online FAQs for service gave great details for reinstalling the Firmware and had free downloads with an upgrade to the latest firmware. However they DO NOT work on a computer running Windows Vista. Called customer service, they offered no solution, just a sorry for the inconvenience. So shy of spending hundreds on a new computer with a different operating system to fix it, the over $200 MP3 player when new, is now good for the landfill."
1,I'm quite frustrated with this product and Philips,"I got this unit a few months ago and was very pleased at the outset. Though it took me a while to get the songs and my pictures in properly, the ability to have a large part of my music collection with me at all times outweighed the negatives. However, I'm not so pleased anymore. Its happened at least twice now that I power on my unit only to find that all my songs are gone. The unit won't recognize them. Its happened at the most inopportune times, too, right when I'm about to work out and need loud music to take my mind off the pain! The instruction manual was no help, the web site was no help, but more astoundingly, Philips customer service was no help! Like others have said, they seem to have no more knowledge about the products than their customers. This has proven incredibly frustrating. Philips should not be in this market and I, for one, will not buy anything else from them."
3,"Good for music, bad for photos","After having had this player for two weeks, I've just about managed to get to grips with all the idiosyncrasies of transferring music using Media Player. However, I still can't see any of my photo files on the screen, although they are allegedly on the device itself and show up in the Media Player menu. I've reinstalled all the software and still can't get the files to show up. Music-wise this player is quite easy to use and the appearance of the player is pretty cool. It's true that finger marks and smudges show up very easily, but if you breathe on the surface and then rub them out, they disappear fine. The display is good and the battery life ok, though I haven't found it to be near to any of the claimed number of hours. I'm giving it a three out of five, but if anyone can help me with the photo issue, it might end up with a four or greater....."
1,"Bad sound, Ungodly MTP Support","Sound is terrible with every headphone I've tried on it. The included ones, the Etymotic ER4S, the Koss Sporta Pros, 2 versions of the Extreme Isolation Headphones (one 32ohms, one 64ohms) and even some pair of beaters lying around. Harsh, nasty, unpleasant. It never produced any MP3 with anything but a digital, harsh quality to it. I also could not keep it from crashing my machine over and over after installing the MP10 upgrade on the disk and trying to sync it. Don't bother."
1,"Not compatible with Rhapsody, UI shaky","This is a nice concept, badly executed.Despite the claim if being 'PlaysForSure' compatible, it didnt' work with Rhapsody's 'to-go' service. I'm not sure whose end the problem is on, but that's frustrating.The UI is ok, but at times it's slow and lags in response time. The thumb scroll mechanism is sometimes unpredictable and hard to use.The headphones that ship with the unit are defective and only play songs at half-volume -- you'll have to substitute your own. (This wasn't just my unit -- this is true for everyone, I've seen the problem in other reviews.)I would save my money and look elsewhere."
4,Fighting dust 7x24,"Fits well, covers all of the important stuff on the bike. Fights the attack of the dust bunnies 7x24. With the lights off in the garage, in the pitch black, you can't see it at all!"
4,Fits well on my Harley with mini ape bars.,"This cover fits really well on my bike and worked out pretty well. I have a 2006 Harley Dyna with mini ape bars and it fit over them fine. Somehow I melted part of the cover though, so you don't want to throw this on when the bike is hot."
4,Great Cover,"I've paid more for bike covers but this is my favourite. A breeze to get on, good cinches to get it snug, easy to clean up.. Would buy again."
4,Motogear motorcycle dust cover,"I purchased it for my YAMAHA C3 scooter, which is relatively large for a 50cc engine scooter.This product covers the scooter perfectly. But my only complaint is that it's not heat resistant. it melts if you put it directly against a muffler or something very hot. So if you use it, just be careful not to do that."
3,motorcycle dust cover,This cover is about 16 inches to small for my bike.I have a 2008 v-star 650 classic with small saddle bags.The dims for my bike are 96x40x56.I wish the seller would have put some dims in the description.It will sute my needs(not bad fedback about seller)I just don't feel like going thru the hassle of shipping it back.
2,Not a RAIN cover!!!,"Unfortunately, the LARGE size I bought only covers the top half of my bike. (Suzuki gs450 - not a BIG bike) As far as rain is concerned you might as well wrap your bike in towels, as this will be basically the same thing once it's wet."
4,It does the job for a reasonable price,I wanted a no-frills dust cover for just a few bucks. This one fits be bill quite well.Seems durable enough but it looks like it probably would do better in the shade or in a covered parking as it is not as thick and durable as my previous but more expensive one.
2,Don't rely on this text,"Don't rely on this text if you want to pass the exam. The book is difficult to read, and the writer has a tendency to deviate towards performance and architecture issues which are not required for the exam and are likely to waste your time.On a more positive note, it presents some of the basic rules that will be tested on the exam in a concise way and has some very good practice questions.To pass the first exam, I used it to complement the Sybex OCP series, and this worked for me."
1,A waste of money,I can't believe anybody would give more than one star to this awful book. Its not an exam cram it a syntax guide for experienced DBAs'. Its a book written by a man who has only a passing knowledge of the English language and who has no idea how to put across information in an intelligeble way. Don't be fooled by the excellent nature of the other 'exam cram' books. This one is an abberation and should remain out of print forever.
2,Only a few good songs; the rest is crap.,"The use of dialogue from the movie is terrible in one of the tracks -- you can't even hear Ryan Reynolds' monologue. The score tracks are repetitive and only drive home the fact that Ramin Djawadi has no talent. The only good thing about this CD is the packaging, which includes a cool comic book and behind-the-scenes DVD about the making of the score, which never even got a release of its own. What a disaster."
2,Too Complicated,"LeCarre is far to involved in spy terminology to let his readers understand the story he is trying to tell them. Although you eventually get there, it really is'nt worth the ride.I read it when the cold war was in progress. Think what a reader today would make of it."
5,LeCarre and Smiley: men who transcend the genre,"Master sleuth George Smiley, now retired, has a problem. The whole of Britain's intelligence web, and possibly the future of Britain itself, lie uncovered and bleeding from wounds delivered by a British double agent. Smiley must come out of retirement and perform a miracle. The manner in which he attempts to do so, as related by John Le Carre, is no less than a miracle in itself.Le Carre's Smiley novels are masterworks of intricacy, double and triple dealing, subtle and surprising plot twists, and remarkable characterizations at every turn. Smiley and his associates, in London and Hong Kong and Vietman and a brown Italian hillside, are fully-developed characters, as real as their problems.Le Carre's novels are a wondrously complex combination of superior writing and lively plots, grand and memorable treats for the discerning reader.Le Carre has been compared to Dickens once too often; Great Expectations was never this exciting."
4,"Like George Smiley, LeCarre transcends his peers....","Like George Smiley, who is gifted far beyond his peers, John LeCarre's Smiley trilogy is far and away the most literate of the entire genre of cold war espionage thrillers. In fact, these aren't thrillers at all, but finely crafted tales to read for the language, the nuance, and a sensibility largely gone from the world. Particularly fine are the dialog and characters. Perhaps the only other author with as good an ear is cyberpunk author William Gibson."
5,"Fast delivery, book in excellent condition.",The book was like new (as promised by the seller) and reached me in a very timely manner.
3,"Quite deep overview, but statistics...","It's a good book: very good English, it treats quite everything from the point of view of CAUSES! It's full of precise references (good for the thesis!).Expecially good topics: ionization and scintillation detectors; photomultipliers. Lacks: calorimetres and Cerenkov counters! For these topics I suggest: 'Particle Detectors' (many auth.), Cambridge University Press.Just one thing about statistics: you have always to substitute this sentence:''... because of the statistical nature of the process...''with''...because of the uncertainties related to the process, we choose to treat it as statistical...'' OK, it's a bit longer; but are you sure that all advanced physicians know that Caos does not exist as a real entity? It's just a choice of the experimenter to supply lacks in understanding and measuring the process or to simplify it. If you don't believe so, I ask you: why do you make research? Let's talk about it."
5,Want to find out what is going on?...read this book now!,"""Kirael: The Great Shift"" is an extraordinary piece of work. It provides the reader with the insight about personal and planetary changes. Simply put, Kirael and Fred Sterling have gifted us with a message that will change everything we feel and believe in...for the better. It is time to heal, read this book!"
5,"For those seeking a deeper meaning in life, this is a gem.","This is a beautiful work of much love and wisdom coming forth from a spirit guide known as Kirael. He presents a vast amount of exciting information and possibilities on the shift in consciousness which will transform Mother Earth and all Her inhabitants. Kirael encourages us to expand beyond the limitations of our physical realities and to experience our existence through the deeper meaning and higher understanding of the universe. For in this understanding lies the journey of growth and evolution known as ""ascension."" The trinity of truth, trust, and passion becomes our point of reference to the remembrance of love and oneness with the Creator.I've reread the book several times and it has become a source of inspiration. I've also gifted the book to my family and friends to anchor the message of love and healing."
4,The Knife Stands On The White Mountain,"Tresspass is not easy listening album!There is no hits!This is not one of the critics classic Genesis albums!But.... Tresspass has its own pros(ans cons)Looking For Someone, White Mountain and Visions of Angels are force trio. These tracks contains many specific musical details for example. White Mountain's choir ending and Looking For Someone's terrific middle parts including mellotron and flute.Stagnation has just right name because this song sounds perfectly like it. This not favourite part at this album but it is ok. Otherwise, Dusk is something that Genesis would have cut off for this album and would have chosen some other song. The final track called The Knife is one the greatest songs that Genesis have ever made. This nine minute song has all Genesis specialities for exemple. excelent guitar solo, outstanding harmon part, intresting lyrics and good drums.It takes some time to find Tresspass' word but it's worth of listening!"
3,Genesis Steps Forward,"Trespass is Genesis' second album and it marked a nice move forward for the band from their poor debut From Genesis to Revelation. The album contains six lengthy prog-rock numbers that contain the typical mystical lyrics, as Peter Gabriel hadn't yet hit his stride. The music is superb though as the band really tightened up their sound. ""The Knife"" is the best track on the album and is one their best from the Peter Gabriel era. This album isn't an essential Genesis album, but makes for interesting listening to see the progress of the band through the decade."
2,The roots of a band,"If you were farsighted enough to acquire this album when it was first released you are a visionary. If you are a true fan of Genesis, by all means check this out. I am a died in the wool progressive rock fan. Yes, Moody Blues, Jethro Tull, ELP, King Crimson, Genesis; I owned nearly every bit of vinyl they released. If you are a Genesis fan and already have Foxtrot, Lamb Lies Down, Trick of the Tail, Duke and you want to understand where the band came from and you don't have From Genesis To Revelation, buy it before this one. If you have almost the entire collection, and this is the last piece of the puzzle, it's not bad. If you're not steeped in Genesis, there are better places to spend your dime. I really enjoy Genesis but this is not the most interesting music they ever produced. When this album was released it was very much ahead of it's time; however IMO the creativity in some of their later albums exceedes the Trespass album."
3,3 1/2 stars and a sense of things to come,"A very good debut for what we would eventually come to know as the classic Genesis sound. Even without the contributions of future bandmates Steve Hackett and Phil Collins, this album stands on its own. Worth listening to, especially for the tracks Visions of Angels, Stagnation, and The Knife."
3,The shape of things to come,"Had Trespass been the only album Genesis ever released it would stand out as a cult masterpiece. However compared to what would come later Trespass comes across as uneven. Side one sees the music outpacing the lyrics, which at points sound like junior varsity Tolkien. Side two, however, is what makes Trespass. Stagnation/Dusk/The Knife can almost be treated as one piece. Anthony Phillips and Michael Rutherford's guitar work on Stagnation is staggering in it's beauty. The guitar (Phillips), piano (Anthony Banks), and flute (Peter Gabriel) interplay on Dusk is moving. And finally the rousing tour de force of The Knife brings the piece to a thundering close. Side two alone makes Trespass worth the purchase !"
3,The real true first Genesis album,"This album is the second but should be considered as the first release of the band. With this one, the band was free to explore and create, this was not what happened with their first release.From Genesis to Revelation)All the tracks are good but not great. Real close to Nursery Cryme in my opinion. If you like old Genesis lie Nursery Cryme or Foxtrot, you should own this CD."
5,This is beautiful!,"I used to have this little gem on 8track, and haven't heard it in quite some time. I played the samples on this site, and it all came back to me. Although, I do own Archive,vol.I, which includes ""Stagnation,"" and ""Dusk""(my personal ""Trespass"" favorite), the whole thing in context is a very under-rated piece of work. To me, it has sentimental value, and I would recommend this to any serious person who isn't sure whether or not to acquire it."
4,this album rocks!,"just kidding, of course it doesn't rock but it is uniquely lovely as are most genesis records. for some reason i find this more haunting than the others although selling england and the lamb are probably better overall. it is great to hear tony on just the piano and organ without all the later ornamentation and peter's reverbed flute sounds beautiful, especially stagnation. also the group vocals on dusk are something they didn't seem to do that much but it sounds great here.it's a simpler record than others (nursery, foxtrot) and it works. a personal favorite."
1,Artistic Techniques for Perfect Makeup,"I was greatly disappointed after viewing this video. Although the title promises a lot, you won't learn anything about the make up. This VHS lasts about 15 minutes, it shows an author of this tape applying make up ONLY on herself and advertising her own line of color cosmetics. There are no tips, tricks or techniques shown. This video is useless - if you really want to learn something about make up I'd suggest you buy Hollywood Make up Magic VHS"
2,Mediocre Found-Footage Film,"Amityville Haunting is another basic found-footage horror film. A new family moves into the house and begin experiencing supernatural events; the events are capture by Luke, the son, and home security cameras. The acting ranges from terrible to mediocre; the scenes where Luke talks to himself are very bad and sound incredibly forced. There are only a few good scares, while most scares fell flat for me. The ending was simply okay. It claims to be real footage, but it obviously isn't. It really doesn't impress or try anything new at all, you've seen this movie before.By the way, there is some nudity and sex at the beginning of the film and only a little blood. Save your money, I caught it on Netflix Streaming (available as of 6/21/12) and definitely wouldn't recommend paying for it."
1,Zero stars,This is one of the worst movies ever made.Why can't I rate it zero stars? Is there a negative star option?
2,Geoff Meed could have used the ROCK !,"Okay,So we have beat this Amityville ghost horse to death !Stop with all the ghost documentaries and Paranormal Entity 3 references.Now,Yes,This effort has good points in suspense and shows some acting on the leads part.Erin Marie Hogan, Who is not the daughter this time around,Built a career on Paranormal Activity nude scenes.Bill Oberst ,Jr. played the sheriff in A Haunting In Salem and just has a look,None of which is here.Feel bad there wasnt much to love about this effort,Maybe Asylum just needed a break from all its Disaster/SyFy/Giant monsters ?Geoff Meed did direct it and has done some wonderful work elsewhere."
2,Not scary at all. Rips off Paranormal activity,"This was tolerable for a while. The kids were the better performers here, while the guy playing the husband is just plain bad. This is an unnecessary story of a house that is supposed to be the one in Amityville but isn't, and it's many years later. This movie tries very hard to rip off Paranormal activity but without the creepy factor necessary to sustain it."
4,a good star trek book,Michael Jan Friedman writes some of my favorite books including Kahless. He has done a good job providing insights on Romulan culture.
2,pro classic trek,"This book had a very interesting premise. I was looking forward to reading a mingling of the Classic Trek and TNG universes. I was very disappointed. I am an avid TNG fan who also likes Classic Trek. There's a subtle, but continual, pro-Classic Trek theme throughout the book. I was disappointed that the author felt he had to diminish TNG and its characters, to pay tribute to Classic Trek. If you are a Classic Trek fan, undoubtedly, you'll like this book and its implications. However, if you're a TNG fan, you'll be turned off by its slightly negative take on TNG."
3,An average Friedman novel,"Michael Jan Friedman never appealed to me. The only good story of his was ""Reunion."" This is no exception. The plot is great, but McCoy is horrible. Scotty is...well...not really Scotty. Spock is the only person who is halfway resembling himself. Plus, like all Friedman novels, the story is just...unbelieveable. I wouldn't buy this book."
2,One of Mike Friedman's worst!,"The inclusion of McCoy and Scotty on this book is nothing more than a gimmick to attract fans to buy it. As a result, the Next Gen crew is only given a secondary plotline. For a better book by Friedman, read 'Kahless' or 'Requiem' (Star Trek TNG #32)."
4,This was a very good novel.,"I believe that this is a very good novel. This is because that Friedman did a spetacular job at combing that characters from TNG and TOS, Even though some of the characterization and events were a little over the top and some event would not happen if Star Trek was real. These included the bridge of the Enterprise on the Yorktown and McCoy believing he can solve the situation by pulling rank."
2,"""-I- AM SPOCK-TACUS!""","You can bet that if Peter David had lifted a cliche as hoary as the ""I am Spartacus"" moment for one of his stories, he would have at least given a nod to his source! Spock as messiah became fairly tedious, as did the rehash of 'old codger from OST becoming a liability and then proving himself' plot line from RELICS. Dry, humorless, with action scenes that lead nowhere and a seemingly superficial grasp on what makes the characters tick. I just don't get why Mr. Friedman is so popular. I've been so pleased with the overall improvement in the ST fiction offerings in the last few years - Kevin Ryan, Peter David, Greg Cox and others have all been able to incorporate and expand the dimensions of the trek universe with wit, heart and intelligence. Like another reviewer here, I keep trying to like this author's books since he is so prolific, but damn it, Jim, Star Trek fiction should never be a chore!"
5,Big Boom,This subwoofer adds another dimension to my theater sound system. It truly delivers a solid punch!!
3,Yamaha YST-SW216BL Subwoofer,"It's a bit bulky, and the dimensions as a cube make it a bit difficult to place in a concealed area. Appearance aside, once I synched it with my receiver, the sound and added bass is terrific. I am also using a pair of Polk R-15 front speakers, and the subwoofer is a fantastic compliment."
5,Return to home music after 12 years on road & stuff.,"Bought this as a low-cost if not lowest cost unit I could find at the time Jan.2012..Paired up with new Marantz 7.1 at first so-so kick. Read about some other peoples brands and discussions on other sites , set my fronts to small spkr. designation and ___BAM!!!!!!Set cut over at 40hz on main amp and now you get that "" turn that S______t Dooown"" Scream ,just like the good old days of Pure Pwr. Amps. Remember the neighbor downstairs hitting their ceiling with the broom handle & yelling , __Yup__ , that's the sound now! Check your Mfg. owners manual.Like ""ZENAGIN's "" review said "" spend some time dialing in"", Thanks Zenagin,TX.Space is about 16 ft. X 30 ft. one is working fine w/o sattilites, may go for two , then add 4 satt. speakers to 2 Subs.Fine, that will be just___ fine."
5,Great Value,"A great buy midsize Subwoofer for the price!. I had the same size another brand which burned out, for replacement, I would of cost over $225."
4,Excellent subwoofer for the price,"I purchased this subwoofer to complete my home theatre system and am very pleased with it. Keep in mind that this is not ""top of the line"". I paid somewhere in the neighborhood of $1000 for the entire system including Yamaha a/v receiver, 4 Yamaha surround sound inceiling speakers, a Yamaha center speaker, and this subwoofer.The bass is full and with the internal power supply it can be boosted to suit your taste.Overall, for the money, this is a great choice."
3,OK sub,I;d go for the Polk PSW10 if I had it to do over. Much tighter sound for about the same money. This one is just a little boomie.
4,Good sound for a low end sub-woofer,"I bought this to go along with my Yamaha receiver. This is not your ""poweful sub"" but for movies watching, it is very good for the price range. This sub does not have auto on/off mode but if you hook up to plug it to your ""receiver"", the power will be turn on or off with your amp. The sound is clean and the styling is elegant. This sub is not as slim as some may like since it is squared. My movies experience is much better now with this new sub."
4,Strong Subwoofer for the price!,The YST-SW216BL performs flawlessly with a full bass in rooms of moderate size. It is priced very competively and carries Yamaha quality.
5,Very Good Company,"My product came very fast,great product. I have ordered from this online site before, and have had great sucess. Very happy"
4,above average,"I use this as a part of my left-right television system. It works great on music and movies alike. I had a phasing issue which I was able to resolve with plugging it mono, but I wish it had a phase reverse function. I also wish it had an auto-on sensing feature so I don't have to keep it on all the time."
4,surprising little sub,"I have had several subs over the years costing several hundred dollars each, but thanks to my ex-wife I needed a new sub and the budget was a bit tight. I decided to give the yamaha a try, but wasn't expecting to much from it. boy was I surprised this little thing thumps quite well. Not good tight bass for music, but great for movies. If your looking for a budget sub this is the one!"
5,What a sub for a reasonable price!,I purchased this sub based on customer reviews....and they were right it makes an unbelievable addition to your system!
4,Fabulous Performance,You will enjoy its presence and performance. Great addition to my sound system. I recommend it to your new system.
2,Horrible sub for music way to MUDDY,I bought this sub because of all the reviews but when i got it and plugged it in its sounds like a piece of crap. The bass is wayyyy to muddy. If you like deep bass in your music this sub is NOT for you. It looks like a well be selling this sub
4,More than sufficient for my need.......,"For tight, non-overpowering bass this subwoofer works great for my Denon stereo shelf system. I am not an audiophile but the size, setup and looks-combined with the sound of this subwoofer, not to mention the affordability leaves me entirely satisfied. The only drawback is it is not auto-switching but I leave it on continuously and have no problems with this. Living in a condo demands some consideration for my neighbors but even at low levels the bass is crisp,concise, and additive."
5,Boom boom pow,"That title for this is the name of the song by Black eyed peas that I use to wake up my teenagers at noon. This subwoofer shakes the walls enough that they just fall out of bed. But the real reason I got it was for the surround sound during movies. It makes the inhome movies much scarier and you DO pay attention more to the action. Even the commercials use subwoofer sound to enhance their music and action, which is unheard by most people. The sound is very clean, no scratch, buzz, hiss, rumble. Glad I didn't spend more."
4,Great subwoofer for high-end video systems,"If you are going to get a high-end television sound is going to be as important a consideration as video. For my newMitsubishi LT-46149 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with Integrated Sound Projectorit was pretty obvious that good sound is offered.But having a great LCD HDTV might not be enough. Mitsubishi recommended this powered subwoofer for its set. And it is a good recommendation.The Yahama subwoofer adds real dimension to the ""Sound Projector"" (essentially a high end surround processor). Without the subwoofer the Sound Projector performed quite well in my living room. Adding the subwoofer provided life-like sound environments that were well beyond my high expectations."
4,Great sound,We bought a surround sound system but the subwoofer was inadequate so we replaced it with this powered subwoofer. It has great sound and was just what we needed to give our sound system the rich base it needed. Well worth the price.
4,Yamaha subwoofer yst-sw216bl,I have to agree with the other reviews on this product. It works great in a smaller room giving you tons of bass. When I put it in my living room roughly 26x18 it still performed nicely. It doesn't give you the big boomy bass but I wasn't looking for that being a movie fanatic. It provides nice low sounding bass way below that of my bose front speakers. This is worth the $89 I paid for it. Only thing I didn't like was it didn't come with a Rca plug. Also you have to turn it off manually. I think next time I will look for one with a remote.
3,Really low end,It did well for some Home Theater In-a-Box speakers i had and marginally well with a pair of really good bookshelfs but when I upgraded to a set of Infinty Primus towers and bookshelfs it just sucked. It's underpowered for anything other than really low end speakers...but it that's all you have then it will be better than nothing and that's why I gave it 3 stars. Don't pay more than 100 bucks for this. I got it for 89 shipped around christmas and it's not worth more than that.If you have a good set of speakers or just about any kind of tower forget this sub.--Mike
5,What a deal!,Wow! What a difference this will make for your home theater system and for a fraction of the cost! I am very pleased. I received it as a Christmas present. It is my favorite and not the most expensive gift.
4,a great percussion ensemble,"The four men on this recording are no doubt four of the most influential drummers in jazz. milford graves and andrew cyrille have been acredited before with revolutionizing free jazz, polyrythmic drumming. kenny clarke was a huge figure in the hard bop and post bop periods of jazz. and don moye, best known for his work with the Art Ensemble of Chicago, is a true innovator of percussion instruments. These musicians were all very big in the sixities, they were also influenced by the times. Black Nationalism played a large part in the lives of these musicians in the sixties and African drumming techniques are very evident in their playing. the music is heartfelt (definitely heard in the singing/chanting of Graves and Moye.) a great record for lovers of the drums, people interested in African influence on jazz, and a must for any fan of the drummers."
5,"thebig""D""","I don't currently have this book, but I have owned it in the past. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.com. The feelings that this book brings up is unexplainable. I used to read it to my 2 month old and he really seemed to pay attention. My son later died and this book feels like a special ""thing"" between he and I. I think anyone who reads it to there little baby will find it just as touching."
5,A great treatment of a difficult text.,"One of my favorite all around commentaries (applications to the contemporary world, depth, scholarship etc.). Used this book as a basis for a full semester graduate class on Ezekiel. Good treatment of the text critical issues without pushing too many varied and conflicting view points that tend to generate more heat than light. Good bibliography for leading you to more specific studies. Very little original language work here so if you are not a fan of Hebrew, no worries there. If you're looking for an excellent treatment of Ezekiel from someone with a conservative view of Scripture, look no further. Wright is a great scholar with a mission heart (see his book ""The Mission of God;"" also excellent). Thus, he understands that theology must live and breathe else it is a waste of time."
2,Too much! Too much!,"Sorry to say, this is not one of the better volumes in this series. It is about twice as long as it needs to be: wordy, rambling, and pompously didactic.The entire series (""The Message of ..."") is directed at the more general student of the Bible. It stays away from highly technical textual crtiticsm, aiming instead at the lay reader who just needs a little help with context, imagery, etc. Some volumes of the series are excellent in this respect. This is just not one of them.The author successfully avoids the technical and scholarly emphasis, but falls right off the other side of the mountain by letting his generalized ""preachiness"" quite run away with him.The end result is that the reader must filter through a great deal of extraneous vaporizing to get to the meat of Ezekiel."
2,"Great music, poorly reproduced","What should have been a treasure for lovers of Preservation Hall Jazz Band is disappointing for the low resolution of the video and awful audio reproduction. I played it once, then put it into the box of stuff going to the Salvation Army."
4,Low use but high potential,Haven't used this much but it has high hopes. My wife and I are just getting into homemade pasta so it will take time to get much out of this. So far though it has been quite valuable.
5,compact pasta rack,"very nice well made pasta rack,the best part is the design which folds up easily for storage when not in use.We liked it so much we bought our daughter one."
5,Marcato Pasta drying rack,"It serves the purpose of drying freshly made pasta very well. Since it has many spokes it can handle a whole batch of pasta. it is also very stable & does not take up much space to store. I am really glad I bought it, though it is a bit pricey for what it does."
4,Lots of space,"There are so many sticks to put pasta on, can dry alot more then most other racks. Sturdy and easy to store."
5,Perfect for a lot of pasta,The folding design is perfect for storage. And it holds a lot more pasta than traditional racks. Very sturdy. I'm glad I paid for money for this superior rack.
5,great for same day use pasta,"Great for hanging and drying pasta you plan on using the same day as cooking. For long term stored pasta, it's better to create dried nests or sheets on tea towels, so they will fit in your containers and not have an odd curved breaking point."
4,"Bigger and Nicer Than ""Plastic"" Would Indicate, Still Expensive","It's bigger than the picture might indicate, but folds up pretty nicely, and the feet are of higher quality than you might imagine. Still, I might have ordered the $10 wooden legs if I had known it didn't fold up more compactly, but no doubt this will work better. Worth about $20-30, not the $40 they charge here, in my opinion."
4,Firmly in the top 10% of all Star Trek novels,"[Review written Nov 2004]This is one of the earliest Star Trek novels, and still ranks among the best in the genre. It's a fast no-frills read, weighing in at only around 225 pages, and the story involves murder, intrigue, theoretical physics and a classic time travel & save-the-universe type plot ... a theme that has since been mined nearly to death by a host of imitators over the past 20+ years.By today's standards, it's a bit short, and I wished the authoress had spent more time exploring some of the interesting new characters she introduces, and not rushed the plot along quite so quickly ... but it's still an enjoyable read.It's one of the few books in my Star Trek collection that's on my periodic rereading rotation."
4,The Entropy Effect,"As with most of McIntyre's novels, this book is well detailed and researched. She maintains the reader's interest with many nail-biting situations infused with the humor that is frequently found in the relationships between the major characters. I very much enjoyed the book and had a difficult time putting it down."
2,OKAY,"tHIS PRODUCT IS ABIT MONOTONOUS. I DONT LIKE THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR FASHIONS ARE REALLY NICE. i DONT REALLY LIKE THE BRATZ BOYS COZ THEY LOOK ABIT MATURE FOR THEIR AGE!"
4,"Yasmin, one of the cutest girls!","Since the early release of these dolls, I never actually saw the doll itself.All I did see was the ""Sluttiness"" behind it all. How they encourage young girls to be cheap prostitutes.But recently I came across some ""Rebirthed"" Bratz dolls, and saw how wonderful these things can come up if done up appropriately!MOST of the outfits these dolls come with are very inappropriate for young children, however, I guess it's up to the child's parents to ""Dictate"" what thier child is exposed to....Since seeing these dolls for what they CAN be, I think they are indeed very cute, and I love the fact they come with thier hair done up. Unlike dolls when I was younger....My daughter has also taken a liking to these cute little dolls, but unlike some negligent parents, I won't be allowing her to dress it in ""Slutty"" outfits!"
2,Yyuuuk,"First of all, this doll's feet are a different colour from her legs. Gross. Then, you tend to lose her feet, so she goes around with just little leg stumps. Gross. Huge head, tiny body, kind of like those anorexic Hollywood actresses (Katie Holmes, Calista Flockhart, etc) who are so scrawny their heads look huge. Not something I want my daughter to emulate, thank you very much. Thanks, I'll try another range of dolls."
3,FUN!,Hi i'm Emily. I don't know if this doll is bad or not. My friend has it & we love to play with it. My mom got me Dana & Jade but I really want Yasmin. She says i'm to young for the Yasmin doll. I don't know why? I have sun kissed summer Dana & Jade & my mom says i'm not to young for them. I don't understand. They all have on bikinis. Yasmin is just about the same as the others. I just don't get it.
5,BEST TOY EVER!!! ^_^,"When I saw my friends all playing with bratz I though hey that looks like fun, so I bought my first yasmin doll and i had an absoulute blast playing and having fun. I diffently recommend bratz dolls to children, because they arefun and enjoying, there fun to play with and shouldn't sit on a shelf, these dolls are even better than barbie in my opion! I love all the varities the bratz creaters let you choose from and they are always making new bratz dolls, buy bratz dolls there fun and cool and probrably will never go out of style!"
3,TOO SKIMPY!,Bratz are great but Yasmin is wearing a skimpy swim suit. Thanks alot to whoever designed this this has now made my 6 year old daughter dress like a skimpy person. This really does influence children to go out & wear bikini swimsuits that are to old for them. I think If a doll is going to have on a swim suit at least eradicate the bikini! Buy the ones that don't have on bikini's!...!
5,THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!!,Anyone who likes anything will like this game! You get to blow a bunch of stuff up and hijack a bunch of robots!
4,Great Fun,"I first saw a preview to this game on G4 and thought it might be something fun. Then i see it downpriced to 20 bucks and had to have it. Best 20 i ever spent. If you like fast paced shooters with lots of destuction this ones for you. The verbal banter of the bots is an added charm to a great 3rd person perspective shooter. With names like Glitch, Hosed and Screwed these are some fun robots. At 42 single player levels, it is an even better bargain for the bucks."
3,It is a fairly good game and a wise move if you liked MDK,"I'm going to keep it short and simple. It is a good game, great graphics, nice sound, good control response, yet the aiming leaves a lot be desire!. The game has not auto aim or lock on, which makes shooting any thing, while you are running, very difficult. In the demo you get a several weapons, although only a very few are actually useful. I'm assuming the full version will have a lot more to choose from plus the upgrades. The gameplay reminded me a lot of MDK 2, yet the aiming falls quite short and it hurts the fun factor BIG TIME. I would recommend you rent it first, or buy it second hand. Never the less it is a very good game."
4,Pay Attention!,"So Far it looks like people love, or hate this game, I mean really everyone has given it a 5 excet a couple of people who brag about how great this game is then they forget to put stars. You're hurting this great game."
4,T's review,This game is cool I like Krunk especially because he says many funny things. You can also kick some mil @$$.
1,Avoid Like The Plauge,"This game SUCKS! The controls are horrible and don't work when I want Glitch to do something. The graphics belong to game systems that were around before PS1.(My friend acually has one of them.) The characters do curse, but when they say the F-word they beep it out so it sounds like, ""Fu-BEEP-ing"". If they're going to curse, just curse! I don't know why the game designers put it in, and if it's for humor, it's not funny, just stupid. The games story is probably the worst I've ever heard. A science project gone ary, a scientist goes missing, the science experiment becomes a general, starts a group of robots. Meanwhile, the scientist starts a rebellion. All these reasons are probably why no one knows or buys this game. To the people reading this review, this games retarded and avoid it like the plauge."
1,Filthy Language,The game seemed ok but the fowl language in the game made it unacceptable for a childrens game. Got rid of it before my kids ever had a chance to play. If the game makers insist on such language they need to offer a way to disable that part in the form of parental controls.
4,"Metal Arms, Great game","Excellent game for 20 bucks. Reminds me alot of the Transformers game, though the graphics and AI aren't as good. The variety of weapons and the ability to jack into other bots and control them is great. Definately worth picking up for 20 bucks."
2,unacceptable for gaming,"30ms pixel response is much too slow for 3d action games. there is noticable blur when strafing left and right on every game i tried with this lcd. also, it does lighting effects poorly, creating an unrealistic looking circular halo around lights. i am returning this display and getting a 19in viewsonic G90FB-2. if you are a serious gamer, do not buy an lcd. period."
5,"great quality picture, beautiful display","I just upgraded to this LCD from a not-so-great 17"" CRT. I must say that I'm more than mildly impressed. The picture shown (even the larger one) does not do this monitor justice. The screen size is just incredible and the quality is even better. I had no bad pixels and it was ready to go out of the box (would have been nice to come with a DVI cable though).Other reviews complain about the controls being complicated and hard to see. But really, how much do you need to use them? Just by testing them for a matter of minutes, I was able to figure them out without problem and they're easy enough to remember their location. And hopefully, once you get it set the way you want it, you shouldn't have to change too much.Oh, and if you're on the DVI cable, games are just fine. If you're using just VGA into this thing, the quality will be blurry, DVI is a MUST for games with this display.Overall, excellent purchase and great deal (under $500)."
2,Good text - lousy illustrations,"The text of this book is fine - as expected. Somewhat old-style, but legible. The pictures, illustrations, etc, on the other hand are mainly just black squares and/or illegible. Quality of the production is awful. Looks like it has been photocopied 10,000 times."
3,Earthly dull,"As opposed to the unearthly stuff most people who would be searching for Tesla books are actually interested in. If you want to wind coils for old-fashioned electric motors, alternators and inductors, this is the book for you! Unfortunately for those interested in extraterrestrial influences and transmitting electrical power through the ether, this book represents the real science and inventions that made Tesla a true success in his day, as opposed to the kookier speculations that later fertilized his legend. Because it dispells myths, I have given it three stars for performing a real service. But unless your are deeply interested in the history of alternating current, you don't have to spend [money] for a paperweight."
2,"Many issues are addressed, while the solutions are thin.","The author does a fine job of identifying where conflict exists and all the negative problems associated with this environment. Based on the title, I kept waiting for the ""magic bullets"" tor counteract our current argumentative culture. All nine chapters focused on the problem areas, while only two pages were dedicated to a sub-chapter titled ""Moving From Debate To Dialogue.""I felt the book was too negative and provided few true alternatives to the ""Argument Culture."""
2,The Argument Culture,The book itself was used for a class project. I found the cultural perspective somewhat stilted. I think that the author could have been more culturally astute in her presentation of the differences between cultures when individuals within are in conflict. And she totally avoided the issue of racism in the argument.
2,Disappointing - My last Tannen book.,"Oh, so disappointing. Kind of like a WHO album. You know ""same old song with different lines"". A lengthy book that basically rearranges much of what she has already written. Not enough new or ground breaking information. Sorry, Dr. Tannen you may have ridden this horse too long!"
1,Read Plato instead,"If you want to converse about argument, debate, shared insight, sophistry, truth, beauty, and the American way, etc., don't bother with this dreck. Just read any Platonic dialogue."
5,Everybody should read this book,"I wish this book could made required reading for everyone who listens to the media, watches TV news, votes, raises a family, or expresses an opinion. Tannen explains a large part of why our nation is in so many messes we are unable to deal with intelligently. She absolutely nails the problem. You'll never look at things the same way again."
4,Interesting... Worth reading,"I am a debate coach from Colorado. When I first started reading the book, my first impression was that her arguments were poorly supported. She seemed to use more senarios than actual facts. As I began to move on though, she started backing up what she was saying with more constructive arguements. I thought that her views where a bit misguided, as it gave the impression that debate is our problem. Debate is a very useful tool, and when it is used well, it can, and many times is, the best form of communication. It weeds out the the bad arguements and statements so only the the truth is left standing. She made debate sound too much like a negative thing. She did have some good points though, and it was a very interesting book."
3,good book but needs to be updated,So this is a good book and it tells you the history of Heroin but the book needs to be updated and some of the facts are wrong because they book has not been updated. But its a good read but don't use this book as a source for a term paper
4,Nice clinical guide,"In my opinion, this manual is a really good clinical guide for therapists that are already acquainted with the kinesio taping method. It describes some techniques in step-by-step way and it also brings some associations of the kinesio taping method with other taping techniques. However, I must say that I've expected more about the book material and lay-out of the components, since it is black and white. Even though, I must say that these considerations do not make it difficult to read and understand it. I recommend!"
1,Double the price,"This book is double the price here, look else where and you will find it for less than $33."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This company has a very strict return policy on books and other merchandise. If you purchased it, you can't return it. The book quality is poor. All the pictures are in black and white which makes it very difficult to follow the techniques used."
1,"Great Book, Ripoff Price!!!!!","DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK UNTIL YOU CHECK THE PRICES ELSEWHERE!!!!! I initially thought I was getting a good deal (I even told the seller so in their review) as the book is very informative and full of illustrations. It is an excellent book and I would recommend it. However, now after searching the web, I found that this exact same book is some for $32.95 EVERYWHERE else. I should not have bought this book the first place I saw it. I feel like I have been robbed. I feel so stupid for not checking the prices, I know the prices on amazon are pretty competitive so i didnt bother. This price is more than double ANYWHERE else. If I didn't get anything else out of this experience, I got a lesson in shopping around first before you let your excitement lead you to make a bad purchase."
5,A great resource for anyone using this therapy,"I keep this book with me at all times and it's a great resource with decent black & white pictures - a must for any doc, resident or student using this therapy."
5,Happy Memories!,This was a fun gift to give my 40 year old daughter reminding her of the book when she was a youngster. We're glad some things never change!
3,It's good but not a great update this time,"I've been faithfully buying each Illustrator WOW! Book since they came out and am generally pleased with the amount of content covering the new release. I can't say the same for the CS version of this book. I was a bit underwhelmed with the focus they put on the 3D features. Nothing really WOWed me and I felt I could find the same examples and information via the Adobe site.On the other hand, if you're just starting out with Illustrator and have a good understanding of the basics, this is a good book to get for a look into seeing what most of the tools and commands can do."
3,A Little Jumpy,"The ideas and concepts in this book are excellent. However, there is a significant amount of redirection...if you like, this look in this chapter, or we'll see more on this later in this chapter. Combined with the many sidebars and tips, the overall effect is a little distracting, and gets in the way of some very valuable information and concepts."
4,Great for a quick reference,This book is good for quick and easy to understand guide in Adobe Illustrator CS. (Not a quick guide for people who know Adobe Photoshop.) The reference to the tools are very helpful. Tutorials are very straight forward. There are images through out the books. Great buy.
2,This Book is Not for Novices -- Too Complicated,"I am an Adobe Certified Photoshop user and member of the NAPP (National Association of Photoshop Professionals - http://www.photoshopuser.com) and a self-taught designer. So, I pick up things pretty quickly. However, I am a novice when it comes to Illustrator. This book is HORRIBLE for beginners. The complete lack of detail for the lessons is terrible. The author should stick to design and forget about teaching and writing books. It is difficult to find quality Illustrator CS books and this is definately not one of them. Stick to the Adobe Classroom in a Book series - even though their Illustrator CS books has some errors to it. I gave this book 2 stars only because it has great art in it. It was not for the quality of the lessons. This book sucks."
2,"Sleep through the first one, Watch the Brain","Ho hum I watched the Beach Girls and the Monster and I, yes I who love old Sci Fi classics and campy movies can't remember much. Terrible, but not terrible in a good way like ""The Brain from Planet Arous"" which is a must have for collectors of the old campy, drive-in or Sci Fi movies. Yes you can really see the string on the brain towards the end of the film. So, 2 stars since the beach girls are worth 0 and the brain is worth 4."
3,"Dated, but still funny...","I find the videos to be a little dated, but there are still a few classic parodies that I love. The hard part in getting this is, in some cases, without knowing the original ad the parody isn't quite as funny.If you remember the early SNL skits (Like the Buddwesier Ice Hockey ad with Robin Williams and Joe Piscopo... my favorite) and want to remember some of them ... this is the tape for you.I you are just looking for something funny and aren't familiar with the older SNL skits ... I would look for something else."
5,The funniest book I've read in ages,"I read an article about this book in an Entertainment Weekly (I believe). Being a fan of movies, I bought it not knowing what to expect. I'm so glad I did!By the end of the book, the party guests seemed like old friends to me. What makes this book great is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a bunch of friends sitting around and watching movies we all know (and love to hate).Reading this book is like being a fly on the wall. It's the perfect read for you voyeurs, movie fans and/or people wanting to laugh-out-loud. I read it on the train to and from work and found my self stifling laughter constantly (my shaking no doubt alarmed quite a few fellow commuters).After finishing this book, I read Misadventures in the (213) - another hilarious book. I'm waiting for Screening Party II - may I suggest screening parties for Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory? Mommie Dearest? Pillow Talk? Forrest Gump?"
5,HILARIOUS!,"great fun. if you're not rolling on the floor with laughter when you read this your first name is ebenezer. several friends get together and critique movies. no one is spared when they carve up such cinematic masterpieces as st. elmo's fire, the bodyguard, glitter, basic instinct, pretty woman [ I don't understand julia roberts popularity, eric got the talent gene, imo ], my favorite is the chapter on the movie cruising."
2,A little overpriced.,"I own this DVD, and was looking into buying another copy for a friend. I see it's selling here for nearly $1000. All I can say is, you have got to be kidding. This DVD is still selling new for around $25 and I don't think first edition DVD's are worth nearly as much as books. I would say, buy any other yoga DVD for a reasonable price (between $18 and $25 seems about average.) Tias Little is an okay instructor but there are boatloads of other ashtanga yoga teachers on DVD who are far more worth it. I've seen price manipulating going on elsewhere in the yoga and new age markets and don't approve."
3,Where is the rest,"I recorded this from TV on vcr as well. Just Dug it up. Wow, I notice this is missing some extra tunes they did after Tommy. As, You better you bet, My substitute, Who are you, Behind blue eyes, Won't get fooled again. All done by the 3 remainer members without the other quest early in the video. This part that's not included on this DVD would have rounded this out. Sorry I'll pass on this, and just transfer what I have to my own dvd. I have to edit the TV ads from 89 out. (those are even classics now, Eagle Talon, 21 jump street, AT&T phone booth ad, etc). Thanks"
4,Pleasure to read. Mr. Penick is an inspiration!,"Every chapter is a different lesson. It can be read and re-read. Mr. Penick has so many experiences to share. Funny, inspiring, a real joy! Great gift!"
3,Oops! It's not a book!,"The item looked good--just like new. It came promptly, no complaints. Only problem was that it was not a book, but rather a casette tape! Must have been my mistake, but I question how well marked it is when it's mixed in with all the books for sale. Anyway, luckily my girlfriend has an older car with a casette player! My bad! Avoid the same mistake...."
5,Definitely for all golfers!,I wanted to know who Harvey Penick was and what he did for the game of golf. I was not disappointed.
4,"Not a ""How to Book."" Great for those needing inspiration.","Some readers who wrote reviews wrote ""nothing new"" etc. Let me give it to you straight up. This book is not a how to get rich book. Those that are are actually working towards their goals know that. This book is ensightful. It ""does"" have a lot of quotes in it from some of the greatest thinkers this world has ever seen. That is the real benefit. If you like Brian Tarcy, Steven Covey, John C. Maxwell, even Donald Trump you will like this book. It is for true thinkers that are able to read between the lines, not too much for the ""get rich quick"" crowd."
1,"Same stuff, different book....","Nothing new here, folks. All this book does is give page after page of quotes from other writers of books on spirituality (James Allen, Lenedra Carroll, Eckhart Tolle,etc..) as well as other historical figures. The rest is just a bunch of his, hazy at best, personal experiences. The level of this book can best be pinpointed by relaying one of his ""keys"": ""Work smarter, not harder""The constant advertisments to purchase the above mentioned author's books also became very tiresome."
1,HaHa...I hope no one paid for this!,"I got the audio book free from the library and I still paid too much! This has got to be one of the weakest books about becoming a millionaire. Nothing really informative. Just a rehash from others, Marc slinging books he's published and boring anecdotes about his life. Hey, if you gained anything from this then more power to ya."
2,Not What I Thought It Would Be,"There are very few insights here and what readers are left with only a New Age viewpoint that does not fit in the real business world. The book does go into some detail about how he made his money in the publishing business, but that was some 30 years ago. I don't see how this message is relevant today, especially in the high-tech world we live in today. Pass on this on."
1,A Disappointment,"There is no information here that will teach you how to be a millionaire. All there is really are just stories and thoughts from Marc Allen. Mr. Allen says that he is not a Type A personality, but a Type Z. In other words he admits he is a lazy person and says that he has his employees do most, if not all of the work for his company. Show me a millionaire who thinks like this and I will show you a millionaire that will not be a millionaire for long. Most successful business people are actively involved in their businesses and know what the meaning of the word work is. Mr. Allen's message is one that says luck is okay and so is sloth, but in today's sluggish economy this message is for the birds!"
1,The Joke Is On The Reader,Some of the passages in this book are hard to believe. Marc Allen says that he never yells at anyone and for anyone to yell at his company is grounds to be dismissed. Gee what happen to the Bill Gates management style. Let the emotions roll baby and make money. Allen's view seems ridiculous to me and I am sorry I bought it! I did not learn a thing. Hope I am speaking softly--ha
1,Cool Idea But Bad Writing,"The idea of this book is rather good, but the writing was tuff to get through. There is really no rhyme or reason to the text and the reader is left wondering at times what exactly the author is talking about. Also, there is no proof given in the book for the author's success. He claims he is rich, but the reader would not know this just by reading the book. Because of this I had doubts about many of the author's claims in the book. There is a dark cloud of uncertainty surrounding the work that leads me to think that some sections of the book are pure make believe. This would be a better book for fiction or fantasy than non-fiction."
1,A Good Paperweight,"After reading some of the reviews here on Amazon.com about this book, I bought it and I am sorry I did. What a load of nonsense. The positive reviewers are no doubt members of the author's family because I can think of no other explanation for their opinions. There is nothing new about the material that one could not find in a zillion other business books. The author seems like he is in a meditative haze for most of the book and clearly has proven that he is an empty and hollow writer that deserves only to be dismissed and quickly forgotten."
4,Practical at a high level.,"I may have a slight different perspective on this book since I've only listened to the audio version of it. One thing you have to remember is that this book was written as a ""Visionary Plan""; it is by no means an in depth, step-by-step process on how to become a millionaire. The ideas Marc discusses are intended to be practical approaches to disciplining your mind, setting goals, and realizing our full potential. Much of the book tends to focus on overcoming the negative obsticles of our own minds.I give it only 4 stars because although it's intended to be a high level approach, at times it can be a bit too abstract. I wish Marc would have given further details about how he started his company, along with more concrete examples of how his techniques helped him achieve financial success. Convincing yourself that you can fly is fine, but ultimately the dirt is in the details."
3,not as entertaining as most Hitchcock movies,It was OK. Jane Wyman of course was great. She is cute in this movie. Just recently discovered her as an actress before Falcon Crest. But this movie kinda dragged. And the ending was kinda . . . lame . . . . Anyway I made it through and so can you if you are interested. It is bascially about a girl who likes a guy who likes another woman. Then a murder happens and the guy becomes estranged from the girl he likes and the girl who likes him gets the opportunity to prove she likes him . . . in the time it takes to help him out.
3,stage fright - enhanced,"just got this dvd nothing enhanced about this movie just a standard quality picture doesn't even say enhanced anywhere on dvd cover so where did the sellar come up with this copy - enhanced - has the same look as a regular dvd with some lines,specks someone must have just made this up as this dvd is an enhanced copywhat some sellars with do just to make a sell .... just get the standard copy maybe it migh even be better?"
4,Good movie....BUT,Stage Fright is a good movie BUT be careful -- not all of the DVD's have the making-of documentary that one review talked about -- I was disappointed when my DVD arrived -- still this is a fun mystery to watch so I gave this Stage Fright DVD four stars.
5,Death disguised as love,"Looks like ""The laziest gal in town""; Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich) may be framing the high-strung Jonathan Cooper (Richard Todd). A drama student used her skills to try to prove this to the authorities. In the process, she may have found her true love Ordinary Smith (Michael Wilding)The film is classic Hitchcock. See if you can spot his signature cameo appearance.Alistair Sim and Sybil Thorndike give the film a Powell and Pressburger feel.This black and white standard DVD has some good extras including. A 2004 ""Hitchcock and Stage Fright""See Joyce Grenfell, the Duck lady aging in ""the Americanization of Emily"" (1964)The Americanization of EmilyThe Blue Angel (Enhanced) 1930"
4,....Poor Jane..!..4 stars..!,"...Jane tells a production story about how Marlene ""mothered"" over her during the making of this film..Jane did'nt know Marlene was a notorious bi-sexual, and was hitting on her..!..Jane is one of two stars buried in nuns habits..The other being phony Loretta Young who had Clark Gable's baby in 1935..Ah, Hollywood"
2,Don't buy this version.,"This is a wonderful Hitchcock movie, one of my favorites; but this is a bad transfer with strangely jerky motion. Get the other edition (Warner)."
3,Deservedly Mixed Reviews,"This pretty thin thriller has some nice touches, but deserves its tepid reputation in the Hitchcock canon. Critics malign the flashback that opens the picture as a giant cheat. But I think if the Richard Todd role were played better, that may have been overlooked. As it is, he's too creepy throughout, though marvelous at the hardly surprising climax. The other principals in the picture don't much register - except for Michael Wilding's eerie resemblance to Alan Cumming. There are two great screen personalities here - Alastair Sim and Dietrich, but Hitchcock seems uninterested in using them to full effect. (Though he tease us with Marlene in her final scene.) Not bad, but not some lost classic. It's certainly one of the least enjoyable Hitchcock pictures. Definitely feels longer than it's 110 minute running time."
1,Don't Bother,"The word ""Remastered"" in reference to this title mustmean ""really poorly digitally transferred."" It's a terriblecopy of a very good Hitchcock work. Save your money. Wait tillthe American Film Institute or some other worthy companyreleases it."
2,Cold,"I guess I'll be the only one here with a bad review of this Hitchcock movie.Though we have a very original story here, I was amazed at feeling that the actors were saying their lines at the camera, not at the opposite actor. And flatly at that! Never have I seen it show as much (and I have seen a lot of movies!!!). Nobody seemed convinced of what they were doing. We all know that Dietrich is not the best actress in the world(more an extraordinary personality)but here, she is cold as ever. Wyman is better... and Sims is the treasure of the lot, with much life to his character.However, at the risk of looking a bit out of order , I still encourage you to see it. I am not a Hitchcock fan, but I believe we learn to appreciate by viewing many different movies..."
1,Stage Fright,"I had to take this DVD to my local video store to buff out the scratches but the video still did not play right so, I cleaned my player for the second time the movie still did not play correctly. I will take it back to the store for a second mechanical buffing. This is very unusual for products from Amazon."
5,One of my favourite Hitchcock's,"Personally, I've always been more of a fan of Hitchcock's English work because it combines his trademark suspense with plenty of humour. Stage Fright follows this trend, like The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes, and it is a great little movie. I saw it years ago and I cannot remember much about the plot, but I was definately frozen to the screen in delight. I remember the inimitable Marlene Dietrich launching into many ridiculous but entertaining songs. I remember another priceless performance from Alistair Sim. I remember a great romantic scene between Jane Wyman and Michael Wilding in a cab. I remember most of all the climactic scene, where Jane Wyman talks to her fiancee, with enormous brown eyes (notwithstanding the film's being shot in black and white) while shadows stripe accross her face. I remember loving it."
5,exellent Hitchcock movie,"Jane Wyman and Marlene Dietrich star in the suspense-laden thriller STAGE FRIGHT, centering around the London theatre district and a murder involving a famous stage star.Eve Gill (Jane Wyman) seizes the acting oppertunity of a lifetime when her boyfriend Jonathan (Richard Todd) is framed for murder. She poses as the maid and goes to work for her boyfriend's accuser, stage great Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich). In her attempts to prove Jonathan's innocence, Eve has to question wether it is true......Featuring Michael Wilding, Kay Walsh, Alistair Sim and Dame Sybil Thorndike, STAGE FRIGHT is a rollicking adventure from beginning to end."
1,"Great Movie, Bad Transfer","This is a great Hitchcock movie, but don't be misled by ""Remastered"" on the cover of the [...] DVD. As one reviewer already noted, the image has a jerky quality that is very distracting and unwatchable. Buy another version."
4,Clever...perhaps a little too clever!,"To begin, let me say that I agree with other film buffs, thatAlfred Hitchcock's Stage Fright is the most underrated of his50's films. I think the reason for it being so, is that it's a little to artful and clever for its own good.This is due to its use of a flashback in which a lie is told!We can't see where the lie comes into place until the last sceneof the film. Clever...yes. Irritating...very!But still this is a film worth seeing because of two reasons.One, it is the first film in what I consider to be Hitchcock'sGolden decade(1950-60)of film making.Secondly, It is the only movie he made with the legendaryMarlene Dietrich. Which makes it a definite keeper!Add to that Richard Todd, a very young and very talented Jane Wyman.The great charicter actor Alastair Sim, Dame Sybel Thronedykeand Micheal Redgrave.Watching this film is a nice way to spend a weekend evening."
3,Murder cover up with a twist,"Stage Fright did not represent one of Hitchcocks's better efforts in comparison to his awesome body of work.The marginally talented Marlene Dietrich, plays a loose moraled, husky voiced actress/playgirl (quite a stretch for her!) who has apparently killed her husband. She implores her enamored lover, Richard Todd to cover up the crime, appearing at his flat in a blood soaked dress. She's attempting to dupe him into taking the fall for the crime.Aspiring actress, Jane Wyman, who is in love with Todd tries to protect him from the authorities. With aid from her flaky, accordion playing father, the accomplished Alistair Sim, she shields him from the police led by detective Michael Wilding. She eventually forsakes Todd and falls in love with Wilding resulting in an unpredictable ending."
3,Improvement to the audio medium for Star Trek,"I was hoping for a bit more with this story as it had 5 actors instead of three like its predecessor, ""Transformations"". Like ""Transformations"" it suffered because again it is set up as a series of log entries and personal memories, so again there is no interaction between the actors. Regardless, the story was intriguing and the use of sound as a plot device was clever for the audio meduim. The 3-D sound again was good and the use of headphones is recommended. There are some good elements of humor and drama in this but little character development or any sort of interpersonal relationships developed. My suggestion is that future audio adventures (and I hope there will be more) attempt to be more like plays than books read in the first person, much like the radio shows of old. The Star Trek series has great potential here that could be exploited. Despite it faults it is a worthwhile listen, and I look forward to the next one, ""Envoy""."
2,Too advanced for 3rd Graders,"My son's 3rd grade class read this book and was tested on it. I read the book and was surprised that they were reading it. It had a bunch of sarcasm that I thought would be over their heads, plus it used some behavior that I thought was inapproprite like calling someone stupid or telling someone to shut up. I think this book, which was a cute read, should have been for kids in the 4th grade or above."
1,"A ""who cares"" mentality",The photo on the cover is from an entirely different show. It is from Space Patrol. This shows you the poor quality control in place when producing this dvd. Avoid at all costs.
1,Boring!,I do not like star trek next generation. I think the should bring back captain Kirk. Then maybe you'd have a good book.
4,A pretty good version of the show,I felt that it was a very good and interesting Star Trek novel. the story line was very close to the T.V. show Episode. I really enjoyed the plotline and seeing the tng cast in the future. I think you would enjoy it.
1,So much money for a low quality product,"I was really disappointed with this product. It doesn't work very well,and it takes a long time to clean the pad.With further experimentation we discovered that if you throw the dirty pads in a washing machine and then in the dryer you achieve the same goal with way less hassle.Final Analysis: Skip this product and use the washing machine."
5,love it,"I purchased two of these because I got one for myself and sister, my sister and law saw it and I got it for her for Christmas! The second one I will give to my best friend because we always take are rings off when we cook or wash the dishes. This is the best way to put away rings and you know they are safe and won't go down the drain!"
2,Didn't last,"I owned a pair of these, liked them lots, but they literally fell apart in 2 days when 3 months old.I need them most days knocking around in the yard, etc. I rinsed them after each use if soiled & dried them in a laundry sink vertically, thinking they'd be OK as other brands before were treated the same... but the bottoms fell off at the same time one of the straps came unglued, on both feet the same day...today.Oh well."
3,I DIDN'T LIKE THIS BOOK AS MUCH AS I LIKED ASHES OF EDEN.,"I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED THE GREAT ADVENTURES OF START TREK, SPECIALLY THE ORIGINAL SERIE. THAT IS WHY I DON'T LIKE SOME THINGS ON THE BOOK. THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP AND FRIENSHIP OF THE 3 MAIN CHARACTERS IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THEY HAVE; IN MY OPINION THIS BOOK COULD BE RICHER IN THIS POINT. I ALSO DON'T LIKE THE CHANGE IN KIRK'S CHARACTER, HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN ALL THE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS HE HAS ENCOUNTERED, BUT NOW HE HAS LOST THE SPECIAL WAY HE HANDLED THESE SITUATIONS TO BE ONLY IN LOVE FOR TEILANI; I'M NOT AGAINST HIS FALLING IN LOVE WITH HER,BUT I DON'T AGREE WITH THE WAY HE FOCUS EVERYTHING ONLY FOR BEING WITH HER. I FOUND THE STORY VERY INTERESTING AND IS GOOD TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE SAGA SPECIALLY WITH A REMARKABLE WELL CONTINUING STORY FOR THE MIRROR WORLD. I ONLY WISH HE COULD GET BACK ALL THE WONDERFULS THINGS THE ORIGINAL SERIE HAS."
4,Loved it!,"Faked me out on the ending. Good twist.I thought the Enterprize had been duplicated into the dark universe.Ready the battle of the millinia! Let's see Kirk weasle his way out of this.I still liked ""The Return"" Best. I still swell up with laughter when I think of Data's crying scene."
4,A vary good Book!,A book worthy of Star Trek! Could be better if Shatner read Dark Mirror(Star Trek).
5,Spectre is incredible!,"William Shatner did it again with his latest smash hit ""Spectre"". The story of Kirk's journey of self discovery along with the battle against the invading mirror universe dissidents is second only to his other best-seller, ""The Return"". From the beginning on Chal to the epic climax on the bridge of a mirror Starship Voyager, Kirk and Picard team once again to stop something that has already been started, a vicious plot to replace high ranking Starfleet personnel with their twins. Planned and orchestrated by none other than Kirk's twin, the evil emperor Tiberius, who now has control of the Enterprise-E. I can't wait for the conclusion to this five book saga, ""Dark Victory"", to be released!"
5,Star trek to the fullest it deserves 10 gold stars.,"It could only take a person like Bill Shatner to write such an amazing adventure from the startrek universe. It has everything, love, adventure, technology and three out of four of the startrek cast (although Ben Sisko does get mentioned)I could not put the book down, because I wanted to know what was going to happen next, a brilliant story with a sequel to come I hope. If in the future they make a film staring all of the four startrek seires then they should base it on this book. In a word FANTASTIC......"
4,Not a dull moment to be had.,"This book was great. Shatner et al pull so many little things from the other Star Trek books and movies that it make the story fulfilling.Only problem I didn't like was that there was no final ending. It is to be continued. I see many of these series doing this. This one was not too bad, because it did tell us the end of many things. Thumbs up and I can't wait for the next book by Shatner et al."
5,Excellent Book.,"This book is a follow-up to the mirror universe episodes. So, we should see change in the mirror universe in this book."
3,The Kirk Adventures,"Happily remarried to a hybrid woman, that is a mix of just about every ""major"" species in the Alpha and Beta Quadrants, Kirk will return to Earth and be kidnapped.. and the Enterprise-E comes across a ship that's returned after being missing for 5ish years, Voyager. But it isn't as it appears seeing as half of the crew is dead, which can mean only one thing the Mirror Universe.I wasn't overly thrilled with the book and all the events got a little shaky after that.. it was ok, but I thought it could have been better."
5,Great book Mr. Shatner. I couldn't put it down.,"This was an fasinating and well written Star Trek book. I love how the movies and shows and other books intertwine together.The only thing I didn't like was that when Kirk said he finaly found the meaning of life and it was ""to live"" and that to leave anything else for the philosophers. I think that is not true no matter what century and that the true meaning of life is to live a life that glorifies God and to tell others about Jesus. TO GO BOLDLY AND TELL OTHERS OF JESUS IN ALL THE WORLD. And Jesus is for everyone for it is for every one he gave his life and not just for philosophers.I am looking forward to DARK VICTORY. Mr. Shatner is a great writer and actor and director. Keep up the good work and keep the books coming.Live Long and Prosper. Jesus loves you."
4,A real page-turner!,"While I agree with some of the other comments, that some of the characters are under-developed, this book is still a fascinating read. As for Kirk's ego-trip (not Shatner's), it seems perfectly in keeping with his character as we know it. I can't wait to read the sequel!"
5,This book was great! I can't wait for the next one!,William Shatner does an excellent job of telling of the continuing missions of both his original crew as well as the Next Generation's. The story is very well done and really could be motion-picture quality! The cliff hanger ending has me itching for the sequel.
2,Another bone of contention for continuity fans.,"Did the editors happen to read ""Dark Mirror"" by Diane Duane before approving this book? ""Dark Mirror"" was much more consistent with the history and predictions concerning the alternate universe. This is another Shatner ego fest (does he really think real life women find him as irresistible as his fictional alter ego?)"
3,A bit of a letdown.,"If you've seen the last couple of years of DS9, a lot of this novel is going to feel really, really familiar. Not that I didn't like the basic premise of the mirror universe characters coming over to ours using their own version of Voyager. But, let's face it, DS9 has done the whole high-ranking officials have been replaced by imposters better. I never really bought into the basic premise of the novel and that fact that it all builds up to a massive cliffhanger to what will (hopefully) be the last of the series is also upsetting. After enjoying Ashes of Eden and the Return, I was expected more. But I wasn't rewarded."
5,Can't retire yet Capt. Kirk the universe need you!,"I've always enjoyed the Star Trek movies and the series but I didn't read the books until,""The Return"". I've also read,""Avenger"" and now,""Spectre"" and I've really enjoyed reading them. I like seeing Capt.Kirk back in action with his old friends and the TNG crew and the slick way the movies and old episodes are tied in to the books. I liked this book because of the old episode tie in where Capt. Kirk's good intentions didn't get good results and he has to see and deal with what has happened because of it. I look forward to the next book and hope Mr. Shatner keeps Capt. Kirk alive and in action for a long time."
5,Enough with the bad reviews...,"Really then, my friends.. This book was wonderous-- i read it in less than four days. That's quite a small time fer me, thankyou. I could barely stop from reaching for it at every turn. Now, i am rather disturbed at the negative reviews, constantly stating that there was not enough character development, etc etc. And the physics of it all. Well *really*... It is a 3 book series, in other words, its really a 900 or so page book, not just one. And as for physics... Come on, ST is very off base science in many cases. But does it matter? Hell no! This book was great, worth reading over and over. Later everyone... And by the way-- ignore my grammar and such-- i am talking in sim-speak. Ask a friend. <eg> ::waves::"
5,Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Shatner's Best Trek Novel!,"This is my absolute favorite in Shatner's Trek series. ""Spectre"" is the first book in what would become the ""Mirror Universe"" Trilogy. You see the return of Tiberius and Spock's mirror-self from the TOS episode ""Mirror, Mirror"".What makes this book so interesting is that you find out what has happened in the mirror universe after Kirk and his crew left. And let's just say that things have taken a turn for the worse. Tiberius has a partner, none other than Picard's mirror self. Kirk discovers again that his worst enemy is in fact himself. A great read indeed!"
5,The Begining of it all,"This is book one of the Mirror Universe saga. James Kirk is ready to settle down and live out the rest of his soon to be bride, but that doesn't even get a chance. The book is a great opener for the trilogy. Kirk is forced to rely on people from the corrupt mirror universe who think he is the evil former Emperor Tiberius. With Kirk facing so many obsticles, this is a quick read and will keep you going for hours on end. The ending of this Book is unthinkable and leads directly into book two, DARK VICTORY."
5,Great Sink,"Ordered In White, very heavy over 100 lbs , includes cutout template, make sure you cut a radius corner , not much of a flange, required extra beefing up to support the weight for sure , very nice finish , get the Kohler sink strainer and p trap for a good install , cast iron sink has short stub legs for sitting like a bathtub if needed"
5,"Heart-swelling, spirit-lifting. great stuff","A joyful noise in the grandest manner. Bigger-than-life music written for the biggest occasions, gorgeously played. Even the young teen brass-player it was bought to ""instruct"" loved it, right off, without the sign of an argument. A fine, rare success."
3,John Owen Volume 3 kindle version,"Although the Kindle version is VERY ROUGH, I believe that it is worth the money (come on, it is only 99 cents!). One does have to do some serious work in gleaning; but, treasures abound. I wish that the version could have been perfect in presentation -- and, I tend to be a perfectionist -- but, the jewels within far outweigh the difficulty in discovering them! I would get this book again -- knowing what I know -- simply because I love John Owen and this is a phenomenal work. His words and concepts are priceless. But, if you are a very fastidious person more concerned with appearance and ease, then perhaps it would be best to hold off for another improved version at a later date."
1,"There are hundreds of novels with this title, Why did I end up with this one?",Well it was deleted from my library's collection. Good decision. Buying it for a buck was my bad decision Absolutely Awful.
1,Un-readable,"Hated the protaganist, the plot, the cardboard characters, the droning on and on about being found out and his annoyingly cloying wife, Tina, and cutesy, stupid son, Ben. Ben Chambers ultimately was annoying as well. And to what resolution. He gets away with everything? How convenient that the bodybuilder girls die. Just like real life. This was junk. Not even a decent short story."
3,"DONE BEFORE, BUT STILL A GOOD READ","The plotline of this engaging, if somewhat implausible novel, has been done many times before. John Farris covered this territory in a short story in SCARE TACTICS; of course Stephen (with a ph) King did it somewhat in SECRET WINDOW. The ""hero"" in this tale is Steven King, so that's an interesting and original concept, but much of the book employs the plot devices in the aforementioned books. The characters of Vera and June, the weightlifting sisters, are two of the most evil characters I've visited for a while. My problem is that since you know what's going to happen, I found myself wanting Reid to hurry the plot along. Reid has a keen knowledge and insight into the publishing industry, and that makes for engaging reading. However, I found the ""twist"" at the end a little hard to swallow. I'm sure the readers who loved this book have every right to do so, but to me, it was just a rehashed version of other author's works."
3,"not a biography, rather a bit of a loving massage","a pleasant read, but the author gives the impression that the burp mr. rechy let loose back in 1983 carries massive cultural significance."
4,An Informative and Fascinating Read,"I read this book while traveling on a long flight, and I had a hard time putting it down. I was aware of John Rechy, as an author, but this book allows us a view into Rechy the man, with his inner turmoil and obsessions. While it is true Rechy's books were autobiographical in nature, Charles Casillo provides insight from obviously many sessions with Rechy, as well as his peers and friends, that motivates the reader to want to read more of Rechy's works. The biography is well written and documented, and even began to challenge some of my own inner development and feelings. I found this a very fascinating and good read!"
2,Sorry - no good,This doesn't do much more than what AdAware or SpyBot can do for your registry. Sorry - didn't find it of any value.
5,Super delicious,"I have no idea how they get the macadamia nut flavor or the coconut flavor, but they do a great job of it. It doesn't seem like they can use tiny pieces of macadamia nut or coconut in an herbal tea, and I can't imagine that the coconut husk or parts of the macadamia nut plant (? I'm obviously not a botanist) would taste like coconuts and macadamia nuts, respectively. But whatever they're doing here, they're doing it right."
2,Flavorless,I was looking for really good flavor.I could not even taste the coconut.For me this is another tea to add with the others I don't use.
3,Daily Life in the Middle Ages,"This book has a lot of information which was interesting. However, most of the info was about the later Middle Ages, not the early years which I was interested in. Also, it dwelt on the upper classes while I wanted info on the lower and middle classes."
4,A much more comprehensive view than commonly defined--,"This describes Anglo-Saxon daily life in the Middle Ages (roughly 900 - 1200 C.E. I minored in history, with a special enjoyment of the Middle Ages - however I graduated in 1961. The History in most State universities was more of pointing out significant historical persons, significant battles fought, bickering over who really was heir to such and such a kingdom, and did not have the accompanying anthropology and archaeology that today's historical studies embraces.It managed to fill-in some rather gaping holes in my knowledge in an easy to read format. I enjoyed it."
5,Daily Life in the Middle Ages,"Daily Life in the Middle Ages was much more rich and colorful than I would have imagined. Paul Newman has answered a lot of the questions I would not have thought to ask about, and given me a new appreciation for that chunk of history."
4,Great book,This book is set out in a way that makes it incredibly easy to find the information you need. The author gives informative information about each of the topics without being boring or mundane. It has greatly assisted my research of the era and I highly recommend it.
3,Kind of dull,"I ordinarily love books about this timespan, but I have to agree with some other reviewers, this writer made me crazy trying to convince me the Middle Ages were not bad at all. I don't see the point. He wasn't there, so how does he know anyway? Beyond that aggravation, the chapter headings sounded fascinating, but with this writer's treatment they ended up seeming dull and uninspired. Not awful, just not fun."
2,Too much about nothing,"The reason that I bought the book is that one can only assume that life in the Middle Ages had to be a richer and diverse life than what is most often depicted in movies and stories, however, the author goes into details about the mundane only to share very little that is unique and startling. I have not read the entire book yet but I will because at some point I am sure that I will learn something that I didn't know, but would like to."
2,Bad writing of Interesting Material,author repeats ad nauseaum pet theory that Dark Age were not so dark...duh...making the reader fish through turgid prose for the admitedly tasty morsels of info. Not worth premium Kindle price. None in publisher stable so far worth the arrogant pricetag.
2,Not really - facts but no feeling,A great disappointment. An extensive assembly of data but with no real attempt to put those data into a context. I really looked forward to reading this book but was left with a meatless beefburger. And as for DAILY Life ... I think not; unless all the commoners were gentry that is.Broker
5,Wonderful Book,This is a must read for any student or teacher of the Alexander Technique. Simple and direct writing. Walter was a very kind gentleman and this comes through in all of his lectures on the Alexander Technique.
3,"Tough read, but worth it for the open-minded","If you can go in to it with an open mind, this book can be a wonderful read. It is a book which requires a thick skin at points, and definitely a willingness to listen (if not accept) some decidedly nonorthodox views on history, religion, sex, and other ideas. The reader who can go in to it with the right state of mind, though, could learn some interesting things. That said, in places the text is difficult. There is a lot of repetition and it isn't always easy to follow the author's thread, especially with the numerous names and linkages between them. This is a book which requires patience."
2,Elitist and doctrinal,"This book is so full of predjudice and preconceived ideas presented as supposed fact, it's amazing. Some small passages with interesting ideas and concepts. But all in all a book that contributes to perpetuate injustice and intolerance."
2,Crapola,"DisappointingThe guy is living in a fantasy land - he is about as 'evolved' as a dry fartInaccurate and written for shock value. It is not that what he writes is that far out, it's just that he has no idea about the House del Aqus and the Dragon Queens"
5,Great,I bought these as a replacement for my old Homer slippers. These are great. They're comfortable and hold up very well.
5,Best slippers ever,"These slippers could not be better!! Soft and warm, bigger than I thought they would be which is great and look exactly what they look like in the picture. I promise you that you will not be disappointed when you get these!!! They even got here extremely fast. I could not be happier."
1,"Same Product - Multiple Names , different Prices","This product is available with another name too i.e. ""Chemistry: Elements, Compounds and Mixtures "" - Search and compare the prices before you choose one"
3,Running through the rain with an umbrella of fire.,"Obviously not up to the standard Gaiman started out with in the Books of Magic mini-series, but then again it was not expected to be. Only Gaiman can write like Gaiman. The plot is a little hap-hazard and it has a few confusing moments. The significance of Tim's dueling tatoos, what exactly happened to Cupid, what happened to that director guy... there are a lot of plot threads that are totally abandoned or unexplained. But the magic of the story is still in there somewhere. It may not be seen in the monsters and mermaids and fairys. The magic in the book is the beautiful way Tim and Leah and Molly's goofy adolescence is perfectly portrayed (even if Leah is several thousand years old). Good. Not Gaiman good. But good."
3,Most inconsistent book in an inconsistent series.,"John Ney Rieber, The Books of Magic: Girl in a Box (DC Comics, 1999)The Books of Magic has been an inconsistent series, and Girl in a Box, the fifth book in the series, typifies that perhaps better than any other single entry. Tim and Molly, separated in the last book, are still separated; Molly is off in Faerie, while Tim is facing down the demons tattooed onto his skin. The main story arc here is quite a good one; Tim and his old friend/nemesis Leah meet in San Francisco, then head off to the desert to find a place of magical power; the interaction between the two is very nicely done, and the plotline is interesting and well-written. All of the tertiary stuff in the book, though, could well have been done without.If you've already gotten this far in the series, of course you're going to read this one; there's enough here for you to sink your teeth into. Others, start at the beginning and see if you get this far. ***"
4,Ok Collection,"This was bought as a nostalgia type gift. It is a mix of cartoons, but overall it is a neat little collection of Nick Toons. 7 episodes: The Finster Who Stole Christmas (All Grown Up); Christmas Who? (SpongeBob SquarePants); Christmas Every Day! (The Fairly OddParents); The Santa Experience (Rugrats); The Fright Before Christmas! (Danny Phantom); A Robot for All Seasons (My Life as a Teenage Robot); When Santas Collide (ChalkZone). Just under 3 hours long will keep kids busy watching the stuff you grew up on."
5,Good collection,"I bought it for 3 episodes: Christmas Who? (SpongeBob SquarePants), Christmas Every Day! (The Fairly OddParents), and The Santa Experience (Rugrats). The quality is good and the price was great. (I only wish it included the Christmas episodes of Rocko's Modern Life, Doug, and Hey Arnold!) But for the price, even if you only like a couple of these cartoons, it is well worth the price."
2,"Very, Very, VERY Beginner -","I am not an active person at all (although I did do yoga many years ago), and I thought this beginners set would be a good place to re-start a movement practice. WAY too beginner! One DVD is nothing but EYE movements, the other two use a chair for most, if not all of the 'exercises' (I use that term loosely). If you are very elderly or have severe health and/or mobility issues, then this set will be perfect for your needs. If you can walk and bend without assistance, this will not benefit you at all (unless maybe you want to meditate). The set itself is not 'bad', just be aware that it is not meant for anyone that has even reasonable health and body motion ability."
3,It is very outdated but some of it is ok made in 80s and early 90s,I was gonna return this because it is pretty outdated. Seems to be made in the 80s to early 90s. The front cover is pretty misleading. I did like the gentle dvd and I use some of the essentials one. It is slow paced. It would be great for people who are very new and need every step easy to understand or someone with injuries or an older person. I decided just to keep it and not go through the hassel and just use it for some night time exercise. So anyone under the age of 25 or even 30 may find the outdatedness really annoying. But again it is good for those who need to learn the absolute basics more slowly.
3,Not for the back injured.,"Found the inflexible easiest tape informative, but way too far out for me physically...just not the pretzel type. Have a bad back maybe will try when back gets better."
5,Very Very Good,"This set of videos is a perfect selection if you are inflexible or very new to yoga like I am.It is designed to really help you out between the 3 choices, Yoga For Inflexible, Essential Yoga For Inflexible and Gentle Yoga. The first one guides you through modified moves to make things real easy and allows you target areas, the second is a more general version with a couple of sections that are more modified then some less modified things and the last has three sections of various levels.I have found things that I can do on each one and am rotating them every day."
4,Good intro to yoga.,"The first CD is pretty much for people with injuries or elderly people. The positions were a little too easy because the instructor uses a chair prop the whole time.The second two CD's are good for inflexible people or people new to yoga because they say when to breath so you can time it right and they tell you exactly where each part of your body should be. They also hold the poses for a long time so you build flexibility, balance, and stamina.If you want more of an aerobic workout from your yoga, this is not the disc set for you."
4,If you're really THAT inflexible.....,"Nice set. But if you can bend over to pick up something off the floor, it may not be challenging enough to notice improvement. I did, however, learn some new poses and it's certainly a good buy."
2,Seriously?,"Popped the first disc into the player, chose the first option, and was very surprised to see the woman doing things only a double-jointed person could do. My impression was this product is intended for inflexible people. However, it requires a great deal of flexibility to perform the tasks. On top of this, the actions are very fast-paced, which led me to feel as if an injury was inevitable. Proper stretching doesn't occur in the blink of an eye. Next..."
3,Not that great,I have never done yoga before this DVD and it didn't go very slow. I guess I was just expecting more from this. In the picture It shows the 3 dvds and I watched the one with the lady(hair in pony tail)and the ocean background. It is alright. I was expecting more. It's not a bad DVD set and it's not a good one. Its ok. I still have to watch the other 2 DVDs. If they prove to be good I'll make sure to write about them.
2,Not my favorite home Yoga DVD,"These DVDs are definitely for beginning yoga students, which is fine. However, the sets and voice overs are really unappealing, regardless of your yoga level. For example, one of the DVDs looks as though it was set in an Olan Mills studio from the 1980's. I prefer the Element Yoga DVDs - the setting is serene and becomes a part of the home yoga/DVD experience. This 3 DVD-set is headed for Goodwill."
5,Perfect for Me,"This collection of DVDs is just right for my beginner's status, as well as my ""shyness"" when it comes to the gym. Love the selection of routines as well."
5,Inflexible No More,"I still have a way to go, but am making alot of improvement over the last 6 months or so with these videos. There are some nice and easy things to do, even just sitting on a chair with some basic movements or using a chair for some support, and I highly recommend starting with those.They helped me loosen up a bit and learn the movements before moving onto learning other things on the videos where you stand and do more movements."
5,Good issue,"I know others have griped about Playboy putting Carol Alt in the issue. ""She's old"" so what? The lady is still beautiful. I enjoyed her pictorial. Thumbs up to Playboy for getting her in the issue."
5,The bold and the Q,"Lwaxana in LovePeter David has a variation of the wedding aboard the Enterprise theme. This was done in the first season with Troi and the beginning of the second season with the Okona character helping Picard with the two warring families. In this one Troi's Mom, Lwaxana falls for Q! She even acquires powers of our favorite from the Q continuum. She does not fear his ability to wipe out anyone in an instant. Of all of the novels this is one that should have been produced as an episode. The dialogue rings true to all the characters.In this one we even get a surprise visit from Q two. Portrayed by Corben Bernsen from LA Law. The surprise in this novel is that no one acts contrary to the way we see them on TV. In too many of the novels the dialogue doesn't cut it. This reads like an episode from beginning to end."
3,Disappointing.,"I've always been fond of Peter David's work; what enthralls me is the fact that he's one of the few writers of Star Trek books who can capture the feel of some of the original series episodes, like ""Trouble With Tribbles"", ""A Piece of the Action"", and ""Shore Leave"", which manage a tongue-in-cheek humor without sacrificing the drama of an actual plot. This book didn't seem to me to find that balance as well as others of his that I've read; the humor seemed more heavy-handed, the plot sillier and less worthwhile. It finished better than it started, but on balance I didn't feel like I was reading a real Star Trek story with a bit of humor to it; I felt as though I was reading a comedy with the gloss of a Star Trek story superimposed on it.Still not a bad book; just not nearly as good as I expect from Peter David."
3,"Combine Q and Luxana Troi, watch out!","The Q storyline in TNG has its many highs and lows. I'm afraid this story is toward the low end.Although classic David in its humor and premise, Q in Law seems to lack some of the overall genuiness that other David novels have exhibited.Worth buying by Q fans."
4,Fun again,"I've allways enjoyed Peter David's work, and he did it again. Good naration and a fun plot as well."
3,"David's writing holds, but plot is seen nowhere...","First of all, I enjoyed this book very much.It was fun, entertaining and I recomend it. But if you look at it analytically, problems arise.The main weakness is the lack of decent storytelling and plot. It's a comical science fiction drama written like a situation comedy. Situations follow each other without any logical reason and this makes the storytelling erratic.Peter David's writing is exellent again, but the story simply doesn't hold well enough. I recommend it, but it's not as good as some other novels by peter David."
5,"The best Peter David has written, better than New Frontier","This is THE book for all David fans, the comedy is top notch. This is the fastest book I have ever read unable to put it down for the briefest of moments. If you have ever wanted Q to be caught in a cat and mouse situation, place this in your cart right now, there will be no disapointment for any Star Trek fan."
4,A Nice Read For Valentine's Day,"The entire time, this story felt like something I should have been reading on Valentine's Day. The whole book is about love and Q's ""romance"" with Deanna's mother. Overall, it is a good story but it gets silly when Lwaxana Troi takes revenge on Q for breaking her heart. I could picture it all in my head and it was pretty laughable more than threatening to read her beating Q up with Q powers of her own. A lot of the characters from TNG are missing or with little mention. I was surprised how the only cast members really in the story are Picard, Deanna and Lwaxana."
2,"Light on instruction, big on ego","Barely a chapter in I determined that this book was not for me. Looking for instruction I was dissappointed to say the least when I found that this book was more informative of the photographer's talent with gadgets which we are to assume are needed based on what he writes. The photos are fantastic but if you are a digital photographer looking for instruction and not another book about how great the photographer is or about how some gadget is going to help you become a great photograper also, then pass on this book."
1,Lacking Instruction,"As a new photographer, I did not find this book very helpful in giving an in-depth explanation of creating correct exposure. The book had a brief summarization of each topic (ex. shooting in snow) at the beginning of each chapter, and then was followed by his photographs to assumingly show examples of the topic. It seemed more like a collection of his photographs than anything for me. I didn't find that there was enough information in the book for helping to correct exposure issues. The photos were great, just really lacked instruction. I ordered several books of this type at one time, and highly recommend The Better Photo Guide to Digital Photography by Jim Miotke-loaded with helpful instruction and tips, including lessons. Also Bryan Peterson's Understanding Exposure. These two have helped tremendously vs.Perfect Exposure by Zuckerman."
3,Learn by example - if you can...,Not as technical as I expected. Just a collection of examples. In the end you will learn with your practice.
4,photographic help,A book to refer to again and again as you mature in your photographic experience.Beautiful photographs throughout with excellent examples of difficult exposure problems and the solutions for them.
4,Good Book,"Good book, easy to read, with a lot of suggestions about where read the exposure. Also if the book is more than 150 pages, there are a lot of big photos, everyone with a comment; instead of this I would have prefereed more photos with comment also if they would have been smaller. So, I read this book in too little time. My rate for this book is 3.5."
3,The Problem With Buying Socks Online,"When will sock merchants online provide accurate color descriptions? The photos really aren't that helpful. The description of these socks say ""Brown"". Silly me, I assume ""Brown"" means Medium Brown. Makes sense, right? No, they are Dark Brown. So very Dark Brown that it's hard to distinguish them from Black. Sometimes it's useful and makes a difference in making a decision for an online purchase. Gold Toe is a great brand otherwise."
4,Gold Toe Fluffies,The socks are not what I thought I was ordering but they're fine.Apparently you no longer make the type my husband likes.
2,Gold Toe Cotton Fluffies not fluffy!,"I should have heeded the other reviews of this product. These socks are not the classic Gold Toe ""Fluffies"" that have been so hard to find in department stores these days. I have about 6 old pairs of them and they are practically threadbare. I have been needing to replace them, but cannot find ""Fluffies"" in white, and THESE ARE NOT THE SAME!!! Very disappointed, and I don't understand why Gold Toe does not make the Fluffies in white anymore. I have only seen them in tan in JC Penney, but that would not look right with sneakers. I guess my search must go on."
1,Not the Gold Toe socks they used to be,"What happened to Gold Toe socks I used to wear exclusively? Yes, these feel soft at first touch. Fluffy? Absolutely not. The sole is so thin and rough, you can feel the weave rubbing against the bottom of your foot. I need to find a new brand.Update: Now, after 2-3 wearings, one sock split at the heel while I was putting it on. What junk! Changing my rating from 2 stars to 1."
2,Dissappointed,"The White Goldtoe Fluffies for Men were not what I expected. I had purchased the same goldtoe fluffie sox in other colors, i.e. black, brown, blue, etc. and was very satisfied. The white fluffies were NOT fluffy. They were like any other athletic white sox on the market. I won't go to the expense of buying them again. There are too many like them out there that are less expensive and of the same caliber. The other colors are fine, fluffy and comfortable as advertised, but not the white."
2,Fluffies don't hold up,"Based on the prior reviews, I fully expected to like these. Unfortunately, I don't, and won't buy more. They don't stay up. I don't have particularly large or small calves, and don't have that issue with my other athletic socks. Oh, well, buy and learn.I bought both white and black and they are equally disappointing."
1,bad socks,"Far too much elasticity, which gets MORE and MORE restrictive over time. The old GT plain white cotton socks were my atandby. I don't want a white athletic sock, I want a white everyday sock. Gold Toe has stopped making 'em. Well, good-bye Gold Toe."
5,"The best ""white cotton casual sock"" you can buy","These are NOT the ""Cheap-O"" white socks. They are the Gold Toe White Fluffies we all look for ! Extra heavy cotton weight to absorb sweat and provide that soft cushion feeling for your feet. The elastic bind holds the socks up just fine without the top coming undone after many washes. I wear white socks everyday and buy 2-dozen at a time. These socks will last me 5-years ! Remember ..wash them with cold water and tumble dry on ""low heat"" to make the cotton fabric last a long time."
2,Fluffies?,"These socks are not the same cotton fluffies I have been buying for years, they are much thinner.I am very dissapointed that Gold Toe have lowered their quality yet still charge a premium price. Time to switch brands."
2,Not like they use to be.,I agree with the comments of those people who were disappointed with the thickness of the new version of the socks. They did not resemble the good ole Gold tones. It is like buying a pair of socks from Walmart.
1,Horrible Quality and Comfort,"These socks are extremely uncomfortable. They're not at all soft. Furthermore, they began falling apart after the first wash. The Docker's socks I ordered (Dockers Men's 3-Pack Sport Crew Socks, on the other hand, are extremely comfortable and seem very durable. Do not buy these socks."
4,A rather slight but charming fairy tale,"Windleaf is a pleasant enough fairy tale. Its plot strongly resembles Lord Dunsany's The King of Elfland's Daughter, but the writing is much more accessible for younger fantasy readers. Although the writing seems occasionally a little contrived and the whole novel is not very thought-provoking, it does have likable characters, a quickly moving plot and plenty of magic. It is a bit on the generic and shallow side, though, and older readers might just as well pass over this one for Neil Gaiman's much more inventive Stardust or Dunsany's beautiful The King of Elfland's Daughter. Another good bet is Elizabeth Marie Pope's The Perilous Gard, which is set in 16th century England and deals with fairies; it's quite a bit deeper than Windleaf and feels much more realistic.Ailanna"
4,Another book from the Realms of Faerie!,"This was an interesting book, and I really enjoyed reading it. However, I think it was a bit weaker in plot and character development when compared to Child of Faerie, Child of Earth the first book to enter the Realms of Faerie. Still, Windleaf is a great read, and I recommend it."
2,It ain't the Jimmy we know and Love...,"I'll keep it straight and to the point. If you want to try a Jimmy Giuffre record, this isn't the one to start with. Although he still sounds great, the cheezy synth sounds just don't cut it. Try anything from his late 50's - early 60's era, for example, 'Western Suite', 'Free Fall', 'The Jimmy Giuffre 3'..."
2,not even close to what was expected,I'm sorry but this cd is not very good at all. Maybe he didn't try hard enough.
5,Lacy and Misha rock!,This group is a unique combination of talents .Excellant arrangements and a tight blend of horns make this one of lacys finest recordings
4,Why Winners Win,"Great little book with powerful stuff. I used it innumerable times as reference for my college project papers. Sometimes, just a line or two will spark a connection or idea that allows me to come up with the answer. Great!"
5,"""Tally-Ho!!!""","General Trelane (retired) returns in this book. The former Squire of Gothos is a Q, as it turns out. And Guess who is Trelane's mentor? That's right, that lovable imp known as Q. This is a blending of The Orginal Series and of The Next Generation, as it has James Kirk in it, albeit briefly.A must for any Star Trek fan."
4,Pretty much strictly for Trek nerds,"But you knew that already, right? It follows three different alternative timelines. One is the ""normal"" one, one is an alternative where Jack Crusher is alive, and Picard is his first officer on the Enterprise, and one is the alternate from ""Yesterday's Enterprise,"" in a losing war with the Klingon Empire. Along comes Trelane, of an original-series episode, to mess things up. Turns out that Trelane is a young Q, and Q himself is his guardian, trying (with very limited success) to guide Trelane to adult Q-hood. Trelane becomes petulant (as he was with Kirk), and all hell breaks loose as he crashes the timelines together and sends Q into near-oblivion. Sorting it all out is a fun ride, but this is definitely a book I feel no need to keep after reading it."
2,"Another ""omigod-it's-the-end-of-the-universe"" story","If you're one of those Trekkies who is turned on by stories of characters having sex with each other, then this is the one for you.If you prefer stories in which the Star Trek characters behave somewhat believably, then you might want to look elsewhere.An interesting premise, that Trelane from the original series is actually a member of the Q Continuum. But the story gets way out of hand as the plot skips across several alternate universes, leading to a completely overblown finale. A lowpoint is a particularly nasty, and more than a little misogynist, story about an alternate Beverly Crusher.It's also a bit long at over four hundred pages."
4,Great (as usual),"Loved the book --- as usual, since Peter David is easily the best of the Next Generation novel writers. I only have one complaint (excuse me while I mount this soapbox)...How come every unusual event in the galaxy gets attributed to Q? There's a dangerous tendency among shared-universe writers to try to make connections between different stories, and this is a prime example. The universe used to be full of exciting, interesting, unusual things... but not any more. It's all just Q playing tricks. Makes for a more boring universe, if you ask me.(Off my soapbox now.) In spite of what I just said, this is a great story definitely worth reading!"
4,Very good,"Being a fan of the infamous Q, I picked up this book because it was obvious from the title that he was involved. The time track thing was a little hard to follow-but I was able to sort it out after the second time through. It was quite entertaining and the ending shows a-gasp-human side to Q. I thoroughly enjoy Peter David's writing and eagerly await more."
3,Not Bad...,"I'm a huge fan of Star Trek, and I've read most of Peter David's work, including Q-In-Law which is very humorous and a delight to read. Its about Trelan, who is Q's godson. Trelan is one spoiled, rotten little thing, and that isn't good when he's both ominpotent and outta control! He decideses he wants to wreck the entire universe apart, which creates ultimate HAVOC! THe story line is way too complicated to type out, so yo ugotta read it! Q-Squared started out great, but in the end it is so twisted and confusing, with several pages of absolutely NOTHING, that it just wants you to put down the book with a fat head ache. If you are truly one Star Trek fan, plow your way through it, then pick up Q-In-Law for some ""lighter reading""."
1,Typical David: Trash,"Peter David is a master at making people love his books through extensive use of sex and soap opera gimmicks. He also screws up the characterizations of virtually all of the characters. If you're looking for good Sci-Fi, read Dune by Frank Herbert. If you're looking for good Trek, read Federation by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens."
5,Rabih Abou-Khalil continues to grow,"As a long-time fan of Rabih Abou-Khalil (I've got the whole series), I am very pleased to hear him continue to grow in new musical directions. His use of solo violin and cello on this album shows that he knows how to exploit the possibilities of these instruments within the kind of music he loves. I think it's a great improvment over his Arabian Waltz album, where the string quartet with tuba was pleasant enough, but to my ears his music is much more interesting with fewer players sharing a looser, more personal interaction."
5,Unsurpassed,"This is one of Rabih Abou-Khalil's most impressive achievements. The melodic lines are astonishingly long, varied and beautiful. Some of his loveliest -- and saddest -- tunes are here. The arrangements (with Dominique Pifarely on violin, Vincent Courtois on cello and Nabil Khaiat on drums) approach the perfection of a string quartet, every note crystalline, yet the music is accessible to all listeners. If you can get hold of a copy of Yara, I am sure you will treasure it."
5,CLASSIC,"Hall & Oates were and are the perfect sense of the 80's, and their music still having que perfect side of the clubholl of these age."
4,Anybody Got This? Is it Improved?,I saw this was just released today 'april 1st 2008' but I can't get any info on it. Is this the same as the previous U.S. release? I know many thought the Japanese disc was superior. How does this measure up?
3,Squeak boom pop,"The last of Hall & Oates' quartet of top-of-the-charts records sounds goofy, slick, and occasionally like there's some soul to it. ""Out of Touch"" is almost undeniable, though ""Method of Modern Love""--a sort-of-clever concept with a sort-of-brilliant execution--might be the highlight. Beyond that, there are no standouts; it all sort of blends together into a mildly-good surface of flat pop. Still, the production's pretty smooth, and the music is often catchy, even if there's little humanity in most of the songs. But it is pop, after all. Right? (See: ""Ooh Yeah!"".)"
4,I went back in time!,"Many years has past that I didn't buy any music. I was talking with a friend and we were talking about Hall & Oats and while I was talking with him I was surfing Amazon and find a great deal on this CD and I said 'what the heck!' and bought it. When receive it I download it into my iTunes library as soon as start playing took me back in time. When I was in the 7th grade to be precise. Each song has a story enclose within. Of course Out of Touch, I could even remember the video, he he he. Possession Obsession and Dance On Your Knees are great. The best deal it is that this CD is a remastered version, the sound is awesome, clean and clear. The bonus tracks are just mix of the most popular songs of the CD, but to be sincere, I love the originals they were just perfect the way they are. Great Hall & Oats CD for those who love their unique style."
3,"Nice packaging, bonus tracks, sub-par sound","i saw the remasters and was pleased to see the 12""'s included as my original copies are pretty worn. However, getting to what matters, the sound. I opened and saw Darcy Proper's credit to the remastering and thought ""oh no..."" As usual, quite heavy noise reduction was used, leaving the sound feeling like it's trying to burst through a wall. It just sounds very processed. My recommendation for cd is either the 1996 remaster or the import Japanese 24 bit, which is a little bright but very nice overall. As for the the 12"", i'm gonna splurge and get the Japanese 2-volume collection, which are 24 bit and reportedly sound very nice. Should have done that to start with! Oh well...."
1,Horrible transference from book to audiobook,"I bought this so that I could listen to the novel while driving in the car. I was horrified to find that I had paid almost ten dollars for only half a book! How could you leave out most of the novel? No wonder people find that the story is somehow ""incomplete"". It IS incomplete. You should not pass off a novel as the original book. It does injustice to the author and the reader.SHAME ON YOU!"
3,"Not a bad read, but a tad slow at the start...","McIntyre's Enterprise, The First Adventure, comes from the days of the larger Star Trek novels, the days when not as much was known from the various spin-off tv series and movies that followed the original series itself. As such, this novel is interesting, and certainly fills in some of the holes in the series to that time.I found the last third of the novel more action-packed and entertaining than the opening and middle chapters. Like some others here, I found the vaudeville background that the characters are set in to be somewhat tedious, and it took some perseverance on my part to get through that to finish the book. However, the ending is worth it, although one must wonder, given the serious scenario that is portrayed in the last third of the work, if the Enterprise crew wouldn't have been a tad bored with some of their later adventures in comparison to this first one..."
5,Great service!,"I was very pleased by the the quickness in which I recieved my book. Condition of the book was better than anticipated (""Good"" being a relative term). It was in excellant condition in my opinion.I would definately use this vendor again."
1,Enterprise the First Adventure,I've been a Star Trek fan for a long time and enjoy both the tv series and the books. This was the worst book I've read to date. It was clear the author does not understand the characters or the overall theme of Star Trek. Kirk is made out to be an uncertain teenager. A very disappointing effort for the supposed first adventure.
1,A flying horse?,"This book is well written in the sense that I know that if it was not...it would not get published....but...The whole vaudville circus thing really killed this book for me...I wanted to know about the crew and all I got was this rambling mess about flying horses and ditzy horse keepers. I just wish that this kind of thing was rare in Star Trek books...it seems that everytime a (hate to sound sexist) female writes a Star Trek novel, it gets lost in stupid fantasies with stupid and overblown alien creatures...When you write for Star Trek you have to understand that we as humans can relate to aliens that have a basic human shape or idea...no stupid raptor doctors or flying horses...it is like a bad TOS episode...just silly.don't read this book it is really not as good as the back of it makes it sound."
2,ok!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,On its first mission the Enterprise hosts a traveling circus and invertently runs into a bubble ship filled with fuzzy little aliens. And you expect me to believe this?
1,Boring and slick.,"I've been practicing yoga on and off for about 3 years, and I found this video to be not kid-oriented enough. The set is lush with sweeping curtains, tall windows and chandaliers, the instructor is dressed in a buxom-enhancing babe-like fashion. Her delivery is not fun but patronizing. I'm going to keep searching because my son who is 8 wants to do yoga but found this princess girlie-style video to be completely uninspiring."
1,misunderstanding,I didn't realize when I ordered that the tape was VHS until after I received it. If I had read clearly I would have not ordered it. Then it would of not been worth it to send it back when I received it.
3,"It's a Chilton manual so... well, you know what it's for.","If you can't afford the Mercury factory service manuals, buythe Chilton's guide and get some of your auto repairs doneyourself. It isn't an FSM - no Chilton's manual comparesto an FSM - but it's better on avergae than Haynes' guides andit won't get you into deep water without ample warnings."
1,Not for the amateur mechanic!,"This is the second Chilton repair manual I have bought and so far, the thing is hopelessly confusing. The directions in print most often do not coincide with the photos or diagrams that are posted along side of it. Also instructions like ""remove so and so, remove so and so, loosen so and so"" is not helpful at all if it doesn't you don't know what so and so are. Perhaps this is a great manual for a mechanic that's never worked on a certain car before, or for the garage mechanic that knows his well around underneath a hood very well, But I am neither of these and to me, the manual has been about 10% useful. But I have bough a Haynes manual for a old acura and have done extensive work with that manual and it didn't leave me hanging a 1/4 of the amount of times that this thing has. REALLY REALLY REALLY wish I had bought the Haynes."
4,1995-99 chilton's repair manual for 1995 ford contour,Book was in good condition.After I received the book I paid more for it on line than I could have bought it at your store. I paid 7.87 for it. It had a sticker price of 4.25 on front cover.In the future I will think twice before I but anything on line from amazon.ThanksAnthony Barnes
5,A Must Have Book for all Christians,"""Fast Facts on False Teachings"" is an amazing concise, yet complete offering of the many false doctrine and horrible teachings that are rampant in America. For those who want a nice one-book reference to look at the Far Eastern religions, Mormonism, Witnesses, New Age Faiths, Islam and more--and learn how disparate they are from orthodox Christianity--this is a superb addition to your library. Decker and Carlson ""tell it like it is"" in a very easy-to-understand manner!"
1,False facts,"This is the most ridiculous book I have ever read.It brands everything as false if it does not agree with the bible. Why bother writing a book. Just say that everything is false,if it is not in the bible.Besides this book is full of erroneous facts that any gullible person reading this book would take it as true.This book should have been titled 'FALSE FACTS about other religions'. There are too many arrors to list here. It is not even worth the paper it is printed on."
1,not received,"I'm sure it was delivered somewhere, there is a tracking the number that the post office confirms, but we never received the books. I believe the error was on the post office's part and not on the sellers part."
4,Very Good Just to see the Basics.,"I read some of the other reviews of this book and thought, that one was based on one Chapter, and one was dissing it because ONE thing he said in the book was ""untrue"". Which doesn't make any sense.This book is for the most part very educational. He may sometimes over exagerate on things, but who doesn't. Most have for christians every where."
1,The most closed minded book ever written...,"The facts written in this book have no background other then the Christian opinion of the authors Ron Carlson and Ed Decker. They mention that evolution is a lie and is scientifically impossible. It also comments that if you believe that you are a biproduct of evolution then you should behave like animals. Well, I think apes have more self respect then whoever thinks that. I am a Christian and have no problem accepting that when god created the earth it was done not by magic but by manipulating the elements in the best fashion to create men. This book offers as a quick fix for the closed minded if you ask me, and if you are truly curious about ""false teachings"" then you should take the time to learn for your self, since the questions you are asking are the most important in your life, right?"
3,Only read about the Masons,"I have a friend who recently became a Mason. I remembered that Masons were talked about in this book. So I read the section on Masons. I made copies of that sections and my friend confirmed everything about the initiation ceremony and beliefs. He literally just went through his initiation the night before. That alone confirmed this section for me. I have not read the other sections, so I cannot attest to the validity or accuracy of the rest of the book. But the sections on Freemasonry is legit."
4,Great but disappointed,Purchased this book because I am always interested in learning more about falseteachings. Found many of the chapters well done. But! Having said that; I also felt the title 'False Teachings' somewhat misleading. Didn't feel that Buddhism (a major religion) or Catholicism (a major Christian faith) belonged in a book which mainly concerns itself with W.I.C.C.A. and other 'accepted' cults.
3,Needs to be updated,"As a college professor and a teacher of cults I have used this book on a number of occassions. I used it because it is extremely basic and very readable. Having used it lately I think I will use something different next time in my teaching. Here are the reasons:1. The section on Roman Catholicism is very good and shows its extreme cult-""ness"" while giving no real meat in the prosperity theology section. They do point out its great problems but I feel that whichever gentleman wrote that section did not know about the Word-Faith movement enough to elaborate.2. It needs to be updated. Sections on Satanism are talking about music groups that used to be and TV shows that are no more.I could go on a little more but I think you get the point. Still a good basic book."
4,Good overview...,"Sound info here.. I was a bit concerned with the, 'bashing' feel to the groups here but most of the facts the authors presented did correlate with other books I've read dealing with, 'False beliefs'"
5,great massage oil,Biotone is such a high quality produce. This oil has great glide during my massage treatment. I will continue to use Biotone even through it is more expensive than other oils out there.
5,Nice light massage oil,"Great product, no scent, goes on easily. I'd buy it again. Perfect for a massage. Not much more to say about this product though."
4,A Comprehensive and Practical Reference for the Practioner,"The size and weight of this book caused me to think twice because the combination of those features often suggest more than a fair amount of techno speak,often more satisfying for the writer than the reader. The weight of this book is pure muscle, written for the user...clear, understandable and comprehensive. If you are interested in global organizational performance, I found the treatment of the subject very useful and well done. As it turns out, the weight of the book has a complimentary benefit i.e. eliminating at least one trip to the gym, I can now build both strength and knowledge without having to take a gym shower. It may not be a benefit for everyone, but the Handbook for HTP will provide value for those who are serious about this subject...."
1,New Theory for Western Medicine,"To begin with, there is no way this book was edited. There are so many typos I still can't figure out the meaning of some of the sentences.But that's not the worst part. Before I got a third into the book, I was sick of her hypocritical, neurotic, egocentric rants. In one sentence she whines about being a woman in the good ole boy system of medical research, and in the next sentence, she talks about fellow male scientists as ""hunks"" and broods over what to wear to work to differentiate herself from the hired help.Add to that the fact that what the author claims to have discovered has been known by Ayurveda for at least 10,000 years, and you get a 1 Star book. Her foreword is written by Deepak Chopra, she claims later in her book to have discussion about Ayurveda with friends and others in the know, and yet she still makes statements like this?The only good part was the way she exposed the game playing and hubris of Western medicine scientific research."
1,One of the most irritating books I have ever tried to read.,"I sought out this book because I was looking for a layperson's introduction to the topic of its title, written by an expert in the field.What I got was a repellent mishmash of personal and professional bitterness mixed with superficial counterculture spiritualism, with occasional nuggets of experimental brilliance tossed in like raisins in a halfbaked pudding.I'm glad I only checked this book out from the library, because I will never purchase it. Instead, I will track down Pert's original journal articles in Current Contents, and slog my way through them. It will be slower going, but at least I'll know the material underwent peer review before it was published.""The Double Helix"" it ain't."
2,"Title is misleading: Good Hook, Chopra's Name, Nice Cover","I bought this book in hardcover because it had a fascinating title by someone who was billed as a top researcher. It starts with a story that trashes her PhD mentor using his name (bad form I would think, doesn't government funded research have more constructive avenues to dispute discoveries?). Then it jumps to the holistic part but not with the science you would expect from someone billed as a high caliber scientist. There is better science to holistic medicine that does not require one to be a ""believer"". I thought I was going to find it here. Recommend Hobson's book as well."
2,Dissapointingly Deceiving,"If you are in search of an autobiography of a dedicated and intrinsically emotional scientist, then this is the book for you. However, if truly interested in the actual neuroscience this book claims to teach, search for a more nonfictional and scientific work. Pithy factual information of such molecules of emotion is obstructed with unnecessary personal dramatics and stories loosely tied to the intended subject matter. While the book provides insight to the life of a cutting-edge scientist, the autobiographical nature obscures the supposed purport of the book: to teach the neuroscience of emotions."
1,Perhaps this is why Ms. Pert left the sciences.,"This was a puzzling book for me. Dr. Pert's rage at her scientific mentors seems to boil up unbidden at every turn.I recently read a well-researched study that may help the reader understand why Dr. Pert has apparently left the natural sciences, although she did last longer than many have.The book that reports this study is Elaine Seymour's ""Talking About Leaving: Why Undergraduates Leave the Sciences""."
2,The autohagiography of a scientist seeking canonisation.,"A very political book, whose recurrent theme is ""I thought of it all first, and they ignored me!"" Lots of self-justifying language from a predatory researcher who also happens to be brilliant.It's definitely worth reading, but it's also quite annoying to read."
5,An absolutely fabolous book!,"It has been a truly positive experince to read the book and enter into the world of neuropeptides and the life of Candace Pert. The book is a clear cut perfect introduction into the magic of the interaction between emotions and the 60 or so information subatances that circulates in our body. Besides writing a very good popular science Candace Pert is also a person with a wonderful sense of humor - very needed indeed in her struggle with the science alpha males. It is impossible to feel anything but great admiration for the powerful Pert. She has one foot in the old and new paradigm and walks confidently ahead. I look forward to follow her work. Susanna Ehdin, PhD"
5,Molecules of Emotions by Candace B. Pert,I found her book to be very mind expanding to say the very least. The very idea that our emotions effect our bodies immune system is very useful to each and every one of us. I will read this book over and over because the ideas are so new to me that it will take time to fully digest all this new material that I find not only useful but necessary for our health and well being. Bill Montague
4,Very Interesting,"I really liked the information. I wish she had focused more on the information vs. her struggles as a scientist in a male dominated field. When she did share information on the evolution of findings on the subject, it was very interesting."
2,Mostly an autobiography,"I was disappointed in this book. Candace Pert's other books are pretty good. This book came highly recommended, but I don't know why. The information in this book that has anything to do with the title could be coverd in 40 or 50 pages and that information is good. However, the other 250 pages of the book is a autobiography. I am not one that likes or wishes to read autobiographies nor do I like authors mislabeling the titles of their books to get me to purchase them just to read 300 pages of selfagrandizing material trying to find the information that is realted to the title.The information in this book has been covered in many other books and better. Unless you want to read the autobiography of Candance Pert, save your money and time."
2,a book about peptides...oh wait no really it's a book about Candace Pert,"this book need serious editing to make it readableI was looking for a book about peptides, after having seen Candace Pert in What the Bleep, instead I found an annoying autobiography, read (waded through) only the first 50 pages that mostly were a string of ""me, me, me and then maybe the way others see me"" with little about peptides between the meI respect Candace Pert as a scientist, that's why I'm giving two stars instead of one, but seriously, she's a self centered writer and that takes a lot away from the wonderful work she's done"
4,intriguing,"Very interesting how the body, mind and emotions are not separate, but definitely impact each other, not in a linear way, but in a complex relational way"
1,Very disappointing,"I don't have much to add to the other comments in the ""1-star"" category. Not only is the author condescending by constantly referring to her colleauges as ""we scientists"", her style is irritating and unfocused, and spends half the book not so much speaking about the actual ""molecules of emotion"", but her fuzzy ideas about how they align with the prana and chi of Indian and Chinese mythology respectively.There are many other better books, as others have noted. Oliver Sacks writes well for the layperson, and doesn't get drawn into the holistic school of alternative therapy."
3,Molecules of Emotion from Lucy's Standpoing,I purchased this on the recommendation of a friend. I have always been such a skeptic about Chakra's but remain open to new ideas including this. I haven't been home enough to read the book as much as I would like to but expect that it will make good evening reading as the days grow shorter. When I have read it takes a while for the material to sink in and I find I need to ponder each concept some before moving on.
1,Bad Science,"Reading this book was a saddening experience. I don't believe that true personal or planetary healing will ever occur so long as our brothers of the animal kingdom are being killed and mutilated in our search for better health. I found Candace's justifications for experimenting on animals patronizing and arrogant. Refusing to kill animals in the name of science isn't about being squeamish, it's about being compassionate. Monkeys brains really didn't need to be put in a blender to discover the obvious - that there are strong emotional links to disease. And women don't need to be as cruel as their most heartless male collegues to 'prove' anything to them. It's going to take some people with great hearts as well as great minds to make the big steps needed for the healing of humanity."
4,"Good Science, Bad Manners","This book is a great read for anyone interested in corporate power structure and the price that is often exacted from the public. The idea that cures may be lost or thwarted in the heat of one's personal glory is not new; it's painful to read nonetheless.As a mother of an insulin dependent diabetic, I know in my heart that profitable science is where the big boys play and research money still goes to what can best be marketed to the masses. Much of this book makes you cringe.Still the flow of ideas, how teams came together, the actual science on neuropeptides and receptors and emotions, are all fascinating and well written. The book is informative, instructive, entertaining and worth the time and investment.It is one that is on my shelf and comes off every once in a while for a re-read. It's that good."
5,Mind-body Communication,"Molecules Of Emotion: The Science Behind Mind-Body Medicine by Candace B. Pert is a book that tells it like it is through the authors eyes. She feels the science establishment is a world rules by forceful, brutal, males fighting for the top prize. She since has embraced the Christian faith and discovered the healing powers of dreams. The author explains how the material world of molecules are linked with the non-material world of the psyche. The book also describes an eight-part program for a healthy lifestyle.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Are You In Spiritual Darkness Or Are You On The Path To Enlightenment? +++++++++++++++ +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
3,Autobiography of a scientist,"This book is an autobiography of a scientist, and by all accounts Candace was a good scientist and I think her story was worth telling. I would like if she had summarised the biochemistry in appendix A, and her own personal experience with complementary medicine in appendix B."
3,More like a novel,"This certainly is a book for those who like novels.Suggestion for the rest of us who do not like novels: Just skip all the drama by scanning rapidly through the text.You could find very informative data scattered here and there.Especially, the last two chapters, which are most interesting.Take out the drama and the book could be written in less than 100 pages."
5,Molecules of Emotion,Loved this book. She makes understanding the science behind emotions very easy. I recommend this book for anyone wanting to heal themselves naturally. It's actually a fun book to read.
3,Autobiography of a Scientist,"After reading about Candace Pert's discoveries in numerous magazine articles, I decided to read her book to learn more. What I learned about was Candace Pert. The book contains information about the biology of emotions, but it is embedded in a narrative of Dr. Pert's life as a scientist. Though the story is an interesting one, it was a disappointment for someone looking for a layperson's introduction to the molecules of emotions."
4,It's all up here.(Points to temple.),"This book is one of those rare finds that, through the sheer ability of the author,awakens an interest in a subject that the reader had previously shown little curiosity about. I learned alot from reading it and will read anything this author publishes. Its a great read for the layman or professional. No matter who you are you can only stand to profit from reading this fine book"
3,Autobiography or science?,"I couldn't tell if this was an autobiography or a book on science data. It seemed the author had more to tell about herself, and what an ego, than to medical input and information. I didn't care to hear about how excited the author got over a filling auditorium before she spoke. She could have cut out most of her personal quests, and made the book more useful and less convoluted. However, with some sorting and highlighting, one could find the information useful."
1,autobiography of a former scientist turned true believer.,"""Why I Feel the Way I Feel"" might have been a better subtitle. Focuses primarily on the author's unsuccessful struggle to gain the upper hand in an extremely competitive and cutthroat research culture, along with her reasons for giving it up and becoming one of a holistic-medicine guru's more prominent followers. Of more interest to the true believer than to the mainstream reader. Rather short on scientific explanation."
2,Should be renamed the molecules of Emotional Egos,"The title is fascinating and every now and then the author provides some interesting insights into how neuropeptides and emotions are related. Unfortuately, she spends most of the book talking about her life and little about the science or even the theories of emotion. Her science appears very narrow and limited to her work and she misses in educating the reader about the role of simpler things such as steroids and the immune system.She does not address her own basic motivations for life, which appears to be to get recognition for her work (the recognition is much more important than the quality or nature of the work). I would hope that her next book focuses on the science of emotions since she failed to discuss some of the more interesting emotions related to the key events in her life (marriage, divorce, childbirth, rejection) and how these emotions are needed for human survival."
3,Great content but required sifting,"I have been reading some great books by Dr Joe Dispenza on the Mindbody field and he quoted Candace Pert's book 'The Molecules of Emotion'. So I decided to track down a copy and read it.I found parts of the book very informative, but as another reader has suggested there was a lot of other 'story' to wade through to get to the heart of the information. I found myself skimming through parts of the book that went way off topic and didn't add a lot of relevance or context to the discussion.So all in all a good read. She has done some amazing work in the field to bridge the gap between science and the bodymind teachings and experience through the ages. So I take my hat off to her. Though I would have preferred a book more focused on her findings, as opposed to covering her personal story and journey through the male-dominated halls of the NIH."
2,"Interesting insider info, but lacking in coherent structure","This is a history book. Do not kid yourself into thinking that it has value as political science. Kurtz presents an entire string of some interesting (plus some disturbing) anecdotes about modern relations between the press and the White House, but he culminates in no particular point. It just ends up being a timeline of the president and the press bickering . . . for 300+ pages! The lack of guiding thesis leaves the reader with an impression of sorts, but any point that Kurtz tried to make ends up being too elusive and intangible. The best use I can see for this book is to inform a hermit as to what went on in presidential politics from 92-98, other than that, its just more gossip."
1,Could have been written in 5 pages,This book was very dissappointing. It contained very little new information for anyone who watches C-Span. It is a mish mash of stories loosely organized without any analysis. I suppose if you had no idea any of this was going on it would be informative. Definitely not worth a whole book but a 5 page analysis piece.
3,White House Spokesmen Not Forthcoming? Say It's not True!,"The revelations in this book are astonishing! My god, you mean to tell me that the president of the United States actually sends people out to talk to the press to put himself in a positive light? You mean to tell me that the white house spokesmen we see on tv aren't telling us everything that's going on? Are you telling me they are concealing things and sometimes even embellishing certain events to avoid negative public opinion. Why, this is outrageous!Mr. Kurtz, you are a saint for revealing the decietful practices of these scoundrels. The world would have simply continued accepting everything these ""spokesmen"" were saying at face value if you had not written your invaluably enlightening book. And please keep appearing on my tv everyday and writing more books to talk about the excessive punditry going on these days."
3,The Second Rough Draft of History,"Kurtz takes us behind the curtain into the space where reporters and political spinmeisters make the news, like factory workers building widgets. There are strategies to be followed, products to be pushed, and lies to be told -- artfully.The book is good, but not great. Like most journalistic works, it has more of a he-said, she-said type of writing style that works best in newspapers but not as well in a three hundred page narrative...We'll have to wait 10 or 20 years probably for the Doris Kearns Goodwin edition of the Clinton years...Now that will be the book to get."
3,average example of political power of the media,"""Spin Cycle"" makes an excellent illustration of the political prowess of the media and the White House's approach to using the media to portray information. Despite this success, the quality of the book is quite unsatisfactory. ""Spin Cycle"" fails horribly at portraying consistent and accurate information relating to the actions of the Clinton White House. Many examples used in the book were later proven to be false allegations. The book is a necessary read for any student of American Politics interesting in the influence of the media. On the other hand, this book would probably not be a satisfactory read for any reader interested in learning accurate information of the Clinton White House."
1,Inferior Product and Disappointing Musicianship,The playing is fatigued and uninspired and the musicianship is embarassing. Amazon.com should be ashamed of even offering this CD.
4,A good sampler,"What this CD essentially aspires to is not a listening device, but instead a companion to Mr. Mandel's ""Future Jazz"" theories and foresights. Spot-on they are, and this compilation is fine quality and tune, but noticably inconsistant. It will not make you a fan, but it will surely make you curious and athirst for more of the same. A fine and recommended purchase."
3,Oh Well... Average I guess...,Ummm. Okay this song is actually okay. In fact it's one of songs that Mariah does well when singing. But I don't like it when she whispers or having that high pitched voice. I mean even a dog could easily get pissed a mile away if it heard that sound. No offence I am a Mariah fanatic. But she sounds okay here overall. But Busta does okay as well. Though he can't get a tune pretty well as Mariah. But this songs nice to have a spin to anyway. But don't take my word. Please listen to the songs and then make up your mind okay? Mariah you still have my support... Especially with your new album.
2,average,you would think with the MR.Biggs Concept in place that Busta&Mariah would come up with a Better cut but this is fairly safe.the scary part of this Song is that Mariah Carey is the Singer but Busta sounds better Singing than She does&He can't even Sing.the Music is cool.
3,Would be better if they didn't use Tintin's name,"I am getting sick of all those stories that claim reference to Tintin but distort the character so much that they bear no resemblance to it. Breaking Free is definitely the worst, but this comes a close second. It's not that it's not interesting. As a novel, it stands on its own as delivering some thought-provoking philosophy and ideas. I wish though that the author just invented some new characters instead of stealing Tintin and Haddock. The novel reminds me of Candide - a philosophical allegory of sorts. But there is no need to stick Tintin in there."
1,Hergé Would Not Have Approved...,"I know the original series of books inside out. I began reading them for the first time at nine in English, then rediscovered them more than a decade later in French class. Regardless of language, they were easy to read, easy to follow, funny, witty and all the while exciting.I was more than pleasantly surprised to find this book on a shelf, then more than a little disappointed once I began to read it. I always thought that the Hergé estate was very careful about licencing the name and image of Tintin so as to protect and preserve the artist's creation; not in this case. This Tintin, published ten year's after the artist's death, really has little in common with the original character. Somebody over there was not doing their job when this was allowed to happen!"
1,Philosophical Drivel,"If there was less than 1 star I would give it about a 5th of a star.Apparently this book is out of print or hard to get your hands on. And that's not a bad thing!I picked this book up from my local library several years ago and read it. I was sucked in thinking it would be a great Tintin, just in novel form. This book was terribly boring and philosphical, it took an extreme amount of effort to read one page and keep reading. Being the fool that I am, I kept reading thinking it would get better, it didn't.If you are a Tintin fan this will really disappoint and make you wonder how it was ever allowed to be published.If philosophical trash is your thing and you don't care less about Tintin then it's your choice.As for me, I think the book stinks.Don't say I didn't warn you!"
1,Painful...,"The reason most people pick this book up is because of the ""Tintin"" connection. It's the reason I obviously did. Before I rip into this book, I want to note that it is very true that you cannot compare the Tintin in this book and the real Tintin comics. However, like many of you, I couldn't help but be curious as to how the author would represent him in a novel format (as he was reported to have been a good friend of Herge). The answer...in an extremely boring and uninteresting manner. The dialogue goes nowhere, the topics of discussion are plain dull and the characters are unlikable. I managed to get through 50 pages but couldn't continue. So, if you're a Tintin fan as I am, don't bother with this book as you will be sorely dissapointed...unless you happen to have find it at a used book store ... like I did. ..."
1,"Awful, spoils Tintin's character.","This is by far the worst book I have ever read. I am a huge fan of Tintin, and this book takes the boyhood reporter's image, crumples it up, and throws it into grown-up novel filled with profoundly stupid elements to Tintin's timeless character. The point that Georges Remi (or Herge, Tintin's inventor) tried to make is that Tintin should never be put into the 'new world', or a world of sex and cultural realism. The reason people gave this book good reviews is quite simply because they are not familiar with Tintin's image. Tuten's writing may be well done, but the choice of putting poor Tintin at the subject of this schmaltzy drooling romance is completely ridiculous and infuriating for Tintin fans."
2,"Interesting experiment, not so great execution","I really don't know what Tuten was trying to do here - there are some passages in this book that really got me, like the extended fantasy/dream of Tintin's future life with Clavdia... but too often the book wanders about in ever-decreasing circles of philosophical gibberish. It's not a HORRIBLE book UNLESS you are expecting it to have ANYTHING in common with Herge's work, and then you will totally HATE IT. It almost would have been better as a straight novel without the Tintin-character pastiches."
1,Buy it for the cover only,"I bought this book 7 years ago and it's only now that I've had the opportunity to finally read it for the first time. What a disappointment:( What was Mr Tuten's editor thinking when he or she reviewed the manuscript? The book is boring, the psychobabble may interest Psych101 students but for fans of Tintin like myself, it was a major letdown."
2,"Low-brow of the supposed ""greatest hits""","From the Arista ""what were they thinking?"" files, here comes a collection that was only released to make an extra buck or two. The lone track that is hard to find on CD is ""Bouncing"" (from the ""In the Name of Love"" album). All the rest are on other ""Greatest Hits"" packages... or throwaways that most fans own anyway.If you're looking for the BEST compilation of Twins hits... try the far more superior ""Love, Lies, and Other Strange Things"".This CD, unfortunately, will not even please the most hardcore of Thompson Twins fans."
2,"Interesting, but....","One of the numerous Thompson Twins compilations floating around out there, this one is one of the only ones that plays like somebody's Thompson Twins mix tape. It's unusual to see ""Day After Day"" included on a greatest hits comp, especially because it really IS one of their best songs, and wasn't a single. ""Emperor's Clothes"" was an album track too, although the fact that it's not one of their greatest hits arouses suspicion. Ditto for ""Bouncing"", a track off their 1982 album ""Set"" (released in the US as ""In The Name Of Love""). They even delve into ""Close to the Bone"" territory and dig up ""Perfect Day"", even though ""Get That Love"" was the single. The inclusion of some halfhearted liner notes doesn't help to make the case for this collection, and the packaging seals its doom...a xerox-machine combination of the Thompson Twins and a brick wall. Eccch."
5,The best of all the Star Trek video novelizations,"""Star Trek IV"" remains my favorite Star Trek movie of all time, the combination of humor, social message and action make it a great story. This book is an excellent novelization of the movie, McIntyre captures the events with just the right amount of poetic license in converting the on-screen action into words. In my opinion, this is the best literary adaptation of any Star Trek video, if you pay very close attention you will recognize some differences between the book and the movie, but in my opinion, they only serve to make the book better."
2,not as good as i had hoped,"I bought this book thinking it would be more of a hands on aspect of engineering. More than anything, its an encyclopaedia of studio stuff. I assumed it would have a chapter on getting huge drum tracks, or making your vocals really sparkle, but, unfortunatly, it doesn't even really have real how to stuff. I'm glad I bought it used, I would have died knowing I payed full price for this book."
5,Complete from basic to advanced,"I am an amateur musician trying to cope with the advances in digital sound and music productions. This book is a complete guide from scratch, allowing you to learn the basic foundations, standard skills and advanced tips.It provides basic knowledge and advanced tips. It should be an essential for any person interest in recording."
5,This book is a MUST HAVE!,"With so many horribly written books on the market, particularly those pertaining to technology, I am absolutely thrilled with Modern Recording Techniques! As someone with a significant background as both a musician and in technology, I've had almost no experience in audio recording. This book not only clarifies things that have befuddled my feeble mind for many years (smile), but also does an incredibly effective job at explaining concepts that are completely new to me. Examples are well chosen and the few downloadable tutorials provided on the author's web site for this book are, while simple, also very effective.While I'm still working my way through this book, I can already say that it is going to be one of those that I will continue to use and refer to for a very long time. With that in mind, I would give this book ten stars, if that were possible. Thanks!"
3,Introduction guide,"Modern? As a reprint this book is getting pretty old now and would really benefit from some new material. I'm also not sure who the audience is meant to be. It's too generalised to appeal to someone who understands the fundamentals of recording and yet would probably scare off someone who is relatively new to the subject.The format is very text bookish and is let down by the lack of solid tips, techniques and examples that would have bought this otherwise ordinary book to life.Unless you have the luxury of already owning all the other recording books advertised on Amazon I would shunt this one further down the list."
3,Good for beginners,This is a good overview if you are new to the industry. Lack of detailed information limits its usability if you already have some experience. I would recommend Yamaha's Sound Reinforcement Handbook and Bobby Owsinski's Mixing and Mastering Engineer's handbooks over this for more specific tips.
4,"Solid commentary, good insights","Use this every week as a preach through Mark. I use inductive Bible study and other commentaries to help me flesh out the meaning of the text but this commentary format with 'Bridging Contexts' and 'Contemporary Significance' helps me think through how to preach the passage. There are occasional illustrations I find useful as well. Garland's preaching segments are a good start for deciding how many verses to tackle. Often they are too large, but it's a place to start.This is the 2nd NIV Application Commentary I have used. Liked them both. (Recommend Exodus by Peter Enns)"
5,Ranma 1/2 ending,"Now first of all, I am the biggest Ranma 1/2 fan out there. I have the first five season and OVAs, and the three movies. I don't like you guys saying bad things about this dvd, even though I haven't seen the dvd. So I don't know if it's all that good or bad, but I've read about it many times. Let's pray, and maybe when Rumiko Takahashi finishes the manga, they might actually make all the other stories animated and hopefully, a much more proper ending. Also maybe introduce other characters, like Akari."
4,Okay ending for the Anime,"Fans of the Ranma 1/2 Manga, please understand that the anime is different from the Manga. Kitty productions did not follow the guidelines for the Manga which is why you never see an episode with Herb, Mint, Lime, or Ryu and why Gosunkugi didn't appear until the 6th season. If you want to see the ending you've been waiting awhile for, then I'm afraid you'll have to wait for volume 38 which might not come out until the year 2008 (hopefully faster)."
3,lileks has better stuff elsewhere,"overall, i'm a big fan of lileks, but this is not his greatest book. it got really boring after a while and it felt like he wasn't even trying. the gallery of regrettable food and mommy knows worst are hysterical. definitely check out his website too."
5,I Laughed So Hard I Hurt Myself,"And I gave everyone I know copies for Christmas. Everyone needs to read this book.And by the way, if you liked this, you'll also likeDaydream Houses of Los Angelesby Charles Jencks."
3,Fun look back at a hideous decade in Interior Decoration!,This book is full of amazing pictures that illustrate just how awful the 70's were as far as decor. Some funny dialogue to go along with the visuals.
4,As funny to read as to flip thru,"Not the best picture quality, but such funny pictures. The 70s indeed were a time of horrible home decor that stayed with many of us well into the 90s and remodeling time. Witty text that is as funny as the photos."
5,We laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed,"This book was hilarious, almost without letup. I don't know if you had to be there -- in those houses, in the '70's, when we kids _knew_ something wasn't adding up -- but James Lileks just hits the nail on the head. We laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed. This is his funniest book."
3,not what I expected...,"Almost all the images in this book are from the 1975 Better Homes and Gardens Decorating book. Since I already own that book, I was pretty let down by this one. The author is witty and it is a fun look at bad decorating, but I would suggest buying the original Better Homes and Garden if you can find it. What saved this book from being a total waste of money is: my guests seem to like to look through it..."
4,What I needed.,Never use adapters. This was the length I needed. I would prefer the super heavy duty that the cable companies use but this was the right price and works just fine.
5,Author Marty P,"As author of this title, I would like to respond to the posted review which refers to the printing error. Unfortunately a portion of the first printing of my book included manufacturing errors. This has since been corrected and I can assure you currently all of the examples are readable. If you have a first printing of the book and think it may have errors, please return it to your reseller or contact the publisher at ptr_feedback@phptr.com for a corrected copy of the title. The publisher and I apologize for any inconvenience caused."
4,"spirituality, group delusion and the perils of research","""Imaginary Friends"" deals with spirituality, group delusion and the strange flowers of thought blooming in isolated conditions. It takes the old myth of the 'hidden people' and impresses it on a small, benign cult not dissimilar to Heaven's Gate set in an ordinary neighbourhood in an ordinary little town.Two sociologists join the cult to research small-group phenomena and are increasingly drawn into the interactions and rituals of the cult as events escalate. The Coming is prophesied and tensions rise, culminating in the breakdown of the main researcher and and a lull in the cult's proceedings. Yet, the story continues....The novel raises valid observations on conducting research and the blurring of lines between observer and participant; the characters are eminently believable, which made this an enjoyable read."
3,What separates faith from psychosis?,"The is a story of two sociologists who embark upon a research project to infiltrate and observe a small cult which claims to be in contact with higher beings from outerspace. Instead of focusing too much on the exact identities of the members of the cult itself and its somewhat ridiculous belief system, the story hones in on the reactions and behaviors of the two sociologists who try (with varying degrees of sucess and failure) to participate ""non-directively"" in the group. Each researcher finds himself struggling (consciously or not) with the ideas of how much of group belonging can determine identity, and how much identity which emmanates from within can influence the group identity.It's not clear by the end of the story just what separates faith and determination from delusions of grandeur and compulsion. But it was this question, not the story itself, that remained in my mind long after I finished the book."
4,"Funny, Original, Unexpected and Enduring",I'm reading this novel for the 2nd time.It was first published in 1967 and is a gem. Read it. You'll thank me.
4,Great for blues novices,"I heard one of Mr. Taylor's songs at the end of ""The Shooter"" and was so moved I searched for his music to learn more. As a classic rock and classic country afficianado you might say I'm a little out of my league writing a review on Taylor's work. His music is soulful, deep, blues-y, full of emotion, powerful and thought provoking. I put the CD in my truck (I did say I'm a country fan afterall!) and lose myself in the lyrics as I travel down the road. I'll be buying more Otis Taylor and suggest you do the same."
5,just real music,"I first heard Otis Taylor in 2003/4 while living aboard my sailboat in the US Virgin Islands. I won a compliation CD in a radio contest. His song, My Soul's in Louisiana, quickly became my favorite track. I recently watched the movie ""Shooter"" and heard his style once more played at the end during the credits. There was no question who it was and I have no doubt I will never hear music the same way!"
5,Standing up for creativity!,"I believe that as consumers of mass media, we all value our freedom to choose to read, watch, or listen to whatever we desire. But what would happen if the planet we call Earth became a totalitarian state where the expression of creativity is utterly forbidden? That is the premise of ""Gulliver's Fugitives.""In the first Next Generation audio book ever made, read by Jonathan Frakes (Riker), the away team encounters an underground movement of individuals, much like that found in the movie ""Demolition Man"", who seek to restore the imagination to its proper place of value. This story is an excellent take on censorship and First Amendment issues."
1,The Worst Star Trek Novel I've Read,"Once the series had ended, (at least for the time being), and I'd purchased all the DVD's and seen every episode at least 3 times, (I even liked the Enterprise series), I finally started reading the books. This is by far the worst I've read so far. It has numerous plot holes and it makes the characters like Captian Picard and Data appear inept and foolish. Coucelor Troy is portrayed as a quasi-visionary. To top it all off, the story appears to be contrived and obnoxiously politically motivated, (unlike some of its more subtle predecessors).It portrays an advanced civilization of humans that fled Earth and bases its beliefs on quote ""the Christian Bible"" to the exclusion of any other beliefs and that has banned all fiction. It's very 'un-Star Trek' to blatantly single out one religion and attack it so viciously."
3,Not quite literature,"While I thought the 1984-ish culture was an interesting (and impossible) one, the story gets bogged down in psychadelics as Troi and others hallucinate mythological creatures. The surprise at the end makes for a good (and again, highly unlikely) climax, and the supporting characters are fun, if superfluous. A good little romp, but you'll have to suspend disbelief a little more than usual."
1,This book is boring.,"Where is this book going? Somehow Picard and others get on a planet, that is in a midst of a war. Then some of them are taken prisoner. Dr. Pulaski does make an appearence in this book, but she is only medicore, not the quick witted doctor that we met in the series. This book is boring and confusing, I do not recommend it. Anyways, what does Gulliver's Fugitives mean, I never understood that."
5,What Time Can Do,"I have to be one of Aaliyah's biggest fans. When she first debuted I was only five years old but, I loved the song back and forth. Now I am 15 and It seems as if Aaliyah did sooo much changing. She went from singing about going back and forth to I care for you. I think that this would have to be some of Aaliyah's greatest work. Especially since she had a hand in producing it.Aaliyah Dana HaughtonJanuary 15, 1979 - August 25, 2001I Miss You Aaliyah!!!From Your Biggest Fan Quentashia Darbins"
3,This is a book review on the Star Trek Voyager #1 Caretaler,"I do not intend to give any parts of the book away because it is a book that is worth reading, and I hope anyone whom may be reading this review will read it. The way it begins will be very confusing if you have no background on Voyager. But it introduces some characters namely Harry Kim, Tom Paris, and Even Quark very well. My favorite part in the book was an incident with Harry Kim when Quark tries to sell him ""momentos from DS9"" and when Harry replies that he was warned about Ferengi, Quark acts offended and thus sells the product. This was presented from the view of Tom Paris at the beginning of the book. Overall I would give this book three stars. And a pretty good rating."
5,Amazing even though its based on a program.,"This novel I bought before Star Trek Voyager came to British television. I read it, and then I read it again. I could remember it all but I was just in a daze. If all the Voyager novels were as detailed and enthralling as this I would collect the whole series. They were not. I had read this this novel five times before the episode came to BBC2 and I just thought ""Wow. How coud someone write such an excellent novel from that!"". The truth was the novel was far superior than the program it was based on, not a usual occurrance. The characters are decribed excellently and I felt I knew them by the time I had finished reading the novel. After watching Caretaker on our television I still went back and read the novel a few more times, it was so great"
3,Don't read this until you've seen the TV episode.,"This is just a novel form of the TV script. Unless you're really hooked on this story, move on to the Voyager books that are original."
3,SO SO,"Nothing to scream about as it is just a sticker, but it met my needs for the time being. Good price and received quickley."
2,outside window decal,The product is adequate as a decal applied to a window exterior. It is not as usable as the available gel type applications that allow viewing from both sides of glass and therefore work well applied to the interior of a car window.
3,Form over function,"The William Bounds Universal Flaxseed Mill is elegant-looking, but somewhat difficult to use. The ceramic grinding mechanism works fairly well for flaxseed. It takes 25-30 twists to grind 1/2 teaspoon. However, the curved top does not offer much grip. The cap must be removed for each use, a flip-top or pop-top that stays attached would be a huge improvement. I prefer to store my flaxseed in the refrigerator between uses, for longer shelf life, but the glass bottom becomes very slippery with condensation when removed for use. A different material or non-slip coating would have worked much better."
3,Not for Flax,"This might be perfectly fine for spices, but for flax seed it's a joke. Most of the seeds come out whole for your trouble. I was disappointed because I love that the storage compartment is glass. Upgrade the grinder mechanism and it would be wonderful."
2,Skip This One,"The last time I listened to Jeff Healey on record it was See The Light on vinyl. When I listened to this CD, I was disappointed, especially as the first four tracks are from See The Light. The sound quality on this ""re-mastered"" CD could be much better. Arista/BMG has failed to improve on the original recording. Jeff's vocals are too low in the mix, with too much reverb. I had been looking forward to this one. I'm going to try listening to See The Light on CD. Or maybe I'll go back to the vinyl. . ."
3,Not All Of His Best,"This is a hit & miss collection of Healey's ""best."" Includes essentials like ""Confidence Man"" & ""See the Light"", but also includes filler such as ""Angel Eyes"" & ""Lost in Your Eyes."" Healey was at his ""best"" when he was playing all-out blues-rockers, not ballads. By the way, where is ""I Think I Love You Too Much""?"
4,Most Jeff Healey songs are always good,I really like this CD because it has a lot of the best songs from the lst and 2nd CD except for my favorite song which is I think I love you too much Jeff's songs always have a strong southern rock background which i relly like.
5,I relate to him,I could not put this book down once I started reading it. I too have many health problems related to Dursban pesticide. I like the author had been to many doctors with the same results. Thank You Jacob Berkson for telling your story. I will share this book with others.
2,STRONG CHEMICAL ODOR INSIDE POT!,"This is indeed a nice looking pot!Unfortunately, there is a strong chemical odor inside the pot. It appears to stem from the inside coating of the pot.In this country about 70,000 different chemicals are being used. The side effects and toxicity of these chemicals are generally never studied. In my opinion, the strong chemical odor inside this pot is a very bad sign. I threw the pot in the trash because I do not want to be exposed to potentially toxic chemicals that could enter into my drinking water from this pot.My previous ceramic water dispenser that I bought from Culligan Waters had NO chemical odor on the inside!"
4,Saves a lot of counter space!,"This little crock saves a lot of counter space, as compared to the water dispenser that it replaced. It's also great looking!I gave it 4 stars because the white crock is really a shade of light gray, but that worked out fine for me since I have some gray in my kitchen.The cons: The stand costs as much as the crock, and although it is sturdy, it really isn't justified. Also, the customer service at this company is not good. I tried to change the color to black before it shipped and got absolutely no response. In this economy, they need to step up their game."
1,"Looks nice but too big, nothing like photo","The photo doesn't depict the actual item. ??? Weird. It's larger, wider, more squat in shape. Didn't fit in my kitchen in the small spot I had on my countertop, so now I'm paying for shipping both ways. Bummer."
4,"Great product, and well worth the money.","I purchased one of these last year and could not have been happier. It's very sturdy, easy to assemble, and very water tight. Just be careful about installing the rubber gasket to be sure that it is, in fact, on straight or you will develop a slow leak. This is easy enough to check for by running water into the crock and checking the outside for any visible drips. And of course, you obviously need to wash the inside thoroughly with soap and water prior to use in order to remove any dust from shipping as well as the odor of the styrofoam packing material.All in all, this was a great buy, and I highly recommend it. I myself loved everything about it up to the day my father in law dropped and shattered it, hence the reason I'm buying another today."
2,plastic spigot,"Almost bought this one at Whole Foods, but put it back on the shelf when I realized it had a plastic spigot. I don't understand the point of going through the trouble of having an expensive glass bottle, and ceramic dispenser to keep plastic away from my drinking water only to have a plastic spigot sitting IN the water 24-7. Wondering if there are other options, because I'm not looking forward to pouring water from my 3 gallon glass bottle of spring water."
3,No cover on a water dispenser.,A bit ridiculous to have a water dispenser without a lid! There is nothing in the listing to indicate that the bottle has no lid.
4,A LOT better that I expected!,"This is a surprisingly useful book. It is a quick read (about an hour or two); the basic format is a question, answer, and illustrative anecdote. I was pleased with the stories presented in the book and picked up a number of pointers. While the book starts out a bit on the obvious side (Q: When should you call a meeting? A: When a meeting is the best way to achieve your objective.), it moves into some though provoking issues such as dealing with interruptions, staggering attendance for optimum use of peoples' time, how to deal with those who want to go into depth on everything, etc. While some of the material on audio/visual material is amusingly out of date, the principles behind them are sound. The corporate world would be better off if everyone read and applied the principles found in this book."
4,Really different versions of all of the songs.,"Supposedly a 'live' CD, although coming from this band, I'm not quite sure what that means. The versions of Cimmerian (am i wrong) and Eye For the Main Chance(bring me down) are worth the cost of the cd alone. The music on this cd is just so masterfully done that I can't describe it. There are some really weird drum effects, especially on Cimmerian. Other good songs are Adrenaline( a hidden track), Subterfuge, If Only and Sometimes, and Chapter and Verse. I contemplated giving this disc 3 stars because I usually only listen to the first 2 tracks."
3,Good but poorly written,"The information contained in this book is better than many of the WarbirdTECH series, and it is a valuable reference on the Spitfire.However, it is very poorly written. The author never uses one word where three or more can be crammed in--and sometimes uses the wrong word (a severe case of Thesaurusitis). The grammar is often poor, and occasionally terrible. These faults make the book a very difficult read, and they are not merely due to the differences between British and American usage and style. That the editor chose not to work with the author to correct these problems is unfortunate, as the book could probably contain twenty-five percent more information if the editor had done so.If you need a succinct guide to the Spitfire, this book will do--but you will find the reading like wading through a swamp: one stumble, trip, and slip after another. [...]"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I started off with a pair of the 9007's for my headlights.. they're great - they lasted about 6 months before one blew out, but i recently got a set of the 881's for my foglights, and i'm disappointed to say they look no different than the stock bulbs. extremely disappointed in this product. don't waste your money on these."
3,Not great,"Mine arrived DOA. Action of the potentiometer seemed fine and smooth. Biggest downside is the power sucking wall wart it comes with. I bought a basic athearn unit at nearly half the cost, and I am much happier. No wall wart, and a power switch to turn it completely off. Cant really recommend this unit. Thanks to Amazon for the easy return."
1,Junk,"I purchased 3 power packs and within one week 2 became defective. Don't be fooled by Bachmann's return policy. You will be forced to wait weeks for a replacement. The units I purchased quickly became hot, plus were only operational in one direction. Also note the the controllers DO NOT have the ""UL"" seal. Should anyone be surprised? There are far better choices which are lower in price. Bachmann power is junk. Give to someone you strongly dislike."
1,defective,Arrived promptly but did not work. This is the second Bachmann Power Pack that did not work for me. I'm done with them
2,Better books out there - too many errors,"There are many technical errors and typos in the book. The author doesn't mention checking your HTML for syntax problems with an HTML checker/validator, a very important thing to do when learning HTML and when creating web sites. If the HTML in the book was checked, the book would have had fewer problems. However, there are some otherwise good tips and information in the book."
2,A waste of time...,"I bought this book in order to practice for the ACT, since I found no other books whatsoever that offer that many whole tests. The problem is that the level of the tests in McGraw-Hill's is way below the level of the real ACT. I also practiced using Barron's ACT book and Kaplan's ACT computer program, both had very challenging practice tests, some even harder than the real ACT. If you are abundant in time and want to practice more, get the book, because in any case it's more practice. Otherwise, it's just a waste of time and money; the questions are way too easy than the real thing, and it might misguide you."
1,WORST BOOK!!! IT WILL MISLEAD YOU!!!!,"Please do not waste your time with this book. I am a senior who is going through some stressful times with appying to colleges, however my ACT score isn't really up to par. I bought this book wanting more practice. After purchasing it and doing as many as five whole ACT practices tests from it, I developed a sense of confidence. I thought the real ACT would be a cinch, however it's nothing like the level of difficulty as the ones in this book. Please do not buy it. I've wasted enough time with it. It has gotten too many errors with the answer key, questions, etc. Buy Kapaln's or other books from the other companies. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!! PLEASE!!!"
3,A Great Guitarist - A Mediocre Instructor,"Preston Reed is an amazing acoustic guitarist. Just watching him play his pieces in this video is worth the price of the video, and it's a good thing because the instructional aspect is somewhat lacking. Reed obviously isn't comfortable in front of a camera. Watching him try to explain what he was doing was sometimes quite an ordeal. I'm not knocking the guy. Some people can teach and some can't. It reminds me of when I was studying computer science. Some of these instructors are absolute geniuses at programming and systems analysis, but put them in front of a classroom and they stink. The same is true with musicians, I suppose. Between the tablature and the slowed down versions of his playing different parts of the various pieces you can almost grasp what is going on. If you're really into Preston Reed you'll probably enjoy this video. If you're just trying to learn another approach to acoustic guitar you might want to shop around."
5,A Best Seller For The Past Eleven Years,"The techniques in this dvd are the same ones we teach to our clients. Why? Because they work. And fast. For some dogs, they work instantly. For others, it may take a couple of days, but I've yet to see a technique for housebreaking a dog or puppy that works faster."
4,A fictional story of real life,"A delightful tale of a girl from the backwoods sent by her avaricious father to spend the winter with stangers painting tinware in the early Eighteen Hundreds. There Amantha encounters a new world filled with things she didn't know wanted, and people neither so simple, trusting nor trustworthy as those she had known previously. She encounters romance and learns that honor and respect are of greater value than the excitement of being desired. She also learns that you can't go back to the way things were. It may not be a true story, but the heart recognizes it as a very real story. Winter on Her Own is not all sweetness and light; disappointments and tragedy balance the pleasures and joy, but ultimately, happiness wins out."
4,More from the Blanton-Webster band,"A valuable supplement to the well known RCA/BMG sets of Ellington's recordings from the early 40s. Of the 29 tracks, the first 19 have Blanton on bass, and there is plenty of Ben Webster. All the tracks were recorded in 1941, which many regard as Ellington's best year. Only 4 tracks are actual Ellington songs. The rest are tunes by Strayhorn, Mercer Ellington, and miscellaneous composers. For this reason, the set from RCA should be bought before this one. Among the tracks are the first recordings of A Train and Perdido. The sound quality is mostly good for the period. The source material is disks intended for use by radio stations."
4,kids like it,"A great way to learn how to play marbles - good for indoor play. Only minor complaint is that the mat will bubble up, not permitting a clean playing surface. It doesn't bother the kids though. They take it as a challenge of the game."
5,Fantastic Read,"I read Lost when it first came out. I reread it again and again over the years and enjoy it just as much each time. The story is fantastic, and you find yourself holding your breath so much. The charecters are so real, even The Chinamen, the dog Sherman the crazy older brother hooks up with. I cried over him, the writing is so vivid. His descriptions of the surrounding enviornment is also very vivid. You can see everyting, within the charecters and around them. Don't want to give anything away. The other reviews here say much more. It's a fantastic book."
4,Send Out Your Spirit,"Though it contains material for a different type of Christianity than mine, it has good background material, which is what interested me. It is well written"
4,light romance for female teens,"I bought this book when I was 10 (our school had a book fair). I didn't really enjoy it at first, simply because I was too young. I read it again at 13 and adored it. I could totatlly relate to Emily and Angel. The book deals with friendships, romance, school spirit, and discovering your identity. Even though it is old, it is still relavant. I still have my 17 year old copy and I read it every few years, because it brings back fond memories. I still occationally read other books I loved as a preteen/teen including ""Hail, Hail Camp Timberwood"", Gordon Korman books, ""Taking Care of Terrific"", Janette Oke's historical fiction, and the Elizabeth Gail series. IF you are a parent of a preteen girl, please buy atleast one of these books for your daughter. She will treasure them."
1,I cannot believe that this is on Amazon...,"I did not see this movie- I 'acted' as an extra in it, and was looking for a copy so that I could purchase it and watch to see if any of my scenes made the final cut. Hahaha!!! You know, after reading the other reviews, I'm buying it anyway just out of morbid curiosity and to see if Lyle's band made the final cut too..... -EK"
1,LURID AND SADISTIC,"AMERICAN NIGHTMARE is one of those movies you wonder how it ever got made. Despite an interesting premise, the film basically exists to show a sadistic killer nurse castrate and murder a local hunk; torture and kill the heroine's sister; and even have the heroine shoot her sister assuming it is the vile killer. Yuk. And the radio program itself guickly degenerates into a foul-mouthed, lewd, ridiculously scripted farce. The movie never explains why the killer nurse is on the rampage; why she hasn't been caught; and then the big finale where we're supposed to go ""Oooh...I never suspected that"" makes no sense because no back-up is provided for this stupid ending.Debbie Roshon, the ""star"" of this movie, plays the role so convincingly, it makes me wonder if she was acting at all.AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
2,american nightmare gets nowhere,"its begins great and then the finale sorta drops the whole experience. an intense and proably hurtful scene would be when the psycho chick slices into that guys, well you know his cucumber, owwww. otherwise it was good but the whole thing with them being at that cafe area lets it down too. it was an interesting view nontheless. not the worst in the lot I might add"
4,My Experiance with the movie,"Well i have not yet had a chance to see this movie but whan they were filming the movie i was on set in cleburne,TX were they filmed the old school scene any way i loved getting the chance to watch a movie in progress it was very well directed and and the actors were really good at acting but any way i love the plot and it was a great experiance to have been able to see the film"
2,no so great,"it would be a MUCH better reference if telesco had consistently put the religion associated with the goddesses. there is not much info about the goddess, and she occasionally forgets to give us even the most basic of background on the goddess of the day. she lists catholic saints as goddesses. she used the greek goddess callisto for a korean holiday. there are some goddess descriptions i have found to be... inaccurate (nice way to say it...) upon further research. all in all, kind of a waste of money."
4,Family Tool,"We use this in our nightly family groundings. We center and ground and then we read the next day's Goddess as well as a piece from another book. It is a lovely little book, but I wish some of the Goddess's hadn't been moved to an open date. That is what it seems like anyway... as if some of Them don't belong where They are."
4,Handy companion,"Keep this book nearby to look at each morning for a daily contemplation and small ritual to keep in touch with Nature and the many faces of the Goddess within yourself.Small, yet significant, and moving rituals for everyday life."
1,Pricing?,"As much as the books usually are for this subject, I'm not about to pay more than twice the price for a Kindle edition."
5,Monastic Spaces-Cistercian life in depth,"This book contains vital new reserch on the early cistercian understanding of its own spirituality and of the enclosed Abbey. This book is not forced and although the ideas are radical, vital and new, they are compleatly and professonaly reserched. As a PHD student on Cistercians I whole heartedly recommend this important piece of new reserch and indeed, deem it essential reading in this field. Revd. Paul Fitzpatrick"
5,best book ever,"this has got to be one of the best books i have ever read.-EVER WRITTEN ! I read it cover to cover twice. It will open your eyes to what certain interest groups and extreme librials will do to destroy everything thats Right in this country.We dont need them. Read this book then look around you , Divource, kids having kids, vulgarity everywhere. Tammy Bruce is right on. Cant wait for her next book!"
3,Good but not great,"Tammy Bruce's book is a good book, fast read and interesting but is both too shallow and weirdly printed to be great. I'll explain. FIrst the bold headers every five paragraphs or so are off putting, but allow her to change topics fast and make the book seem more stream of conscious.Also I agree with much of what she has to say and find her arguments plausible for the most part. Her tactic is to use specific instances and build from there. Sometimes, like with NOW and the Gay Alliances she builds to a unifying point. Other times (TV and media) she builds to many examples but not further.The book is worht reading, but it is not Bill Bennett."
1,this book sucked,what a waste of money I found it hard to read for any length of time. how can an author that writes like this get published. you would get more satifaction out of the coupon section in sunday paper than this rag
5,Moral relativity is killing America,Bruce makes a very lucid and strong argument that the Elite Left are mentally unstable and need of mental health professionals. Her case is very tight in regards to the Elite Left wanting to degrade the American psyche and strength. A must read for parents. This book woke me up to what my children are going to face and what I can do about it.
5,It's mind-blowing!,"I read a lot of books but this book, ""The Death of Right and Wrong,"" really blew my mind. It opened my eyes to things that I haven't even thought of and it brought me to the realization that our values and culture were being ""toiled"" with. I have learnt quite a lot from this book and I encourage the author, Tammy Bruce, to continue writing books like this one. Keep it up Tammy!"
2,Doesn't Prove Much,"The point of a book like this is to challenge the common thoughts on certain issues-- tease the brain with thoughts that are seen as 'politically incorrect'. This book does neither. Bruce only offers the same stereotypical arguements for controversial views that we've heard millions of times before. And even when she does have an acutely original thought, it fails to prove to the reader that she is right.It's an unflinching look at today's most diluted political and social issues, and for that Bruce receives a few stars. But beyond that, I would not recommend this book.(I am not completely through this rather long book- about 3/4, but seeing as it sells so well, I thought I should forewarn people.)"
4,almost there,"A good overview of the decay and nihilism of so much of contemporary culture. The author contributes much of it to the damaged narcisistic personalities of the cultural elites. She neglects however the intellectual foundations of those personalities and their grounding in marxism. She doesn't seem to consider the idea that much of the attack on contemporary culture is political in nature and deliberate in its intentions, and seeks a specific goal.I found it good, though, to find that some of my own observations about our cultural climate aren't entirely off base--- somebody actually wrote a book about it."
2,Not really simplified,"I got this so I could get new ideas for teaching the basics of DOE to others. Though I don't have any trouble understanding the text, it didn't do what I had hoped. I'm sure it's simpler than really statistics intensive texts, but really simple, it just isn't."
3,A Reasonable Quick Survey,"DOE Simplified is perhaps overly simplified. The author tries to pack ANOVA, factorial experimentation, use of blocking and fold overs, and response-surface methodology inside 200 pages. The attempt is admirable, but the book would be hard for a beginner to fully understand due to information gaps, especially on why the techniques work (at least on an intuitive level). The person who would benefit most is that person needing a refresher after a being away from DOE for some time."
5,Very straightforward,Great book. Steps through basic stats in anticipation of use for DOEs. Good examples and well-written. Easy to recommend.
4,Not so simplified,This is still pretty tough material to process if you do not have a strong satistics background. This book proves that DOE is for the engineers.
3,Made Me A Bit Crabby,"Windows on a Lost World is one of the more technical Star Trek novels. My background lies more with the humanities, so I felt the story dragged a bit, but even though I wasn't particularly interested in the anthropology, geology, and oceanography related issues that were dealt with, I recognized that it was well thought out and written.A Trekker who is interested in such subjects will this a worthwhile read."
1,Not Worth Reading,"Star Trek novels are certainly not works of creative genius or high literary quality, but they are generally fun to read. ""Windows on a Lost World,"" however, was not. Many of the beloved Star Trek characters, Dr. McCoy and Chekov in particular, behave in ways that run counter to their carefully developed personalities. The plot device of having main characters turn into crabs wears thin quickly. There are some fairly major holes in the plot as well.My wife and I have read many Star Trek novels over the years, and we both agreed that ""Windows on a Lost World"" is by far the worst."
1,Don't ever turn anyone into a crab -- EVER!,"I tried to read this book with an open mind, but really found it to be a hard read. I can't recommend this one at all. My suggestion? If you want to become totally immersed in an alien culture, read ""Uhura's Song"" by Janet Kagan."
1,Not up to par,"I normally love these books, especially the dry wit. This one was a bit dull and very disjointed. Why did Shinko have much more press than Claud? Lots of loose ends not tied up and just not as amusing. Caca de chiens is a bit harsh, but perhaps fitting."
4,"Enjoyable, enaging, eye-opening","I cannot vouch for the integrity or accuracy of the scholarship that butresses Helms' arguments. This book is my first foray into the critical scholarship of the New Testament, after having whetted my appetite on Old Testament texts such asAncient Israel: From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple (Revised & Expanded)andThe Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts.I enjoyed Helms' style of writing and found many of his arguments persuasive. Above all, it was very satisfying and liberating to throw off the shackles of fear and begin to approach the New Testament, and the historical Jesus of Nazareth, from a critical standpoint. Helms may not offer the definitive treatment here, but this volume is very accessible and informative. You will certainly know much more than the majority of fellow attendees during your next Sunday School class."
2,Book intro's idea of even and odd numbers,"We loved Murphy's ""Henry the Fourth"", but we didn't particularly like this book. While the artwork is delightful, the rhymes are clumsy, and worse, the premise just is not very interesting. At least, finding out what happened to the cow's utter-mittens did not engage my kids (almost 3 and 5).On the plus side, the book did give my almost 5 y.o. and myself a place to start talking about even and odd. And the way that the artist showed the pairs of mittens and the missing mitten in outline made it easy to point out what the story was taking about.But I'd give this book a pass unless you are desparate to find an edutainment introduction to even/odd numbers."
5,Great Introduction to Odds and Evens,"My five-year-old son loves this entire series and thoroughly enjoyed Missing Mittens. As did I, for that matter. We are living in a warm climate, so my son was immediately drawn to the snowy setting. He enjoyed the story and definitely grasped the odds and evens concept as we were reading through the book. I read a lot of books aloud to my son--both fiction and nonfiction and ranging from picture books to chapter books such as Tales of My Father's Dragon. While some reviewers seemed to find this story lacking, my son and I both enjoyed it. I have a huge math and numbers fan in my son and I love how this book provides him with an introduction to so many concepts that interest him. I used to teach and definitely think this would be great in the classroom as well. This is a great series!"
5,http://www.successblueprint.biz/?id=maximus099,"I'm in relationship marketing and this was one of the most refreshing, informative, realistic books on the subject I've read so-far this year and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is already in or plan to get into relationship marketing."
2,"A few interesting ideas, but caveat emptor","I worked as an internal consultant in a large US federal agency where Booz Allen & Hamilton used this book as the ""Bible"" for their restructuring effort. While some of the ideas have merit, the book is overly prescriptive without enough regard for the nature of the underlying organization and its environment. Woe to the government executive who thinks he or she can manage a ""centerless"" agency, with its scary implications for accountability to Congress, the head of the agency, and citizens. Perhaps this review is more a reflection on how the book was used by BAH, but the lack of caution I saw in its application leads me to advise readers to be careful about applying its guidance. I would hazard a guess that similar dangers confront private sector consumers of this book's prescriptions."
1,Nothing but Fluff,"This book was written solely as a money-maker, rather than a real information and strategy provider. As a consultant, I bought this book to provide background on corporate organizational issues. Much to my dismay, the book offered me nothing--and I mean NOTHING! The book is simply a recap of what any consultant should already know about corporate strategies, business models and organizational development. I believe that these writers began to think that they were in the wrong business, and therefore, tried to earn a little extra money by putting down what they already knew rather than researching, analyzing and providing something that is truly innovative and transforming. A good read if you want to know the basics and are new to business, otherwise, a waste of time!"
4,"Extremely good, but a little repetitive","I enjoy reading ""The Centerless Corporation"" more than almost any other business book. It provided me with a lot of good applicable ideas based on a visionary perception of the corporate organizations for the next century."
1,Mistakes Were Made,"Mills makes some elementary algebraic and computational mistakes in the first chapter, chooses an unphysical ""boundary condition,"" and it's all downhill from there.He also manages to derive anti-gravity from his theory. Since an anti-gravity shield is identically the same as a perpetual motion machine, it's clear he has made some errors.The book is tough reading, dense, and frequently damnably obtuse. The last chapters read as if they were extracted from patent applications."
3,A valuable introduction to the now available DNA activation.,"If you can overlook the organization of the book, you can find the seeds that will change your health, and your life, and in a matter of weeks, not years. I have had, and strongly recommend the option of receiving both activations, the reading and the healing(s) by telephone! An unforgettable experience. Call the phone number in the back of the book to get the name & number of a facilitator nearest to you, then call for an appointment to get started. Often a book can be valuable for the leads it provides to other books, and this one lead me to Vianna Stibal's book, ""Go Up and Seek God"", available at vianna@srv.net. Anyone with a serious health problem will benefit from reading Vianna's book."
1,Didn't work.,"I bought and read this book with great hope - I believe in magic, I believe in energy work, I believe in miracles. I dearly want to activate all my DNA strands. After the first exercise I left it a couple of weeks to see if there were any changes. There were none. I did not continue."
1,Read the original,This is the work of the ex-partner of Vianna Stibal. Gerard's version is heresay. He offers no scientific validity. He offers no explanation for using Vianna's ideas (which he drastically over complicates). The work is not sound and is NOT approved by the FDA or any other healing organization. Do not be deceived by thie promises.
2,not convincing,"Tara Revisited is an only marginally convincing portrait of the ""real"" southern woman. Clinton successfully debunks the myth of the Old South, yet fails to put in its place a convincing and thorough discussion of the real lives of these women.Clinton, in refuting the popular myth of the ""southern belle,"" does put up her own model for the southern lady. But this model depends little on how these women actually lived and what they really though; rather she consistently insists on painting women in an overly noble and (still) idealized way.If you are looking for a good history and examination of women during the American Civil War, try ""Mothers of Invention"" by Drew Gilpin Faust. It is immensely more satisfying than Clinton's depiction."
1,A Connecticut Yankee's views on Southern Life,"I picked up this book and a bookstore in Georgia, thinking it to be a historical book about the South. I was apalled by her insensitivity to the Southern plantation owner. Though there were cruel plantation owners, there were also the genuinly kind people, who cared for the slaves. My ancestors owned slaves, but the majority of them stayed with our family after the war. I wish that the author would pay more attention to the what the southerners had to go through after the war, with homes burned, and families starved, instead of calling it all ""southern myth"" which has be made into movies and books and over publicized with Scarlett O'Hara and Mammy to stir the hearts of America's people. For the ""southern myth"" is no myth at all; it is the true story of thousands of Americans who fought for what they believed in their hearts as right, the protection of their values and way of life."
1,"Disappointing, one sided, laced with Author's own prejudice","As a lover and avid reader of history I was VERY disappointed in this book. I found Ms. Clintons opinions and interpretations of the south and southern plantation era one sided, selective, and laced with her own prejudices. Yes, it was a horrible, horrible time for the blacks, whites and our country. Slavery will always be Americas greatest shame, a flaw that most of us struggle to understand and rectify in our human frailty each day, but if Ms. Clinton is to be believed, there was but a handful of humane, caring ""white"" people residing in the south during this time! Which is Not true! If Ms. Clinton considers herself a true historian (which I do not) and writer of history I feel it is her duty to tell All sides honestly, with equal amounts of pros and cons, and without her own bias slants. To my fellow history buffs I can not reccoment this book and I can honestly say that I will never read another of Ms. Clintons books in the future."
1,Boney is no longer Boney,"If you love Boney's older stuff - the smooth jazz that put him on the map to begin with - do NOT buy this CD. It's an R&B CD first of all that breaks the mood you probably are trying to set. It is clear that Boney is abandoning the fans who appreciated him for his wonderful smooth jazz-sax talent. Instead, he appears to want to drop back to being a background instrumentalist for many no-name but perhaps up and coming R&B singers. That's noble I guess, but it's something I'm not interested in. For those mourning the loss of true Boney James music, try Marion Meadows instead, you'll love him."
3,Not a bad album but...,if you happened to buy the six albums before this you gonna be a little disappointed.If you want him at his finest pick up Body Language and Sweet Thing.
4,Boney's finest work yet,"Boney does it again with his first Concord release ""Shine"". Not only does it feature Boney's sensuous sax playing, but it does offer a bevy of guest artists such as George Duke, George Benson, even Ann Nesby (the grandma of American Idol finalist Paris Bennett). He sounds best on the tune ""The Total Experience"", which is heard on smooth jazz stations nationwide. I would certainly recommend this CD. Now if Boney would release a standards album a la Chris Botti, Maybe he can get Renee Olstead as a guest artist, or even Michael Buble."
5,Wow! Boney has done it again.,"I love this CD. He pairs up with various other artists in a little different sytle but it works. Having Boney and George Benson on the same track, is amazing and HYPNOTIC is my favorite cut. Absolutely a must for any smooth jazz listener."
1,A SNOOZEFEST,"Someone please put all these Smooth Jazz clones out of their collective misery. Sooooo tired. Maybe Boney James should bring in Hilary Duff for some ""groundbreaking"" duets on his next overproduced effort. Zzzzzzz...."
5,Metaphysical inspiration,"There are two very great selections in this CD: The first bears the title of the CD called ""Shine"": Its bold, hard hitting, yet enticing sounds and rhythms are an inspiration to the soul.The second song called ""let it go"" is equally as enchanting. The title alone is a good philosophy regarding those things in our lives that are best left alone. We need to move on from the negative. Anytime I find myself with something which will take up too much of my time and cause too much pain, I think back to this song.All in all, its a good CD: Not every song on it in fact is that good, but the two I just mentioned are soo good, that they compensate for all the rest."
3,It's Alright,"Taylor Dayne had some Promise I did like the song ""I'll Alway Love You""&""Tell it to my heart"" was alright for the time period but overall I wasn't crazy about the rest of Her Musical direction.this is all you will ever need on Her."
1,Poorly written plot,"I have read several of Lisa Gardner's books and was caught up the in plots, barely able to put the books down. This one is so boring and tedious I could not wait to finish it. I found myself skipping over whole paragraphs to avoid the tedious and insipid romances, as well as the boring story line. This is one to avoid."
3,fast paced but a little juvenile,"One of my pet peeves is having an uncommon phrase used by many different characters. It's sloppy writing. If she said. ""in the good news department/in the bad news department"" one more time, I would have screamed!"
3,Stunning Conclusion,"An ingenious killer is on the move again. It's been three years since he's struck. He waits for a heat wave to hit, then kidnaps two girls. He kills one and leaves her body to be found with clues on it leading to the other girl who is still alive. The first half of this book has a few slow paced sections, but the well-drawn and appealing characters hold it together. The second half is a race to a conclusion that is a stunner. Even the acknowledgements at the beginning of the book are entertaining. This is the first book by this author that I have read and it has sparked my interest in her other novels. A very good read."
1,Another author who can't check facts.,"Well, well, another outsider who once again reveals their ignorance of the Appalachian/Cumberland Plateau region. The protagonists drive from Richmond, VA to Lee County, VA in an hour? Maybe in some Bizarro Virginia where Toyota Camrys travel via shortcuts that defy time and space. Employ a fact checker, Gardner, instead of relying on your volunteer ""experts""."
2,If you compare it with its prequels...,"The main story of the book is excellent. The problem is if you can find it before getting bored and fling the book away. If you compare this book with its prequels 'The Third Victim' and 'The Next Accident' you won't read even half book. Now, you have to have in mind that you don't need to read the prequels to understand this book. But you have to do it to understand why I only gave two stars to this story. As every human being, the writers have ups and downs and I think here LG was very down.Query:How is possible that a person drinks super-contaminated water and survive?"
2,Very repetitive,"The whole ""good news department"" phrase was used way too much. IMO this wasn't one of Gardner's best. I was hoping the story would pick up, but it lacked the emotion and suspense as Gardner's previous works. I could barely finish the book and the ending couldn't come fast enough. The time and temperature updates were so annoying.. we get it! It's hot outside. Gardner is one of my favorite authors and it felt like she was just going through the motions when she wrote this one."
5,The Killing Hour review,"Excellent read! Could not put the book down. Typical Lisa Gardner. Very Suspendful book, full of twists. Definitely a must!"
2,"Intense and interesting suspense, if weak character/relationship development and romance","The relationship between Pierce and Quincy is just messed up and disappointing, and Kimberly is rather annoying and pompous at the beginning. The relationship between Kimberly and Mac is much more fulfilling, although I still would have liked to see some more depth and growth there. The suspense, however, was pretty intense and interesting and kept me wrapped in the story, even if the romances were rather weak. I also hated all the power-plays between the FBI, Marines, etc. which just detracted from the story and were without purpose, and the killer became pretty obvious near the end. For the most part, an interesting and intense read *without the graphic sex scenes, which was nice*, but still not compelling and satisfying enough to purchase, only to borrow."
5,A gripping and descriptive page turner...,"This book scared the daylights out of me. Lisa Gardner's descriptive writing techniques do a great job of putting you in the victims shoes. I could actually imagine what it would be like to be in this victim's situation. The chemistry between Mac and Kimberly, as well as the return of Rainie and Quincy made this book is a definate plus, but to me, what made the book so intense and gripping was the fact that we were kept informed regarding what was going on with the victim's. Very scary stuff!This novel is definately a page turner, and you realize that as soon as you read the first page. I definately recommend this book to anyone who loves a good suspense thriller."
2,Boring detail,"The only thing that prevented my stopping at about page 70 was the story line. I wanted to find out how it ends. But it was hard slogging having to read every detail of what biologists, geologists and -ologists one has never heard of have to say about their fields. I think the author is much too proud of the fact that she does research and wants the reader to be impressed."
2,Lisa G,"normally I like Lisa gardner and that is why I purchased this book. But this one was slow, slow, slow. I had to leave it several times and read another book. I am still trying to get thru it."
2,In the bad news department,What's up with the good / bad news department phrase used by every character on every single page? Isn't there a better way?
1,Impossible to Assemble!,"This shelf has to be one of the WORST shelves I have ever attempted to put together. I should mention that I am extremely happy that I only opened 1 box, so returning the remaining units should be a breeze!The metal is warped and doesn't fit at all. Many of the holes that the screws must pass through are misaligned, and even after forcing them in, you still can't attach the nut due to the metal edges touching the screw itself. The only way this shelf will be rigid enough to hold all of the weight it's weighted for is to tighten all of the screws... which you can't.DO NOT BUY!"
2,Zapper,"The bug zapper lasted a little over a year, First one of the bulbs stopped coming on. I replaced it and it would still not light up. So ran it with one, then the second bulb stopped and the electrical grid stopped powering up. It did last longer then all the ones I went through from homedeepot."
4,art lesson,"the reality of politics and perceptions in law enforcement. sumptuous columbo-like setting of the nyc art world. suspects killed off along the way eliminating the need for the courtroom. conventional cliff-hanger ending.still,above average."
2,No exciting buildup to get to the predictable end.,The every day happenings in the lives of the main characters were boring and predictable. I never felt their true personalities were made known to the reader. Key events were not reached through exciting or mysterious build-up so were greeted with neither surprise nor inspiration.
3,Did not hold my interest,An okay book--content and writer's style did not hold my interest but was an easy read.
2,Edward George Bulwer-Lytton would be ever so proud!,"If you enjoyed Paul Clifford, you'll love this. Here's the first sentence for you: ""It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents--except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness."" Linda Fairstein has taken the master's style and run with it.Not in my recent reading have I seen a book so in need of slash and burn editing. It is said that smarter people write longer sentences, but this book bludgeons you with excess words on every page."
1,BORING and arrogant IN THE EXTREME,"If you like reading about the wealthy, the painted arts and restaurants this books for you. It's more of a dinningout in NY guide and what and where the filthy rich do and go. Everyone of the main characters is amultimillionaire, old money, new money, luxurious Fifth Ave. apartments, tropical island homes, MVineyardsummer homes blahblahblah. Art is the backdrop. We're talking Rembrandt, Cezanne, Vincent van Gogh, EdgarDegas, Picasso here.The third wife of one of the oldest and biggest art dealers is found snagged on the shores of the Hudson River,dead, strapped to a ladder with a cracked skull.I found it very slow, boring and arrogant. Not to mention unreal.I personally don't give a hoot about the wealthy."
2,Very poor audio book,"I listened to Cold Hit from the abridged commercial audiobook, so I won't comment on the writing style, as what I heard may not be representative of the original written prose. I strongly suggest, though, that if you want to learn this story you read the book rather than listening to the tape. Without a doubt, this is the most poorly produced/edited commercial audio book I've listened to. The reader is bad enough, starting out on the first tape at such a rapid pace that I repeatedly had to rewind and replay portions to make out what she had said. The editing makes things even worse. Throughout the story there is background noise discernable, very noticeable session breaks, and there are multiple instances when the reader flubbed a sentence, stopped, and started reading again back at the beginning of the sentence, and the entire error is left on the tape with no effort made to edit it out."
2,Didn't like it.,"Didn't like this too much. A lot of the book was filler -- conversations that weren't really related to the plot at all, or interesting in and of themselves, but clearly intended to fill up space so she could turn the book in to her publisher. I had a hard time finishing it because what action there was in the book ended about halfway through. These are things that her editor should have made her correct because they are very obvious. So to that extent I blame the editor.Also, I found the author's description on the dust cover as ""America's foremost prosecutor of crimes of sexual assault and domestic violence"" to be objectionable -- she runs the sexual assault bureau for a single city, which should be credentials enough. Mr. Fairstein, sometimes you are allowed to tell the publicity department, 'No.' This excessive tooting of your own horn makes you look bad.I don't think I will buy this author's books again in hardcover."
3,"Good, not great.","An interesting story, well-told. Still, it's nowhere near the best Star Trek story I've read, even if the characters are all handled well and the plot and writing smooth and professional. Worth reading, but not worth raving about. A little too good for a three-star review, but definitely not a four-star."
4,THE FALL OF TEROK NOR ... the rise of a great Trek saga,"Told with, perhaps, not as much depth as some of the other tales by Judith & Garfield Reeves-Stevens, THE FALL OF TEROK NOR starts out very, very slowly but does deliver with an unbelievably-exciting climax to set up the second book (already on the shelves in the states).Arguably, this writing team go to great lengths to preserve the characters that make up the Trek universe, and THE FALL OF TEROK NOR is no example otherwise. All of your favorites from DS9 -- including an even impromptu but somewhat shoddily written cameo by Vic Fontaine -- appear in your mind's eye as they would on the small screen.The story? There isn't much that could be disclosed without ruining it for those who want to take a good Trek: suffice it to say that THE FALL OF TEROK NOR deals with the end of all life as we know it!Excellent reading."
4,A Very Good Start,"This is the first time I've tried a DS9 novel, mainly because the writers assigned to this series have been the lesser lights of the Trek Books. But The Reeves-Stevenses wrote two of my favorite Trek books, Federation and Prime Directive, and I knew they would not let me down.They didn't. The intricacies of the plot are sparkling and some of the character play, especially involving Quark, echoes the TV show perfectly. Not everything is perfect -Dr. Bashir and Worf are a bit flat, and O'Brien's usual blandness gets in the way - but this is a very ggod, exciting and surprisingly quick read. A treat for Trekkies like myself who miss DS9 or for those who read the Shatner books because they were the real writers."
4,S.D.T. M. Review,I think SING DOWN THE MOON is a very good book. I think the best part is the end where Tall Boy and Bright Morning reach their canyon again. This book really did deserve the Hans Christian Anderson Medal!
4,Sing Down the Moon,"This is a lyrical and heartbreaking children's novel, treating The Long Walk of the Navajo people between 1863 and 1865. An excellent teaching tool."
3,The kids review,Bright Morning and Running Bird (her friend) go up to the mesa to graze their sheep a Spaniard comes and snatches them and takes them back to their village Bright Morning and Running Bird make it back to the canyon safely but the long Knives are a threat now and they make a threat to chase them out of the canyon will they make it back read the book to find out. I liked the book because it was adventurous and Bright Morning is always trying to get away.
4,Review of Sing Down,"Sing down the moon is a book for ages about 11-13.The main character is a girl named Bright morning, and she's a Navajo Indian. She gets kid-napped by the Spaniards.When she gets back, she has this ceremony of becoming a woman.After her tribe has a march, in the march they walked a lot and a lot of people got sick and died. Some people had hope and some people thought it was going to be the end.During the march Bright Morning and Tall Boy got married.It's a historical fiction story, and if you like historical fiction... I suggest you read it.There were parts in the book which I think were not so good and I didn't really like it, but there were parts that were fine and pretty interesting."
3,Navajo life,This is an okay book. I find their naming system based on things in the environment to be strange. It is sad when a group of people is forced into slavery. The story takes place during the 1860s.
5,"very touching, inspiring and disturbing",This book excellently describes the hard working life of the Navaho Indians that was stripped from them by Long Knives and forced their entire nation to walk 300 miles into slavery. This book tells the disturbing story of how the Native Americans were treated by the US Government.
2,Could be worse,"I found this book to be very boring. I've read worse, but not many. Scott O'Dell has wrote many really good books, but this is not one of them. It is really hard to be interested in Sing Down the Moon. There really isn't that much action and the plot is dull. I wouldn't recomend this to anybody, unless you are totally bored or you have to read it. That is just my opinion. Read it if you wish."
2,"Sing Down the Moon, a shock?",This I thought was a very dull book. Scott o'dell could of done a much better job of writing this book. His other book The black Pearl was an outstanding book. The thing that realy shocks me is that it is an awarded book. All the awarded books I have read are very good and educational.
1,Sing Down the moon,"I think that this book is horrible! It is lacking so much character description! For instance, when Bright Morning gets captured by the Spaniards, she shows no emotion at all! She isn't even sad! Scot O'Dell's other books, like Island of the blue dolphins, are much better."
4,Some of the truth about the long walk.,"When I read this book I thought that the book was interesting and at the sametime a little sad. I thought it was sad because my ancestors were the one that had to suffer the hard times through the Long walk. The Soldiers were the one that had no repect for the Navajos. They were the one that would shoot any one that would stop, just because an eldery person had to stop to take a break or a Navajo lady was about to have a baby.I think if some of the Soldiers ever regret what they did to the Navajo's. Even thought they may have just rode the horses along side of the Navajo's that were walking for more then 300 miles. To different places and showing them to they people at Santa Fe. Kit Carson was a mean and hateful guy to the Navajo'sthat is all i have to say about the Long Walk.I hope that it never happen agian, and that the Navajo's fought for us to keep this wonderful and beautful place full of adventure."
2,Sing Down the Moon literature group review,"We would give this book a two star because it had some exciting parts but too much description on the not as important parts, which made it a little boring.This book tells us about a 14 year-old navaho girl. Her name is Bright Morning. She and her friend Running Bird are captured. They meet a slave named Nehana, who helps them run away. Their whole tribe is taken into captivity by the Long Knives. Then she marries Tall Boy ( a former warrior). They run away, have a child, and live happly ever after.In conclusion we do not reccomend this book to anyone who likes excitment."
3,Interesting,"Aside from the technical problems it is a pretty good book. I have to admit this is not one of Scott O'Dell's finest work. I recommend it for a casual reading, but not for anything you have to read. Over all I liked it, but it could have been more accurate."
3,Not That Bad,In the begining of the book I was so bored. But u need to understand it a bit and u need to have patientce to do so.
2,Wondering about authenticity,"I am from the four corners area and am wondering about how much research Scott C'Dell did for this book? I have never heard of mesquite growing around here or aspen in Canyon de Chelly or of the pueblo people eating dog meat and...... the owl a GOOD OMEN? I don't think so!!!! Any one from this area that has any knowledge of the Navajo culture knows that OWLS ARE NOT GOOD OMENS!!! I am reading this book with my class and am so frustrated by the fact that such a good author would be so negligent. The other students don't seem to notice the problems that I have with the book, except of course the Navajo students. I was happy to see the reviews from children who agree with what I was thinking. I am an adult student."
3,"Some Excitement, Mostly Boring","I thought the book was OK the first time I read it. The second time though, it made sense to me that the book rambled on, and the only part worth reading was the action part that was only about 3-4 pages. I wouldnt reccommend thsi book unless you like very, very indetail details that go on and on and on...."
2,Loosely tied together plot,"I read this book in about 1 hour and found that it was just a series of events loosely tied together in attempt to form a decent story.Don't get me wrong Scott o'Dell worked marvels in Island of the Blue Dolphins,but he seriously failed with this one.If you love Scott O' Dell books and have a hour or two just to kill,check it out,if not leave this book on the shelf."
4,a cruel world,"this is the story of Bright Morning an Indian who is stolen away by Spanish men and forced into slavery. She manages to escape and return to her village, but more soldiers come and tell all her people to leave. The soldiers force them to march many miles to a strange land. During this long walk many Indains died, and even if they didnt thier will to live was killed. The soldiers treated the Indians like they were animals. The most horrible part of this story is it was true. Mans inhumanity to man"
3,Sing down the moon,"In some parts of Sing Down The Moon it was good and in others it was boring. It is about a girl named Bright Morning and Running Bird. They go to flock their sheep and then long knives come and captured them.Then this girl named Rosita who helped the slave owner.And stumbled Apon the truth. You can go to the last page of the book to find out what happens in the story. But I would read the book, you might actually like it."
4,The amazing book,"""Sing Down The Moon"" by ScottO'Dell is about a group of kids who always fight about when they want to go somewhere because some want to go one place and the other one will want to go some place else. All they did was fight, so one day they went home to their parents and ask them how to solve the problem. One day they had the same problem all over again so they figure out what to do so they decided to go one place that day and the other place the next day. That is how they solve their problem every time they had one. You should read this book because its good and you could learn how to solve your problems from this book.""Sing Down the Moon"" is a good book because they wrote it the author with dialogue and in the dialogue the parts are funny. It is an OK book because some parts of it seem like it missing and some parts seem like it does not make sense. It is a bad book because it is to long."
1,BORING,THIS IS THEE MOST BORING BOOK MY TEACHERS HAVE EVER MADE ME READ AND THEY MADE ME READ ALOT!!!I WOULD NOT RECOMEMD THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WITH AN IMAGINATIO
1,Unconvincing and boring,"What's her face is an unconvincing character and I would never think of reading this again. Choose something else! I'm warning you! (It won't kill you, but it can be mentally damaging!)"
3,Good photos but nothing else.,"This book is a conpilation of excellant color photographs taken inside and outside two Korean restaurants in Virginia. It is listed under Korean Cookery which means ""the art of Korean cooking"". I was told this was a childrens book, but I fail to see what possible interest a child aged 4 - 8 could have in pictures of a Korean restaurant. The book should be classified under Children's Picture books instead of Korean Cookery."
3,Good but a bit slow,"This is a rather slow pace course with emphasis on repeating sentences. Some good points include periodical tests to help check on your progress and good quality recordings of native speakers. Not so good points: too verbose on the English side in the recordings, too little grammer covered and no kana."
4,Decent product,game board is a bit small and hard to lay fly at first. Once you do the directions are a bit hard to understand. With a little help from the internet we understood the game better and now use the mat to play.
3,Good and Bad,"Every stamp is pictured (in B&W) and had a short history of the stamp, some just a sentence or two and some a paragraph or two. The informative part is very good.The stamp values were based on buying the stamp at retail from a dealer. It included what a dealer would charge for handling, therefore the minimum value for one stamp was 20 cents. About 80% of the stamps in the book were valued at 20 cents. For example, the H make-up stamp which you could buy new for a penny last year is listed with a value of 20 cents used!I have had people who want to buy my stamps but I have no idea if their offers are reasonable or not. I still don't know but I do know 20 cents each for even very common stamps would be a pipe dream."
3,Well ! !,"Well the first thing i wanna say is this is a good try by our mexican musicians of MIS the talent is there a bit hardsh but just like a diamond you gotta polish it to make it shine same here good luck guys hope to hear more from you, if you are looking for an album to just listen to when you are doing work around the house this is good don't pay more than 10 Dlls. for it Tho is not worth more than that or better yet just download the songs you like becuase there is only a few the are good the rest are just fillers."
4,kipper episodes are entertaining and fun to watch,"my 3 yr old loves the kipper episodes. we have been through a whole bunch of series and sets of favorite characters and kipper has held up to dora and barney and the einstein videos. the skits in each video/dvd are along the lines of things kids his age would think of and do, so he totally relates to these shows. this is another great one in the series that are out so far"
5,Authentic 50's traditional style rockabilly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Rockin' Llyod Tripp is just plain awesome, he plays slap bass, and sings in the 50's rockabilly ""Elvis"" style, only his voice is very unique and authenticly his own, yet he sounds like someone you'd have expected to have been a star in the 50's. The band strives to play music that is 50's rockabilly, but the songs are originals. Rock'nRoll Rich is an instant classic, and the entire cd, never gets dull and is always fun and innovative. Fun swingin' rock'a'billy!!! Top notch musicians who certianly don't lack in high energy. Great cd!!!"
2,"gee, that was uh....hmmmm","basically this is an ""ok"" record. Generic for the most part with weak vocals. The ""singer"" (who also plays bass) has no range and hiccups way too much (like every single song). Basic three chord stuff, great guitar playing - very much like cliff gallop (gene vincents blue caps). Prety good songs, nothing mind blowing but pretty solid. This band should take their own advice and ""ride that rocket""....back to the studio and try again...With a little more effort the next one could be a great record."
4,The legend of Jesse Owens,This is one of the best books I have ever read. What an incredible life Jesse had.
1,NOT AS REPRESENTED,WILL NEVER PURCHASE item this way again. Was provided product other than what was represented. Attempted to resolve and obtain what was described and pictured (see photo but DO NOT be misled as I was) but after several attempts gave up and WILL NOT buy from again.
4,This novel got its title from a line muttered by Gorkon.,"The Klingons and the Feds bury the hatchet and negotiate for peace. Unfortunately, the process is thwarted with an assassination of the Klingon Chancellor and a push for power by Chang.Some memorable characters are introduced: An eye- patched Klingon (Chang), a Klingon lady in a position of power, a shape-shifter (related to Odo?), another half-Romulan, half-human Spock protege, a new StarFleet Commanding Admiral, and Worf's ancestor.Has anyone noticed that Klingons have somehow run out of ""K"" names? Same thing with the Vulcans, who have depleted the number of ""S"" names for the guys and ""T"" names for the ladies."
4,A Solid Star Trek Novel,"Star Trek VI is one of my favorites of the movie series, so I was curious to see whether the novelization was as good. I was not disappointed. This is a quick and enjoyable read, with quite a bit of dialogue taken directly from the movie. Dillard has an excellent feel for the familiar characters and for the Star Trek world in general.I had only two complaints. There are some backstories, such as Carol Marcus's injury, which add nothing to the narrative and in fact bog it down somewhat. And for some of the movie's best and funniest lines, Dillard includes the characters' thoughts leading up to the lines, apparently trying to justify them, but unfortunately depriving them of much of their comic impact."
1,this is not a canon product,"This is not a canon product. It was made by Cameron Sino. Mine came in a beat up old package and didn't have a guard over the terminal. Not that big of a deal except that I'm expecting that it has been sold and returned before based on it's condition. I chose this battery because of good reviews and so I was willing to pay more than the cheapest generic brand. I wish I would have chosen the cheapest 3rd party battery instead of paying more for this 3rd party unit. It is being returned. It might work fine, but I don't want to pay this much for a cheap knock-off brand."
3,battery charger needed??,Battery Pack NB-CP2L for Selphy CP-600/CP-330/CP-300 PhotoI just brought the Selphy printer and want the battery. do i need a recharging unit to recharge the battery or is there a charging unit on the printer itself? thanks
2,Overpriced,"Battery cost more than the printer, unless you have a need to print outside of your house, I would use the money for paper and ink refills."
5,The Bad Reviews Were Undeserved,"LOVE YOUR MAN by the Rossington Band received a lot of bad reviews when it came out because it departed from the traditional Lynyrd Skynyrd/Rossington-Collins Band sound and style, but these critical barbs were undeserved. While this album is much more like Heart or Foreigner than like Skynyrd or RCB, it's a great album on its own merits. The first side is wonderful, and the second side only slightly less so. If you love Skynyrd or RCB, you'll enjoy the Rossington Band."
5,Perfect,"So you want to watch a the Karate Kid Trilogy. Well it's fun, it's entertaining, it's harmless, it's predictable. Of course the original is the best, but the other two are not bad at all. The second one flows right from the first one nicely, but the third one is a bit of a stretch, and I don't think the acting is up to par of the other two. I am glad I have the trilogy and if you liked the original you will find the other two interesting. Always the bad guy and Daniel must overcome the odds. All three feel good movies."
4,A classic,Yes it seems dated. Yes the fight action is not that great. These are very family friendly movies with strong values and some pretty good acting. I am excited to have all three movies in one set. I watch this at least once a year!
2,...,Was written in on almost every page. Pages were torn. Definitely a waste of money. A couple of pages would have been understandable. Not most of the book.
4,"helps with that bit ""extra""","I love having this sort of book for the kids to do as i don't home school, so want to keep-up with what they're learning. All the School Zone publications are great products that i find help to re-enforce what they need to know, without the big gaps in age levels.My kids and I found this easy to go through and establish the basics. A bit bulky, but price is appropriate."
5,YEAH!,This workbook is WONDERFUL. There are 300ish pages of full color activities. It is well worth the money
3,Its okay,I was using the Everything for early education PreK book before this. My daughter has outgrown that one so I bought this to help her with the next level and I'm honestly not very impressed with the book. A big drawback for me is all the color. I like to be able to make copies of the handwriting pages and print them out. Kids are going to need to practice writing their letters and numbers more than one time to master the skill. I can't do that with this book because it is in color. Browsing through it I also saw several pages we will have to skip because the instructions or layout of all the colorful pictures will be confusing. Its not a bad book but not really what I need or want. I do like the kindergarten scholar section in the back to prep them for 1st. We will probably use that more. I also think its a waste of pages to include the answers. Kindergarten age children will most likley be doing this with an adult and adults shouldn't need an answer key to these activities.
2,So disappointed.,"I thought this would be a good way of cutting down on MY part of the homework time for my homeschooling child. After all, I'm taking care of my autistic daughter and my elderly mother who is showing some early signs of dementia. I'm thinking, I deserve a break somewhere, right? Well, it's just not meant to be for me I guess (at least not yet -- I haven't given up the fight). This was way below her skill level. Get ""What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know"" instead. No workbooks and no chapter summaries/synopsis/question/answer, but a good basic lesson plan from which to build."
4,Good book; beware buying from marketplace--earlier editions=same ISBN,"I looked at this book in a local store, and loved the variety of activities, and skill level that it contained (good for my preschooler). There were enough pages of each skill to teach and then practice.I ordered this from Amazon's marketplace. When I received the book, it looked completely different and even had different pages inside. Thinking that I got the wrong book from the seller, I double checked the ISBN, and it was the same. So, apparently when they updated the book (with the current pic shown on this site), they didn't change the ISBN. The new version is MUCH better; the older one has a lot of useless, boring skill sheets. If I had known this, I'd just have bought straight from Amazon. So, anyway, please be aware that you might not get the exact book you think you are getting, through no fault of the sellers on here (the did match the ISBN)."
4,"Book is great, but I am disappointed","The books are fantastic, and very engaging for children.I ordered two copies of this book for my same age children and was sent two different books; the covers were exactly the same but the interior pages were completely different. I was very disappointed with this oversight and urge other parents/educators who are purchasing the book in duplicate to check the interior before using or writing in the book.My children are displeased and one always thinks the other has a better 'page' to work on."
2,This was too easy........,"My daughter will be 5 in a month and it turns out that everything in this book, I'd already taught her with the exception of the counting money part; which I didn't need to purchase this 320 page book to only use about 20 pages out of this whole workbook. I will be returning promptly.I feel that the First Grade workbook was more suited for her needs...."
5,SOOKY SOOKY SOOKY NOW!!!,"THOSE WORDS SURE HAVE NEW MEANING AFTER READING ""FOR ALWAYS."" GONE GIRL WITH YOUR BAD SELF!! SURELY MS. FORD IS THE ""DIVA"" OF ROMANCE NOVELISTS. I STAND IN TOTAL AMAZEMENT THAT SUCH CREATIVITY IN THE BEDROOM CAN BE BROUGHT FORTH WITH SUCH MUCH CLARITY THAT YOUR BEDROOM BECOMES STEAMY. NOT ONLY CAN SHE EXCITE THE SENSES OF TOUCH, BUT GIRLFRIEND CAN SURROUND ALL THE LOVING WITH A DYNAMITE PLOT!! WHAT MORE CAN YOU WANT? THE STORY OF HEATHER AND QUIN WAS MAGNIFICIENT, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP EXTRAORDINARY. I CRIED WITH HEATHER WHEN SHE WAS AT HIS BEACH HOUSE AND HADN'T HEARD FROM HIM FOR A WHILE, AND I SURE REJOICED WHEN MR. FINE SHOWED UP AT THAT BEACH PARTY. ROMANCE LOVERS RUN, RUN, RUN AND DON'T STOP UNTIL YOU HAVE A COPY OF THIS BOOK IN YOUR SWEATY LITTLE HANDS. YOU WON'T REGRET IT."
5,Dealing With The Past,"I really enjoyed this book. Heather Gregory was like most women, looking for that everlasting love. Quinn Montgomery has been carrying around guilt for the past 5 years, feeling he was responsible for his wife's death. When these two meet to discuss Quinn's troubled daughter, the attraction is instant. Can Heather convince Quinn to let go of the past so they can share a love that will last for always?"
5,Amazing!,"This was a very sweet story, I really liked it ;)Bette Ford is a great author! Pick this book up you won't regret!"
4,Excellent!,"This was the first book by this author I have read and will DEFINITELY being reading more of her work. I bought the book mainly due to the positive reviews. I know a few people did feel the storyline was well formed. I totally disagree. The story of Quinn and Heather was very well formed. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars was because I think the end of the story could have been better a little better (I don't want to give away any of the story, but Quinn's indecisiveness wore a little on me). If you enjoy a good story with excellent love scenes this is the book for you."
5,For Always!!!,"This is the third book I've read of Bette Ford's. I had never heard of her before a friend loaned me one of her books. Very well written, kept me glued to my kindle. It was so good and proved that love and patience wins every time. Heather and Quinn, with Cynthia's troubles made for a beautiful love story."
4,Great high-output pickup,"I bought this pickup as a replacement for a stock pickup in a very low-end guitar to give it some character. It is a great improvement, and the pickup really shines when used when the amp has some crunch on it. The pickup is pretty high-output compared to everything else on my other guitars, so it's a bit difficult to rein in the sound and clean it up, but, as I said, it does crunch/gainy tones very well, and it's very reasonably-priced. The only reason why this pickup doesn't get 5 stars from me is simply because there are better pickups on the market--much pricier pickups, to be fair (Lundgren, BKP, etc), but I'd have to reserve a 5-star rating for them."
4,since the world began,Since the World began very informative with behind the scenes info. easy to navigate with tidbits of never heard of facts
4,A very good value!,"This book was a bargain when I ordered it from Amazon. It's a bit dated, but it still contains lots of great Disney inside information. I was hoping for a few more ""construction"" pictures, but overall it's a really good book."
1,Pretty crappy in my opinion,"Not only are the things listed in this book cheap trinkets but most everything in the book you have to pay $1.00 or $2.00 for. The stuff you do not have to pay shipping for are useless pamphlets and literature. There are a few things that are pretty cool and possibly some useful information for some folks but most everything is Junk. Plus a lot of the things listed are repeated through the book. Its like the author needed to add stuff and thought nobody would notice that several of the things were repeated. Overall this 31 page booklet was not worth the paper it was printed on. If you are interested in getting free things I would suggest finding ""freebie"" message boards on the internet."
1,free crap,"Really what demographic were these people trying to reach. You're better off having a bum teach you how to get free stuff you would get better stuff than what's in this book. Most of the stuff isn't even free, its cheap and its useless garbage. You probably shouldn't waste your money on this book folks it really is not worth it."
5,Unexpected romance.,"From back of the book: ""There's never been the woman yet who could hook Brad Rydall, and plenty have tried,"" they told Karen when she went to South Africa on a visit. Reluctantly she realized that she would indeed be wasting her time trying to attract him. But then Serena Harlow came on the scent...."
1,PAIN!,"In this Star Trek work based on a video game the main character receives the ability to go into a PAIN TRANCE. The idea being that when you are in this trance, you pass out and escape any pain the body may receive. Oh how I wished for this ability while the work was inflicted on me. The hapless stringing together of sections of the video game with a narration attempts to make this into a fluid work. It fails in amazing fashion. The video game roots are so obvious it is painful to listen too. The main charter dies over and over (much like you must during the game) and is set back on a boring path that makes no sense whatsoever. Even poor Q seems bored by the whole thing. Avoid."
4,"Good, but sizing a problem","These are super soft and I feel so good about buying an organic cotton product, but I think they have to fit rather snugly. Our son wears 18-24 month sizes and the pee just runs right out instead of getting trapped in the thick, absorbent part of the pants. I wish we could find a smaller size in these!"
3,"Not to be the monkey in the middle of the other two reviews, but...","The video is most definitely digital and not from VHS. Looks great on my 55"" 1080p TV played through blu-ray player.However, the announcer's voice is either soothing/boring/put you to sleep, depending on your taste, and they DO repeat snippets of both scenes and narration which gets annoying.I enjoyed it because it had some unique places like Lassen Peak and Badlands, which aren't always included on travel videos."
4,This is a great story,Friedman and Harrison did a wonderful job of blending what is essentially 300 year old story. It was great to find out what happened to the original crew of the Valiant and then the story moves on to explain the circumstances surrounding Picard's promotion to Captian. I read the entire book in two settings and enjoyed every minute of it.There are some plot issues such as how the survivors of the original Valiant all developed mental powers and how they managed to progress as a society in just 300 hundred years? Also we learn next to nothing about the aliens who are allegedly bent on invading our Galaxy other than they are violent and bent on conquest. Also how can class M planets or any solar systems exist in the void between galaxies?Nitpicking aside it is an entertaining story that should appeal to fans of the STNG series in general and Picard in particular.
5,Haven't Read it but will!,I have not read this book but I know it will be a big seller! I intend to read it!
1,Not Up to Par with Friedman's other ST novels,"I've read other ST novels by Michael Jan Friedman. Unfortunately, this one was the worst. The main section of the novel (which dealt with Picard taking command of the Stargazer) was by far the worst section. Picard didn't ring true, not even as a young Picard.The first and last sections (which dealt with the original crew of the Valiant) were the most interesting. Unfortunately, these couldn't carry the book. MJF has written other good Trek novels. This one wasn't up to their caliber."
3,It was good.,"This was a good but but I don't think it was the best. I found the Captain, or Picard to be too trusting even though he kept getting betrayed by the same poeple. I found that to be a bit too dramatic. Then, an alien tries to kill some of the crew and the next thing you know you got Picard allowing him access to phasers to defeat another threat. I don't get it. It was still good though but I think more time could have helped in developing it into a better story."
2,"Good Reference, Really BAD study guide","As a reference book, I'd give this book 4 stars. The information contained therein is good with only a few errors (the picture of the SCSI adapter on page 126 is upside down guys).However, as a study guide I'd only give this book one star. The end of chapter questions are lame. The sample test is lame.The biggest problem however is that the Server+ exam objectives are listed only on the inside front cover and in appendix B. To find information on a single exam objectives, you might have to read up to 7 chapters. There is not even an electronic copy of the book on the CD-ROM which comes with the book. An electronic copy of the book would at least make finding information on a particular topic easier (search). In fact the CD-ROM only has a little over 2MB of information (sample test) on it. The contents would easily fit on two floppy diskettes."
2,Ok book but not for the exam,"This book good at teaching you about server technologies, butI found that it didn't really relate properly for the exam.I thought the questions were poorly written and did notfollow the way the actual Server+ exam question are written.I also found too much irrelevant information in this book that was not exam related. It's a good book for a reference butI would not use this as your only study guide for the real exam"
5,Worth the wait,"Struggled throgh two other books before getting this one. It may have come out later than the others but it shows. More information and more comprehensive. Lots of discussion of best practice which is what alot of the test is. The test on the CD was good for the test - which I passed, and I guess thats all you can ask from a certification book."
2,Pass on this one,I found this book hard to use to study for the Server+ exam. It was very hard to find out where the objectives map to the text by having to flip back and forth from the front of the book to the specific chapter!! It has it's share of typos and technical errors. Now I can see why this book is going for so cheap.
3,"OK, but disorganized!","This book is OK, with the normal number of typos and factual errors. However, my biggest complaint is that it is very disorganized. An appendix maps the CompTIA exam objectives to the multiple chapters in the book where the material for each of the objectives can be found. Since, I'm try to study for specific exam objectives where I think I'm week, this book is very hard to use. I'm going to be returning this book and search for another."
3,"For Learning, NOT for memorizing","Passed on first try Friday but just barely. Used only this book and truly read it from cover to cover. Also used some transcender sample questions and another Certification Bible CD for quizzing. The actual exam was harder than any practice questions I used. CompTIA's wordings were inverted and they actually test for thorough working knowledge rather than making sure I memorized any questions. All the info needed is contained in this fine prep book but a complete understanding of what I read was mandatory. Before studying this or the Server+ Certification Bible, I highly recommend, as I did, reading the real Bible. Then you'll have everything needed to pass the exam!"
1,Driver side in the box,"I needed a right and a left handle for my mustang. Ordered a right and a left at the same time, left was in the left box, left was in the right box, both Dorman. Ordered another right, sure enough it was another left in the right box, another Dorman. Filed with Amazon to get a replacement. They sent one out immediately, sure enough another left in a right box. Can't seem to return this one via the website. Got on ebay and ordered a right and a left at the same time, and sure enough I received a right and a left, not dorman."
5,"ADorable, high quality, great details, good price","I love these little furball clothes. But the ones that stand out for good or for bad, get reviewed. This one is great! My father was in construction so I love the theme, but the details are really great. The tools really make the difference. I would dock it a star for being basic jeans and a t-shirt but the suspenders and tools make it worth it for sure, so there' no docking of stars here! Great seller, as always. Can't beat free shipping, and always so fast."
3,Half book,"The book is divided in 2 parts. The first part is the 1921 match, and is very good because is written for Capablanca. The second part is the 1927 match, is writen for 2 english players, which make very short comments."
5,Great product,"Product came exactly as described. I had previously ordered this product through QVC, but since it is no longer available there I will continue to purchase through amazon. I definitely noticed that my teeth were whiter after only a few uses. Easy to apply and does not taste bad, much better than any whitestrips I have used."
1,False advertising!,"I have purchased BriteSmile pens in the past from my dentist for $100 for a 3-pack, so when I saw this I thought, ""what a great deal""! I received 3 pens labeled ""whitening pen"" in a Manila envelope with a typed ""instruction sheet"". These are clearly NOT BriteSmile pens. When I contacted the seller they assured me the pens were ""just as good if not better than BriteSmile"" and to ""give one a try"". She did offer to refund me if I wasn't satisfied. I have absolutely no idea what's in the pens and I'm certainly not putting the unknown substance in my mouth! If it's not BriteSmile, a reputable brand, don't label it as such! I've contemplated contacting BriteSmile directly to inform them of copyright infringement."
2,Stay Single,"I've had yellow teeth for 60 years. I was told it was a medicine my mother took when she was pregnant. I've never been in a financial situation that allowed for cosmetic fixes of any kind, so every couple years I give these products a try, only to be disappointed. I suppose it would work on teeth that are stained, but for those of us with naturally off-colored teeth, they will not whiten. So short of winning the lottery or marrying the Donald I'll have to live with the teeth I was born with. Actually I'd rather live with these teeth than marry the Donald."
4,Great for touchups but....,"...thats about it. I have tried crest whitening strips which did work more effectively but if you dont have patience and/or perfectly straight teeth, its a pain to work with. With these whitening pens, its easy to apply but it does take longer (about 3x longer) to get the same results as you would get with strips. My suggestion is get professional whitening treatment, then use these pens for touchups. Remember teeth are like white shirts. Anything you throw at it, will stain it so having these pens handy help alot. I keep a pen in my car for when im out, or after lunch break at work, ill rinse my mouth and use this pen. If you decide to go this route, i suggest getting their toothpast or some sort of whitening pre-rinse mouthwash. Because its good to have your front teeth white but you should also worry about the other parts of your teeth getting white too."
2,Works but beware,"Maybe it was completely a coincidence, but one of my molars developed resorption shortly after I started using this product. I used it again months later (had to have that molar pulled and had a dental implant placed), and my teeth become very sensitive and hurt if I use this product for a couple of days. It does whiten teeth, but I don't want to take any chances with my teeth."
4,I have a bright smile with Brite Smile!!,"This is my 2nd time buying Brite Smile over the years. I Love this product. It hasn't made my teeth whiter than white but.... it has improved my smile by more than 75%. If you have sensitive teeth you don't have to worry with this product. I would recommend this product and let people know that this isn't one of those teeth whiteners that promises something that it ""can't"" deliver. It actually and realistically works."
1,WHITEN PEN,"THIS PRODUCT DID NOTHING FOR ME.. MY TEETH ARE THE SAME AS THEY WERE. GLAD IT WAS ONLY 1.33.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE, IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS JUST PUTTING WATER ON MY TEETH."
5,easy and works,"Much better than crest whitestrips. I hated having to put the strips on, having them on, and taking them off. The pen i can apply quickly whenever i think of it and then go about my day with no after effects. Plus it is gratifying because you start to see results after just the first couple of days."
4,Blank Stage Gun,"The Model 911 Auto 8MM Stage blank firing pistol is very authentic in its appearance and it feels like the real thing. It balances nicely and has the weight of the real gun.The only problem I had with it is a dud cartridge. The dud wasn't the fault of the gun but I discovered that the gun uses the force of the blank cartridge when it fires to eject from the firing chamber and then loads the next cartridge from the clip. If a dud is encountered you must manually remove the cartridge thus ruining the effect of the scene if you're using the pistol for stage acting. This is the same functionality of a real pistol but with real pistols I've used it's easier to clear the dud cartridge from the firing chamber. Too avoid this problem, get high quality blanks.Other than that I really like the pistol and it gives the effect of using a real gun in a play very well."
2,A Tourette syndrome caricature,"I was disappointed by Halpern's portrayal of a boy with Tourette Syndrome (TS). She employs a caricature of the disorder by focusing on one fairly rare aspect, copralalia, impulsive swearing. More, the boy is a danger to others and must be institutionalized. Anyone with even slight familiarity with TS will know this characterization is very, very far from the typical person with the disorder. TS is often so subtle that it goes unnoticed. Of course, it's Halpern's story and she's free to use a caricature. But the book's naive scholarly apparatus--footnotes, appendixes--gives the impression that the novel may serve as a sort of primer on TS. It can't. Anyone interested in really learning about this much misunderstood syndrome should begin by visiting the website of the Tourette Syndrome Association tsa.org"
4,"Soft, beautiful color","This review is in comparison to other small pre-packaged wool roving, which are typically more expensive than bulk.I was a bit skeptical buying this since there were many negative reviews. However, it was cheap so I took a chance an am very glad I did. I'd bought other wool roving for needle felting and this was by far the softest I've bought. The price is about the same as other wool roving of this type - though it comes in a small package, the strands are combed out, folded, and compressed to fit into the packaging. The strands, however, are much shorter than I've worked with when I pulled some out, which took a bit more work to get used to.I bought the blue and it's a beautiful color."
2,"Not horrible, but I expected much more.","I am a big fan of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and think it is one of the best animated works of all time. So when I heard that there were OVAs I knew I had to get them. However I was really let down by these. Each episode is around 15 minutes in length and tells its own story, but none of them prove to be anything too interesting or exciting. Considering how low the price is, if you're a die-hard FMA fan you might want to pick it up just to see what it is, but I'd recommend watching somewhere else before buying."
3,"It's interesting to see these untold stories, but not much bang for your buck.","I am probably the biggest FMA fan there is, but I was let down by this offering. I own every piece of the Full Metal Alchemist anime universe and this was the most disappointing. It is a fun watch through and definitely worth seeing, however I probably wont watch it again. I would recommend Renting or borrowing this if possible because it isn't really worth the price of admission."
2,Can't I just get the DVD?,"I love FMA, and I have seen the OVAs. I would love to get them, but really... does it have to be a Blu-ray combo pack? Seriously. I just want the DVD... the only reason they make the combo packs is to force people to buy them, cause no one buys them on their own. They do it with the Disney movies, and now they are doing it with this.Seriously. Just the DVD please."
1,Poor quality,"My son has many Stikfas, but this one was terrible quality plastic, with sharp edges and lots of breakage, and we returned it."
1,Piece of Junk,It is so brittle that just trying to put it together caused several pieces to snap. I can't imagine anyone playing with this.
2,Nice but broke.,"Like others, when putting it together the joints broke. Male stikfas figures have thicker parts and more stronger. They need to use better plastic."
1,Cheap Plastic,"My experience echoes the first post.I have several Stikfas, and the last group I ordered, I ran into issues with the plastic breaking during assembly.I was looking to purchase a figure just for replacement parts when I saw the review, and decided to share my similar experience.I thought it might simply have been a bad batch, but now I'm wondering if I should even buy another..."
3,Not good for an Army Builder,"I purchased this a while back hoping to find a good Army Builder. Not so much.......It is very small, and the articulation is not so great. Although it looks really cool and detailed actual posing is out of the question.I eventually stripped him of all of his gear to include his MOLLE gear and everything else. After that I rid myself of the figure.Pros:DetailedCool gear that is hard to findGreat M-4 w/M203Great headgearCool packCons:The actual figureThe pistol is not removable from the holster.I know you are probably like, ""Wow look at the Pros to the Cons"" however, his gear was used on custom Soldiers. Get if you customize figures. It's a good price for a good amount of gear. If you plan on having a cool figure, look elsewhere. Very disappointed with this figure."
4,Pretty good but missing some things,"Just saw a rebroadcast of this last night. This is probably one of the best documentaries about the early punk scene I've seen but it does a disservice to punk bands that were around in the early/mid eighties . It does a good job of covering the beginnings from the Velvet Underground, MC5, Iggy Pop to the CBGB New York scene (Talking Heads, Ramones, Blondie, Patti Smith). Spends a lot of time on the Sex Pistols (too much IMHO). Then it spends about 2 minutes on the LA scene (X)and then jumps to Nirvana (??!!). What about the Circle Jerks, Black Flag, Fear,the Avengers, the Dead Kennedys, T.S.O.L., Social Distortion, the Minutemen, JFA, Minor Threat, Bad Brains, Scream, Sonic Youth, etc, etc (to name just a few)...?? I'm guessing they were probably trying to connect to the audiences at the time and everybody had heard of Nirvana, but they skipped a lot of great and influential bands. Maybe there should be a part 2?"
2,Don't Buy It,"After ordering my copy of VideoHound's World Cinema: The Adventurer's Guide to Movie Watching I must say that I was rather disappointed in the hound. Okay, lets say that you are not familiar to any of the directors in the book and you read a review and check out the film and you love what you see. You will probably want to check out other pieces of work by this same director. Unfortunately the Videohound World Cinema book does not list all of the works of cool foreign directors, even of films made outside the U.S. For example, David Cronenberg has a wimpy film list in the back of the book with a mere three films. The book has completely overlooked great campy Italian horror directors like Lucio Fulci. What I am saying is that the book is far from complete and needs a whole lot of additions. If I were you, find another source book and avoid this hound dog."
2,Not very good,"Out of the sixty-five tricks listed in the book, I found about ten that were worth attempting. I like to do tricks on a spur of the moment with a borrowed deck, and this book added very little to my repetoire. There are too many tricks which need a setup or require you to mark cards beforehand. Also, alot of the tricks have too many steps (your audience will get bored, just as mine did). My final say is don't buy this book, it's not worth it; get a good sleight-of-hand video instead."
4,Kingdom is Relevant,"i thought that the book was a great introduction to the idea of the kingdom of God and its role in the entire Bible. The book was written in a scholarly fashion, but was accessible to anyone with Biblical knowledge. It sets a great foundation for anyone who is serious about critical Biblical interpretation and especially the influence of the Kingdom of God on the Bible. It brought me great insight and appreciation to what the Bible discusses about Kingdom and its power in my own life."
4,"For Those Seeking the ""Big Picture""","Glasser does an amazing job here of presenting the unified, progressive story of Scripture. The Church is addicted to verse-by-verse, ""zoomed-in"" interpretation of the Bible. This work is a must-read if you are sometimes puzzled the seemingly eclectic way the Bible is put together. If you wonder ""where is God going with this?"", you will find the answer here.Scripture has a message at all levels, but I will dare to say the most important message is found at the meta-level. This book is that message. And we cannot let it become lost among the thousands of smaller passages and lessons that support it.Four stars only because Glasser doesn't do a wonderful job countering SOME of the inevitable assumptions of American, individualist evangelicalism. But all works are limited by time and space, so I don't fault him for it too much."
3,"used as a text book, bit hard to get into but thorough",It was a bit hard to get into but thorough. Helpful for understanding missions right from the beginning of the bible.
3,Helpful for anyone in a corporate setting,"Although the title is somewhat misleading, this is a pretty good book for anyone working in a corporate environment. A more accurate title for this book would have been ""How to communicate effectively with different types of people in your organization"", because that's exactly what this book may help you to do. Anyone experiencing ""communication problems"" in their organization could benefit from the examples and suggestions provided by Deep and Sussman. I especially recommend this book for anyone working in the Human Resource department and anyone else with coaching or counseling responsibilities. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me - adamleft@webspan.net."
2,What a disappointment!,"I really wanted to like this book and tried chapter after chapter to offer the benefit of the doubt. But, as pages turned, I found more contradictory statements and words of advice than anything else. For example, the authors teach that managers should not use the word ""you"" when confronting fellow workers. Then, on page 85, the authors suggest handling ""snake"" personalities by saying: ""I know what YOU did."" Similarly, the authors state that managers should shift their verbage from ""what do you want"" to ""why do you want it?"" However, on page 84, the authors suggest asking difficult colleagues the question of ""what is it you would like me to do?"" To end positively, I will say that the book offers very good examples of well-recognized office behaviors. The text would be so much more effective if the authors had consisently reinforced their positions on subjects, which they suggest in chapter five as a professional behavior we all should practice religiously."
2,Not quite what I was wanting,"I found that a lot about this book just missed the mark with me. If you understand what the book is about and want to read the entire thing to help get along with coworkers, I think it could be very helpful for someone else."
3,DS9 Centering on Quark and Rom,"This is my first Deep Space Nine novel. My son and I got into the series (which I totally missed in first run because of living in Taiwan) and I promised not to watch any episodes without him. To fill the gap, I thought why not try a book. The 34th rule of acquisition is War is Good for Business (keep in mind the 35th rule is Peace is Good for Business). In general DS9 does a lot that ST can't do, and the core of that difference is the many different people and cultures that are central to the station. This book centers are Quark and his brother Rom who seem to be caught up in some plan of the Grand Nagus. Too many threads are spun out and not enough detail is flushed out in the end. That is kind of the weakness of DS9 in general though."
1,Tedious Ego,"I have to admit that I tried reading this book four times. Each time I would get part way into it and still feel the same, and put it aside. I will read through just about ANYTHING, so I am suprised at myself for this attitude. Quark is seen as insufferable and weak, which maybe a reflection of his true inner self, but it made for tedious reading. I saw a lack of what makes the Frengi character so exciting, his internal and external debate between the ""humane"" and Frengi perspectives of the world. I found not only the Quark character insufferable, but the writing style wordy and insipid. I've read all the Star Trek series books and I put this one down at the bottom of my list with great agony."
1,Punishment...Pain...Anguish...,"Three words that describe this trainwreck of a movie starring the ""Chico Without the Man"", Freddie Prinze Jr. I'm sure 14 year old girls think that he's just wonderful, and the hoochie models were thrown in to attract male movie goers but this movie has no redeeming value whatsoever. Freddie can't act, in fact most of the cast of this waste of film had trouble with the whole ""acting thing"". Monica Potter's bleating and whining made my ears bleed. Please Mr. Hollywood Producer, stop making these movies already!"
1,"Boo, Hiss for ""Head Over Heels"" !","What a total disappointment and waste of an evening! The premise of the movie was cute and had great potential, but was totally overshadowed by obscene, vulgar, and distasteful jokes and inuendo. The leads were adorable and had great chemistry but not enough to compensate for the off-color scenes. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy (if I had one). Two big thumbs down."
2,it was an okay silly movie,"I think freddie printz is a hottie but this film didnt excit e me like his other film, she all that. I guess if the movie had more popular actors and actress then it could've been a abetter movie. The other films he played in he was with other well known actors. The director could ve hired better people for their roles. THe actress, Ms. Potter was dull and she was too boring. I recommend this movie to any one who is home bored and ther is nothing on tv . Otherwise save your money and wait till it comes on tv to tape it. I expected a better film. I am very very sad. I still love my fpjr."
4,THE PERFECT MAN?,"Title - Head Over Heels (2001) 87 minDirector - Mark S. WatersUniversal StudiosPlot - A down to earth, decent girl, has given up on believing the right man exist after many past romantic failures.CastAmanda - Monica PottersJim/Bob - Freddy Prinze Jnr.This comedy takes place in New York, centered around the fashion industry. Because of recent tragedies in the romantic department of her life, Amanda has given up on finding ""the perfect man"". Her first encounters with Jim, possibly ""the one"", are hilarious. The airhead models she rooms with add to the humor. The humor becomes outrageous when Amanda and her friends begin to investigate Jim, believing he committed a crime. The situations they find themselves in will keep you in stitches."
4,It's really not that bad.,"You have seen all the bad reviews, but I have to say, it's really not that stupid. First of all, you obviously can not expect a story that's going to change your life, it's only a teen movie! Secondly, it had a light and believable plot, and many funny moments; it was a healthy movie (I can't believe people are giving this 3 star average while giving American Pie 4.5). What I am trying to say is, if you are a young girl, or a light-hearted boy, you really wouldn't get disappointed at the movie."
3,"A sweet, funny movie","Many fans of romantic comedy won't like the bathroom humor and sexual humor that reign in this Freddie Prinze Jr. movie. Then again, it is from the writers of There's Something About Mary, and it is funny. Most critics hated this movie; some critics won't even watch anything with Freddie Prinze Jr. But I liked it. This is a sweet, funny movie. The action scenes won't exactly have you on edge, but the comedy and the romantic chemistry work."
2,Head Over Heels,"This movie is mildly entertaining, but definitely not a keeper. Freddie Printz Jr. is very nice to look at, but he isn't a strong enough leading male actor to carry off the lead. Monica Potter was surprisingly good as the female lead. I didn't buy the chemistry between the two of them because it felt forced. The supporting cast was pretty good, and they did provide some laugh out loud moments. Overall, the movie was just too silly to get interested in."
3,More fun than you'd imagine it to be,"Billed more as a romantic comedy than anything else, this one only works if you go see it to laugh with the four women playing the Greek chorus of supermodels who help their new roommate (Monica Potter) get the guy of her dreams (Freddie Prinze, Jr., whatever) whom she keeps watching work out in his room from her window across the street (whatever). One day Potter thinks she sees Prinze commit murder and now what to do about it? Prinze's inability to convince us that he's over nineteen saps much of the film's credibility, but the many funny moments involving the girls will you keep you interested throughout. Potter's uncanny ability to look and sound like Julia Roberts will creep you right out of your skin."
3,HAHAHAHAHA!,"Well I never thought that movie that looked this cheap was going to be so entertaining and simply fun, this supposed to be a cliche movie, but it has something different, of course has obvious turns and predictible endings but this movie was simply fun to watch....truly recommended for those lazy sunday afternoon without nothing to do. The lead actress Monica Potter is a Julia Roberts look-a-like with blonde hair don't you think."
5,One of the FUNNIEST Movies of the Year!!!!!,"More people should have seen this movie!!!! It's one of the funniest movies I have ever seen!! I laughed so hard I cried!! Freddie Prinze Jr. and Monica Potter and hilarious and the models are even funnier!! Take me word, rent this movie and you won't regret it!! Rent it for laughs, not a serious plotline!!"
1,This suuucccckkkkssss!!!!!!!!!!!,Avoid at all costs I was tortured by this thrash on a transatlantic flight. This gets a star because I can't post a review without giving it something. It is like a watered down Clueless with out jokes (any jokes).
1,Flush this movie,"First half of the movie actually quite creative and entertaining. However then it appears they ran out of material, so they went with old Howard Stern type 12 year old toilet/gas jokes - comparable only to Dumb and Dumber in its utter depravity.Gee, why not just hook up the underwater toilet cam next time, and really get some big laughs, I am sure the 12 olds would love it."
3,Confusing,"I found this when I did a search for ""Chilly Scenes of Winter."" While ""Chilly Scenes of Winter"" was released on video under the title ""Head Over Heels,"" this is not the same movie. That said, this is a cute movie, though lightweight."
3,"uneven, light as a feather","The first half hour is very good (until the makeover scene), and then things never quite jell again. Prinze and Potter are well-cast, and the models are a lot of fun, but what's with the toilet jokes? This isn't a movie for teenage boys, so I'm baffled about why that stuff is in this movie. If you think that you'd like it from the previews and reviews, I believe that you will, but it could have been much better with this cast."
4,Neil Simon would be proud,"Head Over Heels is cut from the same cloth as Plaza Suite and Barefoot in the Park. It's a light, off-the-wall comedy about jumping to conclusions and the chaos that comes of it.Monica Potter and her model roomies are a riot with their inept investigation of suspected bad-boy Freddie Prinze Jr.. Add that to a sub-plot of international espionage during New York's fashion week, and everyone's in for a wild ride.Just sit back with your popcorn, turn off your brain and have a good time with this one."
4,a romance with a diffrence,this is one of thoses movies thats a funny out look on romance.its about a girl in her 20s thats has to find a new apartment and ends up living with four modols . she meets this fine looking guy (freddie) and goes weak at the knees for him he feels the same for her but this movie has a few surprises up its sleave and with his life and her paramoa tells no telling what will happen.it funny and will real pick you up if you dont buy it rent it . its worth a watch
4,A knee-bender movie,I don't normally go for romance-comedy stuff coz I would rather leave it to the younger generation to appreciate it more. But I found this movie quite funny. No offense meant to models...but the stupidity of these models made me laugh my heart off. Am not a Freddie Prinze fan so I cannot say he's great in this movie. But I think he & Monica had the right chemistry to make this film a lovable one.
1,Are there words to say how bad this is?,"I actually like Freddie Prinze a lot, and Monica Potter is the gorgeous version of Julia Roberts (which is meant as a compliment), but this movie stinks big time. Other reviewers have told the story, so there's no point on repeating it; just know that there are no jokes in the movie, at least not a good one, it all comes down to Freddie looking good and cool, Monica looking beautiful and in shock the whole movie, a bunch of sick, dull eschatological jokes (none of which appeared to have any effect on the audience), and a sad, sad portrayal of pretty women. Don't waste your time or money, it's not worth it, better wait for the release on TV"
5,HEAD OVER HEALS,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE I WATCH IT WITH MY HUSBAND AND WE WERE LAUGHING OUR HEADS OFF, ITS A VERY GOOD MOVIE. VERY VERY FUNNY"
2,Meh...,"All the beautiful people in this movie --and there are plenty of them-- can't make this movie attractive. ""Rear Window"" as a comedy is a great idea, but the film is hobbled by a lame screenplay, full of cliches and lacking in laughter, and bad acting. Yes, Freddie Prinze Jr. is very cute, but he can't act to save his life."
4,Does anyone know the name of the song????,"Does anyone know the name of the song that is played while they are at the aquarium, when jim takes amanda there for the first time."
1,Quality is beyond the pale,"Ghost and the Guest is a clever ""B"" comedy, unfortunately the quality is so awful the DVD is not worth the excruciating 56 minutes it takes to watch it. It's a bit like staring through gauze.Pass this one by."
2,A hodgepodge of old Morey Amsterdam jokes,"This Alpha Video presentation is almost up to their standards.Webster and Jackie Fry (James Dunn and Florence Rice) are just married; we have no idea why. They are given a farm and inherit a body. The standard body disappears and the house seems haunted. We see ridiculously dumb police, wise cracking newlyweds, a hangman with more ""Morey Amsterdam one-liners"". For some reason there is a comic relief chauffer. And a peeping Tom. The film goes from bad to worse.""A lots of dummies can walk."" and ""I've got brains I never even used yet.""Mabel Todd as the ditzy Little Sister Mabel"
3,SPOOKY HOUSE!!!!!,The Ghost and the Guest is one of P.R.C.'s better productions. It deserves better treatment than an Alpha release. The dark scenes are hard to see and there is some footage missing.
3,Held up to weather,"Had this in a constant sun, high temp environment and it seemed to hold up well. Good no frills cable."
4,Exceptionally Excellent!,"I purchased my first Y.F.C c.d. yesterday (August 1, 06') and I love it. I call it ""exceptionally excellent"" because I feel it has some hot hits on it. But Oooh, I love that ""The Struggle Is Over"" feat. Jonathan Nelson and that ""I will bless You Lord"". O my...I love it. I was also glad to hear Troy Sneed too. He is a powerful (effective) praise and worship leader. He also has a wonderful album out that I like too. But eh, BUY THE C.D.! The c.d. is great and the songs aren't too hard for say, your local church's youth choir to sing. I know my church's youth chorale gon have to sing ""The Struggle Is Over""! What a ministry...What a ministry!"
1,Shame On Arista!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Like Dionne Warwick, Arista records has Repacked The same material, nothing new....not even one new title to cd. All of this classic group's studio albums have to be issued on cd in any country...There is so much fans due not have on cd....Shame on arista for wanting another $10 from fans for the same songs!"
4,excellent,"You would be logical thinking this sounds a little sparce, but also be wrong.The musicality of Max Roach's drumming and the full orchestrative and percussive qualaities of Cecil Taylor's panio make these long improvosations rich as any great jazz quartet.Taylor was a student of all of jazz history and his choice to work with Roach is obvious. Though Roach was first a be-bopper, his working with one of the father's of the jazz avant-gaurde fits like a glove.Typical of Max, inventing at every turn on his albums with Clifford Brown, the Impulse douPercussion Bitter SweetandIt's Time, and later work likeScott Free."
4,TOMMY TROUBLES,"there are 5 Episodes shown on this tape: ""Naked Tommy""Is Funny,but also a bit strange to other episodes. to other Episodes.""incident in aisle 7""Good, pretty funny, To! ""Baseball Tommy""GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Not at all to complex and slick.Its a classic for all. ""Rebel Without a teddy bear""Aqain,great-not at all complex, but a bit dark since it isn't funny.Its Really a bad ""kid"" thing.It has a bad concept.It is a slick one. ""The Missing Rugrat"" Great-NOT AT ALL SLICK !!!or complex. All in all,4 out of 5 are good,so 4 stars."
4,GREAT TOY!,"My 6 year old grandson LOVES this toy. He plays with it constantly, even over his bigger Hot Wheels sets. He takes it with him in the car, it can be played with just about anywhere. It is sturdy, has held up very well, and my grandson is not dainty with his toys. I thought it was on the expensive side for the size and what is included, but it has been worth it. I would recommend this toy for any 6 year old who loves trucks and playsets in general."
1,Ummm,I still havent received the book... It has not arrived at my home yet. Ive waited for a while and so far nothing has come.
5,Great service!,The product arrived in a timely manner and experienced no problems from the vendor...definitely would purchase future texts from them.
1,This book is terrible!!!!,"This is the worst book I have ever read!!!!! To say the authors are redundant would be an understatement. Yet somehow they manage to be repetitive but unclear all at the same time. You can read a chapter three times and still not know what something means or the point they're trying to make. It's written more like a review of literature than a text book. There are no case studies, just research and findings that other, more adequate, professionals have come up with. This is the most boring textbook I own. I hate that I bought it."
2,One of the least helpful textbooks I have ever read.,"The author of this text obviously does not care about his readership and their cognitive ability to be able to glean any useful information from his text. I have had to re-read sentences up to eight times before I can guess at his meaning, and I still am not sure why the author chose to be as redundant and dull as possible. I imagine if you are buying this book, it is required. I suggest you borrow or buy it used for as cheap as possible, as I assume you will never want to touch it- much less READ it ever again."
3,Not the best Star Trek book I've ever read,I thought it was kinda depressing since Bashir died (hes my favorite character) but the plot is good other than that and the fact everyone but the boring characters are killed...
4,"Centers on Quark and Odo, fast-paced and compelling.","Fallen Heroes is a fast-paced and very well written action-packed story of the battle to save Deep Space Nine from an invasion. It features all of the usual characters , but centers on Odo and Quark, admirably describing the idiosyncrasies of their relationship. It has humor, but is also filled with death. Its only fault may be the way that Odo and Quark discover each body, and then we have to read through how it happened. But since it is interesting and often compelling, this task is never really tedious. In Fallen Heroes, as in The Siege by Peter David, Odo is late for his sleep period but the action won't allow him a moment's rest. Therefore, we find Odo constantly waxing heroic while trying desperately not to melt. It seems that if Odo is your main character, make him late for bed and you've got instant suspense. His final act of heroism will have you grinning at Hugh's originality and imagination. Definitely a good read."
5,best star trek books,mr.hugh is one the best star trek writers he's right up there with peter david for his great plots wonderful action and always alot of humor thrown in to keep your attention. Fallen heroes is a great example of what a good star trek book can be.8~)
5,"Finally, the main charaters DIE!",This book has great story. It lets you see the battle and its aftermath at the same time. A good read for any Trek fan
3,A bloody Star Trek thriller,"Is it possible? A bloody Star Trek thriller?Sometimes very thrilling, sometimes evensplattery. For me a lot too much blood, althoughthe story is believable and the main characters of Odo and Quark a very well written. Because of theleak of the Star Trek idea, I can only give it a 6. For a thriller in general I would give a 9."
5,The best DS9 book there is!,A warship takes over DS9 using phaser reflective armor and projectile weapons. They destroyed the stations's power source and picked off each officer one by one. This book tells of the struggle to survive in the face of adversity. A great book for all Star Trek fans!
3,okay,"good general discussion of the mathematical foundations of computation, but very little material on how the theoreticalwork in the early 20th century was transferred to working machines."
2,Horngen's book better,I am currently inplementing a project/job accounting system. This book was fine as an overview but of little use otherwise. Horngren's Cost Accounting - A Managerial Emphais was also purchased. Horngren's book was better as an overview and for the theory and details of implemtation.
3,Evades a lot of the issues,"This brief book, intended for a lay audience, is one of a series by Gerald Edelman. It lays out his concepts of the neural basis of consciousness, but I, as a neuroscientist, found it very disappointing. The problem was not the level of simplification required for helping the intended audience grasp the terminology and basic concepts of neuroscience. Rather, my discontent stemmed from Edelman's raising of testable hypotheses and then unceremoniously dropping them. For example, he posits that higher consciousness arises evolutionarily at the transition from reptiles to mammals, but he never goes on to discuss how one would really assess this intriguing idea. Can you find neuroantomical or physiological differences in the two groups that can reveal deep insights into consciousness? We are never told."
1,Poor and incomplete,"Edelman uses overly complicated language to describe consciousness. He repeatedly uses abbreviations C and C'. To stand for the underlying neural process of consciousness. Furthermore, he would have us assume that consciousness itself, actually did nothing, but it is the neural substrate ( of consciousness) that does the work for consciousness. That is basically saying anger does not cause, or help in causing, me to hit someone. It was all the neuron's fault. In my opinion, Damsio's series of books does a lot better in every aspect of explaining consciousness including:1. explaining the purpose of consciousness2. why it evolved3. future implications in the scientific study of consciousness"
4,Wider Than The Sky,"Seems like a good overview of consciousness, a topic that has intrigued me for a long time. Have not seriously read most of book yet, only browsing and selected pages."
2,If you are wide awake at the end of this cd you can stand any torture,I not even a fan of Gram but his is way better then Conner. Atleast when he sang with Harris it made the songs better. Conner would have been better of just hiring and unknown to do the harmonies and dueting because Harris does not add anything to these songs and she has gotten boring all she does now is sing on other peoples songs. He does even know how to write decent melodies and the last song he stole from ode to joy because he cant write good music on his own. Do not listen to critics that think this cd is good they get paid to listen to stuff like this and they do not know what regular people like to listen to
2,Great Music - Ruined by the CD,"It is truly a shame that the experience of the music is ruined by protection on the cd, which subsequently prevents the cd from playing properly on my computer. I find it exceptionally sad that I am being restricted from listening to music that I have legally purchased as I see fit to listen to it. I believe it's absolutely necessary to review this cd poorly, because it is the physical cd that is purchased, not the music; if it were the music that were purchased, then I would not be restricted from listening to it as I wish. Potential buyers take note - this cd does not work in a CDROM drive(although Bright Eyes concurrent release, Digital Ash In A Digital Urn, will)."
2,Bright eyes- not voice,"Not sure why all the hype. This was a well below average album musically, in my opinion. The quivering voice, the below average harmonies. Lyrics were fine, but I'll know to stay away another time."
4,Wonderful.,"I put four stars because compared to the records put out by other artists, this record is definitely a 5, but compared to previous efforts from Conor, this album is only a 4. Lua, First Day of my Life and Poison Oak are my favourite songs off the album."
4,Not my favorite,"But, it's Bright Eyes, so it's still pretty amazing. I love their music period. They really can do no wrong."
3,"Some hit, some miss.","Yeah, so...my girlfriend calls him Bright Balls, and tells him to ""Cheer up, emo kid!"" Not that that has anything to do with this CD, I just find it funny. This is part of a two disk set of sorts with 'Digital Ash In A Digital Urn' being the other. There are some really great tracks on this CD with 'Lua' topping the list. There are also a few tracks I dislike, 'Another Traveling Song' being the biggest offender. I usually can't sit through this entire album like I could with 'Digital Ash', 'Lifted', or 'Letting Off'. Mr. Oberst has a unique singing and songwriting style, which I enjoy very much, but this album is probably his weakest release.P.S. - I am not under 13, just lazy ;)"
