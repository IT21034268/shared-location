1,If you want a soft voice buy Sarah Brightman,I am glad that she has such a voice for a young age but she is singing songs that were not made for children ( no offence to her loyal fans ) but if your looking for a similar voice but with artistry with also similar songs buy Sarah Brightman she is afterall a Diva. If you are looking for power though look no further than Maria Callas the godess of them all has it all. Church is no more then Andrea Bocelli ( a wanna be opera singer that should really stick to pop )
1,Pop-style rendering doesn't work for operatic material!,"Charlotte Church does indeed have a lovely voice, but she doesn't yet have the control most of this material deserves. Handel and Bach should be served up with style and personality, both of which Ms. Church has in abundance, but also require precision and technique, which are lacking here. That said, the popular tunes are delivered nicely, if that's your cuppa."
1,Not even one star,"I, too, am a classically trained singer, and I am not impressed with Charlotte. Everything that needs to be said about her frightening flawed technique, bland presentation, and de-void of any emotion delivery has been said.However, it is good to know that people that do not usually listen to classical music appreciate it more because of her. I just hope the more they listen to more classical music (and GOOD singers!), they will realize that Charlotte is NOT an opera singer....Thank you....I feel better now."
3,"O mio babbino caro O MAY!! Feb,24,2004","Miss Charlotte is now going for opera songs, But her singing in O Mio was scary! The singer has to hit 5 high A flats! That is not an easy thing to do even opera singers who are old enough to sing it have trouble. They mute sound a litti bit squeeky, but it is much better then sounding like you are screaming to hit the high notes! I feel she should try something else.If you are looking for a opera diva, this is not it! The 3 stars are for making a good effort at other songs in the CD and for the good mucic in the backgruond! Keep trying Charlotte!"
2,Good marketing,"Sounds like many a talented singer in her first year of conservatory. As she matures I hope her diction will settle and she'll be able to avoid accenting difficult unaccented high notes--that takes incredible muscles and it wouldn't be fair to expect them to be in place this early in her career. I forsee a great future for this singer-- especially given the market forces supporting her at this point. --Matt Fields, composer"
4,"If she can do this now, what will she do AFTER she studies?","I read several reviews of this CD and I have to admit its really a hot topic. Now I'm not a singer (so I don't have an axe to grind) but I am a great lover of Opera, and Mozart in particular. My only dissappointment with this album what that the Figaro aria was translated. As far as Charlotte Church's voice, its incredible for a 13 year old. She's far superior to many recorded artists several times her age. She may have a bit to learn about Operatic Singing, but what she can do with her immature voice makes me very curious to see what she could do at 26. What were you doing at 13? I certainly couldn't do what she does. I'll buy all her CDs. If you know other kids with that kind of voice control, why don't we hear them?"
2,A disappointment,"Most of the arrangements in this CD sound as if she has been recorded at a distance; she sound awfully young and thin-voiced in the early cuts. I hear no passion and joy and joy in her singing, at least not on this first listen."
5,touched,"charlotte, an australian, at her age she is only in year 8! first year high school! but her sopprano voice is just un believable, she can sing such a high pitch, yet so tender and so sweet, there is no favourite song...i love them all! ...people out there who thinks classical music is dumb, listen to any one of her songs and it would change your mind, also...the more i listened to her song...the more i fall in love with them, her voice overwhelms my soul every time i listen to her songs"
5,The celebrity soprano,"Sopranos don't normally attain celebrity status for the simple fact that voices in that range are not much fun to listen to. It's an artificial sound -- a sustained ""falsetto"" that doesn't correspond to any human emotions except maybe ""eeek, a mouse!"" Charlotte Church is a bona fide celebrity who just happens to be a soprano. Listening to her voice I can easily tell why so many people prefer her to other singers: Unlike the mature sopranos there's not a trace of agony and anger in Charlotte's tone. It's all pure, pretty and pleasing. When I read through some of these reviews I noticed a display of anger in some of the more negative reviews. How curious that these negative reviewers almost universally prefer the singers whose voices convey anger (or what sounds like anger to the untrained ear) so easily. It must be hard for them to listen to a voice like Charlotte's that innocently celebrates the joy of life."
5,Awesome,I have never been an opera fan until I heard Charlotte Church. This album is a wonderful example of her great talent. Her voice is awesome and I recommend this to everyone. I was extremely satisfied with this album and I believe if you are a fan of great music you will enjoy this as much as I do.
1,Roger,"Zero stars for this one.CD's are all about sound and this CD's sound quality stinks. The music recording quality is some of the poorist that I've ever heard. It's particularly sad when a voice as great as Charlotte's, singing music as great as this, is so weak and muffled sounding. Even worse, much of her singing is drowned out by instrumentation.You only have to listen to her ""Voice of an Angel"" CD or her DVD to hear the way she should be recorded. Her DVD by the way, sounds so good that she seems to be live.Such a shame that this CD can be so bad. Definitely, don't waste your money on this one."
1,I am so sick of...,"I am so sick of people saying she's ""Heaven Sent"". she's just a normal girl! anyone can sing like her! well not anyone if you want an angels voice Try Jessica Simpson's ""Sweet Kisses"""
1,"from the ""CHOIRGIRL HOTEL""","This record just makes me so frustrated when i think of all the truly talented adolescent musicans at the world's top coservatories like Julliard Prep, who have more depth and artistry and can sing circles around this little turd"
4,Absolutely Wonderful!,"Although I am by no means an experienced music critic, I have immensely enjoyed this album by Charlotte Church. I find her voice truly amazing..so clear, so exact, and so beautiful. I cannot stop listening to the CD. I agree that it would be nice if a little more emotional depth were exhibited in the songs; at the same time, I believe this will come with her age and vocal maturity and can only try to wait until that time! Her technical ability is to me beyond words and is one of the main reasons I keep listening...to me, her timing, articulation, expression, and especially tone, sound (and feel) so 'perfect'--sometimes seemingly not of this world. Also, the songs seem appropriate to her vocal maturity and so seem 'authentic'. I feel the songs were well chosen--substantive, moving, challenging, and varied. I am completely captivated by Charlotte's strikingly beautiful and able voice and VERY MUCH look forward hearing more of Charlotte in the future! A truly gifted young talent!"
5,This was just lovely.,"I loved this recording. I especially loved the two Welsh songs, ""Guide Me Oh Thou Great Red eemer"" and ""Men of Harlech"". I think that if she keeps up with her training and she lets her voice mature properly, she will have a lovely instrument I believe that she sings with her heart, as all the Welsh do."
4,I love this CD!,"I love this CD. I had originally heard Charlotte Church on the TV movie Joan of Arc (I love that movie!). I fell in love with Panis Angelicus. I asked my mom to get me Voice of an Angel (so I could pay her back, of course), but she purchased Charlotte Church instead. I fell in love with it. My friends may think that I am crazy and listen to 'wierd' music, being I am only 15. I laugh at that. I hate pop music! They are the ones who don't listen to good music. I at least gave their kind of music a chance. This CD is perfect. So it is played switching places with my Edwin McCain and Motzart CDs. What a combonation of music! Charlotte Church has a beautiful voice, especially for one so young. I can only imagine how her voice will improve as she as well as I grow up! --Carol aka ""Lyra S."""
2,"voice is OK, just not for this kind of music","cannot agree more with the reviewers who said Ms. Church, while possessing a pretty voice (it certainly gets attention), should not be singing opera. Whatever Charlotte does in the future, and her life is literally still ahead of her, professional opera shouldn't be one of them. or if she really insists, she must come to grips with the reality that she won't make a great soprano. maybe she won't even be one when she finally grows up. her voice is good, but her singing technique, for the music, is flawed and is ruining her faster than she realizes."
1,Please SKIP this CD,"I am horrified when I think of how much money Charlotte Church is making off a CD like this when there are so many singers with one thousand times the talent. Church sings literature FAR too advanced for someone her age- and is slowly destroying her vocal chords. The Jewel Song from Faust is literature that no woman under twenty six should DARE tackle, not simply because of its difficulty, but because she could not POSSIBLY achieve the emotional depth the song requires(and she DID not, I might add- this is the poorest rendition of the song I've ever heard). Church is not musical in any sense of the word- she's merely hitting high notes. I implore listeners of music- listen to coluratura Sumi Jo, or a TRUE artist such as June Anderson, Kiri Te Kanawa, or some other such maginificent soprano, and SKIP Charlotte Church."
1,"Dear God, don't bother.","There is no such thing as ""child prodigy"" in singing. Voice are not ready to sing until a certain point in development. At Charlotte's age, all children who are going to have good voices when they grow up sound exactly like her. Just listen to the clips here at amazon of Jussi Bjoerling when he was ten years old. . . .Classical singers are not supposed to become famous during childhood. People like Charlotte are a mockery of what it means to train a singer. If this culture is seriously starting to like to listen to children who are not vocally developed, I can almost guarantee that Charlotte is going to have a lot of competition in the near future. I can think of five young women off the top of my head in my community who sing as well as she does!If you guys care at all about Charlotte's voice and want it to develop into a healthy instrument (which it no doubt will---she has talent), stop buying her CD's and encouraging this madness!"
2,Potential... Maybe?,"This is not a great CD. Charlotte Church has a nice voice, but she could use some intense training. She has a pleasant sound, indicative of real potential. Hopefully all the early attention won't kill a master singer before she gets to the meat of music.The CD is marked by alot of ameteurish mistakes. Sometimes she goes slightly off key, at times she is too loud or not loud enough. That she was very young when this CD was made makes these mistakes forgiveable. If you want to hear what raw talent sounds like this CD is for you, but if you only listen to the music I would skip Charlotte Church until she gets a voice trainer. She tends to sound like a so so pop artist."
3,Pushed too quickly,"I'm not a vocal expert, but it sure sounded to me as though Charlotte was pushing her voice beyond its range and ability. Frankly, I noticed it even on Voice of An Angel where she clearly didn't have the lung power to complete proper phrasing in some pieces. I've no doubt she'll make a great artist one day - if she's properly developed. But I found myself wringing my hands listening to this DC and wondering if she'd make those notes that are a challenge for even the best trained voices."
5,Delicious and Family-Healthy Snack! :),"Our family just loves this sweet, cinnamony, light and healthy pita chip!My husband will even eat them ! ! !What a perfect snack for late night hunger or to pack a sweet treat in those lunch boxes. Perfection! (And a great deal from Amazon!)"
3,They are okay.......nothing amazing.,The cinnamon sugar ones taste like a hard less-sugary churro. Kind of disappointing. I was hoping for a lot more cinnamon and sugar and I didn't get it. These chips are also very hard and a chore to eat.
1,"Not healthy, tasted like fried mislead.","I order pack of those when is onsales, it was very poor pack the bag almost fall out from the box. I read good review hope is good, i was wrong, i only able to eat 1 box out 3 box i brought, is just not good period, tasted below average, nothing too special, it does tasted like fry and very oily, very mislead. I think the contain is not correct is far higher. I rather eat chips than this !"
4,"Good and tasty, but did not stay fresh that long","I bought a case of these and my whole family enjoyed them. Very crunchy, with just the right amount of cinnamon sweetness. Since I bought a case, it took my family of three awhile to work through them, after about a month and a half, I found that the chips had gotten soft and stale. That was disappointing, especially since the expiration date was still a few months away.So, if you eat them fairly fast, I highly recommend this product, otherwise, buy a smaller amount."
5,Crack in a Sack!,"These things are so addictive they are sure to be banned so you might as well stock up now.Seriously, I never flip out over sweets and snacks and honestly I feel a little silly writing a review for Pita Chips but these things are flat out awesome and the best of the Stacy's brand in my opinion."
3,The title is well chosen.,A most interesting theme but far too complex and convoluted for my taste - but if any other reader finds it confusing then they should try the author's 'The Tin Drum'.
2,"Good Textbook, Limited Value Otherwise","This is a good textbook for teaching, and not as good of a source for research for real world application reference material, which is what I try to maintain a library to utilize. Very basic material coverage, good for students."
1,Inferior Quality,"For the amount of money I paid, I thought it would be a very good product. The material is not micro fiber. The material felt like cheap cotton. I ended up purchasing a micro fiber bonnet at Walmart for half the price! Do not purchase."
5,The best biography in wrestling history,"You see at the beggining how he was a football player then he changed his mind. Stone Cold talks about his career in wcw and how he got fired from WCW talks about the summerslam 97 accident and what had happened after the show and he Talks about his two daughters in england. This is the best wrestling biography ive ever seen.DVD Extras:-NWA & WCW World tag team champions the Hollywood Blondes (Austin & Brian Pillman) vs. Arn Anderson & Ric Flair in a 2 out of 3 falls match (Clash of the Champions XXIII)-Promos from ECW-Steve Austin vs. ECW Heavyweight Champion Mikey Whipwreck (ECW November to Remember)-WWE Debut match as Ringmaster & ""off-the-air"" footage-Family interviews & stories-Plus much more"
1,1 DVD is not enough!,"Im a huge Stone Cold fan and I have got to say that I am horribly dissapointed. This disc does not contain any of the good Stone Cold matches...specificlly the matches during the Austin/Mcmahon/Corporate Ministry era.Luckally, I rented this from Blockbuster. The main story is good but the rest I have seen in other DVDs. I was hoping for alot of matches. It would take atleast 4-6 DVD discs full of matches to really go deep into Austin's history. But 1 disc is pathetic. I put shame on the WWE as they have no idea what fans want.This DVD was not even worth the rent. I am a horribly horribly dissapointed Stone Cold fan and wonder how the WWE could put out trash such as this.I hope the WWE releases a 3-6 DVD set on Stone Cold otherwise I hope the WWE goes out of business as they are a horrible wrestling company now a days ever since they lost competion (WCW and ECW) and have no motivation to become better."
4,LOVe it,Very decorative my guest love the easy of charing their elec. I do n ot have to run around the house looking for USB ports. Love it
4,Absolutely beautiful voice,"Hard to believe Austrian soprano Maria Reining used to work in a bank before she made her debut at the relatively late age of 28. She has one of the most beautiful voices ever and her technique is flawless. This is a nice selection of arias that includes some arias that you wouldn't normally associate with her repertoire, Butterfly, Andrea Chenier and Boheme."
1,"Dirty, Dirty, Dirty","If you have pets, this is not the air purifier for you. I have had this air purifier for less than a year. It is filthy and I am not talking about the filter. The air intake chamber traps pet hair and dusted before it can even get into the filter. There is no easy way to clean this chamber, if there is any way at all. Then what does goes into the filter seems to go right through it because the blades on the fan above are covered in dust and there is no way to clean them either. Furthermore it is far from quiet. It makes as much sound as my window air conditioner. Moreover, the user manual says not to clean the filter with water, but when I contacted customer service, I was told that I should clean the filter with water and it will be okay. I am contacting kaz to find out how to clean these areas, but I have a feeling I will be in the market for a new air purifier after only one year of use. I am not pleased."
4,Pretty Good Air Purifier,"Overall, this air purifier has been pretty decent. I have a little cat and I do believe it does get most of her dander out of the air. It certainly gathers dust by the time I have to clean it! Cleaning it is pretty easy, it has a non-replacable filter which I just vacuum, although there is no real way that I can see to clean other areas of the apparatus, which I would like to do as they have gathered lint and the like (like the fan/propeller). The filter also runs pretty quietly, and really only interferes with the TV on the highest setting, and even then not that much. I would certainly recommend this buy (I got it for $99 + shipping)."
1,Nearly useless,The main reason that I bought this unit is because it has a permanent filter. It's advertised as being easy to clean. That's because it never gets dirty! The permanent filter doesn't pick up anything. It's supposed to give particles an electrical charge so that they'll stick to the filter but it doesn't seem to happen. Honeywell has discontinued this model (60001) and the smaller one (60000) and apparently has given up on the whole technology they use and gone back to units with replaceable filters.
3,its ok,this product makes so much ozone that i think it is for people that want to restore the hole in the ozone layer
2,"Good, But not quiet there yet!","I VERY MUCH ENJOYED THIS UNIT WHEN IT WAS NEW IT DID EVERYTHING THAT WAS STATED ON THE BOX.However, I now need to replace the IFD filter due to the accumulation of nicotene on it and can not find one anywhere. I purchased two units at once for around $450.00.If I had used them in a ""dust"" atmosphere they would still be great! Honeywell should have tested on Nicotene and smoke odors before touting the phrase permanent in reference to smoke and nicotene. I am sadly disappointed in a company, who over the years, I have purchased many of their products."
3,powder does not stay in filter,"I purchased this because I wanted a HEPA GRADE FILTER that I would not have tobuy replacement filters for but this is not really a HEPA grade filter. Powder will gofrom the intake and blow out the top w/o being filtered out very well. . .However it is a fairly good ionizer and removes dust that way. You have to dust more.It cleans the air fairly well in this respect and you get a good feeling when you first turnit on. However I could only give this from between 2 and 3 stars because it does not liveup to its specifications.Maybe after a good break-in period it will begin to remove more of the powder andsmall dust particles- I noticed the ""time to clean the filter"" status bar has started to workwhere before it said the filter is always clean.PROs: timer, powerful fan when needed (3 speeds) good ionizer, permanent filterat first removes a little of the feel bad things in the air.CONs: Not really a heap filter all dust not trapped in honeycomb filter design."
4,Good video,"There's a lot of trash out there if you're looking for a decent surf video; however, this one surprised me. Good soundtrack, editing, and interesting"
4,Surf,"Not the normal surf video.A great add to any surf library.There's a bit more Joel Tudor and long boarding than I needed but the film is about California history and what is California history without longboarding, so it works.I'm also not a huge Tom Curren fan BUT this is the best Tom Curren footage I've ever seen!!! Truly amazing! I suppose performances like this are why people rave about the former world champion - DVD is worth getting for this alone!Bottom line, the video just has a great relaxing feeling, punctuated with moments of on the edge of your chair footage that make me want to watch it again and again.Worth having for sure."
2,Typical surf film.,"Typical guy-centric surf film. It's a tough world to enter if you happen to be female, however, it was nice to see Tom Curren's little brother (and wife, albeit briefly) as a focal point during the film.Hey guys, it's okay to put a few female surfers in your films once in a while. Geez..."
2,"Should be called ""One Southern California Day""","As a NorCal surfer, I was disappointed. The vast majority of the movie is focused on southern California, with only about five minutes in the vicinity of Santa Cruz. Female surfers are largely ignored as well.This should have been called ""One SOUTHERN California Day with No Women in Sight""."
1,Innotek products are junk,"I have three collars that use this charger and all three were dead in just over a year. I wrote the company to see if they would do anything and never got a response back. The collars are sealed units, required to be weather proof, but it also means they are maintenance proof as well. I spent a lot of money to put an inground perimeter fence in and I'm very unhappy that the collars are such junk."
4,having a spare saves the day,"I travel a lot so I need to take a charger with me; on occasion, I've either forgotten it at my host's house or even misplaced it entirely. Having a extra charger helps me avoid the dreaded dead battery in my dog's training collar - now I can leave one charger in one outlet at all times.For the occasionally absent-minded pet-mom, this spare is an absolute essential."
3,Not very interesting...,"I bought this book wanted to learn a little bit about corporate espionage but didn't really find anything too intriguing about it.Penenberg gives examples of cases where espionage was used to extract information but doesn't go into a lot of details which would help the reader what was going on. In chapters 5 or 6 he tells the story about competing frozen pizza makers. He goes on to say how someone extracted some information from employees but never tells the reader how that information really could have been used. It would have been nice to include a extra few paragraphs explaining how the information obtained was actually used to benefit the ""client""."
3,Not a complete compendium but has reference uses,"By focusing on a single case (Avery Dennison/Four Pillars) the author then attempts to spiral out to other examples, many surface-only stories and ""anonymous"" source tales. There are many opinions and tactics in this field so reading one book will never be enough. One useful takeaway from this book is exactly what the focus of the main case is: glue. Not microchips, not missile systems, but glue. Interesting in the area of industrial espionage is what ends up being a target may surprise most people. Most people have no clue what ""complex fluids"", how deeply their lives are impacted by them daily, or how much money is spent developing them. Use this book as a case study or companion to other works but not as a main source of information about this field. Interesting but certainly not a training manual."
1,Almost Total Waste of Time and Money,"In spite of the promises on the back cover, flyleaf, and publisher, this book consists of nothing more than the story of one corporate espionage case, and a decidedly low-tech one at that. Sprinkled between chapters filled with excruciatingly repetitive and frankly boring details of the Avery espionage case, are several mildly interesting profiles of so-called corporate spooks, whose techniques range from ""oh, I can do all kinds of stuff, but it's so secret I can't tell you"" to ""I go to trade shows and ask people questions"" Reading the book, one gets the impression that the author may indeed have heard all kinds of cool stuff during his research, but none of it found its way into the pages of this book. This would've made a killer magazine article, but the book's just not there."
1,"Meandering, dull and avoids the point","Mr. Tanner's review sums it up well, along with others who have negatively reviewed this book. Sloppy editing, wandering writing style. One part of a chapter gets into a review of someone's life that has nothing to do with the book or espionage! To a large extent, we hear a surface review of a courtroom trial, but this book was supposed to be about espionage.Some mildly interesting discussions, but overall a waste of time."
1,as bland as the Browns logo,It's basically a coffee table book and a not very good one at that. I wanted so much more from a franchise that has some great history. This just came across as someone's jumbled list of what they thought were the significant moments in Cleveland Browns' history.And why 338? Why not 339? 336? I don't get the decision to pick that number. narrow it down to the top 100 and you'd have a great little book.
5,How Bad is the Bad Guy,"This is certainly not your typical Superhero comic. It takes a look at Superman's arch-nemesis and why he hates Superman so much. Lex Luthor comes across as being very intelligent man who is scared (or jealous, mayhaps?) of Superman and what he represents, and as a result takes actions that have a high cost. But do the ends truly justify the means?If you're looking for a good old action-packed Superhero comic, this isn't it, but if you dig complex villains, this is a good choice"
2,Not so good,"I was hoping for something better than Brian's last series with Jim Lee (Superman: For Tomorrow) but this turned out to be nearly as confusing as his earlier work. Brian has tried to something different (as with Superman in For Tomorrow) but I am not sure he succeeded. The end was kind of a let down and what happened with Bruce and Lex I've never understood... why was Supes fighting with Bats.Brian once again brings in his character Mr. Orr and tries to infuse him with some traits that should have made him more interesting but all I could think was ""He looks like Jim Gordon!"" so kinda distracting.The art is well... good but I guess it has to grow on you."
5,A Different Look at Superman,This story is mainly about Lex Luthor and his battle with Superman. It is very mature and shows a darker side to Superman. By reading this you understand why Lex hates Superman and at times you feel like Superman is the enemy. I really enjoyed this because it is really different and I like to see writers take chances with the characters we know and love. If you are a Superman fan or someone who likes a good villain then I defiantly would suggest to give this a try. Also it has some fantastic artwork!
5,Amazing.,"This is how Lex Luthor's character should always be written. The superb artwork captured Luthor's emotion (and at times lackthereof) and cynicism as well as ""The Alien's"" unbridled rage and seemingly diabolical nature."
2,Storyline Weakens As It Goes On,"This series starts promising -- the writing early on is exciting and powerful -- but as the storyline progresses the work fails to hold together. This is an interesting take, but far from perfect."
4,"Dark, interesting, complex. Like the villain himself.","Things are always interesting when seen from the villain's perspective but Lex Luthor has always been a complicated villain. He really thinks Superman is wrong for mankind and lacks the self-awareness to realize that he wishes he were a type of Superman or that his issues with Superman stem from any kind of jealousy. We see Lex here at his most human and inhumane all the while accusing Superman of lacking the very humanity that Lex truly lacks. Dark, interesting, complex. Like the villain himself.Bonus: Seeing the playboy side of Bruce Wayne have dinner with Lex!"
1,Macintosh Owners Beware!!,"After waiting for years to find a Mac compatible digital notepad that could capture text and graphics from classes, seminars, lectures, I was excited to purchase the Adesso CyberPad recently. However after failing to locate any of the provided software that would translate the .TOP files on a Mac, I wrote to the Adesso Help Line and was informed that this product only functions as a tablet for Macintosh monitors and does not have the text/graphics capture features I expected. Needless to say it has been returned. Don't make the same mistake I did."
3,ramp mats,"i put them on for safety, have not had to use them yet, thinking ahead. remember, i used a 2*8*8 board, order 6 mats, need to double the order. 6 per board, live and learn, had to order again. 6 per board =12 mats the way i put them on"
4,I loved it,"i loves the book ""From the Mountain Top"" because i have writin in it. It is a poetry book and published one of my poems in it and other people have writin in it and i loves it. i cant wait to by the book."
1,There is a special place in Perdition...,"...for the people who thought this was a good idea. I can see the meeting that spawned this awful idea: ""Hey, people like pop music, right? And they like hearing kids sing, right? So, why not put 'em together? It'll be great!"" And then God struck that entire meeting dead, but apparently not before they'd already sent out memos and kicked this horrifying experience into motion.I mean, Outkast? I love Outkast. I still love ""Hey Ya!"" even though it's been overplayed. It's a great, happy, up song. It's also about sex, and you know what? I don't need to hear a bunch of kids singing ""Don't want to meet your daddy/just want you in my caddy."" I don't *want* to hear kids sing that.You know what the real travesty is? It's that this is the *sixth* CD in the series. Let's hope God's a little quicker on the trigger when someone thinks about cutting a seventh one of these things."
1,WARNING: NOT SUNG BY ACTUAL ARTISTS!,"For those people that have seen the commericials and think that these KIDZ BOP albums are real compilations of songs like the NOW CD's, they are not. This album contains clean versions of hit songs sung by a group known as the KIDZ BOP KIDZ. Don't be fooled! Then again, this CD might be good for parents who like to censor their children. As for me, it sucks."
2,I Don't Get It,"I don't get Kidz Bop. What kid wants to hear other kids sing their favorite songs? You may as well just ask one of your friends to sing to you. And please, whoever makes Kidz Bop, Kidz Bop CDs are bad enough with untalented kids singing back-up, but must you randomly get some even less talented person to do the main singing? I might rather listen to William Hung! Most kids like songs because of who sings them, so why do you think we'll waste our money on your screwy CDs when we can just go buy Clay Aiken's CD to hear HIM sing ""Invisible"", and Michelle Branch's CD to hear HER sing ""Are You Happy Now?""? WHY?! IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!Advice to readers: Buy Radio Disney CDs instead. They're clean, and ACTUALLY HAVE THE REAL SINGERS SINGING!!"
1,Why are These CD'S In stores???????????!!!!!!!!,"I saw this CD on TV and I thought it was cute, until I heard these little kids sing. It was horrid! I recommend Now or Totally hits, not this. Oh, and guess what? ANOTHER DUMB CD IS COMING OUT IN LATE AUGUST!!!!!!! ''I can't wait!'' Yes I can, I can wait until they go outta business!"
3,Let me say it this way,"I have to say that from listening to this CD, it would honestly be nothing more than a novelty to us adults. To the children who listen to this, it is more than likely a lot of fun! It would make great birthday party music for the children (under 9). The lyrics are cleaned up and it is better to have your children singing this instead of harsher lyrics to the songs that they are growing up around. However, this would probably get hidden on family road trips. I admit, as a 22 year old, some of this is funny, but the white guy rapping to ""Hey Ya"" is reminiscent of some hellified karaoke..."
1,the living hell on a cd,"what th f**k is this, its hard to believe they made more than 10 albums even though they suck. In the 9 one, for all u green day fans, they made a version of wake me up when september ends which sucks. Kids dont like it so who keeps buying them!?Kids from Kidz Bop, u know what u all suck. Shut up and go back to school."
1,I think this is great!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ok, If you loved the first 4 Kids Bop CDs as much as me, then this one you'll really hate! It has the great songs that can't seem to get off the radio performed by no-named preteens.1. Crazy in Love negative 5/102. Hey Ya! negative 1/103. Are You Happy Now? 1/10 (hey Branch is hot)4. Invisible negative 10/10 (wtf is this)5. It's My Life (I'm pretty sure this song is by No Doubt) negative 100/10I'm done wasting my time giving them ratings, cause they all suck. Do me a favor and click the back button for even thinking about buying this. Go and type in Brand New - Deja Entendu for some good music for you and your kids to enjoy, trust me."
1,.....ouch!...,"WOW, I never even heard the cd, alll I saw was the commercials...like the one for the Kidz Bop Movie...OUCH!...i feel sorry for those kids, so i made all you peoples an album thats called Kidz Bop Sucks! it contains many songs from System of the Down and NapoleonI cant wait to send it to ppl(...)i hate KIdz Bop, and i give it -100 stars!o, and kids, plz dont listen to Napoleon if u like your sanity...lol Dream ON!"
1,thou .....,"thou yeasty, milk-livered, knotty-pated, sheep-biting, onion-eyed, beef-witted, cockered, dankish, dissembling, errant, fawning, elf-skinned, earth-vexing, full-gorged, fustilarian, nut-hook."
1,this album is tacky and i hate it,"this album is a waste of good plastic. i hate it and it sucks. id rather poop a box of thumb-tacks than to listen to this dookie. no, id rather put my own dookie in my ear. no, no, id rather let chris himself poopoo in my ear than to listen to his music."
3,Keep up the good HARD work,I think you are a great representative for the alternative lifestyle... even if you stay mostly in the closet. Keep up your good hard work... if you know what I mean.
4,It's a good light but a bit expensive.,"I bought this about a year ago and I am still using it. It give you enough light but you need to come up of a way to clamp this on a stand for you to position it. But, overall. . . it is a good lighting for photography."
4,Guinness World Records 2003,"Okay, when I first got this it had a wrinkle on the cover. Also, it was covered in this goo. It was packaged in a white bag filled with this dust like stuff. But after getting all that off, it was fine. It was an okay Guinness book, though I like 2010 better."
3,less than thrilled,"As competent as this book's author may be the quality of print REALLY lets it down. I find the font bold but blurry and it makes reading the book arduous. I was also hoping for a broader range of writing genres as this book, which is aiming to inspire, had one flick through and is now consigned to the pile of seldom used resources."
3,"""Antarctic Polar Bear Relocation to Begin on Earth Day""","Like wolves most bear species are endangered.The reason is that they are a very smart predator species.Relocation to Antartica has been the idea of some conservationists.Since penguins seem to also be having trouble, it may just make that problem worse?This book is a sort of book I dislike: a ""denaturing"" of nature.Making nature seem drawing room nice when it isn't.For a long time the biggest threat to Polar bears was extinction at the hands of man as a hunter? The California golden bear is extinct from hunting. So a book telling about how man is trying to help the bearin these terms is pretty near lying to young people?Sometimes good intentions are not what science needs?"
5,"Great series, great dvd","I love watching Red vs Blue and if you ask yourself if it's worth buying on DVD, the answer is YES. It's loaded with tons of extras that ARE NOT shown on the internet, plus it's cool to watch on your television. BUY THIS"
2,Red vs. Blue Season 3,"Although the first volume was great, and the second was okay, this just became a chore to watch. There are a few funny moments, but for the most part, it was slow and repetitive."
1,Other reviews bot written,This is absolute garbage that I am shocked that I in a way paid for thru amazon prime this is just worthless dont get this stuff
2,A poor Version of No-LImit Poker,The game was not what I expected there were no graphics in todaysmarket there should be more graphics and anamated players. This game does not make me want to play it. If I could return it and get my money I would.
5,Awesome electronica,"Eat Static, science of the Gods is a brilliantly made CD and is a must have for all you hardcore techno fans. I love the title track most of all. It's a powerful mix of jungle and trance."
3,Nice try but no cigar,I gonna be honest; I was dissapointed by this album. It's not bad at all but there seems to be a void in the emotion department. The tracks where hurrying to get nowhere fast like a runner on a treadmill. I do think you should try it. It's just not my cup of tea and I really wanted it to be.
2,Unexciting and dull,"I got this at Tower because i had money to spend and i liked the cover. When i listened to it the first thing i thought was ""I wish i had my $15 back"". What a dull album. This is exactly what techno shouldnt be. Uninspired, generic drums and beats, flat samples, and a general lack of energy. There is one decent hook on the whole album that grabs your attention. I forget which song and i aint poppin it in to find it cause the cd is too boring to wait through it."
4,The master at work....,"Goju is one of my foundational styles with Kyokushinkai. This is an opportunity for you to see the master at work. Excellent form and execution a must have. Now you can compare your form to the highest authority today. But like everyone else I have problems in finding exactly what I want when I want it. It would also be nice if it had multiple angles but that would make this way to long. It shows all 12 katas of Goju. This DVD was probably a reproduction of a video tape and hopefully in the future they will update thier efforts.However, don't let that detract from you watching this DVD, you don't have to be a Goju stylist to enjoy this video. This is a historical video in that you get to see the highest authority in Goju today when he was still working his way up."
4,Video on DVD,Wonderfull to see Higaonna. A pitty that nothing is done with the new medium DVD. There are no chapters. Just have to find the katas in the old fasion way by scrolling for- en backwards.
4,Coffee Table Book,"This is a great book for the coffee table. It has lots of beautiful color pictures with a brief history of the artist and the piece in the photo but if you are looking for ideas with detailed information on how to color metal using mediums other than paint, don't waste your time or money."
2,Color on Metal: 50 Aftists Share Insights and Techniques,"I love everything that Tim McCreight has written. However, I wish I had read this title more thoroughly. I am a beginner in metal and was looking for a book to give me recipes for Patinas. This did not. It may help me later on after I have developed more skills."
5,IF YOU LIKE UNSOLVED MYSTERIES..........,"STEPHEN MICHAUD AND HUGH AYNESWORTH TAKE A LOOK AT 50 MURDERS WHERE THERE IS EITHER A FUGITIVE AT LARGE OR THE KILLER IS UNKNOWN.THE WRITING STYLE BY THESE TWO PROS IS ALWAYS ENTERTAINING,AND AVOIDS THE CLINICAL STYLE USED IN ''TRUE DETECTIVE'' TYPE MAGAZINES. ALSO,THE CASES HEREIN ARE ALL OBSCURE,SO IT WILL BE NEW TO MOST READERS[BUT,THE CRIMES COVERED HERE ARE JUST AS SHOCKING AS MORE WELL KNOWN CRIMES,INCLUDING THAT OF MICHAUD & AYNESWORTH'S PREVIOUS NON-FICTION SUBJECT,TED BUNDY].THE BEST CASES ARE THE FIRST,''SUSPECT'',ABOUT A DOUBLE HOMICIDE IN COLORADO, AND ''THE FROG GIGGER'',INTERESTING BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE MURDER WEAPON USED.THIS BOOK WAS FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1991,AMONGST A GLUT OF SIMILAR TITLES CASHING IN ON THE ''AMERICAS MOST WANTED/UNSOLVED MYSTERIES'' T.V. SHOW'S SUCCESS,BUT THIS ONE IS THE BEST I'VE READ."
5,HITCHCOCK'S REVIEW,I like this book becouse it gives the young and the old new poets a chance to let other people around world to see their poems. That and I am partly parshal with the book because one of my poems is in it. (and I'm only 17).
2,Not what is pictured,"I typed in REAR brake rotor, a clear picture of a rear rotor pulled up ( you can tell by the casting for the parking brake) I ordered the rear rotor pair...I received a pair of front rotors.. They are very high quality rotors...only order if you want a front set.."
3,Child classic,"I loved this book as a child. Neat pictures and creepy. But as an adult I think it might be a bit too scary for the little ones. Wait until they are at least 11. The last page is hard to explain to your child as well, so don't even bother turning to it."
1,Run Forrest Run!!!!!,"Stay away from this product. The Quality and design is poor. The battery compartment is a real pain. I don't think I have ever gotten more than 5 minutes worth of continuous play. This is because the RF on the controller or the console keeps going out. (You can tell if either is actually working by the red led on each respective piece.) In short, a very frustrating experience. Save your money and your sanity, and either check out a Logitech or get an extension cable."
4,Compact and convenient,"The controller has great range and can point in any direction while working, but have a few AAA batteries on hand."
1,Very bad wireless controller,"The start and select buttons are too close to the analog sticks, and they have no outward depth. The battery part on this controller is the worst I've ever seen. It takes three AAA's and they are very hard to put in correctly.overtime the cheap door that cases the batteries will eventuallt fall off and your batteries will not stay in place without it. So, basically your controller becomes useless."
4,Great little Mouse,"I bought this mouse for my MacBook Pro because I have the larger brother to this one. I loved it and then my son conned me out of it and has been using it for gaming on his system. It works great for him as mine does for me. I did have a bit of an issue with the size myself but his hands are smaller it works great.BTW - I have been a Razer gamer until I found the bigger version of this one. This is much better to me.Anyone with small hands or wants a small gaming mouse for a laptop, this is it."
1,Candy,"I would not recommend this product! This is the second time I've purchased this here BOTH times they were stale and hard !!!! They are suppose to be chewy and soft. Mine were hard, porous,"
2,Not chewy - the were hard (old and stale),"These arrived and were not chewy as described- they were hard and dry. I tried several packs and every one was dry. Taste was fine, just not the described texture - they were not as hard as regular ones but in no way chewy. Seemed not to be fresh."
2,STALE,Ordinarily Wonka Giant Chewy SweeTarts are my favorite candy. I was impressed by the fast shipping and delivery by Amazon.com but was immediately disappointed because the candy was stale. I signed up for automatic reshipment but I might cancel because I don't know whether they'll send me the same stale product I received this time. I'd rather pay higher prices and get fresh product from someone else.
4,Yummy,"If you are a fan of sweettarts then you will love this. Even thought they say they are soft, they are actually quite hard. You have to suck on them for a bit before they soften up."
2,NOT SO CHEWY - Giant Chewy Sweetarts,"So I remember these candies from when I was a kid and have found them here and there and always pick up a pack when I do. Other reviews state that ""this is how I've always found them in teh last five years"" but I know for a fact I've gotten them from a store within teh last couple of eyars and they are nothing like the look, feel and texture of the package I received in teh mail. I give it 2 stars because of prompt delivery and the taste is still fine, but they certainly are not what I was expecting or hoping for. I brought the majority of them to work to give away because these did not fulfill the nastolgia I had hoped for."
2,Sweet tarts,The product seemed old and hard. The only way we are eating it is to microwaving it for a bit.
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with DVD, considering the high price and how long I waited for It. I knew It was a short video, but as far as the perfomance scenes were concerned not one song was complete and thru the years I've seen other performances that were not included. The picture quality is awful, sound is too. It's a view once video and that's about it. Then to top things of, my favorite song, which is listed on the back, isn't even on the video."
5,Fantastic! Super easy.,"I love NuSphere. NuSphere MySQL was a snap to install. I was able to host a web page pretty much right at the start (after I got used to the directory structure and some of the features).This was perfect for a beginner like me. Perl, apache, php and mysql work right from the start. This setup is perfect for learning Web Development and administration. I've wanted to learn Apache and php for a while, and NuSphere definitely kicks you right into it. The nice thing is you don't even need to be connected to the net to start learning. This package comes with pocket reference guides to Perl, apache, and php. Plus the big book on MySQL.A good knowledge of Linux/Unix and command lines well is needed."
2,Mouse Basics,"I have been keeping mice for a year now and have become a breeder in my local area. I brought this book thinking that there would be more information in it. It only touches on most of the subjects it includes. I found that it makes a very good starter book, but it is sadly lacking in depth of content. It looks like it has a lot of information because of the number of pages, but each page is very small and contains little information. There are lots of good pictures to enjoy though. I would recommend this book to someone just starting out, but I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to know more than the basics about mice."
5,The most underrated album of the year.,"Pretty Ricky's 'Bluestars' is the most underrated R&B; album of the year. People compare these guys to B2K and groups like that, but people should be comparing those groups to Pretty Ricky! B2K ain't got nuthin' on these guys. Their music styles are in no way similar as Pretty Ricky combine Hip-Hop/R&B; and Soul altogether unlike B2K which is a mix of Pop/R&B.;This album is outstanding. My favorite songs are ""Grind With Me"", ""Your Body"", ""Get A Little Closer"", ""Call Me"" & ""Girlfriend"". Buy this album if you are serious about your R&B;."
5,Pretty Ricky gets on my d@mn nerves!,I hate Pretty Ricky.They think they can sing but they cant.And besides all the girls like them based on looks rather than talent but people like Michael Jackson based on talent rather than looks.Do you get my drift(Dont judge a book by its cover and in this case dont judge Pretty Ricky based on looks).
1,I guess sumthins wrong w/ me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"First of all, Pleasure, although sexy, cannot sing! The lyrics on this CD when the other 3 are rapping are ridiculous!!! I cannot believe that so many people are saying this CD is good. Is this really what we've come to accept as good music! I sware I'm about 2 go make a CD!!! Y'all should love that 2. SAD!!!!!!!"
5,Fire,"Ahhhhhh watch out Pretty Ricky coming through. These guys are xxx-tra sexy and I would grind on any one of them at any given time! This album is on fire and would put you in the mood for ANYTHING! (if you know what I mean, lol)"
1,These Guys CAN NOT RAP!!!!!!!!!,"The only good thing about this CD is the background music. The beats are dope but the lyrics are garbage. For example, in the song ""I Want You"" there is a verse that says ""You had me fallin like some leaves in the summer. You had me fixing things like I was a plumber..."" Leaves don't fall in the summer, and do I really need to comment on the ""plumber"" part of the verse? ""You and me get down like 2 flats on the side of the street"" is another crappy lyric from the same song. The worst part about it is the beats and the actual singing in the songs is pretty good but the dude kills it with the raps. The first single ""Grind On Me"" is alright and probably the best song on the album.The only people who would really enjoy this album would be young middle school and high school girls who are boy crazy because I have to admit these boys are easy on the eyes...but that's about it."
2,THIS ALBUM NEED WORK,"I'm not a kid but anyway, It's only three good songs on this album. If it wasn't for the singer, I don't think no one would be interested in this group. Pre-school raps about sex is all this album offers OH YEAH, with a good hook. If that's what you into buy this album but personally, It's not, at all worth it. I wasted my money and I don't want you to do the same. I suggest you get something that's going to last for years to come not a album that's going to be played out at the end of this year. I recommend you purchased Marques Houston's NAKED because this is a great album, vocally and topic wise it makes you feel something unlike this Pretty Ricky album.P.S. Something is fishy about these reviews too, seems kind of suspect."
1,What is this crap???,"why are there the 5 stars. ok thats it, ive had it, if you like Pretty Ricky, Omarion, B2k, Lil Bow Wow, and your a guy who LISTENS to RAP MUSIC, then you know what, you just as equivalent to a fruit cake who would be listening to Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, 98 Degrees. your listening to BOY BAND MUSIC PEOPLE!!!! WHAT EVER HAPPEN TO ONLY BEING HARD AND HARDCORE!!!!!!?????????"
1,ABC...123 Music,"The songs on here are so funny. Grown ass men talking about playing house sleeping with underage girls (Nothing but a number) what else? Grindin, Humpin, Bumpin and cloths burnin and everything else little 13 year old boys think about. This album is an embarrassment. Everything on here is equally bad, so their isn't anything worst then the other. You pretty much get the samething with each song. Pretty Ricky is probably the worst group I have ever heard. This album is a mix between Vanilla Ice rhymes and R. Kelly leftovers."
1,best serves a beer coaster,"Another bubble-gum industry product that will be gone in a year or so. Don't waste your time with crap like this. If you want to listen to some heart felt inspiring music, buy an Anthony Hamilton or John Legend CD."
1,I Give This (Sugar Honey Ice Tea) no stars,"This is the worst group and the worst album i have every heard in my life. and i only heard snippets. They should have never recived a record deal. Someone at Atlantic is like one of there uncles, please let it be that. because they are WHACK!!!!!!!!! ENuff Said"
5,this be ashley,"well i think that the album was good and that they all are great artist. ""Grind with me"" was the hottest to come out and i love it and i also loveeeeeeee ""your body"". but i think that its a pretty good group and that they all should keep up the excellent work. but when i first heard about yall i thought it was one person by the name to find out it was 4 of i thought well this is better. but i think its the hottest album i ever heard and also the sexiest and hottest group well thats it fo me peace."
5,Downloaded fast,I love this album. This is the 2nd time I purchased this album. My CD wouldn't work anymore so I thought I'd try downloading this time instead of getting the actual CD.
4,Hataz Need 2 Catch Up with Their Kind!,"I though this was gonna sound real bubble gum, but no way, it was the real deal. For 20 year olds they really laid down tracks that can make you wet and having your momma ask who they are. Songs like ""Grind With Me"", ""Get A Lil Closer"", ""Juicy""... are the freak songs that can get you in the mood. ""Shorty Be Mine"", ""Get You Right"", and ""Call Me"" were songs that expressed how to make a girl be yours in a drop of a dime. The cheeiest songs on the album had to be ""Grill'em"", ""Chevy"", and ""Girlfriend"". Other than that the album get 4 stars! A good debut!"
2,Decent but Crap at the same time.,"While I did actually like ""Grind on Me"" for a few days, I downloaded the cd when it came out - sorry. I bootlegged. It wasn't worth my money nor do I own a cd player (thats so old-fashioned). I saw the video and at first thought they were cute but then when I saw them on tv at the VMA's (?), they looked like trash.You need some form of birth control to listen to their songs. I guess if your into hearing about sex, sex, sex, and more sex then this is the cd for you. If one liners like ""I'mma eat ya body out like lunch"", and ""I'll be your mexican lover bangin' up your pinyata"" interest you..then hey! Buy it. It mostly appeals to... people between the ages of 12-15 though.......but if you have a little more taste.. pick up Omarion's or Marques Houston's, hell even Ray-J's cd."
1,Stupid,I don't get this group at all. All they do is talk about bags of chips. I don't get it. Maybe you should bang your head with a bag of chips...maybe that will help.
1,"Dont believe these ""reviewers""",They are probably fakes that were either hired to street team for the label or its the same person over and over again. To be fair this cd isnt horrible but its way below average. I heard this cd in a friends car. It sounds like a mixture between HTown and Bone....but in a bad way. They rap and sing but they dont do either particularly well. They need to find one thing and do it well. Its kind of lame to try to rap like your hard and then harmonize like Backstreet Boyz. This cd has a couple of songs with nice beats and thats it. I would give it 1 and a half stars if I could. The best song is the single Grind with Me (which aint that good to begin with)
1,fake ass crap,"Hey, what's this with all these 5 star reviews. This cd is crap. I sampled this at the music store and these guys suck. They have just given me reason to hate blue which happens to be my favorite color. They all look a little queer on the cover of this trash too. These mini Twista wannabes can't decide if they are singing Rand B or rapping. what is this? I know ladies are fine and all and nothing beats making love to your woman but I can't seriously put this on to get my girl in the mood. This is sucky crap with no substance. These guys are one hit wonders with their ole gringdin song and don't believe the hype. They seem to me to be the B2K of 2005 and y'all know hat happened to that boy group. History just might repeat itself here. Go get some Usher, Jagged Edge or one of the greats like Barry White or Luther. This is nonsensical."
4,Great Debut,"Ok, surprisingly, I actually like this cd!! I didn't even think that I would, but someone burned it for me, and I was not disappointed. This was a great debut from the fellas. I can actually listen to the whole thing. They're very comical too! Pick up the cd!"
5,GET PRETTY RICKY: BLUESTARS NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Whoever says Pretty Ricky (as a group) doesn't have talent, they obviously have no taste in music. From the get-go this CD is hot with all kinds of songs ranging from the popular ""Grind On Me"" to sexy singles like ""Get A Little Closer"" and ""Get You Right"" to just great hip-hop songs like ""Chevy"" and ""Grill 'Em"". Pretty Ricky is defiantly up there with other R&B groups like Dru Hill, 112 and Boyz II Men. But then you have the rap part of the group which is 75% of the group (since there is only one R&B Singer) which doesn't rank up to Tupac or Biggie, but they're still good. The Miami based group consists of 4 truley talented guys, Pleasure (The Sexy R&B Singer), Baby Blue (The Smart Lyrical Rapper), Spectacular (The Romantic Rapper) and Slik 'Em (The Crazy All Out Rapper). If you want a great album with R&B and Rap on one CD, GO GET PRETTTTTTTTTTY RICCCCCCCCCCKY NOWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,YA THEY CANT RAP BUT,"IM ALL RAP TYPE N I THOUGHT THESE GUYS WERE LAME BUT THE CD IS TIGHT I LISTEN TO IT TO GRIND WIT THE LADIES ITS NOT THat bad YOU WILL LIKE IT THEY CANT RAP WORTH NOTHIN BUT THE BEATS ARE TIGHT CHORUS IS HOTNUBERS 2, 6, 14 ARE MY FAVORITES"
4,Good Book,If you love Gettysburg you will like this book. I have been there myself 6 times and this book was very interesting to me. You get a look at Gettysburg and what it looked like at the time of the battle along side of a picture of the modern day.Well done !
4,The Supercommandos,"A supurb read, well researched and detailed enough to send me off in search of more historical records and literature regarding persons, units and operations described. The illustrations are excellent and the sections relating the First Special Service Force operations in Italy and in particular the Anzio beachhead and on the way to Rome are indicative of how the Force operated outside conventional infantry doctrine. General Frederick was a great soldier and a true pioneer of unconventional warfare. Well done to the Author."
5,Best book ever,I was very skeptical when deciding to read this book because I was intimidated on the thickness of it. Once I started there was no stopping my crazed thirst to finish the book. There is so much detail and knowledge in the surroundings and the characters it's like you're part of the book. I would definitely reccommend it to anyone.
2,Not very enlightening,Very involved concepts discussed by experts. This is a textbook for advanced students. I just wanted more information on the Sun while using my small H-alpha telescope. Too deep for me!
3,"Great Idea, but new gernation takes the cake.","I had this on my GMC 3500 for the Rancho 9000 series, and loved the idea, but I had to set it every time I drove. The system did not hold pressure! Then the supplied air line broke! I have to strapped securely, but the acutal air line was not strong enough for the mid west weather. It only lasted a year! Don't get air controller stuff! Go motor controlled!!!! But again, love the idea, and the rancho 9000 series shocks ROCK!"
4,"So far, so good...","I am over 50 and have had mild to modeterate (mostly mild) eczema most of my life. This past year, my eczema stayed at the moderate to severe level. I have been miserable! For the first time in my life, it is on my face, especially around my eyes. I have been using Dr. Christophers Itch Ointment for approximately 1 month and I can actually see some improvement, defnitely some relief. The change is gradual but it seems to be working. I have tried many ""eczema products"" including prescriptions, over the counter and home rememdies but nothing seemed to help. So far, so good..."
2,too firm to be useful,"I thought this would be like a salve. It is so firm, it can't be rubbed out of the jar. It is like wax, and when scrubbing it firmly with your finger, you get a slight film of it on your fingertip, so not easy to apply. I honestly am so annoyed with how hard it is to apply, I haven't used it more than once, so can't tell you if it works."
3,Lovely but Fragile,"The plates/bowls/cups are all nice looking but I have a few issues: (1) food sticks to the plates pretty easily - like if you have anything sticky on it like rice or gnocchi, it's hard to wash it off; (2) it's kind of fragile - they break pretty easily (especially compared to Corning/Corelle which never breaks); and (3) the ergonomics on the cup is bad. It's hard to hold the cup without it tilting to the left side (if you're a righty). It's hard to hold the cup without having your 3rd, 4th, and 5th fingers touch the cup, which is unpleasant when you're drinking hot coffee."
4,a good goofy little book,If you find this book you will pick up lots of tricks. Once you get over the cheesy objects that they choose to illustrate as demonstrations...you will see excellent model making methods. If you make models or work with plaster...you will want to get this book. I was laughing half of the time and the other half I was taking notes. I think these authors really have skill...Buy their book if you can find it. Only complaint is aesthetic..I wish they had a stylist and bigger budget for a more comprehensive book.
3,Enjoyable for Kiddies,"My daughter with autism is obsessed with all things Mr. Toad. This works for her, keeps her happy and when she's happy, I'm happy."
1,"FALSE, FALSE, FALSE","Do not waste your money and time reading this esoteric type of writing. She contradicts the gospels. If you take some time and test this writings against the Holy Scriptures, they will fail the test. Her only purpose was to keep you away from trusting the one and only Savior. Put your faith in Jesus Christ only, He is the new covenant. Ellen G. White is a CHARLATAN!!"
1,it does what??????,"I was trying to figure out this toy for my 4 year old son (it was a birthday gift) and I thought I was losing my mind!!!! I kept looking at the directions and trying to figure out exactly what it does...the answer was not much.... What fun is it to have the car pull itself up on a pulley (very slowly)? It reminded me of toys I used to have when you would pull a string and it would make the toy talk (except it doesn't talk, maybe that would have made it more exciting)anyway I think it was a waste, my son will probably have more fun with the car inside that he can just push around on the floor....."
3,Loosen up with a valium Duncan,"The story has a modern twist on a mail order bride. Maddie takes the risk and finds herself in a ranch with a sexy but surly cowboy. She keeps at it until they get it straight. LH has a nice touch with an old tale and a modern gal.My main hesitation is Duncan himself. He was so closed and judgemental, even if he had a great bod, I didn't quite catch the attraction. He snipes at her when they meet about her shirt being too short. The day after their wedding he comes home and snipes that supper's not ready- not bothering to find out that she'd been busy working in the house the whole day, and then when Maddie saves his *** financially, he really lashes into her, driving her from the house. As interesting and feisty as Maddie is, he's just not my type of hero. Sorry to rain cow dung on this rodeo.............."
4,Love it!,"This book is a hard book to find, but I'm glad I did! This is vintage Howard. Possesive alpha male, entertaining, hot, quick little story. If you are a fan of Linda Howard, check it out. If you aren't a fan of her yet, check it out- you won't be dissapointed! She's an esquisite story teller. You are guaranteed alpha male to the max, hotness, and a damn good story. What I especially liked about the story was that the heroine stood up for herself without being an annoying pain in the a**. The book I have was a Sillohette published in 1990, and it's OLD, that's the cover I have. Oh, and I just have to mention that even though it's written in 1990, it's not too dated for a contemporary. The story of Madelyn's brother is told in Loving Evangeline, which I'll eventually check out. I'm slowly working... no savoring... my way through all of her books."
3,Not What I Expected,"There are enough reviews to give you an indepth idea what the book is about I'll comment on the fact that I pictured it a bit more upbeat. I hate waiting till the very last possible minute to get any resolution. I felt the h was so verbally beat up at times because the hero compared her so much to his Ex. I even shed a few tears on her behalf, I found myself very irritated wanting to whack some sense into the hero. Why anyone would put up with these circumstances is beyond me but overall it was an entertaining book that I basically enjoyed and can recommend with the exceptions I pointed out above. Enjoy"
1,Abusive hero,"I felt the hero was no 'hero' at all. He was abusive and controlling - even to the point where he didn't want her having keys to the car so that she couldn't leave the house when he wasn't around. I found it hard to believe that someone could fall in love with him.This is the kind of guy that women run from - as fast as they can. I was horrified that a character like him could be the 'hero' in a romance. It really made me re-think buying Howard's books. Sure, in the end he was all sweet and loving. But what happens the next time he gets angry?A character like Duncan would be more suited to the villain in a murder mystery."
4,"Great romance, a pleasure to read and a keeper","I love this book and have kept it since it first came out. A nice play with the mail order bride, embittered Reese just wants a wife, but Maddie is more than he bargained for. It's wonderfully sensual and it also has an emotional core. I believed in these characters and believed in their love. So it's a keeper and a reread for me. Vintage, excellent Howard."
5,A Startling Romance,"One of the best things about Linda Howard is that she never stops surprising me. Madeline, the heroine of ""Duncan's Bride"", was a woman who did not give in to weakness or hysterics like most romance novel heroines would have in her dealings with Reese. Howard showed the real effort that is needed to make a marriage work out. Reese's need for emotional distance and Madeline's determination to reach him despite his efforts were dealt with in a way that made the story very real. The book did not make me all starry eyed and I did not hear Disney theme songs in my head as I turned the pages. I did, however, come to respect both protagonists for their strengths. It was a very well written book that came as close to being realistic as a romance novel can get. I am definately going to read it again."
2,Not as other books of NMS series!,"After reading NMS surgery , i really trusted NMS series as review book for boards and end of clinical rotation exam. During my pediatrics rotaion i bought NMS pediatrics and start to notice the differences between the books of this series. But when i read NMS Medicine, i felt like reading newspaper about medicine! it is very boring and dry. It is not usfull (at all!!) for your medicine rotation since it doesn't give you management plan. The heamatolgy and neurology chapters are the worse, but i should say that it contains good respiratory diseases chapter. At the beginning of each chapter, there is introduction about history taking and clinical examination, which i used to skip when i satart to read any chapter! because it is wasting of time, it does not inculde the important points. For board review i suggest you to search for another book!What i understand after i read this book is that the author is very talkative and boring!!"
2,"Too much information, no prioritization","As any medical student who is gettting their tuition's worth knows, half of the battle (if not most of it) is knowing what the best first-step is in approaching a patient's problem. This NMS book provides list after list of information about just about every topic in internal medicine, but does little to clarify what information is most appropriate. For example, in approaching a patient with an apparent GI ulcer, the book lists out all the diagnostic options without prioritizing them. Knowing what the best first-step is (or best next-step, as the case may be) is the key to providing rationale medical care - and to answering shelf exam questions. This book provides way too much info without much guidance as to how to use it. Not good for medical students in need of experience-based guidance. The cardiology section is good, however, (each chapter has a different author) so consider borrowing a friend's copy to cover that chapter if possible."
5,#1 Med Text,"I love this book. I used it in my second year for pathophys and used it again during third year. The book is very concise and easy to read. I went throught his book about a total of four times leading up to my exam and aced it. THe earlier you start using it, 2nd year, the better off you'll be."
1,where is the list of song titles for this album,"ethel waters is a wonderful blues, jazz, and spiritual vocalist whose singing has stirred the hearts of people all over the world. BUT WHY IS THERE NOT A LIST OF SONG TITLES FOR THIS ALBUM?????"
4,A fascinating and tragic story,"I deducted one star for the main theme of the book being difficult to find - that being the feud between Drs. DeBakey and Cooley.Otherwise, it is a very interesting tale of the early days of open-heart and transplant surgery. The procedure itself was almost abandoned after its disaster-ridden debut in the late 1960s, but the high death rate was probably because, like with any new medical procedure, the practitioners really didn't know what they were doing. Unlike most other medical breakthroughs, these doctors were in the world spotlight, as were many of their patients.My brother and his wife once lived in Houston, and I described some things in the book to them. They said not much has changed in all these years.Both physicians are still living and practicing, Cooley in his 80s and DeBakey in his 90s although neither do surgery any more."
4,Great for parties,"This is great and easy to navigate. The intro is a little difficult to judge, but still a great DVD!"
3,works pretty well,"Nice lens but just like other reviews, I have to agree that it is difficult to keep the lens steady for a good picture. Also, the AF (auto-focus) feature of the camera does not work with this lens. One additional point, be sure to unlock the shutter release in the menu because otherwise the camera won't recognize the lens and will not release the shutter."
2,Lens almost impossible to clearly focus,"I purchased this lens for my A350 hoping it would be at least something to get me by until knew what lens I really wanted.I would not pay any price again for a lens by this manufacturer.98% of the photos are blurry even thought they look fine in the viewfinder or LED display. By the time you get them in focus or think you have them in focus, if the subject is not stationary, the shot has been lost...Spend a little extra money and buy another brand.Betty Ebel"
5,Hawai'ian language,"The book made it easy to understand the pronunciations of each word. With the excersizes that written in it, made it better to understand how to speak a new language. Especially one as complicated as this one. Even though it doesn't cover the entire language, it still gives an excellent start for a simple conversation. I liked it."
3,Wish the CDs stood alone,"In general I liked this book/CD combo. But the way it's set up, you really need to be using the book along with the CDs, a bummer for me since I like to listen to the CDs during my commute but can't drive and read at the same time! Other lanuage CD's I've used in the past can be used independently of the book, and I like that a lot better."
3,Nice to have the workbook,This is okay at best. It's nice to have the book along with the CD's but the program is only so-so. If you like a little different style to switch up to from something else you might enjoy this.
5,Learn Hawaiian at Home,The book arrived in extremely great shape; very quickly; and has been most beneficial. I am very pleased!!!! The description of the product was detailed enough to allow me the knowledge to know it was the book I wanted.
2,Warning: Brazilian DVD,This is a Brazilian DVD edition of the 1992 VHT home video. DVDs from Brazil are not manufactured with the same quality standards as in the US. My advice: wait for the made-in-the-US edition.
3,Not as good as expected,"Not one of the best Rod's live performances. A simple stage, just Rod, two backup singers and the band.This band didn't rehearse at all, Kevin Savigar and Jim Cregan where were you?Rod forgets some of the lyrics, he looks tired. At least video and sound quality are really good."
2,"Aptly titled -- chaos, indeed","Boy, I really wanted to like it much more than I did. Novels about Hollywood which feature actual personalities are rarely successful, no matter how much insider knowledge is involved. I found that I couldn't finish it, even though I had less than 50 pages left to go. Life is too short."
5,"Funny, wicked look at pre WWII Hollywood","A really human portrait of mixing the personal and the political in the name of artistic endeavors, I found this book to be a wonderful read about Hollywood in its heyday. In the same way the author was unafraid to take on the Holocaust and protray it in the language of human survival for King of the Jews, Epstein is also unafraid to be both funny and frightening in this novel."
2,In agreement with the first review.,"I just purchased this book. And kicked myself when I got home for not reading it more thoroughly first.The toys are attractive, and there is a diverse range of toys. However, the plans for all the toys are NOT included, it DOES feel like a catalog, and the plans that ARE there, are incomplete. They just show the exploded view, and the dimensions. There are no details on how to actually construct the toy. The process of putting all the pieces together is left up to you.Which is fine for a moderately skilled toy-maker such as myself, but a novice would definitley have trouble.All-in-all, was very disappointed in this book."
1,Making Timeless Toys in Wood,"As others have said already, this is more a catalogue of toy plans than anything else, and the few plans they do include are incomplete. As such, it is completely useless. Do not waste your money."
2,From bad to worse,"Nas is one of the best MC's. In fact, he is one of the prolific MC's out there. But the album, it sucks. It seems like every album he is getting worse. The production is not weak and he is not as hard hitting. I understand you can't be like the first album but this is ridiculous.I am was horrible and this album is wack too. I think it is the production. Nas need more better production. I think his new album should have Primo and Dame Grease. Trackmasters should do one track. Someone please save the Nas because his albums need life support."
2,Almost Lost A Fan,"In retrospect, this album is O.K. But at the time it came out, it might of been the worst CD I ever heard with such high expectations. At this time, two of my favorite MC's (Nas and Jay-Z) had completely lost their minds and direction with this music sh**. I loved his first two albums, but ""I Am"" in my opinion was too much of a mixed bag of songs and then this! Honestly, Nas might as well of had a cheerleader outfit on yelling ""Go Ginuwine Go"" on the second single. Thankfully, hot guest spots on The Wu and Capone-N-Noreaga helped restore some of my faith in him. By now, you know Nas has come full circle and is on top of his game again. But at the time, I almost stopped being a Nas fan. Thank you Jay-Z for bringing Nasty Nas back."
1,Is this really Nas?,"This isn't a very hard album to write a review on, it could be summed up very simply. Listen to ILLmatic, then listen to this. It's hard to believe that both albums have been done by the same person. Nas almost perfectly epitomizes what's wrong with hip hop. When he first came out, he was called the next Rakim, with one of the best flows I've ever heard and an extremely nice lyricist. But now, he's the ""iced-out thug"", just like every other commercial artist. It's a sad thing, because he does have the talent to be one of the best. For some reason, he doesn't want to use that talent."
1,Nas............ what happened man?,"I'm not filling this one at all. It's maybe one or two tracks that's worth the effort of searching for, but the rest are commercialized and wack. I still give him the respect of being a pioneer of his style and one of the greatest lyricist. Maybe he used the tracks that didn't make the ""I am"" CD. It was a supprise to see him release 2 CD's 5 months apart.I'm hurt Nas!oNe"
2,who is NAS kidding,"this album is the wrost nas ever. it was rushed, put out in 6 months. the single sounds like will smith. the first half is better than the second half. Nas ain't so nasty on this album"
1,Trash,"First let me begin by saying that nas is a poet and he's words are the truth and im a huge fan of this nugga but nastradamus ? Was awfull even wid some good production he still had wack songs and lirycs... Almost ruin his career and his cred as a street mc wid songs like you owe me?Sounds like somethin 50 cent would do or some commercial rapper but not the nas i kno and apreciate as an true mc...Well for good nas albums ? get illmatic, it was writtin, lost tapes and even stillmatic. But his other albums are all garbage.Still nas can pretty much destroy these new up & coming ""rappers"" any day when he wants too."
5,Not Best But Better Than Others,"OK, this definitley wasn't one of Nas's greater albums, as a matter a fact it was his worst. But I think everyone can agree when I say though it wasn't his best it's still better than most of these stuff the rappers come out with now. Rappers like Yung Joc, Paull Wall, Mike Jones, Lil foneo and all the rest of those little corny rappers."
4,TO SAY THIS IS HIS WORST IS KIDDING UR SELF DUNN,"TO ME WHAT KILLED THIS CD IS ""BIG GIRL"" & ""YOU OWE ME"" I CAN BUMP THE OTHER TRACKS BUT TO BE HONEST IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE NAS. WHAT ALLOT OF FANS TEND TO FORGET IS HOW HEAVILY BOOTLEGGED ""I AM...."" & ""NASTRADAMUS"" WAS SO YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT TAKES AWAY FROM THE QUALITY,ANY THING TO DO WITH THE LP. TO BE HONEST IT'S BETTER THAN MAJORITY OF THE FAN BASE CONSIDERS, I THINK"
3,Nastradamus,"It is definately his weakest album. Most reviews disslike It was written and I am.. so they say Nas has fell off. I disagree. This was just one of his bad albums like Jay-Zs dissapointing Life and Times V.1. It happens. Nas is still the king and stillmatic combines his lyrical skills with great beats. back to the subject, Nastradamus is a weak CD with a good DJ Premier track and some havoc produces tracks. It is a dissapointment but a Nas fan should get it and see what they think"
3,The King Is Coming Back. L.E.S.,"From ""Illmatic"" 2 ""It was written"" 2 ""I'am"" nas been keepin' it gangta.In ""Nastradamus"" nas kind of sliped but when ""Stillmatic"" come out every body going to fell it. The Real King Of New York IS Coming Back."
4,Nas hits the nail on the head,"This album is not Nas's earlier works at all, but its still a tight one. Nas's sound has got more poppier than his old NY gangsta roots he established with 'Illmatic' ('Nastradamus', 'You Owe Me') but he still manages to come through with some of those old street tales ('Family' f/Mobb Deep, 'Quiet Niggas'). 'Shoot 'em Up' is a very impressive track and is easily a contender for best song on the album. My favourites are 'God Love Us', 'Come Get Me', 'Life We Chose', 'Shoot 'em Up' and his interesting turn on 'Some Of Us Have Angels'. it was interesting to see the other side of Nas as this album is basically a forefront to the millenium/apocalypse in his own words. There you have it, Nas's latest CD, 'Nastradamus'. Not really any bad tracks (perhaps except 'Project Windows', way too slow and a whacked-out beat) and actually a very good CD, it will not at all dissappoint you dedicated Nas fans out there, no matter what you've been told. Cop It Now!!!"
4,I Am Is Better,"I'd say this song has some dope tracks, but I Am was wayyyy better. Still I'd check this one out, but if it's a choice, get I Am. Peace."
4,ESCOBAR Part 2,"The new alblum by Nas is a for real fans. Nas does not hide behind guest appearances by other rappers to boost interest, nor does he stray away from the topics that got him to the status he is currently in in the industry. I feel Nas has put together an alblum for the fans who have grown with him. This alblum shows versitility, wit, and has appeal for everyone who loves hip hop. Every artist has a time where the material becomes repetitive and cliche but, Nas always seems to set new trends and add new flavor.Don't sleep hip hop heads, ""cause sleep is the cousin of death."" V dogg"
4,It's OK,"This album is Ok, it's better than Written, equal with I Am, no where near as good as Illmatic. He should stick with D.J. Primier, they make a good team (Come Get Me, NY State Of Mind 2, Nas Is Like, I Gave You Power,NY State Of Mind1,Memory Lane,represent). You Owe Me, Project Windows, Nastradamus all suck. The average tracks are New World, Quiet N's. The rest are good. there is only 1 gem, Shoot em' up."
5,nastradamus album is blazin',"nastradamus album is hot from begining to end but my favourite cut on the album is come get me, new world, you owe me featuring ginuwine and family featuring mobb deep but the album has incredible beats and the album is banging for real."
3,Nastradamus Needs To Go Back To Nasty Nas,"Nastradamus is the wackest album to date from the man known as Nas. Nas needs to forget about all these nicknames he calls himself and just concentrate on dropping rhymes. Illmatic is probably one of the all time great rap albums, because Nas had that killer instinct and that desire to be one of the best M.C.s. Now, he is getting ridiculous, Nastradamus has some good joints like COME GET ME, FAMILY (featuring Mobb Deep), and SHOOT EM UP. Those three cuts shows Nas has extreme lyrical skills,but he needs to take his time and he will be able to put together another classic. Me just many others put Nas in the same category as Biggie, Pac, and Jigga but Nas' last two albums have been poor and he belongs nowhere in that category with those emcees so, do us all a favor Nas and go back to Nasty Nas, because your rap career is starting to go down the drain!"
3,"Good, But his most dissapoiting album ( 3.5)","After nas released the classic ""I am"" I was very excited to see what Nas would come out with, while it's not on the level of ""i am"" and some songs seems half thought out, but there are a number of songs that really show why Nas has some inredible skill as an artist and a rapper, "" come and get me"" is one of Nas's best songs and the equally soild "" life we chose"" and ""shoot'em up"", this album is worth your money if you're a fan of nas and hip-hopProduction: beats 8/10..... lyrics 9/10Favorite songs: life we chose, come and get me."
4,Too Much Hating...,"Ok, Nastradamus was I would Say Nas's Worst Album, BUT again I'm not saying it's bad album, because of Nas's Ability he can do much better, Nas is my favorite rapper and I would say the greatest along wiht Pac And Big, I consider them the three kings or greats of rap. Nastradamus is a pretty good album, a little above average, but lyrically still good, but hey its Nas, common now. Some beats come off whack but they lyrics can still rock your mind, should you pick it up, if your a hip hop lover and more into the more jumpy Rap, get it, Nas fan, get it, but if you like that thug poet rap, you might not like it, but please ppl, dont hate and appreciate him enetrtaining us."
3,This Would've Been Good Has This Been His 1st Album,"Nas, oh Nas, why won't you change...? 'Illmatic' got everyone's attention, and 'It Was Written' kept it long enough for us to notice that Nas can write one of the best songs in 90's rap ('I Gave You Power') and some of the most mediocre songs. By the time 'I Am...' arrived, Nas became another rap machine, and this is not meant as a compliment. Song after song is put out, some good, some not.If you're willing to pay the full price for an album, and then hit the skip button on your CD player after every other song, then go ahead. Nas's new album isn't a necessity, but worse things could be bought.Some of my favorites: the energetic 'Come Get Up' (track 6), 'Shoot Em Up' (track 7), 'Last Words' (track 8), and the Mobb Deep collaboration 'Family' (which seems to be themed similarly to Mobb's remix with DMX of 'Quiet Storm')."
5,Nastradamus is a good album,"This takes a lot of crap because it's from the same artist that made Illmatic, the greatest rap CD ever made. Nastradamus is still a great album and Nas still brings the dopest rhymes the genre has ever seen. If you're a Nas fan, this is a must have, and if you listen to Dipset, or any other wannabe rap out there, then even Nastradamus will sound like a classic. Even Nas's worst album deserves a 5 because its still a great CD."
3,Not his best work but,"Don't believe everything you hear about this album. I think this LP is tight. I'm not saying that Nastradamus is his best album, but it has the same classic Nas from any of his 3 previous albums. It's hard to make a classic album, It's even harder to make four. There are a couple weak songs on this CD so that's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5. Songs like Some Of Us Have Angels, Big Girl, and You Owe me, ruin the album. But Nas makes up for those songs in Life We Chose, Come Get Me (Diss to Cormega), and Family f/ Mobb Deep. Over all this album should not be missed, if you like Nas. He is just doing what every rapper does, fall off, but Nas didn't completely fall off in this album. He still has some of his good qualities he had in his previous three albums."
2,Is this really a Nas album??!!,"I mean this cant be the same Nas that introduced the greatest hip-hop album of all time(Illmatic). This album is nothing like his previous 3 albums. I guess every artist has to slump sometime, and this was nas's time. Do yourself a favor and dont purchase this album because your gonna ask yourself the same question i did. Your better off picking up Illmatic or It Was Written."
2,It hurts to hear.,"Positive: Nas is a great rapper who usually has pretty tight lyrics. There were some pretty good tracks on his last attempt: I am. There are 5 tracks on this record that I find worthy of listening to. ""Quiet Ni**as"" is my favorite track cause it's something I agree with Nas about. A few songs have good rapping but nothing else.Negative: Beats sometimes lacking. Choruses seriously lacking. ""Life We Chose"" sounds like Nas isn't quite with the beat. ""Nastradamus"" is so ""Made-For-MTV"" that's it hurts. It surprises me how pretty good rappers continue to try to attract Backstreet Boy fans by ""selling out"". The track ""Big Girl"" is so bad/comical it could be on Adam Sandler's next CD. The beat for ""New World"" is another comical experience for the true hip-hop fan. I heard he made this 7 months after ""I am"". He should have waited a little longer. The bad by far outweighs the good on this album and Nas has older albums that top this with only the intro."
2,nastra...DAMN,"Nas is sharp lyrist- along with Gza, killah Priest, and 9thPrince of Killarmy to name a few, but lacks in the way he chooses hisproduction. Basically, Primo is good but chops up his music using heavy drums and his trademark scratches, which makes his music sound the same. And Timbaland's music is really R&B, very simplistic skippy beats which also sounds the same which is apparent on ""You owe me"". It sounds like that beat he did for Missy Elloit. And Dame Grease, this is not a DMX album it's a Nas album. Nas and Havoc work good together. My prediction for a great Nas cd productionwise is RZA, Havoc, L.E.S., and Primo. But stay away from the Wackmasters, and then we have another classic. Lyrically, Nas wasn't complex on this one either. Like on Cuban Linx's ""Verbal intercourse"", he displays the Nasty in Nas. But here, maybe 1 or 2 standouts lyrically. Let's hope he can recapture his flame?"
5,He looks so good!,Yo I think Nas look so good! And his raps are off the meter. If I had ONE DAY WITH HIM HE WOULD NEVER WANT TO LEAVE ME. That is my Husband!
2,ok,didnt care for this one has to be the worst one to me. only a few tracks i was feeling. but i say get it anyway
1,Worst Nas album out there,"I for one, think Nas is probably the best rapper. PERIOD. This is the only album of his I dont recommend you own. Illmatic, Iam, Gods Son, Lost Tapes, Stillmatic. Those are all excellent CDs. This CD is total garbage though. Shoot em up is alright, but nothing special, just some thumpin bass though. Nastradamus the title cut is so played out it aint even tight... And those are the best three! The rest is [bad]. Those three arent even songs I ever listen to. This aint representative of Nas at all, trust me, his other CDs are worlds better, and I aint gonna recommend this just because I am a huge Nas fan."
1,dont waste your money kids,"Im not going to bother explaining why this cd is so bad, but if you were tempted to buy it Warning: DONT. Get Illmatic, and maybe Stillmatic and It Was Written, which are both fine, but not as good as Illmatic. If you've already got those 3, then instead of buying this one, get 4,5,6 by Kool G Rap. Very similar to Illmatic in style, and Nas guests on one of the tracks."
2,The Lp that nearly killed Nas~,"This Lp is surely Nas's worst lp, dont get me wrong but im not hating! Nas is an extrodanary Mc no doubt, but this seems to have been his attempt to keep up with the times, and compete with the ""Jiggy"" Rap that was filtering the waves back then. The only good thing that came froim this lp is it made him realize that ni@@az loved his style n they wasn't havin no jiggy Bullsh!+. He is who he is, n thats one of the most inovative,creative, and realest cats to ever grace the hiphop seen. His work speaks for himself, but this was truly his worst effort. Luckely my man Nasir step his game up, n regained his top spot uptop of the hiphop world. Only nas fanatics and music colletors need buy, but any other thing with nas's name on it is worth your 16.99. so forget this one and n pick up that new $h!t! One.....Oh and F all u internet geeks, who crownd u hiphop elites! leave the art to the mcs, Keep it real~"
1,From Nasy Nas to Escotrash to Nastragarbage,"Nas just went commercial on this weak piece of trash. It was sad to see a Pure top of the game MC turn into garbage. Nasty Nas was the Nas we do and still respect; Escobar was his 50%Ill, 50%hollywood form that was so-so. Nastradamus is his P Diddy clone that made him pure garbage, and I'm glad he wasn't Nastradamus or Escobar on Stillmatic, or I wouldn't buy that one either. Well this album is a shame, and a 100% discrace to hip hop. I guess when Jay-Z told the truth about him, I guess Nas did what we wanted him to do, go back to his Ill skills and battle back. Anyway, do not get this, cuz Nas changed his flow, and out all his energy to good waste."
3,WHERE IZ DA TIGHT NAS,"I can't say much about the album but I am iz way better than nastradamous. Even though I had second thoughts about buying the album because he worked on the album for 7 MONTHS ONLY unlike I am which he worked on for about a year and a half. The best tracks on the album were family with mobb deep, last words with nashawn and millenium thug, and shoot'em all. If you liked the album It Was Written then this album iz for you."
2,A Lackluster Effort,"I give Nas two obligatory stars simply because he is Nas. . . Other than that this album fails to show any evolution in the artist's development or hip hop. I bought strictly on the belief that the first single ""Nastradamus"" was a foreshadowing of the other potential hits. Was I mistaken! Except for the Isley collaboration, the album is downright painful to listen to. Wack beats paired to trite lyrics. For an MC who wishes to be compared to the greatest rappers of all time like Rakim, KRS, JayZ, and Biggie this is a POOR effort which mandated that I call my fellow collectors and STRONGLY advise that they do not buy it and either purchase the Method Man/Redman project or wait for Q-Tip's release next week. The only saving grace is that my local music store has a policy whereby on Tuesdays I can return Nastradamus and Aaron Hall's ""Inside of You"" (don't get me started with that one) for something worth listening to."
1,AWWWW MAN... This RECORD is WZA-WZA-WAAAACK!!!!,"DAMN DOG. WHY DID YOU HAVE TO GO AND DO IT? I TRIED TO SUPPORT MY MAN, NAS BY GOING OUT AND BUYING THIS ALBUM, AND THE SUCKA PAYS ME BACK WITH AN EARFUL OF WAAAACKNESS! WHY DID YOU DO IT NAS? AFTER ILLIMATIC, NAS SLIPPED. AND I'VE BEEN PATIENT WAITING FOR ANOTHER CLASSIC. BUT NO! I REALIZE THAT HE'LL NEVER COME BACK AND DO IT AGAIN. WACK! WACK! WACK!LISTEN READER, IT'S LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW HOW NAS USE TA BE ON THE CONSCIOUS TIP. WELL YOU SEEN THAT VIDEO WITH GINUWHINY AND ALL THAT SELL OUT BOOTY SHAKIN? THAT'S WHAT NAS IS ABOUT NOW. STUPID, MAINSTREAM, POP BULL."
5,Nas cant be touched,"Nas is the best rap artist ever.This album just proves it. It has strong beats, and hot lyrics. I hope he has some more tracks for us. Queens is representing this year."
3,"""The Forgotten One""","Okay, this album would probably be the last best album in the NaS collection. On this album, he gets more, let's say ""religious"" with songs like ""Some of Us Have Angels"" or ""God Love Us"". My favorite song would have to be ""Project Windows"". It's still good though so go get it :|"
3,Hit and miss with Nas,"Most people seemed to be dissappointed with this album. I dare not say it is close to his best, but you can't call Nastradamus weak. Sure his slant has got more pop influenced over the years (check the title track) but the man would know how to make good hip hop in his sleep. 'You Owe Me' is whack. Infact it's probably the worst Nas track I've heard, with it's half-assed rhymes and awful commercial hook. But that is only one bad track in an otherwise great album. The best tracks are 'Shoot Em Up', 'Come Get Me', 'Last Words' and 'God Love Us'. 'Family' is another gangsta track with Nas's fellow qb partners-in-rhyme, Mobb Deep and the Bravehearts almost actually rap on 'Quiet Niggas'. Overall, this is a good album, but you'd be better off buying Stillmatic. Nas is still the best"
2,nasty nas to what?,"aiight... illmatic was the best rap cd put out... ever. there is no way to continue to put out tracks like dat, cause maybe we all expect too much from nas now. however, he has taken tha sell out path and promotes to white kids who dont know n e thing about music, rather than the infamous QBC. a bunch of rappers now days r doing this however, like mobb deep, etc. this album isn't even worth purchace if u r a true nas fan... if u want raw, real qbc beats... look up some mobb deep infamous, or CNN, and especially cormega. real is real"
4,NAS IS DA BEST!,NAS ESCO IS THE BEST RAPPER OF ALL TIME...TO ME HE WAS BETTER THAN BIGGIE...AND HE'S BETTER THAN JAY-Z...THIS IS MY DOGG...HE'S A TOTAL POET..HE BRINGS REALISM TO HIP-HOP..ALL OF HIS PROJECTS WERE TIGHT FROM DAY ONE..WATCH OUT JAY-Z FANS!
4,He's Da Real Hot Boy....,"I truly enjoyed this album as I did all the others. In a couple of words...I just love him. I'm one of his biggest fans and his likeness is on my wall. My favorite song is ""You Owe Me"", the beat, hook and lyrics are off the heezy, although he could of got me to sing da hook. Nas keep on keeping on and don't worry about the haters, they just wanna be down."
1,Not the Nas I used to like,"Nas' latest opus is very disappointing to the ears. Don't get me wrong, Nas is a great MC, but on this album he showed lack of skill he once posesed on the first two albums. Nas must take it back to the streets with the next album, because you can hear his sytle for the worst."
4,Nasty Nas,"NAS: i agree that his earlier albums have been good, but this CD is one that grows on you. You have to play it through a few times before the songs are in your head. keep em coming.. I'll buy em!"
2,yo you should have kept nastra......who in yo closet kid.,yo no doubt nas got skillz but he sould have kept this one to his self. i got all of your cds but this one i will probaly give away. except for a couple of tracks its wack.
3,Not as good as his last disc,"Though Nas can clearly still rap, Nastradamus fell short of my expectations. The songs, while not terrible, do not stand out much, most just come out flat, and the same old apocolyptic theme gets old fast. The featured track, Nastradamus, is definitely nothing special. Only worth the money for the really hardcore Nas fans. Everyone else should just buy something different."
1,The worst hip-hop album of 1999 - where did Nas go wrong?,I'm a big Nas but what happened. I feel horrible saying this but it is the worst album of 1999. I am i felt was not up to par either. It was written was lyrically a good album but the beats were wack. The beats for I am were excellent but the lyrics were bad. No both beats and lyrics are terrible. Songs such as some of us have angels and the bravehearts track are horrible. New World and The life we chose are the best songs on the album but even songs like dr knockboot on the I am album are better. Nas has to do alot better if he wants to survive in the next few years
2,Nas 's worst work.,"Just ignore this album. Forget it. Don't waste your money like I did. This CD is worthless. This is the problem when artists drop 2 albuns in the same year. It happened with DMX...Jay- Z (C'mon an unplugged?. This CD is wack, at that time Nas was lost, he was still in that Nas Escobar s**t..."
2,"Yes, Its True- The Downward Spiral Continues....","Nas has grown from a boy coming out of Queensbrdige to rap fame. His has respect from all sides of this bissness, when he drops an album, since Illmatic it gets respect.This album is terrible! It has no sense of style, nothing that his past cds illustrated. No great songs, Kill Em All, stand out; barely. If youre a big fan of Nas buy this, but I'll warn you, it might depress you, its truly terrible. If you just want to hear true greatness get your hands on Illmatic- What the critics say is true and more- Its amazing. This album is so far below any quality standards he has. Its almost as bad as Puff Daddy, PE2000- thats a terrible album- this marks the continued commericialization of this artist and of the industry.Its commerical, its terrible. So be warned, its almost disgusting. Read what the fan said above this- Its all true; it doesnt have to be repeated."
4,The weakest album by Nas,Nas is the greatest rapper of all time but this is weak this made me mad when i first heard it all Nas albums are classics but this one only get 4 stars this is weak I don't even know why he brougth this out this weak and okay at the same time Nas is the greatest but this was the down fall ov his career.
2,nas?the man who made illmatic?u gotta be kidding me,"this album was all bad.not the nas we know and love.this was just poorly done.i was expecting this though because of the first single he dropped,""nastradamus""2 words: wack single.this is one of the worst songs on the album.but nas did have some highlights such as shoot'em up and u owe me,shoot'em up iz clearly the best song on the album by far. now i am only 13 so mistake me if i am incorrect but this is my opinion"
2,This is NAS worst yet...,"This is crap. NAS is wanting loot for himself. I am insulted I ever bought this garbage. If you liked Illmatic, you'll hate this. NAS is targeting the rich suburbs with this album. It aint working"
3,"NOT NAS BEST....EVEN I HAVE TO ADMIT,I LIKED THIS BETTER THAN JAY-Z..DYNASTY","THIS PROBLEY WOULD HAVE BEEN NAS DOWN FALL TO SOME,BECAUSE I...HAVE HAD SOME PEOPLE THAT I KNEW BACK THEN WHO DID NOT LIKE THIS!!!...BUT I LIKED A FEW SONG'S...THATS ABOUT IT.YOU CANT GO BY WHAT PEOPLE SAY,ALL THA TIME!!!"
3,A real snoozer.......,"Ever since It was Written was released and Nasty Nas became Esco, people said that Nas lost something. So what does he do? He tries to combine the style of Illmatic with I Am together and the results? OK. Sure this album is decent but the 3 times I have listened to it I have fallen asleep. When Nas released Stillmatic he stoped caring about his image and just spit like he did with Illmatic, I am, and It was Written, it turned out sucessful. This album is a speed bump in this poet's prolific career."
2,Weak this time around,"I really enjoyed Nas' previous album, ""I Am"", but I found myself bored & having to press the skip button with ""Nastradomus"". A few tracks are alright, but overall its weak. The beats are lacking & the lyrics don't really make up for the weak production. Nas is still an ill mc...but I wouldn't recommend this CD. If you're new to Nas, buy his earlier CDs to get a picture of what this mc is all about."
2,Who is this... Nas or some COMMERCIALISED G?,"Basically, Nas ain't street. This is a brother who would RATHER RAP about dollars, cars, girls and watches than his roots and NY State of Mind. Illmatic, which has never left my CD Player since 94', was just amazing. Words can't express how good it was. I definately say GO AND BUY Illmatic and LEAVE THIS POOR EXCUSE FOR A CD TO COLLECT DUST IN SOMEONE ELSE'S ROOM.Peace."
3,its an ok cd sum good songs,this cd is alright it has sum good songs like Come get me and nastradamus. Big Girl is 1 of the worst names to name a song its sounds like Nas is a pedafile.. but meh its all good. this not 1 of nas's hot cds. if u dont have illmatic get it.
1,What the hell?!,This is the worst and hopefully the last whack Nas album;lucky for him he redeemed himself on Stllmatic.
2,By far Nas' worst album,"As I said in my I Am review, I'm a huge Nas fan, but I'm a realistic fan: This was definitely the lowpoint of his career.It's hard to hear Nas try to be something that he isn't. That's what he tried to do on this album. Most of the album was fillers, with a few pretty good songs. Nas' lyrics aren't bad, but on most of the songs he's very braggadocio and I don't enjoy the message he conveys.My favorite tracks: 1. Project Windows 2. Some of Us Have Angels 3. New WorldThose were really the only songs I liked."
3,Nastradamas the rebirth,"Not a big hit. Tracks I like are ""Life We Chose"", ""Family"", Nastradamas"", ""Come Get Me"". Anything by Nas is guaranteed decent though"
2,not information about swatch warranty,"Very fast delivery, nice watch, but I'd liked to know, clear information about factory warranty in Amazon's site or seller's site. All Swatch users know that swatch products have two years warranty. My new Swatch doesn't have warranty card filled by seller, because they are unauthorized dealer for swatch, and it has only one year warranty with seller (watchzone) and not with Swatch. Product information doesn't mention anything about they are not Swatch authorized dealer. There is no way to know this important information before purchase.Now I can't return it, because seller's return policy it's very strong, I must pay shipping costs, insure the watch and pay a restocking fee of $10.95. I used my watch immediately and the watch can only be returned, if it has NEVER been worn. I'm praying nothing happen to my watch in the next two years."
2,Agradable,"No fue lo que yo esperaba, la caja del reloj luce demasiado pequeña, tiene detalles color naranja cuyo tono no es tan fuerte para dar un buen contraste sobre el fondo negro del reloj."
3,Incra,"Incra makes some of the best precision woodworking equipment on the market. This Shop Stop, however, had a problem with the threading that holds it securely to the fence. I'm waiting on replacement. Mistakes happen and Amazon and Incra handle them."
4,sphinx,this was a very good book. it started out in oldern egypt and then the scene became modern egypt. i learned a lot about egypt and it was very suspensfull. i didn't like the antagonistic part about the book but it was still a very good book. i would recommend it to anyone that is intrested in egypt.
4,Still writes great books,"Some have commented that he is losing his ""touch"" but I still really enjoy his books. This one is not his best by any means, but is still a good read."
5,Excellent book will keep you glued!!,"This book is great!!It's the first Robin Cook book I've ever read and since reading it, I've read just about all of them.Excellent story that makes you want to see a movie based on it (I know they made one a while back but I've never found it).One extremely minor complaint is related to the main character. She's drawn up with as a very intelligient person with a degree from an ivy league school but she makes some very dumb decisions... but I've noticed most of Robin's characters' do this. I'm guessing he does this based on human nature's 'heat of the moment' type bad decision making so I'm considering it not a factor to diminish the book's level of enjoyment.If you're looking for excellent books, you can't go wrong with Robin Cook, I would rate all his books five stars for real without hesitation!!"
1,Don't bother,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. Robin Cook is a great author, but only when it comes to medical thrillers. His little escapade into writing about history and the pyramids of Egypt left me wondering why he ever decided to write about something he knew nothing about. The characters were shallow and typical, the dialogue was a bunch of useless bantering and the plot was predicatable. From the reviews I had read I was expecting a well written piece and from the books I've read I trusted Robin Cook knew what he was doing, but this was not the case. All I learned was that Robin Cook needs to stick to his medical thrillers, and nothing else"
4,It's nice to see Robin Cook out of the hospital,Whether or not you are a fan of Cook's medical thrillers you will enjoy this lively adventure of a researcher in Egypt who uncovers a centuries old secret.
5,Very Good Read,"This being the first book of Robin Cook's that I've read, I was very impressed. Although I understand that he does a lot of medical dramas, Sphinx was a truly excellent read.While others complain about the protagonist, I thought Erica wasn't that bad. Although at times it seemed Cook forced the whole Richard-Yvon-Erica thing a little too much, side-tracking from the story.All in all, it's a good book. However, for those that have read it.......do you not think that the name of the book does not really relate to story at all? Perhaps when I was reading the end late one night I missed something important, but why 'Sphinx' as the title? Oh well, just curious."
5,Refreshing change for Robin Cook - please write more like this,"It was quite a while ago I read this book. But I wanted to put a review in.I love Robin Cooks writing style, and find his books difficult to put down. But I get frustrated at reading the same story again and again. Mysterious symptons/deaths eventually lead to the discovery that an unethical corporation is carrying out sinister experiments/activities all to enrich themselves or their shareholders. No doubt he has been instructed by his publishers that the formula works and not to change a winning formula. That was why it was nice to read an original story by the Author. I really hope he is able to break out and write some more original content like this - or even to stick to the medical thriller but with an original storyline.Anyway, 5 stars for a great book from a great author."
1,"Weak, weak, weak..","I do not understand ow anyone could give this a decent review.I just finished the book last night and I must say that the entire storyline is weak. The heroine is an insult to women everywhere; she is ditsy, easily manipiulated, taken advantage of sexually by every male she meets... I could go on and on. The main problem though is that she would have been dead after the first few hours if this plot had any credulity to it. In fact, I knew the book would be a tired plot as soon as she witnesses a gruesom murder and does nothing to report it, but rather goes back to her hotel room to take a bath - PLEASE.Do not waste your time & money - move on to something else."
3,Plot Similarities,"I'm not sure about this, as I read Sphinx (published in 1979) many years ago, but I read Barbara Michaels' book ""The Jackal's Head"" (published in 1968) last year and it seemed that there were some striking plot similarities."
2,"Delivered late, in poor condition, costly shipping.","This paper archery target could have been rolled in a mailing tube, instead arrived in a box crumpled and folded. By the lateness of delivery and poor condition, I believe it could have been returned to sender by the post office and resent, but there was no explanation or followup by the vendor.The product itself is as advertised; animal targets offering this more ""lifelike"" lack of contrast with the mottled and shadowed background could be better practice than more distinct outline targets."
4,watch winder,Watch winder works well Wish the pillow held the watch a little tighter When it winds it makes noise because the watch moves Does a great job at keeping the watch wound. Directions should clearly state not to use batteries and electricity in the winder Directions say not recommended DO NOT USE both Take the batteries out or they will explode
2,Winds but sounds like a coffee grinder,"This winder worked fine and was very quiet for a month. Then the noise began and continued to get worse. I finally had to move it out of the bedroom, to be able to sleep. Even though this winder has all the features you would want in a winder, I recommend finding one from another manufacturer, unless you don't care about the noise."
1,Tech Swiss Watch Winder,"This product is DEFINITELY not recommended for anyone with a Rolex. Tried it with 2 watches and it did not keep either properly winded. Not sure if it is the built in ""sensory"" system that does not function properly with this brand of watch or it is not meant for a watch of this caliber, but tried it for several weeks and it consistently failed to wind either watch."
5,Great everything....,"I bought this product with some initial hesitation because of the other reviews. The worry went away as soon as I opened the package. I opened up the package to find everything I needed and more. The setup was easy and painless. Everything about this product is great, from the price to the picture. It is easily the best buy for a small screen LCD. I definately will recommend this to anyone looking for a small easy to work TV"
5,Pleased for the price.,"Just received this TV and went through menu setup. The instruction wording should be revised to be more clear. The TV picture quality is above average for this small of a color TV while on the built-in antenna. The remote is a great help. The three power options is very helpful. It also has a cabel TV adapter which worked well. I used the A/V adapter with a DVD player and had no problems. Overall, I am well pleased and would recommend buying through Amazon to be safe. Jerry O."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this thinking that the price was too good to pass. However, as my dad use to say you get what you pay for. It is an alright portable TV. however if I had a chance to actually try it before buying it, I would have not bought it. The signal reception isn't very good. I have an Casio 3"" that I will continue to use, because of it's superiority. I hope to find a use for this one later on down the road."
1,"Don't Buy Haier 7"" Portable TV (or others, probably)","I recentlyHaier HLT71 7-Inch Portable LCD TVbought, and am returning today, this 7"" ""digital"" tv. It won't broadcast any stations, and I live within 30 miles of Seattle. I don't think any ""portables"" will work well with digital, since they didn't with analog, either."
1,"Haier 7"" TFT LCD TV - KXT7020BK","the horsemen of the greetings this article I do not have resivido he Haier 7"" TFT LCD TV - KXT7020BK that I am hoping I replaced by the true gustaria of the delivery that helped to solve this problem me thanks for the carrero amiably Luis"
2,"Okay, but not great. Listenable.","Toni basil had a huge hit with Mickey in the early eighties, but left singing to choreograph for artists such as David Bowie. Fans that have Word of Mouth need not buy this CD because its a disappointment. That Spanish version of Mickey is really funny, and the pictures of her are awfully bad. For a greatest hits album, Im confused, for this only has one."
3,Disappointing,"I enjoyed listening and dancing ""Mickey"" in the eighties, then I liked ""All Over my Head"", so when I saw that the ""Best"" tracks were reissued, I bought the CD. What a mistake! The only tracks that are worth the buy are them. If you are a real fan this CD will make your day but if you are a eighties music fan, don't waste your money."
1,"She tries, she really does","This CD is all the proof anybody will need to show why MS. basil was a one hit wonder. The songs on this CD apart from ""Mickey"" are laughable, forgettable and just plain bad. To say this is a * Best of * CD is really stretching creditability here and in my opinion just plain misleading. This peice of toxic matter is not even worth seeing at the bargain bin of a music store."
3,"Good, but missing some notable tracks.....","Not a bad compilation, but there are a couple of notable songs that should have been included. ""Shopping from A to Z"" and the re-make of ""Rock On"", both from the ""Word of Mouth"" album, should be here, as well as ""Do You Wanna Dance"" from the self-titled album."
3,"In response to ""A Music Fan from Untied (sic) States""","A Music Fan: The album is called the Best of Toni Basil, and I think they were obviously very cautious in naming it. Just because something wasn't a hit doesn't necessarily mean that it was bad. Timing, circulation, videos, all of these also play a crucial role in making - or breaking - a song. I recommend this album if you like Mickey, and want to hear some of her other works, and it's something nice to own if you're a big Toni Basil fan."
3,The Decline and Fall of the M*A*S*H Empire,"Sadly, the seventh season of M*A*S*H is where this series really starts taking a nosedive. One could argue that it was in decline before this season, but as a certified (or is it certifiable?) M*A*S*H addict since elementary school my opinion is that this is when some of the episodes become nearly unwatchable. Granted, it's not nearly as bad as the four seasons Radar did not appear in (seasons 8-11), but there's a reason why, when M*A*S*H is televised in syndication, you'll see far more episodes from the first six seasons than you will from this point on. Although there are still some good episodes in season 7, this is where things start tilting too far (in my opinion, anyway) away from comedy and toward sentimentality. It's also where the attempts at comedy start getting awfully lame. I'm saving the one- and two-star ratings for seasons 8 and on: That's when things REALLY became unbearable."
3,No problem with content,No problem with the disc content but the overall non-image quality of the case and paperwork is quite cheesy.My son has no complaints so if you're not a purist these will work fine.
5,MASH 7th Season,I've been a MASH fan for a good many years and so it's a great thing to watch it at my convenience rather than on regular TV broadcast.
1,bad or dirty discs,"MASH Season 7, plus. I am unsure if there is any quality control on your sale of discs. However the last several that I have purchased were either unplayable or need electronic cleaning. (A $60.00 investment). I know they can be returned however when we get so many bad discs it becomes a real pain to package, mail etc. Why buy from Amazon when we can get the same unplayable discs from Netflix?"
5,I love M*A*S*H,If you love the tv show M*A*S*H this is the way to watch it. No ad'sMany shows on one CD & three CD per collection.Very intertaining
4,Continuing the X-Men Saga,"This volume of the ""Backpack Marvels"" series reprints Uncanny X-Men # 174-179, as well as a short but cheesy Stan Lee story about the first meeting of Storm and Jean Grey. (This book is a direct continuation from Target: Angel, which you should read first if you want to understand all the subplots). High points include the wedding of Cyclops and Madelyne, a fight against the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants that goes badly for Colossus, Storm's continued character changes, the development of Mystique, and the return of the Morlocks, among others. A great continuation of the Essential X-Men series."

5,My favorite high school geometry text,"Jacobs is a great teacher and he has written a book that contains much of the essence of that teaching. He presents the material well, with entertaining hooks and careful exposition. There's a good mix of approaches (transformational, intuitive, and rigorous) and a good mix of problems (easy, medium, hard, a few really hard). It's the best balanced of all the geometry texts I've seen. The one drawback is that it doesn't respond to modern trends of using more discovery-based inductive approaches, or using tools like Geometer's Sketchpad or Cabri. Michael Serra's _Discovering Geometry_ is a good source of problems and activities if you wish to supplement your course with this sort of thing."
5,Worked every problem,"I have no experience with other geometry books--although I did use the Schaum book and other ""outline"" help books early in the school year as a reference. Actually Jacobs was easier to use than the ""outline"" help books. Many problems skate close to calculus (limits are introduced) and analytic geometry. Some problems are quite nearly elegant. Highly recommended."
4,Correction of errors,"I am the author and I wish to correct some very major errors in this description of my book ""Aum Shinrikyo-Japan's Unholy Cult"".This is not a Chinese Mystery but a true story of the terrorist acts involving murders and sarin gas poisoning committed by the Aum Shinrikyo cult in the 1990s in Japan.It should not be classified as a mystery but a true and chilling story of cult terrorism in Japan. The Aum Shinrikyo cult is on the US list of world terrorists. This correction is very important in view of the current world wide interest in terrorism and this book will be promoted as a book on terrorism and not mystery!Thank you!"
4,Bought it in orange and green.,"These blankets are nice and soft. The baby I bought them for loves them. They're a great size, too."
3,Debates with historians,"This is not a history of Russo-Mongol relations, but rather a discussion of how the relation was interpreted. His conclusions are that the Tatars influenced the Russian state structure, that Byzantium influenced the church, that the Russians and Mongols got along fairly well and thet the ideas of a Tartar yoke and Third Rome developed only after 1500. If you know the facts and want to see how they were interpreted, good, but this is not a narative history of the Tartar period in Russian history."
1,Interesting,"Ostrowski, following Halperin, has some interesting theories on the formation of the Russian state. The title is misleading, though--Muscovy, according to Ostrowski, doesn't seem to have influence anyone so it is hardly ""cross cultural."" He should have come up with a different title or found more cases of Russian influence.Many of his ideas should be debated and I plan on doing further research. The only thing I find fault with is that he could have included comparative studies on Mongol influence elsewhere, but perhaps he is saving that for the next volume.He also doesn't discuss in details the many other nomadic peoples of the steppe who influence, and were influenced by, the Russians and the Mongols. One final thing he could have included is more discussion of the early Russian state and political institutions. It was more complex than he allows for and this neglect of his makes the state building of the Mongols seem slightly greater than it was."
2,"Potential, no actualization.","Ostrowski has the potential to write great, readable history. Unfortunately that's all this book shows. This book uses too many references to far to little good. Some chapters (about 20 pages each) have in excess of one hundred references; often there are pages where there are more footnotes than general text. This just exacerbates his problem with spending several pages talking about what other historians say, and then one or two saying his piece. On the plus side his prose if very clear and to the point when he finally wanders into one."
3,Good Gift,I bought this for a friend and they have used it to display pieces of their portfolio. I know it's good because they continue to use it but I don't know how good because I'm not in the same field.
1,buyer beware,- I found this to be poor quality. The adhesive was poor. Product fell off everything I put it on.
2,not a great product,"I got the white reflective stickers, and they are bright, but they aren't ""stickons,"" as in individual pieces. It's a long line of tape, and you can cut them into pieces or smaller, but it's messy and hard to do, the stickers stick to the scissors or fall on the floor. Also, the adhesive was weak and it took a lot of effort to get them to stick. I wouldn't buy them again."
3,Pending Final Result,"If it keeps the pigeons off me in St. Mark's Square, it was a worthwhile investment."
5,great buy!,"Great buy, looks exactly as in the picture. Be aware that it is VERY short. I'm only 5 feet tall and the small barely covers my rear. Other than that it is very cute, affordable and the shipping was very prompt."
4,Good Solid Album,Through the Years&I Don't Need You are The Cuts.together with Lionel Richie this is a Very Essential Kenny Rogers Album.Goin'back to Alabama features Lionel Richie&Michael Jackson SInging The Chorus you gotta Pick Yourself Up&turn yourself Around.a Very Lively Line.Kenny Sounds Good Here.
5,A great book for young and old.,"""I do not want to be a lady I want to be a wool merchant"" That line is how I always describe this book. Young Maude wants to be a wool merchant but in medival Europe young girls where sent off to become ladys not merchants. This is a wonderful story I remember reading as a child and cherish it. I hope to find a copy to read to my own children."
3,a loud romance,"My main `complaint' with this album is that for a CD labeled the romantic violin, the orchestra, overpowers the playing of the violin in so many instances. Now I know from attending symphonies, even those where Joshua Bell has played, this is often the case - the way the composer wrote it. I know it still does not have to be interpreted this way and I do not like having to turn up and down the volume when I am listening to music to appreciate the nuances of the soloist or having the orchestra parts overwhelm me, my neighbors or the car sitting next to me. I am a huge admirer of Joshua Bell for years and remember telling lovers of classical music what a star he would be. He has fulfilled his promise. I just wish his recording companies would"
2,May be...,"I'd love to review this item, but Amazon has failed totally to produce the goods. In fact I've waited so long I've gone out and ordered it from a real live shop with people at the end of a phone. How can Amazon imagine that they produce a good service if it takes longer than six weeks to realise an order. No, I have not ""purchased this CD"" - it hasn't arrived yet after six weeks of waiting. When it comes ( and I've waited six months in the past for another Amazon CD) it will be returned immediately. I would have benefitted if Amazon had said - It will take a long time for this CD to arrive - we are not very good at delivering. I would need to know before ordering that Amazon can't deliver!"
3,Needs more supplemental materials,"We use this text as well as the accompanying lab manual in our introductory course (Intro to circuit analysis). For the most part this book is adequately laid out, with many topics covered as well as practical applications. What is lacking however, is in-depth explanations of the equations - that is, how/why they are using the numbers they are, especially the why. Perhaps a study guide and/or a solutions manual would be a good complement to the text itself.This book assumes too many things, and being an introductory level book, more explanations are necessary."
3,ok,I would think people would know how to take care of a VIRTUAL pet!! I haven't got it yet but I do not want it :c
3,OVERPRICED,"DON'T YOU THINK THIS ITEM IS OVERPRICED? SURE ITS THE OFFICAL TAMAGOTCHI PET CARE AND GUIDE BOOK BUT $2,395.82! JUST FOR A BOOK. SURE IT HAD A LOT OF EFFORT IN WRITING EVERYTHING AND MAKING IT, BUT ITS STILL JUST A BOOK. AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE THAT..."
5,Great for the Office!,Bought this for my office and I now have a collection of different players. They look good on a desk or bookcase. Very durable and incredible detail! I can even see Larry Johnson's tattoo and they're actually his real tattoos!
4,Better than average thriller,This is a better than average thriller. The killer is pretty twisted. I left off one star because I was able to put it down many times; 5 star books won't let me do that.
1,Too perverted for me,I bought this after reading one review. I wish I had read more as this was a horrible book that I didn't read after the beginning. I don't get how people can read this ugly stuff
5,The Ocean on your shower door.,The art work on this shower curtain makes you feel as you are living on the ocean. Great material product.
3,"More Rick, less filler, please","I may be the only reviewer who actually likes Nona Hendryx's offering here, ""The Heart of a Woman"". Otherwise, although Rick was generous in spotlighting other (some, I believe, among his favorite) artists on this soundtrack, it might have been a more cohesive effort if it had all been Rick's show. Think about it; didn't ""Purple Rain"" make better sense for excluding The Time's ""Jungle Love"" and ""The Bird""? Anyway, ""Love Somebody"", ""Don't Walk Away"", and ""Stand Up"" are as enjoyable today as they were 15 years ago. ""Taxi Dancing"" and ""The Great Lost Art of Conversation"" are good efforts, but seem a little too much like typical soundtrack ballads. Still, this is worth owning for true fans; you're not gonna get ""Stand Up"" from a best-of (though, strangely enough, you will get ""Taxi Dancing"". Go figure). Don't worry, Rick; in the long run, people will remember a soundtrack longer than they'll remember the movie anyway."
4,Nice To Hold,"Rick Springfield's 1984 soundtrack featuring 7 Rick tracks with great musicians including Peter Gabriel is a nice album to add to your CD collection. LOVE SOMEBODY, WALK AWAY, and BOP TIL YOU DROP are no doubt classic hits (particularly I love Bop Til You Drop). TAXI DANCING ended up with a minor hit eclipsed ironically by the re-release of Beautiful Feeling is a nice duet. STAND UP is really exciting live track somewhat like that of Heuy Lewis and Eddie and the Cruisers. Peter Gabriel's I'm Not Swimming is so so track. Recommended for Rick fans old and new."
3,Great Album & Great Movie,I am a big fan of ricks and have been since the 80's ..seeing this movie came out back in the 80's i really don't feel this album should cost $30 it should be $12 to at least $14..so is why i am giving this a low rating the $ is way to high for an old album that came out back in the 80's sorry..
2,Ouch!!,"This album only has a few good songs on it. Half of the songs are really bad and they have the audacity to charge $42.98 for it? I'm glad I bought my copy at a pawn shop for $3.00. If you want the few good songs on this cd, just buy the ""Best of Rick Springfield"" cd for a lot less."
2,Trip the Night Away,"Trip the Light produces a modern pop sound that combines retro and folk and crosses Jimi Hendrix with Natalie Merchant. REACH is a hearty album which highlights such tracks ""Mr. Personality"" and ""Can I Be."" However a better option is the debut album from Nowhere Fast, WITH EVERY TURN."
5,Best book on Henry and the House of Burgesses,A must read for anyone interested in Henry and the time period.It does go easy on Henry with his battles with Jefferson.
4,The most complete biography of Patrick Henry and much more.,"Patrick Henry one of the greatest founding fathers and the match of the American Revolution!For such a popularizing figure...there's not a lot of books on the subject.This book lacks a little information on Patrick Henry's childhood but it captures his career as a lawyer and politician. This book is also very complete in Virgina history. I picked up several new areas of history and it even details Washington, Jefferson, Madison, etc.Hi recommend this book to all lovers of History!"
2,Havent i heard this before?,"No originality, just lame metalcore riffs. I do not see any talent in this band, jus angry fat guys. I hear they put on a great live show, but if their playing lame songs, then why see them live at all? There was even a song which i knew the riff was familiar, and they totally ripped off NOTE FOR NOTE a slayer song. Not impressed at all. If you like music strictly for violence and breakdowns, this is fine for you."
5,AN EXTREMLY INSPIRING BOOK ON A TRADITIONAL PRODUCT,"AN INSIGHT VIEW OF A SUCCESSFUL BIZ. I HAVE BEEN WORKING IN COFFEE TRADE FOR 10 YEARS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST INSPIRING BOOKS I'VE EVER READ. IT IS BETTER THAN ANY BUSINESS BOOK AS IT HAS MANY ACTUAL FRESH CASE STUDIES, MARKETING AESTHETICS AND A LOT OF ENERGY. I BELIEVE THE WAY MR SCHULTZ TREAT HIS COMPANY AS THE NEW PARADIGM OF THE 21ST CENTURY: FOCUS ON THE PEOPLE."
3,"Good story, terrible writing","A good business story, but some of the writing is so awful its hard to believe this book got past an editor. Perhaps when you are CEO of one of the world's trendiest companies everyone afraid to say no?If you are interested in business management though its a decent book."
3,Good Insights,"The book offers good insights into the world of Starbucks and how it all started.I read it because I am exploring opening a beverage business so it was good for me to get an idea about how similar businesses start and how they take off.However, the book gets sepetitive sometimes because it is in part a merketing tool for the CEO of Starbucks about his vision and dreams to the point that you wonder if he is talking about Starbucks the corporation or Starbucks the small store where he started as an empoyee.overall a nice book if you are interested in learning about the company and getting some insights into the process of starting a beverage company."
5,A REVIEW FROM BRAZIL,"What a wonderful and inspiring life story! Not another theoretical idea of what the world itself should be shown by an eager CEO ... but a bright practical must-daily-exercise-philosophy taught by a very broad-minded human being. Congratulations, Mr.Howard Schultz and friends. Thanks, Amazon.com for this opportunity to review POUR YOUR HEART INTO IT."
5,Inspiring,"Half way through this book I was inspired to buy my first cup of Starbucks coffee... two weeks later I had quit a better paying job to work as a barista for Starbucks... I eventually had to move on, but the two years that I spent working for Starbucks were some of the best years (in respect to employment) of my life. I love this company, and have a great respect for Howard Schults. I highly recommend this book."
4,You can clearly see the passion that went into building this brand,Nicely captures the passion and zeal that went into building the Starbucks brand. Howard Schultz has done a wonderful job so far; it will be interesting to see how he handles the next phase...with all the fast food chains entering the gourmet coffee business and with the changing consumption patterns the road is probably going to be rougher.
2,Loved and Learned From This Book,"There was so much to learn about Starbucks itself. So, just the story of its evolution was interesting.But the story itself is inspiring, the author is brutally honest about his mistakes, near misses and even his struggles with his own ego. (I love the story about how he didn't want skim milk to be available, because it wasn't ""pure."")There is so much to learn from this manager. I was inspired by the way he empowered his staff and love the way he moves up his own people. A company that offers health insurance to their part-time employees, it is such a different way of management.I love this book. I have a deeper appreciation for corporate growth and a good cup of coffee."
5,Must read for people working in start ups,"This is a very good book. If you have enjoyed Lee Icoca's book and Jack Welch's book, then you will enjoy this one also.Schultz provides a good narrating of events that made the Starbucks company and also his feelings along the way. Folks working in small start up firms will benefit from this book because they will see the merit of managing day to day operations in the short term and at the same time, have the big picture for the long term."
3,An impressive story told in a questionable way,"You've got to admire Shultz's passion and ambition and the story itself, but unfortunately the book's attitude feels sanctimonious more often than not. The author came across as disingenuous on certains subjects such as competition with independent stores and community acceptance. Also, I found it repetitive; I think it could have easily been edited down by 50-60 pages. One thing's for sure if you're not a Starbucks regular: it makes you want to go to the nearest Starbucks, check it out the colors and atmosphere, and get a Grande Latte. Then after doing that, you'll want to look for the indie store and try to help the little guy."
4,Good story but a bit dated by now,"Howard Schultz tells a very interesting story of how Starbucks became what it is today. However, the book is about 15 years old now I believe so it's a bit dated. Still a good read and have recommended it to friends."
4,Good read,"Enjoyed the book, nice to read about someone who loves his work. We could use more examples like this today."
4,Well worth the price of 3 mochaccinos!,"Howard Schultz's narrative of the Starbucks story is fascinating and strikes an emotional cord on several occasions such as when he learns about his dad's cancer and when he almost lost Starbucks to a private investor.Though he seldom talks about most business issues in depth, he conveys that Starbucks success is because of his ability to successfully deal with people and sell them his dream.He is no coffee purveyor (he leaves that to Alfred Peet of Peet's Coffee and Tea and the original Starbucks Owners), but is an entreprenuer who saw a business opportunity and passionately pursued it...very much like Jeff Bezos (Amazon.com: Get Big Fast by Robert Spector). Btw, his childhood experiences are eerily similar to that of Sumner Redstone (Autobiography: A Passion To Win).Bottom line: a lively read and inspirational to entrepreneurs or otherwise."
4,THAT'S why we love his coffee!,"We serve Starbucks' coffee at our B&B on Block Island. Read Howard's book, and you'll understand why"
4,Inside Story About The Rise Of The Starbucks Coffee Chain,"I really enjoyed reading this interesting book, written by Howard Schultz, who led Starbucks from a sleepy Pacific Northwest chain into a worldwide phenomenon.Schultz's book is about more than just a cup of coffee; he writes about having a dream and staying with it, making personal life choices that seem nutty to everyone else - such as quitting a secure job to go work for Starbucks.I highly recommend this book for business majors and anyone who is thinking about starting their own small business."
4,An Entrepreneur's Guide to How to Make it Big,Schultz not only is a great storyteller; he provides the reader with so many ways to refer back to the book with his catchy subtitles and quotes. What struck me most was his ability to reiterate time and time again the importance of relationships and how you treat your people to the success of any organization. His remark that a business who is satisfied with serving a customer coffee from a pot that is sitting there for an hour is not one he wants to deal with shows just how important it is to set standards and keep them.
1,"Walk across the bridge, Howard!","It's amazing to me that Howard grew up in Brooklyn yet claims that the day the first cup of espresso was served in Seattle in the early 80's was the first time Americans ever tasted Italian espresso. Now why do you suppose he never walked across the Brooklyn Bridge to Little Italy to stop in at any number of the old cafes that have espresso bars? I grew up in the Boston area and moved there in 1975 and then to the North End, the Italian section, and weekly stopped in at the decades-old Cafe Vittoria on Hanover Street for cappuccino and moccacino...long before Howard Schultz got his hands on Starbucks!"
1,WHY?,"Cannot see why this book received so many stars from the readers...especially when considering Starbuck's losing its core thesedays...It's not anymore just about coffee... It's about making successful business model...and there's happen to be a coffe story...This book itself could be inspirational for people who are in need of self-help book, but cannot expect anything like ""seeing Starbucks in a whole new way after reading it""...in my opinion...Plus, from my experiences of living many yrs in different cities around the world I hope that Starbuck could care a little more about its international branch management...in terms of quality of its product and service..."
2,"Sorry, nothing inspirational here","I read all kinds of books and try to be open minded about what I expect from them. This was like drinking weak tea and barely kept my attention. The author never told me what forces were at work inside him, what drove him, what scared him, what motivated him. What should I have gained from this? Superficial..save your money...sorry."
2,"Sorry, nothing inspirational here in the cassette","I read all kinds of books and try to be open minded about what I expect from them. This audio cassette was like drinking weak tea and barely kept my attention. The author/actor never told me what forces were at work inside him, what drove him, what scared him, what motivated him. What should I have gained from this? Superficial and weak. Maybe the book was better as a reviewer indicated..save your money on the cassette...sorry."
3,Great Inspiration for aspiring Entrepreneur,"This book is written in a conversational manner that describes how the author has innovated a new way of drinking coffee in America. It retells some of the challenges the author had to face to make his dream alive. It focuses a lot on having a Passion, having an eye for opportunity, having a vision and perserverance. If you are looking for a book to inspire you onwards with your entrepreneurial dreams, this book might just be the one."
5,Great Management Lessons,A book that is so hard to put down once you start to read it. I am a coffee lover and there are lots of Starbucks in Singapore where I am from BUT I was not a Starbucks fan before I started reading this book. Howard Schultz poured his heart into this books as much as he did for Starbucks.Lots of management lessons one can learn from him and Starbucks Corp. Top companies should learn NOT to cut costs through employee benefits! Never also cut costs on quality. Give customers what they really want and not what you think they want ... ...I am a convert now ... gimme a grande latte for here anytime!
1,"Ignore the book, stick to the coffee","Very colorful descriptions about coffee, passion, persistance and fate. I expected to read a respectable minibiography about the details of the business not a romantic novel about the author's love for coffee and people. It's a marketing and PR tool. Why else would he write a book so early in his career? Starbucks' story can be told in 10 pages, yet this book streches is out with many pages of coffee love stories. I wish the author hadn't written a book so early in Starbucks' life and saved the story for a better more interesting book. 1 star because marketing works, and it worked on everyone who gave this book a positive review. Don't buy it and refuse it if given for free."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This is the biggest piece of self-serving garbage that I've ever read. Howard Schultz loves to pat himself on the back for being so enlightened, but his PR myth is falling apart. Maybe he'll write a sequel about the many ""partners"" that he threw under the bus when the going got tough. Until he does, let's just classify this book as a piece of fiction, and a bad piece of fiction at that."
5,What an enjoy to read,Rejuvenated my passion for the entrepreneurial spirit as well as in an appreciation for good coffee. Anyone who is going into business should read this and attempt to model its ideals.
3,the Rise of Starbucks,This book starts out slowly but picks up to show what determination and a belief in self and a product can accomplish. I enjoyed the book but feel at times it was written too simplistically.
2,Good company history,"I found reading about the history of Starbucks very interesting, I thought he could have told the story in a shorter version."
4,"Cute design, comes off easily","Cute tattoos, go on and come off easily, what more could you possibly want? Having them stapled to the little booklet makes it easier to find them (for mea, at least)."
4,"Pretty pictures, great gift","This Dover little Book has ten pictures of the delicate creatures. The prettiest is a flying fairy with a wand. Others include a small fairy atop a tortoise, one riding a frog, a little elf with a mouse friend, and other fairies and elves with flowers. They make a great treat for youngsters or others who like fairies."
4,talented mr. riply,"all I can say is how amazed I was by this film, as well as the soundtrack. I felt pulled into this movie due to the story and the music---"
2,Ummmm.....,"Just saw the movie, liked the soundtrack, came on Amazon to buy. Saw the composer's comments. Am thinking maybe he should not bite the hand that feeds him!"
5,'Matches the perplexing personality of the title character,"Most of the earlier reviewers have shared my sentiments and praise for this most eclectic blend of jazz, classical, and traditional movie scoring. It captures the many moods of ""Tom Ripley,"" one of literature's most captivating and complex characters.The only drawback, if any, is the fact that the selections do not appear in sequential order from the film. That, however, does not sully their effectiveness, providing the listener with an enjoyable and quite diverse listening experience."
5,Stabat Mater,"Get this cd just for 'Stabat Mater"". It is one of the best songs ever written, and I don't believe you can get a better performance of it on another cd.bless you.wa"
4,Great music - Italy,I use this in my personal video slide shows of our trip to Italy. Several of the cuts on this album are perfect for making you feel you are actually in Italy. Matt Damon singing My Funny Valentine is better than I thought it would be.
3,Okay,"Not bad. Didn't really minister to me spiritually or anything, but it was a decent story on a relevant topic. I'll try her again."
4,Not A Bad Product!,"I purchased this product from Best Buy store only to find out later that circut city had it for $20. cheaper but too late now!Product very easy to setup and use,good picture and sound quality.Not really worth the money to get the larger 8in. brother to this model no big difference in picture size.Mounts secure between seats with provided straps,the kids will love it."
1,Worthless piece of junk!,I bought 2 new Audiovox VBP700 DVD players for our kids to use during vacation trips. The units were always handled with care and played indoors. They were never abused or mishandled. After several hours of use the first unit stopped working. The disc would spin but no video displayed. I exchanged this unit 2 weeks after purchase for a new one. The second original DVD player broke in similar fashion approximately 1 week after the 90 day warranty expired. The exchanged player (#3) broke 11 months after purchase with only 15-20 hours of play time.I will never buy another Audiovox product based on my experience with these DVD players.
4,Not bad at all,"I think the best part of this player is the FM modulator. Plug it into your cigarette lighter and not only does it power your player but also transmits the sound to your radio. The picture controls seems limited however, not much you can adjust. Also comes with a nice carrying case."
3,Over the basics,"I got this book for a introduction to hypnosis. Honestly compared to some of the books out there this one is well written, but very light in content.If you wan the absolute basics of hypnosis and its background. Check this book out."
2,I don't understand the raves about this flick. It was lame and too predictable,"I just watched it last night on cable so I'm not mad about paying for it. I just wanted to put my two cents in since it's getting 4 & 1/2 stars here. I knew the ending of this movie within the first five minutes as most people will. All I can think is that maybe when it came out this was the first one with this kind of ending. I love 70's chillers and absolutely love horror movies so I was expecting to enjoy this. I was wrong. It was not eerie, scary, thrilling, chilling or surprising at all. I gave it 2 (more like 1 & 1/2) stars just because it held my interest although I almost dozed off a few times. I hope I saved someone some cash haha."
4,Let's Have It on DVD Please,"I saw this movie many years ago on late night TV and it made an indelible impression. Later tracked down the book by former actor, Tom Tryon. A fine piece of atmospheric rural horror. Creepy as hell, with some great unsentimental twists. Director Robert Mulligan served the story well. Love to compare my memory with an up to date viewing. Let's have it on DVD one day soon please. I'm afraid VHS is a sunset (or sundown) technology at our place."
5,the other,"This is by far one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The story is incredible. I'm surprised no one tried to remake this flim, clearly overlooked. This is a true movie lover's horror flim. Some one with sense, not for people who want to see heads chopped off, and a lot of blood. This movie will make you rewind (due to the fact it's not on dvd) and watch over and over."
5,One of the scariest movies ever made!,"The Other should be a classic, but is so severly over-looked! This should be seen only by people who like psychological horror films. This isn't for the Scream-Generation, this is for intelligent people. Now I must compare this movie to The Omen and The Exorcist. Let's see, in my oppinion The Exorcist and The Omen are scarier. Sorry if that offends anyone, but that is the honest truth. This film however has a much better story that those two, and dare I say better actors? Sure why not. This is a very scary and disturbing movie, kind of a mix between The Good Son, The Shining, and The Omen. But this is an original masterpiece that has yet to be copied. This is not for casual horror buffs, this is for the ones that like more than random sex and blood in there movies. The Other is a criminally underated and should be taken seriously. WHERE THE HECK IS THE DVD!!!! Watch this one alone in the dark for the ultimate effect!"
4,Weird Is Good,"I recall this always coming on network tv back in the day, usually on Saturdays in the afternoon... so I'd be watching it of course thinking what the hell? So therefore it's good lol."
3,"Great movie, poor format!","This needs to be released on DVD widescreen. A wonderful film poorly served on vhs.One of the best aspects of this film was the cinematography, which was used to great effect to set the sense of place and the extremely disturbing relationship between the twins.Impact greatly reduced by full screen format."
4,Truly Amazing,"Why have I never heard of this movie before???? Totally out of any spotlight, this movie is much like Holland (the evil twin brother) lurking in the shadows. THe movie would have been considered a classic had it not been burried by the teen horrors of the 1970's and had more exposure. It is upsetting to me that there are people out there who that have no clue what they are missing. As said by others, this movie is more psychological than a ""bloody mess horror flick"" or a ""Boo, I made your heart stop thriller."" There is a creepiness to this film that out does many more succesful horror films. The almost surreal uneasiness sends the minds of those with imaginations to a far distant place. The dynamics of the film works very well with the plot. Instead of the watcher getting thrown right into the madness, they are simmered to a slow boil. THe movie deserves way more attention and should again be revealed to the world."
5,Disturbing,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, and it creeped me out to this day. I won't spoil the plot for you but please notice I gave it five stars. If you are into psychological thrillers and whodunits, this is for you.There is no axe-wielding maniac or alien monster to be found. The monsters in this story are all too human, which makes it all the more terrifying.The ending will make you gasp...UPDATE: Just received my copy of the DVD and I was very disappointed in the jacket/flyer which gives away the whole story. If you buy this DO NOT READ THE LINER NOTES BEFORE SEEING THE MOVIE"
4,Immediate history of 30s,"What makes this book unique is that it was written in 1941, so you get the perspective of the timeperiod written by a trained historian, but done right after 1930's are over. My work site does living history from 1939, and this is a very useful resource, particularly for what was occupying people's thoughts at the time."
5,POWER!!!!!!,"This CD is awesome. It's very refreshing to hear good music with a good message. The world is in need of an alternative to sex, drug wars, and violence and I'm so greatful to be able to have this for myself and my children to groove to. This is a powerfull tool. God gives gifts in so many great ways in order to constantly pursue HIS excellence and give hope to the world -every generation is in need of the savior and GOD'S Army and their music is one of HIS tools. Thanks and keep answering the call and giving the world good music."
4,razor and tie does their usual great compilation job,"All the ones you'd want to hear, and nicely sequenced. All and all, better than the four cd box which has alot of stiffs from his later years. No live tho, so I docked it a star."
4,Where the Blues Come From,"I first heard this cd between dives in PR, and thought I was hearing Santana, a later cut made me think it was Clapton--I had to stop my lunch conversation, get the staff to show me the CD & tell me about the group. If they had let me buy their only copy--I would have right then. They are terrific!"
5,Excellante,"I first heard a couple of cuts from this disc on internet radio station ""Blue Icewater Radio"" and immediately ordered the disc. The whole disc is excellante! I mean, Puerto Rican Blues? Can you dig it?"
2,This ain't it!,"I love Melba's voice and many of her recordings but they never should have re-named this cd after the real THIS IS IT album produced by Van McCoy. Melba Moore did most of her finest recordings with McCoy which were not necessarily her biggest hits but splendid performances. It's too bad that the memory of Van McCoy (a great singer, composer, arranger and conductor) has been relegated to Disco because of 2 or 3 major hits that he had during the 70's. The real THIS IS IT album has most of his Melba Moore corroborations on it. Save your money for the real thing. This is not a good example of the BEST of Melba Moore."
5,Melba is a true diva!,"This compilation of Melba Moore's greatest hits is truely a work of art. Her vocals are impeccably strong and soothing. My favorites are ""Falling"" and ""A Little Bit More"", a duet with soulful singer Freddie Jackson. She will go down in history as one of the greatest black songtresses of all time. Where are you Melba? I have truly missed you; but until I hear from you again I will have this album close to my heart and in my CD changer!"
4,Good classic Melba,"I enjoyed this album and listening to some of the Dance Tracks that made Melba's songs a favorite in the early 1980's. I just wished she included her version of ""Lift every voice and sing"""
2,Better than no dog book,"A travel book without maps strikes me as not much of a travel book at all. While there is a lot of info. in this book, it's not easy-to-use. I'd rather have some directions, maps and tips than stories about Luna and Chaser and what kind of spaghetti sauce they prefer."
2,Not enough substance,"While this book provides a large number of listings about the local parks and other places, there are serious flaws. First of all, there are no maps (!), and directions are minimal or missing from most listings. Second, a lot of the descriptions contain more details about the author's dogs than about the places they visited, which is fun, but largely unhelpful. Finally, a lot of the information is out of date (although that's par for the course with any guidebook). As a resident of Chicago, I found it only slightly useful. I think a visitor to the city would have a hard time using it at all."
4,"The most anticipated G&F Volume yet, and for good reason.","This volume has ""Video Airlines,"" possibly the best ep of Garfield and Friends ever - most people probably know it as the one with the Kung Fu Creatures on the Rampage, TWO.""Tu! Tu no eres Sylvia! Tu eres una de las criaturas de Kung Fu en rampaje - DOS!""I never get tired of that. But you should buy this because G&F; is the last of a dead breed - quality Saturday Morning animation that anyone can enjoy, because the writing is well done, even though the animation is definitely on the cheap side.I did wish that this set had some more extra features than just the Garfield movie trailer (Don't watch that movie, by the way). Writer's commentary by Mark Evanier would have been nice, but I wasn't holding my breath. That's the only real criticism I can levy against this, though. If you love cartoons, or just like to laugh, this is a set to buy."
5,More Garfield?! HORRAY!!!!,WHOOOHOOO! Season 2!Garfield returns to DVD for the complete 2nd season!Ran from 1989 to 1990.Amoung the classic storylines one of them is when Binky the clown gets accused of robbing a store.It is worth getting!!!!!!
1,not worth the money,This set is super cheap(not just the price). You would be better off picking up a set like this at walmart.
2,Track Listing : Not impressive,"If you want a greatest hits album from Megadeth get a hold of ""capitol punishment"" instead. This ""greatest hits"" tracklisting is the worst I've ever seen on a greatest hits compilation. The track listing was picked by die hard fans, and die hard fans are too close-minded to like popular stuff by the band. Songs like ""she-wolf"", ""prince of darkness"", ""kill the king"", ""dread and the fugitive mind"" just don't belong on the album over hits like ""almost honest"", ""use the man"", ""crush em"". Heck even ""breadline"" was a more popular song that most tracks on this album."
1,Blah !,"I've been a diehard Megadeth fan since Mustang left Metallica and am disappointed with this album. Sure the music's good, but it's nothing I couldn't put together myself in my own free time. As a matter of fact I have and I believe my playlist of favorites is much better than this regurgitated pap. This is an album put together by graph-paper-brained accountants instead of music fans. It's all about the money and how many suckers they can get to pay for music they've already bought. An I'll bet this review will never make it on the amazon review page."
2,Beware! The songs are re-mixed as well as remastered!,"This cd is interesting for fans who already own the original cds, but if you are looking for the tracks you need - do not buy this! Dave Mustaine decided to remix most of the songs - wtf! I dont want a 'remix' - especially ones that arent any better. Examples are cutting out the bass lines in 'in my darkest hour', ruining the drum sounds, making the vocals s****ier etc..I kept the non-edited tracks off this thing, but deleted the rest. For every thing that Dave improves on the tracks, there are two things he ruined. Beware ! I was sooo pissed when i listened to this.."
4,Megadeth...the CliffNotes version,"I'll start by saying ""yeah I know its rather shallow and if you really want the meat you need to buy 'Peace Sells', 'Rust in Peace', and 'Countdown to Extinction'"". But this CD gives you the essentials. However, it is glaring that one of their biggest hits ""Foreclosure of a Dream"" is missing here from a supposed ""Greatest Hits"" album, and I take away one star just for that. (I mean come on! if its a hits album than by God put the HITS on it!)"
5,Megadeth - Greatest Hits was one of my greatest buys,"It's a great CD jampacked full of Megadeth's most brutal songs. My only complaint is that they didn't put ""Sleepwalker"" on there.If you're a Megadeth fan, this CD is a must-have!~Andy"
5,An Excellent Collection,"Though Megadeth's Hardcore fans may be a bit disapointed. Simply cause they had chosen more popular and well known songs, Instaed of a more random approach. This is an excellent collection none the less, With well known metal anthems like Symphony of Destruction and the ever popular Trust. But one song that stands out above them is Kill The King, This song was actually voted to be on the album on Megadeths site by the fans. All together this is a good start for people who are new to Megadeths many works and old fans who want these beauties on one disc. The songs sound better then ever, Obviously the remastered versions! And seeing the long list of great songs is allways a plus. Buy this album, You won't regret it.. Unless your a certain Green Day fan whom shouldn't even be looking at Megadeth in the first place!"
5,Best book on child-rearing I have read,"We raised our 3 children using Dr. Rosemond's philosophies and it brought peace and calm to our home and enabled us to raised well-adjusted, successful kids. I bought this book as a gift for young parents b/c I think this man gives the best advice of all the guru's because it makes sense and it WORKS!!"
1,Neglect and anger your child,"This book ignores all the known facts about children, and relies on old myths, phony ""anecdotes"" and the author's strange ideas. Spending more time alone with your spouse than time playing and talking with your child is not any guarantee for healthy children, quite the opposite. Neglecting children harms them. Shutting kids out when they are hurting and needing parental love only makes problems worse. The author knows this well, since his own father left the family and the author was raised by a demanding, cold-hearted single mother. The author admits he was a juvenile delinquent, yet he insists children be raised as he was: with little attention, and no friendship or playing with parents. What garbage! This book may appeal to parents who don't like their children and want to kid themselves about how children don't really need love and attention. But if you're a normal, caring parent skip this book. And have some fun playing with your child instead."
2,Disappointing,"I'm currently reading the Six-Point Plan for Raising Happy, Healthy Children and I'm astounded at how ridiculous some of these suggestions are on how to parent. I would like to quote a particular rule Mr. Rosemond lists....""Don't overdose your children emotionally by giving them too much attention or too much praise. If you pay too much attention to your children, they have no reason to pay attention to you.""This sounds absurd to me as a parent. Mr. Rosemound encourages the reader to use their common sense when parenting but I can't see how children can thrive under these suggestion. Isn't lack of attention what's causing problems in American children today?With that being said, I do agree with a few of his ideas however, I'm so put off by so many of his other ideas that I don't think it's worth the read. Quite honestly, I would be more interested in reading a book based on his wife's thoughts on parenting with a parenting expert in the house:)"
3,interesting point of view,my wife and i think this book is okay. its definitely worth reading if you are trying to get various opinions on child rearing.
5,Great book!,"I was given this book to read in the sixth grade. It has helped me immensely and is the reason why I earned an A in my Composition class during my freshman year in college (while other students had major issues constructing proper sentences). It was still being used in my middle school six years later, and it helped improve my niece's grammar as well."
5,A gift,"Summer's Flowdreaming technique is incredible. I have read so many books and listened to other CDs, but this is what truly hit home for me.This technique is an alternate to meditation, but still brings you to your higher self. There, you are the creator of your life. It is absolutely amazing and I just can't say enough good things about it. I feel a surge of energy and joy throughout the day whenever I think about ""The Flow."" It is a technique to solve any problems you are having in your life whether it be lack of money, job situations, relationships, health issues...anything!Summer's voice is so soothing as she guides you through this process.If you want the basics to Flowdreaming, check out Summer's radio show on hayhouseradio.com. Then give yourself the gift of ordering any/all of her Flowdreaming CDs."
5,Works for us!,"Maybe these are 'coincidences' not linked to this, but I highly doubt it. We got the Money one and within DAYS of listening to it, won 500.00 off of a scratch lottery ticket! We've NEVER won that much in a lottery before! THEN....money started appearing to us from all kinds of sources, many unexpected. and much, much MORE is continuing to happen in our lives in other areas as well. WOW. THANK YOU THANK YOU, Summer, for producing and sharing this with the world."
3,too many irons in the fire,The text content is fine. Summer should have had someone else do the audio. She sounds so impatient. The effect is not calming.
1,Stop flowing YOUR money in the wrong direction!,"I was very excited to try this CD, given how short the segments are, and the assumption, that it was not ""meditation"".Well, like someone else mentions, she goes on extremely fast and she is loud. Worst of all, the rythm of the narration put me to sleep every single time! Also, when you're trying to ""get into the flow"" the instructions don't even make much sense.Lastly, but not least; it DOES NOT WORK. I didn't see any changes whatsoever, not even found a penny on the street, while listening to it.Just save your money and visualize on your own.It gets one star only because Amazon doesn't allow to give zero stars."
1,ZERO STARS!,"I gave this a fair shot about 45 days. NOTHING! She does talk really fast but I was able to deal wit that however, there has bene no flow of money, abundance, luck or anything. I listen to it twice a day. NOTHING! Think I had more bad luck by using the CD. Flow Dream some where else people!"
3,"Slow down, lady...","Bless her cotton socks, the concept is great, but the speed with which Summer narrates the guided imagery is faster than your 'inner eye' can keep pace with. There is absolutely no relaxing in the relaxation exercise - she's way too perky, enthusiastic, fast and LOUD!! But like I said, the concept is great and her imagery is good if you can just keep up with it."
2,Good Content/Message but Poor Execution,"Overall, I liked the message/content of the CD. However, the author, who also serves as the only narrator, does her product a disservice by using her own voice. As you listen, you try to relax as the message persuades you to do, but it is extremely difficult due to the narrator's jarring, fast-paced, overly-perky voice. For example, she will instruct the listener to imagine a scenario and before the listener can even begin the imagination process, the narrator is jumping along to the next thought sequence. The pace and voice completely disrupts the message."
5,I won't be passing the book on. . .,"I bought this book thinking I would read it and pass it on. Nope, I want to read it again. I liked Grizzly Years, one of the first books you could find at the time which wasn't a grizzly attack book (there are alot of those) and I was real interested to see what else Doug Peacock had to say. . . and I think it rates a second reading. There is something important in this book about man-kind, violence, and the natural world. New thoughts to absorb. Thanks Doug . .kept up the good work and I can hardly wait for your next book."
3,Much better than the two most recent Abbey biographies,"I was extremely disappointed by the two most recent Abbey biographies. ""Adventures With Ed"" was, in my opinion, a huge exercise in ego for Jack Loeffler. Hey Jack, it's not about you! The second book, ""Edward Abbey: A Life"", read like a doctoral thesis. There was little new and it was poorly presented.Those expecting ""Walking It Off"" to be an Abbey biography will be sorely disappointed. While the book does contain some nice Abbey reminiscences by Peacock the focus of the book is not Edward Abbey.Still, the Peacock book is a much better read due to the fact that Peacock is a much better story teller than Loeffler. The book could have used a better editor and I found many grammatical mistakes.This book is a must for Abbey fans, but I think the definitive book on Abbey is yet to be written."
2,Not what I expected unfortunately,"""Walking it off"" dwells too much on Peacock's feelings for Ed Abbey and tells you very little about his Viet Nam experiences or even himself.It was a very disappointing read for me.For an outstanding read, see his book ""Grizzly Years""."
2,bouncing ball,"I could'nt hardly wait for this book to. When I finally did get the book, I was disapointed in the bouncing thoughts and emotions that it contained. I loved Grizzly years, but this book left me feeling disapointed. I feel that a story wasnt told. Instead it left 2 untold stories, one of Doug Peacock and how he deals with the War, and the other of how Doug climbs in the Hymalia's. I think he could have written 3 seperate books on these subjects."
4,Walking It Off: A Veteran's Chronicle of War and Wilderness,"If you like hiking in wilderness areas, the desert SW or are a big Edward Abbey fan, you will enjoy this book. Even though the author spends a lot of time in self reflection related to his post Vietnam War pshycological after effects, he is passionate about wilderness areas and takes us to places that most of us will never get to except in the pages of this book."
3,'Provocative' may not be the right word,"If you are thinking they are using the word 'provocative' in a sexual way you'll find this book quite disappointing. Except for a few stories that cross slightly into the 'adult' areas, for example a nun describing the first time a priest put his hand up her skirt, this book is instead simply entertaining. The stories are well written and do not keep to a certain environment or time frame making each story unique and different than all the others.All in all I'd say this is an excellent anthology that skips over the 'extreme sex and violence', which is becoming quite common in many of today's vampire books.I'll certainly be giving it a second read in the future."
4,A Fine Vampire Anthology,"This is a pretty good vampire anthology, with a collection of stories that range from the ""fantastic! this is why I read these books!"" to ""really strange, but pretty good, I guess."" Some of the highlights were ""Before A Fall,"" ""Waiting for the 400,"" and ""The Alberscine Vigil."" A few others were not quite as good (""The Debauched One"" and ""On Line"" come to mind). The final story, ""For the Love of Vampires,"" wraps up this anthology nicely. The stories are all a good length, long enough to be fully developed, short enough to be still considered ""short stories."" All in all, I was quite satisfied with this collection."
1,"Dissapointing! Not ""provocative"" at all, OR erotic!",Yawn. I was expecting SO much more with the way the publisher advertises this book.Not nasty or erotic horror like I was expecting. Quite boring.
3,"Grab a copy , stump your friends, enjoy yourself","If the name Moonshine Hangover doesn't grab your attention, then this bracing, Southern fried set of tunes ought to do the trick. This group of Pacific Northwest (which surprised the hell out of me) rockers chugs reminds one of such icons as The Outlaws and The Marshall Tucker Band and even The Band but also should appeal to fans of contemporary groups such as the Gourds, Drive-by Truckers, or the late Shiners.The whiskey sodden, twisted songs about murder, love, drinking, and life off the paved roads may not break new ground, but it likely will compel listens to turn up the volume. Grab a copy of ""Thicket"", stump your friends, enjoy yourself.For the record, ""Thicket"" flirts with four stars but it certainly is a solid three."
2,Funny to those w/ little sense of humor,"Simply put, this is not very funny, though I guess there are a few people in this world who still think GILLIGAN'S ISLAND is one of the highpoints of comedy. As do Limbaugh and that guy who wrote the EAT THE RICH book (as if he were in Swift's league as a writer!), Shanklin confirms for me that not only are conservatives not funny, they are truly meanspirited, banal, boring, and forgettable. Those who want to laugh at some music should go get an old Tom Lehrer record."
2,"The design is good, the material not....","I tested a friends foot roller and I loved it. Very relaxing and perfect for home and office.I looked around and found this one. It has the same design as other foot rollers but the material is very cheap and fragile. The rubber over the rolls is a joke - comes easily off and is not durable.The wooden sticks which the rolls are attached to are super-thin. No wonder my roller arrived damaged (two rubber rings had cracks and one wooden stick was broken).You can find better foot rollers out there - this is overpriced garbage. The seller gets this for 5,- USD in China."
4,Good Foot Massage,"Good item to keep by my desk and use on a regular basis.Its a little harsh if you don't have socks on - but gives a good and even massage.Only issue is that the little rubber nubs can slide off if you don't use it in a fairly straight run... but after changing the angle of my foot, this has been fine...."
4,Silent Watch winder,"This watch winder is a good one that is extremely quiet--I can't hear anything as it rotates my watches. It has 4 winders and 2 holders for non-winding watches. Also has a draw on the bottom for extra watches not needing winding. The only draw back is that the case is big thus hard to place on a dresser or shelf. I have mine on the floor against the wall. It's about 12"" high and 14"" deep--go imagine."
2,Name plate on item!,"I was pleased to see a nicely finished watch winder. However, to my surprise, there is a large ""Tech Swiss"" emblem right on the lid to the winder! This is very ugly and ruins the overall look of the winder. Unfortunately it can not be removed without damaging the wood. This is NOT shown in photograph. The winder appears to work well and is very quiet. However, the large silver ""Tech Swiss"" name plate affixed to the top of the winder was unexpected and takes away from the overall appearance of the item."
2,Nice but there are no instructions,"Very nice finish, its so silent you cant hear ir... But lacks of an instructions booklet, I tried writting the seller but he just ignored me. Its obious the function of the 4 buttons above but what about the other 8 buttons?? I know that they are for programing the timing of the winder, but I dont have time to guess"
1,Bad Deal,"This DVD actually contains three movies that are available on other DVD's. They don't actually tell you what's on this DVD just that it's a John Wayne DVD and make it sound like something that it isn't available elsewhere. Actually it contains these three Wayne movies: The Man From Utah, Lucky Texan & The Star Packer."
3,Another Disappointment!,"This is another edition in The Young Duke Series that contains3 colorized John Wayne westerns from the 1930's. The movies have been drastically edited for time and retitled (although the original titles are given in parenthesis). The colorization is great, so I don't understand why they would want to go and ruin a good thing by cutting so much out of the movies. Even if you had never seen the original B&W; versions, you could still tell that something is missing from the movie. However, if you'd just like to see the ""young"" Duke in color, it might be worth the price."
3,Scandanavian police drama,"An interesting detective mystery that follows the investigation of a murdered police official. As the investigation unfolds numerous facts come to light about the life of the victim and the impact he had on those who served with him and those who were unfortunate enough to be his victims. The roof top stand off is intense, but not over done. The ending is abrupt. I expected a final closing scene with the usuall dialog summing up the tragedy, but there was none."
2,Not What I Was Looking For,"There was far too much analysis of Steinbeck's novels... and not enough about the man. The author seems to have appropriated a great deal of his material from ""Steinbeck: A Life In Letters,"" which I just read. It was that particular book that left me wanting for more, hoping to fill in some of the blanks. This book did a little bit, but really I did not gain much insight into John Steinbeck. Disappointing."
2,Great author - poor biography,"I am a big John Steinbeck fan. I was hoping for a biography to help me understand the man a little more. What I got was a critique of his writings. The author took great enjoyment in showing how he interpreted the Steinbeck writings. Hey, we have read the books and can form our own opinions! The biography was so long-winded that I found myself skipping entire sections. So, I was disappointed that the book was not a true biography of the man. The biography is in there, you just have to muddle through the author's side tracks to see it. I don't know of another biography to recommend since this is the first I tried, spurred on by the glowing reviews. Maybe I missed something and it is a great biography, but not for me personally."
4,Terrifically insightful,"There's no doubt Parini is an excellent writer. He's proven that on numerous occasions. But the Steinbeck autobiography proves he is also an excellent researcher and distiller of information. Steinbeck has been one of my favorite writers for years, and, as stated within his preface, he is one of Parini's favorites as well. Parini's admiration for Steinbeck comes across, as he details the many periods of Steinbeck's life, such as the Depression years, the war correspondence days, and the latter novels, such as The Winter of Our Discontent and Travels with Charley. Of particular interest within this biography is Parini's exploration of Steinbeck's psychological background and why he includes so many strong female characters within his novels."
5,A must have!,"This books serves as an excellent teaching tool and all around great resource for Photoshop users of any level. It's well structured, with easy to understand content. What I like the most is that the book is filled with full color images and screen shots for easy reference. It's very hands on. Excellent value for the price."
5,Exceptional Quality from Expert Teacher,"Colin does it yet again... Although this book at first glance appears targeted at beginners to the software, Colin steps things up a few notches by delivering sound information and quality techniques that intermediate and even advanced users of Photoshop will find useful and informative. Colin is not only an exceptional teacher of all things 'graphic', but check out his forum and website at www.photoshopcafe.com and you will find he is a heck of a nice guy to boot. 4000+ members to his forum alone can't be wrong!"
4,A great way to learn,"The below review was written by someone who clearly does not value good advice.I learned abotu so many features in photoshop, that I would have probably never ever explored! Really gives you insight to things you never thought neccesary.You don't need images to have this book teach you, the instruction is perfect as is."
1,i haven't got it yet,it has been over a month now and i still have not gotten my book. its amazing how you can buy a book and not get it for no real reason at all.
2,I expected more,"First of all, I thought this DVD was going to be recent. I guess I misunderstood when www.Amazon.com said it would be available February 21, 2003. However, they had trouble obtaining the DVD, so I had to order through ebay. I would say the concert in the DVD takes place in 1987. Right after his ""Dancing on the Ceiling"" album. Everybody looks 80ish. The quality isnt that great either and the special effects are cheesy. I also think the piano playing the songs by itself is cheesy and disappointing. I would much rather see Richie play ""Hello"" and ""Truly"" than some fancy piano. Unless you are a die hard Lionel Richie fan, I wouldn't suggest this 60 minute music DVD."
2,lionel richie the Outrageous Tour DVD,"Very disappointing.I preordered this. Lionel Richie's face of year 2003 on the cover and yet the concert was from the 80s. 3 songs were started in the middle of the song and ruined them totally. ej. Hello and Truly. I thought this was the new 2002/2003 tour and it was not. The DVD quality was good, but the performance not what I expected. I own many concerts on DVD and this is one of the worst. I could not get through it without skipping and skipping. fantastic performer since I saw him live. This never should have been released."
3,Very dated but still has some magic moments.,"This DVD, as you would know by now, is sometime in the eighties. I remember attending the same tour that this concert is from and just totally loving the show. Here we have a concert with all the songs of the early Richie times, but the let down is the picture quality is poor. Or perhaps I should say, not that great. If you're expecting quality, don't look here. If you want a record of the tour - then buy it. You'll probably watch it once, maybe twice, but that's it."
2,"The show is great, the quality is poor","The show was registered in 1987 in Rotterdam and sold as a VHS-tape. The DVD is simply a copy of this tape. The sound quality is with my surround equipment better as on the tape, whereas the video signal is worse. However I still enjoy the show very much and I am glad I bought the DVD. There is no region code, so the DVD should play anywhere (the television screen should be able to show NTSC)."
1,Poor quality for DVD label,"I am a great fan of Lionel Richie. He is one of the best singer that is why I collect his music cds and watch his concert in Hawaii last Feb.2003 and as soon as I saw his Outrageous live performance on DVD I bought it right away at SunCoast, when I watch it, the sound and video was poor in quality, in my observations, the DVD is like from the VHS tapes that was transfer to DVD and the sound was not stable in my High Fidelity system, I keep adjusting the bass and treble to have a good quality sound. The picture of Lionel Richie on the menu screen looks current but the concert seems to me sometime in the late 1980's. Overall the publisher of this import DVD is misleading the fans of Lionel Richie."
1,Bootleg,This was never released legally as a dvd. Only on vhs which means this is a copy and that is why the quality is so bad. I cannot believe bootleg copies are available on this site. It is a shame. Unless this is removed from the site I will no longer promote this site or purchase items from it. A Real DVD is being released by Lionel with never before seen videos. It should have the quality we are all looking for. Whoever is selling this copy from the vhs is stealing the music from a previously released vhs and tape and isn't that illegal? Please don't support bootleggers it hurts the artists.
5,The Poetry of Science,"This book is an example that science can indeed be very poetic and beautiful, and not need to be dull and boring. It is a joy to read, and I learned more about entropy reading this book than I did during my five years at the university. Highly recommended!"
3,Bashnent Granny,This movie has humor and laughter but do to the dialect you have to listen closely. Some parts of the play you kind of know what's being said. I purchased so many plays and movies that you just kind of know. Play good for laughter.
3,Incra Miter 1000se,The Incra Miter 1000se appears to function as advertised. the problem was in the packing and UPS. UPS deliverd the miter by droping the box over my five foot gate. This caused a knob to be broken along with a few other minor problems. The product was not packed very well. The only filler in the shipping box was some brown paper. This did not cushion the fall.
3,A bit disappointed,"Although I have only used it a few times, I am not enamored with the ""precise and extreme accuracy"" claims. In my hobby work, I need to cut various compound angles to 1/10 degrees. To do this, it is still necessary to use a digital protractor.So, a good straight edge miter gauge would have sufficed."
3,somewhat dissapointed,The metal fence does not sit at a 90 degree angle with the saw top. There seems to be about a 3 or 4 degree angle at the top of the fence. It makes me wonder if the produce is a factory second.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007UQ2EQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img
4,MITER1000SE,"Seriuosly guys, for the price you can't beat it. If you set it up right the first time, it's very accurate. Be carefull when ordering...there are a lot of different groove sizes out there. Just because it says it will fit your application, measure carefully!!! I had to have some machine work done due to my stupidity. It fit's like a glove now and very smooth, adaptable to table saw, band saw and sanders."
5,Incra Miter1000SE,"I like this product. The directions were a bit hard to follow, there had been some changes to the product since they were written. There were some updated sheets for some of the changes, but not all, so it was somewhat confusing, but not impossible to figure out. The product was shipped to me in a timely fashion. The Incra Miter1000SE works as advertised, I'm very pleased with it, it's a big improvement over the stock miter gauge that came with my table saw."
5,Pretty handy,"Beats the heck out of stock miter gauges, extendable, check out their rulers and squares, too. I like this size better than their 3000, this is much more manageable unless you're mitering huge panels. The Jess-em looks to be a good choice as well."
4,Incra miter gauge -telescoping,"Order received fairly quickly. Box was a bit tattered but product was fine. Looks like a useful tool, but also somewhat of a pain to set up properly. I am not highly experienced at this, so maybe others would have no problems."
4,The greatest review ever!!,"Nice gauge. Easy to assemble and calibrate. Constructed very well and should serve many moons. One drawback for me is that it is very heavy around the handle and with me trying to use this with a portable table saw it is really too big. My saw does not have the T-slot gauge so if I try to cut wide boards the gauge wants to come out of the slot. Not the fault of the gauge, just my small table saw. If you are using with a small saw you may want to order the gauge without the fence. The good news is this gives me an excuse to purchase a larger table saw."
5,Well worth the $$,"This is made very well easy to use and is DEAD ON !! I make mostly musical insterments and for me this was a must have. The nylon cams in the miter bar take out ALL the slop in the saw miter channel. Once you have and use this you see how poor the gauge that comes with your saw really is. If anything ever happened to this, I would replace it tomorow!!"
4,I like it but it could be better.,"I only have one complaint and I think others have voiced the same thing. The top of the miter gauge that the fence screws onto is not at a perfect 90 degree angle. I had to put strips of masking tape on the miter gauge to correct the fence. What good is cutting any angle if the piece you are cutting is not resting at a perfect 90 degrees going into the saw blade? This is a serious issue I think Incra needs to address. Other than that, and the instructions not being for that particular model, it does a very good job. If you want cuts with minimal tear-out just put a piece of masking tape on the back of the cut."
5,Excellent upgrade and value,"First off, thanks to Amazon I was able to get this miter gauge about $55 cheaper than most woodworking webpages. At first I was intimidated by the gauge but have become comfortable with it. It is very easy to move the fence for something like an angled cut and then re-square it with the blade. (I will say that I didn't realize that when you set the fence up for a 90 deg cut you can't cut some angles without moving the fence or it will go into the blade) This is all done with one or two allen bolts. After doing the initial calibration of the rulers I am comfortable that where I put the flip stop will correlate to the correct length. Adjustment of the bar in the miter slot makes for a slop free slide. The kit also came with a bunch of spare washers, bolts and even measuring tape. This is an awesome deal on Amazon...add it to your cart and watch the price fluctuation over a period of time. One morning I just jumped on it!"
5,The Best.,All I have to say this miter Gage is the best. After assembly and fitting the miter track to my miter slot. By the way is fits snug. No play left or right what so ever. Out of the box the fence was 90 deg to my blade. I made a test cut just to see and my digital protractor said 90.1. For me that is good enough. Setting the scale to read true was a little trouble. But after playing with it for a while I figured it out. The angle cuts are also dead on. If you need a 45 deg cut it cuts 45 every time. And the flip stop repeat a cut stop block is amazing. I have no need for a cross cut sled any longer. What an amazing tool.
5,A great miter gauge,After having an accident when a cheap miter gauge broke I upgraded to this one. It works great. I love the fact that the angle is double locking for added safety. It is very accurate and can be adjusted to fit perfectly in the miter slot.
5,Good Value,"This is an excellant miter guage and a great value for the price paid through Amazon. I'm a woodworker hobbyist and this guage will serve my purposes well. It set up relatively easy with the exception of the final step of setting the guage 90 degrees to the saw fence. This is important because if this is off, every setting will be off. I think that the inexpensive referencing square that I used was off a little. Using trial and error, I got it very close but I should probably get a good referencing square to finalize the setting. I also like the extending fence."
1,Terrible,I thought that this book was absolutely terrible. I had the hardest time trying to comprehend what was going on. I did not enjoy it at all. I would not recomend it to anyone either. I would not even give it one star. It is not worthy of it.
4,Excelente Introduccion a las costumbres biblicas,Este es uno de los mejores libros con relacion a las costumbres y trandiciones en los tiempo biblicos. Todo creyentes y/o estudioso de las Escrituras deberia tener una copia de este libro.
5,Me encanta!,Este libro me encanta. Si usted quiere saber mas acerca de las tradiciones de la biblia usted debe tener este libro. Lo recomiendo total mente.
2,Shocked!,"I have waited so many years to read an author as thrilling, hilarious, and intelligent as Reginald Hill. I have read many other books in this series and have been completely satisfied. That's why I was ASTOUNDED at how utterly BORING this was. The last fifty pages or so I actually skimmed, praying for the end to come. If this was the first Reginald Hill book I picked up, it would have without doubt never read him again, which would have been a great loss. I recommend skipping this book entirely, but give the others a chance, as they are quite good."
2,Good book buried in there somewhere,"I'm not a huge fan of Mr. Hill, finding his books to be good detective stories buried under an increasing amount of silly self-important schoolboy purple prose. And this book was my final goodbye to his work. After a few chapters, I started skipping whole pages. Then after a while, I just put the book down forever. So, can't spoil the plot for you-- if it has one-- I've no idea what finally happened. But, there were the bones of a good story in there, but not worth the slog for me."
4,Still writing for readers,"The latest from Reginald Hill. He's managed to avoid the trap of seeing everything throught the prism of the television series and is still writing for readers. The novel is a complex weaving of a number of different threads and contains a delightful story within a story written by Ellie Pascoe. Although the central male characters are not so much of a presence in the main story their characters are transmuted to the characters in Ellie's stories so readers can still get their fix of the banter between ""Dalziel and Pascoe"". In the manner of many writers of series novels Hill is obviously becoming more interested in the characters themselves rather than the crime and that is where the focus of this book is. Echoes exist from the previous novel in the series but it is not necessary to have read it to enjoy this book. Which I certainly did."
2,Disappointing,"I enjoy Reginald Hill and I have liked every other Dalziel/Pascoe mystery, but this one disappointed me. The plot here seemed very obvious and why has Weild been elevated to sainthood? I will certainly read Hill's next book, but Ellie needs to take a long writer's vacation to the Lake Country and Dalziel needs to come back front and center."
2,An uncharacteristically ill-plotted outing for Hill,"As Francis Jeffrey once said: this will never do. Although Hill should be commended for his willingness to take formal risks in his prose, this novel suffers on several fronts. Readers who dislike Ellie Pascoe will not be won over here, although DC Shirley Novello continues to charm. The hodgepodge plot is strangely hard to follow, and matters are not helped by that annoying mock-epic--which, if it represents Ellie's writing prowess, inadvertently explains why she has had a hard time selling her novel. Dalziel, Pascoe, and Wield are all their usually well-characterized selves, and the insane(?) commentator is rather interesting. But one subplot caveat. While Hill has made Wield's personal development over the last few novels clearly dependent on his love affair with bookdealer Edwin Digweed, he has yet to make the relationship seem realistic: the ""Odd Couple"" jokiness constantly makes the reader wonder what, exactly, they see in each other."
2,Convoluted,"Disjointed, convoluted, erratic--all come as a disappointment to Reginald Hill's fans who read this book thinking they are lapping up another Dalziel/Pascoe story. Perseverance will get the reader to the end of the book, with a ""what's new"" shrug of the sholders, and a feeling that Hill was impressed with his own cuteness and, as one reviewer says, ""erudition"". While obviously a side trip from the usual, this story needs to go back to the editor for tuning up. Disappointing!"
2,"Come, come! Call a twit a twit!","Reginald Hill is no Ruth Rendell. His plotting is too transparent and his characterizations too predictable. But worst of all, there are too many coincidences. P.S.--That dreadful book-within-a-book, all in italics, could have been cut to good effect."
3,Front cover ruined this for me,"I have now returned two of these albums because of bubbling under the sticker on the front cover of the album. The picture shown online is of the box the album comes in--not the actual album. The album is a lovely sage green leather-like hardback but has a large sticker on the front with the same picture seen on the box. Overall, I love this album, and I am really upset that the bubbling bothers me so much. I thought if I gave it some time, I would learn to ignore it, but it's just too noticeable to me. Plus, I'm worried what it will look like years from now. Aside from the bubbling, the album is great--very colorful and not as overwhelming as some I've seen."
4,cute baby book,"This book has just the right amount of prompting, blank space and cute illustrations. I prefer loose leaf, but this book is nice & compact. Also, it is less cheesy than other books like this. On the down-side, the sticker on the front looks a little cheap."
4,Liked this memory book,"This is a good baby record book, i have this additional to one more book which is just for the first year... so i liked it.. i am not sure if this book covers everything if its the only book you will be getting for your baby.."
3,Good for 3 years,"I bought it for my daughter,it contains more pages from 1 to 3 years.After that very less.I recommend this to buy."
4,They forged in the smithy of their hearts the uncreated conscience of their race,"This is an essentially sympathetic if not uncritical presentation of three of the most important English- language Irish writers, Shaw, Yeats, and Joyce. The language and thought are complicated, and often difficult to understand. But there is displayed a sure knowledge of the work and life of the three masters. I found especially interesting the analysis of Yeats who is presented as having elaborated a whole world of hermetic and symbolic thought primarily as means to creation of poetry. Shaw and Yeats are seen as essentially shy and withdrawn figures who wear public masks. Joyce is clearly understood as the overarching figure of the three who puts Dublin and Ireland on the world literary map in a way no one had done before."
1,Skip this one...,"I bought this audio book with the expectation of a history of the development of the game, as the title would suggest. Which is what I recieved on the first CD. The second CD, however, is about the development -- or lack thereof -- of ice hockey in Great Britain. Also, there are only the two CD's, in packaging and at a price that would suggest four CD's. I was very underwhelmed, and would never recommend this selection to anyone."
5,Spice & Wolf: Complete Series (Blu-ray/DVD Combo),"This is one of the finest anime I have ever seen. It has great character development and plot. I would encourage those who haven't seen the show to buy the set, it is worth it."
3,Nostalgia for the old way,"Not really so much a fan of a merchant that travels around europe, but it has its moments of clarity that defines relationships, and the complications women endure in there heads, but I do not understand that a wolf god can feel like a spoiled, snotty little girl. It was very boring, and I wanted to get through it, so I put it on in the back ground of what I was doing."
1,Horrible,"As a fan of horseracing and video games, I was very excited to see a game like this being marketed. I've played Gallop Racer and G! Jockey, and liked them both. The way this game was marketed, I thought it would be the eqivalent of Madden or 2K sports to horseracing. I was wrong. It plays terrible. It plays like a game from Atari, it is so bad. The races are ridiculous, you can go from 1st to last to 1st again. And in between races, you have to do all sorts of boring things to get to the next race. I think they wanted the player to concentrate on handicapping and betting to try and win over new racetrack converts. Maybe they will do that, but if you're looking for a good horseracing video game to play, this isn't it. Save your money, I traded mine in within a few days, this game was so bad"
3,"""Impressive"" NOT","My dad got me this game for Valentine's day. I was SOOO excided, But when I started to play, it was boring. The races were too easy, and the stable part is comfusing. You have to claim your horse and you can't even groom it!! I didn't want to hurt my dad's feelings, so I said the racing part was fun."
2,G1 and GR junkie...,"I picked this up second-hand as my first race game (it was the first one I saw, before I knew G1J and Gallop Racer existed) and it wound up being an ok introduction. Yes the overall construct and presentation could be better, but if you want an inexpensive option to see if you might like a Horse race game then this one is the way to go. Good opportunity to learn the basics of the controls and get a sense of what the other (better!) games are like, and if you totally hate it you're not out all that much (only a couple US$ on Amazon as I write this) - just don't expect too much as it is grossly outclassed by Gallop Racer, Grade 1 Jockey, and the new Champion Jockey."
3,"good concept, bad game","i recently purchased breeder's cup and although it may be liked by some, i can't advise it. limited gameplay, and limited graphics make this title boring. a great value if you are a die hard horse racing fan, but i found the racing dynamics easily exploitable and the overall feel of the game to be repetitive. looks good on the shelf. liked the gambling aspect of the game and found it to be the most fun. really fun with a friend and some friendly wagers."
5,Horse lover's buy this game.,This game is awesome. But i warn you only buy it if you are a horse lover and also love horse racing.
1,Big Disappointment,"I was anxiously awaiting the release of this game assuming that since the NTRA was involved it would be a top notch product. All they had to do was take Gallop Racer and make it better. What a disappointment.The first time I played I was able to win a race right away. There was no challenge to it whatsoever. The tracks are far from interesting and not at all representative of the real location. Several times I chose to run a dirt race and all but one of the horses entered preferred the turf. Pick the horse that likes the dirt and you win - duh. Graphics are mediocre at best and you get no sense of the racing experience like in Gallop Racer.Looks like the racing industry can't even get a video game right, let alone solve their other issues. Save your $$$ and stick with Gallop Racer."
1,Horrible,"I found this game on a shelf at a store, and thought it looked ok for my daughter. I brought it home and on the first day she had won almost all the stake cups, had over $10.5 million in the career mode, and had all the legends unlocked. This game is horrible, it is absolutely horrible. The NTRA should have done a whole lot better on this game."
3,Not that bad,"This game is okay. I mean, Gallop racer is a million times better. But this gam is kinda cool. But when you breed horses , they are either 2 or 3 years old.And you can't breed YOUR horses. You breed someone elses. Plus, your horse injures itself AL OF THE TIME!!! It drives me crazy."
2,Not Really...,"This book had very little useful information for me, a person who's interested in starting his own, personal website that offers a few items or services commercially. Instead, the book tends to wallow in the pop-psychology of ""doing business on the Internet."" For instance, the author talks about the anxieties some folks (potential customers) have about making electronic purchases on the web... repeatedly... and ends up using a significant portion of the book to express what could just as effectively have been written in a paragraph or two."
2,for the absolute beginner,"This book has almost no useful information for anyone with the slightest familiarity with a computer and the internet. By virtue of its title, I thought I was going to learn the basic nuts and bolts of setting up my own business website. Instead it's only advice was to hire a professional to do it."
1,How to start a business website,"This book should be named ""Why to Start a Business Website"" I am very disapointed. Example: Chapter 6 ""Building Your Website"" basically says hire a website designer and what qualifications that person should have. Thanks for that info., but isn't that common sense! Overall I think this book is fluff writen by someone who is not interested in helping an individual start a website."
2,"If re-written, might satisfy a TOTAL novice","I bought this book a couple of years ago and read it in early 2002. My disappointment was due in large part (I thought) to developments in the industry since publication. But I notice that it's still the same edition being sold.Problems:1. Very superficial exploration of issues; does not in any way give you a thorough understanding of the subject2. Nor is it a ""how to"" guide.3. The dot com crash highlights the book's lack of objectivity - generally bullish on getting into a web business, but no strategic insight into how to sustain it.It may be OK for those with almost no knowledge of the internet *if* it is updated in a new edition. If, however, you keep up with the news and have delved far enough into Amazon to be able to read this review, then you don't need the book.Thank you Amazon for providing the ""look inside"" function which unfortunately did not exist when I bought Mr. Powers' book."
3,For absolute beginners,"I would say this book is for beginners, for those who have been online for some times, the materials is absolutely skin-depth. It just states the obvious and gives no inspiration for me after reading through."
5,SCULPEY LIQUID CLAY SOFTENER,THIS SOFTENER IS GREAT FOR ANY POLYMER CLAY ARTIST. I ONLY WISH IT CAME IN GREATER QUANTITIES ALTHOUGH THE SIZE IS CONVENIENT
3,good stuff,i start to use it on my polymer clay figures and i see it more clear and clean after using it on my works
1,"Unless you are a math major, skip this book","In ""Algorithm Development and Program Design Using C"", Bronson uses mathmatical formulas for nearly all the programming examples. Unless you have an extensive math background, the examples in this book are useless. The book is also wordy and long-winded, which makes the explanations of commands difficult to follow. I would not recommend this book for beginners."
4,What about Ronnie Lang?,"No credits, no plaudits for the man mentioned in my review title and I'm sure the soundtrack, specifically, and the movie, collectively, lose a significant portion of the overall luster without the gorgeous alto saxophone renderings of Ronnie Lang, whose solo work here over the recurring theme is nothing short of a masterpiece unto itself. Why do so many Hollywood ending credits jump at the chance to give ""props"" to the caterer, or the electrician trainee, or the third best boy, as examples, but make no mention whatsoever of the contributions of the stellar musicians, such as Ronnie, and the solid impact they make on the impetus of a given film? Bernard Herrman deservedly gets his ""props"", but his ""aces"" in the pit really take his score to a higher, more subliminal level.At any rate, my personal kudos go out to Ronnie and the other soloists and pitmen who flourish in their glorious musical interpretations!"
5,deep deep deep focused score,"Amazed when this arrived and I read the liner notes describing how composer Bernard Herman died in his sleep on the night he wrapped this recording. As my composition teacher told me, ""at least he died happy!"" Great music, thought-provoking and of the times."
4,It's just not complete without Jackson Browne,"If you really want to complete your Taxi Driver soundtrack, check out Jackson Browne's ""Late For The Sky"". The title track is the music for one of the most sublime scenes in the movie, where Travis is watching TV in his living room, just on the verge of madness. You need to hear the song in its entirety.If only the movie had a separate soundtrack - one with the original score, and one with the songs from the artists of the time."
4,Just what I wanted,"Found what I wanted in a band. And it happened to be just in my size. It meets all of the descriptions, I'm very pleased with this purchase."
5,It's more about wartime Germany than Christianity. Very interesting.,"I started reading this as I was interested in German life during the war. In this aspect it was full of very interesting information about how daily life went for typical Germans.The Christianity aspect of the book was there but didn't overpower the book at all. Actually, the book could have easily been published by a non-christian publisher as the story is more centered upon Hansi's life during (and then after) the war, with the religious aspect seeming to be just part of the story and not the entire story (which made the book that much more interesting)."
3,Cowsills Fans Only,"Though it contains their breakthrough hit (""The Rain, The Park, and Other Things"") and the elusive theme from ""Love American Style,"" only diehard fans of the family should pick this up, as most of the songs are not up to the quality of later hits. Good sound and interesting liner notes."
5,Outstanding!!,The songs are absolutely amazing and the jazz hits the soul. Excellent value for a great product!! A must buy for jazz fans!
1,No information in the booklet,The booklet has no information in it.I thought here would be more information a long with some photos of Indian items.A ripoff of money DON'T buy it
3,you could do worse,"three and a half stars...came across this one at a used bookstore and just started reading it ahead of the others i had on my list...at times, it reads like an anti-communist party document...i never realized so many blacks were actually involved in the party. it's this book that led me to read the crisis of the negro intellectual. i liked some of the speeches, but at times, it just seemed like wright spent too much time attacking things rather than just tell a good story, but when he tells the story, it is captivating...it was refreshing to see a black man who could outsmart the system, even if he didn't win in the end. oh well, such is life in america...."
4,Ivory Hunter,My mother has been searching for this artist for a while nowI'm happy with the packaging and the cd. I was anxious about buying a used CD but its in great condition
5,Innocence Sacrificed,"i really Love this book , loved her last one and am waitting for the next. this book captured my attention right away . It took me about a week to read it , i started and got through the first half , in a couple of days and when I was able to pick it up again i finished the last half of the book in an afternoon.THis is a great author and am looking forward to the next book. this would make a great movie ,I think a lot of people would watch it . the authors imagination comes alive in this book, not knowing what is going to happen next . each chapter brings a stunning surprise."
5,Constance Demby is back.,It is wonderful to have Ms. Demby move away from the atonal and morbid sounds of Attunement and Spirit Trance to the uplifting sounds she gave us in Novus Magnificat and Set Free. This is definitely one of her best works.
2,"Very predictable,repetitive","You always think that will make a turn at the next corner ,so to speak ,but it never does ,instead repeats the same theme with different variations,of voices to familiar.Not to Sanctum as I thought,sorry that i bought it."
3,"Fun, but not exceptional.","This book is a collection of articles published about the RE big twins (500 - 750). I had expected a comprehensive history, written by a knolwedgeable person, rather than a compendium of reproduced period articles. What is missing as any overall insights into the bikes, from which models or years had what kind of problems and strenths, to selecting a big twin and making it into a reliable modern-day daily rider, to any type of aggressive riding comparsion between it and any of its popular contemporaries (Norton twins, especially the 750/850 isolastic series, the later unit Triumph 650, unit BSA twins, etc.). It was enjoyable for what it was, but I felt the lack of any insight provided by an expert in 50s-60s British twins."
2,In Search of Mozart,"It is a bit ponderous. I ordered it for my AP English Language and Composition Class, and I am afraid that it will not be what they need to analyze it for Documentary as Rhetoric. While I can appreciate its beauty, they will probably be bored."
5,A Must for all Mozart lovers!,"This is the best documentary on Mozart yet produced. The musicians and performers are some of the world's very best. The film is well done and gives a real understanding of Mozart, his life and times. The musical excerpts are exceptional. Don't miss it!!"
5,In search of Mozart,"This is an outstanding DVD. Like its fellow production ""In search of Beethoven"", the DVD is a thoroughly researched documentary about the life and work of a musical genius. The production is intersperced with musical passages from Mozart's compositions which are performed by outstanding artists. Also there is commentary from musicologists who have studied the life and music of the composer. The effect of this commentary together with frequent flashes of the many excellent portraits of the composer makes one feel that he is a living presence."
5,Very in depth study of Mozart!,I enjoyed the detail that went into exploring the boy to the man.I also appreciated the story of his father.
5,Replacement,"Works great. I am glad these types of products are available through Amazon.com, and they are very easy to locate on your web site. Thank you"
2,Prenatal Yoga for beginners,"This DVD is good for pregnant women who have never done yoga before and are also in bad shape. If you have experience in Yoga or if you used to excercise regulary before your pregnancy, this DVD is not for you."
3,A somewhat helpful guide,I was a bit disappointed that the pictures and print were so small. It was an adequate guide to travel the city.
1,DO NOT BUY,Sloppy and hard to navigate. Gives you the sense that it was put together in haste. Terribly disappointing for an otherwise great travel guide company.
3,"Good book that details the the ""Old Boys"" Network","Overall this book provided great historical details into the mind of one of Investment Bankings greatest personalities. Andre Meyer's networking skills were 90% responsible for his success with the remaining 10% being attributable to his sheer tenacity.The book does drag in some spots, but the author definitely did his homework."
4,A good solid mystery,"I like the main character, Carlotta, and the story was one of those intricately woven ones - where all the little pieces eventually come together. If I say too much more I'll ruin the ending, which even came as a little bit of a surprise to me. Definitely a good read, especially if you like a little more action and suspense, but don't want all-out procedurals or gore. A step above a cozy, but still with a nice feel. This is the second book by Linda Barnes that I've read, and I think I might look into reading a few more. Definitely worth your time."
5,Ned Snell Easy Web pages,"This is an excellent book for someone who wants to use Front Page Express and create simple web pages. It is well laid out, has a good index, and is easy to understand. An excellent place to start creating web pages. freelandz28@mindspring.com"
2,Disappointing and out-dated,"This documentary doesn't have a whole lot to recommend it. Thin story line, fairly generic ""coming out"" situations, sluggish pace and incomplete story lines combine to make this film fall far short of its potential. The erotic material, by today's ""Queer as Folk"" standards, is remarkably tame (although one of the editors is attractive enough) and certainly doesn't feel ground-breaking. Worth renting, perhaps, but not worth buying, even at Amazon's generously reduced price."
5,An Intriguing Mission,The Stone Reader exemplifies a reader's passion for the written word. How many people these days get so caught up in a work of fiction that we turn into investigators to uncover more about the author? I was impressed with the film and the director's dedication to his interests and his craft.
1,From 2/14/04 NY Times on Scamming the System:,"As the Amazon sites expand their visitors are seen as an increasingly important. Mark Moskowitz, an independent filmmaker, sent an e-mail message to about 3,000 people this week asking them to review the DVD of his film ""Stone Reader,"" which goes on sale soon.""If you didn't see it but heard it was good, go ahead and post anyway, (what the heck),"" Mr. Moskowitz told them. ""It doesn't obligate you for anything, even the truth.""Not even the truth? I beg to differ. . ."
2,Unworthy?,"I happen not to be one of the 3,000 people who received an email from the director asking them to review the film in a positive way even if they have not seen it (according to an article in the New York Times and News.com).Therefore I can possibly give a more independent review.Unfortunately there are not many good things to say about this film. The plot is not well carried out, the characters are somewhat linear, there is a lack of proper balance in the way the story is told. There are many better things out there. For them 3,000 emails may not be necessary."
1,Appalling picture quality,This is the first DVD I ever returned for store credit. It's difficult towatch since the picture quality is so poor. The contrast seems very wrong and the colors are garish.
3,A True Tale Of Obsessive Love,... Yes this film can be slow as molasses but it also has some beautiful loving moments between writer Dow Mossman and director Mart Moskowitz whose obsessive love is evident to anyone no matter what your orientation.
5,A wonderful documentary for lovers of literature and cinema,"A well-crafted exploration of readers and writers, Mark Moskowitz's documentary has been appearing in myriad top-ten lists for 2003. It chronicles Moskowitz's attempts to locate the writer Dow Mossman and, en route, it calls upon a score of writers and former associates of Mossman. The success of the film is this journey, a celebration of why we read and why we write. It makes you want to go home and start reading immediately--maybe dust off one of those books you've been holding onto for years without having read. Some literary masterpieces may not strike us until we are ready to appreciate them. Moskowitz couldn't breach Mossman's book when he first bought it, but found himself lost in its poetic imagery much later in life. Fans of film and reading will love this documentary. Do yourself a favor and pick it up."
4,Ingenious Tracking of a Genius,"Stones of Summer has become a part of my understanding of the past as well as the present. I stayed up late to finish the book, but the next morning I was searching the internet to find out about the author. Fortunately, someone else had already been there and done that. This is his story. The journey to find Dow Mossman is intriguing, for it is a story in itself: the story of what happens to a great book, or what doesn't happen in this case. It is a fitting tribute to a brilliant young man who gave everything he had to interpret the senselessness of living."
2,A middling docuymentary I don't trust,"I consider myself an objective reviewer in regard to Stone Reader. I've seen it twice, once at a film festival in New York and once on DVD. I found it an average film, about 45 minutes too long. Much too much screentime was devoted to the director and his studied emptiness. As far as questions regarding whether this film has a latent gay message, I will not speculate. I will say that I liked some of the interviews with writers, but those were few and far between. As farfetched as I found the story, I suspended my disbelief. I accepted what I saw as truth.I have since watched the DVD and read the Times article about how the filmmaker sent out 3,000 e-mails requesting that people post postitive reviews on Amazon, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE ACTUALLY WATCHED THE FILM. I find this outrageous. Stone Reader may have fooled me, but many of its reviews here do not."
2,overlooked for a good reason,"i have never written one of these reviews on amazon before, but feel compelled to add my two cents. i saw this documentary last year at the overlooked film fest in chicago and walked out about 2/3 of the way through. in my opinion the film was much ado about nothing, though the puffed-up director evidently thought otherwise. i am writing now even though i am not one of the 3,000 people (as reported last week by the new york times) who received an e-mail from the director asking them to write a rave review of stone reader on amazon, even if they have not seen it. well, i saw it, and was not impressed. nor am i impressed by the underhanded e-mail campaign."
2,Get to the point,This movie is an convoluted look into one person's coming out experience. The movie brings out the personal and social stigmas of homosexuality. The viewer is able to feel the torment and pain that the director goes through as he reaches an understanding of what love and sex mean to his relationship with a writer.
4,flawed but fun film about writing and books,"Director-writer Mark Moskowitz picked up a 1972 novel, The Stones of Summer by Dow Mossman, and was so moved by it that he decided to try to find the author, who had never written another thing. His journey is meandering but the people he talks to -- professors, authors and editors -- are interesting. If you are a person who loves books and is interested in authors' stories, you will probably enjoy this film. Dvd extras include commentary by Moskowitz."
1,Lonnnnnnnnnnnnnnng,"This movie is a very, very long three hours. I disliked it not in a scolding way but because it induced boredom to the level of panic, a desire to flee the theater."
3,Self-indulgent? Yes. Homosexual? No.,"I have no idea where these people come up with this stuff, but to insinuate that there are homoerotic undertones in this film is to lay bare one of the most unsophisiticated interpretations I've ever read. I shake my head in visceral astonishment at the utter profundity of several of these reviewer's stupidity. Truly.Anyway, the story behind the film is interesting. Unfortunately, the filmmaker, at some point, decided the story wasn't good enough and basically made a home movie of his quest without much thought as to why he was doing this or if perhaps his brazen (sometimes rude) approach would translate well onto the screen (it didn't).All that said, it's better than 95% of the crap out there right now. Perhaps that isn't saying much."
1,I've changed my mind,"I had originally given Stone Reader a positive review despite reservations about the director's dubious 'search' for a missing novelist and his annoying attempts to upstage the publishing people he interviews. What changed my mind was a recent newspaper story about how he sent our thousands of e-mails begging others to leave favorable reviews at amazon.com, even if they had never seen the movie. Trickery of this sort lowers my opinion of both the director and his film. Neither is worthy of our consideration."
5,Something for everyone,"I enjoyed this movie so much that I now often have friends over so I can get the thrill of their reaction. The results after many such sessions are in: everyone loves this movie. There really is something for everyone. It's a great mystery, a documentary about writing, a love story about reading, a journey, a beautifully photographed work, thought provoking in a way that makes you want to speak to others . . . anyway, you get the idea.Oh, one more thing, it makes a wonderful gift for anyone who loves to read, no make that knows how to read. (Can I give this movie 6 stars?)"
3,A romantic fantasy for mature souls.,"A director deals with his gay feelings for a writer in a repressive social/class system. This warm, wonderful film taps into the universal emotional drives for family, longing and a place to call home."
4,A wonderful exploration of novels and their impact,"""Stone Reader"" was one of my favorite documentaries of 2003.Salinger's Holden Caulfied says something to the effect that you know that a book is truly great when you wish the author were a friend so that you could call him up and quiz him on the details of the story. Mark Moskowitz clearly felt that Dow Mossman's ""Stones of Summer"" was a novel of that stature and so didn't give up on his quest until he could have those conversations for himself.I found Moskowitz's passion and some of his discoveries along the way interesting and in some cases, quite moving. (Whether or not the book ""Stones of Summer"" is any good is an entirely separate issue for me.)There are some very strange things going on with the reviews down below, which I won't bother commenting on except to say that some folks have clearly decided to try to impact this film negatively in a way that bewilders me."
2,I got no sense of the book,"I saw this movie last year and was disappointed. I was left with no sense of the book Stones Of Summer or how it was written, etc. I left a posting on a movie website saying this and the next day got a meanspirited response from another viewer who amazingly turned out to be the director. I found this out by checking the poster's website profile. He wrote ""Well, I saw it too. a few weeks ago, and it was clear from the outset to me that the movie wasn't about the book, but more about all/any books and we/audience feel about them. Only movie I've been to where audience spontaneously applauded at end. A great movie. Left me thinking about it for days. Empty? Hmmmm.....yes, if you expected a book report i suppose. thank god it wasn't."""
4,For book lovers and indie fans,"What I like most about this doc is that it celebrated something that I love - books. As an avid reader since I could read, it was fun for me to go on this journey in search of an author. After seeing the movie, I bought the book. I haven't read it yet, so I dont' know yet whether I'll share Mark's enthusiasm for the book - but I guess that would be another revew.I also read some of the other reviews and a few of them puzzle me. A couple mention the ""staged"" nature of some of the events. You think Ken Burns never stages anything? You've never seen re-creations in a documentary? It's a standard storytelling technique so I don't see why some make it a big issue.Overall, the movie kept my interest until the very end and I was expecially pleased to find out the happy ending the film created for the author."
3,The Lone Ranger and Tonto,"This documentary is too long by half and a structural shambles, but the gay subtext is fascinating. The male director, an ostensibly married man who lives in a homiosocial world as virile as Robert Bly's, becomes enamored of a lost male novelist he has never met.He searches obsessively for him, eventually finds him, and, in the closing frames, walks off with him into the sunset. The only woman allowed a speaking part is the director's yenta mother. The director's ""wife"" will only allow her feet to be shown.One could debate the sexual orientation of the director, but not his obsessive devotion to the writer."
2,Too much fat and gristle,"This documentary is like a filet mignon that's been cut by a blind butcher. You get a lot of fat and gristle but not much meat. The meat is there, but the director has no clue where. You lose your appetite with all that fat, i.e the director's dull, meandering search for an A.W.O.L. writer. The gristle is the witless, self-absorbed personal story that leaves you wondering why the director bothered going through the motions. The meat is the interviews with publishing types. To get to it, the butcher makes you chew on indigestible scraps.Really folks I've had better meals at Dennys."
1,Fruitcake special,"One of the problems I have with this movie is its focus on sexual preference. Are viewers not supposed to care about anything else besides readers and their homosexuality? Because I do.Also, the relationship between Moskowitz and Mossman is a perpetually bizarre one. Despite how uncomfortable he sometimes becomes when in Mossman's presence, Moskowitz cannot keep himself away. I found it quite unbelievable.Lastly, this movie is incredibly monotonous. Nothing really interesting occurs until the last thirty minutes."
4,Another good book from Friends of Ed,"I bought it last year but it was a little outdated and unnecessary complicated when explaining how to get PHP/Apache/MySQL installed.I consider myself an experienced user but that part of the book dissapointed me.What I love about FOED books is that they develop an entire application and guides you step by step. Their books are my choice NO. 1!Of course, this book is now a little outdated and would recommend to buy the new ones."
5,Clear and creative,This book is an excellent starting point for anyone who has only just got to grips with other dreamweaver versions. It gives clear but creative information in a way that is easy to follow. It's very well written and gives some good examples
4,"Good Book, However.......","Martin Elliott has written a good book here, but the buyer should be aware that there are some inaccuracies in his tome.I would purchase this book again in spite of the few errors made by the author."
2,Not fit as good as color gray,Smaller than expected. But gray color fits very well. Buy the gray color onlyDon't know why Hane's will have this quality
2,Material too thin,The material is way too thin! The elastic band for the waist has virtually no elasticity and the pants can simply fall off.
4,good product for the price!,"Good quality and good price! The fabric is thin, however it is suitable to wear at -10C degrees as i used it."
1,I just bought two Hanes Thermal Pants and these were broken.,I just bought two Hanes Thermal Pants and these were broken. Unfortunately I am from another country and I could not be able to change the product. Now I am sure I have lost my money.
5,good,I brought three of these shirts in different colors with pants. I borught them bigger because the reviews said they run small. Well I gotta say that mine fit a little big but is very comfortable. No tears or rips and they keep me warm too. I'm big and tall and finding these in my size in the store was impossible and i am so glad I brought these and will buy more next year.
4,Nicely fitted thermals,"The Hanes Thermals are a better quality than the ones I've bought on sale at Target and the same price. They fit well; I wear them under my sweats in our Southern California winter! I know, poor me. - I didn't give them a five because the comparable Hanes Duofold are even more comfy, warmer, etc. Buy those!"
5,perfect,These are a good quality product and just perfect to keep your bottom half warm. I highly recommend these thermal pants
4,Good value,keeps my legs nice and warm through out the day. Going to buy an other pair in a different color.
4,Warmth,Make sure you order one size smaller than you actually are. these are like sleeping bags. I love them though.
2,Misleading picture,"I got the natural color ones, to my surprise they are not like they are shown in the picture, the waist is really high , up to above my belly button! really old old style.."
5,What a Bargain,"I got tired of my husband wearing his pajama bottoms under his work pants to work in the winter, so I bought these. He loves them, and no more nasty pajama bottoms in my household! Can't tell what's irregular about them."
3,Not as thick as I expected.,Would not recomend for extreme cold temperatures. Had this under my work pants in approximately 30 degree weather and my legs were still cold.
3,Great for some time,"The thermal pants were perfect for a time, but they broke at the 5th time they were washed ...not that resistent"
3,fits good,This are just enough. No big wonder noir a mistake. This keep warm your under body. Standar quality. If you get it for a few dollars is a nice deal.
1,Worst I've had,First day I used them they tore along one of the seems. I didnt believe it was a tear when I first saw it. I went to touch the tear and it tore so easily about 8 more inches. Easier than tearing paper.I would not recommend this to anyone. Not even worth shipping it back to seller.
4,good value,They fit my husband well and they are warm without bring to heavy and bulky. Good value for the price.
1,Waste of money,"Bought 2 pairs of Hanes Thermal Pants about a month ago. I work outdoors and frequently on the move. After only 1 month of wear,both pair are ripping and falling apart. Very poor quality."
1,Very Flimsy,"My husband got these pants for a fishing trip. They ripped, as he was pulling them up to put them on for the first time.In general I like the Hanes brand but these are terrible, way too thin, flimsy and a waste of money."
1,Do not buy - utterly worthless,"I took a chance on these... and it wasn't worth it. Like the other reviews stated, the legs split on the inside seam. I bought three pairs, and the first pair split as soon as I put my leg in (and I have thin legs for a guy!).I'd strongly advise staying away."
2,"Sub-par Quality, could have been a fluke","Size was a little large for large, but not by much. Unfortunately, they fell apart after the first wash with a seam separation on one of the legs. Amazon was great with the return, and it's possible this was just a rough in the rough. If the material had held up, I certainly would have kept it."
4,Took Too Long To Ship,"Took me longer to receive this than many items I buy from Amazon but the product is good, worth the wait and price."
2,Did anExperiment,"I bought these and Carharts, wore them both, 40 degree weather, these won. Waiting for them to come out of the wash to see if they shrunk, maybe i'll come back and let you know. Forget the Hanes.I like the Carharts so much I came back and bought the crew shirt. You do get what you pay for in this case.I'm 6 foot 38-40 waist, Carharts- bought xl regular fit good, again did not try them out of the wash yetxl regular crew as well fit goodBack_ tried them out of the washer and dryer still fit good, I still like them"
2,it came with a hole!,"I don't recommend this product, the elastics are to tight and its very difficult to put in. then, it came with a hole and taking it off for the first time, it get another hole..."
2,seam came apart,"I ordered two pair. The good - warm, comfortable as promised. The bad - seam came apart first time I wore them. The second pair fine for now. I resewed the first, and perhaps this was an exception, but disappointing."
4,love this color,I bought this color so it wouldn't be so obvious under other clothing at the ankle. They are thin enough to wear indoors but warm enough to use for outside.
2,thermal pants,it not stretchable and its a kind of uncomfortable i should return it but i open them already will not buy this again
4,Great men's thermals,"These thermals are lightweight but warm. Great for wearing under pants in the winter. They fit well, and you can't beat the price! Delivery was quick."
1,bad quality,i bought two of this one ripped right away quality are no good .i thought Hanes are good american product i was wrong i will never buy hanes again.
1,Worthless!,"I wore and washed these three or four times before they developed a rip between the crotch and thigh which I noticed the last time I took them out of the washing machine. Worst long underwear bottoms I have ever purchased, didn't even last a month. Also they can be very tight and difficult to get on, just getting my feet through was often a struggle though once on they seemed to fit alright. Last time I'll buy these."
2,thin disappointment,"i don't know about others, but when i think of thermals-i think warmth. with these-not so. after opening the package i held them up and they are so thin you can see through them. i tried them on and kept them on for the day, and don't think they did the job. some might feel satisfied because they never had lengthy material under their jeans, trouser,etc., so they might attribute that to warm thermals. i agree that one might need to order a size smaller than you normally would. i'll keep my pair in hopes that they will come in handy to wax the car this summer."
2,Material is weak and sizing off,The sizing is one size off too small. I order a S and then I had to reorder to get M. This time Hanes made their sizing wrong. In comparison to their other products this feels cheap. It also is very thin that when you wear them it will feel like it will rip.Functionality - it kept me warmDurability - questionable
2,Not very warm ...,"I still have the Indera thermal pants that I bought 3-4 years ago. After all the washes over the years, those pants are still warmer than Hanes. When I wore these inside and jeans outside, I can still feel the cold on my feet. Whereas on the Indera, I can wear those and khakis on the outside, I don't feel cold at all."
1,Poorly put together,"The seams on these are poorly constructed/sewn. They pulled apart after the second wearing, and no, I did not buy them too small. Just poor quality clothing. Can't recommend these."
1,They ripped out in the bottom area :(,"I thought that these were a great value, however, they all ripped out in the bottom area... And to think that I bought 5 pairs... what a waste of my money... not to mention that my son is still cold :("
2,very long...,"I gave these to my dad for christmas and the legs were about a foot too long. He's not a short man, so this is quite peculiar."
1,Ripped after first use,"I wore these one time around the house and noticed when I took them off that there was a large 5 inch rip in the crouch along the seam joining the leg and crouch.In addition, the material is very thin and cheap.Hanes used to be good years and years ago, but it is just junk now. I learned my lesson the hard way."
1,"Horrible quality, lasted about 6 hours of minimal activity","I bought these to wear under my duty pants while working as an EMT. Right off the bat, they grip leg hair like crazy, but I've been through that before, usually just takes a little bit to get the leg hair worn down some. I put them on and before I could even get my duty pants on, there was a small hole on the left side of the crotch area. I was disappointed but wore them anyway. When I was about halfway done with my tour, which had to that point consisted on sitting in an ambulance waiting for a call, I used the restroom and found that the hole in the crotch had grown into a massive split most of the way down my left thigh. Hanes used to be a good brand too, really kind of a shame."
2,"Saggy, ill-fitting & uncomfortable","These are cut for some oddly shapped butts. I got one, it's not flat back there, but these spend all their time going to the bottom of my jeans' crotch. The waistband stays a little higher in the front, but I can not tolerate digging around the crack of my butt to pull these up all night with nasty fishing hands. They stay up a little better without pants on...I am sorry I tried something because of price. Men, never compromise on underwear or socks. These drawers are lousy."
3,These tites are too light,"Not really heavy enough for my use, which is riding my motorcycle in the 40-50 degree range with these under my jeans.."
2,PAPER THIN!,"Thought it would be a decent set of thermal pants like the similar long johns you can get at Big 5. I was surprised at how PAPER THIN these were when I received them. Honestly, my sister has yoga pants and they are thicker than these.It gets 2 stars because they were at least comfortable - none of the chafing issues that some others can have. And I suppose if you only need a lighter pair for moderate Spring/Autumn excursions or something they're an OK compromise. But I would definitely look elsewhere if you want a nice solid pair for warmth."
3,Black,These arrived in good condition and timely manner. However the maker has changed the product. Not made in USA anymore. Quality shows it too. Will use but not reorder this brand.It is now a thin single waffle type that will be OK inside or outside in winter. Not as a really warm thermal outside protection from cold.
2,"""Gold"" is not complete...","While this may be a small quibble to some, there are several seconds missing from the intro to ""Gold."" If you cross-reference it against the version that was included in the ""Gold"" anthology, you'll see that version (and presumably the version that apppears on the original LP) clocks in at 4:24. The version of ""Gold"" that appears here is somewhat shorter, with some of those seconds taken off of the very start of the track.This may not matter to some, but to those of us who like the original versions of things (and, yes, I'm looking at you, George Lucas...), you may be disappointed with what's presented here, particularly if you're after the original version of ""Gold."""
2,CD Sound Quality is Very Bad!,"Sounds like it was recorded from an LP and all the high tones were completely filtered out. Mastering must have been done by an amateur. Try ""The Earth Rider - The Essential John Stewart"" instead."
3,classic sound,"Initially I bought the album just for Gold, but was happy with the rest of it too. Its GordonLightfoot-esque."
2,"Kept breaking, had to return it for a refund.","The halter is very nice, but the push button spring kept breaking out of the plastic housing, so it has been returned. In fact, I returned the halter three times before requesting the refund. The Sporn Company needs to do something with the plastic so it does not break so easily or quickly!"
5,Great professional sounding recorder,I have a performance group so we at times record here and there. The sound is very professional.Excellent unit.
2,not much to look at,this is not a very good show for YES fans it just a lot of mtv stuff if you really want to see a good YES dvd I would sat KEYS TO THE ASCENSION is the best to see
4,Cowsills - 'The Cowsills In Concert' (Razor&Tie),"Impressive!That's the first word that came to my mind after hearing this sixteen track live album reissue of the Cowsill's live piece of work here.I mean,after the numerous times I've heard other music fans EASILY dismiss this family band as a joke or a novelty.Uh-huh!That is NOT the case at all.This mother,five(was it?)brothers and one sister act CAN totally rock! Tracks that caught me by complete surprise was ""Hair"",their cover of the Mamas & Papa's ""Monday,Monday""(very well done,I might add),""Hello Hello"",Beach Boy's ""Good Vibration"",the Beatles cover ""Paperback Writer"",Cream's ""Sunshine Of Your Love"" and ""Nothing To Do"".Had NO idea they did so many covers.Certainly not complaining about it,though.An absolute should-have."
3,Unusual Collection of Live 60's Hits,"They were a pretty good live act, as this CD demonstrates, and their harmonies were great on stage and on record. Still, most of the songs on this CD cannot be improved upon, and thus, only Cowsills fans will get a kick out of hearing them. Note: ""Hair,"" ""Milk Song,"" ""All My Days,"" ""Nothing to Do,"" and ""Fun Song"" are studio recordings--all others are live versions. Decent liner notes, and satisfactory sound."
5,Great book,"""I wouldn't allow his bad day to spoil my good one"" This is my favorite aphorism in this book. Perfect advice!"
2,Meh,"I loved long halloween and i was very interested to pick up where the story left off, but this was pretty much a lame version of the long halloween. i definitely do not think this was worth any hype. if you enjoyed long halloween, read this, its a nice continuation, but remember where you came from."
5,FANTASTIC,"I read this in a few hours as my eyes were glued to the pages. My first impression was as a sequel it wasnt as good, it wasnt but none the less it was top class. The story fantastic and genius. Totally recommend."
5,another great addition to the Batman legend,"Dark Victory is basically Jeph Loeb's sequel to The Long Halloween. The tone and artwork are the same. THe story is close, really more of a continuation of the Harvey Dent story and Batman's early years. And, Loeb (re)introduces Robin."
5,Another Batman CLassic,"A great sequel to the Long Halloween, this book is just as intriguing as the first and is a damn fun read"
5,Loeb and Sale Do It Again!,"Another instant classic in the Long Halloween tradition, Loeb and Sale deliver on all counts. This time, adding Robin's origin story to another mobster-and-super-villain-filled romp through Gotham City. If you like Batman, and enjoy different art styles, you'll love this masterfully crafted work."
2,Not As Good As The Long Halloween,"In my opinion, this was a confusing, difficult-to-follow sequel to The Long Halloween. There seemed to be little actual connection to the previous storyline besides the obvious, and the plot seemed random and disconnected."
4,Great Robin Origin,"I enjoy this book more than The Long Halloween which where this book picks off. It is really not a continuation per-se but another murder mystery very similar to Holiday killer in The Long Halloween but just picks up the story where it left off. What made this book more interesting was the origin of Robin which is a lot more interesting than Harvey Dent's backstory and arguably more interesting than Bruce Wayne's history! In this book, Robin actually makes himself useful as he would have to in order to convince Batman to take him in as a partner. There are some new, refreshing villains in this book such as Penguin and Mr Freeze! A better read than the previous book in my opinion."
4,An Epic Batman Tale,"Jeph Loeb's twisting and turning story line is beautiful drawn in a noir style by Tim Sale in this Batman Saga featuring Batman, Robin, Two-Face, Jim Gordon & Catwoman."
4,Better than a detective novel,"Unputdownable. The story of hundreds of scientists and enthusiasts who wanted to understand matter and gradually decoded its secrets. Generally accessible to the lay-reader (I got a little lost when we reached proteins, enzymes and so forth), its full of little quirky details from the lives of the protagonists, making them human and interesting."
3,Uneven,"I got this book a few years ago and dipped into it occasionally. I wasn't too impressed. It struck me as a collection of mini-biographies of chemists rather than a history of chemistry.Then I read the entry on Priestly. I have a high regard for Priestly, as a pioneering chemist, as an intellectual, and as a human being. But the article on Priestly was short, factually incorrect, obtuse (that is, the opposite of insightful), and insulting to the man. I could not believe that a book that contained that passage could be trusted on any other subject. I got rid of it.As they say, your mileage may vary. Other folks seem to like the book. Maybe the authors were having a bad day when they wrote the section on Priestly, and other sections are better... So I'll offer these remarks simply as a report of one person's experience with the book."
3,City Life,"That mostly shows peoples' romantic (more so than money) interests waxing and waning. Some are reasonably happy and others quite sad. It creates some fringe characters who don't quite ""fit in"" without being too depressing or vulgar. There are no stand out performances but all the actors are solid. If I have any beef it's that not much ever ""happens"" to most of them."
4,pump,This worked great for pumping up our inflatables AFTER we got to the beach! No more blowing up!! Plugs into the cigarette lighter. Wish we'd had one years ago!!!
4,Make sure your car has a 15 amp power socket.,"The first time I used it it blew my car's cigarette lighter socket fuse. It turns out your car must have at least a 15 amp socket, and my Honda does not (it's only 10 amps). So I had to go to Radio Shack and buy a socket that connects directly to the car battery with alligator clips. (Amazon sells one called a ""12V Battery Clip-On and Cigarette Lighter Adapter""). When I used that it worked fine."
2,Shorted out,"The first time I hooked it up it shorted out and blew a fuse in my car. (Yes, I had the correct fuse for the voltage the pump was using)."
4,Coleman 12V QuickPump,"This is a high output pump that inflates or deflates my Coleman twin mattress in about 20 seconds. It has adapters for several type air valves that you might find on air mattresses or other inflatables. I have been able to fill over 20 twin mattresses on a single battery charge. The chargeable battery power makes this unit very versatile for indoor or outdoor uses. The only annoyance for this unit is that this pump has a high pitch sound while inflating or deflating. This is, however, bearable for the few seconds needed for its use."
3,weak presure pump,Not strong enough to pump up my two boats. I have a two men boat and a kayat. I have to use the manual pump to get to the needed presure.
1,very unhappy camper,"i purchased this item in brand new condition. after not opening item for 2 months,i opened charged & went camping. item did not even turn on much less inflate my boat or mattress. my fault for not opening item for 2 months,but expected brand new item to work at least one time!!!!!!!"
2,Not useful for inflatable boats,"I purchased this pump to use with my Sea Eagle SE 370 inflatable kayak. It's pretty lightweight and compact. However, for the purpose of inflating boats, it doesn't provide sufficient air pressure to fully inflate the boat. In the case of the Sea Eagle SE 370 it's able to inflate it most of the way, but it's clearly not fully inflated (I can push my finger down about 1""-2"" on the hull). I need to use a foot pump to inflate it to the required pressure."
5,Great little pump!,"I purchased this item for pumping up my Intex Seahawk II inflatable boat. I am very pleased with the product. It's certainly faster than using the hand pump and a whole lot easier on the back. A bonus feature is the deflation capability. While the side chambers of my boat easily deflate with the Boston valves, I always had trouble deflating the floor chamber. I would have to squeeze the valve and sit on the boat. Now I just attach the Coleman pump and in about a minute it's completely deflated. This is a great product for the price."
2,just a toy,"CHEAP. too small, too slow. connectors are too short and don't fit the valves tightly. have to hand-held all the time while inflate. why don't provide a connecting hose?"
1,Makes a nice paper weight,Did NOT work. I tried it in several different working cigarette lighters and nothing every time. Very disappointed. I gave it 1 star because the program insisted I rate the product. But really it deserves zero stars.
1,pos,works like crap. took almost an hr to fill the air mattress i ordered with it.. and the mattress is only a short full bed
5,Beats blowing it up by mouth!!,We bought this for a large raft we tow behind our boat. It quickly inflates and delates this device while on the boat. Very simple to use and convenient if you have a 12 volt supply on board. The deflate capability is quite useful as well.
3,Consider AC version for indoor/outdoor use.,"The pump works fine off my car's 12v power socket. But I should have looked at power converters before I bought. If you want to inflate a Coleman bed inside as well as camping, I realized after the fact that it's much cheaper to get a decent quality inverter that converts automotive dc power to AC than vice versa. So while the pump works fine off car power for camping, I'll have to inflate the mattress outdoors for home use. I'd recommend buying the AC-powered pump and then a 12v to ac adapter for the car. That way you could run the air pump, your cell phone charger, laptop or anything else that plugs into an AC outlet in your car too. Wish I'd thought that through before I bought."
2,Great while it worked,"This worked for basically one summer. We used it on vacation in August of 2005 to inflate a few items, then we used it again in June and July of 2006 and in mid-July it stopped working completely and we had to throw it away.It worked great when it worked."
2,Disappointed,"I thought by the description and photo, this included an AC adapter so it could be used inside as well as with the cigarette lighter in the car. Wrong! To be used only with a cigarette lighter. I hate returning items so gave it my daughter and her husband. Due to how limited it can be used, they haven't used it either."
4,"Great , economical blower","I used to inflate a 12' AVON raft , it did a god job , quickly . I had to top it off with a foot pump , but , that is to be expected with ANY pump. Great for the price !!!!"
5,Great pump. Cheap.,Great pump. Works perfectly for quickly pumping up a zodiac inflatable boat. So glad I did not buy the pumps they sell for these boats which is 100 to 200 dollars. I've used both 120 and 12 volt pumps for the same good results.
5,Air pump,Pump Works good. We got it to blow up floating things for the lake and we use it when we go to the lake.
4,Easy and affordable,"After shopping around in a few different brick-and-mortar stores and being disappointed by both the selection and pricing of the air pumps they offered, I just happened to check on Amazon and found this little guy. It's not the most powerful pump, and without any AC power adapter it's of limited use, but if you're looking for a cheap and mobile air pump for some weekend rafting, it's a great choice."
2,The Pump,I was not super impressed with the quickpump. I could have done with out it. I like the hand pump that came with the kayak much better. I seem to get more firmness with the hand pump than with the electric pump.
2,Looks like it was a flood item!!!!!,"All though the product works, it appears to be from a water damaged inventory. Manual is not usable and the box was completely ruined. No word of this in the description..."
4,"Works, but it's loud","Works pretty well - it's loud though. Best not to operate this in an enclosed space. It does a decent job inflating/deflating towables, it has a 12V plug, and it's not that big so as a boat pump it's not a bad choice. One complaint though - the adapters lock on the inflate side only. There's no locking for adapters on the deflate side which can be really annoying."
3,Coleman 12-Volt DC QuickPump,"It works great, but your order will not include the air adapters. I will contact them to send me the adapters that are shown on the picture. Will write you back to show whether they keep their promise."
1,worst movie ever!,"This is one of the worst films ever, I bought it as a gag gift for Christmas hope my sister likes it!!"
4,daniel's review on elizabeth of austria the bride queen,"i found this book very enjoyable to read. you could sense that towards the end of the diary she feels more and more nervous about leaving her home. if you read the epilogue, you can clearly see that she was not ready for marriage, at least not at such a young age. it was one of my favorite royal diaries and even though her life ended tragically she will surly be remembered as a great historical figure!!!!!!!"
1,utterly pointless,"Elisabeth ( nicknamed Sisi ) is a teenage (15 year old)princess , in the present day she would be a caricature of THE most self concious teenager,cosmetic shopkeepers would love her. if you really have time to waist(for example if you are in the dentist's office and this is the only book you have) you might want to read it, if not leave it well alone on the library shelve among all the dust bunnies I command you . IT NOT WORTH 10 DOLARS !!!! for example her marriage trousseau took almost two pages . and she was always whining or crying in a pillow . I will NEVER use Elisabeth as a role model exept in whining,crying,self conciousness and clothing"
4,"What a Beautiful Girl, er Book!","This story about Elisabeth a.k.a. Sisi, is fascinating in every way possible.It is about a girl visiting the Emperor to final marriage arrangements between the handsome Emperor and Sisi's sister, Helene. But Franz Joseph is delighted with beautiful Elisabeth, that he choses HER to be his wife, to his mother's dismay. To read more about Elisabeth's life with the Emperor(or about her long, aubourn hair) don't flip through the pages of this novel, but actually read it."
2,Dull and pointless,"Elizabeth never meant to catch the eye of Franz Joseph 1, emperor of all of Austria. He was meant as a bride for her sister, Helene, herself for his younger brother. Yet when Joseph passes over Helene and proposes to Elizabeth, she feels she has no choice to accept. This is the story of Elizabeth's life from days just before the proposal up until their wedding day, and the emotional journey of Elizabeth herself, destined to be Empress and rule beside the husband she never expected to have.Told through Elizabeth's eyes in the form of a journal, this book, in my opinion, was too short and utterly pointless. Half of the entries were Elizabeth writing that she had no time to write, and character's relations to each other were hard to work out. There wasn't enough description, and there were a lot of background references that weren't explained, leaving you in the dark to what was going on earlier in her life."
4,"good, but too short, and not enough detail","In this book we learn about Princess Elisabeth getting married to the emperor, and that's it. In the first few pages we find out that she is being forced to attend a ball in hopes that the emperor will fall in love with her sister, the plan backfires and the emperor asks her to marry him instead. The rest of the book is pretty much describing her getting prepared for her wedding.``Katrina"
2,"Not a ""royal"" story.","""Elisabeth: The Princess Bride, Austria-Hungary, 1853"" was a disappointment. Besides it lacking pages (the story reads 93 pages), I was hoping for more details of her life, besides her impending marriage and marriage day. We only learned that she had long hair, loved animals, and was an excellent horsewoman. Not at all the best edition to this series. I do not recommend."
1,You are forbiden to read this book,"Elisabeth, the Princess Bride was a huge dissapointment! It shows girls as being worth for nothing more then marriage! I learned nothing about the culture, history, or palace life from this book. All you will learn is Elisabeth is a slave to her husband who was meant for her sister. Elisabeth doesn't even feel bad for her sister, she acts as if she deserved it. She only cares about what her husband thinks. For example:""My teeth have grown a little yellow, I hope my husband approves.""""He has been gone for three days, I can't bear it anymore.""""I have grown a bit more plump since I last saw him and he seems to aprove!""I mean her life revolves around her stupid husband!If you 're looking for a strong girl to look up to don't read this book."
3,good intro,"I bought this book along with sklansky theory of poker, brunson super system and mike caro pro book of tells. This book is definately worth a read though does lean on the tight side of playing. I wouldn't recommend Sklansky because it really is too theoretical, super system is a great text book for dipping in and out of, and I wouldn't recommend Caro pro tells to anyone because it is a great book which should be kept a secret by anyone who gets to read it!!!Cloutier/Mcevoy is a good intermediate level booster. The stories at the end are worthless and a wasted chapter just to fill up space which is a let down as I was expecting some really cool poker/gambling anecdotes and stories."
2,short stories not educational - AVOID if trying to improve game,"being that tj is one of the most respected no limit players and Mcevoy is no slouch himself, i thought their championship no limit book would be a necessary tool in my continual efforts to improve my game. it is not! more of a book of short stories with limited poker reasoning, analysis, etc. it is amazing how many pages of this book you can read without gaining any information on proper play/strategy (literally, you take nothing away). if you still think this is a must have after my review, contact me, and i'll send you my copy for free, with only one cauveate(sp?), no sendbacks! you'll have to find someone else to send it too! msy"
1,"Some funny stories, but not densely packed with good advice","If you occassionally find yourself playing hands other than AA, KK, or AK, there isn't much instruction in this book that can't be summed up with the usual ""play tight, be aggressive"". Certainly mastering it will not allow you to quit your job and play poker full time.Some pretty funny stories, though."
2,Play really tight,"I think maybe I have read too many books on poker now. I didn't see anything new here. Basically, it says know your players and play really tight. They don't like suited aces, suited connectors, or overcards suited or not, I would like to watch a tournament from start to finish to see if Cloutier plays just aces."
2,I was hoping for more...,"This book contains many stories and not that much poker-tips.The tips are pretty basic and many of them are told repeatedly throughout the book. The result of that is a book with 304 pages that contains a net total of maybe 100 pages of poker-lessons. Not good. Sure, the stories are very entertaining to read and the authors both have a LOT of experience, but I got this book to get better at tournaments. Not for entertainment reading.I regret that I bought this book. Recently I threw myself into Dan Harrington's vol.1 and vol.2 and they're great. I highly recommend them. Actually I can't even think of a single bad thing to say about them.Sorry T.J.!"
4,Very confusing packaging,Product is very sturdy and easy to use. Packaging and descriptions very confusing - depending on what you read these fit anywhere from a 2x8 to a 2x12 but are really best for either the 2x8 or at most 2x10. Includes both the top and bottom but that also wasn't clear in the descriptions.
5,Ramp kit,Bought this item to use for bringing out heavy items from my storage shed. The ramps are very easy to put together and you can determine the lenght that is suitable for your needs.
5,my review,"nice set of ramps can be made with the purchase of this kit. use it for mowers, atv's, whatever you need moved for ground to your vehicle. Good price, good product"
4,Funnt,Wow that is one of the most funniest books everIf you are smart you will buy this book it is super funny
3,Far Side Gallery 2,"It was an ok purchase. I am a die hard fan of far side as it appeals to my sense of humour. However, it had about as much duration as the average archie comic and left no lasting impression. No desire to re-read. Overall a fair book."
4,Great yarn,A deceptive stroll of a story told in a laid back manner. Only later do you realise how fast-paced it really was. Characterisation is just spot-on.
5,Toy for my niece,"I brought this stuffed lion for my niece and had it delivered to Omaha. She absolutely LOVED it. In fact, half an hour later, I got an email back from my sister along with a picture. I had heard about the Melissa and Doug Plush, but had ordered for the 1st time. Thanks for the prompt delivery from Amazon and making my day in seeing the joy on my niece's face."
5,Amazing Value For A HUGE Surprise... Literally!,"I got this lion as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend, and let me tell you it was well worth every penny! There is no age limit for this gift. The quality is great, the lion is soft, and it will be a guaranteed hit for any occasion. It's also BIG! The sheer mass of the item alone makes it a steal, regardless of quality. But this lion has both value AND quality! I would recommend it to anyone who wants to steal the show at a birthday, or impress someone special. You won't be disappointed!"
5,So Large & Lovable. Great Value for the Price.,"My daughter loved this huge, lovable and like real lion. Such detailed features Great value for the price. Love it."
3,Lions Club mascot,I purchased this Lion for our town's annual 4th of July parade as our local Lion's club mascot to ride on our float. It was a hit. Now will plan to use it at all our Lion's events.
1,The Mane Keeps Shedding!,"Our daughter has the Melissa and Doug Tiger and it has been a big hit for the last several years! He is starting to look a little ""loved,"" but overall, has stood up to some serious playing.Since the Tiger was such a hit, we decided to bought this lion for our Son last October for his third birthday. The lion is cute, large and cuddly... but the mane hair keeps falling out! It's worse than having a golden retriever dog!You can tell where in the house the lion has been because of all the fur that has been left behind. In fact, this toy sheds *so* much that I do not feel comfortable having my son sleep with it.Purchase at your own risk!"
3,Lion,"This lion was purchased along with the big Melissa and Doug tiger for Christmas for my daughters. We also received an additional M&D lion from my parents for Christmas for the girls, meaning we now have 3 large cats at our house. While our 3 girls ranging in ages from 5-10 love their new animals, they are made poorly. Having them in our house for less than 24 hours, one lion was noted fresh out of the box with a hole in his head at the top of his face where his mane meets his face. The tiger has 3 different locations of holes at stitching sites. Also, true to a real cat's nature, they shed tremendous amounts of fur all over my carpets. Also, like I'm sure previous reviewers stated the one leg that is so much longer than the other front leg looks a little weird. With all this being said, my girls don't mind any of it, and love their new realistic looking big cats."
5,"""crap crap crap""? Awesome Awesome AWESOME!!!","I had to go down memory lane and lsiten to Kj's first debut album. I have some of his other albums but I've never listend to this one until now. Kj-52 sounds HOT and FRESH! I LOVE his voice, talent, and message in this debut album. Heck, if I didn't know any better, I'd say eminem took some notes from KJ! lol, jk, but KJ sounds so fresh in this its not even funny. Great job, and this deserves a dove, much more a grammy!"
4,kj52 Is Off Tha Chain!,"This group is hot, with a fresh new take on Dc talk's Hardway. This is one of the next big christian rap and free style groups!"
1,"krap krap krap, what a waste ot time and money","this cd is horrible, it's just as bad as it pronounced five two AND WHAT IS WITH HIM AND T. CLEAZY, that was john's!!!!!!!! GGGRRRR. this is not hip hop/rap it is just krap, i must give kj credit for that he has created his own style of music, KRAP! i can't stand this nerdy old geezer, he is horrible. don't buy this. i rate it .5 out of 10"
3,Avenging Angel,"I have a collection of 75 of John Wayne's movies. This DVD is a collection of 3 of John Wayne's grade B westerns from the 1930's: ""The Dawn Rider"", ""Paradise Canyon"", & ""The Trail Beyond"". The plots are somewhat ""corny"". Although some purists may be upset, the movies have been restored, colorized, & have been given new background music. I think they are an improvement over some unrestored flickery versions of these movies. For $10 you can't go wrong."
1,A Rip Off,This and other titles called The Young Duke Series are fraudulent rip offs. Each dvd takes three existing John Wayne movies and re-titles them so you don't recognize them until you open the package.
5,Nice little twist!,My child is not much of a reader but he couldn't put it down. I will look for more from this author. Thanks.
1,What the hell,where the hell is pinacoladaberg? naughty cal? pleasure island? the best songs in the movie aren't even on the soundttrack... doesn't make any sense to me
1,No coconut Pete equals a bad rating,With all due respect to the talented musicians on the soundtrack with a very low bow to bob marley. the only reason a person would actively seek out this album is to hear bill paxton singing NAUGHTY COW!!! not to mention pleasure island and pina-coladaburg (Do not confuse with margaritaville around Mr. paxton) so it gets a bad rating after recieving this big disappointment
1,"The ""Cononut Pete Songs""",This soundtrack probably sucks because the Coconut Pete songs aren't on it. I didn't buy it. If you want the Coconut Pete songs you can download them for free from Bill Paxton's web site (billpaxton-online.com)
2,No Coconut Pete !,"Yikes, if you ""get"" this comedy, most of the fun comes from the Buffett character played by Bill Paxton aka Coconut Pete. His songs are viscously insightful parody of Jimmy's work. But they arent on the CD. An incorrect Bill Paxton link is provided by another reviewer on this page. But here now, is finally the correct link where you can find Mp3 downloads. www.billpaxtonweb.com/ A German tribute site (with English mirror); go to ""media"" and you'll find all the Pete you can handle."
3,....pour another shot of tequila....,"While the soundtrack contains a very solid mix of Reggae, where the hell are all of Coconut Pete's songs? If you're looking for a fun mix of Island Jams, this is for you. For the stoned college student looking for a funny record at about 20 after four, keep looking. -AWAHBIG inc."
1,Very pity,IT is actually a problem to have Coconut Pete songs. U can not find them anywhere. They were written by Kevin Heffernan (one of the writers of the movie) and performed by Bill Paxton himself. So there is NO WAY u could find them. And they DO NOT put them on soundtrack????? I dont believe this
1,"Coconut Pete...why is ""Naughty Cal"" not on this CD?","Broken Lizard's 'Club Dread' deserves a decent soundtrack that truly accompanies the film! Unfortunately, the soundtrack release that we got was nothing more than some mumbo jumbo reggae that I can't hardly remember hearing in the film! Where are all the Coconut Pete songs like ""Naughty Cal""? This is not the soundtrack album that I had expected to hear! There should be a follow-up release featuring the complete score by Nathan Barr and all of the Coconut Pete songs that were in the film! Fans of this film should contact Record Labels like La-La-Land Records and Perseverance Records and make a suggestion! :)"
1,No Bill Paxton?,OMG Unreal.. Just seen the movie and loved it..but the whole reason for the soundtrack is to hear coconut Pete. Thank you earlier reviewers for metioning that the cool songs from the movie aren't on there. Peace
1,The End of The Affair,"What I don't understand is why this CD does not contain music from the movie soundtrack such as Jo Stafford singing ""Haunted Heart"" along with a Vera Lynn song, etc. What happened here?"
3,"Pretty, but not particularly original","Fans of Nyman that are familiar with his scores for 1990's The Hairdresser's Husband and 1997's Gattaca and liked them, will probably like this disc as it heavily relies on strings and is based on simple and emotional melodies. Hardened fans of the louder, pulsing and drivin work for Nyman's band, or more difficult concert work only, should likely stay away from this one. Generally likable with plenty of the music fueled by sensuality mixed with pain that Nyman is so good at, but not particularly ambitious or original. Fans will be glad to see him working with violinist Alexander Balanescu again though!"
4,"Not top-quality Nyman, maybe, but still a class act","This score is an example of the warmer, more extrovert style the Nyman began to adopt in the past few years, against his ""trademark"" style (chugging rythms, saturated strings etc.), now used principally in concert works. ""The end of the affair"" reminded me of the wonderful ""Gattaca"", but on a lesser level: the orchestral palette is less varied and the inspiration level is not so exceptionally high. So, while this music works wonderfully with the (very good) movie, it's lesssuccessful as a piece of music in itself. Still,it's music-making of a pretty high order, which effectively evokes the feelings of an ill-fated love story ,and Nyman fans should not hesitate. Also, given that nowadays the average level of soundtracks is usually miserable (you know, 10 min. of music and the rest is a bunch of second-hand pop-rap songs not even heard in the movie!) this is a release to enjoy for everybody."
4,"Well, I certainly loved this score..","It doesn't seem that others were as impressed as I was- but while I was watching the movie I noticed the score more than anything else, and that's the reason I bought the soundtrack, so it didn't leave me dissapointed!"
1,white screen,"NOT MUCH LUCK WITH THIS CAMERA ,WORKS GREAT FOR AWHILE THEN WHEN YOU COME BACK AFTER A FEW HOURS OF NOT USEING IT ,BRING IT UP AND IT HAS AWHITE SCREEN WHEN TALKED TO TECH. THEY SAID TO UNPLUG IT THEN PLUG IT BACK ,THAT WORKED BUT GOT TIRED OF DOING THIS..THE PRICE WAS GOOD,BUT IS IT WORTH ALL THIS?"
4,needs software,"The camara works great, but don't try to e-mail anything...it takes FOREVER! I'm in the midst of trying to locate some compression software, otherwise it's worthless for e-mail."
1,Simply Horrid,"I read this book while in Antarctica last year and had to force myself to finish it. It became a contest of wills to see if I could read the entire book. McMurdo is a weird place, no doubt about it. But somehow, while the author perhaps had the best intentions, it veered off into something that becomes rather incomprehensible. I spent over seven seasons on the ice and there are so many other stories to tell; the people, scientists, raytheon, projects, science, bureaucracy, idiocy, etc., that would make a great story. This book is unfortunately not a great story. Buy another book, any other book..."
5,A really excellent resource,"This book is a treasure trove of relevant info in an easy to use format. It is divided into regions (e.g. Ireland, Scotland...) and includes a brief history of each Celtic region and its language/naming practices. Within those sections, names are listed alphabetically. The author includes the history, meaning, gender, and the very necessary pronunciation(s) of the names, and tells readers all the various spellings and their implications (e.g. Old Irish spelling, modern Irish, or anglicized). It is definitely the best resource of Celtic names that I have yet seen, and I heartily recommend it."
4,Excellent source for Celt names,"Wonderful assortment of names (not definitive and maybe difference of opinion on some)> Not divided into male and female names, but then these days with a penchant for giving male names to females maybe I am being picky.It gives the meaning of the names,drawn from Celt Languages of Scots Gaelic, Welsh, Manx, Beton and Cornish - 1200 traditional first names from Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, Cornwall, and the Isle of Mane, with the pronunciations, and interesting tidbits about people that had the name. The only US book with names offering this wide of a selection. Since many people have trouble with pronouncing these names, the pronunciations guide is every helpful.Of special interested to writers looking for Celt derivative characters for their books."
2,Well....,"There were not all that many names for being a baby name book. A few were interesting, but most you can figure out why they aren't in common use anymore."
5,Great bang for the buck!,"I've been using this set about 2 times a day for the past 3 years and I have had no issues with it at all,they clean up nicely with baking soda and they still look new.It's worth mentioning that this cookware pulls off very low temperature cooking with great ease and I've been very happy with the results.This may seem trivial but the metal utensils that come with this set are 1st grade and are very stiff,I put a lot of pressure on the metal spoon when frying rice and it handles all my force without flexing at all and I wish that my other metal utensils were as high quality as this."
3,"Look nice, sticks kind of easily...","My husband bought me these pots for Christmas. They are very beautiful, but the food that I cook in them sticks pretty easily, sometimes even when I do use cooking spray."
3,First set of Stainless,This was the first set of stainless that I have purchased for myself I have cooked with stainless in the past just never owned any. I was expecting more from this set but for the price I guess it is ok. The spoon and spatchula are thin and bend easy the saute pans are light and just kinda feel cheap but everything I have cooked in them has turned out fine and they clean up pretty easy. I feel like if your looking for a mid quality set of stainless cookware for a reasonable price this is it.
1,Cheap and flimsy,Turn brown on first use. Handles get extremly hot and the pots and not as pictured entirely and the ones I recieved looked slightly wider. They are thin and evin at the discounted price are pricy. Somethimes you have to see in person to buy and I think cooking pots are one of those. Should have sent it back but I bought it for an occasion but will probably throw them away or give them to goodwill when done. They are embarrasing next to my heavier guage stainless steel sets.
5,YAAAAY! NO MORE TEFLON,"I decided to rid myself of teflon! No more cancer causing carcinogens for my family! Great price, fast shipping, LOVE ME SOME t-FAL!!"
1,Do not buy because it looks nice,This was one of my worse investments ever. It looks nice that why I bought it with the confidence that it is a T-fal brand and it must be good. I can't even prepare rice in it because it burns it.I don't like to write bad reviews but I don't want you to waste your money! I love T-fal but just not this one
1,Tfal Do NOT Buy,purchased this cookware set two weeks ago and I have hated that decision. This cookware is HORRIBLE. Everything and I mean everything sticks in it. I followed their recommendations about seasoning the cookware and only cooking on medium heat but nothing helped. Everything still stuck. Also if you use the included metal spatulas it scratches the cookware really bad. I contacted T-Fal about the issues I was having with this set and they informed me there was nothing they could do about it and pretty much told me my warranty does not cover any of the issues with sticking and scratching. The ten dollar set of cookware you can get from dollar store is way better than this set and does not stick half as bad. I would in no way recommend this product to anyone.... Buyers BEWARE
2,Do not break your glass lid.,"T-fal does not offer replacement lids for this cookware, which is an issue since glass lids are fairly easy to break. The pots have been fine."
3,"Eh, I've had better...","My steel bent at the top too! No rough handling, no dish washer, high heat, or anything unusual. I could bend my pot it with my fingers as well, as I attempted to straighten my pot out. It took a long time for anything to heat up when I was cooking, even with the lid on. They do clean up nicely though.I think I am going to return mine and get a better set. I feel the set is cheaply made, but at the price, I guess you get what you pay for. I really think I could find better for the price though, especially here on Amazon."
3,No Closers for the steam vents,With no closers for the steam vents you have to find something to plug them with or rice won't cook right. Other than that they work phenomenal w' my induction cooker.
4,good,Bought it for my birthday. I love karakoe and the song selection was great. Easy to use and great cont. Shipping was fast.
4,"If you like other Wes Anderson films, the this is right up your alley!","The latest from Wes Anderson, using a lot of the same troupe as usual (Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, etc.) Light but fun movie about three estranged brothers who are called together by the oldest after he has a bike accident (and the an epiphany). They set off in India on a train ride to find their inner spirits. These comedies are more chuckles than belly laughs, but they come often and are nicely quirky. If you like Wes's previous movies ('Royal Tannenbaums', 'Life Aquatic', etc.), then this is right up your alley."
4,"""I wonder if the three of us would've been friends in real life. Not as brothers, but as people. ""","Wes Anderson's The Darjeeling Limited is a sardonic, dialogue-driven film about three disjointed brothers, Francis(Owen Wilson), Peter(Adrien Brody) and Jack(Jason Schwartzman) on a train ride through scenic and beautiful India. On their 'spiritual quest' to relate to each other again as more then friends, but brothers they hit many snags along the way, and ultimately they find themselves stranded in the middle of the desert.This film is not for everyone, the pace may drag a bit slow at times and subject matter questionable, you will find yourself loving it or hating it.Myself, I thoroughly enjoyed it; the change between the brothers, finding themselves, letting go of their excess baggage and enjoying the ride."
2,Bad disc,"Condition was basically brand new, probably used once or twice, but still very good condition. It came it the mail earlier than expected! I opened it and all looked right, the disc had no signs of scratches on it at all. However, when I watched it, half way through the movie it would skip about 2-3 scenes at a time and I can't even watch the end of the movie because it the disc freezes and won't even play, every time! So now, I am probably going to just go to the store and buy it :/"
2,"Stop That Train, I Want To Get Off","I adored The Royal Tenenbaums, and usually I find Wes Anderson's films fun and inventive. But sadly, TDL seemed like a misfire to me. The spritual journal of three brothers by train is a great concept, but this film seemed to lack the emotion necessary for me to care for the brothers, or to make me feel like they cared for each other. Visually, the movie is stunning, with vivid colors, beautiful turbans, and gorgeous settings. True, clever lines are scattered here and there, but overall I found the story too scattered, possibly in need some fine tuning, to care."
2,What were they thinking,"Good quirky cast but story line, just seems to go no where. Something got lost in the editing."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I liked The Royal Tenenbaums quite a bit, but The Darjeeling Limited wasn't that good. I didn't really laugh once and I could care less about the characters. Thank goodness the movie was less than 90 minutes long!"
2,Is this supposed to be funny?,I got this thinking it was a comedy. But it's not funny at all. It's just weird. I got bored and stopped watching after about 30 minutes.
2,dull and boring,My husband and I could only deal with about 1/2 hour of this movie. I don't understand why others rated it so hight and as one of the funniest movies of the year (2007 I believe). Slow starting and never really gained any momentum when we were watching it.
2,Video,Cute movie a little slow good actingUnbelievable story line. I wouldn't watch this a second timenor would I recommend it . Quirky film
3,not bad.,"The thing I like about this movie is the fact that all these guys in certain parts of the movie, like when they were trying to meditate just look at each other like ""yea this is stupid, why are we just staring at each other?"" This movie wasn't bad though. I really did not get the scene when they went to get the deceased father's car, but other than that it was very comical and entertaining."
3,A so-so movie,I have seen Owen Wilson do better --- could not say much for the story. And Bill Murray...wow talk about a cameo role. Not sure it qualified as that even. Not worth the money
3,Darjeeling Limited HD,"My sons (one high school, the other middle school age) ordered this video and enjoyed it. I thought it was silly but had some interesting moments, so if you're in the mood for an Owen Wilson movie it's worth a shot."
3,The great Indian train journey !,"The movie has a disjointed narrative. In parts when the narrative seems continuous, the point of the story is unclear. It could have a special appeal for those who romanticize long train journeys (like The Palace on Wheels?).There is nothing in it for an Indian living in India. But, it gives good glimpses of the country to those foreigners who are visiting.Wonder why the name of the movie, when there are no scenes of Darjeeling or the journey to it? The train seems to travel through the desert of Rajasthan. At least, it is in a village there that Irfan Khan makes a brief but satisfying appearance.This is a must see for foreigners traveling to India for the first time, as it zeroes on several aspects of the daily life in its train stations, bazaars, temples, village and so on."
3,And now for something completely different...,"I've seen one too many ""let's look at India but not the REAL India"" movies lately. Fortunately, this isn't one of them. Instead, it's a movie where India is a backdrop to be ignored, aside from one totally unnecessary subplot about sex that could not happen.Rather, this is an observant and very watchable film about three brothers who set out on a ""spiritual journey"" in which they never get out of themselves long enough to notice anything else. Good chemistry, great acting, sharp writing, and a fine movie."
3,Lost your pet snake on the train?,Three brother on a vision quest to see their motherwho has become a nun in India learn something about life and death and friendship.Wisdom is probably not included in their rewards for the road trip.But becoming brothers again has a value.
4,Snake On A Train!,"My favorite scenes of the movie are with Bill Murray and the expressions on his face, it doesn't get better than that, and the beautiful wide-shot of the train when it gets lost. I like Angelica, but only tolerate Wilson and the other two actors because it's a Wes Anderson film. BTW, wtf were they planning on doing with that snake anyway?"
3,"I can see the quality, but ....","it took me three days and many pauses to get through this. That said, I think it's a high quality film and a delightful look at India. I liked the soundtrack of Indian music. Much of the humor is so subtle as to be almost missed one time around. It's precious, but you'll enjoy this, if not savor it."
1,Not one of Wes' great ones...,"I just finished watching this....unfortunately. I really like Wes Anderson and had high hopes for this movie but I was completely bored. I should also mention that I like all types of movies, meaning not just Hollywood blockbusters, but this one left much to be desired.Quirky, yes. Interesting, no. Fortunately I caught this one on cable and I would not buy it nor would I pay to rent it either. Forgive me if this review is in disagreement with the others that rave about the film, but I just did not like it."
3,Good intentions are present but nothing else happens!,"Wes Anderson constructs an existential comedy around three brothers who (like City slickers) decide to take a ride to India and make a stop to visit their mom who lives in a Himalayan Convent.The initial sparkling idea ignites before the first third part of the film and what it could be a comedy of major specific weight strands, becoming a set of isolated vignettes with some laughs here and there, but the cohesion is missing."
1,Very Limited Darjeeling!,"I hated this movie. It was 91 minutes of excruciating agony to watch three self-absorbed, small-minded jerks ride on a train. There is no message or deeper meaning to this movie, except perhaps to avoid films set on trains, films about Americans in India, and, above all, films by Wes Anderson. If you are looking for a vastly superior movie about three brothers and their bonding rituals, try any of those starring Larry, Curly, and Moe."
1,I would give this 0 stars,"This is one of the worst movies ever. I have nothing against Wes Anderson, but come on people. This is the movie equivalent to diarrhea. Aside from the beautiful landscape, this is beyond bad. Do yourself a favor and watch ANYTHING else."
1,Idiotic,"One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Self-indulgent, boring, all in all, an idiotic trifle Watch something else."
4,Not for everyone,"This is one of those movies you either love or you hate. I like it, but I am not suprised that it has drawn some very negative reviews. It's not for everyone."
2,Unlike the last few Wes Anderson Movies,"I was excited to see this movie however walked away very dissapointed. Unlike many of Wes Anderson's movies watching this one again will not make it better.As a fan of the last few Wes Anderson/Owen Wilson films, this movie had very little of the dry, witty elements of movies like ""Life Aquatic.."", ""Royal Tenenbaums"", etc.This film has a few little laughs along the way, however always veers back into drama, leaving you wanting more humor. However, the attempts at humor break up the drama, leaving you in the middle.Good performances from Owen Wilson & Adrien Brody, however Jason Schwartzman adds little. Bill Murray makes a quick cameo in the first 45 seconds and maybe he was exactly what was missing.Unfortunately, this film gets stuck between a drama and a comedy and satisfies neither. I'll look fwd to the next Wes Anderson film but I can't reccomend this one in good faith."
5,Wes Anderson continues to be a unique and wonderful voice,"While this got very mixed reviews from the critical establishment, I found I really enjoyed it. Wes Anderson's style is consistent with his earlier films; the same great use of pop music, great tracking shots, low key, oddball humor and detailed performances. But here, in the story of three brothers trying to re-connect on a trip to India, there's once again a human, emotional core under the absurdity. Not perfect, but better than 98% of what's getting made.The Criterion Blu-Ray is really gorgeous, but I gotta say the regular DVD, non-Criterion release still has quite a nice image. Go for the Criterion if you can, but if cost is a big factor better to get the plain old DVD than not get the film at all."
4,A very good film but not as good as The Royal Tenenbaums,"The Royal Tenenbaums is my favourite Wes Anderson movie, and while The Darjeeling Limited is a great movie it is not that great. Recommended."
4,Saved by Faith,"In an age when there is so much criticism of organized religion and doubts of the role of faith in the lives of individuals it is refreshing to read Dr. Sydney Duncombe's new novel, Enduring Faith. It is a moving tale of the great love of a young girl for her kid sister. The story has its exciting moments with contact with the drug world and its disastrous impact upon a bereaved widow. There is the mystery of a cold blooded murder. This is the backdrrop for the love story of two innocents, Tom and Mary. Above all it is the story of the central role of faith in their lives. Dr. Duncombe writes with conviction that has been tested in great suffering in his personal life. His faith has sustained him in trials that would overwhelm the nonbeliever. Not only is his faith enduring but to the sensitive reader his faith can be contagious."
5,Good quality,Although on the pricey side these socks are definitely made with a quality material. They control my lower leg swelling all day long and I will be buying more when needed.
4,Long-lasting stockings,I have been using two pairs of stockings for over six months and have they have stayed in pretty much the same condition since new. I ordered two more because one stocking has a small tear between the top strip that has the grip and the rest of the stocking.The stocking grip could be better because my stockings tend to slip during the day.
1,to much money and this is not good,"no buy this, i buyed this and i realy no like becouse no work, it's not comprecion, no sirve esto es tirar el dinero a la basura !"
5,Just Didn't Get to Use It...,"After we bought these to replace our present door locks, I ran into a problem, as our older mobile home didn't take this size of lock. Unfortunately we had to return them, but had we used them as pllanned, I know we'd loved them, as the brand and product are superior to what the lock smith ended up selling us."
5,The Ultimate Cordless Drill,"I've been a frugal DIYer for over 30 years but only recently tried Bosch tools (starting with their trim router). Amazing quality caused me to purchase Bosch's Litheon Hammer drill, and now I can chuck (pun intended) my well-worn 3/8 inch corded drill out the door. All the power and features you could possibly want in a cordless drill, and the price was irresistable. I find that I also enjoy having the bragging rights to a thirty-six volt (read it- 36 volt) power tool. That's more power than a wimpy 24-volt airplane or long-haul tractor trailer. 36 VOLTS RULE - ARGHH! ARGHH! ARGHH!"
2,Good drill before the motor burned out,I'm a casual do-it-yourselfer/home owner who bought this drill about a year ago. It was nice for drilling holes in concrete and boring holes in wood until the motor burned out. I'll have to see how the replacement motor does. Maybe it was just a one-off bad performer. I expect a drill like this to not have motor problems. I have a seven year old Ryobi that's still working well with a lot more hours of use on it than the Bosch.
1,The bigger they are....,"Got this thing in a 4 tool kit (if you can call the flashlight that flashes on for 1 second a tool). It powers through wood with ferocity. Drilling in concrete with 5/32 bit is slow and tends to burn up the bit. I like the feel of the handle and the balance of the unit. After 6 months of jobsite use, whilst drilling in porcelain tile with a 5/32"" bit the motor shot out bits of its fan blades and other metal pieces. To its credit I unjammed it with a sharp blow and I was able to finish the job, but I think I am paying to be a test dummy for expensive equipment. Bosch sent me a new one in 3 days."
3,Shafted,The drill performed well the first 3-4 times I used it but the drive shaft broke the last time. We'll see how the service system works. I loved the added power compared to 19 volt drills.
2,It is the heaviest I have seen,"The same performance an be obtained from some other lighter drills. Too bad that I did not have a chance to try it at a local store (as they do not carry this beast), and would not have purchased it. The chuck looks cheap (B&D;).November 15, 2009Used it to drill into concrete wall, was slow and I then switched it with my corded drill, much faster. The tags, two of them on the unit began coming off within days after I received the unit. They are put on the unit by the cheapest and non working glue. It should be embarrassing for Bosch to put out a cheap looking product like this. I have several other Bosch products that I could not like more (the hand grinder, drywall screw driver, flush cut saw, and planer).December 8, 2009My son used it for his science project, yes it was overkill, but every time he put it down, it fell to the ground because of the round corners on the battery. He commented that Bosch cannot design a stable battery."
2,Burnt Motor,"I am rough and rude to tools. For the money, I expect a motor which will NOT burn. Motor is under engineered compared to the battery and there is no safety to protect the motor. When drill gets stuck, handle bends and trigger becomes locked into on position. Expect the motor to burn two seconds later. In short, you have one second to get the trigger unstuck.The battery and the drill were designed together. The drill cannot handle the battery. I had two Porter Cables 19.2V previously and the handle and the same flaw which caused the trigger to get stuck on and the motor never burned. I should have bought another one, but I wanted Lithium Ion. The Bosh is either designed wrong or the motor was defective.Now I get to see if Bosh will uphold their warranty."
5,Torque Monster,"This drill is everything I could ask for. The batteries last for days between charges and it's got enough power for just about any task. I generally use a plug in hammer drill but this has come in handy on several occasions. When I used the hammer drill function it zipped through the concrete without flinching. I've used a ton of cordless drills and this one is by far the most impressive. It is heavy by today's standards but it probably weighs the same as an old 18V NiMH drill. It's also probably excessive for homeowners. But if you need a professional drill with fearsome power, this is it."
5,The best drill on the market,"Great drill. Super engineering. i got the one with the larger capacity batteries and they have a really long run time. ANd the drill is designed so that the weight is not a problem. Very well designed and engineered. Pwerful and the easy to use chuck is absolutely super. I like the way you can check on the battery capacity by pushing a button on the battery. THe charger is nice, has a built in handle and it charges really fast. This is a powerful tool, and better than the others I have used in the past."
5,"Excellant, heavy duty and very good service from Bosch","I am impressed at the quality and incredible well built Bosch drill. From the first experience of drilling hard wood, you quickly understand the difference of this heavy duty drill vs. the cheaper built drills out there. The bit will not slow down and will remain at the same constant speed! The battery packs are devices within themselves. Button to check the battery level, temperature working light. They are heavy and the drill is overall heavy with the battery, but its not your average drill.Finally, the service Bosch provides is non-negotiably superior, I have tried them in past and all I can wish for is that they continue the A+ service.I would recommend it!"
1,Good drill - bad electrical components inside,"The drill worked fine for about 5-6 times I used it for light work (maybe a total of 10 minutes run time?) around the house and then it gave up just when warranty expired.Upon disassembling the drill I discovered that the trigger assembly failed. Frayed wires on that little ribbon cable going back to module above battery pack and consequently melted plug with lots of green corrosion around the pins. Looks to me like something oozed out of that module and caused the mayhem. I would bet on cheap capacitors inside that spilled the electrolyte.Replacement part is $120+ for the whole ""trigger assembly"" and no sub-components available for replacement. Seriously?Whole new drill can be had for $140 but why invest in such poorly designed tool? To have it fail again in a year?There is no excuse for such part to fail on such expensive tool, I would give it 0 stars if I could but here goes 1."
4,Whirling wrenches,"Great glitch-tronica debut from the (late) Louisiana duo is a bit short of a masterpiece, but is still a very classy affair of layered, buzzing beats, underlying memorable melodics, and impeccable production reminiscent of an M83 by way of Squarepusher."
5,I love Telefon Tel Aviv and Auditory Underground.,"Telefon Tel Aviv is an incredible group with an extremely unique personality which is hardly found in the US. Their intricate music constructions are like ear candy. IMHO Fahrenheit Far Enough is a necessity in any intelligent music lover's collection.ALSO, If you like them, you'll like Auditory Underground (www.Auditory Underground.com), they even have a review from Joshua Eustis from Telefon Tel Aviv on their website. They're definately worth checking out. I'm not sure if Amazon lets you post a link but ill try:<a href=""http://www.auditoryunderground.com"">http://www.auditoryunderground.com</a>.Hope you enjoy both of these groups!"
5,Past memories,Owned this album when it first was released. Over the years it was lost.Great memories returned when we were able to listen to this album again
4,Must have for IT Tech,"This adapter works with most hard drives allowing the tech to inspect, move or erase files etc. Also helps determine if the drive is DOA, quickly and efficiently."
5,Worked perfectly.,This worked perfectly on the first try. Wanted to erase my hard drive before sending my computer off for repairs. I am a Mac user.
5,Finally a reliable IDE/SATA USB Combo!,"I work for a small IT company in Los Angeles. The ability to connect to a hard drive over USB is very valuable to many of our tasks.Of 3 or 4 different USB IDE/SATA HDD kits, this has been the only one to stand the test of time. It has been extremely reliable and very functional. Every cable you could need for it comes with the kit.Definitely recommend this kit if you're looking for a product like this!"
1,Almost fried my hard drive,"I bought this to access an old hard drive that had important documents. The minute I turned the power on from the switch in the power cord, smoke started rising from the circuitry at the bottom of the hard drive. Luckily, I quickly unplugged. I ended purchasing a USB 2 hard disk enclosure from a local store at about $21 (after taxes). I was able to access the data and copy it to other drives."
4,This does a great job,"I recently had a hard drive go bad in my laptop. What was I to do? Luckily, the laptop was still under warranty, so the manufacturer sent me a replacement drive and software restore disks. However I still had to recover a lot of data from the dead drive. This cable was super easy to use and the instructions were clear. I was a little wary of the USB connection (rather than SATA or IDE) but the cable worked like a charm. Setup was easy, my computer recognized the old drive right away, and I was off to the races pulling my old data off. The transfer rates were great. I probably recovered 15-20 GB of data in maybe 10-15 minutes. The time flew by. I am very pleased to have been able to recover data from a dead drive with a cable as simple and as cheap as this one."
1,junk,"Ordered mid-April, here it is not even July and it is completely dead. I also suspect it of frying out front usb ports on a tower I was using again. Return window is closed, now I'm left holding Junk. Thank you China."
4,Not as geeky as I thought need more electronic knowledge,worked just as they said it would once I removed the adapter from the drive. Would have been nice to know that
1,Not so good,"I picked this up to have a covenant way to back up data from drives that need to be re-imaged. I have tried this device on my 2 home computers (1 laptop running Win7 and a desktop running XP) and my work computer (win xp) with IDE and SATA drive, one being brand new. Every time it made the computer unstable; extremely slow, freezing, etc.I tried to format an 80GB SATA drive plugged into it and 4 hours later it was only at 43%! I then plugged the same drive right into the PC and it formatted normally. Trying to copy data was painfully slow and several times I would get a message that the destination was no longer available.Maybe this just happens to be a defective one, but I think I will just go to another brand."
4,Convert External Hard drive to USB drive,"The product arrived quickly after ordering, and worked just great. Easy and fast to use, helped me dump a ton of old files off of old hard drives."
5,Tech Tools,Great value all techs need this in their tool kit AAA+. Compact good quality all you need to test run and get files off a non working desktop or laptop..
5,I recommend it,I've just opened yesterday and used it to connect an old desktop pc hard disk to my laptop. This adapter works excellent so far so good. I'll post if I find any imperfection...
4,Does the job,Bought this product to use with my old HDD when the external case failed. This product does the job -- allows me to read/write from the HDD. Minus one star as it is slow for my computer to detect and load the drivers. Also had issues with getting it to work with the Mac.
2,"Gets the job done, just don't breathe on it","This adapter got data off my hard drive and back on to a new drive, but just barely. If I breathed in the direction of the adapter, it stopped working. I'm not impressed. I was hoping to be able to use it as a permanent adapter between my old laptop hard drive and my NAS device, but it is not nearly stable enough for such a situation. It works in a pinch, but is hardly nothing for more permanent uses."
5,ide and sata adapter for ssd install,this adapter was used to allow me to copy the old ide drive in an old compaq r3000 portable so that i can install an ssd in the computer...this adapter allows both ide and sata to be copied.
1,Not working as expected,"Too slow and hard to access files with adapter. I gave up using it because it was ""killing"" my system."
5,"Works, that is what I wanted.","Gave this 5 stars because it is a product that either works or doesn't (1 star). A SATA/IDE to USB is a must have for all computer technicians and I have used this 4 times in the last 2 weeks. You simply plug it into a wall jack, and then plug it into the hard drive you removed, and then plug into USB. Any Windows systems after XP will auto recognize it as a USB storage device and allow you to transfer files. You could use it to add extra hard drives to your system, but even at USB 2.0 speeds that would be a waste. Great for technician work, could even be used to clone your hard drive so that you can store it off site or in a fireproof safe. In the 2 weeks, I have had no issues, works as advertised, 5 stars."
1,garbage,Absolutely worthless. This is so poorly made there is no way to get it to work. badly put together and uselessly poor fitting. The Chinese have ZERO quality control a a complete disregard for the customer. A total waste of my money. It deserves zero stars.
1,It made a rubber burning smoke,"I don't know if it was my luck or something, but when I used it for the 2nd time it made a nasty smell and smoke of a rubber burning, but it didn't fry my HDD."
4,Just what I needed for the job,I had an older IDE only version of one of these dongles and finally had to upgrade. Works like a charm! Used it twice so far to transfer files from old HDDs to new systems. Have used both the IDE and SATA ports and had no issues whatsoever.
2,ide to sata power adapter,The ide to sata power adapter went bad after about 2months! SIGH! A friend of mine bought the same item and had the same problem.
1,Product very hard to connect and install,"I found this product very hard to connect all together and install properly on my desktop . The seller needs to provide improved , detailed and clear instructions !!! The users manual is very useless ! I would not recommend to any friends or relatives ! And if I were to try connecting between my pcs , I would fear if connections were correct or if I would electrify my hard drives ! I found windows easy transfer very easy to use and bought the windows easy transfer cable and used it .I also bought an external cd drive for my laptop at Best Buy which works very well . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !! IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY !!"
1,"Nice idea.... Poor quality, unstable, and can be said to be useless","This product stopped working in the first week after purchase. After trying everything to get it to show on my computer,.... I decided that the device was trash and began checking into similar devices that look better and perform better!The device is ugly and awkward. The advertisement was rather misleading. If they showed how the item truely looks when you have to set it up,... I would not have purchased it and I believe many others would have passed on it too!Ugly, unreliable, dangly wires, very short lifespan = a waste of money and should be discontinued as a choice on amazon."
4,Worked as advertised,the usb connection was occasionally lost but this could have been the system or the device.for the price it is unbeatable
4,Does it's job,I am a newly A+ certified tech and find this is a very good at doing the testing of hard drives and the ability to transfer files to all the hard drives that I have. Highly recommend this product for daily use.
3,50 / 50 Chance it will work,"I bought 2 of these, one of them works perfect and the other was DOA. The one that didn't work wouldn't power up any of the 5 drives I tried even though the light was green.I can understand that broken items get sent out. But what really gets me is that I had to pay almost as much as the device cost me to ship it back to exchange it!!!Seller should AT LEAST pay the return shipping on a DOA product...So you have a 50 / 50 chance yours will work, in my experience."
5,Vantec usb adapter,"This Vantec usb adapter is great. Last year my computer dies and I needed this to get all my pictures and music off the hard drive before formating it, and losing everything. Amazon has one of the best shipping I have ever seen."
2,Bad Power Supply,The power supply on this item had a green light but woudl only actually power items intermittently. I almost threw 2 drives away because I thought they were dead. If you wiggle the on/off switch you can get the power working. Had the power supply worked consistently this would have received a 5-star review.
5,this is cool,i have to say i didnt really know what i was buying just trying to find something to help me take my files and such out from an old computer's hard drive without going crazy and came across this item that has made it 100% easy to swap out files from a hard drive and now i have an empty hard drive with lots of memory for storage.. and its just wires so u can take them everywhere... this is a great product and recommend it to anyone -- seriously my 5 year old could put it together lol no offense if u had problems with this item i love it...
4,works,used on 5 different IDE hard drives of various brands and ages that I had sitting around the house. worked every time without problems.
4,SATA/ IDE to USB Adapter,Worked perfectly first time for me. I had an old Dell Desktop and removed the hard drive - which I am now using for back-up.
1,Not as described - doesn't work for small old drives with data already on,"This was a good idea, but it wasn't described properly. It didn't work with old notebook drives, it didn't match the pins on two 2.5"" I had (IDE). It did match the pins on a bigger one, but it wouldn't work with it because it was already formatted and had data on it. Apparently you need to use this with bare new hard drives.None of this was mentioned in the listing or on the product box. And the documentation seems to have been written a decade ago, oops, stops with WinNT and XP, no Vista or 7. Nothing in there about what to do with a disk with stuff on it, which was why I got this product in the first place, so I could both salvage old photo files and also reuse as external drives with Vista and Win7 computers. It's going back ASAP!"
1,Stone age technology will not return.,Old IDE drives do not play well with Windows 7 even if you just try to suck data out of them.G
1,Junk,"I bought this device in an attempt to get files off of an IDE drive from a computer with a dead motherboard and transfer them to a new computer. Plugging the drive into the IDE adapter, attaching the external power supply, and plugging the USB into the ""diagnostic"" computer (my laptop) has the following results.The computer (running Windows XP) ""sees"" the USB device, and recognizes that there is some kind of disk storage device at the other end, but the drive is not recognized in ""My Computer"" (nor anywhere else that I could find). Instructions in the CD manual are useless, as is the Vantec website and their email ""technical support""."
1,Missin,I received the box and once I open it up the main part was missing. All the cables where there except the adapter. The box and the packages in side didn;t show that it look like it was open.The next day I just reuturn it back with a RMA # with no problems from Amazon and decided not to order another one.
1,Don't buy this one! You may lose data!!!,"I bought this one a few days ago from Amazon because it's cheaper. But my hard disk (from my old computer) was not recognized. I went to VantecUSA webpage and followed the instruction for troubleshooting. It suggeted me to "" initialize or format the disk"". Please checkout the webpage yourself. [...]I almost did it after so many ""do this"", ""try that"", ""restart"" etc. When you are frustrated, you would like to just format your disk.But my friend has one adaptor made of by another company. I borrowed it and my old harddisk was recognized by my new computer (Windows 7) right after the power was tuned on.I am going to return this device. Don't buy it. You may get so frustrated and want to format your disk and lose your data."
5,Just Works!,Used it to move files from old HD to new. It quickly recognized the drive and I easily copied the files over. A great piece of hardware to add to your collection.
4,It works...,"This device is relatively easy to use. It does look somewhat easy to break since it seems to be made from plastic, but unless you are handling it roughly or too often, it should be durable enough. I have only used it to connect to a hard drive so far, so I can't really comment on how it works with CD/DVD drives. It serves its purpose. My biggest complaint is that the device does not always seem to be detected when it is initially hooked up to the computer. Restarting the computer or unplugging and replugging in the device typically does the trick. Thankfully, this product is relatively less expensive compared to others. Therefore, 4 out of 5 stars."
4,USB Hard Drive Adapter,"Does what it is supposed to do. I had no problem using it to recover the data from my laptop hard drive. I am no 'IT' guy, but I am at least semi-technically savvy."
2,Good when it worked - Failed after couple of uses,"I bought this a couple of years ago and used it the day it arrived to test a drive that was in an external USB/Firewire enclosure that was giving me problems. I put everything back in the box until I used it a week later once replacement parts for arrived for my external enclosure. Everything worked fine and I put everything back in the box again and put it on the shelf. Recently, I had need to use it again and grabbed it off the shelf. Dead! Power LED does not come on. At this price there is no fixing it and there is no warranty at this point. Pretty pathetic that it didn't work on the 3rd use after sitting in the original packaging on a shelf. Was great when it worked but pretty sure the power supply is the issue at this point and probably as a result of being cheaply made. Wouldn't buy Vantec again as a result. My original plan was to buy theNewerTech USB 3.0 Universal Drive Adapterbut I ended up compromising for price. I won't do that again."
2,no good,Had a few hard drives. Wanted to find out which were good and one has data I wanted to transfer. First drive went fine. Second drive didn't spin up. Noticed the light was blinking on the power supply. I powered it off threw the drive out an started on the next on. Power supply has died. So 20 minutes of work with 3 drives and it's a brick now.
2,broke down too soon,"The power adapter broke down after couple of uses. It won't power on any HDD. The warranty accepted for replacement, but I had to pay more than half the price of the product, to get it shipped to them. I might as well buy another one.The product itself is a good idea, and very handy for quick access to HDD. But not satisfied with quality and the fact that I had to pay to ship it back for warranty replacement. I don't think if I will buy or recommend another Vantec product."
2,Cheap Product Quality,"I bought two of these and both failed after several months, even a couple of years' use on one. The plastic case on one fell apart, and the electronics in both simply quit. I'm now searching for a quality replacement.They were easy to use."
4,Easy hard drive access,"This is a very useful device for anyone with a bit of experience tinkering under the hood of a computer. The package includes:- the actual adapter itself, which provides an USB connection to 3 different types of hard drive connectors -- 5.25"" / 3.5"" IDE, 2.5"" IDE, and SATA.- an IDE (4-pin MOLEX) power adapter.- one SATA-to-SATA data cable.- one IDE (4-pin MOLEX) power to SATA power adapter.- a mini-CD containing a manual and drivers. It is not necessary to install drivers in Windows ME / 2000/ XP and above systems.Both the SATA/IDE-to-USB and power adapter cables are reasonably lengthy; 3' for the former, maybe 5.5' for the latter.Vantec's SATA/IDE to USB 2.0 Adapter provides an easy way to access a hard drive without needing to install it into a computer. It also works great for extracting data from old computers without having to figure out how to turn them on -- all you have to do is take out the hard drive."
1,fire,"i pluged up my hdd to retreive the information off of it and the connecting cable cought on fire, i do not recomend this product, it was not the sellers fault,obvouslty a product issue"
1,Bad power supply,"The power supply was bad. I tried the unit with two drives thinking I might be doing something wrong. Then, out of desperation I pulled out my digital multi-meter and tested the power supply. The voltages were all over the place. Bad quality control."
1,Thankfully bought from Amazon,I had a NAS HD die on me and I wanted to retrieve the data myself so I ordered this item to help with that process. Not only did it fail to recognize the drive at all it (SATA) it also didnt recognize an old IDE drive I had laying around therefore I returned the item which couldnt have been easier.
4,A life saver,"This little gadget is a life saver. After trying a variety of different solutions to get family pictures off a Windows XP hard drive that would not boot, I was able to pull the drive out of the PC, hook it up to this cable, and copy the files right out onto a new Macintosh. The catch is that you have to be at least moderately technical to get the hard drive out of the PC and hook this gadget up. The instructions aren't provided unless you go to the manufacturer's web site and even those are pretty cryptic. Works perfectly though and seems pretty well made. Best twenty bucks I have spent in a long while."
5,Hard Drive Addapter,Turn any hard drive into an external drive. Great for backing up data or taking home data on a desktop to work with at night or over the weekend.
5,Totally Mac Compatible,"For anyone wondering about Mac compatibility, but I was able to successfully retrieve data off two hard-drives, one Mac and one PC, using a computer running Mac OS X. These little cables were a total lifesaver and simple to use."
1,Multiple shipments of non working parts,"This product arrived non-functional. Got a replacement transformer, still didn't work. Went with another product. Never again using Vantec products."
4,Did just what I needed,"This product did exactly what I needed. I had an old IDE 3.5 HDD that I needed to get the data off of. My windows 7 64 bit system the computer told me the drive needed to be formatted, but when I plugged it in to a WinXP system it worked great and I was able to pull all the data i needed off of it. This will come in handy in the future!"
5,Very Happy,"This thing worked just as advertised for me. I had a desktop with two hard drives, which died. I bought this device to see if I could pull any data off the drives to my laptop. The one drive was just completely dead, could not be recognized at all by the laptop -- but the other drive was recognized very quickly and I was able to easily and quickly recover the data on there. It would have been a much bigger problem without this, I would have needed to find some other desktop to use, etc.... but this was a snap.As others have mentioned, this thing comes with about every adapter imaginable to enable plugging into every kind of drive out there. It also comes with a power supply for drives that need external power. Cords are short-ish, but really not too bad.No complaints from me on this one :)"
4,Better than others,"I've bought little kits like this before, and I like this one a lot more. The inline power on/off switch is nice, as is the lighted LED on the usb adapter. One thing though - the IDE to SATA power adapter is still garbage, just like every other kit I've had. The pins are weak and you have to be really careful you don't push them out or bend sideways when plugging the adapter in."
5,"Does exactly what is needed, more reliably than OEM","This set is as straightforward as it comes. A power supply and plug, and a 3-sided USB adapter for SATA, IDE 2.5"", IDE 3.5-5.25"". It beats a USB-cable-only adapter as you don't have to worry about routing power from the computer, this comes with its own supply. You plug it all together and it works. And the cables and plugs are nice enough quality, not junk.After my enclosed backup drive died, I thought it was the disk drive itself, but took a chance and tried this set. The drive turned out to work fine; it was the OEM (major manufacturer) enclosure USB interface/controller that failed. This setup replaced it and it may not as pretty as the OEM enclosure, but it works, which beats pretty in my book."
5,A good solution,I do a lot of PC repair for friends and family and this adapters is invaluable. It's worked on every drive I've used it on and comes with every kind of plug you'd need right in the box. Highly recommend this if you have to back up data from dead laptops.
4,O.K.,"Received product on time and in perfect condition. I have many uses for this set of connection equipment, I've only had it a few days and already I have used it on 3 different hard drives. So far, I am A very happy customer. Thank you very much..."
4,Awesome!,Although I was afraid at first from reading other reviews about the cable heating up. I rolled the dice and I'm glad I did. The instructions are a little hard to follow and I had to reread parts of the manual but it worked great and I have used it to pull files from two old hard drives I had sitting in the attic.
1,Never could get this to work...at all,"This is a real learning experience for me: ALWAYS check an item for functionality as soon as you get it. I've never been able to get this thing to work for me. I didn't try it until after the return window had closed. From what I've read from other reviewers, I'm not the first to have issues. All this does is cycle the drive (SATA) on and off...My windows 7 machine never even realizes there's a USB item attached. I can hear a whine fade in and out, but it never powered one of my working drives. Bottom line: Check everything you buy within the return period. Luckily it was only a $15 lesson!"
4,Good Device,I bought this device to capture data that was on an IDE drive from a system that I upgraded to a new Win 7 notebook. I liked that the device could handle IDE and SATA drives. Also it came with its own power supply. I only tested an IDE drive and that worked well. Good purchase.
4,Works Well,"The Vantec USB to SATA/IDE Adapter worked like I expected. This model is smaller than other models and has just a SATA data connection on the actual unit. The power adapter must be plugged into the SATA hard drive when using a SATA drive. The same goes for IDE drives. I used to have a different brand and model adapter that the entire SATA drive would attach (power and data connections), and you would hook up the power to the adapter itself. I do not see a disadvantage to this method. The SATA drive connects to the adapter via a SATA cable (included). I needed this to hook up an internal drive externally to clone and restore an image. Keep in mind USB transfer is always much slower than SATA to SATA.No Cons as of now"
4,It works!,"Techy stuff is usually not for me, but it worked and had a good price. I did need to go online for instructions."
5,Just WORX!,I got this as a last hope to save some old data from 1994. It works out of the box on both my LINUX and those old windoze boxes. Well worth the price and it works better than expected! Very happy!
1,Doesn't Work,After trying for week I am still unable to get this to work. The drives power up but the O/S cannot find them. I am at a loss of where to go from here...
2,Product worked as it should but did not read the HD.,"This adapter worked okay and was easy to set up but did not read a HD from an old laptop with windows 8. The adapter said I needed to reformat the HD when there is over 350gb of data on it and it is not corrupted. I read the FAQs and saw the support info on the site and got nowhere with this. I will call the company and see if there is another answer and if not, I'll try to return this to amazon and take the HD to a computer place."
1,Doesn't work,"I've been building computers since I was 13, so I figured using these cables would be easy. Unfortunately, they didn't work at all. Lights flashed, drives spun, but the computers never recognized the devices. I tried this with a combination of two hard drives (2.5 SATA and 3.5 IDE) and three computers (Win 7, Win XP, and MacOS X). Still no luck.Returned it and boughtCables To Go 30504 USB 2.0 to IDE or Serial ATA Drive Adapter (Black)which immediately worked with no problems at all. Do yourself a favor and do the same."
4,Convenient and useful device.,"I pulled and saved 4 old hard drives from a couple of non-functional laptops and a desktop and needed a way to access the data on them. After doing a little research online (YouTube how to videos) I came upon this device and others like it. I decided to try this one in particular because the price seemed fair and the reviews were mostly favorable. It came with easy to follow instructions and it did exactly what it was supposed to do. It successfully brought up each hard drive I had except for on which I believe is defective. All in all, this is a handy gadget to have in your data storage arsenal. The only complaint I have is the red LED light on one of the components apparently burned out fairly quickly so it is not as easy to known when it has connected the drive to the computer. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars instead of only 4."
4,Nothing short of amazing...,"This is a great product. It literally brought my 3.5"" SATA drive to life. My HDD was having some trouble with Win 7 and I would have to format it to use it. I used this adapter change a hex value and bam, it was back up with all my data intact.Four starts because of all the messy wiring that I will have to manage. I am planning to cut a hole in the shipping box and hide everything in there."
2,Would probably be cool.. if it worked.,"As far as I can tell, this product doesn't work at all witn Windows Vista, Windows 7, or XP 64 bit."
4,Worked Great but its fragile!,"This product worked as advertised. Never had a problem with functionality, as it worked immediately upon plugin. Just be careful with this item! The slightest wrong pull of the power cable that connect to the HD will disconnect one of the four power cables and pull it out. There's no way to be it to stay back in either. It still works but you have you get it to hold and stay in otherwise you get no power. Just be careful with this item and it works great"
4,worked for what I needed it for,"The processor went out on my old hp desktop, and I found this. I took the IDE drives out and hooked them up to this, and transferred everything onto my laptop. I also had an old small external that the connector board was fried in, it was SATA. I got a new external, and put all my stuff on it. Also, my laptop is an Acer Aspire 1 and it doesn't have a CD drive. I took the old DVD burner out of the desktop, and hooked it up to my laptop with this. It is kinda annoying though, because of the way it hooks up, but I work around it."
2,Burned,"This product worked perfectly for about three days, then one day when I plugged it in and turned my computer on it got so hot that it started melting the wires on the power converter cable. I wouldn't have noticed except it smelled really bad. When I tried to unplug it, it burnt my hand."
3,Good when working.,I bought this once to find that the power switch kept getting stuck. Returned and replaced it and got a set with a bad MOLEX to SATA adapter. Bought one of those separate and everything works well now.The actual device is such a time saver.
4,Saved my data,"I bought this when my laptop had a motherboard crash and needed to save the hard drive. I was able to use the SATA/USB adapter to transfer the data to an external hard drive through an older spare laptop, recovering the many pictures and videos I created since my last backup.Easy to use and with enough adapter options to operate with multiple formats. This saved my hundreds of dollars where stores like Best Buy would have charges to analyze and recover the data onto CD's. If you can remove a hard drive you can use this adapter. This one use paid for itself in cost and heartache of losing weeks of work.The only things I could dock it for is the use of USB 2.0 and the packaging and presentation. Using USB 3.0 would have allowed for MUCH faster transfers, useful when moving 500GB of data. Some other adapter packages come with a case and wire management that the Vantec CB-ISATAU2 lacks. But these minor issues are reflected in the pricing."
4,good buy,"I must say Amazon Prime provides the best shipping . The product works well. im an IT guy and i have quite a bit of HDD lying around the house that i ddint n=know whether they were working or not , this allows me to connect the drives without having to open the case to pop them in. And the price is definitely worth it."
3,Does the job but with flaws,"The adapter connects the drive to the laptop, but somehow kept disconnecting from the laptop whenever large amount of data like pictures and videos were transferred. This means that instead of transferring a large folder at once, due to the disconnecting issue, I had to transfer only small chunks of the folder at a time. Definitely more time consuming, but still glad that at least data can be recovered."
1,Extremely misleading,"Bought it to extract files from an old dead laptop. It wasn't compatible. But to make matters worse, it gives absolutely no mention that it's not compatible with certain hard drives (Usually older, smaller drives) - the description says nothing about it, and neither does the manual. Not only did I buy a product I have no use for, but I wasted 20 minutes wondering why it wouldn't fit in my drive and I had to google search it to find the problem.Who knows how well it actually works, but the fact that people would buy this product only to find out it doesn't work as advertised on everything is just horrible from a PR perspective."
1,It's Dead,It worked once then it just stopped working. I assume it was the power supply that was dead because the light wouldn't even turn on for the on/off switch.
2,If only it worked,"I couldn't get the product to work. It is not a complicated product but I'm not the only one that had problems with this product. It was tried on 6 drives on 3 different computers. Two of the drives were known working drives one IDE and one SATA. I didn't spend a great deal of time trouble shooting what was causing the problem (it may be voltage). The manual is not well written. I did talk to tech support and received email support. They provided suggestions, but to no avail. If it works for you it is an inexpensive solution to recovering files from old drives, but I don't want to have something that works part time.p.s. Amazon was great! Quick credit back to my account."
3,operation,The device has some problems reading some drives. Some Maxtor and Western Digital drives were not seen by the device.
1,Did not work on my WD SATA drive,"Did not work on my WD SATA drive. Don't know why, returned it. Went with the C2G version which worked."
4,Works as expected,Has all of the attachments that I was expecting and works fine. I do wish that it had a longer power cord but that's a minor issue.
5,Hard Drive Support Made Easy!,"The perfect tool for any hard drive (IDE, E-iDE, SATA, 3.5"", 2.5"")I've connected all of them and copying files was never easier. Price was great, too. Makes hard drive/file support a piece of cake."
2,"Maybe OK for casual use, not for large files","I bought this product to copy drive images from older systems to some new 500GB internal drives that I purchased for this purpose. I had some serious problems with copying the images to the drives (through the dongle), with it typically bombing out around 40MB on USB 1.1 systems and around 500MB on USB 2.0 systems. After messing around with it for a few hours (and discovering that smaller files worked just fine), I began to get the feeling that it was a faulty product. After trying another Vantec with the same results, I returned it and bought the very similar product from Bytecc. While I agree with another reviewer that the connectors are better on the Vantec, the Bytecc product actually worked with my multi-GB files, which is kinda the point. Score: Bytecc - 1; Vantec - 0..."
1,Do not use for Windows 7,"It's a great iodea but there are no drivers for Windows 7 and, as a result, doesn't work under W7. The manufacturer website offers drivers for Windows 97 and that's it. Amazon should stop selling this."
1,I will have TOLD you so...,"Had one of these that actually WORKED. Got another for working on friend's PCs. It checked out OK initially. When I actually began to use it, it had problems even recognizing drives. When it would, there were write failures. Returned it to Vantec and got a replacement. It is as bad or worse that the one it replaced. The original one I got is now acting up. I'm tired of messing with these people and their products and wasting my time, efforts and money. As far as I am concerned, as they CONSISTENTLY put out a bad product, they are feeding, housing and clothing themselves and their families with STOLEN money."
1,does not work at all.,"I tried to read an EIDE drive no luck. Would not power up the drive. The lite came on the adapter but thats all. I returned this to Amazon, no problem.I ordered a StarTech PCI express card, we'll see if this will do the trick.Edit: I just installed the StarTech.com 1 Port PCI Express IDE Controller Adapter Card PEX2IDE and it works like a charm on my new Intel i5 motherboard."
5,USB hard disk adapter,"I bought a new ACER laptop at $329 (I'm cheap). Then I bought this adapter to read a 350 GB disk from my old desktop Dell computer. The adapter worked out of the box as soon as I learned to turn it on BEFORE I hook the USB onto the laptop (a 5 sec procedure). That was not clear from the instructions, and I had to call the factory for explanation. Their customer support (with a strong asiatic accent) was excellent. Then the adapter worked perfectly. There is not much to explain here. Either it works or it doesn't. Well, it works just fine.My only problem is not with the adapter but with Win7 not allowing me ""rights"" to read this 'old' hard disk written in WinXP. This issue has nothing to do with the adapter, but with Win7 itself. The adapter works perfectly every time (after the call to the customer support). A good price, a good deal. Buy it. I would buy it again in a jiffy.Jaime RuizMiami, FL"
5,Vantec SATA/IDE to USB Adapter - Excellent,"The product should be in everyones ""computer kit"" that helps friends, neighbors, ect..., with computer problems. Using it, has saved a couple of my friends, and the Food Bank I volunteer with, several hundred dollars they don't have to pay to get their data off old ""hard drives"" when ""mother"" boards have failed. Wonderful product and very easy to use."
5,Works Perfectly for my IDE CD/DVD Burner,"I Brought a IDE 5.25 inches CD/DVD Burner for my Desktop as i did not have a DVD writer in-built. After i received the DVD burner i realized that it won't fit in my computer (The slot given was too small for this DVD Drive. I had no chice but to buy this SATA/IDE to USB converter and use the burner externally. It arrived in time, Was easy to install. And works well. No noise, No issues so far. The given DVD is only for Windown 95, It is not required for any Windows OS more latest.I like this product and would recommend to anyone looking for a converter and to be able to an internal DVD Burner or Hard Disk externally."
5,An excellent product,I use this product to retrieve data from a laptop or PC that is pretty much dead. A friend of mine had one (a different brand) that I borrowed. It works really well.
5,Nice lil Tool,Awesome!!....Really helped me transfer my files from my old laptop to my new lappy :) very satisfied with the ease of use that this adapter provides.
1,Broken power brick.,"The power brick didn't work right on day one, and required some jiggling to get power to the drive. Didn't seem like too big of a deal, since once the power was active I could just set it aside and everything would be fine. Any movement of the power brick would cause the connection to drop, however.After a couple more uses, the power stopped working altogether, and the brick's light doesn't even come on. Occasionally it will come on briefly, but no fiddling of this thing will keep power on enough to do anything."
4,Invaluable for IT and Home,"If you've ever had a machine failure where you weren't quite sure if the drive to your PC was salvageable, this device can save you a ton of time and hassle. It's a tremendous aid when it comes to data recovery and couldn't be more simple to use."
5,Great product & easy to use,I am very pleased with this product. I recommend this to anyone that wants to transfer data from their old broken computers to their new ones.
3,worked great for a while,"My unit worked great for a while and I am going to buy another one. It kinda sux in that to send my defective unit back would be a big hassle, so it looks like mine will cost me $40 instead of $20. Three stars because of cost :-(I ordered one for a friend after He saw mine, He loves his. Oh WellBTW, I am the DH, not Kathleen"
5,perfect,"old computers. needed a way to read the hard drives and grab the old data off of it.this worked great!!love it.you have to set the jumpers on the old hard drives, but its not that hard.otherwise very easy"
2,"Good Idea, Impossible Execution","Plain and simple, I couldn't get this to work with my hard drive. I am not an IT gearhead, but I'm pretty good with making things work. I couldn't figure out how to connect this gadget to my hard drive and to the wall outlet and to the external computer. The directions were useless. The item seems to be pretty well constructed, but it turned out to be of less than no help. I don't know whether I just got a bad unit or there was some secret handshake I didn't know but I wound up sending this back for a refund."
3,Could be better.,"First of all I found out that this is not compatible with Vista. Plugging it into my Vista PC, which was what I intended to transfer data from old HD to, would not recognize it. However, the product does state on the outside of the box that it is compatible with Win98, 2000, and XP. The disc provided has drivers for Win98 and their website has no other drivers other than the Win98 available.Needless to say I had to hook this up to another machine that ran on XP and then transfer files from that machine to the Vista machine. No real software to make things any easier or to tell you that it is working or not. I had difficulty when the first 2 drives I hooked up weren't recognized, it wasn't until later I found out they were bad drives. I would think there would be something a little more user friendly for those who don't spend their lives working on PCs all day."
2,Didn't do the job,"The package arrived as promised, and I was very happy- then I plugged it in. I'm 1 for 7 with it recognizing my HD's. 2 - Western Digital 120GB, 2 - Western Digital 80GB, 1- Hitachi 6.45GB laptop HD, and 1- Toshiba 60GB laptop HD, not of them were recognized. The only HD that was recognized was a Maxtor 40GB HD. All are IDE drives.If all you have is Maxtor, I guess you're ok. But if you have any WD, Toshiba, or Hitachi, you're SOL. Bottom line, it didn't do what is was supposed to do."
4,it works!,"be persistent.- my old computer crashed and all my files were backed but not my daughter pics and videos. I was about to send the drive to a recovery company but the price was to high. I did some research and order the adapter that compared to the recovery service price, it was almost free.my system didn't accept or recognize the adapter at the beginning till the third time. I have all the pics and videos back!"
5,Product worth using,"After purchasing this product and using it, I was glad that I ordered it. The product arrived in a newly packaged box with all instructions. It also arrived quickly after placing the order. I would order from Amazon again."
4,Recent Win32 VB Convert,I recently decided not to upgrade my Microsoft VB6 development toolset to the latest .NET product. Basically driven by cost. I then decided to look for an IDE that could deliver similar functionality and decided upon Nusphere PHPed. This is fine product although I do not give 5 stars as I have found the debugger a little temperamental at times. In time I know this product will mature and become a valuable asset.
4,Unique,"If you can take a topic like curling and make a fairly entertaining movie, I don't know why Hollywood acts as if they are out of ideas. This comedy was refreshing from the usual stuff that is churned out of the studios. It's about a Canadian curling team getting together after ten years. It's what their coach had in his will that he wanted who recently passed away. Leslie Nielsen becomes their coach. He toned his comic shtick down but he was still quite funny. I'm not familiar with the others but they played their roles well enough."
2,"Watch the Movie, Instead","Like most novelizations, this book falls far short of the movie it recounts. While the movie is quirky and breezy, the book plods along. Much of the humor in the movie comes from quick, physical comedy or the actions and reactions of the excellent cast, and that translates badly to the page -- by the time the author reaches the punchline, the reader has lost interest in the joke. While the book fleshes out the roles of some of the characters, in many cases, much of the story works better with more left to the imagination of the viewer. It is clear why much of the additional information was left out, it does little to advance the story, and slows the telling.Watching Men With Brooms is highly recommended, but don't waste your time (or money) on the book."
3,Good but not the best,"This a moving account of a family's struggle to deal with a grown son's head injury, but it suffers from a lack of judicious editing. There is a bit too much repetition and inclusion of unimportant details that detract from the central, compelling story of their son's recovery. I found myself frustrated by descriptions of homes and meals that had little or no bearing on this central story and its powerful message. I think people read these books to learn more about brain injury or to be inspired by the courage and perseverance of the brain injured person. This book accomplishes those goals, but I have read other memoirs that do a better job and make for more focused accounts of the pitfalls and triumphs of the brain injured and their loved ones."
3,Not bad....WHERE'S THE CD_ROM,Interesting book but constant references to a non-existent CDROM are annoying
4,"Finally, a comprehensive introduction to Linux programming","Those familiar with Linux know how obtuse its documentation can be. Anyone who has tried to compile Linux software will appreciate the additional information about what is going that is provided in this excellent text. You are bound to be inspired to try some highly educational examples. For those who want to try programming, this is an indespensible aide.Unfortunately, I found some errors that are hard to spot. You may be luckier."
2,good coverage sloppy editing & depends on nonexistent cdrom,"Nicely fills some holes left by Wrox's Beginning Linux Programming. Pretty broad coverage if necessarily shallow. Not just a compilation of howtos and faqs, but decent writing. BUT! Constant references to a CDROM that doesnt exist, and generally these are where a fragment of a sample program is being discussed and you want the whole listing, and there isnt one. There are 3 authors. One, Mark Whitis, maintains a site with the code for *his* chapters only. He says to see the sites of the other authors for the code to their chapters, but doesnt provide a link to their sites. His comments on publisher SAMS are so damning, you wonder why he published with them. This is an expensive book (arent all these halfwitted computer books?) for someone to buy only to face these omissions. Too bad too, because its coverage is otherwise what I wanted. BEWARE!"
3,Agree with AK from Moscow,"I completely agree with AK from Moscow regarding this book. Now I have only the 1st edition, but unless *major* changes were made, I would expect similar results.If you are completely new to programming or completely new to programming in GNU/Linux, or if you are interested in writing somewhat trivial programs for only yourself, then this book may be of help. I would not recommend it for experienced programmers. As AK said, Linux Application Development by Johnson and Troan is significantly better. The WROX book is also better. Both of these books are much more well written than Linux Unleashed, by which I mean independent of the material. Stronger editing should have been applied here. It does cover a lot of topics, but so does my dictionary."
2,One shot wonder,"Other than ""Black Betty"", just some mediocre southern rock. But worth it just for that."
2,Who Knew?,"Did anyone have any idea there was a Ram Jam song that wasn't called Black Betty? The likliness of you knowing it was about the same as hitting a traffic jam on I-355 circa the 2PM hour. Ram Jam sucks. Black Betty however is amazing but one song does not make a band. This album should be Black Betty, 20 times."
3,"Ram Jam's Black Betty fizzles, get Spiderbait's version","Like all of you I ony bought this CD for Black Betty, however their is a vastly supierior version of the Black Betty by Spiderbait, Thats the version that plays in the film The Condemned. It's about 50,000 times better than Ram Jam's version.The problem with Ram Jam's version is that at 1 minute and 48 seconds you have to skip or start the song over since it becomes nothing more than inane rifts that are horrible no lyrics and nothing simialr to the song you love. The rest of their getest hits is nothing more than filler music, that you will never care to hear more than once if even that."
4,king of the hill complete third season,"It was pretty funny and ""emmy award winning"". Anyway I think that they should have commentary for more than the first and second season, the commentaries done by the characters were hilarious. But, all in all it is a funny animated show.Also when are the other seasons supposed to come out? I have been waiting forever and a day!"
5,happy fiance,My fiance was thrilled to receive this for his birthday! It came VERY quickly and was in brand new condition. Will totally continue to purchase more in the set.
1,Easily the worst Fox DVD release ever....,What was FOX thinking when they produced this DVD set. Cheap...thats what they were thinking. Take a great long running show and put out a cheap 3 double sided disc set that doesn't match with the first two seasons which were given great DVD sets. I personally want them to re-release Season 3 with the same treatment the first two seasons were given. The packaging is part of the reason I buy the DVDs. If I wanted plain discs I would download the episodes on the internet illegally and burn them on a disc. FOX has done so well up until this point and I hope that they are not leaning towards double sided discs for future seasons of the Simpsons and other shows. Go back to the one sided discs FOX. Give the fans what they are paying for.
3,"No EXTRAS? Dang ol'...ROBBED, man!","I have read a few other reviews and I agree that it is lacking. The whole point of putting TV on DVD is for at least a few extras. What I miss the most is the character's commentaries... I have watched them from seasons 1 and 2 and laugh harder each time I watch them. I think the show really grew into its skin during season 3, but not putting any goodies on the DVDs isn't fair to the loyal fans. I could have taped episodes off the TV and gotten the same set!"
4,Enjoyable,"Enjoyable carton to watch, not too filthy unlike such cartoons on tv nowadays. Its a good family cartoon to watch!"
3,Uba gran temporada en 3 disocos,"Una de mis series favoritas, que finalmente tengo el placer de tener en DVD gracias a amazon, para los que se pregunten, ¿como viene? bueno, vienen los 3 discos en una sola caja, así que no se preocupen ya que no ocupan espacio y hay gran calidad y entretenimiento en esos discos."
2,"Great Show, TERRIBLE and CHEAP DVD's","I love King of the Hill, it's one of the smartest and funniest adult cartoons out there. But FOX does it NO service with this crappy DVD set. NO EXTRAS, NO NOTHING, just double sided DVD's, FOX has obviously taken the CHEAP way out.Once again FOX treats King of the Hill with absolultey NO RESPECT OR CLASS. Too bad the show wasn't on another network.Also another reason why FOX has not released any other seasons after season 6 on DVD. CHEAP SOB'S!!FOX SUCKS, King of the Hill deserves much better and we the consumers deserve a lot better than these cheap, bargin basement quality (but NOT bargin basement priced!!!!!!) dvd sets."
5,Best series ever!,"The first and second seasons of kind of the hill are great on DVD. I'm sure the third season will be no exception. When previewing the episodes on this DVD, it's obvious that many of the funniest shows are in the third season."
2,No Extras??? WHAT?!?!?!?,"FOX really pulled one over on everyone this time. Not a single solitary extra in this boxset. None. Not one. They really cheaped out on this one. 3 double-sided DVDs. Thats it. As a collector, this one really dissapointed me. Why FOX continues to treat KOTH like an ugly stepchild is really a mystery to me. You dont see them skimping on the ""Simpsons"" box sets (Season 5 is brimming with bonus material.The episodes are still great, but with reruns being played to death on FX, plus the show's time slot being victim to Fox's NFL schedule, this set offers fans nothing except owning the episodes themselves on DVD.Buyer beware!"
3,No extras? That's just asinine,"I just got my collection in the mail. Any day with KOTH is a good one, of course, but where are the extras? Come on, Fox, I want my character commentary, my deleted scenes, my reasons I buy DVDs in the first place. I now have all three sets, but if Fox can't see fit to include some extras in the next set, my collection will be capped at three."
3,Really disappointed by lack of extras.,"I have yet to buy this set but after hearing about the complete lack of extras, I don't know whether or not I'm going to. One thing I absolutely loved about the first two box sets was audio commentary done by the King of the Hill characters themselves. This set was advertised a long time ago so you would assume that they would have been taking a long time putting together commentary tracks and other extras. Seeing as how I have seen most of these episodes in syndicated reruns ad naseum, I was really really expecting new, great, character commentaries."
4,Homosexuality in a Japanese context,"An interesting look at the gay lifestyle in Japan. Satoko is a young woman who befriends a gay couple, Goh and Tochi. She allows them to use her apartment for their trysts so that they will not be discovered by Goh's mother or Tochi's wife. This idyllic arrangement cannot last forever. All three characters go through trying times until the sweet resolution in which Satoko and Goh set up their own little family. Gays face enormous pressure from society in all cultures, but it is particularly interesting to see how this plays out in Japan, a culture which exerts enormous pressure on all of its people to conform."
3,Different,"The first half of the film is sheer perfection, but when the couple break up mid-way through the film breaks up with them. The ending is disappointing, but the romance between the two leads for the first half of the film is well worth the purchase price. The erotic scenes are tastefully and artistically presented."
4,An infectiously attractive film,"Great music, good cinematic carriage, nice romance, average plot. There's something about this film that I enjoyed, even though several times through it I was wondering why my friend recommended it! I welcome your comments."
4,chunky funky spanky ranky,"It is true, this is a dark album. It's dark like when the lights are out and car headlights flood your room for a second and then vanish. This is a special album because it has such a beautiful cover that glimmers like fish scales. I don't think this is as good as his first album under the Disjecta name (probably taken from a book by Beckett), but it is a moving and powerful album.Where did Clifford go? No one knows. Maybe he works in real estate now. It's hard to know. It's hard to care. Nevertheless, buy this rather than the new Aphex Twin, because it's better, and not as long."
3,Fascinating look at food history,"Blot provides a fascinating and entertaining look at our foods and eating habits in the late 1800s and shows us how our world has changed. Habits normal in his time -- using rainwater or lake water for cooking -- are unthinkable today. The items in his chart for cooking meat were particularly interesting, including wild boar, buffalo, Robin, Meadow Lark, and Blackbird. Anyone interested in food, cuisine, and history should enjoy this work from a true gastronome!"
5,Completely underrated,"This is a fantastic album that I missed when I first got introduced to Pulp. Most of the album is very ""up"" and it finds its way into my music rotation on a very regular basis. My favourite tracks are probably ""Love is Blind"" and ""Separations,"" although the whole album is fantastic. The track ""Separations,"" in particular is really interesting - the first two minutes of the song are completely different in tone from the rest of the song. (This seems to be the case with many Pulp songs, but especially in this case.)Anyway, I rarely see this album mentioned, and it really deserves a listen."
2,Finding the right Church by Shelly Steig,"The book itself is very well put together and would be very easy to use by anyone. I like the fact that the information in the book comes directly from the denomination listed, thus, preventing the possibility of bias on the part of the author. However, I believe the book should be retitled to include the word ""protestant."" As a believer of the catholic faith, I was eager to find listings for catholic denominations and dissapointed to find none."
1,"If USA Today wrote a religion book, this would be it!","Absolutely useless for anyone seeking to find out what the basic beliefs are of the various religious denominations. Literally provides one sentence responses to major theological questions. In addition, major denominations are missing (eg. Unitarian/Universalist). If you are looking for a useful guide to finding a new religion, this is not it!!"
1,Contradictory and he said she said,"Extremely frustrating to read, drones on and on and on.x,y,and z are greater than a.y,z, and a are less than b but so and so says that's not so.every page.Not recommended"
5,a staple reference,one of the many books adopted for study during anesthesia training programs. very useful for newbies and existing practitioners.
4,Good alternative to fried donuts,"I got this pan because my 3 year old loves donuts and askes for them all the time. The recipe that came with the pan was just okay, with a good frosting they were good. I found a recipe on [...] for a fluffy baked donut and with a little cin&sugar they were great. Light and fluffy. My dd at the whole donut instead of just the frosting. Good change of pace for breakfast. Will use when company comes over to."
5,Yummm,"Not quite as good as a ""fried"" doughnut - but pretty darn close. The family loved it - I need to get another one."
5,SuPeR!,I purchased two of these pans & tried them as soon as they arrived. The donuts came out wonderful and without the oil of fried donuts!
4,marlboro native,I ordered these for my daughters to give as Christmas gifts. I have made home made fried donuts for years and everyone loves them. I thought this seemed like a fund idea and an alternative to fried. They all love to bake for their families. It will be fun to see the reactions when they open them on Christmas. I am sure they will be a hit.
2,don't waste your money,"Mine came dented and I found that I could put more dents in the pan simply by pressing firmly; couldn't tell from the picture that the pan is really quite flimsy in craftsmanship if it can dent that easily. Donuts cook fine in the pan. They stuck despite cooking spray, although they didn't burn, but they weren't easy to get out because of this. I ended up having to use a fork to get the donuts out, and then most of them split in half from having to be manhandled just to get them out of the pan. Not worth the frustration."
4,good quality pan...but...,"These are good quality pans but whoever came up with the concept of a ""baked"" donut?? A donut isn't a donut unless it's fried. When it's baked, they are like eating a piece of sticky cake in ring form...not my idea of a donut. My daughter thinks it's a great concept because you're saving calories or it's good for people that need to cut fats, in that respect it is a good concept... but for a real donut.. not!As far as the pan, it's a great pan. It's a well-made non-stick pan. It's easy to clean and bakes well. Now if we can improve the overall concept of the baked donut, we'd be doing something....So 4 stars for the pan but only 1 star for the baked donut!"
3,Description wrong.,Description says comes with recipes. Pan only comes with one recipe printed on the back of the label.
2,Light weight pan,"I received this a few days ago and was disappointed in the quality. Today I saw a donut kit for 5.99 at AJ Wright. It had this same pan of equal quality, a filled donut pan, a mini donut pan and a filling injector. Yep, I bought it too. I'll keep this pan only because of shipping and restocking fees."
4,Good Little Donut Pan,"I love choclate covered cake donuts but find them too sweet in the stores so I bought this pan so that I could control the amount of suagr for taste and dietary reasons. I just tried the pan(and four chocolate covered donuts!) and was happy with it. I used the recipe that came with the pan and 2/3 the amount of sugar. They had a nice flavor but the donuts come out very light in color...not brown at all so they don't look great. Also, they do take much longer than 8-10 mins at 325 in an electric oven. If anyone finds a great recipe and a way to brown the donuts, please let me know."
5,Great Donut Pan!!,"I just love this donut pan! Such a great product to use----heavy duty and definitely non-stick. I did spray a little bit of Baker's Joy to be on the safe side, but there was really no need. I intend to buy another one, so that I can bake more at a time. You will not be disappointed in this product."
3,Works well for baked donuts,We like this pan but if you buy it MAKE SURE you season it before making your first batch. We didn't with ours and the we had to throw out the first batch of donuts because they tasted like metal. Just put it in a 400 degree oven for about 10 min. b4 making your first batch.This is really great for making cake donuts.
5,Well Engineered Pan,"Use one side of pan to bake doughnuts, the other side to bake doughnut holes. Comes with 2 recipes, one for each type. I tried the recipe for chocolate doughnuts and it turned out ok. The mixture is very much like cake batter, so I suspect any cake, muffin or brownie mix should work fine. The enclosed recipes recommend a baking time of 8 minutes, but using an electric oven cooking at 325 degrees on the middle rack, mine took 11 minutes baking time for an inserted toothpick to draw out clean."
2,"Changed design, has ridge around edge of donuts.",The design has changed and the pan is no longer as pictured. I ordered it specifically because it supposedly has no ridges around the edges.. but this pan does. I would not purchase again.
3,Tena Pullups,"My husband is using these ""pull ups"" at night. They are of good quality---however he does have some leakage, even though we also use the ""night time"" inserts by Tena also. I use a protection pad, plus a thick towel, which catches the excess. I will continue to order these, however. Maybe there will be a perfect solution someday!!1---P.McD.This review is titled, ""Tena Pullups"""
4,Best available,"I've tried alot of brands, but this is the best I've bought so far. I would recommend to a friend."
4,When you need it...,"I had a very lousy flu, and it came with lots of unpleasant side effects, one of which these ""addressed"" rather well. They do work, and although I hope they now stay on the shelf, they'll be there. They could be more secure around the waist."
2,Not the Noir I know,"I love PHC and Guy Noir. Does anyone remember (or know where I can get) the St. Patrick's Day show he recorded in Dublin, Ireland? The Guy Noir skit on that broadcast was high-larious.This particular collection is a 9-track running joke. It has its standout moments with fantastic feats of alliteration in a couple tracks and the old fashioned sound effects are fun . . . but, as another post here says, it gets less funny as it goes along.The essence of comedy is brevity and most of these skits take too long. I recall the Guy Noir skits I heard on the radio being shorter, much more varied and having a bigger cast with more fantastic stories. Most of these tracks just drag on as if by taking longer to get to the punchline the same old shtick will become funnier; mostly, it doesn't work. Unless you're a real die-hard fan completing your PHC collection, this CD is a monotonous disappointment."
2,Cookie Cutter Level 1 Flow Class with Misleading Title,"This DVD is 30 minute live vinaysa flow class taught by this guy. That's it. Nothing more - no extras. Nothing.For me, someone who has practiced yoga for two years I learned absolutely nothing from this DVD.I have no problem with someone who wants to spend $100 on producing a DVD then sell them for $15 each. My issue is with the title ""Athletic Power."" The only relation to ""Athletic Power"" is that he calls yogi's athletes in his 30 minute level 1 vinaysa class.For someone who wants to follow a standard (but short) flow class this DVD is ok (there is nothing challenging but nothing dangerous on this DVD). Except could have easily fit four 30 minute classes on one DVD ...my guess is that he chooses to put four 30 minute classes on 4 DVDs and give each one of them different misleading titles.He also does no yoga himself on this DVD so one can't get a sense of the teachers level."
5,As Advertised PLUS!,"Leviton e-mailed me the procedure for connecting this in the manner which I wanted to use it, as I was not using it in the normal configuration mode. Good job Leviton. It was kind of pricey though."
3,You really should have a professional install this tricky little device...,"I'm sure I'll like this better after it's properly installed.I just don't like having to spend $30 to have a licensed electrician do it for me.As is typical of imported goods these days, the instructions leave a lot to be desired."
5,Easy read- worthwhile message,I will say that this book was a breath of fresh air. For anyone who wonders how to make God's idea of romance work in a broken world- I would suggest a new perspective: namely Ravi's. The book read quickly but there are many jewels along the way that I would try not to rush past.
4,Short introduction for professionals,"I've read several books on the SWT. This is the shortest and most succinct of them all. The book is organized into chapters around the different types of SWT controls and containers. Then within each chapter the author presents a basic function (e.g. creating a toolbar), then covers how it's done using a combination of explanatory text and a small code fragment.I'm appreciative of the brevity of the book. It doesn't pander to the reader by going into great detail. It acknowledges what most of us already know which is that a book like this is a starting point to get you working with the basics of SWT, and after that you will use the JavaDoc when you are working on it.If you are looking for a 'getting started' work on SWT and you are already a competent Java programmer who is familiar with client side development, this is probably the SWT book you are looking for."
2,Examples do not work,"The examples do not work. They are part of the learning. It is irresponsible to not QA them. Perhaps the title says it all - it is a developer's notebook; of cause there will be bugs, etc.If you download the codes, it will take you hours to debug them.Yes the icon files are missing as well."
1,Not fully compatible,"I purchased this unit to facilitate the exchange of jpeg's between my Sony Digital Camara and my desktop PC. While you can read and write data to the Memory Stick Reader with the PC, when you attempt to download files created on a Sony camara it will give an error of ""The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable."" The same files are accessible in my camara or Sony Notebook: they cannot be accessed with the SmartDisk Reader. My attempts with SmartDisk Technical Support were unsuccessful.Don't purchase this unit if you plan to use it with genuine Sony hardware."

4,A great CD for any FNL fan,"The Friday Night Lights soundtrack is perfect for anyone who loves the show, and is definitely enjoyable to a stranger of the series. Some standout songs on the album are The Killers' ""Read My Mind"" and ""So Divided"" by And You Will Know Us By the Trail of the Dead. But no doubt the best song is Tony Lucca's ""Devil Town"", an amazing, hard to find song that defines the show perfectly. The only problem with the CD is its lack of great instrumental songs played throughout the show. It doesn't have the show's opening theme or Explosions in the Sky's ""Remember Me as a Time of Day."" The CD does have Explosions in the Sky's instrumental ""First Breath After Coma"", but it's not the best song they could've gone with.This is a must-buy for any Friday Night Lights fan, or even for anyone wanting to listen to great songs by mostly unknown artists."
1,No Title Song?,Why would they publish an FNL soundtrack WITHOUT the title or closing theme songs? Too bad. That's the only reason I would have bought it.
1,what?,"As a whole, Friday Night Lights has been more successful than most prime time dramas at using music to shape the mood of a scene, so it puzzles me for that for the official soundtrack they would go with this collection of middling indie-rock offerings. There are a few decent songs on here, but for the most part it's television-by-numbers schlock, a thing I've held this show as being above."
5,The incredible Angelique Kidjo!,"Angelique! Congratulations on what is, in my opinion, your best album ever (and I've been a fan for a long time). Your CD photos couldn't be more beautiful and the music is magnificent; the decision to collaborate with such a diverse cast was genius! You are accomplishing your mission of teaching the world to appreciate, and sing, African music. You're one of the best singers and performers of our time and your body of work is astounding; I can't wait to see you live this summer. (And congratulations on your partnership with Starbucks!)"
5,Djin Djin,"Djin DjinEnjoyed this CD, Angelique Kidjo has a wonderful voice and the subject matters of her songs are powerful. Look forward to listening to more of her music."
2,Lillian's Review,I purchased 3 CD's by this artist after seeing her on the Monique show. She sounded interesting and had great energy during her performance. I found her 3 CD's okay. I would not order anymore of this artist work.
2,Anjelique Crashes Badly,Compared to all her previous releases this is sad. Presumably by duetting with 'name' stars she's trying to break into the American market. All of her native Benin funk and energy has been diluted. Angelique Kidjoe and Josh Groban? No No No. I listened to it three times in case certain tracks improved with repeated listening. Not. I'll give her another chance with her next release but hope that if she decides to hook up with others they are a bit more adventurous. Natacha Atlas if you're listening this is not the way to go.
3,Not as good as Black Ivory Soul - but still enhoyable,"This is a good release, with many guests on it, but not quite as accessable as the Black Ivory Soul CD. However, it will get you up and moving."
3,Great if You're on a Remote Island Sipping Daquiris,"This CD made me a little sad. Ms. Kidjo is, hands-down, my favorite artist to see live, and I first discovered her when Oremi was released. In my opinion, she had a sound in that album that was all her own (one I fell head over heels in love with), but everything since has sounded more predictable, more like a Putumayo Island mix than anything notable. I love that she collaborates with Peter Gabriel, Carlos Santana and others on this disc, but the results are a bit ho-hum. I'll keep buying her music in hopes that she produces another gem, but I'm sorry to say this cd isn't among them."
4,A Wonderful Talent,"Angelique is an amazing, energetic, talented performer. This is the first album of hers that I've bought. I was introduced to her through Josh Groban's concert and fell in love with her energy and spirit. While I enjoyed the album as a whole, my favorite songs were Pearls with Carlos and Josh, Mama Golo Papa and her duet with Peter Gabriel. The blending of her and Josh's voices with Carlos accompanying was beautiful, and I felt the same way about her and Peter Gabriel. Actually any song she sang by herself was superb, but Mama Golo Papa was the one for me. Sadly I'm not a fan at all of Joss Stone or Alicia Keys so, no offense, but two more songs with just Angelique would have been fine with me. This album is definitely one that's worth buying - like me, you may not love them all, but you'll find your favorites - and you WILL love Angelique."
4,a delight,"A delightful addition to our collection of CDs by African musicians in general and Angelique Kidjo in particular. It may not overtake our all time favorite album of hers ""Keep on Moving""), but her rendition of ""Summer"" from Porgy & Bess is a wonderful offering."
3,Over the top,"I find it a bit ridiculous (though of course happy for her) that Angelique Kidjo got a Grammy for this album. She should have got it long ago, for OREMI, which to me remains her most authentic and compelling album to date. I am a huge fan not only of her as a musician, but also of her as an activist who uses music. I have tried very hard to like this album and now finally yes, I DO like it, but it is still not anywhere near her best work. It is needlessly complicated and commercial and at times even melodramatic, with rousing crowd-pleasing anthemic tunes juxtaposed with over-the-top self-righteous political messages. The collaborations work ok, but only just (they are a bit of a mishmash). Some of it is clearly contrived.. the bantering between musicians, the laughter.. come on, producers, there's no need for that. Angelique is Angelique, and Amadou is Amadou, you don't need to be so out there, we get the point!"
4,Diverse International Album,There's a song on this CD for every mood. This CD has a range from mellow island to upbeat tropical. I really enjoy it and the collaborations are great!
5,Addicting,"I originally bought one regular cornuts pack and one Chili Picante to try. That did it. I no longer like the regular cornuts because the Chile Picante is excellent. So now I only by the Chile Picante flavor. I know that Amazon sells a bigger pack, but this stuff is so addicting that I'm going to eat a whole bag regardless of the size of the bag. For that reason, I'll stick to the small bags so my family doesn't have an intervention for me and send me to cornuts rehab."
4,Joint relief,I used this for its universal joint - cutting off both the socket and the T handle. Works great for my use.
5,Breath-taking,"Just watched it... Let me tell you, it was awesome. A perfect mix of Big Mountain skiing, cliff jumping, MAJOR powder, awesome rails, and some HUGE new-school air. It is well worth the 30 bucks you pay for this DVD. It is a good hour (seems like only a few minutes) and also includes over an hour of extras(Making of Mind the Addiction). These guys really love what they do and are incredible at it.. I recommend it, and anything from TGR"
5,You'll never force a square peg into a round hole again!,This is the kind of book you have to keep replacing because when you loan it out it won't come back!
2,What a rip,"I don't understand all the hype for a book that is merely an embellishment on the authors short story ""Death in the Promissed Land"" published in 1995. Are sci-fi readers supposed to be endowed with short memories."
2,Konstantin,"2 stars for using 'Konstantin' as a name for the female protagonist. The story just kind of disappears at the end, maybe a little to 'spiritual' for me. I really enjoyed ""Synners"" and was quite disappointed with this effort."
4,"Like AR itself -- entertaining, if insubstantial","I read this book in one sitting -- yes, it's short, but it also had enough narrative drive to compel me to finish it right away. A good story, but I had the feeling the author was capable of more, and the customer comments seem to confirm that impression. (I'm pretty tired of the trend in ""literary"" science fiction where AR has to be married exclusively with things Japanese as well. What's the point of being in the future if we can't have a little innovation?) Still, it reads well, and isn't nearly as confusing as the plot summaries seem to indicate. Unfortunately, Cadigan's other novels appear to be out of print."
3,"Cool, but far from a masterpiece","This book is cool. It is one of the most cool books I've ever read. But it isn't anything else. Cadigan is unable to completely craft a world where her cyber-prophetic story can fully develop: the book is way too short to allow both a storyline and a world picture with as large a scope as attempted.Now, this is not a bad book. Not by any standards. But it doesn't have the edge of believability that Neuromancer had, nor does it have the kind of ultra-quick completely compelling, innovative style of Snow Crash. It lacks a distinct quality to make up for its shortness."
2,waste of time,"This book seemed too disjointed and meandering in plot. This is the first book in a long, long time that I put down to finish the next day, with only five pages left to read. I cared that little about how the thing was going to end. Some neat ideas crop up throughout the book, but with very little character development and plot development, at the end I was sorry I wasted my time reading it."
2,Please do not waste your time....,"I know what you're looking for... the atmosphere of a Gibson, the satire of a Stephenson, the dense prose of a Sterling.Well, you won't find it here.""Tea from an Empty Cup"" by Pat Cadigan - boring, rambling, and, when any detail rises above the morass, derivative. Plot? The only way I could tell when it ended was that the throbbing in my temples stopped.I really regretted spending the time and money - rarely happens to me."
2,No ending.,"This book starts out well, and there's some resolution to the main premise of the novel (how and why the deaths happen). But the ending left me literally saying ""That's it?!"" There's really no resolution to what happens to one of the major characters. I have not read the sequel to this novel so I don't know if the second book provides that conclusion, but I am not impressed by books that do not end. I really enjoyed Cadigan's earlier novels, such as Synners, but this one really did not measure up."
2,Eh,"Lots of cyberpunk cliches, characters I didn't enjoy, and worst of all, an ending that just hangs there. It doesn't end, it just stops. I can handle a fair bit of ambiguity in fiction, but there has to be enough payoff to make it work."
3,"Good, Just Not Great","I thoroughly enjoy reading Cyberpunk / Sci-Fi, as well as Modern and Classic Literature, and Mysteries - and with that said, I liked ""Tea From An Empty Cup"". I received it as a requested gift for Xmas. It was certainly not as great to me as ""Snow Crash"" or ""Neuromancer"", but nonetheless, good. If you're a Cyberpunk purist, you may dislike this novel because it mixes a somewhat-noir mystery into a cyberpunk world, but I enjoyed that. However, the soliloquies / inner dialogues of the protagonists in each story were ackward and not believable."
3,Read this book,"I understood half the ending... :) (Possibly a little more, three quarters maybe.) Pat Cadigan can write far better than most sci fi writers, & this book is very worth reading. But it's still not as good as her others."
2,An ambitious but confused haphazard jumble.,"There's not much to recommend this tale. The main characters seem lost most of the time which explains why the reader was as well.The extension of the AR ""hotsuits"" to faster levels through the use of drugs served no notable purpose. The imagery was tattered and scattered. I felt no particular interest or sympathy for any of the players.I would recommend that you pass this anxious turmoil by and hope that Cadigan's next effort has better focus and depth."
1,"""Tea"" lacks the depth and originality of earlier works","I was incredibly dissapointed with Tea from an Empty Cup. The progression that was started with Mindplayers, Synners, and Fools led me to expect a richly developed world full of interesting characters and paranoias. Tea just did not deliver. I kept waiting for more, and found myself hoping the ending would justify the seemingly aimless romp through AR. Sadly, it didn't. Those new to Cadigan's work may enjoy this work, but you may be better off trying Synners on for size."
3,Cyberpunk snackfood,"This is the first book I've read by Pat Cadigan. While it was a pleasant enough read, it hasn't convinced me to go out and devour all her other novels. The book is relatively short and easy to read, even though she jumps between the viewpoints of two characters. I felt she did a good job moving between the two storylines, but also felt she could have gone alot more indepth into both the characters and the story. For the majority of the book she is clear and the storyline understandable, but the ending seemed abrupt and didn't resolve the story to my satifaction (I found myself asking ""Is that all?""). However, I would still recommend this book, especially if you're a cyberpunk fan."
1,A Bad Dream,"I really hated this book. Usually when I dislike a book this much I just stop reading it, but I continued to expect that what I was reading was the set-up and that then the book would start.It has absolutely no character development. It consists almost entirely of dream-like disjointed, unconnected vignettes. So it doesn't have a story either! You couldn't like or dislike any of the characters because you learned absolutely nothing about them. I also thought that it was scientifically implausible, e.g. an 'artifical reality body suit' that could simulate the experience of breaking bones. It purports to be a detective story where the action takes place in ""Artificial Reality"" (AR), but I think that, at best, it was Artificial Lucid Dreaming (ALD). Or, perhaps it was mostly a full sensory electronic game and I certainly felt like I was reading a detailed description of someone's play of a video game - even more boring than watching someone play or playing a game yourself."
5,"CELINE DION ""Unison"" ... the beginning of something big!","This is one of Celine's rarest CD singles.Tracks are as followed with a brief description...1.UNISON REMIX this is the single version and the musiv video version as well. Includes a rap dialogue in the middle. As heard on the ""Unison"" VHS.2.DELIVRE-MOIFrom the ""Incognito"" album in 1988. Was a single and had a music video. A dance theme song.3.CAN'T LIVE WITH YOU, CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU (with Billy Newton-Davis). When you first saw Celine it was probably in this video. Not a hit, but sure a raritie to have on CD!4.UNISONThis is the album version.Get this CD if you can! It's a raritie!"
4,Great,This is working out well. I am careful with it when retracting the cords as it does seem a bit fragile but other that just being gentle with it it is working perfectly.
2,"No game, mad katz wireless gamecube controller","I bought three of them, I already had one that turned out to be much better quality than these that I bought. The controllers pick up each other's signals and switch between player 1, 2, 3, and 4. Yes they even pick up the signal of the one I already had. They do this randomly without warning. They also do not respond very well. Several times, we push buttons or use the joystick yet the game does not do what the controller is doing. This does not happen as often as the signal switching. Overall unsatisfied with this product."
1,don't waste your money,"where i live, it's hard to find a wavebird in stores, so i settled on this one. Big Mistake. after only a few days, the control sticks were sticking making moving around extremely difficult. spend the extra 10 or 15 bucks and get a wavebird, because this controller is not worth 5."
5,The gamecube wireless remote,"I purchased this for my daughter so she could play with her brothers. She loves it, they love it. Thank you."
3,Never buy from this distributor again!,"The controller is very small, but functions. I would never purchase another item from this company/distributor. I paid $10.99 for express shipping - didn't receive the item for almost a week. The item was shipping w/in the same state it was to be delivered. Should never have opted for Express shipping with this company."
1,"Great form, poor quality","I would give these 5 stars if they actually worked. I don't care that they don't have rumble. I had 2 of these. After about of month of use, the analog stick stopped working...on both controllers in 2 different gamecube games. I was very disappointed. I love the way these feel in my hands. That's the only reason I still gave this 1 star. To be fair though, the ones I had were actually Gamestop branded. However, I'm pretty sure they were made by Madcatz for Gamestop."
3,I'm confused. No channel switching???,"I loved this controller. When I got one of these, it was beige and didn't have a channel switching. It was the same Madcatz 330 wireless Gamecube Controller. Will it be able to play in multiplayer, like in supersmash bros where there is about 2-4 players, or will it get confused and mess up everyone's control? Anyway, Because of this, I docked 1 star. Another reason was the size. For my opinion, it was too compact. A little hard to reach the start button. But, still great. Please answer my question [...] or post a comment! Thanks! =P"
3,Smaller Wireless,"There is just so much you can enjoy within a wireless controller. Mad Catz, has created some very well received controllers that have worked very well, but their wireless controller doesn't have the appeal I thought it was going to be. Although the controller is convient and smaller than the traditional Gamecube controller, but there are some problems this controller has. One of them is that there is no rumble feedback in the controller, and another one is that you have to reset the controller to neutral at times which is more often than should be. This isn't that bad, but if you want to go wireless, try gtting the wireless wavebird controller for the Gamecube instead.Price: B-Convience: C 1/2-Overall: C"
1,Defective?,"This would work fine for a game that does not demand real-time input, but for any type of action game, it's a terrible choice.Every minute or so, it stops sending the signal to the receiver for a few seconds. That's no fun in a fighting game, or any action or fast puzzle game."
2,Worked Great - NOW Not Working,"I bought 2 of these this past Christmas, and they worked fine from the get-go. (I did miss the rumble feature not available on these models, however.) Now after nearly 4 months, 1 of the controllers rarely works. I have changed out the batteries many times with no success. It has been frustrating, to say the least. Now I am looking to buy a new wireless controller, but I am leery to buy the same model."
4,"Love lack of wires, but too small","Since the GameCube is known for have wires which are way too short (like all rooms are dorm rooms), having a wireless controller is a huge benefit. The only complaint that I have is that the controller is too small. If you have kids under 14, then this is a good controller for them. Anyone else will have trouble holding the controller and definitely get frustrated trying to squeeze their thumbs between the joysticks to get to the START button."
1,Not what it used to be and mine already broke.,"People are right, this is not the same controller it used to be. I have one of the older versions of this controller and it had the rubber grips on the sides and lasted for years.This one doesn't have the rubber grips and after one week the buttons are already quitting on me.Don't buy this POS."
1,Don't bother wasting your money on these,You'll be lucky if they work. I stupidly bought two of these. So far one has stopped working and the other doesn't actually bother acknowledging that you have pressed a button half the time.
1,Cheap controller,"Cheaply made controller that works 15% of the time straight out of the box. Left control stick ""strays"" & doesn't work even after resetting controller. I'm going to return & get another Pelican cordless."
4,Works great,This is a good value and the replacement controller works great. My kids wear out controllers but you can always get a replacements.
1,The motor broke and now its useless!,"I used this pump less than 10 times with my first child and just got it out to use with my second since I'm engorged and found out the motor is broken. I'm very disappointed since I trusted the Medela name. If I could afford it, I'd replace it with the Pump-in-Style, but unfortunately, I'll have to try a manual pump."
2,good,It took me forever to get this product but when I got it it did the job. The suction power is good and it does the job well. I am overall happy with the product but I did not use it as much as I thought I would.
1,Not so great pump,I bought the Medela pump thinking it was a good quality pump as well; however after only 3 months of use the suction was not working at all. I'm looking for a new replacement now. Don't invest money in this expensive pump.
3,"It is ok, but now I am investing in the Pump In Style","I purchased this pump when my first child was just a few months old (summer 2004). After pumping using a manual pump I was pleased to get around twice the amount of milk in one sitting. I used the pump once a day for just a few months and put it away for the next child.I am now on baby #2 and after only 5 months of using this pump (once a day) for the second baby I am having problems. First I had problems with the pump sucking milk into the machine. After cleaning the machine and tubes I tried to re-use the pump, however the pump has lost a great deal of suction and I can only use it effectively on one side at a time. Even while only pumping on one side I can still only pump around half the amount I as able to before.While this pump did work for 10 months total, it still wasn't worth it to me.I just ordered the Pump In Style as I have heard rave reviews about that one."
2,Bad experience,"I bought this pump the day I was discharged from the hospital (12/11/05). I have used it on a part time basis since I am staying home and nurse directly. However, the motor broke and couldn't pump anymore. My baby is only 5 months and this pump already broke. I have only used it during nights to keep a storage for my baby. I was lucky to call Medela on time since this pump is still under its 6 month warranty period so I could get my money back."
3,"Very noisy, not a great product...","I didnt expect perfection from this pump, but sheesh! This pump is quite loud and since the suction is not great, you are stuck having to listen to nothing but noise while pumping. The noise scares the baby, so I cant be in the same room with him while using the pump either. I dont hate this product, but I am glad it was a gift and that I didnt use my money for it."
4,Very Good Buy,I am a first time mother and I have found this to be a very good pump. I have a two week old and I pump in between her feeding from the breast and I get about 4 oz in 10 min most times and I think that is great for a newborn and the short time that I have been pumping. This system is very easy to use and even though it says it's for occasional use you can pump as much as you want with this pump. I just didn't see the point to getting the $300 system since I new I wouldn't be breastfeeding for more than 6 months exclusively.
2,Don't count on this pump for more than one pregnancy,"I purchased this pump with my first pregnancy and it worked great. With my second pregnancy a year later, it lost suction right away and was worthless to me. I tried all the trouble shooting suggestions, cleaning with warm water, alcohol etc, but nothing brought the suction back. I contacted the company, but they suggested I buy a new pump - I suggest spending the extra money on the Pump in Style from the beginning."
4,Good pump,I decided to by this pump instead of the single because it saves time to do both sides at once. This pump works very well and I quickly get the milk I need. I like that there are different levels of suction to fit my comfort. I gave it four stars because it is a little difficult to change speeds and adjust with both hands being occupied. Sometimes one side looses suction and while I am trying to fix it the other side looses suction because I had to remove my hand from holding it in place.
1,NO STARS!,"Don't waste your money! My pump doesn't even work! I have not even been able to use it at all. I bought it only because I love my big Medela. It just does not work at all. There is barely any suction. I have not even been able to get out an ounce. In fact, I have to use my manual one instead. I am so unhappy with it and can't even get my money back because of health issues."
5,Excellent way to capture you family history,"I have to say...this video is an excellent demonstration on how to, document on film, your family history. My grandmother passed away on Christmas Eve 2008 & I did not get to capture everything I had hoped to. However, we did get some on Thanksgiving & were ever so grateful.It is so sad to see when we lose the people we love & realize we have no way to ask them what their lives were like, how times were ""way back when,"" how each person is related & so on. You will learn wonderful tips to make your experience unique & priceless. Don't wait like I did & miss your opportunity to share the knowledge of our elders with those we love & our upcoming generations. I was surprised to find it easy & affordable. I checked into hiring a private videographer in different areas however, decided I would try it for myself. That's how I ended up getting this video.I really believe, if we can do it you can."
1,Avoid anything from SonicClue/Rio......,"I've bought three different MP3 players from this company (including two of the SP250) and they have all been defective. They work for a couple months (just past warranty time) and then just ""stop working"" - no fix available. Getting customer support at Sonic Blue/Rio is impossible. Buyer Beware - do your research."
2,a definate NOT BUY,"This product is the lowest quality of all. My first one stopped recognizing MP3 cds. I sent it, (paying 15$). The second one just randomly stopped working.i sent that one back, my 3rd one now has a major problem with the earphone sockets. and after playing an mp3 cd for a few times, it stops to recognize the songs.very very low chinese manufactured product. buy a sony/panasonic one. this one will make you sad..."
1,sleek looking but bad in functioning,"it only looks good. the equalizer has no effect on the sound and is useless. the batteries run out in almost 4-5 hours. the 8 mins buffer is filled if u keep the player in place for some time, so if u are jogging after 8 mins it will start to skip. the customer support is worse than the player itself. first no 800 telephone number to call, when i called their long island number no body picked up nor there was any answering machine. the people never replied to any of my emails which i send 30 days ago. so its a total ripoff. wait for some better player."
1,lasts 2 months,"Actually, Im not an electronics fan, and I don't know too much about electronics, but I saw this ...and bought it mainly because it had the most skip protection of all the cd players [I found]. I brought it home, tried it out.... nevermind jogging, it skipped when i simply walked with it! But I kept it, since I could still listen to it lifting weights. It worked great at the gym for 2 months, then suddenly stopped working. A[n expensive]purchase that only works for 2 months? Give me a break. That's rediculous. ..."
2,"Great Product, but very, very susceptible to Terminal Damage","I have had the player for about 10 months, and had no complaints. It was great: it remembered where I left off, had rechargeable batteries, had a remote, never skipped when I used it in the car. But...when I was re-arranging my living room and it slipped out of my hand 2-feet above a wooden floor, it broke its left hinge and has not powered on since then. I checked the Hold settings, took the thing apart, and even contacted support via e-mail. The small fall must've damaged its circuit board. Oh well...I still have working 8-track players, quadrophonic sound systems (yes, those things from the 70s), and near new Commodore computers. So, why is it that a 2-foot fall can damage this? Who knows...So much for the one-year warranty...my MPTrip *still* works, and it's been banged around quite a bit. (MPTrip was the first generation MP3 CD player.)"
2,Wouldn't buy it if I could do it again.,"I have never been more frustrated by a machine, except for a rio mp3 player that I bought a long time ago. I just want it to play what I put into it, but the machine refuses! It will randomly reset your music when your listening to it. Also, the shock protection is sub par to the sony cd players that came out 5 years ago. Overall, the design of this machine is untested and juvenile - coming from an engineer..."
1,Good for 30 Days,"I received this unit as a Christmas gift. It ran fine until the return/exchange period ran out. A few days after that, it started skipping. This surprised me since my wife's SP100 runs flawlessly. Rio customer support is useless."
1,Didn't work,"I bought one of these things from Amazon and it never worked. Not for one second. I let the batteries charge all night and it still wouldn't boot up. I tried different rechargeable batteries, but it made no difference. Between this and my Rio 500 which had to be RMAed 3 times, I'm starting to think Rio specializes in great ideas that they don't know how to make work. I'm moving on to the Creative Nomad IIc. Hopefully I'll have better luck with that."
2,So So,"When I first received the RioVolt in the box, I must admit it looked very damn impressive. I was astonished by the display, and all the options it had, and the 8-minute anti skip. I also loved that it came with rechargeable batteries, and that they would last long. So, when I got it, I charged up the batteries and started listening to it during the days. I was amazed when the batteries ran dry on me in UNDER 3 hours. The player has gotten progressively worse since then. I can't walk from one end of a room to another without it skipping every time I take a footstep. It's a nice player, but it really doesn't do what I expected. I used to own a little Panasonic CD player, with 40 sec anti skip, and only played CD's (not mp3's) I could mow my whole lawn (over an hour of walking) and it would never skip, and batteries lasted at least 25 hours. So if you're considering spending a lot of money, I'd suggest a nice Panasonic CD player, better bang for your buck."
2,"Short battery, slow boot up, awkward controls","Battery maxs out at 4 hours. Takes about 10 seconds to start playing. Very confusing control on player and on head phone. I got this because it is the only few CD, MP3 with FM tuner. The most annoying problem is the short battery life."
3,Good BUT BREAKS SO EASILY THAT IT LAST ABOUT 1 MONTH,"When I first got this cd player I thought, ""Wow. This is the best cd/mp3 player around."" But then about a month later the smallest little thing breaks off and it doesn't work. I thought, ""Maybe I will buy a new one and take extra special care of it."" This time, nothing happened to it and it stopped working again. I wouldn't recommend buying this, but I gave it 3 stars because if it wasnt so poorly made it would be the coolest thing out there."
1,Worthless MP3 player.,"If you're thinking of buying the SonicBlue RioVolt SP250, think again. I've had nothing but problems with mine from day one. It had trouble reading my mp3 cds, which equates to long (30sec-1.5minute) startup time. That was just the beginning. It skipped all the time while driving around in my car. I haven't had a cd player that skipped for a long time, and my fried just bought a sony mp3 player that doesn't skip at all. This was all fairly disappointing when, wham, the worst thing of all. The electronic faceplate is screwed into plastic underneath the flip-up lid. After about 5-6 months of use, the screws broke free of the threads, and the electronic plate would touch the spinning cd when I pressed the play/stop/ffd button. About 4 months after that, the whole plate fell off and was just sitting on the cd. Needless to say, it doesn't work anymore.I'm now in communication with their support, which is pretty much worthless as well."
5,MP3 Players Eat Your Heart Out,"This revolutionary product is state of the art technology. (...) It took me a while to open the package, but the product was brand new and stylish. It plays mp3 and wma files easily without problems and it has 8 minutes of shock protection that blows the comp away. Throw in an fm digital tuner, software, a carrying case, earphones, earplugs, a remote control, LCD display screen, an AC adapter and Over 20hrs of music playback with rechargeable batteries that last over 15 hours and you got yourself a steal.The only other thing I wish this product came with was the LCD remote control instead of the standard. I just got mine yesterday and am still testing it out. All in all I say this is a great product and an investment.NEW YORK CITY FOR LIFEHolla!!!!!!!"
1,"Great Features & Sound Quality, But Build Quality is BAD!","I've had this player for about 2 months now and the left corner hinge of the lid has broken off completely while I was closing the lid and now the lid is loose!What's more, 3 of the mounts for the screws inside the player that hold it together have broken as well! I havn't once dropped this player or mishandled it. 3 of the screws are now missing and I have to keep it in it's case for fear of it falling apart.However, I MUST say that the Features and Sound Quality from this player are FANTASTIC! If only they'd used higher quality plastic in making it.I've sent SONICblue an email about it and they said it sounds like I received ""a defective unit..."" and I'm now awaiting a reply about the RMA request; it's been 3 days.I would suggest you buy something else...and save yourself the hassle and waste of money with this one. I regret ever buying the RioVolt SP250! :-("
1,Not for the active,"I give this player one star because the anti-skipping does not work. I like to take long walks and listen to books or music. I bought this player so that I could put an entire book on one CD. Actually you can put a bunch. But when you try to listen to mp3s or regular CDS while walking, it skips alot. The only way that you can walk and listen is if you walk very, very, very slow and hold theplayer in the palm of your hand so that it is horizontal to the ground. I've gone back to my 3 year old Philips Magnovox CD player with its 45 second anti-skip because it does work, although I have to use multiple CDS again for listening to a book."
2,"Great features, poor durability","Pros:1. good sound2. large LCD display3. host of useful featuresCons:1. poor durability2. bulky3. uncomfortable buttonsThis player lasted me seven days. I was pretty happy with it until it started displaying NO DISK with any CD(R), audio or MP3. Looks like a very unreliable less expensive piece of plastic stuffed with expensive electronics.If you're willing to gamble (and go through the return/exchange wait), this may be the best unit out there ... if it doesn't break down within a week/month that is."
4,Excellent but...,"It's an excellent product, and as others posted here.So I will just focus on the cons:1) VBR: The ""remain time"" shown on the LCD for VBR mp3 files are not accurate. The SP250 will always overestimate the total time for VBR files.2) the total quality. I connect the line out to my Yamaha receiver, and play a max 320bps VBR lame-3.89 compressed ""Hotel California XRCD"", compare to the DTS DVD version. I can still notice the difference, which I believe not because of the mp3, but the player itself."
1,My Worst NIghtmare!!!1,I got this for christmas last year and within 2 days it broke and i didnt drop it or anything! Also just to get it fixed would cost another $100! Its the worst player i had ever had i would stay away far away!
1,DONT BUY IT,"I GOT THIS MP3 PLAYER FOR CHRISTMAS, IN A COUPLE OF DAYS IT BROKE. WHAT HAPPENDED WAS THAT THE CD WASNT FULLY IN THE SLOT SO WHEN I PRESS ""PLAY"" IT SAYS ""NO CD."" WELL I THINK NO BIG DEAL AND I PUT THE CD IN CORRECTLY, BUT WHEN I GO TO PRESS ""PLAY"" IT WONT WORK! I TRIED PUTTING IN NEW BATTERIES, USING THE AC ADAPTER, I TRIED EVERYTHING, BUT NOTHING SEEMED TO WORK. SO I RETURNED IT. ALSO THE CONTROLS FOR IT ARE VERY CONFUSING, THERE ISN'T EVEN AN OFF BUTTON, YOU HAVE TO OPEN IT TO TURN IT OFF. THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND IS GOOD, BUT IT HAS NO BASS AT ALL THE FM TUNER CANT PICK UP ANY SIGNALS, SO BASICALLY THIS CD/MP3 PLAYER IS HORRIBLE. GO FOR ANOTHER ONE OF RIO'S PRODUCTS LIKE THERE MINI MP3 PLAYERS. [....]"
2,MP3/WMA on CDR/CDRW pops and skips!!!,"MP3 burned on to CDR/CDRW have pops and skips when playing. Unbearable! MP3/WMA are at all good to high qualities on my pc. Upgraded firmware to 2.05 but did not help.FM turner is very good. Good reception. Playing regular CD is also pretty good. Nice leather case, rechargeable batteries, adapter, headphones, etc.Don't buy this if you're looking for MP3/WMA player. You'll be very disappointed!!!"
2,"Low Cost, Low Quality","I previously bought a RioVolt SP90, and it took a SLIGHT fall, no more than one foot, and the latch broke, and it stopped working. So I worked for a month and a half last summer, & bought a SP250. It too took a slight fall (off my bed--abt 1 1/2 feet) and refused to work--it doesnt go past the power ON screen. So, I am looking @ High-Capacity MP3 players. They are more compact, and probably wont break as easily. So in closing--the RioVolt SP250 & the RIOVOLT SP90 getTwo Thumbs Down"
2,CD rotation produces noise-interference,"The features are great, as other reviews say, but when you play an audio CD, the CD-rotating motor creates electronic noise in the playback. It is particularly noticeable (intolerable) when the anti-shock buffer fills after about 1 minute, and the rotation slows somewhat -- it sounds like a little steam-engine railroad. It's bad enough to give you a headache. I am returning it...! If you want your audio to be free of motor interference, get something else."
4,falling apart,"I have had this product for about a year and a half. The product has worked flawlesly but this weekend I noticed that the screws that hold the metal plate on the inside top cover were falling out. When I tried to replace the screws they wouldn't stay in place. I removed the cover to see what the problem was and found that the plastic that the screws were anchored in was breaking apart. At first only one screw was a problem but when I put the unit back together two more broke! I have now glued the plate back on and it works great but if something happens and I have to remove the plate I'm ""screwed"" :-) Other than that this unit has performed flawlessly over the long haul. I would rate it 5 stars except for the screw problem."
3,RioVolt SP250,"I've had this for over a year now and used it very little for several reasons. First, it's big and bulky and very akward to carry. Secondly, it eats batteries when used for playing CD's Thirdly, the radio reception is unacceptable. While the sound is very good, and the anti-skip feature works really, really well I would not purchase this again because of the drawbacks and because it's also quite [costly]."
5,Wonderful!,"This item is great. I loved the mp3/wma reading. The eass is very impressive. All in all, I just LOVED it."
3,One fatal flaw,"This is a pretty good CD player, with, of course, the cool features you buy it for--MP3, WMA playback, FM radio, remote control, carry case.I'd like to note that the anti-skip does not work well if the CD is vertical, as it would be in your pocket while you're *walking*. Yes, it skips even then.But the thing that really sinks it as a reference product is the fact that it can't play through a segue between tracks without inserting a several millisecond pause between the tracks. It's very brief, but there's no play mode I've found that can prevent this from happening.If you don't listen to classical music, art rock, techno, ambient, or Broadway, this may not be an issue for you. But if you still want to play *Dark Side of the Moon*? Forget it!"
1,RIOVOLT - CUSTOMER NO SERVICE,"Purchased an SP250 in December. Poorly designed lid latch broke in January. Tech Support indicated they were having problems with that....product is so far out on back order no idea when it could be replaced under warranty. Tech was supposed to send email with return instructions and RMA (Return MErchandise Authorization) next day. It is now February and still waiting. Company Tech Support number is permanently busy...then they forward you to a related company to tell you they can't pull up the support case on their system. But if I wait a few more days, they will send me an RMA.....Their support is nonexistent!!"
1,Absolute Garbage,"This product is worthless. I returned mine within 2 weeks. It would not read MP3s reliably in any sense. Every CD I tried with it was a new adventure. In addition, the player would often just die on me. Now, I am now waiting for a reputable manufacturer to produce a reliable product."
1,What?!?,"This is by far the best CD player on the market...until the day it dies...I was showing someone how great the CD player is, and when I went to play the CD, it wouldn't play...I got this CD player for Xmas, and its already broken..."
3,I've had one for a year,"I was issued this player when I began my training. It is a pretty good player. It comes with 2 sets of headphones. AC adapter, rechargable batteries, carrying case, remote, and some software. I don't really believe it is worth the money for what I use it for. I don't use the radio. I only use it to listen to music now and used it to listen to MP3 files on discs issued to me for class. I think it is a bit ridiculous to have an 8 minute shock protection, especially when mine skips when I run. I had to stop it and didn't even use it the last time I ran because it was skipping so bad. I have dropped mine a few times and now it makes a funny noise when the cd rotates, but it still works. I know people who have said that it is easy to break the plastic. I know someone who has to use a rubber band to keep it closed. I think it is a nice player, however I am very disappointed in the 8 minute skip protection that doesn't work, I really don't think it is worth the price."
1,Not good,"If you are looking into buying a Mp 3 player DON'T buy this one. I had it for two years and I had to replace it onced beacouse of the cheap plastic. The plastic tab that closes the cd player just snaped off. Plus sometimes when you hit a bump in a road or when u shake it up it will start skiping. I really think that if you are interested in a Mp 3 player, Cd player and a radio player you should look for diffrent one."
3,Be careful!,"I got one of these a couple months ago, and it was great. Everything I could have wanted in an mp3 cd player, it was just plain cool. Then disaster struck. It broke and no one will replace it. Becareful, it isn't the sturdiest thing in the world, other than that, go for it."
3,Nice features but not good for exercise.,After looking around for a while for a quality cd/mp3 player I went with the SP250. On many websites the reviews for this player are outstanding which I agree with in some aspects. The features in the player are over the top. Everything you can ask for in a CD/MP3 player are here. My major complaint and it was a big one with me is the the player seemed to skip everytime I went running. Casually walking was fine but once you start moving in a running pace is was like playing a scratched CD skipping over and over. To sum it up... If you run a lot this player might not be for you.
1,Use Caution when dealing with Sonicblue,"I have purchased both the SP 90, and the SP 250. While both these units work well, I had the inclination to contact Sonicblue regarding a free car kit adapter offer that is prominently displayed on the package. After numerous emails, phone calls that resulted in the same message, ""we are experiencing a high volume of calls, please try again later"" or a constant busy signal, I wrote to the CEO of Sonicblue. To date, I have received no response, nor do I expect one.I had read reviews that described the extremely poor customer service and thought the person just had a bad experience and ordered the product anyway. This was not the best decision I have made. The products works fine ....for now. If I have the need for service, I realize this is not an option from Sonicblue.Use caution when dealing with Sonicblue."
2,Poor Construction/ Poor Warrenty,"I think the options and updatable firmware are great, but that's as far as the praise goes. Mine slid off my knee, while sitting on a couch, and landed on a carpeted floor one foot below. The plastic of which the item's made, broke in three places (two of which were the door hinges). So I wrigged it to work, but a few months later out of the blue it wouldn't read the disc past the loading screen. I explained the above event to tech support and they informed me that the ""drop"" voided the warrenty. I'm very displeased with this expensive cd player."
1,Disappointing,This product was written up in a health magazine as being good for work outs. It fails that test and fails to function during jogging. Customer service siad the product should work fine if I put it on a flat table. That's obviously not what I bought it for.
1,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!,I got this thing for X-mas i thought it was gonna be soooo good ok the software it came with was really confusing and im really good with computers so that didnt work i had to keep using reg 80min cds and it was so cheaply made a always had the case on i droped it once ON CARPET from about 3 feet it broke 4 skrews fell out so if i press any buttons it hits the disk AHHHH and it DOES NOT have 8 min ESP its only about 1 min DONT BUY THIS go with a mp3 jukebox way better!!!
1,skip skip,"8 minutes anti-skip! try again. as i walk (slowly) with this thing, it skips. Constantly skipping. Then when trying to recharge it takes forever to figure out how to.Piece of @#$. i would not recommend this. I got a better CD player for free! Don't waste your money"
2,Weak Portable CD player,"I purchased this CD player to use while exercising. Unless you are walking, it skips constantly. The remote does not work well and is not user friendly. The multiple functions are basically useless. The headphones are terrible. I would have returned this item if I had not kept it over 30 days."
3,Rio Revolt SP 250,"Product worked well for a year then just completely quit, had to be replaced by an MP3 player."
2,"Good looks, but Cheap Product","Looks wise, i prefer this over the Iriver players, as the Text display is builtin the player itself, not the remote.However, the if you turn the player too much, like while running, or keep it upside down for long, it shuts down. Also, it has little trouble reading MP3 cd's with too many folders in them.Lastly, the metal plate inside which opens the player gets easily damaged over a few months, if used often."
3,Unpolished experience,"I really like the 3d environments. The game has some strong concepts, but there are too many things that detract from the original worms experience. The most terrible, as anybody will tell you, is the aiming system. It's near impossible to actually target a specific area, even in first person. The second is the genius of the AI. Hiding in a building with a small hole in the roof is like being out in the open. They will shoot a bazooka full power in the air and have it come through the hole and hit you in the face for full damage. This only compounds the frustration of being unable to target anything. The multiplayer experience is more fun since you both suffer from the same handicap, but the action isn't near as fast-paced as 2-d worms. I can't help but feel that if Team 17 had spent a little more time with this before releasing it that it might have actually been enjoyable. As it is, I wouldn't recommend it unless you can pick it up cheap."
5,Look at the weapons!,"This game rocks!You can create a worm team,create a special weapon,and create a game mode.If you played Worms 3-D or Forts Under Seige,you will love this game!Highly recommended!"
1,Don't be an Early Bird!,"If you've never played a worms game, you're lucky. This has got to be the most retarded game I've ever seen, and I've beaten Bubble Bobble! The graphics are terrible, not to mention the game is in slow motion. Of course if you've always loved the worms series, go for it."
1,This book is bad!,I love vampire books but I just could not finish this book at all. HORRIBLE! Stay away from this book.
1,Steer clear of this one...,"I get the impression that the author has spent more time watching TV than reading books. This reads like a bad made for TV movie. The character development is a mess. She paints a picture of a certain type of person, and then that person says or does something totally out of context for the type of character being portrayed. The writing style is extremely annoying too. Constant attempts at creating drama with short paragraphs. E.G.:""This author wrote a bad book.""""Again.""""And she knows it!"""
3,Meh.,"This had been on my book shelf for ages, and it had come highly recommended. It looks like a stylish vampire story, but... it kind of falls short.The good:The humor. There are some pretty funny scenes.The horror. These vampires aren't cute fluffy bunny vamps.The ideas. Cacek has a lot of clever ideas about vampire lore.The bad:The editing. It's horrible--lots of misspelled words, even misnumbered pages.The tone. The feel of the story is really uneven. It's kind of like a cross between MaryJanice Davidson's Betsy stories and Ann Rice, and it's not sure which it wants to be.The plot. There are a lot of threads that are left up in the air: a huge buildup to how to make a human servant, and then it's just dropped; lots of talk about the heroine not knowing anything about being a vampire, but she never learns, either.The verdict:It seems fairly amateurish, but also the kind of book that people will praise very highly because of that."
1,It was different alright..,"I love vampire books and couldn't wait to read this one after the reviews I read always touted it as ""different"". Well, it was, but not in a good way. The seedy side of L.A. was just plain disgusting, the sex was raunchy, not sexy, the attempts at humor failed, and the characters were nowhere."
1,Adapter doesn't work,"I bought thadapter so that I could use it on long trips on airplanes. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. It appears that the connection sleeve is too long to allow the contacts to connect with the outlet on the plane. I tried it in several outlets (seats) that were providing power to other passenger's computers on a United flight from Hong Kong to San Francisco...it didn't work. Save your money."
5,"Angel First Aid, Rx for Miracles","Going to work and school full-time is very stressful. This book has been extremely beneficial in helping me to keep on track. Doing the techniques and saying the affirmations helps me to focus and continue working toward my goals. Since using Angel First Aid, I feel more balanced and in tune with my plans for the future. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get ahead and stay ahead."
1,Distorted historical Nonsense,This book has been downgraded to fiction by the publisher.William Stephenson's fantasies transcribed by his biographer.Of no historical value whatever.
3,Forrest Gump,"Five stars if it was true. One star if it's not true. So I give three stars because no one knows if it's true or not. The history is fabulous and amazing. But this fellow doesn't back up anything. Shouldn't there be some government documents or something to prove at least a few of the fantastic statements regarding Intrepids role in WWII history? Intrepid seems more like a literary tool, used to link together stories from history in a readable way. Kind of like Forrest Gump. Again, I liked the book, if it were true. I'm just not sure I believe it."
1,Better Reading,"This is a very important subject, but this is an inaccurate unsourced book - a fictionalized version of true events. For the real story - foreworded by the CIA's staff historian, read the Canadian Bill Macdonald's 'sourced' book ""The True Intrepid."""
4,"Interesting if true, and interesting anyway.","As I read this book of intelligence activities, misdirection and propaganda, I wondered how much of it I was now being subjected to. I enjoyed the book but I'm not sure I believe all of it. Some of the pictures look like movie stills. The information contained may be just a little too out there. I'm certain resistance fighters had to be very careful in their attire and cover identities, but I have doubts that anyone, even those nefarious Nazis could identify a piece of gravel as being from London specifically, or if they would even take the time to do that, as stated in the book. I did enjoy reading it, but take it with a grain of salt."
3,GOOD BOOK,"This product arrived as described. Shipped quickly, packaged neatly, and a good price. I am satisfied with this purchase. This is a great book, you will learn about how WWII was really won, and the aftermath that split the US and the Soviets as allies."
5,A Man Called Intrepid,"If you are a WWII buff this book is a must in reading. It tells the story of how important our spying network was in this epic battle, and how and why stealing the Enigma machine from the Nazi's affected the outcome our war effort. Never before, and probably never again will 2 countries be coupled together in the effort of spying as was England and the USA. William Stephenson in truly a modern day hero, and I'll bet most of you never heard of him.A must read.Don BohringerWestmont, IL."
5,A Man Called Intrepid,"This book is an absolute read if you are a fan of the World War II and any one who wishes to understand why the days prior to USA getting into the war were so difficult for our leaders.I was never a fan of Franklin D. Roosevelt,but he was the right man at the time and he did the correct thing to help save England and the United States of America.Thank God we had men like Stevenson, Donovan, Churchill and Roosevelt or we would have Hitler as our ruler.I have read it twice the past thirty years and find new and exciting information each time."
1,A Man Called Intrepid is largely fiction,"William Stephenson was never named ""Intrepid"" by Winston Churchill or by anyone else, until 1976 when the book was published. Stephenson did not work for Churchill, infact it is unlikely that he ever met him. The shadowy figure with Churchill in the ruins of the House of Commons is Brendan Bracken, a minister in the Cabinet. Most of the other pictures in the book are from an English movie about 1948 vintage called, ""A School for Spies"". I was the first person in North America to challenge the authenticity of this book, my early findings were published in the Vancouver Province newspaper in October 1984. After which I researched further and substantiated many more of its glaring errors. I also learned that it had also been thoroughly discredited in the UK. If you are interested I can provide all the information mentioned here and much much more besides. Denis Mason, Vancouver, B.C. (604) 926 2801 denmason@smarttnet.com"
5,Back On Track,"I was so disappointed with David Ball's Amigo because I did not think it a worthy follow-up to Play and Thinking Problem, and I was worried that David Ball had lost his way, but Freewheeler sets him back on course. I have never yet heard a CD in which every song is great, like so many reviews claim. I only ask a couple questions after I purchase a CD: am I glad I bought it? Was it worth the money? Are there songs that I will be listening to a year, five years, ten years from now? The answer in this instance is an unqualified ""yes"" to all three. Not every song is great, but there are some absolutely terrific ones."
5,La voir et l'écouter,Ce dvd est un enchantement de bout en bout. Le charme et la presence de BB restent aussi envoutants apres toutes ces annees.
3,"unplayable on USA dvd player, requires a PAL player.","I received this DVD in perfect looking condition and expected itto play without any problems because it was new and in a sealedwrapper. I was very surprised to find that all dvd players report"" DISK ERROR, UNPLAYABLE ""I dug out my foreign ""PAL"" player and it plays. I did not see anynotice of this dvd being in ""PAL"" only format.The video is a good overview of her singing and dancing talents.She is a very talented woman and her beauty adds to the video."
5,Transcendental Consciousness,"Are you asking the question why you are here? Are you looking for meaning in your life? Of course you are, otherwise you would not be reading this now. In my hectic living, such questions continued to appear and eventually I was obliged to pay attention. Nisargadatta Maharaj was one of the first I stumbled upon, not only with the answers but the key for opening much deeper questioning. In this context enlightenment can be seen as a journey, a journey out of the madness of our own creation to a clearer space. During that time, Nisargadatta'a work 'I AM THAT' was my constant companion, the transcendental consciousness beckoning to the cognitive within enabling the dissolution of self. I deeply acknowledge all who have participated in bringing his message to the world.You are the World"
5,One of the best books I've ever read.,"As a graduate who has a degree in literature and minor in philosophy, I recommend this book. His words offer a refreshing perspective on the subject of spirituality and how one should view themselves and others. It has earned a place on my bookshelf and my guess it will on yours as well. Enjoy the experience . . ."
5,Inspirational book,"I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj is a contemporary spiritual classic with a very direct, no-nonsense style. You may want to read one page at a time and contemplate the meaning of the pearls of wisdom. For instance on page (346) you find this passage - ""In awareness you seek not what pleases, but what is true"". On page (520) you come across this passage, ""True knowledge is ever fresh, new, unexpected. It wells up from within. When you know what you are, you also are what you know. Between knowing and being there is no gap"". Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj is a teacher who will help you come to a better understanding of yourself. He was a simple man who lived a humble life in Bombay until the age of 84. Many people have sought him out while he was alive."
2,seemed like a good book and probably is but...,Good book I think just waaay to bloody expensive! There are / were many more sage's that have just as good book's that don't cost nearly 30$.
2,pretty tough wading,"This is a book that must be trudged through. Seemingly contradictory at times. After a couple of chapters, I decided to wait a few years to attempt it. A lot of assumptions that the reader is familiar with all sanskrit words, but even after being a ""student"" for over 30 years, there was much that left me in the dark.Not much fun"
3,Being is All,"This book consists of dialogues during which Sri Nisargadatta answers in the Spirit. He sees himself as an incarnation of God. He speaks as I AM, not as a person with a gigantic ego. What struck me, was that he said that whether you are sad, suffering or happy, the Universe is unperturbed. It still functions OK.This is in contrast to teachings in The Course in Miracles, where the Course tells us that we are joined, that there is only one mind, and that when we realize our real nature, our brothers and sisters benefit as well.I AM THAT essentially gives us what every God-realized teacher conveys. We are not an ego, we should not work on our selves, because working on the ego is a waste of time. We mustre-discover (i.e., be reborn) ourselves as spirit, or Being. This can be experienced instantly.The dialogues were redundant I felt, because this book could have been much shorter."
1,the last teaching of the 20th century,"What is the true, and perfect enlightment? I AM THAT is showing exactly what we are searching for. Indivual I is not true I. What I believe about myself is not WHAT I AM. What the hell is myself and the world around me?There are endless questions from the state of the indivisual mind and Maharaj is kindly and sometimes cruelly pouring the truth about you and the world.This is only thing you should discover. There is nothing you can search for anymore."
5,A profound book that will stay with the reader a long time.,"Best to consider this book as one which you will consult from time to time for the rest of your life. Perhaps you may read it once only, maybe twice, but just once you should permit its message to permeate your heart. You will not regret it."
5,Simply superb...and a lot of fun to read.,"Rather than writing a bunch of superlatives for this incredible book, I will simply suggest you experience it for yourself...Other excellent books in a similar but different spirit (that will complement your understanding of Advaita) are ""Who Cares?!"" by Ramesh Balsekar, and ""Oneness"" by John Greven."
5,I Am That,"I Am That is a beautiful book of discussions with Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj that prompts one to open their mind and see all things from a different perspective. His philosophy is that the mind and the body are illusory and can be easily disregarded freeing a person from their preoccupations and ultimately freeing yourself of your ""self."" This book should be required reading for the entire human race..."
5,Breathtaking!,"But you really have to focus. But it's worth it. For a more simple but equally as powerful read, check out Live Like A Fruit Fly - also on amazon."
2,you'll need fingerpicking ability,"If you don't fingerpick, your playing won't match the recording. Never. Fred is a good teacher and great in fingerpicking, but since this is a basic book, he shoud play it straight and be honest to the reader, since there isn't any explanation of how to apply this technique, and you're left wondering why the recording sound so better than your playing no matter how faithful you'll be to the tabs.That said, you can get good licks and a blues feel from the amount of licks here. That's it, the rest is complicated because:- scales fingering are lousy explained, there is no indication of which is the root note for example;- there are no double stops theory explanations, just the basic play here and here;- there is a good deal of chords that are thrown but no explained.I was impress with the large content, though. But I wouldn't buy another book of Fred, since they all seen to have this same problem."
3,Nice for general good behaviour but not specifically biting,"From the title you would assume that the book is aimed at discouraging biting - yet there is only 1 page on the subject. It's a cute little book that covers pushing, kicking, spitting, hitting Mommy etc one page at a time. We like the 'Can you remember? - Yes I can' page at the back."
3,Not her best,"This is okay, but not as good as the other Karen Katz books we have. Still a winner - just not a favorite!"
3,Not what I expected,"The review stated that the book was in ""near new"" condition and this was not true. The book had 1 missing page and several wripped pages. Don't know if I will order from this seller again!The book is well written and the baby loves it!"
5,Great help for parents and teachers too!,"We provide assistance to Child Care providers who are including young children who are developing differently. When children don't have much language to express their feelings, wants and needs, they often use their body to communicate. Biting is one of those behaviors that children, especially toddlers use to communicate. Although it's not a socially appropriate behavior, its often expected when we have little ones with language challenges. This book is useful in helping children understand that biting hurts and is not ""ok"". It's easy for teachers (and parents) to use and children get the message quickly when they have repeated access to this type of social teaching."
2,the book is cute but has a misleading title,"Cute book but not just about biting. I wanted a book i could read with my 16 month old so he would start to understand biting is bad.this book has one page that says"" we don't bite or Friends"" the next page says what can we bite? Apples!. Or something like that, all in all its a cute book that shows what is a good and bad versions of behavior, pushing ,hitting ect.. Not really what i was looking for"
4,Fun read,"This book was a little too advanced for our 15 month old, as the flaps in this book are somewhat smaller and more complex and therefore easier to rip off. The concepts are more applicable to an older child as well. We will keep it around to read in a few months, though."
4,good for toddler,We read this story to my grandson who was almost 2 years old and had started biting...He got it right away. I wish you could have seen his face. He was so sad when he looked at the picture of don't bite people...and so happy when he flipped to the picture bite an apple.etc. By the third reading he was repeating the words...and he has not bitten anyone since. It might not work for every child but children are smarter than we think. They really want to learn right from wrong.
2,Not Biting,"This is not a no biting bookOnly 1 page to biting the remaining pagesto other issues, no hitting, sticking your tongue out,and pushing in line."
2,"It all began with ""No Biting""","Unfortunately, my experience with this book was not so positive. My hope was that this book would be a great tool to help my almost 2 year old curb his new biting habit. Instead, the book introduced him to numbers of other negative behaviors, such as kicking our cats, ""trying"" to spit at me, etc. Needless to say, I was disappointed."
3,Don't like intorducing all of these bad behaviors,"My son (who is just under 2) likes to have this book read to him but it's certainly not his favorite book (not even his favorite book if I ask him to get a no biting book). The only behavior problem we struggle with is biting. This book talks about all kinds of ""bad"" beahviors and gives kids an alternative. While I think this is a decent method, I feel like it has introduced the possibilities to my son. (Yes, he will probably witness or think about kicking and spitting and such on his own, but I don't really like that I'm reading about these things to him. So, even if I comment on these behaviors as we read I only read this book to my son if he brings it to me. (I don't select it on my own like I do the Teeth are Not for Biting book.)"
1,Buyer beware!,"I purchased this book in the start of January as I thought it might be great to have on hand when these dubious behaviors (hitting, pushing, biting) come into our lives with our 18 month old. Well, somehow along the way, my child gravitated toward ""hitting mommy"" and it's now a battle we're fighting every day. He loves reading the book and as his love for the book increases, so does his horrible hitting. I can't say it's a direct/exact correlation, but I wouldn't deny that over the past month and a half, we went from zero to frequent hitting. Obviously after making the connection this week through a conversation with another mom in the same situation (same book), it has suddenly disapppeared and will not return to our bookshelf."
3,not great for teaching no biting,decent book. my daughter loves to read it. but there is only one page that talks about biting - nowhere near enough to actually help her learn to stop biting.
5,Quality Filter,"These filters are great. They fit like they were OEM, are blemish free and always work. I always buy Hoya and have never been disappointed."
2,Drawing Flies,"Apparently, flies with cameras mounted on their backs filmed this video. When done filming, they got together and edited their work, adding lots of slow motion. Then they added random shots and white noise in between moments in the interviews.Now, I know some people might not mind the camerawork here, but I think Soundgarden was a highly charismatic band and doesn't need the extra video techniques to create _____. (What were they going for, anyway? Drama? A sense of intoxication? MTV-style '90s sense of immediacy? The hunger and fear of buzzing around a room full of people?) I just wanted to imagine actually being at the show, but I am not a fly.Only the excellent music and a few choice moments of video raise my rating to two; after trying to enjoy Motorvision twice, I am giving up and re-selling this one."
1,Speechless,"Okay so here's the best review you can get: ""This movie is not worth your money."" ... and even if you're seeing it at a friends it's not worth your time. There you have it."
1,Do Not Bother,"I enjoyed the first and second ( Rise Of Taj) Van Wilder movies . They are in my collection. I bought this one thinking it would fall somewhere in between. I purchased the unrated version thinking the Babes would carry the movie if the acting was weak. . WRONG! Ryan Reynolds IS ""Van Wilder"" , Jonathan Bennett is not even close. When the actor playing his prequel father is more beliveable thats bad . If they had made this movie with a diffrent title it might have been watchable fare, hot babes & college pranks. . This Van Wilder movie is more like what you expect after the seventh sequel not the third. Save your brain cells, time and money .Go watch the first two and leave this on the shelves untill they take it back to the studio."
5,Nice picture,"Great products with extreme profissionalism of international shipping. This makes me feel content and wanting to do more business with the amazon family. Concerning the movie itself, I usually buy what I already know I'm gonna get, thanks to the amazing reviewing system of Amazon's and to the often illustrated custumers that buy fine things at Amazon and leave their useful tips. Thank you all!"
2,Disappointed,"Bought this movie because of the ratings. But after beautiful Iranian films, ""Children of heaven"" and ""The Color of Paradise"", ""Baran"" is a so-so."
5,The SOURCE,"You want hits? Then you buy The Source Hip Hop Hits 8, simple as that. The Source has proven year after year to always drop the years best compilation albums. It's got Chingy, Kanye, Lil Jon and TI. I love this cd I listen to it from begining to end. The best song is Kanye West Through the wire."
3,Source 8,"I will do a song by song review of the songs I heard. I have yet to here the one with E-40, Wyclef Jean or Scarface. But here goes my review of the 8th Installment of Source 8.1.Youngbloodz-Damn 9/102.Wyclef Jean-Industry N/A3.Chingy-Right Thurr-7/10 This song is ancient for 044.Young Gunz-Cant stop wont stop-4/105.Westside Connect-Gangsta Nation 10/106.Ja Rule-Clap Back-5/10 like Ja but not this7.Kanye West-Through the Wire-9/108.Gang Starr-9/10 G Mac is wrong about this one great beat.9.J-Kwon-Tipsy-8/10 Massive hit single.10.E-40-Quarterbackin N/A11.Fabolous f Tamia-In to you 10/1012.T.I.-Be Easy 6/1013.Cassidy f R.Kelly-Hotel 7/1014.Ying Yang Twins-Salt Shaker 4/1015.Scarface-Recognize N/A16.The Untouchables-My relationship with my gun-7/10Overall=89/130 are a score in the low 70sNeed these songs on Source 9-99 Problems, Slow Motion, Go DJ, Breathe, Bridging the gap, No Problems, New Lil Jon song, Balla Baby, This Way, Benzino, Kweli, Ghetto Rock and others."
2,Benzino and Ja Rule???,"I thought the title of this CD was ""Hits"" Just because Benzinohas part ownership of the Source magazine, doesn't mean he should be putting his wack tracks on there, or Ja Rule's anti-Emdiss ""Clap Back"". Sorry brahs, but I gotta call 'em like I see 'em. As for the rest? Too much southern rap for my taste, they may make people dance, but there ain't a real MC in the bunch. Where's Luda? Nice to see E-40 and Gang Starr being featured, but that's really all this comp is worth for."
5,Buy it or else....,"Seriously though...I'm gonna make this short and sweet.Every track has been re-recorded....not rehashed...imo these tracks are actually better than the originals. The bonus dvd is pretty cool as well.Randylikee,lol!"
2,Could have been much better.,"As a life long Megadeth fan I was really disappointed with the track listing of the greatest hits CD. Some songs definately belonged but there are scores of examples that I could name that should have been there but were excluded. My conclusion is this: The album was most likely put together by a graph-paper-brained accountant instead of a real music fan. The one song that may have redeemed the whole project (had it been included) was Hook in Mouth from So Far So Good So What. But it too was left out. So don't waste your dough on this one. If you must have it, just borrow it from a friend and burn it."
3,Gotta vent...,"Just a little note for all the Metallica haters. Megadeth, who are a great band and can play like mad, are sell outs more so than Metallica. Metallica has never released a ""greatest hits"" album (S&M was sorta, but it was more of an experiment than a greatest hits). This is Megadeth's second album of this nature. Great songs though."
2,The fans don't,"To compile a greatest hits is a delicate matter, the songs need to fit together as a unit and the best songs not the most popular, notice the distinction. With respect to democracy it's not the way to assemble a GH.I'll be nice and take some of my precious time to present an example of a GH that you can compile at home for free legally granted that you have the original albums and a cd-burner.1. Chosen Ones2. Looking Down The Cross3. The Conjuring4. Devils Island5. Bad Omen6. Mary Jane7. 5028. Five Magics9. Poison Was The Cure10. Tornado Of Souls11. Skin O' My Teeth12. High Speed Dirt13. Ashes In Your Mouth14. Elysian Fields15. The Killing Road16. Trust17. She-WolfI'd want to have songs from later albums on the GH but can't find a song that qualifies. Remember only the best songs fit on a GH.I hope that this review was helpful and that you click on the 'yes' button below. Thanks."
5,UNBELIEVEABLE.. A MUST HAVE,"Patti Labelle, the Stylistics, Maxine Nightingale, Heatwave, on and on and on. All the classics from the 70s. But redone today. Its nothing less than spectacular & incredible. A PBS fundraiser and something that will make your CD collection complete! REMARKABLE. Music that integrates ALL people regardless of race, gender, age. THIS IS A MUST HAVE CD!"
4,5 Stars for Jimmy; 3 for Speedy,"Beautiful work by Jimmy Bryant, but too often Speedy West treats the pedal steel as a novelty instrument. Enough with the cartoon sound effects."
3,Strarosphere Boogie,"While Jimmy Bryant is an exceptional guitarist, those people expecting an equal on the steel guitar will be disappointed. Speedy West is no Tom Morrel, much less a Buddy Emmons."
3,WWII Germany 1944-45,"Max Hastings ARMAGEDDON is a telling of the last year of WWII in Europe with a special emphasis upon the German nation and army. Although intersting and informative, the book is at lease 1/3 too long. It is also evident that Hastings regards the German army by far as the elite fighting unit of the war. The Americans and British lack imagination, and the Russians discipline, something he believes the Germans had in full."
4,Excellent Perspective on History,"Max Hastings ""Armageddon"" is an excellent view of the management of the last year of WW II by all of the principle participants. The perspective offered by Hastings is an interesting departure from the white washed view that is frequently presented by WW II films and documentaries.Hastings opens some interesting discussions on the political atmosphere between the allies. He is especially candid in his accounts of the Churchill--Roosevelt relationship. He misses an opportunity to explore the role of the French and their ego-driven self image versus their actual (rather meager) contribution to the war effort. Perhaps the fact that the French were passed over in Hastings account of the management of the war is statement enough on their contribution.James P. Hoban"
4,Very interesting history of the final year of World War II in Europe,"If you are interested in the history of World War II, you will definitely like this book. More generally, it's also a good case study of man's inhumanity to man and the book does a good job of illustrating how civilians and non-combatants (focusing on the Germans in 1944-1945 in this case) inevitably end up suffering when they get caught in a war zone. Atrocities were committed on all sides, but this book describes how the Russians in particular were seething for retribution after years of unimaginable casualties both on and off the battlefield and looked at the invasion of Germany in 1945 as payback time. As a result, German soldiers and civilians alike paid a terrible price in areas conquered by the Red Army during the drive to Berlin."
4,Great contents but poor paperback,"Max Hastings has performed a true tour-de-force, combining first-hand accounts, grand strategy, small-unit actions, critical assessment of opposing armies and leaders, the plight of the civilians, in a long but not at all tedious volume.The paperback binding however has one of the worst qualities I have ever seen. The book has broken down into pieces and bunches of pages while the cover has almost completely fallen off. This is the reason why it wont get a 5-star rating. This is a pity for such a quality work. I will actually buy the Critica spanish translation which comes in a great hard cover and has outstanding translation."
