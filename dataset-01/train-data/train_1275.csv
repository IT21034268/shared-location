2,Great three-quarter read then abandons plot,"I really liked this book for about three-quarters of it, then it abandoned the plot and suspense and got all preachy and nihilistic, ""Oh what a horrible place the world is."" and ""We are all awful hopeless people in a hopeless world."" Save me the sermon. GIVE ME A RESOLUTION TO YOUR STORY!!! Love the Coen Brothers but won't see this flawed ""story"" in film form."
3,Good Beginning and Middle...,"The book is an easy read and takes an unusual twist or two, but the last fifth of the book was not satisfying. It is almost as if McCarthy didn't know how to end it. Perhaps a better book in the ""violent cultural melt-down"" genre would be found in Coetzee's novels. If No Country For Old Men were done by Hollywood, they would certainly need to change the ending."
2,Alas...,"The long hiatus between Cities of the Plain and No Country for Old Men wasn't very fruitful. I've been a McCarthy fan for 15 years, and this last effort is very, very disapointing. Yes the prose is McCarthy, but the storyline has lost a lot to cheap expedience and a huge and unnecessary pile of bloody corpses. What saddens me the most is that the feeling of elation is gone. What a waste."
5,Skip The Road and read No Country for Old Men,"I would love to see more westerns set in modern times like this. This book is seat in 1980 on the Texas Mexico border and the wars involving the drug cartels are just starting to heat up. I could not put this book down for two seconds, unlike The Road which I read after No Country for Old Men and was disappointed. I say skip The Road and read No Country for Old Men.I love how McCarthy breaks the all of the rules with No Country for Old Men. He would drive an English teacher crazy and the traditional plot goes to the wayside as well. This book demonstrates how the bad guy sometimes gets away and the main character does not always ride off into the sunset. The Coen Brothers also did a great job making this book into a movie. If you read the book and see the movie you will be pleased to find that Hollywood stayed true to the book. It's like McCarthy's character stepped directly out of the book and onto the silver screen."
4,iPhone Version Far Far Better Than Expected,"Having finished The Road while on vacation in Mexico, I was desperate for more Cormac McCarthy. I walked half a mile to the little Tiendita at the GringoLandia resort where we were renting a condo. My iPhone wireless connection wasn't great, but wasn't horrible either. After I'd downloaded the iPhone Kindle Reader App, I downloaded No Country for Old Men. The App worked flawlessly and reading on my iPhone proved to be very easy. Within minutes I'd forgotten what device I was using to read and just read the book... quickly and effortlessly. Whether in hardback, paperback, or electronic version, No Country for Old Men is a great read. Now, come on Amazon, please make the Cowboy Trilogy available for Kindle.No Country for Old Men (Vintage International)"
3,"Fast paced, riveting, violent","Once started it's hard to put this book down. It is fast paced with a riveting story line. The language is simple and boiled down to the basics. There are no flowery descriptions of peoples feelings or dramatic landscapes. Given that most scenes carry a fair amount of blood, this is a good thing. Characters aren't very deep or well developed, or maybe they just don't live long enough to get developed. It's a perfect story for a Coen brothers movie.One more thing...is it really that hard to put quotes around the dialog?"
5,The Human Condition,"No Country for Old Men is a sad tale about the human condition. We are beings who are haunted by our past, afraid of our present and have no confidence in our future. This book like all of Cormac McCarthy's work leaves you wondering how humans have become so cruel and empty. Those capable of love are destroyed by the evil that runs rampant.McCarthy's writing style is direct and unashamed of its brutal honesty. He makes no effort to make good from evil. He tells the story as succinctly as possible. His words are never wasted. Every word is important and is chosen for a reason. It is a rare gift."
3,Ok. But I was expecting more.....,"I decided to read this book after seeing the movie. I was so intrigued with the characters that I wanted to learn more about them figuring the author would have delved deeper into them. But there really wasn't much more there. This was one of those rare instances where I felt the movie was better than the book.This was the first Cormac McCarthy book I've read. I loved the story and I loved the characters and I appreciated the regional aspects of the writing, but I couldn't help but feel I was reading John Grisham's version of Bridges of Madison County."
5,A Very Good Read,"My humble advice is to disregard the 1-star reviews, read the book, and come to your own conclusions about this book. It seems that the 1-star reviews are plagued by complaints of ""This book doesn't end the way I wanted it to..."", ""This books does not follow commonly accepted rules of punctuation..."", and other banal comments that simply indicate to me that the book is beyond the reading ability of the reviewers. In an age of repetitive novel plots and universal happy endings, it is refreshing to see a truly original plot and a storyline that is at once believable and yet surreal. This is a ""big boy & girl book"", perhaps the 1-star reviewers should stick to pop-up books, mass market crime trash, and Disney movie biographs."
2,No Country for Old Men,"Well written with some good dialogue, but overall the plot didn't make much sense. Some was just unbelievable, with the bad guy always able to find the good guy, even without a transponder. The conclusion gave the impression that the author didn't really know how to end it, so just cut it off."
2,Maybe I just didn't get it....,"Maybe I just didn't get the whole point of the book, but this really should have been about 60 pages shorter than it was. What seems to be the main storyline abruptly ends with a significant portion of the book left to go. Cormac McCarthy's writing style is almost too painful to read. With no regard for traditional grammar and punctuation, what little dialog exists is nearly impossible to negotiate."
2,starts with a bang ends with a whimper,I'm not sure if I have ever read a book that had such an amazing start and that then became so bad. It went from 4 stars to 2. One of the main problems is that about three-fourths of the way through the novel there was a major turning point and from that point on the novel was so boring that I almost quit reading it. Perhaps McCarthy was trying to do something unique with the non-traditional story structure but it didn't work for me. I felt like the story was done 100 pages before it actually ended. I'm surprised to hear myself saying this but skip the book and see the movie instead.
2,Say It Ain't So,"Read the first 225 pages. Then stop and sell the book. If readers have rights, ours have been violated."
1,NO Country for old men,I found this book to be rather silly. The whole story could have been done in one chapter. I would not recommend it to anyone. I threw it away.
2,Doing a spellcheck is not editing,"I couldn't believe this guy. He couldn't be bothered putting in quotations which just makes it harder. Also, he only used apostrophes for words like she's and he's, words which the spellcheck picked up on, words like can't and won't were left as cant and wont.Very sloppy, but because he's got a reputation he can get away with it."
1,I didn't make it past the first few chapters,"No quotations or punctuation. Sentences with no structure seem to run together. I found myself reading pagagraphs over and over again to figure out who said what or to whom the author was referring in any particular ""scene.""One such example:[quote]Just walked in the door. Sheriff he had some sort of thing on him like one of them oxygen tanks for emphysema or whatever. Then he had a hose that run down the inside of his sleeve and went to one of those stunguns like they use at a slaughterhouse. Yessir. Well that's what it looks like. You can can see it when you get in. Yessir. I got it covered. Yessir.When he stood up out of the chair he swung the keys off his belt ... [/quote]Uh ... is this the narrator speaking or the person in the scene or ... ?High school students write better than this."
2,Tedious,"I had to read this for my college Modern Fiction class, followed by the movie. I found this book to be tedious and boring, same goes for the movie. What's up with that ending? Other than that, I don't know what else to say, since I really didn't like it."
1,One Star Country,I am an old man. Lived in Texas for 24 years. Too bad the lowest rating is one star ... this book deserves less.
1,Hated the movie...only to be assigned the book,"I honestly thought it was just the movie that was bad, maybe it was directing, editing, or the over acting, but when assigned to read the book for an English class I realized the whole thing was a disaster. Like the movie the book is chaotic. MAYBE and that is a BIG MAYBE I would have like the book a bit if I had not watched the movie. Don't get me wrong it's a good story, but reading and watching it, it's very unorganized... just ALL OVER THE PLACE."
1,"no plot, no finish","This author writes scenes very well, and creates expectations that he cannot or will not fulfill. He has no plot, and no ending. The intrusive narrator who interrupts the action from time to time never has any contact with the other main characters. It's not explained what happens to the two main characters, and the villain of the piece just floats away. Very disappointing and makes you wonder what the author might do if he learned to plot."
1,The movie is much better,I can't believe how much I hate this book. I LOVED the movie. This book is intolerable though. I didn't make it far at all because it bored me out of my mind. The characters repeat themselves and each other so much it's insane. Just watch the movie it's great!!
3,"Interesting yarn, nothng more.","This is my first McCarthy book. A good two day read. Decent story with some interesting twists. But what it has to tell us about fate and chance and good and evil and wrong choices and paths that cross (or dont) and staying close to the people who love you, we already knew that. At least I did."
2,So-So,Definitely not up to McCarthy standards. This book is confusing. Not realistic at all. I skipped the last 25% because it was so unbelievable and impossibly unreal.
3,Don't Bother!,"Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer traditional writing. The way the book was written made it a terribly tedious read for me. Other than that the story was good but the end left me hanging. I will never again read another book by Mr. McCarthy. I tried to change my star rating from three to two, but was unable to do so in the ""Edit Review"" page."
5,One of the best,The novel is a mix of thriller and intellectual powers. Sheriff's dialogues are worth reading and they bind the reader with the book till the end. The suspense thriller makes you read this book at a stetch. The book deals with the social ethics and the response to it.
5,The movie gets too much credit!,"Let me say that I love the movie version of the novel. Incredible acting, pacing and storytelling. But now that I have read the book, I think the Coen brothers receive a tad too much credit -- almost everything special in the movie is here in the book. The Coens, of course, did a fantastic job in translating this amazing novel (which is a huge skill in itself), but the great dialog is all here. Normally, I don't like to read a book after having seen the movie, but this book is so good that they only enhanced each other."
3,Just couldn't get into it,"The story and characters in this novel were compelling, but the writing ruined it for me. I read this book for a literature course I was taking, and the main complaint from everyone was how the book was written. No quotations and a seeming lack of structure just made this hard to get through. With so much focus on just understanding the writing, the story lost its appeal for me."
4,"Big fan of McCarthy, not my #1 pick","I am a big fan of Cormac McCarthy and believe he's one of the finest living writers of our time. I enjoyed the book, but was not ""blown away"" as I normally am by his writing. If you enjoyed the movie or are a huge McCarthy fan, I encourage you to buy the book. Still giving it 4 stars, but not a big 5+."
5,Great!!,"Great book. The story is gripping and exciting. It combines perfectly some action and reflections about the human nature about violence, human relationships and greed. I couldn't put it down. You coundn't stop reading until finished."
4,A Great Read,"This is a special book on numerous levels. It is a Western that is set in modern times with a great deal of morality infused into it. The plot, itself, is not a complex one, yet it becomes a classic in the hand of the writer. Each chapter begins with musings by the Sheriff about the world, his life and how things have evolved with the passage of time. This gives the reader great insight into the character as well as the motivations for his actions. The characters are all richly developed in this superb work that almost reads like a moralty play. It is a deeply satisfying book by a superb writer. It does not fit into the category of being a page-turner, yet is a very special read that is far superior to the film that was based upon this work."
2,Another story based on Moral Relavance,"I read this book as part of my reading list on a vacation to Germany and Italy. After seeing the trailer for upcoming movie, I was intriqued enough to read this book. I was disappointed.The reviewer from Publishers Weekly sees the novel as coming to grips with a new type of criminal. Sorry, but those type of deviants have been with us since the dawn of recorded history. What the novel is about is moral relavancy - every character in this book has a flaw which the author uses to state that there are no heroes. The good guys all have flaws that more or less makes them impotent against evil. The ""good guy"" - Sheriff Bell - loses in the end and the evil sociopath succeeds.Sorry, but I just cannot recommend this book to anyone."
3,Who stole Cormac?,"This book: 3 parts the movie 'Terminator II', 1 part the movie 'Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia'. This coming from the maestro who brought us books of such uncompromising intensity as Suttree and Blood Meridian - one is left after reading those masterworks with thoughts that this modern world has seen to it that a great author will not come along again. Unfortunately Cormac, in his twilight years, has released this - really nothing more than a screenplay, with some core characters removed from the drugworld that supposedly would make them real. Cormac has previously set the bar so high that 'No Country for Old Men' is mediocre fair. It might make a decent movie, and none of the breathless descriptive passages for which we come to Cormac will be missed for there are none here."
1,the book and video,"I purchased both the book and the video..The movie was confused, or at least it confused me, so I bought the book to try to unscramble the content of the movie..disappointing..Tommy Lee Jones who plays the Sheriff in the movie was the most interesting character but even with his skills in acting, he was hard pressed to present a believable character.I suppose I am too old to appreciate all the chaotic word pictures and the sad presentation of both movie and book. I don't understand why or how the movie captured the acadamy awards......not satisfying as a book or movie..sorry about that.......... I appreciate a story line that has a beginning, a middle, and an ending..kind of ties things together and leaves the viewer or reader with the feeling of a good read, or view, and happy...the book and the movie did neither for me."
1,What's the point?,"Very little plot, which is boring.The reader should be paid by the page, if not by the word, to read this book!"
2,Michiko Kakutani is right (as always),"Even though he hasn't published a book in seven years, Cormac McCarthy himself said this novel took him six months to write. It shows. The book is way thin. Maybe it started as one of his screenplays. Anyone who's read The Stonemason knows that McCarthy should not write plays or screenplays. Like Don DeLillo, he's not good at it. This book is McCarthy's Vineland. Hopefully his next novel won't be as lame as Mason & Dixon.P.S. Please nominate Judge Holden to the Supreme Court. Thanx."
2,Not impressed,"I think the book is quite overrated. I didn't like any of the characters and the plot just seemed very forced. I read the book when I heard about the movie coming out - but to be honest, I didn't like the movie that much either once I saw it. It just didn't live up to the hype. I actually read and preferred The Road much much more..."
2,This is literature?,"About twenty pages into this book I began to laugh. I'm still laughing, hence the two stars. The bad guy in this is so nasty-nasty-nasty, while most of his victims are inertly passive, that the tale rapidly degenerates to farce, and not very good farce at that.It is as if Freddie had wandered off the Friday 13th set and into a Louis L'Amour shoot-em-up.And for the record: slangy Texas cliches do not interesting dialogue make."
1,Not Good.,"I LOVE McCarthy's older work, but this book just feels like crummy popular lit - checkout stand quality. Pretty surprising considering the depth of some of his previous novels - like ""The Orchard Keeper"" or ""Blood Meridian."" It feels like McCarthy whipped out this book with no real thought to crafting serious, nuanced prose or characters with any sort of real complexity. I'm surprised to see this kind of quality from one of my favorite writers. I'm sure the money from the movie rights is good - but if you have to write this kind of junk to appeal to Hollywood, it's a shame. This book feels like a sellout. Here's hoping McCarthy gets back to some serious writing soon - he's like no one else when he's really on."
4,Awesome work,This is one wonderful bookk from Cormac McCarthy. I was hooked up to it from page one. Great work Cormac. Keep it up!
2,Ugh,"We wait seven years for a book, and by the author's own admission this is the labor of six months. As Christopher Ricks says, ""Great artists take great risks"" and Cormac used to do so - no longer. In his twilight years, one might expect some new-fangled creation honoring, say, a Dostoevsky, one of Cormac's shining stars, and instead we get a throw-away ""thriller"" to the cannon. Unconvincing characters detached from the drug-world that is supposedly making them real. And the driving force to great Cormac writing - description - is missing. Moral to the novel: tell your children not to make fun of kids named 'Sugar'. Now don't forget."
3,Deeply Underwhelming,"There's so much you want to like here--the story moves briskly, the characters are vivid, the atmosphere crisp and tangible--that the flaws in ""No Country for Old Men"" are that much more painful and annoying. McCarthy beats you to death with West Texas patois and folk mumbles, uh, wisdom. He's got so much macho pain, death, revenge, FOREBEARANCE, and careful politeness to women going, this reads like a Texan Ranger training manual. Then there's this Hemingway thing. No adjectives. Short sentences. And finally, some sort of curmedugeon rumblings about things just gettin'out-of-control. And so many, many rumblings. You really feel like you're fighting against the current working your way to the of this story. And then, it just ends with all the loose ends flying. I don't know."
3,Blasphemy - the movie is better than the book!,"No Country for Old Men was fascinating storytelling, but not easy to read. It was riveting, stark, violent, and very suspenseful. The author created unusual characters - Bell, Moss, and Chigurh. Bell and Moss both were offered with different levels of character flaws, and both were likable in their own ways. Chigurh was a machine with only slight glimpses of humanity, very well drawn. The drawback of the book is that Cormac McCarthy didn't use quotation marks around the dialog, a literary device that drives me crazy when trying to read. After finishing it, I watched the movie. While I could answer questions that my companion had about the story that wasn't explained well, I liked the screen version better. Perhaps though, reading the book first is the way to better enjoy the movie. This book is recommended, especially to fans of Cormac McCarthy."
4,5 stars until McCarthy hits the brakes,"So the book's title is ""No Country for Old Men"", but McCarthy doesn't decide to hammer that concept in until the last 60 pages or so. Before that is one of the most violent and exciting noir stories that I have ever read. It's as if he said hmm I've written this beach novel, and now I've got to make it literary. I like his literary, but he does damned good beach novel as well. I'll tell you this. I've never read anything quite like this book. The way the exciting part ends and the lecture about how the country has gone to ka-ka takes over is weird. I sure will be interested to see how the Coen's handle filming the subject. My guess is they'll embellish the noir and downplay Sheriff Bell's philosophizing, and it'll be one of those rare cases of the movie being better than the book."
5,Possibly better on tape?,"I didn't actually read the book, but listened to a book on tape version. It could be that the different voices helped me understand it better. I tried to read another of McCarthy's books, Blood Meridian, and found the lack of punctuation marks too distracting to read. However, when I listened to this, I found that the story was excellent and captivating. Apparently, there are flaws in the story, but I was too wrapped up in what was happening in the story to know or care. The sheriff's last monologue is boring compared to the rest of the story, but explains a great deal about the title of the book and perhaps the opinion of McCarthy himself."
3,"Good, Easy to Read and Entertaining!","After seeing the movie, I read the book. I didn't like the ending of the movie and hoped the book would be better. The book is very easy to read and it is not a long book. The author uses an odd writing style by never using quotation marks which makes it sometimes confusing when reading the dialogue. It's amazing how the movie is almost verbatim what is in the majority of the book including all of the dialogue! That's so unusual! It's a fun read and I'm sure many will disagree with me when I say that I don't think that this is a great book. I think the endings in the book and movie could have been a lot better. Sure, you can read a lot of things into the meaning of the ending, but I think that at the end of both the movie and book I was disappointed and thinking ""that was it?""."
1,Horrible Book,"Old Cormac seems to think he doesn't need to conform to the way stories are normally told... this is such a horrible book, it makes my eyes cross... the storyline is tedious and the ending leaves you just angry that you wasted some of your time on earth with this piece of trash.The storyline breaks away from the main character to follow the ramblings of an old man that could have been wrapped up with the phrase ""kids these days!"" He does everything but complain about the music of these young kids.Horrible story... just a mess."
1,"So frustrating, I couldn't finish it.","I puchased this book on recommendation and hype and I can honestly say I just don't get it. The story lacks direction, the characters are boring and the grammar is horrendous. The lack of proper punctuation and apparent intentional use of massive quantities of run-on sentences is maddening at best. I am sure I must be missing something here, but I just can't bring myself to finish it. Makes a great coaster, though."
1,Unreadable,"This is the second book by Cormac McCarthy I have read, and I am very disappointed and confused on why so many people like his books. I struggled to get through this book. I felt the plot was good, but the way he writes it is so boring, that it is unreadable. Just never brought me in like so many good authors do."
1,Very poorly written,"I don't care how popular this author is; this is the most poorly written book I ever read.The first paragraph is historically wrong. Texas doesn't gas death row inmates and never has. It went downhill from there for me.No one living in the Sanderson area would hike or hunt without plenty of drinking water like the man in this book....oh heck, it's all crap so why go on.This book was recommended to me by someone who obviously enjoys very shallow story lines and characters."
1,Never understood the hype,"Like the title says, I'll never understand this book's popularity. The overly-descriptive writing, the switching back and forth between the sheriff's essays and the story, the real lack of an understanding of the plot; it just didn't flow for me at all. Luckily, it was a fairly quick read."
2,Not Very Interesting,"This book has a good theme behind it, but is tedious to enter and does not sustain enough interest to pursue"
3,Bitter old man,"Am I the only one who detects a bitter old man who conjures up the perfect villain to explain his pain?I love Mccarthy's story telling -- I love the language. But in the end, I wound up feeling like his gifts have been sacrificed to the red/blue political shift in this country, and he's on the other side from me, so I wound up feeling preached to be a bitter old right-wing nut.But one hell of a great story-telling bitter old right-wing nut."
2,No time for hopelessness,"For years, Cormac McCarthy has been one of my favorite writers. His novels always seemed to establish a perfect balance of hope and dignity in the face of total despair. Even Blood Meridian offered some shred of humanity in a landscape nearly devoid of moral value.No Country for Old Men offers characters with plenty of dignity, but this time there is a total absence of hope. McCarthy's Sheriff Bell has it figured that the world is going straight to hell and that his generation was the last one worth a damn. This message gets old pretty quick.As a father of two young children in an extremely confusing world, I have to have hope that the future holds a better place for them. If the ""sage"" ruminations provided by Sheriff Bell are what McCarthy has to offer, I think I'm done with McCarthy."
4,Strange Ending,"90%of this book was extraordinary but the last part and the ending was absurd and impossible to follow in the context of the story. Along the way some of the characters seemed out of place and the violence gratutious but I felt the author provided tremendous ""feel"" for the West Texas environment and culture and the dialog for the most part was fascinating.Were it not for the implausible ending I would have given this five stars."
4,A great easy read,"No Country For Old Men is a real easy read. The action is relentless, and the bad guy is pretty much up there with Shawrzennegger's Terminator for his relentless pursuit of the hero.Once you get used to Cormac McCarthy's style of writing (no punctuation marks and excessively long passages in italics) then this is a real treat that fully deserved its foray in to the film world courtesy of the Coen Brothers. It's only a shame the book isn't a little bit longer."
5,"Hey Genius, yeah you Richard L. Pangburn.....","Ever heard of A SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!! Yes, thank you for your intellectual insight on the Book of Revelations and room 117. Your a freakin' genius! Try putting a warning on there next time!!!"
3,Not up to his usual excellent standards,"Completely forgetable, basically just a potboiler: 'Texas Prey'."
3,Blood Sport,"This is the bloodiest novel by Cormac McCarthy since, well, ""Blood Meridian."" This novel is definitely not for the squeamish. Mr. McCarthy provides an everflowing river of blood, graphic deaths, and characters with worthless lives, who make a series of bad decisions. Their ending is predictable and fated: horrifying death.The setting is familiar to fans of Mr. McCarthy: the hill country of West Texas. Why he chose to create this pulp fiction, when he created the sublime Border Trilogy is a mystery. As a loyal reader, who has read all of Mr. McCarthy's novels, one can only hope his gift of genius will emerge again. No, Cormac McCarthy is not William Faulkner. For this one novel, more like Jim Thompson.Please come back Mr. McCarthy."
1,Way below his talent,"Here is Cormac writing a deposit slip instead of a novel. It is fast moving, well-paced, bogging down here and there when he gets inside the sheriffs head, but nothing like his earlier great books. The absurd cattle-gun which even Jeffrey Dahmer would think was ridiculous, is clearly a set piece for violence for its own sake. Cormac saw the returns for his tepid Pretty Horses and went for the gold. He can't be blamed for his greed as a human being; but as a potential literary immortal, he has embarrassed himself and his craft. He should have written this pot-boiler under another name--it might have helped if the secret was kept. This book also sheds a bad light on his prior books where violence has often been cited as gratuitous. It seems those criticisms were correct and we simply have a great craftsman, not a great author, venting in endless repulsive fashion his inner demons like dirty laundry on a long line."
5,A violent but moving story,"This book was a bit difficult to read at first because of the ""stream of conciousness"" ramblings of the main character, but once I adapted I found it an intriguing story. A decent guy finds a load of cash and a lot of dead bodies from a drug deal gone bad. He takes the cash then finds he is running from one of the most lethal and sadistic killers in modern fiction. The local sheriff tries to help but he seems to be dealing with his own demons. The action takes place all around the southwest and comes to a violent and climatic end, an ending which may befuddle some readers.This story is about decent people caught up in a deadly situation and a good man trying to reconcile his past. There is lots of action and the story moves along at an unbeleivable pace. Highly recommended."
2,A Misfire From a Great Author,"With this book, Cormac McCarthy apparently tried his hand at writing an Elmore Leonard novel. Lean, propulsive writing...quirky characters...large sections of dialog-driven narrative...explosive violence...even a tangled, unsatisfying conclusion. Without the leavening of Leonard's comic black humor, however, the result is a portentous mess. I second the comments of other Amazon reviewers who noted that after a masterful beginning, the story veers into a cul-de-sac somewhere after the half-way point and ends with an extended meditation on the least interesting character in the novel.I am a big Cormac McCarthy fan, and will continue to read his new books as they appear, but the wheels flew off the cart this time. If you haven't read any McCarthy and were thinking about starting with NCFOM, check out the Border Trilogy instead."
3,Dull Country for All Men,"While I do agree that the writing is strong I found this book to be borderline fluff. Characters are introduced and eliminated for no apparent reason or explanation (I am still not even sure who the main character is). There is no real plot here nor is there a climax. Everything is just very random. Key parts of the action are completely skipped and then spoken about by the characters later on... similar to a low budget movie that does not want to spend the money on the expensive scenes.If there is a lot of deeper meaning and symbolism it was lost on me. I feel like you need to truly engross a reader to get that point across. Here I was just thinking ""who cares?"" the whole time."
3,nothing special,"Well written, but good writing can't make up for too many coincidences and poor conclusion."
2,Meandering & Tiresome Story,"I was unimpressed by this book. I didn't think it delivered a meaningful plot or significant character development. The story in fact seems truncated. Each time the writer begins to allow for interesting connections to characters they end with the death of the character or a change of scene. The antagonist of the story is more robotic than human. He resembles the terminator (1st one) in his relentless killing and stamina. He lacks personality, history or apparent purpose.Each part of the book begins with a soliloquy by the Sheriff that are not revelatory or profound. The final chapters of the book are told by the Sheriff and include his musings on the old times v. modernity. These lack insight and connection to the plot, as well as anything to intrigue readers.The ending and the way the book deals with the antoganist and other characters is unsatisfying. The book seems like a half-hearted attempt and left me scratching my head at the point of it all."
2,a Trevanian potboiler without the razor,"If you enjoy the fetishization of firearms, the eroticization of violence, and the cheezification of Faulknerian language, this novel is for you. It's Trevanian and Alistair MacLean with lots of italicized homespun wisdom. Macarthy's reputation is puzzling: his dialogue is hokey, his prose is impoverished American modernism (like Faulkner he likes to skip the apostrophe in contractions; like Joyce he eschews quotation marks), his characterizations are utterly uninteresting from a psychological perspective. This is not to say that he does not construct readable books. I gulped this one down right quick. But it's tripe."
3,less than his best,"Guess who got Mccarthy's vote for President. This is your basic family values credo gussied up with the author's fabled style and command, one cut above a glossy, embossed cover, airport, pass the time on the flight (and not a long one) paperback.If you want Mccarthy in full flower, read BLOOD MERIDIAN.I hope he did this for the money."
4,"Skilled, mesmerizing writing...",is enough reason to read this fine thriller. A rumination on the evil that exists and those sworn to protect us. A very good book.
4,No Book for Feeble Constitutions,"Classic Mccarthy characters in a slightly different and more modern day genre. One of the fastest reads ever - the pace is like that of an action thriller, and I thought I was watching a movie rather than reading a book. Artistic writing but not as stylistic as the Border Trilogy, which were 5 stars to me."
4,Good book if a little preachy,"This is a great book for about 3/4 of the way. Late in the book, it gets a little long-winded and preachy. You can only stomach just so much homespun philosophy before you yak. But the first 3/4 of the book is worth it. Classic McCarthy. Violent but compelling. The end is sort of a let-down but I think it was still a great book."
3,usefull,As a therapist I was interested in the book as a tool to be used in treatment of individuals sufferring from depression. I can see how some clients would benefit from this book. I intended to use the information in this book as a form of continuing education by logging on to the [...] website. I think it will qualify I suggest this book for other clinicians looking for a good book to provide clients.
3,The DVD is Region 2,"The DVD cannot be played in the US for Region 1. Initially, I was planning on returning it, then I bought a DVD player that will play and convert PAL (Region 2) to NTSC TV (Region 1). I love the movie too much to return it."
3,"Nice, not amazing.","The product is very nice. At first I was overwhelmed by the scent, but once it is applied, it's not as heavy. This oil isn't as luxe as the petrol based products I'm used to, but I'm willing to give that up to not be slathering myself with petrol! I was able to find similar lower priced products at my local natural foods store, so i will probably try them next."
4,Good cam,"This is a good cam considering the price paid ($99)It does the job well however at times the image changes into an infrared like image.I am not able to access it from outside the network, but that may be my problem...."
3,Not to sure yet...,"I'm not to sure yet, I have not purchased the book only b/c I just think when you want to take food advise from someone, they should be the ones that dont need to lose weight too. According to the picture, it looks like she is overweight, not exactly obease, but hey can you blame me for being skeptical? I may just try anyway, maybe its a trick of the photograph... I dont know. We shall see."
1,Tired and Dated,"Like most of Re/Search's output, this is largely interviews with a bunch of attention hungry self-promoters that has not dated terribly well because most of the subjects were simply not that interesting. The only appeal this work retains is the unintentional humor of so many people taking their hobby so seriously because it was so ""underground"": now that you can buy ""body modification"": magazines at Safeway and Ralph's, the ""cutting-edge"" cachet is missing and what's left? Nothing much."
5,"Powerful, Emotional",Sinead takes you to the day all of these things happened to her. With her voice you feel her pain and sorrow... cheers
5,"Angry ,Powerful ,Elagant ,Amazing","Angry and Awsome! This album shows Sinead in her true colours,it contains a wide rang of differnt styles of music.From thepowerfull track ""Fire On Babylon"" the angry ""Red Football"" the cover of Nivanas ""All Apologies"".You will not be disapointed with this album.Some of the more tame tracks include ""Thank You For Hearing Me"" and the elagant ""John I Love You"".Sinead dedicated this album as a prayer from Ireland ,? I have no clue why? Unfortunitley this album did not send her back to superstardom after the prvious album (The one I dislike and think is her worst) ""Am I Not Your Girl"" a collection of big band covers.But this one definitly is her finest to date ,Faith And Courage following very close behind.You will like this album if you like ""Tori Amos"" ""Alanis Morrisset"" ""Liz Phair"" ""Kate Bush"" and ""Beth Hart"". My opinion on this album ""IT ROCKS!""!"
3,It has Universal appeal.,"I admit I didn't get this until last year, but am glad I have it now. I won't say it's as excellent as ""I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got"" or ""Faith And Courage"", but it's up there. ""Fire On Babylon"" is very strong, and ""John, I Love You"" is very good also. Many of the songs are fairly soft and quiet, though she excells at those as well. ""All Apologies"" is even more gentle than the Nirvana original, and ""Scorn Not His Simplicity"" is mellow and moving too. As with all her albums, as wonderful as the music is, it's still her voice that takes center stage. She truly can belt it out better than most. Overall I may send a newcomer elsewhere, but any real fan should own ""Universal Mother""."
4,Sweet Voice,"Sinead O'Connor has the best female voice in rock in the '90's, if not all time. This is a very, very good album. The best songs are Scorn Not His Simplicity and A Perfect Indian. The lyrics are pure poetry. The classical piano is magnificent, and provides the perfect backdrop for her magical voice. The same can go for All Babies and In This Heart. And I really like her version of All Apologies. These songs make up the core of the album.Fire in Babylon, Thank You For Hearing Me, and John, I Love You are solid Sinead songs. The rest are ok. I can do without Red Football and Famine. These, while intersting, tend to be on the ""rant"" side.What I like about this album overall, is the sweetness about it. It's female, motherly, soft, sweet and warm in general. This tends to contrast sharply with Sinead's public persona, which is why you should always separate the person from the music."
2,Last on your list,"If you're a Sinead O'Connor fan and would like to own all of her albums, put this last on your list. There are only 2 or 3 songs which are typical of the fiery singer."
1,there's good reason why 162 people sell this CD for a penny,"This garbage, along with ""Am I not your girl"" - are why I'm no longer an S O'Connor fan.Glad I bought in on BMG new for only $2. - It simply sucks."
2,"Go back to your former sound, wherever it went...","When this CD opens with ""Fire on Babylon"", you think she has returned. You feel like you could be in for something. Sure, the ""Germaine"" thing is a little wierd, but when ""Fire.."" plays, you feel like the CD is back on track. Sadly, that's not the case. The CD goes completely downhill after that great song. All of the rest are either boring(All Apologies, Scorn not his Simplicity, Tiny Grief Song, Thank You for hearing me) uninteresting(All Babies, In This Heart, John I Love You, My Darling Child) or just plain wierd (Red Football, Am I a Human, Famine). Ok, I take one thing back. ""In This Heart"" is a good song But it can't save ""Red Football"" or ""Famine"". Sinead, go back to the sound that made you popular."
3,OK for reincarnation research,"Probably a book ahead of its time, but there are so many other books dealing with this now. I thought the book was a bit slow reading, but enjoy as it does have a story to tell."
4,Brothers At War,Interesting movie that many would enjoy. It was in reasonably good shape with only a couple of skips. My husband was satisfied with it.
1,Sucked! Sucked!,This book so totally sucked! I will never read anythink else from any of thse authurs again.
1,Piece of junk... avoid,"Bought this little addition to my Creative Zen micro to protect it and carry it around as I use my MP3 everywhere I can. Started by scratching the little screen, but I could still live with that. Unfortunately there is a major design flaw in this system with the screw getting loose very quickly. My MP3 ended up on the concrete of the parking lot. No need to say that it is dead!So if you want to keep your Zen micro in good shape, avoid this at all cost."
1,BAD PRODUCT! STAY AWAY!,"I don't know who wrote good reviews about this product. Do they work for the seller?This hard case put a giant gash on the front screen, and several hairlines on the back of my precious Zen Micro, upon first insertion!Who is the genius who thought it was safe to put HARD CLEAR PLASTIC against HARD CLEAR PLASTIC? Save yourself the agony and get another case from Creative.The spring broke on my manufacturer's case's clip, which is why I wanted to buy a new case. I admit, I'm an idiot for paying $19 for this. But I can't believe it's selling online for $39 some places! It's not even worth having for free, since it damages your player.When I heard they wouldn't refund me, I ran it over with my Jeep. This was the most fulfilling part of my shopping experience."
2,Overrated,"Not very sexy, or interesting, and it seemed a bit dishonest all the way through, rather like a romp written to make money while claiming some depth."
1,False hope,"I borrowed a copy of STRIP CITY by Lily Burana hoping for funny, sexy or at least interesting stories about the world of stripping. Instead, I repeatedly started and then skipped ahead from one section to the next, finding the author's wordy style boring. Finally, realizing my hopes were false, I returned STRIP CITY without having finished it. Were Burana not a hot-looking woman with a salivating past, I wonder if an editor (male editor, anyway) would have published this book.Another false hope: at least a few STRIP CITY pictures? Except for the head shot in the dustcover, there are zero photographs. How can a book about a stripper not even have one photo that shows her body? I guess author Lily Burana's in-person charms made the male editors let that, along with her deadly dull prose, slip by.Don't get your hopes up over STRIP CITY."
5,"A smart, honest look at an interesting world","This book is unique because it is so intellectually stimulating, rather than just trying to be titillating. Burana has a gift for storytelling and also makes a great narrator. I'd love to read whatever she writes next . . ."
1,She calls herself a writer?,"This was an incredibly disappointing book. I have friends who have stripped, and their stories are always so gripping and interesting. Lily Burana, on the other hand, is so self involved that we never quite get a feel for the world of stripping. When she does begin to offer insight, she immediately changes the subject. (Note that she is a fan of white space.)The success of this poorly written book shows how little has been written about a subject many people wonder about. I hope others in the business will take the time to find a good editor, and consider writing a skillful, honest, and true account of the stripping world."
1,Overhyped & not worth the time,"I guess an ex-stripper who can write must have dazzled the publisher, but it sure doesn't dazzle the honest reader. A bit precious, trite in many ways, with forced humor and no insight whatsover -- I was quite disappointed with this."
2,Surely we have more depth than this,"I do not and cannot believe that most Americans survive with such shallow thoughts about one another. This book will teach you how to be a leach or a parasite - or at least a member of the heard. Granted, you might be an organized, efficient leach. But, a real leader, a real contributor to our society would not waste time reading this book.Plus, I do not find itemized lists of wardrobes and detailed instructions on how to wear certain items of clothing to be all that interesting."
1,Just Plain Boring!,"This book sounded like an interesting story that might have allowed readers to submerge themselves in the forbidden world of stripping. Instead any housemother in New Jersey could of come up with this story. Just plain boring, unsexy and poorly written."
1,Yawn.,"Don't ask me how a book on a stripper could be boring, but it was. Maybe I have become jaded after reading Jenna Jameson's and Traci Lord's autobiographies. If you haven't read those yet, they are far more exciting, although you have to hide in your room to read them.This book somehow made stripping boring, and for that I must give it one star."
2,Not Very In Depth,"Ms. Burana does seem to skip away from any explanations for her ""career"", but obviously she enjoyed it or she wouldn't have done it, and wouldn't have gone to see strippers herself on her Retin A finding mission in Mexico. She treats her subject matter rather superficially, and if you really want to know what exactly what it was she did at Peepland or how she felt while degrading herself, you won't find out from this book. Maybe she just can't face it herself yet."
2,Not at all impresses,"I think this was a writers attempt to find something to get herself published. I was not impressed with her thoughts and thought she is something of an egomaniac. She got pissed when people dissed the profession, but had her own attitudes about what was right and wrong with the profession. I read this book as background research for a paper I was writing. From other readings and interviews with other performers, I think she is way off base and had her personal agenda in writing this book, and it was not to give us insight into the true live of an exotic dancer."
3,cute!,"An interesting read. Fairly well written. Some good satire about the business, but I liked ""The Stripper Diaries"" much better."
1,Boringville,"This is not so much a stripper's farewell journey across America as it is the scattered culling of a few years during which the author chose to dabble in stripping. And the enormous personal melodrama she manufactures around it. It's excruciatingly self-absorbed. There are also a few interviews with old showgirls thrown in for filler. Dry, unfocused, inauthentic."
1,slow moving,"I expected a lot more from this book. I thought it would give me an insight into a lifestyle and the type of individual that partakes of that lifestyle. Instead, it provided dull details of her so-called ""farewell tour"". I was troubled when I first read the book and she provided ... and unbelievable reasons for the journey. To me, it was clear that she did the ""tour"" (if you can call it that) as an excuse to write a book. Why not just admit it? If she wasn't upfront and honest about why she did the journey to start with, how was I to believe any other ""personal insights"" (not that much insight was provided). Don't bother with this one."
4,an enjoyable holiday read!,"Excellent book for anyone considering work as a stripper. I liked the insights about what happens behind the scenes in the clubs, as well as learning about the variety of strip clubs in the USA. It's clear from the book that the author likes being in strip clubs, not only as a worker but as a customer too. I think the writing is honest as I don't care if chronologically some of the events are shuffled... The end of the book dragged on a bit much for me as well as some of the lists, but overall liked the structure, content and language."
2,Story of Lily Burana and her life as Barbie Faust..,"I believe that Lily Burana had good intentions in writing this book but I as the reader sure didn't get it. I find her life to be fascinating yet so many details were missing. I think she had a good story idea and then along the way it seemed that she lost her focus.Her life in the dancing industry began at Peeplands in NYC which she reverts back to many times in the story about being ashamed of the types of things she did but never reveals the full story. Her true intention of her mission is to achieve closure before starting her new life, marrying her love Randy. Her story is too long and drawn out. Many details and explanations are left out. While I appreciate her efforts and the insights into this kind of life, I was unsatsified with her tale."
4,Incomplete,"As the previous reviewer stated, this is something that could have been meaningful, but wasn't as it omits many of the alternate Drama Of Exile tracks. I am fortunate enough to have that alternative version in complete form released many years ago on a small, and now impossible-to-find independent Polish label (TomK), but these songs should still be readily available today as that is the version of the album which had Nico's endorsement. In a way, it is her ""lost"" album. Aura could and should have done it, but didn't, especially considering it is a 2CD set. Instead of both complete Drama of Exile albums, the second disc contains a reissue of a very good live show dating from 1985. Will those Drama Of Exile tracks ever see the light of day again in one complete source? Perhaps not, so this release is probably as close as you can get to having both versions of that album and will have to suffice for now."
5,Suspenseful and Page Turning,"The Cabinet of Curiosities is an amazing book. Preston and Child have done an excellent job describing the characters and making them seem believable. Preston and Child have inserted realistic language that flows smoothly. Nora Kelly, an archeologist, has been called upon by Special Agent Pendergast, a mysterious FBI Agent who neglects to tell us why the case is so important. Kelly and Pendergast have discovered a tunnel filled with thirty-six bodies. As their investigation intensifies, murders start occurring. The strange thing is that the newer victims were killed the same way as previous ones. There are many suspects: could it be Mr. Brisbane, head of the New York Museum, or could it the old man that has suddenly appeared? This book kept me wanting to read more. This is possibly one of the best books written by Preston and Child."
4,Fabulous read will get you hooked on these authors,"This was the third book by these authors I have read. It is exciting, interesting and quite gruesome in parts. I finished it in about 2 days, despite having a busy family (two toddlers), a full-time job, horses and a dog - what can I say? It was worth staying up into the wee hours. Enjoy!"
1,Oooh...so ordinary.,"I want to know why the editor or proofreader didn't figure out that after the heroine and her companions had surrendered all their writing instruments before going into the museum archives they shouldn't have been able to take notes. Do the authors actually re-read what they have written? This is a shoddy, predictable book. They only saving grace is the setting in New York City. It's also too expensive for a Kindle edition."
1,amateurish,Cliche cabinet; curious how it got published; see review of riptide. Can't write anymore on this topic; too darn boring.
4,Very Good,"I started off my reading of stories staring Pendergast with Relic. I thought it was a one book set, but instead I find out it's a series. Imagine a smiling face. That was me when I found out he does star in a series. I'm not going to go so far as to say he's the next Sherlock Holmes, but that's how they portray him. They are close, but he's not Holmes. That being said, I still think he's a good main character and this is a good read."
5,ANOTHER GREAT TERRIFYING THRILLER,Preston and Child do it again. Another dark and foreboding adventure featuring Special Agent Peandergast. A must read for suspense fans.
2,Very slow read,"I found this novel quite difficult to finish. If I had never read any of the authors previous works I would not try any of their other novels. I felt that I really did not ""know"" the characters since they had been in previous books that I had not read. They were not ""fleshed out."" The premise of the story is interesting but it is a slow read. Good luck."
3,Very Unrealistic,"The beginning of this book was very interesting. It seemed interesting at first and through out the middle of the book. It had way too much detail in it. So much useless detail that I felt like putting the book down often, and did. Towards the end of the book, the authors let their imagination run away with them, and the book had a horrible ending. They should have kept ir more realistic. I enjoy a book with a story line that could possibly actually happen in real life. It makes it more interesting. This book was extremelt far fetched towards the last few chapters. I was completely unsatisfied.I give them an ""A"" for effort"
3,"Interesting, but so-so on the suspense","I enjoyed the humor and the historical tidbits, and I did like the characters. However, I also found this book 90% predictable, and I'm no Sherlock Holmes. It's difficult to review a book without giving anything away, so I hope this is useful nonetheless. I'm not spoiling anything when I say that when a novel is set in our day I would expect the writer(s) to explain why on earth the characters don't seem to use their cellphones to call for help. I also found the ""final reveal"" absolutely underwhelming. The entire time I read this book I waited for the big surprise plot twist to show that I was completely off base with my hunches, which I usually am. Alas, all happened as expected with only minor unexpected parts. That considered, the book could have been 150 pages shorter. I expected much more suspense and thrill, but, due to its transparency, this story didn't do it for me. Entertaining, but not a page-turner."
4,Cabinet of Suspense and Intrigue,"Yet another wonderful Preston/Child mystery. A story that involves the quest for eternal life on earth and where science has gone wrong. Beginning in the 19th century Five Points area of Manhattan, a doctor must kill people in order to extract a protein from the human spine while alive. In order to do this he must kidnap innocent people and tie them down inside his hidden lab to perform the extraction, afterwards succumbing to death. But, does this doctor actually achieve success, and years later is he still alive acting out these bizarre murders? Pendergrast and his cohorts team up to find this doctor and his mysterious lab and attempt to bring an end to this injustice.Never a dull moment, nor is it predictable. Full of mystery, intrigue, suspense, and action. I highly recommend this book to Preston/Child fans especially to those who always enjoy Agent Pendergrast and his witty nuances."
5,"Intelligent thriller, best of the series I have read so far","This is the third book in the series, which gives a bit more background about Agent Pendergast, who is still one of the best characters to never get any attention from the public. Smooth, suave, funny, and a true gentleman, he would be enough to warrant a reading. However, the supporting characters, painstaking research, and good old fashion suspense and thrills never let the story bog down too much. Overall, a great addition to the series."
3,"Interesting, but ultimately disappointing","this book had a lot going for it: interesting characters, wonderful and vivid descriptions of victorian new york, and an intriguing look at the resources of museums...but ultimately it sinks under the weight of a few outlandish plot twists and an anticlimactic (and generally predictable) ending.All in all, a good beach read (and a good jumping off point for learning more about history and new york)."
3,"Fun, but not their best.","I've been a Preston-Child fan since Relic. This book employed great writing technique as usual and was a fun ride, but for me, had too many contrivances, insultingly unrealistic occurences, even plot holes. The favorite character of Pendergast was too overdone this time. Although this book was exciting, I found myself shaking my head by the end."
5,The horrors of a search for anti-aging secrets.,"While preparing land for a development, the skeletons of children long dead are brought to light--buried within the walls of the foundation. The solution to the crimes involves the staff of the Museum of Natural History and a man's search for long life. Each chapter is a cliff hanger--it is impossible to put down once you begin! Look for its prequels as well."
3,Disappointing,"What a disappointing ending.The final revelation in the last chapter spoils all of the hard work these authors put into this work. This book went from a major motion picture starring Harrison Ford to a Made-For-TV movie starring Gary Busey, in the span of one chapter. Don't get me wrong, the entire book (up until the last chapter) was rather entertaining. I just liken it to Marylin Monroe belching after her ""Happy B-Day"" serenade to JFK. Why'd you have to screw it up guys? I'm still debating whether to go ahead and finish this one and read the epilogue, but I doubt the last few pages can turn this one around."
3,These authors only produce quality material!,"I have loved every book I have read by these guys. The quality of their writing is exellent. You never get the feeling that they are thinking, ""well this is just another fright book so lets not bother to be too literate about it"". They write well and do not write ""down"". The Cabinet of Curiousities was certainly an unusual topic and a fresh one. While most of their books have a touch of the supernatural or a monster or two, you can still learn a lot about many of the sciences as you enjoy the read. My big problem is slipping to the last page and spoiling the read itself, which is what I did here. However, that said I would highly recommend anythig written by these guys. Just DON'T read the last pages first!"
3,Somewhat tedious...,"I am always suspicious of books that are written by two people and having read these authors for the first time, my opinion has not changed. This book gets off to a very good start and is merrily rolling along when it starts to bog down in historical back ground. From that point on it has it's moments, but I found the going somewhat uninteresting and by the time I had waded to the end, only to have the authors explain to me what I had read I was more than a bit tired of the entire matter. I found that character development was uneven and sometimes contrary. I had expected to recommend this book based upon the early chapters, but having seen it through, I suspect you may have better ways to spend your time (and money)."
2,A letdown,"I enjoyed their other books, but this one was somewhat slow, plodding. Pendergast is always an interesting character to follow, possessed of demigodlike knowledge and capabilities, but the rest of the cast is kind of flat. And the final revelation ... Feng's great goal ... is an anticlimax, to put it mildly. You will stare in stupefecation, thinking, ""Is that it?"""
5,Their most absorbing novel yet,"I ordered this book from Amazon and read it in less than two days. And it's almost six hundred pages long. That's how well it sucks you in.If there weren't a million great reasons already to read this book, such as the chilling plot, the unexpected twists and turns, and the endearing characters, you would simply HAVE to read it for this reason alone: Pendergast. I have yet to meet a person who read the 'Relic' series and did not like this character. Intelligent, charming, and infinitely deep, he's a modern-day Sherlock Holmes with a shrouded past. He's one of the most complex characters ever written. Read it and try to prove me wrong.I've become a big enough fan of Preston and Child's books to know that this one is my all-time favorite. Though the plot is much darker than the others, it is no less terrifying or powerful. The last page is every bit as moving as the rest of the novel. ...But that doesn't mean that gives you the right to spoil it for yourself."
5,Cabinet of Curiosities,A gripping thriller with many of our favourite characters. I would recommend that people new to the authors read this one before the Diogenes Trilogy just to set the scene and to introduce Pendergast and his unique persona.
3,a decent read,"This had some good meat in it, old New York City history, nice scientific detail, some thrills and chills, and a lot of potential, but I found myself kind of cold by the end at some of the implausibility of it. I was also disappointed by the perpetrator, his rationale, and his comeuppance. I didn't hate it at all, but wasn't as blown away as I wanted to be. That said, I did appreciate the crispness of the writing, and the pacing. I just wish I didn't feel disappointed after all that build up."
3,"OK, But Just OK","I found the book to be well written and the historical items about cabinets of curiosities and 19th century New York informative, but believing the plot required just too much stretching. Talk about kinda absurd, the main character's ability to somehow trasport himself mentally back into time to interact with people he never met in surroundings where he had never visited was over the top crazy. And, as another reviewer noted, the Act of God ending was rediculousThe blurb on the front mentioed that the book was one of NPR's 100 Best Thrillers. I hope the other ones on the list are better."
5,You all have done it again!,"I loved this book for agent Pendergast and it`s fast-paced and suspenceful status. In fact I liked all of the ""heroes"". I am in the process of reading all of your books that I have not read yet. I can't wait."
4,Getting hooked on Pendergast...,"I started reading the Pendergast novels out of order, rectified that. Compared to some later books, I like the connection to his own past and family, instead of just some superhuman FBI agent. The novel was fascinating with an unexpected twist on the twist (you think you've so smartly figured out) at the end. Exciting and disturbing. As improbable as all of them, but that's half the fun."
4,what an idea!!!!!! but alas in the end...........,"It was a great suspense and mystery novel, the plot was superb, edge of your seat kind of thriller. extremely haunting idea, but....... in the last 1/4th of the novel the writers clearly blew it, atleast in my opinion. They should have continued the initial idea till the end. but they changed everything significantly in the end, and in my opinion destroyed it.imagine meeting the great villian himself !! I dont want to give away the story here. still think that it's a worhty thriller."
2,An endless string of affectations,"This novel is pretty shallow, lots of details but little substance. Characters are caricatures and stereotypes. There were some amusing and even interesting moments, but knowing what I know now, I'd rather find something else to read. This story had about as much depth as a video game."
5,"a great read, every time","I have been a ""bookworm"" all of my life, but very rarely do I re-read a book. The only exception to this has been Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and all of the Preston/Child Pendergast series. The cabinet of curiosities is my personal favourite of the series. I think I love the glimpse of NYC history it gives us, unvarnished, personal, mysterious. Maybe its because Of the characters I've come to know and respect. Absolutely the touch of the macabre, or rather the broad strokes of it that run through their books. For me they have it all, plot, character developement, suspense, superb writing, quick pacing. A true joy to settle in with on a rainy day with good music and a comfortable chair.Marcia M"
2,Not my favorite,"I have read many of the Preston/Child books with this one being the least impressive. This book provides plenty of suspense, however I felt let down by the ending. If you would like to read a good book by these guys then read either Relic or Thunderhead(my favorite) you won't be dissappointed."
3,The Cabinet of Curiosities,"I've read and re-read all of the books by these authors. And was eagerly awaiting this selection. Perhaps it was undue expectations from the anticipation, but this one lands near the bottom of their list for me.The historical basis is once again fascinating and educational. The story line bizarre but believable. Penderghast returns for the third (and hopefully last) time. He comes off as ridiculously super human.The story line moved well and kept me interested. But, it just didn't possess the burning, page turning, can't wait 'til the end, of so many of their other books.Sorry guys"
5,The Cabinet of Curiosities,"This one should really be read before any of the Pendergast thrillers that follow it, as many things in this book explain, and sometimes are explained be events in later books."
4,Surprisingly... surprising!,"You know how you can always tell ""Ensign Fodder"" by the red shirt he's wearing? Not so in this one. I was actually wrong about the fate of one of the characters! That hasn't happened in a long while, and any book creative enough to stump me gets high praise indeed. And while the ending wasn't exactly the way I would want it, it was still a great book and I'd recommend it to anyone who's read any of the other Child/Preston books and enjoyed them (this was my first exposure, and I don't think reading them out of order detracted much at all since each is a solid stand-alone story)."
5,Huge Fan,"I love all of their books, particularly the ones featuring Agent Pendergast. Can't be beat for pure page-turning fun."
4,Very Good,This was a very good book. Very well written and the character of D'Agosta and Pendegrast makes for a thrilling ride.
5,Another great Preston-Child novel,"This is my favourite book out of them all. For those who rated this book low, you probably don't appreciate this kind of writing. 'a bit boring at times...' This book is never boring. The suspence was killing me when I was reading this book! It's rich with science, superb vocabulary, and ...suspence! A great read, I'd recomend this to anyone.S.P."
2,And I waited a year for this book?,"After waiting over a year for this book to be published and visiting the authors' website for tidbits, I can't help being disappointed. So contrived. A total fantasy, not at all as ""page-turning"" as their other novels. I felt that it should have ended at least three chapters before it did."
1,Don't bother,I figured out who did it the moment the character was introduced. It was also too long. Save your money.
2,Does everyone talk like that?,"You know, as I have begun this habit of writing reviews, I soon found myself giving almost everything 4 or 5 stars. Wondering, critically of course, will I actually read something of lesser value? Well, this book fulfilled my nagging dillema. Now, I'm not going to downplay this book. It was a good read for the most part; however, my only complain is that when reading this book I felt as if I were reading a book which contained a land of nothing but absolute geniouses. A great example of this is early in the book when Nora goes to a women's house whom is of the age of about 90. This 90 year old women had a vocabulary greater than that of any scientist explaining molelecular physics. After that, I simply could not help but to think that the authors were attempting some kind of ego-tistical prize by outdoing each other in semantics. Yes the book was good, however, every book needs a character that either equates in knowledge with the reader or is of lesser intellect."
1,Ridiculous Pricing,"So it's $23 for the kindle version, and under $10 for the paperback? How about going for the $.01 used copy instead. This is just ridiculous!Great book though, I'd just recommend buying it used."
5,Can't....Put......Down,"I was so thrilled when I'd come across the newest Preston & Child book... I didn't even know it was out.... but WOW what an awesome story it turned out to be! The only negative was that it caught and held onto my attention so well that I finished it within a matter of days.They brought characters back again, Nora Kelly from Thunderhead and Smithback from Relic, Reliquary, and Thunderhead, amoung other characters. That made it even more of a treat to read, but theres just something about their novels that make them sooooo satisfying to read. Definately worth picking up! =)"
4,Definitely their best since Relic,"This book was so gruesome and often even upsetting I recommend that unless you are possessed of a strong stomach, do not pick it up. If you love horror, however, you will like this foray into twisted evil. If it doesn't shock you, you have become more jaded than Enoch Leng, the ""villain"" of the piece. Four stars instead of five because some occurrences seem too far-fetched, but if you're willing to suspend disbelief, you will find it a memorable read. I had to keep putting it down to prepare myself to take on the next creepy, dark and scary chapter."
4,7 TIMES A CHARM,"Well, Preston and Child are back again with book #7. It was a while for this book to come out, but I thought it was worth it. Again we are shown the seamy side of New York, through superb descriptions of crumbling buildings and dank, moldy basements. This story we are reintroduced to Pendergrast and Nora Kelly as well as Smithback the reporter, and they all have good chemistry.That, I loved about this book, however the plot was not that believable and I figured out who the killer was halfway through. But did I not like this book? I loved it, these guys should be the primer for how an action book should be written, they don't dottle on with too much dialogue or unnecessary information. The descriptions of the past were top notch and the build up to the end was very well planned out. As always these guys never really leave any lose ends. And The Cabinet of Curiosities is no exception. Good book, I can't wait to read Lincoln Child's new solo book Utopia."
5,Top Drawer Puzzle of a Mystery!,"First the bad news!The bad guy here does not really fit, and there are a few characters who seem almost cartoonish. Otherwise, this is a real knockout, with a really eccentric FBI man, whose investigatory tools include using renaissance-era ""Memory Palace"" techniques. There is plenty of arcania here as we explore the underground vaults of the NYC Natural History Museum, the mean and oz-like streets of the great city, and the bureaucratic maneuvers of those who run the city, the police, and the museum. Also plenty of bizarre PT Barnum-like late 19th century curiosities, and bone digging. So if you like an accessible, educational, mysterious tour through NY of now and 100-plus years ago, you can't miss with one!"
2,A Thrilling Ride to Tedium,"A gangbusters beginning plot that carries the interest through most of the book, but then gets mired down in some pretty good writing that simply goes on, and on, and on, and on -- to no apparent purpose.I'll not repeat the theme of the book. That's well handled by others. I like the story; I just wish the authors would tell it.If you have found the formula for prolonging your life, you may wish to spend time with this novel. Otherwise, life's too short."
5,This one is a page turner!,This is the kind of book that keeps you up too late at night because you just can't put it down.......you MUST know what happens next. Great story line. Desperately hoping for a sequel!!
3,Great beginning - Somewhat illogical ending,"Great writing skills were demonstrated by the authors, but the illogical thinking of one of the main characters at the climax left me saying to myself that ""he wouldn't be thinking that while being wounded and being chased by a man with a gun"". The first three quarters of the book kept me on the edge of my chair."
3,"Good, entertaining mystery of murder past & present","The Cabinet of Curiosities by Douglas Preston, Lincoln Child is the 3rd book in the Pendergast series. I had not read the earlier two books before this one, so I may have missed out on some back story, though it was perfectly easy to jump right in and follow along on the story. The story revolved around Pendergast, an unconventional, sophisticated, somewhat mysterious FBI agent who shows up at a NY construction scene just as bones are discovered in a building which is being torn down. Realizing that the bones date back centuries, he asks an archaeologist from the New York Museum, Nora Kelly, to help him. Nora and Pendergast quickly realize that the bones indicate a serial killer from the past; almost as quickly, the copycat murders being occurring in the present. They investigate both murders, past & present, with help from 5th generation Irish-American cop Patrick O'Shaughnessy and New York Times investigative reporter William Smithback."
3,"Eh, it was okay...","This was the first time I had read a Preston and Child book. I read a lot of reviews that highly praised this book. And I honestly expected it to be a lot better then what it was. To me personally, I found this book to be kind of ""high schoolish,"" meaning it doesn't really fit my idea for an adult book? (Minus the language in certain areas of the book) But I can say that they did a good job building your suspense up, however they dropped it just as fast and moved on to another topic. So with that being said, I just found this book to be ""OK"" and I doubt I will read anymore books by Preston and Child."
1,"One of the Worst I Have Ever Read (well, listened to).","I will never pick up a book by these two again. The main character had Holmes-like abilities, but his were attained by magic, not by deduction and observation. For example, to help solve this murder, he was able to go back in time 100 years (in his head) and watch what happenned. GIVE ME A BREAK! The characters were stereotypical (especially the NYCity Policemen) with childish dialogue, and the ending was pathetic. Luckily, I wasted no time reading this book, I listened to it while commuting.If you like wasting time, read this book, otherwise, RUN!!! ..."
4,good,"Thanks, Randi, for yet another useful book. This is a useful book, well worth the read. Nobody with paranormal abilities can stand up to Randi! Good show!"
4,Fantastic book but feels out of date,"This book is readable and very thorough. The only complaint I can make is that, as it refers to events mainly in the 1980s, it now comes across as dated. Having said this, the book is well worth buying. I wish I could convince my Bible-bashing geriatric neighbour, who receives a mountain of religious junk mail, that what it says is true!"
5,For those not afraid of the truth,"I remember six or so years ago when Peter Popoff, was exposed as a fraud and how he used a microphone and scouts in his rallies to find out information ahead of time so he could pretend to ""know"" that someone was in need of help and how he even planted people with crutches etc for healings. Thru reason and scientific fact James Randi shows why these smoke and mirror televangelists are like the small man behind the curtain in the Wizard of Oz. Like me he isn't against reading or looking into other ideas and beliefs, since true knowledge is power. Personally I think every religious or new ager should read this book if for no other reason that it will at least plant the suggestion of things to pay attention to. It is like learning about the sleight of hand tricks that magicians use. The only difference is that magicians will tell you up front that it is an illusion, a sleight of hand and a ""trick""."
5,You'll never look a these guys the same again!,"This book was great! It truly exposes these ""men of God"" for who they really are: Scam artists! I still can't believe these men are still on T.V. selling their lies! It goes to show you just how gullible we human beings can be. You owe it to yourself to read this book. I'm really thankful to have a man like James Randi out there doing what he's doing. Keep it up!Sincerely,Sean Roscoe"
4,An expose of religious con artists,"Mr. Randi has done an excellent job of pulling the cloak off the charlatans and professional liars in this book. He gives examples and proof, using the ""faith healers"" own words; what better way to do it. Let their own words and actions trap themselves. I strongly suggest that even Christian believers should read this book, and stop giving money (if they have been so foolish to have done so) to these mountebanks . If the book has a shortcoming, it is somewhat dated. Since these religious con artists are constantly popping up, as they find an easy way to wealth, many of the newer ones are not mentioned in the book, primarily the ""anointed one&quot...Some of the others, however, are still around...Buy this book and read it. Mr. Randi speaks the truth about those that don't speak the truth."
5,Keep your eye on your wallets.,"Ever wondered how the ""Faith Healers"" of EVERY description run their con games. They are finally and incontrovertably exposed as the money grubbing frauds they are in this wonderfully writen and documented book by James Randi. You will never look at ""psychics"" and ""faith healers"" the same way again."
2,Not so insane at all,"This is an all right album if you're not listening too closely to the lyrics. However, as the title implies they're supposed to be insane. But I get a feeling it's inanity for it's own sake which I don't find very funny. I find his album American Scream to be a much better production."
5,5 minute install,"This product is one of the easiest to install that I've ever come across. A couple of screws on the side panel of my Jeep Liberty, unplug one cable, plug this in, replace panel, and you're done. I decided to leave the trailer dongle inside away from the weather. I just tuck it into the net pocket on the panel when I'm not using it. Installation couldn't have been easier."
5,Could not have been any Easier,"This is a great product at a tremendous price. The quality of the product is outstanding, it literally could not have been any better. The instruction were a little vague. If you know anything about changing out any car electronics you are used to popping loose trim panels and stuff and are familiar with the force it takes to get some of those things loose. The hardest part about this install was finding a good place to GROUND the harness, I just ended up running the ground wire under the jeep and finding a spot underneath. This is a must have for trailer owners and a must buy if you want simplicity."
3,Bad instructions,"I have a 2005 Liberty, and the instructions doesn't match as someone else mentioned. This is not the quick connect type that you plug into where the lights are. It's a much larger plug, and I believe it should be connected before the light, I just don't see where.There is no cargo strap hook at described in step 2 and therefore I don't see how the panel come off. I talked to Jeep, and they said I could get to it from underneath, by the wheel well. I tried, but I didn't have any success with that. If someone has instructions on how this should be done, please post them here.Here are Hopkins' instructions [...]"
4,happy pikachu,"My son loves pikachu,this one is well made and a good size to travel everywhere with him.A good one to add to his evergrowing collection!! GREAT PRICE."
3,Its a great toy for all the pokemon lovers,This toy is a must have for pokemon lovers.I got my little brother this toy for his birthday and he plays with it everyday.The kids will go nuts over this.
1,NBA Top 10 Greatest DVD,This has got to be one of the worst NBA DVD's ever. A panel of judges stuck in their own era. Very little highlights and videos. Very unsatisfied
3,Tomlin TX Review,The XL is a good fit for husky guys. On initial uses the waterproofing seems to be very good. Longer term is unknown as I haven't had the jacket that long. I'd expect better features especially in the area of pockets for this price point. Side seam outside pockets are difficult and clumsy especially if you are driving your car and want to reach in. There should be a full sized interior pocket not the dinky i-pod holder. The zip up feature on pockets is good. I suspect that this coat (even without insert) might be really hot in warmer weather but it's been cold here so far and for that it is fine.
5,Great series! My 11-year-old son loves it!,"We saw the digital animation movie first, and my son watches the DVD over-and-over. So, we had to get this series. He loves it!"
4,Pot top,"I have a 45 year old 1-1/2 qt farberware pot & wanted another as the size is perfect & the handle on mine is beginning to crack. (after all these years.) This new pot is slightly deeper, but otherwise just as good. My only complaint is that the ""cover"" does not fit correctly. It doesn't go all the way into the pot.It sits up a little."
5,A not to be missed work!,"I had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Olmos talk in person about the making of ""Americanos"" and now have the pleasure of enjoying the book again and again. The photos are hauntingly charming, poignant and vital and I can guarantee they will stay in your heart and mind long after you put the book down.What ""Americanos"" has to say about Latinos is so vitally important. Olmos, in his preface, says ""...Too often, only one culture of Latino culture is apparent. That is the culture that we see from our car windows, on newscasts, in restaurants and from stadium seats..."" ""Americanos"", however gives us an insider's view, a look into the very heart and soul of our Latino brothers and sisters and reveals a people, in Olmos's words, ""...who are diverse in culture, color, ideas and dreams..."""
2,A bit too much attitude,"The photographs were excellent -- just looking at them makes you want to know and like these people.The narrative brought me up short. I'm one of those (apparently) rare individuals who believe American values aren't so bad that we should feel grateful to foreigners who come here and teach us how to live.Most Americans feel a certain sense of good fortune for having been born in the United States. The narrative in this book leaves the impression that ""Americanos"" don't think America is so great, have no intention of ""being assimilated"" (in other words, becoming Americans), and feel they by rights already own the place anyway.I'm no xenophobe, but this book left me with a strong bad impression. Maybe I should have given it 5 stars. Maybe it's a book every American ought to read carefully."
4,Great Performance Great Audio Video Quality Lacking,The playlist and the audio track on this DVD are amazing. It's a great mix of new songs with the old. The only real problem with this DVD is the video quality. There is a lot of digital errors in the video but it is watchable. I have seen the same concert on HD Net and the master is not the problem. My theory is that they spent so much attention on the audio quality that they sacrificed video to get it. There is only so much room on a DVD.
5,A must for DMB fans and musicians,"Absolutely fabulous concert by DMB. Along with the Central park concert, this is the second DVD you must have if you love Dave Matthews band, and not only if you are a hardcore fan. Any musician or music lover should watch this. Great sound and video quality, solid and vibey performance of Dave and the band.This also exists as an mp3 download at 256 kbs from DMB website.Together with the Lisbon concert (""live trax 10) is one of the best live recordings from Dave Matthews Band."
1,DM is growing tedious,"Every tune turns into a hammering 'jam' of overdriven drums and non-stop electric violin stomping the same riff into the ground over and over. Dave's ridiculous faux southern accent, put on for the Atlanta crowd, I guess, is annoying right from the start. Was he drunk? The set list doesn't matter because the live band makes them all sound the same after one or two minutes. The sound quality in stereo 2.0 is good. But overall, the band no longer seems relevant."
4,Dave Matthews live at Piedmont Park,"I got this DVD for my boyfriend for a Christmas present. He absolutely loves it! He watches it all the time, still. I would reccomend this product for anyone who enjoys Dave."
5,Looking Inside for Questions regarding the Outside,"Not sure what and can't seem to fathom why you or your teenager can't seems to process situations the same way? Just as we suspect that we are very much the same yet believe that each individual is unique in their experiences, well your teenage experience can't begin to help you understand the complexities of how the teenagers struggle to make meaning of what goes on today. At least for you and I, times were a lot simplier then."
4,Beautifully filmed and unflinchingly honest.,Lovely but increasingly painful movie revealing an unexamined corner of WWII and Muslim/Jewish relations as well as exploring relationships between women and between women and men within the constraints of different cultures. Beautifully filmed and unflinchingly honest.
2,Not for XTLU Extreme,"If you're buying a new BowFlex, don't do what I did and order the upgrade before getting your machine. My Bowflex Extreme XTLU came with a mat and the 310LB upgrade and there's no room for adding extra 50 pound rods, unless you replace two lighter rods with them. That's all this kit is is two 50 pound rods."
3,410 lb. rod upgrade,"I specifically bought this as a 410# upgrade to my 210# system because of the reviews I read for the 310# upgrade being difficult to install. Upon receiving these rods with the slide on bracket I discovered that the bracket was slightly different than what I needed (it had two large slots that did not line up with my existing bracket), it did not fit. I did have two open holes for the rods, so I took the two new rods off the bracket and installed them in the two open holes on the existing bracket (it was easy to do) and they now work fine. If, at some point, I want to go to 410#s I will have to get a bracket that fits with two new rods. By the way, the new rods seem stiffer and more difficult to pull than the old ones, probably from being new and less stressed."
4,NOT for the Power Pro as advertised,"This product WILL NOT mount onto the Power Pro; the rod box's slots will only fit later models of Bowflex. The Power Rods themselves are great and MAY be removed from the rod box and used as a ""310 pound upgrade"" (the 50 lbs rods are the same) but the ROD BOX itself is absolutely NOT for the Power Pro classic or XTL. The Power Pro/XTL box is apparenly NO LONGER AVAILABLE (not even directly from Bowflex)."
4,This upgrade is NOT for the Power Pro or original Motivator...,"Per the Amazon description:""Product Features100 lb. rod upgrade; 2-50lb rods, attachmentsBoost your total resistance to 410 poundsFor Ultimate/Ultimate 2, Motivator, Xtreme/Xtreme 2, Sport, Blaze and Power Pro Bowflex Fitness Machines310 pound upgrade required before upgrading to 410 poundsNo-Time-Limit Power Rod warranty""This kit will NOT fit the original Power Pro or Power Pro XTL. The power rod box on the original Power Pro has a different v-shaped groove pattern from the square pattern that the bracket of this 410 lb upgrade kit. According to Bowflex, the 410lb upgrade kit for the Power Pro is no longer available. If you need 100lbs of resistance rods, though, for $73 this is still the least expensive way to get them. It appears that there may be some aftermarket solutions for upgrading higher than 310 lbs on the original Power Pro now, but you still need to buy the rods."
4,Bowflex 410lb upgrade,"The Rod's were good, the mounting bracket did not fit my Bowflex model even though it was listed in the product description. Was able to make it work by bolting it to the existing power rod bracket."
5,Bowflex Sport,"I have the bowflex sport and these worked great, easy to install and prolonged the life of my bowflex. These are for the 410lb add on only, the rods in the very back of the machine."
1,"Used not New, You may not get what you paid for...","The item itself is functionally as expected. I paid for and ordered a new item but what Amazon shipped me 3 times in a row was very used, not new. The Power Rods had many thick scuffs and scratches through the surface of the finish on the rods. After having Amazon send me two replacement shipments and all 3 items having the same type of damage that you would associate with a used product I gave up. Amazon customer service made a good effort to fix the issue and in the end issued a $30 credit when I reluctantly decided I could live with the damage. I wanted to make sure everyone out there had the heads up in case you face the same issue with your order(s). It's the first time I've had such an issue with Amazon in the hundreds of orders I've placed so they still have a great track record with me."
2,Rods Bent,"I ordered these earlier this year. The rods were extremely bent.I thought they would straighten out but haven't. They were an upgrade to the 310 lbs upgrade. I'll see if I can get a replacement, otherwise Bowflex is great."
2,Oops the description indicated that this upgrade is compatible with the power pro line,"It is not. The backing does not fit the grooves of the Power Pro. They (Amazon) needs to alter the wording on the upgrade. I was looking forward to the increased resistance and now it seems lacking would be a good word for it.The Bowflex is a great model and I use it several times weakly and has kept me strong. I still return to the gym and I am able to lift the same or more then when I left(8 years ago). As for the size issue, well that is more diet related and genetics. (Check out muscleandstrength.com website for training programs.) I am very happy to be exercising at home on my BowFlex. More resistance like a 410 pound addition would be phenomenal!!!"
5,working great for me,"These only receive light use, but they work great, they are super warm and comfortable and I would recommend them strongly."
2,David Lee Roth - 'Your Filthy Little Mouth' (Warner Bros.) 2 1/2 stars,"Not counting his first release, that four-track 'Crazy From The Heat' EP, this was Roth's fifth solo effort. Tunes here that I sort of thought were okay include ""She's My Machine"", ""Cheatin' Heart Cafe"", ""No Big 'Ting"" and the sassy title track ""Your Filthy Little Mouth"". Guess the fact that veteran guitarist Steve Hunter (Alice Cooper,1975-76) played on this record really didn't hurt. Pretty much for the David Lee Roth and Han Valen completists. Mediocre arena rock to say the least. Upside is, of course these days, Roth is back with Van Halen. Anxious to hear new material from this veteran band."
2,Not Like the original vinyl,"The disc contains 4 tracks, three of which are not identical with the original vinyl release on Verve. It seems as if totally different mixes (if not demos) were used for this CD reissue."
1,"Like it, or not......This is pretty much how Bruce was.","As one that admired Bruce's talent, and he WAS talented. However,as Richie Furay observed, from the beginning of Buffalo Springfield, Bruce's drug experimentation,blasted him off to Dimension Z, never really returning, for the rest of his life.By the time his life was over in 2004,Bruce no longer resembled the guy that he was. This album is only noteworthy as the one solo album he ever did. He could really play--but chose not to. What a waste."
2,Laughably bad in places.....,"From the liner notes: ""They released it and I retired. I had a laugh at the industry's expense."" - Bruce Palmer.That tells you just about everything you need to know about this album. Should be a one-star album, but raised to 2-stars based on Palmer's sense of humor."
2,Family Tree Maker Deluxe Collector's Edition 8.0,"Do not waste your money on this version or any other packaged version that includes CDs with it. If you have a computer, access to the Internet and can type, you need not spend your money buying this product. The only thing worthwhile in this is the basic Family Tree Maker software. Everything else that is in this package, and more, can be found on ancestry.com!!"
2,Family Tree Maker Deluxe Collector's Edition 8.0,"I did not find this product useful! So far, I have not found ANY new links or tree members as a result of this software (and I only have about a dozen at this writing). The software is slow and the search engines are poorly written (if you have a tree with only one member, and search for a surname beginning with 'T', the s/w wants to start with the 'A' index). You cannot search a CD unless the s/w finds an index reference to that particular CD. The instruction manual is **really** bad - and lacks directions to 'advanced' features."
1,As useful as a marshmallow crash helmet,"Bought this software believing it would allow me to trace my family, and got a bunch of records that are of no relevance to anyone who doesn't hail from America. The template you can use is the only thing of use but is not worth the money the product costs. I would suggest you avoid this product unless you are only interested in American research."
5,Endless Fun,"My 2 year old learned how to drive a car already! He is now almost 4 and is still in love with his jeep. I'm amazed at how well this toy has held up and how it's always ready to go, charge after charge. I definitely recommend this toy!"
1,Ugh! I do not like this stroller.,"I have had this stroller for my daughter for 6 months now. I put it together myself. The parent cup holder doesn't snap on like it is supposed to and the cover for newborns doesn't fit the stroller so there are two things that I just threw in the closet. Like a pp said the top does not block the sun, the back wheels are very wide (forget about restraunts, stores, and just fitting in areas in general), the front wheels lock up a lot, and it is very very hard to get it unfolded. I didn't have problems with the fabric unraveling. The storage bin under the stroller would trap the diaper bag so it made it difficult to get stuff out when she was sleeping, and it also does not fully recline. I don't have the receipt and I've had it for so long (I figured I would give it a chance) or I would return it. Now I am looking for another stroller."
3,eh,"I have owned this stroller for my son for over a year now, and it's okay.Pros: sturdy, comfortable for him, good for walksCons: handle is a pain, big and bulky which makes it a hassle to bring it to mall, stores, etcIt's a pretty good stroller, but too awkward for shopping etc. I would not buy this again."
5,I can taste the food just like MY mother made!,"This is one great book aboutSicilian food preparation. It brought back memories and tastes from home. Some of the recipies I have never seen in print before. Marvelous anecdotal memories, as well. A great read."
2,Glad I didn't buy it,"I was interested in this cookbook after seeing some of the good reviews it got on amazon and was able to get it from my library via Inter Library Loan. I have to say I was disappointed. I found the stories the author included in the cookbook to be very poorly written, poorly organized, and poorly placed with in the cookbook. Writing is clearly not one of the author's strong points. The recipes were the same recipes you can find it any other american-italian cookbook, and were not written well either. I am so glad I did not actually buy this book as it would have been a waste of money."
4,Hardcore & raw,I love movies that are as raw as this. Uncensored brutality gets answered with uncensored brutality. An important story about becoming the anti-victim in a time when protecting yourself was frowned upon gets portrayed in this dog eat dog movie! While the rape in this movie is pretty raw & brutal the nudity is pretty tame. The action & violence is through the roof. I would like to see Tarantino remake this film since he would keep it as raw & uncut as this first installment was.
4,Much more detail than you'll need to know for the exam,"This book should be required reading for anyone who is a member of a software development team in an enterprise environment. Based on the Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF), it provides in-depth, realistic examples and case studies. It does not, however, map very closely to the 70-100 exam. Most of the questions in the exam pertain to relational database design, yet the topic is covered very lightly in this book. You would be well-advised to study relational database design thoroughly before taking the exam."
3,"Good material, very thorough and detailed","Lots of information is provided that can help you prepare for the exam (such as pros/cons of technologies to use, design methods to implement, security issues etc). However, I have used the book selectively as not all the information related is relevant to pass the test (especially concentrate on Ch7-11). Another book to supplement is ""Test Success"", as it will also give you a good view of what exam will cover. After I passed the test, in addition to two books mentioned above, you do need 1-2yrs of experience in software design (especially, data modeling) to pass, lots of concentration, and yes, do use up all the time you need. Don't rush through the exam. The book will definitely stay on our shelf to be referenced in the engagments to come to help the client design the system correctly. But, again, not all info in the book is needed to pass the test."
2,"Well written book, but does not prepare you for the exam","I wished I had listened to the other reviewers before buying this book.In the books defense, it is very well written, has good examples, and cites plenty of sources if you want to read further.The bad part, I read the first half of this book and the information had only the most remote connnection to the real exam. You should know, in fairness, that I gave up at this point and didn't read the rest of the book. It did look like the remainder of the book was more relevent to the exam, but I was too frustrated by that time.I relied on Transcenders heavily to prepare me for this exam and did OK (I failed the first attempt by a small margin - 1%).My advice: If you are getting your MCSD to go into distributed application development using MSF, it would be a good read. If you are not, find another tool.This review was written 8/26/00. I can be reached at MGrosso@bwn.net if anyone has any further questions."
1,wasted days and wasted nights,"spent studying this book to pass exam 70-100. Good material in the book, but no resemblance to material covered in exam 70-100. Recommend transcender tests and 'MCSD Test Success' books instead."
2,Good Information. Bad Preparation.,"I can definately say there is a lot of good information in this book. If you want an high level understanding of Microsoft Technologies, this is the book for you....BUT, if you want to pass the Microsoft exam (70-100), try Transcender.com. This is common theme that you will notice for the Microsoft Press Materials. Good Material... Bad Test Preparation.After receiving and reviewing the transcender material, I immediately passed the exam. The exam test whether you know how to structure databases (fields and tables), if you understanding event sequences, etc....which is not covered in this Microsoft Press Book.After reading this book and failing my first try at the exam, I was a little disappointed, so I called Microsoft. They suggested that I ""use some of the Third Party Materials""...Good Luck."
1,The book is NOT a training kit for MCSD 70-100 exam.,"There is a BIG disconnect between what the book delivers and what its intended purpose is. This book will not help you in any way to pass the 70-100 MCSD exam. The book talks about MSF, which in it self is great but has almost no bearing to what is actually asked at the test. Having passed MCSE and MCDBA I was totally disappointed in this book as a training kit for MCSD"
1,Doesn't prepare you for the test,"While this is a good book, it fails dramatically in its stated purpose - 'Training Kit'. This book will not help you pass the test."
5,Exam 70-100,"I have not bought this book, so your probably wondering why I am writing this. I just thought I would say though, I bought the Transcender test for this exam and studied hard for about 3 weeks. I failed the MS test with a score of 610. The exam I took was very, very tough. My advice to anyone who is going to take this exam would probably be to buy this book also, I passed both VB exams with the VB books and VB Transcenders. The Transcender for this exam is not right on the money like it is for the VB exams."
2,Crazy 'case study',"can't believe so many people think the case study in this book is a good read. Load of useless crap. Who wants to read about what Dan says to Marta, and that Bill likes to go fishing. If I want to read stories, I'll go buy a Harry Potter book."
3,This book will not help you with the 70-100 exam,"The book is an interesting read, but it won't help you pass the 70-100 exam.For that, I'd recommend Database Design for Mere Mortals, plus Transcender."
4,Great book but not tied to real exam,"If I used only this book to prepare for the exam, I would certainly fail. However, it's a great book if you want to learn something about methodologies and concepts used in designing big, ""real world"" solutions. Off course, from the Microsoft point of view. The book's main buzzword is MSF. Besides learning about it theorethically, you can see how it can be applied in ""real world"" situation by following a single but big case study about imagined Chicago based company that adopted MSF in order to solve some business problems.If you are a developer but you've never looked at the software project from the big perspective, after reading this book you will probably wish to."
3,"Good Reading, Bad Test Prep","This book is different in that it matches each chapter of new information with a story-book-style chapter in which characters talk about and use the concepts explained in previous chapters. This ""Case Study"" is most helpful in cementing these abstract principles that tend to get convoluted in Microsoft's ""bullet-point"" style of teaching. However... supplement this book with an exam cram book for the test. This book is a good overview, but not adequate exam prep."
1,Very different from Microsoft Exam,"Do not expect that it will help you to pass the Microsoft Exam 70-100. Although, book is good with its content but too much theory, while exam covers the practicle aspects. Also actual exams contains special module questions which cannot be prepared through the book.Petewww.ucertify.com"
1,Don't buy.,This book is ok if you want a general reference for developing. It has nothing to offer in regards to preparing for the 70-100 exam. Transcender practice test is the only resourse that i found helpful.
2,nothing about 70-100,"This is a great book including very interesting information and a well explained case study, but if you want to pass EXAM 70-100 then go and buy yourself another book. Over 700 pages without any usefull information for the exam. Be sure exam is not about application design, it is about relational database design, and the best book I've ever read about this is the one from Rebecca Riordan, again from MS Press.. If you want to pass the exam go and buy yourself a copy of Designing Relational Databases by Riordan.. This training kit won't help you!"
1,Save Your Money,"Very interesting reading, but nothing to do with the exam. Spend your money on the Transcender."
2,NOT what you'd think,"i am annoyed that i read this book. 650+ pages of well-written, interesting (for the most part) but NON-APPLICABLE information. i don't think anything mentioned in the book was on the test. i had a pretty strict deadline for passing the test and really wish i would have spent my valuable hours on something else.i did use the Transcender tests and they were good for getting the hang of what the questions wanted, although the pass/fail mark seemed a little high at 85%.after i was scheduled for the test i found out about these people troytec.com, they are probably worth a look if you are actually looking for test prep material.i highly discourage you from reading this book if what you want is something that will help you pass the test. it did offer good info on team-building and team/enterprise projects but since the test i got had nothing to do with that, it was not good study material."
2,Well written but too verbose,"There is no argument that the author is articulate in conveying technical topics. This is a rarity in technical texts. However, this book is huge, almost overwhelming.If you think that you are getting inside information by purchasing a Microsoft book, think again. This book is aimed at teaching, not reviewing. The material is also pretty dry reading."
1,Don't Buy This Book ! ! !,"This book is full of interesting information, but is WORTHLESS as a tool for preparing for the 70-100 test. Such a shame. OVer 700 pages yet it fails to cover the topics for the test! As others have mentioned, use the Transcender tests. They are right on and give exceptional practice with the test format as well as the test content."
1,A Waste of Time,"660 pages, 10 case studies, 14 chapters, 14 chapter tests, 25 questions on the ""practice"" exam. Absolutely NO reference to taking the 70-100 exam. Let me repeat NOT ONE QUESTION from this book is relevant to taking the exam.I have programmed in VB since VB1 for Dos - VB 6, 10 years. Decided to get the MCSD certification for easier job hunting and to help my skills. My thinking it is a Microsoft Press book, it is a Microsoft exam. Sounds good right! WRONG.HTH"
1,USELESS - ZERO STARS,"As an MCSD, MCP+SB and industry professional, I recommend you steer clear on the useless book. It completely misses 70-100: it did not help me at all. It is an OK book for software cycles, project management, etc. Save your money and frustration and buy another book for 70-100."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This is (contrary to popular opinion) a very interesting book about system development methodology -- well thought out and clear. However, the subject matter has almost nothing at all in common with the 70-100 exam. This book addresses high level methodology, but the exam covers lower level technologies such as data and process modeling, and ""extracting"" simple requirements from complex prose. The title of this book is exceedingly misleading. Buyer beware!"
4,FRESH and Interesting,I think this album is fresh and interesting. There's a little bit of everything from a ballad to a hard rocking roller coaster ride. I beleive they deserve the exposure so everyone can get on this rocket ride called rock n roll. Make sure to Buy it!
4,Amazing introduction,"Peter Gahan's introduction to G.B. Shaw's play Candida in the new Penguin Classics edition shows an old favorite play in a very new light. Not only does Gahan read between the lines of the plot, he also draws the reader's attention to on-stage props, names, and even off-stage happenings, which might otherwise easily go unnoticed. He makes some truly amazing connections with a multitude of other works of art, such as Yeats' poetry, pre-Raphelite paintings, and Wagnerian opera. This new edition of Candida is worth buying for its introduction alone."
5,Love triangle that raises the question of what good women really want and need,This was hilarious. I loved the way the illusion and the reality were exact opposites. Shaw is the master of the art of turning things upside down and making them humorous while also bringing up serious issues and causing us to really think about them.Here we have a love triangle that raises the question of what good women really want and need.This story was smart and funny. I loved it and wanted more when it was over. I'll have to buy another one of his books. I just love his style.
3,had to read it for a book club,"I bought this for the sole purpose of reading it for a book club. I was, of course, hoping that it would be a good read as well. My best review of it is that I was just happy it was short. Perhaps I am a neanderthal and this is some great masterpiece that I am missing out on entirely, but there you have it."
3,Jerry Lewis plays it straight to Tony Curtis.,"When the opening credits run, and the supporting female cast members `measurements' are shown beneath their names, you have no doubt you're in the 60's, bedroom farce, defined. In a roll reversal of sorts Jerry Lewis plays straight man to Tony Curtis this time around.Bernie Lawrence (Curtis) is an American newspaper man stationed in Paris, the man for whom there is never too many airline hostesses, just too little time. His delicately balanced, and timed to the minute, 4-way love life comes totally unwound when old pal Robert Reed (Lewis) arrives for an unexpected stay.Cliché after cliché, time stamped in most every shot, Boeing Boeing is a tribute to a different type of filmmaking than we see today, a different morality, a different approach to comedy.Wonderful Paris sights are an added treat. Recommended."
3,"Silly, outdated, but fun","I vaguely remembered this movie from seeing it as a teenager, and decided to watch it again. It hasn't aged very well - it was dumb and sexist at the time and is GLARINGLY dumb and sexist now. But, if you like this kind of old-fashioned 'sex comedy romp' (like I do when I'm in the mood) and/or you like Tony Curtis and Jerry Lewis, who both do a fine job with the material, you may enjoy this. Just turn off your brain when the opening credits come up and you'll get a few laughs."
2,Mostly misses,2 1/2Mildly engaging alternative which at best recalls an updated Cocteau Twins though more often rambles with undercooked experimentation and semi-assertive vocalizations with a declining second side.
1,Don't waste your money!,I anticipated this book to be terrific but was extremely disappointed. It is filled with poor photographs submitted by fans and there is absolutely nothing written in the chapters that is new or exciting. I am still hoping that the publishers of Higher & Higher will be doing their own retrospective book of the Moodies career.
3,Moodies Starter Book Mostly,Hi all. If you have read most of H & H mags you really don't need this book. It has condensed reprints from them. General information is good but findable on the web. Nice B & W picts. Overall presentation is good I was just hoping for some more indepth stories.
2,A bit of a let down,"I have to admit, there is great artwork in this book, but the stories are not quite what I'd expect to find in a published work. I'd recommend reading the fanzine Higher and Higher or wait for the official book to come out. The book was a disappointment to me. Better fan books have been published in limited edition formats and those, in my opinion, are worth more than this one."
3,It's Good for the Beginning Fan.,"There's not a lot here that you can't basically retrieve from various Moody websites, especially Higher and Higher, the bulk of which this book borrows from, but note that this is called a ""companion"" book. Edward Wincentsen makes this point very clear in his forward and stresses himself that a really good and more in depth book about the band needs to be written. I read on Justin Hayward's website that he won't be the one to do it, and he doubts that anybody else in the band will either, because the Moodies are friendly but very private people and there's enough out there that they don't feel compelled to write. In other words, we may get somebody's unauthorized account down the line. There are some nice photos in this book, but aside from that, there's little knowledge to be gained unless you just took an interest in the band. Yes, we do need a better book about the band but, for now, the Companion is better than nothing."
3,Ok but we need so much more...,"I am a big Moody Blues fan and was glad to get this book. I would have to agree wtih what others has writen. It does not have that much information in it. Spends too much time talking about aging boomer women meeting the band. Although it did provide me with some information on where I could find a few rare Moodies tracks. We need a much better definative account of this great band. Also it is time to get this band in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The rock hall is a joke because of its snub to the Moodies,ans Yes."
5,excellent,It's anecdotal and musical.This band puts so much heart in these songs.This CD is terrific!
5,great cd,"I was a fan of George Lynch since I heard the band Dokken.When they split George formed Lynch Mob. This is the 2nd release from the band.I love this style of music. I would describe it as , Hard rock with some Blues.Really great Guitar work along with Good Vocals and solid Bass & Drums.I already had the orignal release from the U.S but there are 2 songs on this Import versionthat I liked and couldn't get elsewhere.This is one of those CD's I wouldn't want to be without.If you like Dokken or Badlands or Tesla, Ect. This is a must."
4,Great phone for the patient.,"I've had this phone for about a week now and really love it. I was looking for a phone with everything and this one had it: long range, nice looks worthy of an office (I was sick of phones that looked like video games), clear connections, long battery life on the cordless handset, great speakerphone, voicemail with multiple boxes, caller-id, 2-lines, reasonable price... the list goes on and on.Then there's the catch. There is always a catch. It's almost impossible to figure everything out without reading the manual.If you're willing to spend some time sitting down to set everything up, this is the phone for you. If you're impatient and get easily upset when you change your voicemail message while you're trying to turn down the volume you'll probably throw the phone out the window."
1,Cannot survive power surges,"I bought my 8825 about 18 months ago. It has worked well in that time, except that it cannot survive power surges. About 8 months ago, there was a power surge in my house that damanged the base unit. The problem was that line 1 of the base unit would go off hook, and stay off hook. I got around this by using only line 2. A few days ago, another surge, and line 2 now shows the same symptoms. I have many other pieces of equipment in my house that interface to phone lines, and none of these were taken out. I will sell my cordless handsets on eBay, and I will look for a new system from another manufacturer."
1,Believe all the negative comments on Siemens Phones,"I have owned two complete Siemens Gigaset telephone systems, with bases and 5 remote handsets. The feature set and designed operation is excellent, especially for a home based business or small office. But it will all fail within a couple of years. When it happened the first time I thought it was a fluke, so I replaced everything, with the saem results. LCD displays fail, charging stands fail, handsets fail, sound quality drops to zero. If anyone knows of a quality replacement (Panasonic?) please post your thoughts, but I will stay a long way from Siemens products in the future."
1,Consumer beware,"In the summer of 2001 I purchased a Siemens 2420 desk station and handset, similar to the Model 8825, that had an LCD panel on the base to begin failing shortly after the warranty expired. Slowly the panel deteriorated to an unreadable level. After several calls to Siemens customer service I was advised that: it was a hardware problem; that the telephone was out of warranty and also out of production; that it could not be repaired, even at my expense; and although it was a ($$$) purchase lasting only 26 months, my only option to was to throw it away and buy another telephone. This is a big corporation the little guy would do well to avoid."
2,Siemens expandable cordless phone system is lousy!,"I purchased the Siemens base staton and 4 handset units. Within 3 months, two of the handsets were unusable (battery stopped charging and the other unit had too much static). The ones that are still usable are lously at best. Scratchy sound, and voices fade in and out. The bright side to this sad report is that the base station is great! It is easy to configure and works very well in all aspects. Do not buy this system if you intend to expand it by using additional handsets!"
4,Siemens 8825 2 line phone lacks individual ringer controls,"The product works as expected, BUT, in contrast to all other two line phones I have seen ...,this one ....does not include ringer controls for each line. It is impossible to turn one line off. Of course I didn't find this out until after I bought it, and, of course, this was one of the main features I wanted.I am replacing it as soon as I can."
2,Great base station; Poor sound quality,"Feature-wise, this phone was perfect for me. The quality of the base station seemed very solid, right down to the push buttons and overall aesthetics. However, the handset was very noisy w/intermittent squawks even without the microwave running. When the microwave was on, forget it. I really wanted to like this phone, but audio quality is paramount. It misses badly on what should be its best attribute. I returned it."
1,Expensive But Horrible Quality - Beware!,"I thought since this was a German product it would be smart and high quality but if Siemen's made cars they would Chrysler K-cars or Yugos at best - NOT BMW's. Aside from the completely unintuitive interface my base station display began to systematically disappear, until now, where I find myself two years down the road shopping for a new phone system because the display only has about 5 working pixels which means I can't change the message since I can't navigate the stupid menus. Yesterday it quit ringing which is sort of the icing on a very stale cake.If you buy this phone you will be sadly disappointed in time - there's no way this company is German..."
2,Don't try the 8825 with 2 base stations,"Okay phone as a stand-alone unit. However, avoid multiple base stations.I purchased two base stations and an extra (third) cordless handset thinking that my home offices could also use these systems as an intercom. No so, each cordless unit can only register to one base station at at time. That means that the other base station will not be able to intercom a cordless handset that is not registered to it. Sound confusing? Maybe a little. The short of it is that I have 2 base stations and 3 cordless handsets and I cannot intercom completely between them.Otherwise, the system is okay. The cordless unit has a built in speakerphone, which is nice."
1,Utter crap!,"We have the base speakerphone as the ONLY working phone in the house. NONE of the other four handsets work; they all clunked at about a year after purchase at the same time. We have a large home and initially these phones were perfect for us, but we expected more longevity, especially after paying a small fortune. Our phone co. stopped selling them due to complaints, and everyone we know that has them had problems. Great concept,inferior product."
5,Outside looking in,"This phone is amazing. It does everything you could want and more. The telephone, digital answering machine, a Caller ID (which the phone will tell you who is calling), 120 speed-dial presets. It's got call transfer and intercom which comes in handy. If you need a phone that does it all this is the one. It's got 4 mail boxes which is really nice living in a busy house like I do. Each person gets their own mail box. This phone does to much to talk about. You won't regret buying this phone. It's the only one you need. It was cool.Big Truck"
1,Don't waste your time or your money,"After using this phone system in a business for well over a year, I am sorry on a daily basis that I ever purchased it. The long and short of it:The worst interface I have ever seen on a phone. I have hung up on 4 times as many people as I have ever succesfully put on hold.The worst battery life I have ever seen in a cordless phone. Don't bother replacing the batteries, as it won't help. I have multiple independently-purchased handsets, and they all have the same issue.Reception and sound quality are mediocre in general, but are extremely deleteriously affected by wifi networks and microwave ovens...basically anything putting out microwave radiation in a similar frequency.It looks like a great set of features, but the phone will make you sorry you ever bought it the longer you have to put up with all of it's unfortunate idiosyncrasies."
1,Stay Away,"I purhased three sets and three handsets for our new home because i needed the two line capacity. The result? A bust at best! The reception for the cordless phone is very poor. The engineering is poor, for example, you cannot get into line two from the cordless phone. If you are looking for a 2 line cordless phone that works - stay away. The Vtech was a winner hands down - less money and works better!"
1,Siemens Gigaset 8825,"- Phone & its handsets are mediocre at best.- Siemens support not very forthcoming/helpful.- Design & features not well or professionally thought out.- No battery backup for date / time. Any power loss requires resetting;- Speakerphone on handset, but does not 'mute';- Controls not easy to use;- Phone's number listing not easy to enter or maintain.At first glance this unit appeared promising. I am very disappointed, with the telephone, the headset(s), and Siemens. I have found a replacement system, which will cost less, and do more. I will never by a Siemens product again."
1,Siemens 8825 - Poor Quality,"I have purchased 3 sets, yes, THREE! Two of which I had to return because both units were defective.The first return was the result of the all of the answering machine buttons flashing continuously without any messages. The second return was for a defective handset that refused to register with the base station.The handset has very poor standby time and no mute. Programming the phone was arduous. Although after programming the directory, sending the directory to the handset was a cinch. Do not purchase this phone if you want to share other wireless transmitters in the same environment. This phone creates an incredible amount of interference.I did decide to keep the third set to test long term but I sincerely think that this last set will complete its warranty period."
1,"Very poorly made, It WILL break","I purchased this phone hoping to be able to add phones to bedrooms without having to install jacks into each wall. This phone worked for about 3 - 4 days. The handsets were always unstable, dropping signals and hanging up on callers every now and then, but the entire thing just stopped working within a week of owning it. When I started to research the phone, I found a lot of compalints. Don't be fooled by the false promise of this product. Go with a better name model like the AT&T. GE or Panasonic."
1,Siemens - Do you even care ?,"Had a Gigaset 2420 - very expensive, worked great for about 2 yrs - then like everyone else that bought one experienced bad display and warbling when on calls. Looked for replacements and found the Gigaset 8825 had the best feature set for the money - bought into Siemens again for even more $$$$ The phone out of the box had clicks and pops in the cordless conversations - then lately ( 1.5 yrs old ) the caller ID on line one no longer works. Sad - Very Sad I have to see if I bought this on one of those credit cards that automatically extends wty - Siemens does not want anything to do with it - their 800# support only helps their newest prey - the tech I reached on their toll # only said the phone was shot and bring it to a service center. Collectively people have lost a lot of money to this company. I for one will not buy any Siemens product again - ever."
1,Skip this phone,"The AC adapter for my phone just died so I call the phone number they plaster on the phone and on every manual. The recording says to email them or goto their website and then it hangs up. Why even give a phone number? I email them as instructed and the email comes back as not working. So I am still trying to figure out how to make a warranty claim.With that said, like many others I hear an annoying clicking on the portable phone as well. Also the controls are not very intuitive. You will have to use the manual repeatedly.On the good side it is an attractive design and the portable phone battery lasts for a long period of time."
1,poor workmanship,"After only a year, the LCD display didn't work properly. More and more segments of the display faded away. The maximum range of the wireless handsets is far inferior to another cordless phone from Uniden which I also own. I would advise everyone to avoid Siemens cordless phones."
4,excellent product,Great product. A tad complicated to set up and get the system going. Excellent sound quality and answering system. Works well in our large duplex condo. Good value and investment.
2,Bad Corded Handset,"I purchased the 8825 as a replacement for the previous model, primarily because it has a better cordless handset, with speakerphone (something i wanted). Everything is ok, with the exception of the recorded voice quality and the corded handset. While using the corded handset, I hear a loud buzzing if about 1-2 feet away from, and in line with, the antenna. I have diagnosed the problem to a badly shielded handset. If you hold the handset near the antenna, with either the corded end, or the back, of the handset next to the antenna, i hear the buzzing...strongest at the middle. I called Siemens, and they said it was a bad cord...not so. I also tried a toroid on the cord, to no avail. This is a disappointment, since the previous version has better sound, and no buzz problem. None of these multi handset systems are perfect. I looked at the Panasonic kxtg2000b, but no mute on the base or handset, and more complicated to use. Really disappointed in this product."
1,Destruction of the phone by power outages,I had the previous line of phones and paid hundreds of dollars for it only to find that a power outage destroyed line 1. Siemens wouldn't fix it and essentially told me I was out of luck. I swore never to buy another Siemen's product. I was curious about the new generation phones and I see that they still have the identical problem. It doesn't surprise me. They showed zero interest when I reported the problem so how could they redesign the next generation of phones to deal with it.
1,What a disappointment the Siemans 8825 was!,"I purchased this phone system in May, 2003. (Spent about $350.00, incl. a 2nd handset.) During the past year I was without the phone for a month while waiting for the base unit to be repaired (by Siemans). After a power outage in June, 2004 Line 1 no longer worked (a busy signal if you called it). After troubleshooting it with their ""Tech Support"", I was told that I have to take it to an electronics repair store. Siemans will not repair it - even at my expense. The base unit is just too prone to problems. I definitely will not purchase another Siemans telephone system."
1,Lack of Support,"If you'd asked me a year ago I would have said that I loved this system. But now, the displays on three of my handsets are blown and the base station dropped one of the two lines. Siemens is no help at all. Their only advice was to buy another system. Fat chance! This would be terriffic if it actually worked."
1,A total piece of junk,All the issues have been mentioned. I too have the clicking and garbled sounds on the handset. This product self destructs and the refurbished trash they send you is just as bad. What's most annoying is that I recommended this system to a friend because it worked fine for a while but his system has turned to junk as well. I know Siemens products from Germany and can't believe they would sell this junk in the US.
1,Run away from any Siemens product,"I bought a Siemans 2420 for my home office. In two months there was a thunderstorm and it ddn't survive a power surge. The second unit was replaced by my company. From day one it clicked very loudly. People on the other end would ask ""what is that clicking noise?"" I would respond ""it's my very expensive Siemen's phone."" Then the battery would drain quickly on the handsets after I had the unit for 8 months. After reading these reviews, I'm not going to bother with Siemens customer service."
2,spare yourself,"As a phone and cordless system it's pretty good. But like the others have noted, the LCD display is unreadable on the base unit after awhile. So it's a very expensive grey paperweight with a very short cord, unless you don't need a display. If you do, it's around another $100 to repair the display + all the hassles that go with it. It is also very complicated to use as a phone system. There is no customer service. So, spare yourself."
1,Class action lawsuit,"Maybe what Siemens needs is a class action lawsuit. I also owned an 8825, same bad experience as shared by other owners."
1,Do not buy Siemens Gigaset at any price,"From my experience, Siemens never repaired the issues form their first miserable attempt at creating a consumer/home office phone line of business. I made this mistake of forgiving them on the first iteration, only to see the same problems on the second. If you have the same experience as I, you'll begin to see the LCD fade after a year, maybe two. The handsets deteriorate in short order as well. For me, attempts to contact Siemens result in an offer from them to sell me reconditioned components, or no return e-mail at all.If you buy this you will be: wasting your money, rewarding gross incompetence, become as frustrated as I."
1,No Customer Support to Speak Of,"I purchased the 8825 approx 18 months ago. As of yesterday, the wireless transmitter on the base station no longer functions correctly. I called Siemens customer support and they verified that my base station wireless transmitter is no longer functioning correctly. They then went on to inform me that since the phone is older than 12 months old my only recourse is to replace the base station (@ $250) this seems hardly an acceptable solution. Their rather curt support associate tells me they have no support for the system once the 1 year warranty expires (not even a pay for repair service).Take my advice, stay away from Siemens!"
1,Stay away from Siemens phones!,"Pros: Specifications look good on paper. Phone made neat crackling sounds as I used it for target practice with my shotgun.Cons: Everything else.This system reminds me of Paris Hilton - nice package that works out great for a while, but sooner or later you discover there is little merit to this overpriced, high-maintenance, fragile and fickle unit.Customer service is basically from the ""we-already-made-our-money-and-we-don't-repair-them-so-screw-you"" school of thought. Unfortunately, I bought 2 of them with 4 remotes. Both base stations have failed - so I guess I'm stuck.I wonder if the remotes would fit in my clay pidgeon launcher..."
1,"Great concept, poor quality","I owned 3 Siemens multi-handset system (8825) phones so far. The first one had a failure in the digital display when it was first opened. I exchaned that phone and got a new one. The second one was good for approximately 2 years and the reception on the handsets started to deteriorate and the speaker phone was no longer working.I like the simple design and easy to use features (once you learn how to operate it). In concept, it is perfect for home based businesses! So I decided to still get the third one. I had it for two years now and the speaker phone reception is so poor that I no longer use it, the remote handset had to be unplugged because it was beeping without reason. I'm so disappointed with Siemens.I wish that there was another phone on the market that provided the same great features, had a simple design, and was of great quality, unfortunately the combination is impossible to find."
1,Beware lack of support from Siemens,"Beware Siemens lack of support. I owned the previous system, the 2420, bought a short 3 years ago. While it is understandable that products come and go, that Siemens offers absolutely no service for this product is unconsionable given the price of the system..."
3,"Great System, but a couple of fatal flaws","Great system but for a couple of fatal flaws. For some inexplicable reason, the handsets lack a MUTE function, making them virtually useless for participating in conference calls. Also, despite having a speakerphone in the handset, the system does not have the ability to page through the handsets.Since the hardware clearly supports it, it would be nice if Siemens gave the capability to hands-free intercom a handset. The exclusion of a mute feature is unforgiven."
1,Looks good on paper....but no delivery!,"Great concept. Lousy delivery. Anytime I get anywhere near my wireless cable modem the cordless handsets snap, crackle & pop -- they are truly awful. It's in the design because these are the second set of handsets I've used. Siemens replaced the first ones but these still don't work well. Stay away if you've got any other wireless action going on at your house/office."
1,Cool idea...bad implementation,"If the answering machine responds to a phone call before you do (even by a second), you can't answer it with the handset. There is no capability for this handset to interupt a line that has already been answered. You also can't transfer a call from the handset. There are no buttons to even attempt this. All such operations are only available from the base station unit.If you try to answer a call by picking the handset up out of the cradle...it hangs up on the call roughly 50% of the time. Then, within months, several handset buttons started failing.I loose 10%-15% of my calls due to these missing features and malfunctions. If you buy this phone, you'll love it for days ... then hate it for months. After a year, expect to break it in a fit of rage."
1,Siemens not to be trusted,"I have a Siemens 2420 system with 8 handsets. I have sent several in for repair with not much improvement. The handsets constantly drop out in the middle of conversations. The noise in the earpiece is terrible and the person on the other end of the line cannot hear you. I emailed Siemens about this and they admitted that they had a problem with the handsets' shielding which caused the dropouts. I then asked if I could get some kind of credit towards their new model since I had spent a small fortune buying the base and all the handsets for teh 2420, but they would not do that. Why would I trust them with this new system when they will not support the old one. At least they should have redesigned the handsets so that we could use the system. I am stuck trying to decide what to replace my 2420 with. The one thing that the Siemens has going for it is the features. Unfortunately, if you cant use the phone, they are useless."
1,This system is junk,"This is my second time around with Siemens. I had the earlier model that clicked its way to the garbage heap, and the new, improved 8825 is not far behind. The handset clicks at least half the time it's in use.Siemens customer service says that phone companies are getting away from the 2.4 ghz protocol because of interference with wireless networks. Nice of them to tell us at the time of purchase. They kindly offered to replace the handset and base station if I would return my system first. So I would be without my two line phone system for 10-14 days. This policy is in keeping with the junkiness of the product. Stay away from the 8825 if you value your mental health."
1,Poor reception/coverage,"I was very dissapointed with the Gigaset 8825. After using a 900MHz single-line phone for several months, I decided to migrate to a 2-line 2GHz. I was expecting a better reception, and at least the same as with the 900MHz single-line phone. But a stacatto reception on the handset dissapointed me. I am returning it."
2,Nice-good features but NOT built to last...,"I have had this phone for approximately 1.5 years now. The base works pretty good with the corded handset, however, the handsets (I have two) are not worth a plugged nickel! I have replaced the batteries in both handsets and they still do not function properly. The big problem is they lose the sound coming in -- but reception is strong. Go figure..."
5,An impressive range of moods and subjects,"The first track of this album (""Tommyknockers"") is an ominous mining song that wouldn't be out of place in the movie based on Stephen King's novel of the same name. The title track is an evocative portrait of a primeval wilderness, and the final track (""Google Me Gently"" is a light-hearted ditty about trying to avoid personal responsibility in the Internet Age. Name a mood and a subject, and I'll bet Jim Pipkin could write a song to perfectly express it. Furthermore, he has one of the most mellow voices to be heard anywhere."
1,Great American Soldier -- Cumbersome Biography,"This comprehensive biography of one of America's great soldiers traces Pershing's life from his middle class upbringing in rural Missouri, to West Point, to the Western frontier during the final years of the Indian wars, to the Philippines, to the Punitive Expedition to Mexico and finally to France and the command of the American Expeditionary Force. Pershing's no-nonsense personality and his insistence on discipline and training is evident throughout. But the author has difficulty achieving any balance in his reporting. A sentence suffices to explain the treaty terms with Germany at the conclusion of WWI, but endless pages describe medal ceremonies and the atmospherics of military conferences. The lengthy work is replete with platitudes, cliches and vague characterizations. It quickly becomes tiresome. Find another biography of this great American."
1,Not What I Expected,This is a marketing presentation that I paid for - what a disappointment. No worthy information on visual factory mgmt provided.
4,amazing,this movie is absolutley amazing i mean that is a real actress. she plaid that movie with such passion it was truly perfection.
5,A True Classic,"Joanne Woodward is terrific and pulls you into her frightening world and the loss of control. It isn't a ""fun"" movie, but I very much enjoyed it."
5,I WAS FORCED TO WATCH IT...I LOVE IT!,"This was an awsome movie! It was so interesting, yet weird at the same time. In class, my teacher made us watch it, then I got caught up in it! It is so neat!"
5,Black and White but very good,"Film about a real case of multiple pernsoality. I had to think many days about this film, after watching it, so to me its a great movie.DVD is in good quality."
2,Beautifully Unconvincing,"This was not a very bad movie, however an honest Hollywood mistake. Joanne Woodward gives a shaky performance unworthy of an Oscar. This motion picture looked too unreal and the plot was like a fictional comedy to me instead of a tearjerker. To this day, directors still have not learned that there are some subjects you don't make films on, like this very private matter of a woman with multiple personalities. This was my first Joanne Woodward film I've seen; winning shamefully the Academy Award for Best Actress. This film just drags on and on with no real inciteful meaning. Take it from a guy who knows a thing or two about films: DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!"
3,Blackouts are her friend.,The Three Faces of Eve starring Joanne Woodward has to be her best role to date. Woodward is captivating as Eve who suffers from multiple personalities. The ending is kind of corny and over-hyped so that is why I am not giving this film a perfect rating. Just watch it for Joanne's memorable performance.
4,Really Good.,I'm not the type who will sit through a black and white movie but once I heard that this was a true story I decided to purchase it. It was really good and really well acted. Joanne Woodward did a wonderful job in the transitions between personalities.
4,big d,"Joanne Woodword is anh excellent actress. She had a great performance of Eve White, and the two other personalitues. Lee J. Cobb is a great actor, and also had a great performance as the Doctor"
3,An Actress' Dream Role,"Joanne Woodward gets one of those roles that most actresses must dream about - the opportunity to play a character with three distinct personalities. The film centres on this woman's attempt to regain her life with the assistance of a psychiatrist played by Lee J. Cobb. Woodward does a very good job of creating various personalities and balancing the role. I wish I knew more about multiple personalities and psychiatry to know how accurate the film is, because I found parts of it hard to believe. The way the hypnosis is presented seems to me to be far too easy and simple, and to be honest, we don't actually get to see very much of how the doctor helped the young woman. If you look to the film less as a case study and more as a piece of drama, you will find much to enjoy about it. And regardless of how factual and accurate it is, The Three Faces of Eve was an important step in presenting mental illness to the public, and for that reason also, it deserves to be seen."
4,"Good Movie, but...","If you really want to learn about ""Eve"" you should read the book she co-wrote entitled ""I'm Eve"" that was written after many more years of trauma. Yes, the movie is well done, but not complete and according to the real ""Eve"", Chris Costner-Sizemore, not true to her life experiences. She particularly refutes the blame placed on her parents who she considers not perfect, but loving and generous. Also, unlike the movie implies, she is not cured for another 15 years. So, after you see the movie, if you're interested in learning more, I highly recommend the book!"
4,"For the price, these can't be beat!!","I purchased the PDWM3000 system last year when I needed a couple of wireless mics NOW!. I didn't have time to look around and test a bunch of equipment as I had visiting musicians performing at numerous venues and ran out of equipment. They work great !!!! I have used them in my own performances for vocals as well as milking acoustic instruments. I have not had one bit of trouble with them at all. AS far as some of the other reviews, I would suggest that you kindly use spell check and/or proper vocabulary when describing this product. It tends to lend very little to your opinion when you are unable to properly verbalize your thoughts..."
3,Ok product.,The shipping was fast. The mics work well at times but sometimes 1 wont pick up voices at all when they are both on.
1,Don't buy this product,"Dear Amazon Customers, please be carefully with this product and don't buy this wireless microphones.I purchased this in March 18, 2010.When I opened the box, it's looks that everything was OK with products BUT the microphones does not work.I try to use this with 2 home karaoke system but it does not work. The quality of sound is very low, you can't hear anything. I'll never buy anything from this company again.I cant understand how people can rate this product with 4 star.Please, don't buy this product."
4,Recieved in a quick Manner as Needed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Easy Set up, Quickly Delivered, And Sounded Great for the First Use so Far! I would Highly recommend these Mic's! Only thing is Make sure You Screw in the Antenna in the right Microphone, if it doesnt screw in to One then it goes in the other Microphone! Thank's Guy's and Gal's! Great Product!"
4,Wireless Microphones (Pyle),"Excellent product; looked around and SINGLE microphone was twice as expensive. This dual microphone works excellent and has good range (at least 100 feet); there was some distortion, but it is expected in range of speaker outputs. Vendor was prompt, questions were answered accurately, and price was excellent."
1,"A pyle of ""you know what""","On paper it looks amazing. The sound quality however, is horrible. It's well worth paying a bit more for a decent product."
2,Did not last long.,In just two shows antennas to microphones broke and batteries did not last long went dead after first set. Product needs better antennas.
1,PYLE-PRO PDWM3000 - Dual VHF Rechargeable Wireless Microphone System,one of the micro (green one) not working. I send a claim to Amazon and ofice and no answer. Until now ican notwork with this product and it seems nobody want to explainme what can i do
2,problem,I am having trouble with the mics I got. One of them just doesn't want to work. I was sent a new mic but it is doing the same thing. I have called QualityCarAudio and left messages but have not recieved an answer. Spent 30 min on the phone trying to get someone but gave up.
1,Pyle Por PDWM3000 - not good out of the box,Supplied antenna does not screw in (wrong part) unit also generates hum in my system. Ready to rock only to do first gig with them under the table while my old faithful wired mics did the dirty work.
1,Buy a different set,Dont waste your time or money on this set. The first unit I received was defective out of the box. I returned that set and got a replacement set(Amazon return policy is excellent and easy to use!) and it too was defective right out of the box. The microphones are cheaply made. I returned this set and am going to order a different brand.
5,Kentucky Derby Party hit!,"I used this pan for our Kentucky Derby party. I used to make ""ice sculptures."" It worked great, just poured water in and froze it, then used a plate holder inside a large bowl with a little water, floated roses in the bowl and placed the ice horseshoe in the plate holder. They were quite a hit as my centerpieces! I will be using this in the years to come as well! Fun little product!"
1,flimsy pan,"I really wanted to like this pan. It was broken when it came in. It is thin plastic, and I didn't even bother to send it back. When I saw how easily it was broken, although carefully packed, I realized it probably was not something I wanted."
1,"Not sure what to do with this, can't bake a cake in it.....","I purchased this cake pan with the big question as to how do they make a ""plastic"" cake pan. I wondered if it was something more modern than I have ever used such as those silicone baking pans. Ordered it anyways and if you are planning on baking a cake do not order this pan. You cannot bake in it and just so I could say this and know it to be true, I put it in the oven and melted it within minutes. How on earth can anyone call a ""cake pan"" something you cannot bake in is beyond me. I'm thinking generation gap, but I would never recommend this item."
4,Jake's 2nd Birthday Bus Cake,"This bus pan holds exactly 6-cups of liquid; I made a homemade glazed lemon loaf-sized pound cake and the recipe filled the pan perfectly. I baked the cake at 350F for 35 minutes. The wheels of the bus, and the stop sign were somewhat scorched! USE CAUTION if you bake in this pan at a temperature above 350F.CK Products School Bus Pantastic Plastic Cake Pan"
4,Good cake pan,I bought this cake pan for my daughter who loves cows. It wasn't all that hard to make it and decorate it. Cheap and easy! It can't get better than that.
5,Best tennis shoe ever,I'm on my third set of Ultrascendors because I haven't found a better tennis shoe. These are so well designed and and comfortable right out of the box. These are already a classic IMHO.
5,Most comfortable tennis shoe I've owned,"The K-Swiss Ultrascendor is the most comfortable pair of tennis shoes I've owned yet. There are no painful spots, the toe box is plenty wide, and the leather is very flexible. The lining around the ankle area is also very comfortable, and the opening is wide enough that they slip on/off easily without untying. I use these for tennis, other sports, and also as everyday shoes."
5,"Excellent playability, about average durability","Best tennis shoe available for that low price IMO. Well cushioned and light. Performs well on clay (when new), carpet and hardcourt. Sole durability of average standard...note that there are two variants of the UltrAscendor, this review is for the standard (""low"") version..."
5,Ultimate Luxury,"I work high season at an exclusive island resort spa in the Florida Keys, and we use the Pure Figi products there for our ultimate signature pedicures. I have been in the nail and hair profession for 30 years and this is without a doubt the finest pedicure scrub I have ever used. Love it!"
3,Good bushings but needed modification,The holes for the bolts that secure the engine mount to the cross member were not big enough to fit the factory bolts through. I had to drill out the holes in order for them to line up with the receiving holes and to allow the mounting bolts to pass through.
4,warness did its job,"i have a 04 element. the wiring harness did its job. it was a tough install you had to take most of the rear of the car apart to get at the harness. i ended up snaking the harness through the rear tail light to the hitch, but that is honda fault. The harness works fine, i gave it 4 stars since it did not included its own installation instructions i pulled them off another website for a different harness."
4,Cheap source for dove bwash,"I'd rate it 5 stars for value but they sent a different scent than the picture...however, we like it."
4,"Good little movie, entertaining cast of Metalheads","This is a good documentary of the origins and the development of what has become to be known as heavy metal. This has a ton of first hand interviews with Geezer Butler, Dave Mustaine, Dio, Steven Pearcy, Dee Snyder, Scott Ian and others... The list goes on. They tell some of their stories, confirm some of the legends, and give thier opinions on why Metal is here, and why it's going to stay. This does not give a great timeline, nor a history of Metal, just a rough family tree, but not as much of an in depth look at the different genres like ""metal: a headbangers journey"". Between this film and ""Metal"", rock fans can become enlightened about their music they are listening too. Worth a rent or a buy."
3,A panoramic view,"The central purpose of the film is to set up a panoramic view of the heavy metal scene from its begining with Black Sabbath to recent efforts such as Korn and Slipknot. In this way, the documentary fullfills its objective. Well informed, with key commentors such as Dee Snyder and Jonhattan Davis, and enough examples of the sounds they're talking about. Perhaps the only fault (but this is something common in this kind of TV oriented pieces) is the lack of analysis of the Extreme Heavy Metal Movement around the world. But, if you're looking for some informed entertainment the picture is quite good."
3,"More music, please.","Rock anthology is of a great historic value for, especially, a volume of not-so-often-aired recording provided, although tunes might be longer as commentaries shorter for better appreciating of this comprehensive three-hours-something work."
5,unbreakable belts,"glad I put new belts before the nieces and nephews came for vacation,had no idea that lawn tractor would be used as a go cart,hay ride puller,etc..I think it was the highlight of their vacation Lol"
2,Wrong time zone,"WILL NOT pick up central time no matter how many times I reset it. Always 2 hours behind. Other then that problem, it keeps time and the rest seem to work fine. And the engine sound will definitely shock you awake."
2,worst customer service,"This is a nice product for every Ferrari fan. It's still a little complicated to use = would be nice to have a simple ""Alarm ON/OFF switch""Still my husband liked it a lot.BUT... unfortunately the tiny plastic cover that holds the batteries in broke. Without this little piece of plastic the batteries won't stay in.After contacting the manufacturer I just got the simple answer:""..We are sorry to hear that you are having issues with your Oregon Scientific product.We apologize but the battery cover is not sold separately. Please be advised that we don't sell parts and we don't have repair sites for our units.Hope this information helps....""No, it did not help at all, so I wrote back asking very politely why it is too difficult to sell a little piece of plastic to a customer.They never got back to me.I definitely cannot recommend buying Oregon Scientific products!"
2,"Nice combo, but didn't last","It lasted a month, until it fell off a low table and the battery compartment door broke. There're two tiny little pieces that holds the door in. One of them broke off when the clock fell, which rendered the unit unusable, because it was the only thing keeping the door in, thus keeping the batteries in. The clock looked great and we were very happy with it. But the design is flawed when it comes to the battery compartment. Now it's just a box and useless."
5,AWESOME VIDEO!!,"YOU GOTTA HAVE THIS ONE!! WHOEVER WROTE A BAD REVIEW IS MOST DEFENITELY A COMPETITOR, WHO HAS MADE A SIMILAR VIDEO THAT ISN'T EVEN CLOSE TO HOW WELL THIS ONE IS!! I'VE BEEN IN THE MARINE CORPS FOR 15 YEARS, AND HAVE MANY FAMILY MEMBERS IN IT TOO. IF THERE IS A SINGLE VIDEO THAT WILL TELL YOU ABOUT IT ALL, THIS IS IT!!"
5,GOT TO HAVE IT!,This video is truly one of a kind. It is awesome! I highly recommend it to any Force Recon enthusiast! The footage is unbelievable...
1,They're not,"<<Overall, great video. Gives you a glimpse of what Force Recon is all about. Not too many know about them, but they're just as equal/similar as Navy SEALs, and other ""Special Operations"".>>Marine Recon is not equalled to Navy Seal or the other Special Operations Forces. Force Recon is the equivalent of the U.S Army Ranger. They both do the same types of missions. In fact, volunteers for Force Recon have to go to Ranger School. Fprce Recon does not operate like US Army Special Force, Navy Seal, Air Force PRJ, or Delta."
5,Great book for both boys and girls,"Would a 4 year old girl who's totally into the Disney Princesses like a book about pirates? It turns out that this book is not exactly about pirates, but about a little boy and his imagination. My 4 year old niece loves the book, so don't think it's just for boys!"
2,Great illustrations but a little boring,"My 3 and a half year old loves anything about pirates but I am afraid he finds Edward and the Pirates a bit boring. It was reccomended to me in the book store,the illustrations are quite lovely,and the idea is good but if you are looking for the excitement you might expect with pirates you might look elsewhere matey. Unfortunately it sits on the bookshelf rarely chosen for the night night story."
4,Protect the Library Book!,"Edward is a little boy with a fantastic imagination. When he reads a book, he becomes a part of the story, which is fine when he's reading about Joan of Arc and Robin Hood, but it becomes a bit of a problem when pirates are involved. The pirates want Edward's book because they're convinced it will show them where they buried their treasure, but Edward can't let them have it: it's a library book. I loved the story in this book, but I am not a huge fan of the illustrations. They are dark and blurry, and I don't think they made the greatest impact with the kids during story time. However, I think the storyline is wonderful. Every kid should be encouraged to have an imagination like Edward!"
2,A little beat up,This product was a little more beat up looking then I was led to believe. The cover itselt was creased at the corners and certainly more used looking than I had hoped. The book itself is delightful to read - but I cannot give as a gift in this condition.
4,People are complicated,Everyone in City Island has a secret. You will care about the characters more and more as each layer of the onion is peeled back. You will not find them on your own.
2,Would not play in BLU ray player,I just got this movie on blu ray but it would not play in my Sony PS3 player...said something about a BD Live? I guess issue and that i needed a software update...I think this is what this issue was also w AVATAR! Man...so hard to keep up w technology these days and thank god I have a router even though its taking more than 3 hours to do the update!BTW>..the movie is freaking awsome...saw it in the theatre and had to get it right away! One of the funniest and original movies I have seen in years...ENJOY!
3,Slow Start to a Dramatic Ending,"It's nice to see Andy Garcia again, even in this modest effort of a New York family who has secrets all to be revealed in due time. Generally, I found the film slow and even at times boring. But it did not catch my attention until about the final 30 minutes. I wont reveal anything here, but I found it got intense and dramatic.Would I recommend this? I think for some people who like to get a taste of New York culture outside of popular Manhattan, its not a bad film. For me, I found it mediocre and easily forgettable. If time is something of a concern and you have to be choosy about the movies you want to see, there are much better films out there."
3,FUN TO WATCH BUT GLAD WE DIDN'T BUY TICKETS,"There's a saying at our house that just sort of evolved. After watching a movie at home, one of us may say, ""Well, I enjoyed that, but sure am glad we didn't buy tickets."" It's just that for us some movies are worth the high prices now charged at theatres and some aren't.For us, CITY ISLAND falls into the latter category. It was fun to watch, and we're glad we did but really didn't see anything THAT special about it. The acting was excellent, but perhaps we've become a bit jaded re dysfunctional family films.Andy Garcia is one of our favorites, and he did his usual stellar job. It was of special interest to see Julianna Margulies in this role (almost the antithesis of her Good Wife character seen on TV.If this were a report card, we'd give it a C+."
5,city island is one great movie :),"this was such an enjoyable, funny movie...i laughed out loud more than once! the cast, the writing, the storyline..all excellent!"
5,A Rare Find,"Chose this film because I once lived on City Island. But I was unprepared for how good it was. It's a rare combination of characterization, plot tensions, and great acting that creates what reviewers call a ""touching, yet feel-good"" movie. Only, in my opinion, this really is one."
5,"Complex tale, well-crafted","This hilarious film deals with many contrasts between public and private selves, shame and deception. Some of the best mealtime squabbles ever filmed feature superb acting. The plot threads come together beautifully at the climax."
5,Great movie!,"Great movie. I don't even know how I heard of it but there wasn't much hype for it at all. I've watched it 3 or 4 times now. It's about a very disfunctional family, but they care about each other. It all comes together in the end. Certainly a feel good flick. It was also educational--I'd never heard of City Island, Bronx, New York....now I have."
3,Dysfunction rules on City Island,"It's almost unfair to try and explain the plot of City Island because it would spoil the fun of watching it unfold in front of you. It's not really that original a story, mind you, but the way the talented cast brings it to life is inspired enough to make any predictability forgivable.[...]"
3,Oh Andy. You could've done better,I bought this movie because I love Andy Garcia. I think he keeps playing the same kind of character. Movie was ok. The movie was delivered quickly and undamaged.
3,it was ok... but the whole overweight eating fettish was kinda gross,It was an ok movie but the whole overweight eating fettish was kind of gross honestly and to be honest most of the action and events dont happen till towards the end of the movie but i thought overall it was not a bad movie though def not a movie for kids to see ...at all. but not a bad watch for 5 bucks its not a bad buy either but i woudnt have paid 20 bucks for it. id say its a movie mostly to rent then to own.
4,Secrets and Lies in the Bronx,"A wonderfully offbeat comedy-drama, ""City Island"" (2009) features a memorable ensemble cast in top form. There are more genuine laughs than a slew of glorified Hollywood sitcoms. Kudos to writer-director Raymond De Felitta for this quirky look at familial dysfunction. Andy Garcia's audition scene is worth the price of admission."
3,"Off the wall film, may not be everyone's cup of tea","If you are in the right mood, and are looking for this type of film -- a quirky and somewhat off-the-wall comedy about a dysfunctional family -- then you may enjoy this film quite a bit, but I'm not so certain this is a film with wide appeal, which probably explains how it pretty much lingered on a DVD that had sat on my ""to be watched"" shelf for quite a while, and even more so, explains how it was basically a straight to DVD release rather than anything I recall any buzz about in theatrical release. (Actually it does strike me as the kind of film that may have generated some Sundance or Tribeca buzz as those festivals seem to fill up with films that most people would call ""quirky"")In anycase, for me this was an ""OK"" film, though I could see where others might really enjoy it and rank it far more highly than I have. Certainly worth a rental viewing, and even worth purchase for fans of the stars here."
3,All of the games,"Here are a list of the games. There are a lot of solitaire and slot machine games, so overall it is an average collection.Video Poker (5 versions), Slot Machines (5 versions), Keno, Video, Keno, Roulette, Backgammon, Checkers, Chess, Dominoes, Reversi, Bid Whist, Cribbage, Euchre, Five Hundred, Gin Rummy, Hearts, Oh Pshaw!, Spades, Crazy Eights, Go Fish, I Doubt It, Old Maid, Baker's Dozen, Beleagured Castle, Bristol, Calculation, Canfield, Chessboard, Eagle Wing, Flower Garden, Four Seasons, FreeCell, Golf, King Albert, La Belle Lucie, Pyramid, Rainbow, Scorpion, Solitaire (Klondike), Storehouse, Strategy, Yukon"
5,No joke this album is so PHAT!,"Check this album out. I've heard 100s of rappers from coast-2-coast, this is my all time favourite album even in 1999, they has got their on style and don't just be frontin' on some other rappers."
3,My favorite Lords album -- again by ignorance,"I'm not sure why I haven't bought the other Lords of the Underground albums yet. I just haven't gotten around to it. But this is a really good album. The Lords all have a nice flow despite kind of all sounding the same.Marley Marl and K-Def of Real Live do most of the production, with the Lords handling the rest, and it's all done very well. Marl bangs out the beginning with the piano-laced ""Ready or Not,"" and the bell-ringing ""Tic Toc.""George Clinton shows up --barely -- on the mediocre ""Keepers of the Funk,"" and Lord Jazz rolls solo on the driving ""Steam from Da Knot.""""What I'm After"" rides a sweet horn loop lifted from another Newark, NJ native, Redman. But the Lords put a nice spin on it, rhyming ""I'm after the gold/And after that the platinum/Hip-hop and props/That's what we're after.""Uptempo tracks characterize the album, and the MCs' flow does the production justice. This is definitely an album worth picking up."
3,Lords of the Underground - Keepers of the Funk,"In case you forgot, Lords of the Underground were the ones who brought us the hit, ""Chief Rocka"". And they won't let you forget that, either. Throughout this album, they refer to that song, never wanting to let go of past glory. They also have a tendency to tell ""yo mama"" jokes in their rhymes, which can get frustrating as well. But the beats are dope enough to get your attention, especially on the highlight, ""What I'm After"", which samples fellow Jersey native Redman's ""Tonight's Da Night"" (he appeared in the video for this song)."
3,okay but like the first one better,this did'nt move me back in 94-95 I checked it out only to peep the george clinton collaboration honestly since I'm a huge p-funk fan.
5,"Yaaba, yaabetcha!","Yaaba is probably the best film ever made by an African director. It's one of those rare films that's a great audience film as well as a great work of art. Yaaba is a beautifully told story about the friendship between a boy and girl and an elderly outcast they befriend (the word ""Yaaba"" means ""granny""). It's never cloying or sentimental and there is plenty of wry humor throughout.First-time director Idrissa Ouedraogo's step never falters - every scene is beautifully crafted. His graceful, effortless style achieves a quiet, poetic quality that is very satisfying. I can't recommend Yaaba too highly!"
2,outdated book,The book is good to understand the process; but information/statistics used in the book is very much outdated and misleading. If someone use the book as a guideline to select the potential supplier definitely will be in problem. Author stated that it takes two days to get a fax from a third world country. This is definitely not the case anymore as every country has access to internet. Another place the author stated that only the garments in a developed country (i.e. Italy) have the pattern and sample making facilities. This is not the case anymore. He must be talking about the situation at least 20 years ago. The author needs to visit the countries he used as examples/reference and correct the data/information to make the book useful again.
5,This book is the Gift of Knowledge,"I have learned more from this 285 page book than all my years in this exciting industry working as a fabric designer, pattern maker, CAD instructor, independant consultant, and finally, business owner and manufacturer. David Birnbaum writes with wit, humor and dead-on accuracy. He makes learning about macro costs, direct costs, and indirect costs a fascinating study that is easy to wrap your head around. His observations and forecasts about China, NAFTA,the EU, CBI and Turkey to Indonesia are so insightful. This book is like talking to an Oracle."
5,Does the job,"I bought this to chop up some larger logs for firewood, some maybe more than a foot thick. It chewed through the job pretty well. Not much to compare to, but I felt like it did the job. Wasn't extremely loud."
3,Electric Chain Saw,"Is a good saw, however it came with the handle that wraps abound the left side of the saw was broken. The box looked good, but the saw itself was damaged. However, because I had a lot of tree damage in my yard, and more storms coming, I made due with it. Other then take, it works well, and the chain stops instantly when you let go of the trigger, or push the safety bar."
3,Revere Advantage copper base 9pc,"The heat is uniform and they have been easy to clean until recently. One of the pots seems to be getting rust spots. Obviously, this is not suppose to happen. The other pots and pans are fine. Going to hunt for my receipt."
3,stick with the stand up,"it's like comedians who throw ""funny"" songs at the end of albums that are almost never actually funny. there is some great stand up in here, but there's a bunch of worthless skits that are neither humorous or entertaining. it breaks up the good material and makes it hard to get through. i downloaded the good material to my mp3 player and never listen to the rest. bob's good, but this album is just o.k."
5,best bratz game,i love this game i got it for christmas and i love to play it with my friend or just by myself.Hurry and buy this game before its gone!
4,CRITICISM OF CERTAIN AREAS OF THE BOOK,"In ""The Mathematics of Physics and Chemistry"" [Margenau and Murphy], I found the discussion of Caratheodory's principle extremely obscure and perplexing implying that I had omitted to read a much more elementary introduction to this topic. The section on the existence of integrating factors, exact and inexact differentials was exhaustive and I found this much more readable. The chapter on the application of Jacobeans [functional determinants] to thermodynamics was in my opinion, excellent and not treated anywhere else. These were the only topics in the book of interest to me at the time."
5,Deserves a high rating,"I was completely impressed with this game. As an RPG series, Wild Arms has evolved very well. And 4th Detonator is absolutely an improvement on past installments.But although Wild Arms 4 offers a great RPG experience, the best part of the game is the story line. You simply can't get this kind of writing from contemporary Hollywood movies.Anyone who is looking for an alternative to mainstream media should check it out."
1,"""What da freak is this???""","Did a terrorist sneak into the factory and replace the game disk with one that his ten year old kid made at Bummer School?....'cause I can not recognize it. This game in no way resembles the first three Wild Arms games in any way, shape or form...especially in the quality department. After playing this game for only one hour I threw in the towel out of shear boredom and kissed my hard earned money goodbye! Pong was more exciting. If the makers of this game had one iota of integrity they would stop making games and mug people in the park for money...at least they would be showing enough courage to look their victims in the eye when robbing them. The gameplay would be laughable if I hadn't shelled out fifty bucks for this abortion. I for one am going to go and replay Wild Arms 3....better a rerun of a good game than being bored senseless by a bad new game."
4,Good textbook,"We are reading it aloud to our four daughters who are homeschooled. It is very helpful, but it is a textbook not a fun fiction book."
2,Disappointing,"I bought these to use at an event - the reception wouldn't carry across the building, and when it did work the quality of the sound was pretty poor."
2,short band,"Irritates the skin and pulls the hair into it. Also, I had to pay an additional 12.00 plus shp. to lengthen the band, but it didn't solve the problem."
5,Love the timex perpetual calender!,Literally the best watch I've owned in 10 years. Extremely tough. Had it for 2 years and going strong. A little tricky to set the calender but you only have to mess with it once.I got tired of changing the date on others once a month. My timex has been beaten on. Still water tight. Ive got a dimple in the crystal where i was welding and a piece of slag fell on it but it didnt stop it. You really cant beat it for under 50 bucks.
4,"Great product, but...","I've owned the Gigaset 8825 system and 4 8800 cordless phones now for about a year. In general, I'd agree with most of the reviews. It is a great phone system and generally, I really like the features. I have only one big problem. I can't find 3 of my cordless phones. With two teenaged daughters, the phones seem to be popular after school (and into most of the night). The thing is, they seem to forget to put them back in the charger. The standby power on these things is not all that great. The specs say 80 hours, I'd give it a little more than 8. I've replaced the rechargable batteries a few times, but that doesn't seem to help. Usually, I find these things, but for some reason, they are being very illusive. When they have power, the intercom Call All feature lets me find them easily, but when the power is gone, they are small enough to hide in sofa cushions (looked there), under beds (looked there too). I'm about to offer a reward, teens always need money."
3,"Handy, but very complicated to learn.","I've been using this phone for over year now and it work. However, I cannot say it was easy to use this products. Buttons are small for one and instruction on each mobile unit is not very clear.If you are considering cordless two line phone, try to get the manual for this unit before buyign. Or check out panasonic."
1,This phone is very poorly designed and made.,I own one. The keys fail. Game over. Don't buy this phone.
1,Siemens 8825 2.4 Gig. Base for Corded 8800 System,"I agree with most of the comments I have read on this web page about the 8825 system. I owned an earlier 2420 system and it was the best. I bought a used 8825 system with 4 handsets. The sound clarity is terrible. Range is not as good as earlier 2420 system. Terrible clicking sound on all handsets. Despite all of these issues, however, the most terrible problem is that when the base system (8825) is fried by a storm or surge, there is no way to use the cordless handsets (I have 4). There is no way to repair them and Siemens has no answers or tells one where to get service. Siemens told me when they get one back that is under warranty, they send out new ones. I told the technician that they have to know who fixes the refurbished phones but they claim they do not. So, I had to spend another $250.00 to get another used base system in order to use my 4 cordless phones. No technical repair support has caused me not to ever consider Siemens phones again."
1,"PESIMO TELEFONO, PESIMO SERVICIO",Realmente esperaba muchísimo más de la marca SIEMENS. Este es el PEOR teléfono que he tenido en mi vida. Las funciones de identificador de llamada nunca funcionaron a pesar de que me aseguraron que sí lo hacían. La señal es un desastre. PANASONIC es y seguirá siendo infinitamente superior en telefonía vs. SIEMENS. Es decepcionante. No gaste su dinero y ahórrese malos ratos si está acostumbrado al buen servicio post venta. En SIEMENS simplemente NO EXISTE.
1,La la la la,"Unless you are already an expert at security and are looking for a strictly abstract approach, save your money!! Ramachandran's ramblings go on forever, with little imparted to the reader. The best comparison I can come up with for the experience of reading this book is that it's the same as trying to learn a foreign language from a mime. If Ramachandran spent less time trying to impress us with a bibliography that goes on for pages [I don't really CARE if he has read every security book in the world, if he can't distill this information down and pass it on the text is worthless] and more time on organizing his book [for heaven's sake, is a decent index at the back too much to ask?] then it may be usable, as it is, the only thing to do with it is level a table."
1,not a good reference manual..or book on computer security,"In a course, this book was used as teaching material in a class for computer security. The read, reminded me of speaking software to a hardware engineer. Since the hardware engineer is coming from another level, the experience was like talking DOWN to the reader. The author seemed to want to ""impress"" us with his ""knowledge"". Luckily, we were fortunate to have an instructor that could translate for the class. Had to use other manuals to replace what the author, may have tried to relay."
4,One of a kind,"I don't think Paul Burch fits neatly into any category especially alt country. He's in the too good category. It's country music for people who like classical music, if that makes any sense. Even when he's rocking out, he doesn't lose control. The music is so smooth and groovy that you don't realize that you are moving your feet. His act is that polished. Paul Burch will probably never get huge cause he doesn't turn it up to 11. He doesn't need to."
3,Vast improvement over season one.,"Unlike season one, there are a number of good episodes in this set: Wrestling Opera, Twister of Fate, and Field of Schemes to name a few. The real charm of the show is getting to know Jeff's family and friends in his fictional hometown of Briarton, Georgia. Among these are Jeff's dad, Big Jim played by G.W. Bailey, pal Bill Pelton played by fellow blue collar comedian Bill Engvall, and co-worker Florus Workman played by Neil Giuntoli. But just like season one, the producers kept tweaking the show over and over again, especially with Jeff's boss (three of them in 23 episodes).There are no extras, no commentaries, no subtitles. Menus are the same as the season one set."
1,Very poorly done,"I bought this having been amused with season 1. Unfortunately, season 2 was just pathetic. There were so many holes it's not funny, and the recasting was just absolutely horrible. WHY anyone would like this show is beyond me.Foxworthy, himself is great, and the only reason I don't fully regret purchasing this show, but the rest of this god aweful piece of trash is just horrible, unentertaining and wrong."
2,I wanted to love it but......,"I got this because I thought it would be a good comedy for a cheap price. I couldn't even watch two episodes, it wasn't really funny, it seemed like it was trying to hard to be a family comedy but fell flat. There is a reason you missed this on TV because it just isn't that good.Watch Everybody Loves Raymond or The Cosby Show if you want to be entertained."
2,No pictures !!!,"Cookbook without pictures should be forbidden.Especially when it is a BASICS cookbook meaning for beginners.Maybe the later versions provide pictures, don't waste your money on this one."
5,Terrific cookbook,"My young-adult kids are new to cooking, often calling with questions. This book has been the perfect gift. It clearly describes each type of food and each cooking technique. For each food and method, you'll find one or more delicious recipes to try. In fact, even though I have been cooking for years, it is so handy and well-organized that I also got one for myself!"
4,Very Useful!!,It comes very handy when you want to try something different other than what you usually cook....
1,What a disappointment!!!!,What a terrible disappointment this book was -- it's ALL in the How to Cook Everything cookbook that came out a couple of years ago. You are best to get the larger book and pass this one up. Mine is coming back to Amazon.
4,A good overivew excellent for beginners,This book is a nice addition to any beginner potter's library. It is not in depth but offers a wide variety in information that is useful and helpful. It is most definatly in my 'top 10' of pottery books.
3,"Great for beginners, but hardly 'complete'","I consider myself to be an ""intermediate beginner,"" so this book was at the same time helpful while still containing information that I already knew. It's difficult to have any ""complete"" book on pottery/ceramics that runs under 200 pages. This book is great for people who are new to pottery because it contains info on making coiled, slab, and pinchpots, plus about 40 pages on wheel throwing. What makes this book great for the intermediate learner are the chapters on glazing and decoration - however, it's only an overview, which was fine for me right now, but I will need more information in the future. For any level, there are also a great many examples of modern pottery from teapots to abstract art. Decide for yourself if it's worth buying or borrowing first from a friend or library, depending on your experience level."
5,"Finally, a well written art book!","I recently spent a long evening at the bookstore perusing all the ceramics instruction books, and this was the best of the batch. It is well laid-out and has beautiful photographs of techniques and finished projects, but what really sets it apart is the clear and elegant writing. An excellent book."
4,Happier People,"This cheerful book aims to make us stop and smell--if not roses--whatever is sitting in front of our noses. It is just like the other series of ""Don't Sweat"" books but with a love-minded twist. It offers meditations designed to make us appreciate our lives, keep our emotions in perspective, and cherish other people. I also highly recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Eastern Wisdom"" by Taro Gold. If we all followed the guidance in these books, we would be happier, more harmonious people."
5,"a ""must read"" for all who want to stay married","First given to me by my Best Man, I've since given copies or recommended this book to many friends and relatives, including my wife. With about 35 years of marriage under my belt, ""Small Stuff"" provides a great refresher course to concentrate on what really matters. Written in many (90-100?) two or three page chapters, it is a book that is convenient to read one-chapter-at-a-time, which also allows time for each chapter's message to sink in! Apply it, and it will improve any relationship, not just your primary one."
2,Not the best,"This book was okay. A lot of it was self-explanatory things. Others might find it helpful, but I didn't think it was worth buying."
5,great gift for someone!,This was a gift and even used was great present! Fast shipping! Thanks a lot a lot a lot for having this item
5,Super fast,I got this book used and it was in almost new condition.This book also what shipped extremely fast. I will order from this person again. The content of the book was great. Some of the stuff mentioned in the book were no brainers but some of it got me really thinking about what i find to be a big deal and what i make into a big deal. LOVE this book.
1,nothing new,I've read it all before. There are far better books on relationships out there than this. The chapters are too short and most of the content is obvious and uninspiring. If you've read the author's other books you will notice his tendency to repeat himself again and again and again in each book. Money making idea!
3,Reminders of common sense things we should be doing,"I bought this book at the same time as the original ""Don't sweat the small stuff"" book. Switching back and forth between the two of them, I found them to be a bit repetitive. Its a nice little book though, of reminders to do unto others as you would have done to you. I did especially like the passage about ""whose quirk is it anyway"" - totally described me and let me spin my thinking on matters where I think my S.O. is not doing something up to ""standards"", its definitely because I have odd standards for these things. :) Its a nice book to read a few passages from before bedtime, puts your head in a happy, content place."
3,Good,"Good book, but its just so hard to present what 50 other people have presented in a new and different way."
3,OK CD,I didn't like this as much as I had hoped but maybe I will like it better after I listen to it a few more times. The instrumentals are good. The lyrics are very hard to understand & the female group's voices are very shrill to me.
1,Don't try this at home!,"The protagonist looses his job because he rejects to downsize his department! In return, he starts his own business, obviously together with those who he did not fire, and is successful - obviously.As we force ourselves through a stereotype rich business world, Jeff Cox attempts to explain how small businesses can be made work - at least in ""The Venture-Land"".Another attempt to capitalize from the fiction of the decade called ""The Downsizing of America""?Reduce your bookcount by this one and improve your intellectual bottom line!"
1,Of no redeeming value whatsoever,"I was very disappointed in this book, especially in light of the fact that this is the same person who coauthored Goal. The characters didn't even rise to the level of caricatures, every woman in this book was potrayed as gold-digging nymphomaniac and the men weren't that much better. The whole point about how a new business is created got lost in the morass of subplots and soft-porn vignettes.Just a truly disappointing waste of time and recycled paper."
5,Y1K Is Great,"I'm pretty picky when it comes to books, especially those that look to cash in on the Millennium. But this one was a good read and had some interesting insights. ( It makes you appreciate things like toilet paper, showers, and soup in a can. ) A good book."
4,A Medieval World You THOUGHT you knew.,"I must admit that I had my stereotypes of Medieval England. I could only imagine oppressed, dirty, superstitious people with lives so unbarably hard that they labored through life just waiting to die. Harsh, I know, but I blame the movies... The Year 1000 gives new light to old myths, and in the most light-hearted, layman, even funny ways. Perhaps you imagine the medieval worker as having grotesquely rotten teeth because there was no tooth paste? Actually, their teeth were surprisingly good because sugar had not yet been brought to England. It's little facts like this that make this book perfect for a anyone who wants to know a little more but without being bored to tears."
3,"Easy to Read, Neat Facts, A Bit Disorganized","The authors have written an interesting and timely book. I liked all of the factoids and descriptions they gave about life one thousand years ago in England. Fascinating to see how our ancestors did it (life) facing challenges we have long ago conquored. The organization of the book tends to break up the narrative. It is mildly annoying in places, as are comparisons to current news that will, unfortunately quickly make this book look dated. This situation is caused by the author's using a period calendar as a backdrop to their story and organizing the book around the twelve months of the year and the seasonal activities of the Anglo-Saxons under study.A quick read and overall enjoyable."
4,"Fun and readable. It's not a ""history"" book.","Ok, it's technically a history book. That's certainly the section of the book store (a physical one!) you would find it in. But don't run away--it's readable, fun, eye-opening, and interesting. Keep it close to your coffee table (it's a conversation piece) and thank your lucky stars you were born in the 20th century and not the 10th!"
3,"Interesting, but not what I was hoping for.","Not what I was hoping for; perhaps I should have read the subtitles more carefully. There isn't really much about the millennial event itself; it's more ""what (everyday) life was like"" (subtitle 1) at the time. Even though the title says Year 1000, examples range at least from the 6th through 13th centuries. It also is pretty Anglo-centric (subtitle 2).Not a bad book of its genre, but for a book that treats the impact (assuming most people were even aware of it) of Y1K on its time, I'm still looking."
3,A light and entertainling look at the year 1000 in England,"This book is a lot of fun for the Anglo/Saxon amateur. While full of facts, specualations and tidbits about our developing literature and language it's not a scholarly tome. Rather the book seems aimed at those with a casual interest in the period. As a high school teacher I will uses some of the information in the book to enliven(maybe, maybe not)my classes on Beowulf et al."
2,Nice little book,"This book was a nice little read about the life and times of Britian at the turn of the first millenium. Especially interesting was the likening to the Roman Calander, which was the center of all life and tradition. Particularly I liked the random gems of information I learned from this book: meaning of words, origins of traditions, relations between people and state.This was a very basic overview so don't expect any life-changing realizations after reading this book. But it is a quick and easy introduction to the times and gives a good overview as well as inspiration to expand upon certain topics.Keep in mind this book was written by newspaper journalists, which might explain its short and basic style. Recommended to armchair historians."
3,"Easy to Read, Interesting Facts, A Bit Disorganized","The authors have written an interesting and timely book. I liked all of the factoids and descriptions they gave about life one thousand years ago in England.

4,A gem of a book ...,"I thought the beauty of this book was that it gave some clarityto the French, Viking etc. etc. influences on English culture anddevelopment, and shed light on the earliest developments of a number of the great legacies the English have given the world, such as the justice system and language.It also helps that it's very witty in parts and very easy to read. Highly recommended."
5,You think you've got it rough...,"...then try living in , say, England in the year 1000 A.D.Although I read this book approximately 2000 A.D.,I still remember the profundity of the book 6-7 years later.The author does a fine job of placing the reader withinthe circumstances of actually living in the year 1000.I couldn't help over and over again wondering to myself:""How could I deal with that?"" or ""Could I deal with that?""This book expands the mind as much as any science fictionbook--and this stuff really happened!The reason I'm reviewing this book is because Amazonrecommended the book because of another book I've ordered.The fact that I would take time to review the book yearsafter reading it speaks very well of the book.Easy to read, yet profound: sounds like a great combination to me."
4,made me appreciate that i did not live then!,"i take a lot of things for granted . . . this thought-provoking book made me realize that i have it good! . . . provided a lot of information about what it was like to live back in 1,000."
2,Not a historical novel,"I like history a lot; I even read history books for fun sometimes. I don't know what it was about this book, but I found it very dry, and it could not capture my attention. It is exceedingly easy to put down. I learned a few interesting facts, but had very little fun along the way. I wish the author could have conveyed better what it FELT like to live in the year 1000, maybe along the lines of James Michener....I think it would be easier to enjoy and retain the information presented. The book did leave me feeling grateful to be here at the year 2000, instead of at the title year. I say to Mr. Lacey, spice it up!"
1,Good for the general populace that really doesn't care,"I got halfway through ""March"" before I just got bored. It's not that it's really that bad, but a lot of the ""facts"" are actually just things some people think might be true, and the book jumps around like a high school student's term paper. The whole thing just feels akin to someone saying ""Hey, guess what? Did you know that like, a real long time ago things were real weird and goofy? Haw haw!""Not for anyone who has any real academic interest in early English history."
1,One of the most boring books I've ever read,"Being that I am a history buff, I was so excited when I bought this book. I couldn't have been more wrong. Normally, I can finish a book in six hours; this book took me three weeks. I kept falling asleep reading it!There are no characters or a plot, it reads like a term paper--just facts and dates. It vaguely mentions the lives and events of the ordinary people in the year 1000, and it appears that the authors didn't make an effort to even try to make this book interesting.Do yourself a favor and do not buy this book, unless you need help falling asleep."
1,Boring,"I was excited about getting this book as I wanted to read all about the Year 1000 and what life was like. But, this book was unbelievably boring! There isn't anything to keep you turning the pages. I stopped about 'July' as I couldn't take it anymore. If you want to read about what life was like in the Year 1000,pick another book."
1,Bad,This book bored me. I only got to the third chapter and i couldnt handle it. It was extremely boring I do not recommend it.
5,Color to the Year 1000,"This book grabbed me from the first line and pulled me through pages so quickly that I was amazed to be done within a few hours. I learned many things, including the fact that they had colorful vegetable dyes and their clothing was not all gray. I loved learning about England being a ""melting pot,"" much like later America. It was interesting to learn about the English language and how we got several words in our vocabulary, including the calendar months. (For example, the Norse God Thor is Thors-Day.) It was quite fascinating and very enjoyable and I would invite everyone to read this humorous work."
3,Y1K,"Interesting comparison here of our present age with the year 1000 in Anglo-Saxon Engla-Lond. The work distinguishes itself from other historical work of the same era by using the hook of comparing millennium to millennium, and as such the authors legitimately focus on the year 1000, the time of the Viking longboats, Danes, Ethrelred the Unready, and Y1K in the person of the Anti-Christ. This book is crammed full of information about every aspect of life in the year 1000 with the authors providing the available historical information, which is scanty, and filing in the blanks with their own substantial insight an imagination. Primarily this book is entertaining due to its timeliness, as I might have had somewhat less intense interest in the time period but for the second millennium, and the authors do a superb job of providing that entertainment, but do so with a background of obvious research in a scholarly style still light enough to be enjoyed by all."
4,Read This One!,If you expect to be around for the Y2K read this one. A quick read and worth the time.
3,"Easy to read, Neat facts, Organization makes it disjointed","The authors have written an interesting and timely book. I liked all of the factoids and descriptions they gave about life one thousand years ago in England.

3,Enjoy the snack,"Enjoy the tidbits, forget the connections.Lacey's book, an easy and quick read, is delightful in a certain way. Reading all of the interesting factoids he has gathered is like eating the expensive kind of potato chips--delicious and you can't stop. However, because the book was published as the year 2000 approached, Lacey is compelled, perhaps by his publishers, to offer up some heavier, and much more indigestible, fare in the form of comparisons between the year 1000 and the year 2000. Read quickly past these superficial observations and skip the summarizing last chapter altogether."
4,Interesting and Enlighting,"Truely enjoyed reading this book. Easy and fun read. Full of all sorts of interesting facts - like which month was the most likely for starvation to be a problem. Answer may surprize some. If you like history you'll like this book. However, this is not a novel. Instead it is a descriptive narrative written in a lite, intereting manner."

3,Amusing,"Lacey's work is a good primer, even useful in a basic undergraduate British history class. However, I would not recommend this for an upper level or graduate level student. Its intention of giving and introduction to social values and practices at the time under consideration is well executed, but that is all it does."
4,MILLENIUM LIGHT,A good introduction to the time period with lots of interesting factoids. This is a light read but not a substitute for deeper information needed by the advanced student. Enjoyable but not something I would re-read.
3,An interesting introduction to the era.,"The Year 1000 provides a fast, generally engaging overview of life at the turn of the first millennium AD. The book, by two newspaper reporters, breezes over volumes of archaeological and literary research produced by dedicated historians and other specialists. At its best, it provides amusing anecdotes and meaningful insights into daily life and concerns of the medieval English, e.g. the preoccupation with spirits and saints among all levels of society. At its weakest, it states as fact topics that still engender keen debate. While generally an easy read, turgid stretches reflect the authors' lack of background in the subject.In sum, an interesting, if casual introduction to medieval England."
4,A good overview of the High Middle Ages,I bought this book in the UK for the flight back and it was one the best things I bought over there. If you want a down and dirty overview of what our ancestors life was like then here you go. (Am I ever glad to live in 21st Century America!) This book is well organized by being based on the months of the calendar and has a lively text that is just packed with interesting facts & tidbits. Basically its another example of the excellence of British writing about the past.

5,whole family enjoyed this interesting easy read,"I read this book, all the while my spouse asking me if I was through yet ... The minute my spouse was done with it, we gave it to mom who loves English history. Very fun and interesting book."
5,A fascinating glimpse into the past,"Totally useless as a reference to today's standards of Artificial Intelligence know-how, this book is a fascinating look into the 1976 cutting edge knowledge and a glimpse of what academics were striving for. Covering such classic topics as ELIZA and the various simple algorithms of AI of the time - with examples of 'current technology' that would make any geek smile. I love this book.A text that provides good reading to anyone who loves to reminisce or explore the path our technical scientists took to bring us to today's AI systems. Well worth having a dog-eared copy on your bookshelf."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"If you are looking for a dvd of yoga exercises to reduce your blood pressure, don't waste your money on this one. It is not a guided exercise program, it is simply an introduction to many different yoga poses. They don't give you enough time to complete the poses before moving on to the next one in the hour long dvd. You'd have to memorize all the poses and do them on your own to get the full benefit. The most annoying thing of all is the horrible music that plays so loudly you cannot hear the voice over instructions. Plus, the copy I got would not play on my DVD player and would only partially play on my computer. I was extremely disappointed with this product. And, the seller MusicIndia didn't even have the courtesy to respond to my request for a replacement for the defective DVD. Total waste of money."
3,Sweeden's Sweetest Treat - Hard Rock Candy,"Sweeden's Hellacopters are nothing new. They've been on the scene now for 10+ years. This release is only a continuation of their long tapestry of slash-and-burn rock albums that prooves once again that this un-American group knows more about American R & R history than most American R & R bands.If you're not hip, here's a walking stick: The Hellacopters get a lot of comparrisons to The Black Crowes. While this is a half-truth, think of The Hellacopters as The Black Crowes with more MC5 than Faces. Their newest release shows these four Sweeds (plus an additional keyboardist who doesn't get in the way) getting into more blues-based ideas rather than their early recordings that are comprised of straight-up aggressive rock songs. Hell, maybe rock and roll is dead for The Hellacopters. Oh wait - the album title now makes sense."
4,I got some monkey business to attend!!!!!!!!!,"If Rock n roll is dead, with Hellacopters it looks in good shape, really is great to discover that interesting transittion metal-death-grindcore-stoner maybe it has been to much for many people but for others like me have been incredibly exciting, Hellacopters perform real and pure rock n roll with 70s southern influences a mix between Skynird, Alabama, Black Oak Arkansas, Foghat even Eagles etc, etc, but the root of metal is there is really amazing, from now on im a Monkeyboy too.Check this album if you like southern and metalHM"
3,Disappointment Blues,"The Hellacopters have long been one of my favorite rock-n-roll outfits and I've enjoyed their progression from a hard rockin' loud fast rules kinda thing to a more Stones-y blues-arena-rock-pop thing. Great songwriting and hooks and an extremely impressive track record when it comes to avoidance of cliches and self-parody. This latest seems to mark the end of the line; the well's done gone dry. Dry, uninspired and devoid of the pervasive catchiness that marks most of the 'Copters' later recordings. This record has it's moments, but certainly not thirty three bucks worth of 'em. Rock-N-Roll appears to be, if not dead, on the critical list. Man, was that corny. Sorry."
4,Mesmerizing,"This book was my second experience with Norman Mailer's work. There will most definitely be a third. Although it may have been slightly too long, it was nevertheless meticulously detailed. It reads wonderfully as a ""non-fiction"" novel. After reading this book, I didn't develop much sympathy for Gary Gilmore, but my view of the death penalty has changed. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys true crime and history. If you can get through the 1000+ pages the ride will be well worth it. For comparison, Grisham's ""The Chamber"" was vastly inferior."
1,Worst,"Pulitzer Prize? Who in the right mind gave it 5 stars? Pathetic story, depressing worst piece of s*** I ever laid my eyes on. I am pissed. Worthless."
4,"A VERY GOOD BOOK, BUT WAY TOO LONG","I found this very interesting, and certainly makes you think about the death penalty. I was bothered that the focus is on the life and death of Gary and not nearly as much on the people he killed. It almost seemed that we accepted the fact that he killed people and that his rights at that point were the most important thing. I felt the book was long, but I don't know what parts could have been left out"
4,Great... with a bit TOO much.,"This is the sixth Norman Mailer book I've read, and although tells a great story about Gary Gilmore, the killer of two in Utah in the mid-Seventies, it packs entirely too much information. While reading this book, I found myself wishing more had been written about Gary and his life, and his relationship to his family and common law wife Nicole than about all the intricate details of the legal procedings after his sentencing. The back half of the book is loaded with seemingly endless milieu related to all the legal proceedings involving Utah's lack of mandetory appeal for those sentenced to death. It also seems to get too deep into the particulars of the media frenzy surrounding Gilmore ... namely that of Larry Schiller and his battle to aquire various rights to Gilmore's story ... though that story thread does have something of a redemption. All in all, it's a great book, but tends to drag."
2,"A Long, Drawn Out Disappointment","My low rating is by no means a commentary on what a prolific writer Norman Mailer is. And I also appreciate the complexities of telling this story and attempting to be as inclusive as possible- a task that Mailer completed more than successfully. However, the book never grabbed me. Some of the colloquial writing style bothered me (see use of the word ""Now"" to begins so many narrative sentences) and, with the book as long as it was, too many characters faded from view for large portions of the novel. Excellent telling of the story, but not as gripping as I had hoped."
4,An American Master,While the great American novel has not yet been written Mailer has come close several times and this is his best book. It is haunting from star to finish. Everyone should pick up THE EXECUTIONER'S SONG.
2,conjecture can be tiresome,"mr mailer's style of writing using conjecture to create moments in time in gary gilmore's life left me uninterested. the purpose, im sure was to lead the reader to the cause of the killer's actions but it did not work for me as I found the style of writing non-absorbing and too much of a drag to get through. I put the book down after 100 pages or so."
2,"Too sympathetic treatment of a murderer, but still gripping","Norman Mailer paints a much too sympathetic portrait of a man who blamed his upbringing and the dominant society for his problems and actions. The narrative is engaging, but Gilmore is made to be the hero of the story in the rather one-sided account. Based on historical value, the book is probably necessary reading, but the end result left me uneasy. Times have changed a little here in Utah County, but the climate still does not regularly spawn murderous acts, as the novel appears to insinuate. Aside from these problems, however, the book, to be fair, is gripping and difficult to put down."
3,Yikes!,"Be prepared for a long haul....this book is very tedious, and goes into much unnecessary detail. It also characterizes Gary and Nicole's relationship as ""loving/romantic"". Not so much - more like Gary abused and controlled her! If you are looking for a good ""true-life novel"" of this sort, stick to Truman Capote's In Cold Blood. IF you are looking for a good book about the death penalty and death row, try John Grisham's The Chamber."
2,Too many words,"A heart wrenching story that got drowned in too many irrelevant details. The way that Gilmore and his compatriots spiraled downwards is gripping, but the number of cigarettes smoked each day, banal conversations, and details of each person's daily life, made me lose interest in these miserable people after the first 800 pages."
3,Did anyone else notice all the typos?,"Yes, it was an important event in our nation's history. No one would dispute that, but Mailer's account follows all the wrong roads. Without a better understanding of who Gilmore is and why it's so important for him to assert control over his life, I ended up not caring an awful lot about a guy who didn't seem to care much about anyone but himself."
3,Way too long!,"ok, I get it, a love story gone very bad, normally I can read a book in a couple of days, maybe a week. This one I just can't seem too finish, but after 800 plus pages, I feel too invested to put it down."
4,A good story,"By telling a story, the principle and legal concept become easier to understand. I am convinced this book deserves the award."
3,"Started off great, then lost interest.","Read such great reviews about this book, a sort of embellished documentary about convicted killer, Gary Gilmore, who was executed in the state of Utah in the 70s. Never read any Mailer before, but this book in print is over 1,000 pages and after two months I only made it about 2/3 through which is about the point where Gilmore is convicted. I have a feeling that the interesting part comes later -- the part about his being on death row and wanting to be executed so I may have done myself a disservice by stopping here, but honestly, I was just ready to move on to something else."
2,a grim narrative,The subject is not worthy of a 1000 page story. In Cold Blood was a better book about pathological personalities.
3,i like my uncensored dvd's uncensored,"great but i prefer my uncensored dvd's uncensored!!while i loved both volume 1 and 2...i hate it when you advertise that the dvd is uncensored (it's even in the title!!) and then you go and censor it!! on the 2nd dvd it has deleted scenes ""uncensored"" and you censor a girl trying to show you how to easily get to her clit!! it should be called ""the best of insomniac with dave attell : volume 2"". saying it is uncensored is a bit misleading."
3,Not so uncensored after All,"I beg to differ with reviews that claim that this DVD is completely uncensored. While it does show full-frontal male nudity and several topless women, it stops short once the female genitalia are displayed. During the so-called ""Uncensored Deleted Scenes"", a lovely lass from Key West gets carried away and shows her all to the camera. Her breasts are shown, but her nether region is blurred out. This is uncensored? The last time I checked, that meant ""not censored"". If this sequence could not be shown in it's entirety, why include it at all? Especially in a section claiming to be uncensored? It is interesting that a prolonged scrotum piercing and a cow insemination are ok, but a vagina is not.The DVD is very entertaining and will not disappoint from a comedic standpoint, but, on principal, it should deliver what it promises and it does not."
4,Definitely readable!!,"I was born the year Elvis hit it big, and I have heard his music all my life. Now, I got a chance to get into what Elvis was about, and how his music, his fame, affected him and others. It was wonderful reading..... a bit slow at times, but over all, it made me feel I got to know Elvis as a person, which I had never felt before. I definitely recommend this book, and am going to buy the next one as well!"
4,Brings new life to Elvis,"Although I agree with some of the comments here, specifically those about Guralnick's confusing writing style, I truly enjoyed this book. Guralnick neither overly praises nor denegrates Presley's actions, but instead offers the reader as true an account as possible. The author does an excellent job of showing who influenced Elvis, both before and after he hit it big. I'm a-gonna' start Volume 2 as soon as I can!"
5,A must read,"Guralnick gives us Elvis Presley before anyone knew his name, showing readers what this boy was like before he was the King. A frank, wonderful biography that shows us why our country is the way it is, and only reinforces Elvis Presley as the most influential white man in music in the past 100 years or so. I am a 25 year old white male who grew up in the North, and never was exposed to Elvis. I read this book to learn more about the man everyone talks about, the one people are obsessed about, and discovered why his influence lasts. A powerful, un-put-down-able read."
4,Hunk o Burnin Love,"This dude can write. A labor of love. He re-creates what Elvis did, day by day by day by day in his early years.Didn't know this, but right after he got out of high school and was trying to make a name for himself at the VFW Dance Hall - Country Fair - Amarillo Texas Jamboree type gigs, Elvis did A LOT of touring! Playing in small clubs, all over the South, night after night after night after night after night. So some of this gets a little tedious. But not much. This dude - Gurlanick - can write like nobody's downchild. A good read!"
4,Elvis fan a must,"It was a good purchase and had information not known to the recipent of this book. However, it is a slow read."
5,"The true tale of the early, sweet and innocent Elvis...","Such an antidote to Goldman's sleazy Elvis book -- this book literally oozes truth and reality as opposed to Goldman's hillbilly fantasies. Guralnick is the best there is when he's writing about indigenous music of the South. Loved this book, loved Sweet Soul Music, and can't wait for the sequel"
5,Feeling What Elvis Felt,"I can't believe that someone could actually write a book this good. I felt what Elvis was feeling at very moment; while walking down streets, in studios, everwhere. I felt I was beside him while he went though his early life. Peter Guralnick was on a roll when he wrote this. None can compare. Buy it."
5,A must read.,"This is the second installment of this biographer's tale of Elvis. It is a must read for those who read the first book. If you're not interested in Elvis's early life, this book can stand alone."
4,Settle in With This One,"A tremendously thorough biography by someone who knew Elvis well. Tons of information, and more than a few surprises. This is an experience for several evenings. Settle into the recliner with a mug of hot chocolate and enjoy the ride."
2,Snooze,"I read tons of books last year. Tons. From biographies to classics to The Art of Fielding. I love, love reading. And as the biggest Beatles fan I've ever met, I was excited to read a big fat book about the King. Well, I don't mind being the only person to say that this book is just plain boring. There is no debating the research or the depth of Guralnick's knowledge about his subject. But knowledge does not a great writer make. This book seems widely praised for its lack of interest in soap opera detail, but that's what I was craving. I wanted a big, salacious, fat smorgasbord. This was a salt-less and dry chicken breast. Is it nutrient rich, yes? Is it something I was excited to eat after the first bite? In a huge way, no."
2,Don't buy the abridged tapes!,"I was stuck on a long car ride with the abridged version of this book. In order to get it down onto two cassettes, the abridgers consistently managed to suck every bit of life and color out of the story, producing the Monarch Notes equivalent of the story. You could tell where the interesting quotes would have gone. I've learned my lesson; I'll only listen to unabridged tapes from now on."
2,weirdly balanced adaptation,"This game does its best to capture the spirit of The Amazing Race, including variations on Detours and Roadblocks, and incorporating Yields and Fast Forwards, but overall it falls flat.The vast majority of gameplay consists of answering questions on cards and then moving forward a number of spaces for answering correctly. This is fine when questions are geography- or culture-related, and for die-hard Race fans, even the trivia questions pertaining to racers from the show are acceptable. However, in the case of Detours, players blindly pick one of two options, and one option allows players to move forward further than the others.The game is entertaining for people who follow the show faithfully, but for players more interested in the board game itself, the blind luck involved in Detours and the inclusion of show-specific trivia questions is a turn-off."
1,"dusty, old, and torn packaging","While the product I received was exactly a dinner plate, cup, and bowl-all products appeared dusty, packaging was torn and broken, and there was scotch tape all over the bowl and cup. This product was something I could have paid $1 for in the 99 cent store, but apparently I paid an additional $15 simply for the ""Disney"" name. NEVER AGAIN will I buy anything from an ""Amazon Seller""."
3,Linguafun,"These are great cards and we've learnt quite a bit. It is limited however. I wish they would bring out more cards. The CD was great because the people were actually french speakers so the accent was particularly good. I would still recommend these to anyone. The only disappointment we had was that there was no instructions on how to play the games. Apparently there is meant to be but in the ones we got it was missing (the pack was sealed). I did contact the company that makes them, but didn't get a reply. Would have been a lot more fun had we had the game instructions."
3,Interesting sound,"First off, I'm not really a fan of this type of music so take this review with a grain of salt. I got the cd because I used to love ""Green Mind."" The music itself is sort of industrial/hip hop/dance mixture that varies between pretty cool and downright annoying. Think Pig Face or KMFDM with out the anger management issues. It's worth the listen if you are interested in exploring different types of music, but there is a reason why you can get the album for under a buck.By the way, yeah ""Green Mind"" will always rock!"
1,"""MARINE SURVEYING"" Review","I was given this book to review by the YDSA, being a practising yacht surveyor in Britain. I found it to be a very poor book, written by somebody who, so far as can be seen, is not a marine surveyor but a lecturer in marine ventilation. A colleague who also reviewed the book agreed.It would be of no help, and could be misleading."
2,disappointed,"I was excited to get this box so I could have portable music that would play radio, cd's, satellite and MP3's in the backyard & at the beach.I don't blame the unit itself. The problem is that it was made for Sirius satellite units and not XM units, which is what I have in my car. When the companies mergedthe technology did not. I would have to purchase adapter cables and get tech suppport to attach them in order to use the boombox satellite with my unit.I don't want all those wires out so I'm returning this item."
1,Don't buy,"XACT is a dishonest company. They claim to have a warranty on their products, but there is literally NO WAY to get them to repair or replace a product. If you call their support number, you get an automated system with no option to talk to an operator. Instead, the system gives you an e-mail address. Then you have to e-mail them several times to get a response, and all they say is ""Send it back to the retailer,"" even after the 30 day return period.I bought theXACT COMMUNICATIONS XG2500 Cordless Headset Telephonein late 2008 and it was of mediocre but acceptable quality at first. But then the battery life took a nosedive. A cordless phone that lasts ten minutes on a full charge isn't useful. And that happened during the one year warranty period. But I couldn't get a repair, replacement, or refund from the company. So my only recourse is to give out one-star reviews and warn others about the company."
4,"Excellent value, even without satellite.","I picked this up for about $25 so I could play mp3 discs, and knew it was a bit of a gamble at that price. I was really surprised at the size and quality. Only complaint is that it doesn't read mp3 discs very well. It only wants to play the first folder on the disc. All in all a good buy."
2,Made a buzzing/humming noise,"This radio would have been great if you wanted to listent to it loud all the time. If you wanted to listen to it quietly at work, however, it was a problem. As soon as the satellite radio was connected, the radio started making a very loud and obnoxious buzzing/humming noise. I'm assuming something wasn't grounded correctly or something, but if you tried to put to music on quietly, the buzzing/humming noise simply overpowered it. If you plan to have your music on at a higher volume (high enough to drown out the buzzing noise), though, this radio works just fine."
4,Eerie,I saw this album on fangora and thought it would be interesting. I was surprised. It is an eerie album. I've enjoyed listening to it immensely.
5,Halloween Magic,This was just what I was looking for for my Halloween evening fun. I had many different reactions. Most thought it was really eerily neat.
5,Simply Excellent,"These guys are simply the best Mariachi band in the U.S... and truly give Mariachi Vargas a run for their money. Unfortunately their recordings are not as good as their live performances in which they routinely grant us some surprises like ""Orange Blossom Special"", ""Caravan"" or ""Nereidas""."
5,"Fantastic, buy this immediately","I'm with J. Marquez; you have not lived until you've seen these guys live. With arrangements by the great violinist Jesus Guzmán, every last one of them is a top-notch musician and vocalist. The trumpet player, who can blow any opera tenor out of the water, deserves a special shout out."
4,It's kinda neat,"It's just a pen that is spring loaded and pops up a few feet. So, don't be expecting a ""rocket."" That said, it's pretty cool."
4,"Not exactly as pictured, but not bad either","I ordered 2 for my 2010 Forester. They are 1/2 the price of the Subaru chrome accessory tips and (IMO anyhow) look much better. The only problem is, they are all chrome, *not* partially gloss black as pictured, and therefore, I expected. They look good either way. I may just hit them with some VHT flat-black paint once they start to show signs of surface rust anyhow. Plus, they must have been sitting in a warehouse for a few years because the labels were pretty stuck to the chrome, so I had to use alcohol and lot of elbow grease to clean them up. One came with a set of 4 extra clips, not sure why, but at least I have replacements when the originals rust. Overall, a pretty good deal and a low-cost mod for your car."
4,These poems were great.,"The poems in gary soto's latest book [A fire in my hands]are so descriptive they are telling stories. Each poem he writes is a moment, and in some of the poems you feel like you are really there. The reason I gave this book four stars is because some of the poems are too much like stories and it doesn't have the same effect on you as it would if it were more poetic and less like a storie though I do know since I am a writer myself that each author has their own style, and some of his poems were not exactly enthralling so I said above. I am 11 and since I read it I would recommend this book to kids maybe 10 to adult because people younger might not understand some of the poems and that totally takes away the effec of poetry. Thanks for reading my review, Lizzy"
5,The War that changed the world,Since I Love Leaning about WWII it was a great book. It has a lot of pictures but explains about WWII well. So if you want to learn about WWII it is a good book. If you don't just like reading books with words and don't pictures to make it more interesting then it would definatly be a good book. If for some reason you don't like books with a lot of pictures then mabye you should get a different book.
3,For MATURE readers,I bought this book as a gift and quickly decided it was inappropriate for the intended recipient. Pictures are very graphic and disturbing. I gave it to our high school librarian and she reviewed it and placed it in an area reserved for teachers and mature readers -- too graphic to be placed on the open shelf. It is appropriate for a mature reader/historian interested in the time period. There is a then and now section that looked interesting - how the events of WW2 influenced recent cultural events and world history.
4,world war 2,"In world 2 there was a war in Hawaii. (Four star book.) it is all about war and places thats on fire.And the war was long ago. And it has great pictures on the world war 2 book. This bookhas alot of airplanes in it. And it has a map that shows where it was major battle. the battle was amazing, and the war. AND ALSO THE BOOK IS GREAT!"
1,Worst Crimper In My Collection,"Crimped about 30 or so RJ45's after that many of the pins on the RJ45's did not depress into the wires. It was also random at times, properly crimping pins and then not. Leaving one, two or three pins up. Recrimping would sometimes help but not always. Purchased an Platinum Tools EZ-RJ45 Crimp Tool and no more issues. Do not recommend."
5,Best sports documentary I've ever seen...,"I've seen my share of sports movies...Moneyball being the most recent...and what stood out to me the most about that excellent movie is the unique personality of the manager/coach. Well the documentary ""1: The Story Behind the Longest Winning Streak in Football History"" is no different in that respect. Talented players come and go but it's the coaching that sets apart the good teams from the great teams. This documentary provides a real explanation as to how a coach can take a team, year after year, with different players each year (remember this is high school football so players only play for an average of 1-4 years on the team), and maintain the longest winning streak in football history is nothing short of miraculous. There is no other story like the one portrayed in this documentary. If you are a sports fan of any size or shape, you would be doing yourself a favor by watching this film."
3,Football In California,"This video is not full of football action, so if thats what you are looking for, this isnt for you. But it is interesting to see how one of California best High School Football programs in history is run. Full of interviews from coaches/players."
3,Fun for Many,"I like horror films. At times, I like B horror films.I think Grave Danger is a fun parody of them. Jim Haggerty has taken a genre and played with it intelligently.I like the acting. Vic Martino is a hoot in the film. I enjoyed his scene chewing.A good time for all."
2,"Fine playing, dreadful sound","I agree with a couple of the other comments here - fine playing is let down by truly awful sound. What on earth are Hyperion playing at? I notice that the rot set in when Tony Faulkner was replaced by Simon Eadon on piano recordings. The sound is thin and completely unresonant in the bass, and some kind of dreadful digital, piercing, pianola-like plinkety plonk in the treble. Just listen to the closing minute or so of the fourth scherzo! It is such a shame as the sound on Hough's earlier recordings for Hyperion was exemplary (listen to the Liszt sonata and the Franck discs for example)."
2,"disappointing, salonish performances","I've enjoyed many of Stephen Hough's performances in the past, particularly his delightful ""Albums,"" his Hummel and his Mendelssohn. But in this case, he reduces some of Chopin's greatest music to salon proportions. Virtually every work here is ruined by incessant toying with phrasing and tempo and the disclosing of nonexistent inner voices. At one point in the first scherzo he suddenly begins playing at half tempo! Nor is his technique impressive. The octaves in the third scherzo, for example, are clumsy. To boot, the sound on this cd is cold and remote, far below Hyperion's usual standards. I'm sure Hough will produce much better discs than this careless production in the future. But avoid this disc and stick with Moravec and Perahia in the Ballades and Rubinstein and Richer in the scerzi."
2,Erratic,"I agree with Mr. Steiger, and he says it so well I won't belabor the point. My reaction to this recording is that the playing here is erratic and spastic, and that Mr. Hough was merely trying to sound innovative or ""different"" so that listeners would imagine he was presenting a well-thought out interpretation."
5,Excellent!!,This book is really good! I suggest you to read this outstanding book. Filled with great action just for you! I was at the end of my seat for the whole story! I couldn't put it down for one second! Great for any age and I loved it! I'm sure you would to... I grantee it!!
3,Summary of the DSP theory!,"Best for study-a-night-before-test students. A 5 stars book for those kind of students. Theories were written with very short explanations, avoiding confusing details, which give well understanding (though not deep). I consider the filter section is the best; after you read this section, you are able to know and design various kind of filter in a very short time of reading."
1,High School writing class,"This book is amateurish writing at high school level. The women characters are shallow and not interesting, the book really doesn't have a sense of place although it is named Galveston. I bought it used for a dollar. It was a quick read and a quick toss to the trash can."
1,Vacuous romance novel,"Characters in this late 19th-century/early 20th century novel are almost uniformly narcissitic, shallow, and unsympathetic. Also, the author didn't do her homework (e.g., calling Galveston then the 2nd biggest city in Texas, a ""small town""). This is a good one to avoid unless your only desire is to not think for an extended period of time."
3,A sports doctor's complete guide for parents by Jordan Metzl,"I though I had done that already. So, once again, the book arrived on time but the sender failed to tell that this was a LIBRARY BOOK. It was full of stickers with library numbers on the cover and inside the book itself. Had I known this, I would not have bought it. It's one thing to buy a ""used"" book. It's another, to buy a used book with stickers and notations. So, I am not very pleased and I emailed the sender upon receipt."
3,"should be entitled ""astor piazzolla INSPIRED/milked ""","BIG F*NG NOTE PEOPLE~~ this is just an astor piazzolla INFLUENCED acid jazz album; not an astor piazzolla REMIXED album. the only songs I like are #2(...bossa nova sounding and repetitive) & 4(... not really tango; more dub/strings/trip hop). A remix album should have at least 50% original material with accents...this just contains 6 second loops of original Piazzolla material used as a sort of ""spine"" to build up the rest of the meager songs. Track 8 is so lame all the guy says is ""said I wanna be dancin witcha baby""...freakin' annoying! But I guess if your into elevator music this is a good album."
2,?,"I'm not sure about the benefits of this product... difficult to say. Anyway, it seems to me that it works partially"
4,Great blend of traditional and modern,"I searched high and low for the perfect Tapas book for my wife. She loves this one. Beautiful pictures, great recipes and not too many really-hard-to-find ingredients. Give this one a try.I only gave it four stars instead of five because not every recipe in the book has a corresponding photo. Sometimes you have to use your imagination."
1,A vampire with no bite,"This was a HUGE disappointment. I do not understand why readers love this guy. It cant be his writing. It just cant! The characters were so cliche here. Like they were pulled from another book of his, given a different name and hair color and yet they're the same. The exact same. Check out Brothers of Blood or Desmond for a good gay vampire story."
2,Disappointing,"I thought this would be as good as the same publisher's Air Disasters series. I was sadly disappointed. The choice of incidents was eccentric, the writing turgid and cliche-ridden, and the illustrations left a lot to be desired. Get the four Mac Job books first I suggest."
1,"Same title, different songs","Ktel has a nasty habit of re-using titles from their LPs, but with completely different contents. The LPs had either 20 or 24 songs; the CDs waste space with only 10 songs. What a gyp! Hardly even worth the shipping cost."
2,A waste of time and money,"I purchased a copy of this book some time ago hoping it would give more insight into my ayurvedic massaging. I was disappointed to find it's filled with many misinformations. First of all, the author has no idea of differentiations between vedic, yogic and ayurvedic. Secondly there are some really strange statements (""acupuncture originated from marma therapy""), which are founded more on the author's vivid imagination and are not supported by any evidence... Thirdly, no contraindications for ayurvedic massage are given. Lastly the massage techniques are given very vaguely/crudely.The only good thing about this book are the dosha descriptions, but that can be found in most ayurveda related books.I strongly suspect the other reviewer who wrote two (!) positive comments must be a friend of the author.Ultimately, a waste of both time and money."
4,Romantic story,"As a young teenager, I faithfully read Emily Loring books. After getting my Kindle, I looked her up again.I was glad to find this one, especially as it's one I haven't read. It's just an old-fashioned love story, noblazing heat here, just a good story. Many of her other novels include a bit of mystery and intrigue, I haven'tfinished reading Trail of Conflict, but as when I was younger, I can't put this one down, hopefully, her othernovels will be added."
5,great,"The Trail of Conflict by Emily LoringMarriage of convenience: his hand for her money.Steve Cortland and Gerry LaMorgan must live on the ranch for at least a year using only Steve's money but conflicts arise.If the one year goes by Cortland will win back all his estate holdings mortgages, paid in full. If Steve refuses the offer everything will be foreclosed upon.She takes up riding the countryside and does call on a local woman that's been there a whole year with no company.Steve worries when she leaves the ranch as there are many other men and they don't want to find out why they are around.Love detailed descriptions of nature, sky colors and life on the ranch.Problem is she's walked into an ambush and with some help from others it's not going to turn out well..."
5,"This is a CLASSIC, Far better than Heavy Metal even","The first time I saw this movie, I enjoyed the Hell out of it. Then I saw it again, and again, and again. Hell, it is THE best cartoon based movie with classic music that can be found. If you thought Heavy Metal was good, this will blow your mind. Songs from the 70's appear throughout this movie, including such tunes as Undertow by Genesis, that fit the mood and scene of the movie to a TEE> If ANYONE knows where to find a copy of this, PLEASE FIND ME!!!!!!! Great comedy from start to finish on this one!"
2,A few nagging problems,"The ball rack in this set is too small. You can not lift it off without moving the balls. The table brush is constantly leaving behind bristles. If you don't care or need those 2 items, the set is acceptable. I need those items, so it is below average for me. Now I will have to go to a billiards supply store. I want to test the ball rack to make sure the size is right."
5,Appropriate Title,This book contains short devotionals that are practical. Elizabeth Elliot's heart sold out to God comes through loud and clear. The Biblical truths really quiet the heart.
4,Worthy and helpful Evangelical essays,"...I found these short Evangelical essays to be based in Biblical truths and geared toward the problems of human life and the human condition and, in some instances, prophetic messages about the particular evils of our time and society.The little essays may be read as daily devotional pieces or, as I did, the book may be approached and read through in several settings."
5,Elvis - Fun In Acapulco,"Nice cd. It is great to have a cd that looks exactly like the original album cover, front & back. Nothing was left out and the music is as good as when I first heard it."
3,Sweet music floating across the square.,"This Elvis Presley soundtrack album was recorded in January of 1963. It is better than average for an Elvis soundtrack. The music has a Latin feel to it that makes it unique among Elvis albums. Most of the songs are good, but there are a few that are rather silly, especially ""No Room To Rhumba in a Sports Car"". The single from the album was ""Bossa Nova Baby"", which reached #8 on the Hot 100. The original album included two bonus songs from May of 1963 which were not from the movie, and they are incuded on this CD as well. The CD also adds many other bonus tracks, which are all alternate takes of songs from the movie. Seven of the eleven movie songs have alternate takes included here. The other four songs most likely didn't have complete alternate takes (two of them were completed on the first take). This is fun album for Elvis fans, but only a serious Elvis fan would pay the high price it costs to get it."
3,Good for what it is.,"Elvis fans tend to adore every song, every album and every movie the man ever participated in. To be fair some of them are awesome and some are not-so-awesome. I wasn't around yet but the real ground-breaking music of the 1960's came from the Beatles (who were, of course, heavily influenced by Elvis.) Regardless, Fun In Acapulco was a one of Elvis' better films and this soundtrack is a good listen as well. He goes into some Latino-style sounds which make this a unique album in the Elvis canon. There's no extensive liner notes or photos to be found here but the sound quality is excellent and you can't beat the price so why not pick it up? Today is the day he passed away in 1977. Rest in peace E. We miss you man."
4,hear it from Huck,I am a pilot who up until this year hadn't flown in over twenty years. Reading this book opened my eyes again to my love of flying and the spiritual freedom I have enjoyed by my time in the air. Because of this book I have once again started flying. But the book is more than just flying. It is about finding out what is important to you -REALLY important and finding the courage to look beyond all of the excuses for not following your dream. Trust the universe and do what you were meant to do!!
4,Excellenet timepiece,"I really like the presence of this piece on my wrist; as another writer put it, it has a nice old-world look and feel. The strap/braclet is a very nice link design. The face has very nice detail and not bland; the hands, too, have contour.This is a swiss-made, classy looking watch with good fit and finish. I am very happy with it."
4,very nice mechanical swiss movement watch,"took this to my jeweler to get it sized for my wrist. He said it was an excellent Swiss mechanical movement; worn it for several days and its movement and spring last much longer than 24 hours and keeps excellent time; the cantilever clasp takes some getting used to close the watch, particularly after the slack is taken out of the band; I use my chin to pin the watch to my wrist while I manipulate the clasp to snap it closed. The first time I could not do it, and that's when I had to resort to using my chin to hold the band in place...it can be done. The cantilever closure must be a ""safety"" so that the watch will not fall off the wrist if the snap becomes undone.At first it seems daunting."
5,Really Nice watch,No need to describe Tissot's build and quality. bought as a gift and my in law loved it.Good price compared with other vendors. Go for it..
1,it stops frequently,"The watch looked good, but there are two problems. First, when I opened the box the moment i received it, i found there were no warranty card and no user's manual except two flyes about the watch. Second and the most important problem is that in the past few days the watch stops frequently without movements after some short time. I wore the watch every time and everywhere, even when i was having a bath or when i was playing basketball, but still i found it stopped at 3 o'clock one morning, and 5 another morning, and 7 another morning. Therefore, I didn't know what the time is when i woke up and I had to adjust the watch everyday i opened my eyes. I wonder what is wrong with it and what i can do with that. Thanks a lot."
1,Shame of TIssot,"Only after 1 month's normal wear, a gear dropped from the caliber (ETA 2824-2) and sticked inside, I sent it back to Amazon 6 weeks before but it's still under working~! Never buy it and I will never buy a Tissot watch again~!"
4,A good value,"For an automatic Swiss Made watch, this is among the least costly you'll find. The good and bad with this is the watch is Swiss Made, but the refinement and overall feel is below more costly Swiss watches. The watch a great old school look to it."
4,stimulating guide to the concealed,"This is a good book if you like art. From the American point of view it features dense art steeply mannered to suit an unfamiliar milieu. I find the featured art producers evocative of new ideas. There are many pictures, in art books there can always be more pictures. The text is okay, for an art book, not particularly ludicrous or pathetic like art books usually are. Since the book treats of artists I knew nothing about previously, I'm too ignorant to judge whether it should have had different emphases. IRWIN seems as correct as Laibach."
3,Tatting: A new look at the old art of making lace,This book has some interesting ideas for tatting but using large threads or yarns isn't the way I like to tat but some of the patterns are very nice.
5,works great. love the size. awesome,"This product was recommended to us by our IT company, BICOM, and we love it. the size is great and easy to hide, while the sound is clear and crisp. very happy with this purchase and highly recommend. price point excellent as well for what you get."
1,Basically unlistenable,"I have all of The Vines work and generally buy it without hearing it because I consider them to be one of the better bands recording today. After Vision Valley, I will have to reconsider. I don't have a problem with the length of the songs or the album, as a whole, but the quality is lacking. If ""Spaceship"" had not made the album, there would be nothing redeeming about the album, whatsoever. None of the other tracks would even compete for space on either of the previous two albums. Its like an album of studio filler to keep the record exec.s happy.I wish all of them well, but in the unlikely event of another album I wouldn't buy it until I can preview it and see that they have returned to form."
5,The Vines-One not to miss out on,This cd is amazing! it incorporates grunge with beatlesque type music and no two songs on there are the same. There is also no song which cant be liked which is why it is a perfect buy!Dont miss out on this incredible album!Lauren
5,THE LEAD SINGER IS A GENIUS,"I want to remind reviewers that the talented lead singer of the Vines has a variety of autism called Asperger syndrome accounting for his sensitiveness to unpleasent noises and sorroundings.Back to this album,it is as good as 2002's HIGHLY EVOLVED and merits five stars.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
2,Come on people,"In the time it took me to read the reviews I just figured out half of this album out on guitar, and I'm not that great a guitar player. I know everyone wants to take the ""genius"" angle on this band because Craig Nicholls has a syndrome, but face the facts, this music isn't that great. Now don't get me wrong, I think every Vines album to date has a few very good studio tracks that are nice to listen to and seem to decrease in numbers per album, but the rest of the albums are very flat. Not to mention these guys couldn't recreate the sound on the albums live if they had to. For anyone to compare this band to The Strokes is laughable. Highly Evolved had a few good songs and piqued my interest, but I have been very disappointed since then. This album adds to that. I have no ill will towards this band and hope they do well, but there is better music out there people. Why waste your time? They were more interesting when they toured and he had meltdowns on stage."
1,Too many F bombs and fiddling about.,I have made it to 36% in this book. I hate that I spent my money to be reading so many F bombs and fiddling about. Please can we have ratings on the books.
4,Poignant,"The stories are heart-wrenching and touching but many are predictable. Women are wounded and strong and just about all of the men are awful. However, it's a good read and stays with the reader."
4,Wonderfull,Wonderfull short stories. But they kept you wanting more. I would like to see some of the stories made into a novel.
3,stories,It wasn't easy to read sometime I have to read twice specially the storie of Mr.With all the talent she have I hope her next book will be a novel.
3,"Blackberries, Blueberries",I liked this book. I chose it at random and am glad that I did. It gives a real view into the lives of the women involved.
5,Excellent,"Excellent, so here is 18 more words to fill out the requirement, I reviewed on the Clippers for everything involved!"
5,Bald fade,"Great for bald fades or all over bald head without cutting or bruising the scalp, leaves head feeling smooth and the blades stay cool and are easy to clean."
2,Certainly not the best of. Who picks these episodes anyway?,"If they took all of the really great episodes from the four ""best of"" videos, they could fit them all onto one video. But then, they wouldn't make so much money off us Friends fans, would they? The only reason to reach for this tape is for episode 1 (""The One Where No One's Ready""), episode 3 (""The One With Ross's Wedding"") and #5 (""The One Where Everybody Finds Out""). Episode #2 (""The One With the Embryos"") has got to be one of the most monotonous ever made. Episode #4 wears thin after the first few minutes. Not worth it in my opinion, but feel free to take your chances."
5,A Video Collecters Must Buy!,"Friends is just the thing you need after a stress filled day. The charecters are funny and the situations are hillarious. My personal favorite is the episod when Ross goes on a date wearing leather pants. The girls apartment is so hot, he goes to the bathrooom to take off the pants to get some air, then he can't get them back on. So, he calls Joey, (of all People) to help him figure out what to do because he's in the womens apartment. This entire tape will have you laughing form beginning to end."
3,Buy The Complete Season DVDs Instead!,Friends is a great sitcom but these Best Of Friends DVDs are just a selection of episodes I think it's kind of goofy to buy a DVD that only has a handful of best of episodes instead of buying the complete seasons on DVD where you get every single episode and the complete season DVD sets are nicely priced too. Not too expensive!
3,So no one told you life was gonna be this way...,"No jobs, great apartments, designer clothes, and an utter lack of minorities in the most populated U.S. city. These are a few of the recurring elements of the ten episodes compiled on this ""best of"" 2-disk set. Unfortunately, aside from the irritating card-board packaging, Warner is still displaying its knack for the DVD stone-age. Let's see, highlights include ""interactive menus"" and (gasp with joy) career highlights. As far as picture quality and sound go, well you know that neighbor that has a great home theater? His television showcases the repeats (which play all day) just as well as the DVDs present these episodes. The episodes, voted 10 favorite by fans (a vote I don't recall being invited to take part in), are all titled ""The one where..."" just to remind you that this show is hip with beautiful people and catchy themes. Overall, the disk offers little more than your local television station already provides for free."
3,"Okay, but still...","Finally, the best of ""Friends"" shows up in 2 videocassettes, but most of the ""Friends"" shows are sometimes stupid, mainly silly, but sometimes they manage to occasionally produce a good laugh, by using sex jokes and some body humor. But it has warmth and charm to it. Also, bubbly Lisa Kudrow, sex-crazed Matt LeBlanc, the two fiances (Matthew Perry and Courteney Cox Arquette), silly Ross, and just plain Jennifer Aniston are the oddballs in this genially entertaining sitcom, with entertaining appearances by Julia Roberts (I love that woman), George Clooney, and Helen Hunt (I love that sexy woman, too)."
3,"Americans, save your hard earned cash....","Finally! Friends on DVD?? Yes and No. in America yes, everywhere else, No. The only difference being that everywhere else has the full compilations and not just 'Best of..'Save your money buy going to a British DVD retailer such as www.amazon.co.uk and buy all 6 series of Friends on DVD without missing episodes. Or simply wait and hope they don't screw you over and eventually realise them in the US."
3,"good, but not nearly comprehensive...","these dvds provide a good overview of the series for newbie fans of the show. but for the more die-hard fans, these dvds lack a lot to be desired. for a comprehensive collection, check out the vcds. you can get complete seasons for not much more money."
2,Over-rated trash TV,"Friends is a popular show with young people around the world, yet anyone with a half decent sense of humour can see that this is pretty poor stuff. The lines are weak, the situations are too obvious to be remotely funny and the characters are so over the top it makes you sick. It's amazing that such a show could be spawned from what is argueably the greatest sitcom ever; Seinfeld. It's set in New York, it's centered around a coffee shop, and it tries so hard to be about ""nothing"", yet the difference here is that Friends fails to make ""nothing"" funny.The only hint of talent in the cast is in Lisa Kudrow's masterful flakieness, Pheobe. It's a sign of the times when a show like this can be considered ""Must See"" The young kiddies may keep watching while they'res nothing else on, but this won't go down as a classic, just something NBC cooked up to milk the Seinfeld bandwagon."
4,A good attempt to please Friends' collectors.,"It's hard to please everyone when you only pick up 10 episodes out of more than 100. This selection is great (but I wouldn't have included ""The one with the poker""). Are there any great episodes missing? Sure, just to name a few (I don't know the correct names, sorry): season finale 3 (on the beach house), season finale 5 (Las Vegas), the one where Rachel and Ross break up, and so on. It's quite probable that we'll get vols. 3 & 4 pretty soon.It's great to have these Friends DVD's, but they're not that good if you think they have released the whole series (6 seasons) in Europe & Australia."
1,Mark King,"My wife loves friends, so I bought her the Amazon double dvd version. I have no problem with content, but come on..its a high level VHS transfer..just do a freeze frame anywhere on the discs and enjoy the blur. Colors are vivid, but it is blurry for a dvd release, and poor product for the price. I A/B'ed the dvd with a broadcast rerun (on direct tv) and found the clarity to be inferior, in fact poor. A first run broadcast of a new episode puts this set to shame. Don't buy it. I want my money back. Mark King in Atlanta."
2,"Good Episodes, but already available","This set of Friends, has some of the best episodes like ""The one with two parts,"" but the only problem, Is your going to pay [$$$] for six episodes that are aready available in the Season 1 and 2 boxs sets. If you only want a few episodes this is the way to go, but your better off buying the full seasons."
2,Far from PERFECTION,"If you're a ""friends"" fan like I am, dont' get the ""Best of Friends""... In Europe, Japan, and Taiwan, a complete collection of every season, including every episode, is everywhere. That's what we call collection. I don't get why people in The States and Canada don't get to have equal access to those DVDs yet. There are only 6 or 7 episodes in each volume. I don't deny those are of the best ones. Yet to a fan, every episode is remarkable and thus shouldn't have ever been left out. If you get this two-volume DVD set, you're going to be trapped into the following situations: Where's the episode I miss the most? Or Where's the one I happened to miss because I was late that night when it was on TV? You don't want to be in such a scene, do you? So, here's the advice from someone who's been there: DON""t GET THEM. BE PATIENT. WAIT FOR THE COMPLETE COLLECTION TO BE RELEASED. However, if you just can't wait, the product may save your life for the time being."
5,They'll Be There For You,"Friends has been a television powerhouse since we first met the gang at Central Perk in 1994. It was obvious right from the beginning that these were people we were going to like and watch for years. It was also obvious that these actors were a strong bunch of people with instant charm and chemistry. This two volume collection contains some great episodes. You get the Pilot episode which, if you haven't seen lately, is a real hoot to see them looking so different. You get hilarious episodes like ""The One Where No One's Ready"", which is kind of seinfeldian in a way. But, the top episodes is ""The One With The Prom Video"". A classic!. These people really don't get enough credit. It's a shame. They have impeccable timing. It's always dead on and pitch perfect. This is a real treat for fans who want to own a bit of their favorite friends."
3,This isn't regular Cayenne it's a super HOT pepper,"I love Cayenne extract it does so many amazing things but this isn't regular cayenne it is a diiferent pepper and it is so HOT. My mouth was definately warm and eyes were watering. It still would work for warming you up, and stopping nose bleeds but unless you like super hot peppers I would look for the regular cayenne. Your mouth will thank you. I only gave it 3 stars because it is a bit misleading by calling it cayenne which is 40,000 HU when it is really habanero pepper which is 180,000 HU. Let me know if this helps."
5,"Clear, concise deep explanations with minimal math","I've recently had to obtain a broad background in material science, and this book was a wonderful introduction. Holden gives great physical explanations with a wide array of simple models that are tailored to give the insight necessary to understand diverse topics such as crystal structure and symmetry, electrical conductance and specific heat with nary an equation.I highly recommend this to anyone who wants good understanding of the different physics in solids without getting bogged down in the math. It was a wonderful introduction for me."
3,Good absorbency but I had trouble with the fit.,"This diaper has good absorbency but was not as soft as advertised, in fact I though the quilted absorbent lining was rather hard. My main complaint was that it did not fit that well around the waist. I think it needs and elastic waist band or three tapes for closure, as after wearing for a while it seemed to sag open a little at the waist."
4,Works as stated,Works well and suits needs of someone who doesn't drink too much and is only wearing it a few hours. May need several changes if worn overnight while sleeping. Delivery is fast and accurate; have been ordering this for over 6 months with no issues.
5,Really nice pop-up book,"This book was a big hit with my friend's son, who was turning two when I gave it to him. I thought the book would be destroyed, but I liked it so much I couldn't resist buying it. He treasured it, and wanted it read to him constantly for months. He's 3 1/2 now and hasn't torn it up yet. I ended up buying it for my nephew's second birthday, and he loves it too.It's well-made, not cheap like some popups. The happenings on the bus remind me a little of a Richard Scarry book in that you can spend ages looking at what everybody's doing. Most of the characters have tiny ongoing ""stories"" as the bus journey progresses."
5,the wheels on the busTHE WHEELS ON THE BUSTHE WHEELS ON THE,"THE WHEELS ON THE BUSI chose the book, The Wheels On The Bus, by Paulo Zelinsky, because it has bright colors, illustrations and activities. It is a book that is very easy to read because you already know the song. The Wheels On The Bus, published by Dutton Children&#65533;s Books, New York, is a book that children of the age s 2-5 would want to read every day. The most important reason I chose this book is, that I can read this book to my son, all the times he would wan, knowing it is an educational book for him."
5,"Finally, he'll let me read a whole book!!!",WONDERFUL!!! My son loves it!! We read it over and over again. The sub-plots are enjoyable too. Every parent who has a child who has a hard time sitting through a book should get this!
5,"Entertaining, has a hypnotic effect",A great book for children even younger than the recommended 4-8 years of age. My son enjoys watching the movement on the pages while I sing to him. A must have for a child's library.
5,A Special Treasure!!!!!!!!!!!!,This has been a favorite in our house for many years! Four children later we're about due for a third copy! My two year old loves to manipulate the doors and windows. The Mommies and the Babies are fun too! The artwork is beautiful! A special treasure that we love to give as a gift!
5,"Engaging, beautiful, clever book","My grandchild has known the ""wheels on the bus"" song since she was a baby. Now 2 1/2 I bought her this book because of that and because I know Paul Zelinsky's work. She absolutely loves it. It is clever and interactive, colorful and wonderful and fun."
5,Every child has to have this book!,I got this book originally as a baby shower book for my first son. He has loved this book since he was old enough to focus. He still loves it. And even better is that there is a story within a story through the pictures. Every child should have this book!
5,The Wheels on the Bus,"My one year old son LOVES this book! He says "" shhh shhh shhh"" (wipers on the bus) when he wants me to read it to him."
2,The Wheels on the Bus,"Too fragile and difficult to operate for little hands. This will take adult supervision for a long time to come! For the money, I wish I had chosen something else more durable."
5,The BEST pop-up book you've ever seen,"I first bought this book when my now 10-year-old son was a toddler, and that copy is now an absolute rag. I'm so glad to see it here at Amazon, because I haven't been able to locate it anywhere else. This book is the best popup I've ever seen. It is illustrated with tremendous charm and humor, with new story lines to discover on every page. You'll love it, and it's a good thing, because your child will want to read it over and over and over and over....The babies going ""wah wah wah"" were a hoot, as were their mothers going ""shh shh shh."" It's a must for your library"
5,Fantastic!,"I first bought this book when my older son, who is now 12, was a toddler. Although it has many moving parts (all great fun), it lasted through his brother's use as well. I have since bought it for several nieces and nephews as a gift for each one's 2nd birthday. All of them have loved it, and read it for many years. The story is true to the song, but the illustrations have small side stories running through them, allowing older children to enjoy as well. Definitely a great purchase!"
5,The Wheels on the Bus,"My sister, a 21 year kindergarten teacher, recommended this book as one she had used in her class for many years. Hers was very lovingly used...parts didn't work anymore, so I ordered her one, my grandchildren one and several others for babies due soon. The colors and movement are wonderful. I have never seen such an unusual version of the book as this one. It is the best!"
5,"Since 10 months our little boy has loved it, he is now 14 months and is still one of his favourites! Sydney - Australia","This is a beautifully illustrated book. The moving parts capture young children's / toddlers imaginations along to the tune of ""the wheels on the bus...go round and round"". The illustrations are full of wonderful images which seem to spring up with new surprises every time...absolutely recommend this book!"
5,As expected,The Basic Techniques for Working with Steel (DVD) came on time for Christmas gift and is what the recipient had asked for.
3,Poor quality video but good instruction,"This video is a bit outdated considering the price. It would be a good deal for around 20 dollars. The quality of the video is poor. It looks like it was shot in the late 80's to early 90's but it's good enough that it gets the point across. The instructions and techniques that Ron uses in the video are excellent and anybody wanting to get better at sheet metal finish would probably benefit from watching this. It's a good video if you really want to learn but don't buy it thinking that your going to be entertained. This isn't the oc chopper drama crap, its pure instruction from a guy that really know his stuff."
5,I love this show,I love this show its so funny I hate it was taken off tv but its good to know i can watch it on my kindle
5,"Excellent content, very focused and informative.","This book is a must read for anybody entering the music business, whether at the superstar level or in your home studio. It has everything you need to get started and not ripped off, from copies of record contracts to getting label artwork. Not only is this book focused and informative, it is also written in easy to understand laguage."
3,The Minutemens worst album still has it's charms,"Despite the 5 covers, slower tempos and for the Minutemen much more conventional and longer songs, 3-Way Tie For Last is a good album. Unfortunately it's the Minutemen's last official album being released just before D. Boon's untimely death and isn't a very good swansong. One wonders what direction this odd and intelligent band would have taken had D. lived. Because this album doen'st really point in any one direction. It's somewhat scattershot and unfocused with moments of brilliance interspersed with moments of boredom and self-indulgence. I wouldn't start here if you are new to the Minutemen. Rather you should start at the magnificent What Makes a Man Start Fires? or their masterpiece Double Nickels On The Dime which is a five star album if ever I've heard one."
1,god awful,"If you turned on to the Minutemen after listening to Buzz or Howl... or What Makes a Man Start Fires, the dull, pseudo Creedence on display here will make you wonder how they could go so far wrong in just a few short years. If you're new to the Minutemen, don't waste your ears on this total turkey. Start with Buzz or Howl--amazing record."
3,Ok book,"Unfortunately, Punjabi is lacking in instructional resources and what it does have is not the best. I come from a Punjabi speaking family, and this book does an OK job as an introduction, however I did not like the English script transliterations provided because it was harder to follow (following Gurmukhi is easier). I wish the author had included more vocabulary for more advanced students and also said more on the Shahmukhi script (used in Pakistan). The Teach Yourself Panjabi is a good source because it provides Punjabi in Gurumukhi as well as in the English Script and also has a good dictionary. If you are a serious learner of Punjabi, it is good to get idea to explore some of the more colloquial speech (not as a beginner though...way to confusing), so try Cummings ""Panjabi Guide."" It is hard to find though...try Interlibrary loan."
1,Unsafe!!!,The car seat fell off the base twice. I bought this for my husband because it was black. We ended up buying an extra base for our Chicco travel system. The two just don't compare.
1,Straps too short even for premie,My son outgrew this car seat by the time he reached 14 pounds. What a waste. We only had the car seat for 5 weeks before it became unusable. The problem is that the straps are too short. The base is designed in a way that makes the seat very unstable.
1,VERY DANGEROUS!,"My son tipped over in this carseat! It is not safe at all!! PLEASE don't risk your infant's life! It should be recalled, it's so unsafe.I returned mine without a receipt or the box, you can too!I exchanged it for the GRACO snugride. It's great, and way lighter!PS. and it doesn't fit in a standard shopping cart! It's awful!!!"
1,Eddie Baur Infant Car Seat,"I too was a victim of this car seat, the base does not install properly it can not tighten enough to hold it securely. Also the car seat itself was a lot heavier than other infant car seats which was difficult for me to carry my infant around and finally since I couldn't use the base, I was supposed to use the shoulder belt method to secure it but my seat belt wasn't long enought to reach around the car seat so I couldn't properly use it. I called the manufacturer on the back since Toy's R Us wouldn't return the car seat and they sent me out shipping labels to send back and sent me a new style of car seat."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAR SEAT,"mine will not stay in one place unless I make both front seats hold the car seat in place. Then one screw fell out on my son's body. Thank God I was there when it happened. I rescrewed it in, then it fell right back on him. This time I caught him trying to eat it! The next day another fell out. I'm going to call that number that was on one of the reviews to see about getting my money back or something. I bought this with the stroller thinking its eddie bauer it has to be good. With both items I spent over 200 dollars. I already tried to take it back to babies r us. Which they would not do nothing for! I will never shop at babies r us again because of the way they treated me!!!Please do not buy this item. You will be paying too much money for junk that can hurt your baby..."
4,speechless explains it best!,"Richey is an awesome guitarist !!! Just wish this CD had some singing on it. Every song started to sound alike.. I'll see her live next week, and look forwards to it."
3,Comprehensive but Difficult,"This book is pretty darn comprehensive, especially for something of its size. It wastes no time getting right to the nitty-gritty about the language, but in order to fit so much information into the space available, it's very technical and hard to follow at times. The lessons are best taken in small doses to reduce frustration. Overall it's a pretty decent book, but I would seriously recommend having already learned another (preferably European) language. This book says it's for beginners, but it helps to be familiar with learning another language to make the lessons easier to follow."
2,This is an old Edition !!!,"Do not buy the 1999 edition. There is a Fourth Edition, published 2003 available."
1,RIP OFF!!!,"Do not Order from this Company if you live in HAWAII or ALASKA!! Without looking at the rates for shipping, you WILL get RIPPED off!! I live in Hawaii, and it cost me more to ship ($32.00) than the shirt itself!! Hawaii and Alaska have the same USPS rates, so charging that much is REDICULOUS!!!"
5,Jon Butcher Axis Where are you?!!(Life Takes a Life),"In 1983 I bought a cassette tape of Jon Butcher Axis self titled album. It included ""Life Takes a Life"", ""Ocean in Motion"",""Can't Be the Only Fool"", ""Walk Like This"", among others. I wore out the tape in no time, but when I looked for it again it was out of print. I've listened to other Butcher albums, but none have reached the quality of this album. While looking through used tapes in a half price bookstore, I found the tape! It wasn't in very good shape, but I was able to find some people who did a pro job of bringing it back to life. A good friend was able to burn it on a CD, thus, it was reborn. If you find this album latch onto it, it is, indeed, a true musical experience."
3,A collection of samples,"I heard one track on an internet radio station and I had to find the track. The cover of Red House is what I bought this disc for. I have one other JBA cd which is fine. For me this one is a collection of tracks which are cut off in their prime. Some I wonder why they have been put on the disc, (though the sleeve notes explain why). Treat this as a sampler and you will be fine with it."
4,good record,"Yup, its a good record. Better than most, not as good as some. If you like this, I suggest you check out some other bands as well. Some of them are pretty good also."
5,grows on you,"I bought this when it came out, my sophomore year of high school, on the basis of reviews only. Brought it home and found it way too noisy for my tastes. Now, 25 years later, I could listen to it every day. I Apologize and Books about UFOs gradually sucked me in."
4,Nice album tracks by Al,"Amazon lists two versions of this release (1996 & 1998), but both have the same 18 songs. My copy shows a 1995 release date. Al's charting hits are available on many reissues, but his album tracks are harder to find. This release has some very nice songs from the following albums: ""Painted, Tainted Rose""-1963, ""Living A Lie""-1964, ""My Cherie""-1965, ""This is Love""-1966, ""This Love For You""-1967, ""Daddy's Little Girl""-1967 and ""This Is Al Martino""-1968. Several people have written very comprehensive reviews of the songs included on this CD so if you want more details, see the 1998 listing for this same album. While there are a lot of his songs that I like better, this is a fine collection of the type of music he did best. Since this is a release by his label, Capitol, you get a well written book with details about his career. Unless you only want his hits, this is a very good choice with some fine singing by Mr. Martino."
4,Paladin 4370 tool kit.,"This was a gift to my nephew, so I'm only giving you my input to this product on what heard I from him.My nephew thought the quality and variety of the tools, along with the carrying case was the right combination."
3,Kind of messy...,"The flavor of this tea is good, and it is well priced.However I am irritated by the way the tea is packaged. There is a lot of loose tea floating around the box and the tea bags seem to fall apart when you are ""steeping"" the tea. Tea particles end up in the bottom of your glass/pitcher, which isn't very tasty."
1,Awful Tea,Oolong is one of my favorite teas. When I saw the chance to buy it organic I was very interested. The farily good recommendations sold me on it to the point that to save on shipping I purchased 200 bags. It does not taste anything like the Oolong I am used to drinking at Chinese restuarants and other brands that are much tastier and aromatic. The aroma is off for Oolong and the tea tastes like hot water with an off taste.Using two bags to a cup doesn't help. The other folks giving this tea high marks obviously never had Oolong tea before.
3,Pleasant Tea,The tea was inexpensive and goes down easy. It is suppose to be for weight loss but I really have not had any effect. They could work on the taste by adding lemon or some other spice. I don't feel bloated or anything and it goes down smooth. I got it to get off diet pop and I have not returned to the diet pop so it seems to be working in that area. I don't know all the medicinal purposes but it has no bad side effects.
3,A solid value,"The box set for Chaplin: An Artist in his Prime represents a solid value for the price. Collected together on 3 DVDs are 9 separate titles, including such greats as ""The Gold Ruch"", ""The Cure"" and ""The Kid"".The picture quality for the 9 titles varies slightly, however they are all much improved over ealier versions available on video.One striking drawback to this DVD collection is that source Koch Vision used for ""The Gold Rush"" is different than what was available on video tape years ago. As well as missing all the descriptive dialog screens, the film also omits two key sequences: The Death of Black Larson, and the last shot in the movie where Chaplin and Georgia kiss."
4,I am a major Chaplin fan,"I was impressed with the picture quality overall, however what infuriated me was how the makers of this set made the claim that the music in the films was Chaplin's. It was NOT, and yet the titles clearly stated that it was. His music was far, far superior to the music on these DVDs. His music fit the atmosphere of the movies much better. AND, I was also infuritated that they used the 1942 print of Chaplin's reissue of The Gold Rush, but they did not include his narration. Thus, there are no dialogue titles, as someone else noted, for the simple reason that in the 1942 version, Chaplin spoke the narration himself. ..."
3,koch- chaplin-artist in his prime 1918-1923-3 dvd set,"the people at KOCHVISION may not be sticklers for accuracy, but this 3 dvd set is pretty good for the price. most of the films are good quality and the music is good too if you dont mind hearing the same music throughout all 3 discs. the big disapointment here is the GOLD RUSH, which is a copy of the later release which should have narration by chaplin, but does not. Buy that one from Image Entertainment & you will not be let down. This is not a collection for true Chaplin fans but it is a decent set for those who dont want to pay outrageous prices for the same movies, or to just watch an occasional chaplin film."
2,Mediocre book creates a foggy picture,"What striked me as odd in this book is the background of it's author: Medicine and IT.My skepticism unfortunatelly proves well founded.The book is built around a quite simplified example of a bike shop that fails to clear things up.The writer spends much time explaining technological advances in broad terms and less time with the marketing aspect of CRM.It contains no case studies.Too introductory.It will give you some understanding of CRM but limited.All in all i did not find it a helpfull book on the subject .Only for execs with no touch with current technologies as a starting point, not good from a marketing perspective."
3,Very High Level,"It was a pretty good book, but it was a little too high level. If you are new to CRM this book is pretty good, but if you have picked anything up from the various business magazines then it is not as useful. I would have liked to see more specifics discussed regarding implementations and possible pitfalls."
3,OK,"These are really beautiful Nude Brown shades: a light beige (good for highlighting below the brow), a slightly shimmery beige, a medium brown and a darker brown (a little goes a very long way with the darker brown). This would be my perfect eye color palatte (the brown really makes my blue eyes pop), but unfortunately, halfway through the day half of the eyeshadow has migrated to the crease of my eye, and while trying to rub it back into my lid I end up with more on my finger than on my eyelids.Overall, beautiful colors, I like that you can use your fingers, but the lack of staying power makes it only good for times when I only need my makeup to stay for an hour or two."
5,nice product,"I must have a dozen sets of these eyeshadows, I love the texture and colors of them. They apply nice and smoothly and if you have issues with it creasing, just dust your lids with powder base first."
3,Could have had more ideas....,"Like the previous reviewer Amy, I did the same thing as she did.In other words, I fell in love with some of the photos, and bought this book . It did not cost much so I was not thoroughly disappointed. But had I spent more, I would have been a bit more disappointed.I normally love the BETTER HOMES books. As all the BETTER HOMES books go, they are normally filled with great photos---as this one is also. However, the title is misleading because there were not enough ""budget ideas"" for the reader.Don`t take me wrong, the photos are great, but the ideas themselves are not applicable to a person trying to decorate on a ""budget""."
3,"Not for the budget, but has great ideas.","If you are looking to work within a bidget, then this book just might take you beyond your limit. At least, I should say, on some of the projects. But then it is hard to find a good book that will help you with good, practical ideas that will also give fine style advice. They do have some wonderful ideas, color palates and helpful tools to crate the looks. I think BHG books sometimes are a little overdone, but most are pleasing. Give the book a try if you are looking for new ideas. This will definitely help."
5,A Favorite Imagination Builder!,"I teach kindergarten and my students have always loved this book. I usually let a child hold a red crayon while I read the story, and they look at the crayon with increasing wonder as the story unfolds. Crayons and imagination can be so magical! This is a wonderful book, especially for little boys."
2,More expensive than informative.,"Weather and energy derivatives constitute a 'hot' topic in the derivatives market with new articles, reviews and websites sprouting everywhere. So, this book may seem a timely publication on the topic, given the fact that there are very few publications available on this topic.However, unless you know nothing about the subject, I do not recommend to buy this book: timeliness seems to be its only quality.Most articles are descriptive of products and markets and contain little information of interest to risk managers / traders / insurance professionals working in the field. The article on options is a general article on Black Scholes with little or no relevance to energy or weather derivatives.In brief, it looks as if this book were written for purely commercial purposes. Definitely not worth its high price."
3,A good basic text on insurance and weather derivatives,"There are only four chapters on weather derivatives themselves and these seem, at a glance, to be mainly re-writes of material that is already available on the internet, e.g. one written by Enron, one by Southern Company Energy Marketing.Nevertheless, the contributors are key players in the market and this book serves as a useful summary of the available literature. I would have liked to see some advanced material, including explanation of more sophisticated pricing models, but that is perhaps best left to a subsequent text.The book is certainly not cheap, though it is not unreasonably priced - especially when compared to the amount of money companies are throwing away through failing to manage their weather risks..."
5,Another great dvd! Which has helped me !,"Another very good informative dvd from Mel,he explains things with so much ease and passion.Very good for people who have a problem with their fly casting or people that are involed in fly casting tuition. This dvd will help most people understand what they are doing incorectly when they are having a problem with certain casts.It has help me allot with explaing casting faults to some of my clients. I would reckomend buying this dvd."
5,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable book. The publisher's weekly reviewer's criticism is misdirected. I guarantee that you will enjoy this book, and annoy the hell out of your friends/family quoting them little tidbits. I particularly enjoyed the author's discussion of the design of experiments, in his lab and in the lab's of other scientists, for various purposes. Highly recommended."
2,Like a rock,"After buying this pillow, I bought the real tempurpedic pillows. This is very uncomfortable because the pillow does not compress, causing neck aches."
1,Buy it for the laughs!,"I've got an edition of this book that advocates taking a plastic drinking straw and jamming it into the heart. Seriously.How about removing the light cover from the indoor dome light of your car? Jam that into your attacker!This is by far one of the worst self defense books every written. For that reason alone, it's worth looking at. It's so bad it's hysterically funny.Now I'm sending one of my martial arts students over to McDonald's to get drinking straws. That's my theme for today's class."
5,Good,It is a good product...........I am pleased with it..........and I'll be more pleased as I learn how to do it.
2,the first one's better,"October Faction aren't for everyone, that's for sure. This cd isn't all that great(mojo magazine in an article about SST compared its interest to watching grass grow). The first October Faction record, recorded live opening for Black Flag I believe, is actually pretty good though. I'd suggest getting that cd and then if you really like it, then think about getting this one."
2,Not the most interesting,I didn't really like the book and the author seems to reiterate information from her different books into others. I had just borrowed the book from the library as well as the book on Grace Kelly and neither this or the book on Grace had any pictures to speak of and any author who cannot be resourceful enough to get pictures to include in the biography is lazy or did not try hard enough...others have been able to so why can't she? So you definitely can't say I am her biggest fan.
5,Quick,I got this book very quickly which I appreciated because I am a student and needed the book for an upcoming class.
5,Blackthorn does it again ...,"The lads from Philly & Ireland have done it again. Although I have long been waiting for the new release, I was apprehensive that they wouldn't be able to top their spectacular original debut, The Other Side. But the boys have proven me wrong - quite simply, this album is fantastic.From Moore's magical storytelling, to the Boyce Brothers' pop/country tunes, McGroary's reels, Seamus Kelleher's' electrifying guitar work and Mike O'Callaghan keeping the beat (and writing a new tune), this record does not have a single weak spot on it. Personally, I have always been a huge fan of Paul Moore's songwriting, but there are no slouches in this band.Very highly recommended for fans of Celtic music, pop music and/or country music. And if you can, catch the boys live - it's something to see."
2,FMG starting residency,I feel that this book can not be much of use to international medical graduates. Most of the information is for US medical students. Most of the information can be found on the web free of cost. Only portion of the book that I liked was the interview part. I was disappointed.
3,Good book but lot of information can be found on the web,"I have bought this book after seeing very good reviews on this book. This book has lot of information. I can say too much information. Much of the information can be found on USMLE, ECFMG, FREIDA and other websites. The author has made the book bulky by including the material you can access on the web. The author must have described it in brief and provided links for the relevant websites. There is indeed very important information right from selecting a field to interview for residency. But it is interspersed with lot of junk, making it difficult to find it out. On the whole it is a good book, but not a great one as described by some of the reviewers. It requires a lot of editing. I feel it is a lot of money for free information. I think the authors and publishers will keep this in mind in their future editions."
1,Great expectation - great disappointment,"I found that only about 25% of the material is useful. Rest is trash- The material you can find for free on the internet. Cost is too much for the material. My sincere advise, do not waste money purchasing it. You can borrow it from a public library, go through it and make notes of information that you may find useful. That is what I did."
5,Phoebe......no one more original!,Ms Snow is by far still the most orginal female voice recorded in music. Her seemingly halting yet smooth transitioning singing style has never been imitated or duplicated by any other singer to my knowledge. She is a great artist and this album is one of her best efforts. A great treasure in the world of music!
5,A Timeless Gem,"I've had this CD awhile (first owned as a cassette) and played it often for years. In going through my music to see what treasures are so essential that they must be replaced, this was way high on the list. (So was another of the incomparable Snow's work, Something Real.)Snow's VOICE is impossible to easily characterize, so I won't try. But she is, simply put, a unique and brilliant interpreter of songs, not a mere singer. Whatever the emotion of the song, she captures it completely and conveys it so intensely that you experience it as your own.That is artistry."
5,I've known her for years,"Back in the mid seventies, a small group of us went to the Tower Theater in Phila to hear Jackson Brown perform. An unknown girl named Phoebe Snow did the lead in set, and to this day, she is embeded in the hearts of the five of us who traveled there together that night.Phoebe's music touches your soul. She lullabys you, comforts you, serenades you or if you want, perks you up. Her music is just as fitting during the evening, as it is the morning after. In my mind, Phoebe and the late Laura Nyro are in a class by themselves.'Phoebe Snow' is one of the only two LP's that I ever physically wore out, so I feel I can say 'I've known her for years'."
1,WARNING! This is not the original MMO album!,"This is a completely different album from the original Philips PHS 600-277 which had Music by Simon & Garfunkel, Gordon Lightfoot and was performed by such artists as Larry Bunker, Bud Shank and a marvelous Moog peformance by Paul Beaver.This has no cover art on the listing here..it is no wonder, because this is NOT the ""Emotions"" LP I cherish so much, after decades of listening to the original lp and hoping it had finally been released as a CD...it WAS NOT! You might enjoy this, but missing the ""Emotions"" version of Soldier in the rain is tragic!"
3,"""In My Head""","One of the better post-Damaged LP's. It has some of the old Black Flag elements, though some tracks are slower and more ""musical"". Definitely one to play very loud. Check out tracks 6 and 8-11."
3,Not one of their strongest releases,"As a Black Flag fan I want to like this, but it's just one of their weakest efforts.The production is not very good. The guitars are too loud and when Greg Ginn does overdubs for solos the bass becomes almost non-existent. Performances sound strangely perfunctory and isolated and the vocals are too low in the mix.Some of these lyrics are just painfully adolescent as well, ""Got myself in trouble,Really burst their bubble..."" Yeesh.Honestly, I would probably sell my copy, but I like the Pettibon art included."
5,Probably their most Underrated Album,A lot of people that like early Black Flag don't like their later stuff but I don't consider myself among that number. I love how Greg Ginns guitar sound evolved into a heavy sludgy jazz fusion mish mash. Also the weird esoteric paranoia infested direction that the lyrics took on the later albums as opposed to the more direct in your face paranoia of the early albums were much to my liking. I bought this album in the mid 80s and still listen to it on occasion and it stands the test of time as well as any of the other Black Flag albums. In My Head is probably their most underrated album.
4,good album,This a good album by Hank he should do more albums like this he seemed like he tried on this one good Traditional Country songs and a great singing by Hank. This album is out of print but real Hank fans should seek it out.
4,MacDrive 6,"Purchased this software in order to access Mac files on my PC. Easy to install, intuitive to operate and functioned as advertised."
4,A great beginning....,"My favorite series. I funny begining, but the characters really start to develop in season 2."
1,best friends,"the dvd's you sold me were all not working on my dvd player, they only work on my computer, and that is not a good review for your service."
2,Black Flag at their peak? Ha!,"I knew I was in for a below par album from the first song, ""The Process of Weeding Out."" This song seems nothing more than Greg Ginn going off on a tangent of guitar [self-gratification]. But if the title of said song is the actual purpose of said song, then I suppose it did it's job. The rest of the album is not as tedious as the first song, however, that does not say a whole lot. The album, as a whole, sounds weak; some of the songs are too long, some of the songs are too slow, some of the songs are too long and too slow (""The Process of Weeding Out"" comes to mind), and some of the songs just don't hit as hard as they should. There are good moments, it IS a Black Flag album, but all and all, I was thoroughly bored throughout the length of this album."
5,This CD makes me want to break things... in a good way.,"I know a lot of the punkers don't like Flag's post-Damaged material, maybe because it's not as political and doesn't have enough power chords and catchy chorus hooks, but this is an album more for music fans than punks.Greg Ginn was and is an underestimated guitarist. His proficiency is much more evident here than on any of Black Flag's post-Damaged studio recordings, which seem contrived and have a deflated sound quality that fails to capture the band's intensity. This is, like people always say, Black Flag at their peak."
4,Unusual Book on Missouri History,This book could be read over and over. The illustrations are unique. Anyone interested in the history of the Civil War in Missouri should have a copy.
3,Disappointed...but glad I was to be.,"I enjoyed the first half of the book and was thoroughly engaged by the storyline and plot (or lack thereof). It reminded me of M. John Harrison's The Course of the Heart, in that the story was about the results of an unexplainable, traumatic, perhaps supernatural experience. However, despite the fact that I think Mr. Hirschberg is so talented a writer and destined to be one of the best horror writers of all time, the payoff never came. I wasn't sure where the main character's search was going to lead him, but I was disappointed when, to me at least, it didn't really go anywhere. There was no redemption. If there was, then perhaps I didn't read closely enough. So the disappointment was perhaps my own fault, but, still, Mr. Hirschberg is an exceptional writer and seems to be one of the few to infuse a new technique into the genre...one that is desperately needed. He's not the only one of course."
1,Do not waste your time.....,"I do not understand all of the raves for this book!!! This book clearly had minimal action to it to keep the reader interested. To be honest, the book has 322 pages (hardcover) and I stopped at 301!! I had had enough of this awful novel...I had a very hard time reading as much of it as I did. I found this book to be not only BORING, but I also found it to be a bit contrived and plain out weird!!! I did not feel anything for these characters on these pages...I did not feel the victims or their families plight for what they went through during these times. I do not care if I see another Hirshberg novel on the shelf...if I do, I will run the other way!!!! First book that I believe that I gave a 1 star to...hopefully it will be the last...."
4,A Promising Debut,"Here is a haunting tale masterfully woven together through the alternate use of flashback and present time. Stark imagery pervades this novel, creating a surreal atmosphere, serving to enhance the novel's eerie plot. The main focus here is not on The Snowman, a mysterious serial killer of children. Although The Snowman lurks insidiously in the background and the reader is introduced to several of his victims, the story revolves mainly around three childhood friends (Mattie, Spencer, and Theresa). It is Theresa's decline into ever worsening mental illness that frames the premise of the story. The boys' disastrous attempt to save their friend has horrible consequences for the people around them. Mattie's despair and frustration over his failure seventeen years in the past leads him back to Detroit to reconcile himself. The story is told from his perspective. I believe this is a novel you will not soon forget."
3,HIGH RISE HORROR,"You know right from the start what this movie's twist is, so you just go along wondering when our heroine wakes up and smells the ectoplasm.Ostensibly a ghost story, the movie is actually a study in choices--what would happen if we made different choices and how those choices affect others.While CIRCLE OF EIGHT is nothing special, it managed to hold my attention without ticking me off. Perpetual nerd DJ Qualls has a small role and once again sets the standard for quirky actors.Should please GHOST WHISPERER devotees."
1,Circle of Eight,"Mountain Dew Makes Films? This was a boring and very Predictable movie,it tries to be stylish and many other things,It tries to be romantic while Mysterious.At Least there was only one Mountain Dew Appearance though."
2,Weak,"Of note only for the TED Klein tale, and ""Last Feast of Harlequin"" but these two tales have improved in far superior short story collections than this one."
4,Balance and Lucy's Definition of Contact,"Lucy Rees goes into a discussion about balance and ""true"" contact. Providing plenty of photographs, drawings and discussion about her philosophy comparing the positions of a horse standing and at large; and how the position of the Rider during such is paramount to True Centered and Balanced Riding in order that both Horse and Rider maintain optimum contact at all times. A Very Interesting Study with lots of explanation and in terms clear for the beginning horse enthusiast. I recommend this book for every library."
2,Oooh what a stinker..,"I reluctantly write this review, because I love everything else Tom Rapp has put out. On this record however, beautiful songs from the past get butchered. All the mystique that made e.g.'The Use of Ashes' so special becomes undone in these remakes. It hurts most when 'Snow Queen', once so fragile, is put on a rocking horse. The best thing about 'Familiar Songs' is the cover art, which led one to hope for another purse of pearls. Unfortunately, the music sits like an alien hybrid in the jacket - this album should've been called 'Familiar Jacket'. Tom's liner notes explain a lot, and I'm very appreciative of his decision to give the 'go ahead' on the re-release of this tainted album: it's such a notoriously twisted affair it had to see the light of day again sooner or later. So, with all due respect: for completists only - and I'm one of them."
3,Who's Got The 10 1/2?,"This LP would have been good. It had a good drum and bass and vocal sound, but it was severly lacking in a good guitar sound--almost like there was no distortion. 'Louie' sounded good without it, but not tracks like 'I'm The One' or 'Loose Nut'. And the dragged out 'Slip It In/Gimmie' sort of ruined those two classics. At least the songs themselves are good, but I'd still pass on this one. 3 stars."
2,Tedious,"I'm a Papp fan, so I was really disappointed in this disc, with its relentless ""getty-up, getty-up, getty-up"" beat, and its tired disco themes. I realize 70's disco is getting re-hashed as a club music standard, woven into house music, with all the bells-n-whistles, and pleading vocals. Why? House music is not supposed to be clever/cute...This CD is one that might keep a party going -- after the crowd has been sufficiently ""lubricated"" -- but there's just nothing here that grabs me. The mixing is flawless, but song choice is annoying. Especially track 7 ""Back Together"" by Hardsoul feat. Ron Carroll. The singer's voice is hard on the ears. At one point he delivers a high-pitched moan over and over again. And this is a ""club favorite""??This CD is out of my rotation instantly. If you're into this house-goes-disco stuff, Soulfuric In the House is far better..."
2,BUZZING NOISE !!!,"Overall, I really like this phone - great features, etc. However, like some of the other reviewers who've posted here, my phone began buzzing almost immediately- so badly that I couldn't hear the person on the other end (they could hear me fine). Since I have digital phone service connected to my DSL modem, I followed the owner's manual tip and bought a noise filter. This worked fine for about a week, then the buzzing returned. I bought another filter, thinking the first one had crapped out, but the buzzing persisted. I even had a technician from the cable company come out to check their equipment, which was in perfect working order. I was assured by the cable company that their system would support this phone. SO..... after much frustration, I'm returning this to Amazon today (luckily, it hasn't been 30 days since delivery yet). BEWARE WHEN CONSIDERING BUYING THIS UNIT!!!"
1,BUZZING phones!,"At first I thought this phone had everything - and it is loaded with features, and has a good range. However, after using it for about 5 weeks, I now have a very, very loud buzzing noise on all the handsets - it appears to come from the base and it is so loud I can barely hear the caller. I have tested this base on other jacks (still same problem) and I have tested other cordless phones from the existing jack, and they work fine with no buzz. I'm convinced it is in the base unit of the Panasonic phone. But after multiple email customer service attempts at Panazonic, I have not yet heard anything from this company. I'm scrapping the phone and buying a much cheaper, but more highly rated AT&T."
1,Not very good,"I have had these phones for a week now and at first they worked great and one week later you can hardly hear the person on the other end. This is my second set, I returned the first set for the same problem n hopes that it was just bad phones, but the second set is just as horrible... Dont waist your money.."
4,Panasonic cordless phone 3 handsets,"This cordless phone has the best reception of any cordless telephone we have previously owned so far. We like the feature of conference calling between three handsets. The paging option for the handsets is another great feature, to page another handset during a call to include another person in the conversation or to contact another person near one of the other handsets instead of yelling down the stairs. The flashing lighted ring around the top of the antenna makes it convenient to locate the handset in the dark when you are receiving a call."
1,Didnt last,"It worked great for the first few months but as we are nearing the 4th month, I'm so exasperated! A previous Panasonic cordless phone I had was muffled for the person I was talking to. Apparently with this phone, they can hear my clearly but I can barely hear a word they are saying! Sometimes it is really hard to hear, and other times, it is downright impossible. Either way: TERRIBLE!! It is like having your TV on volume setting 1. You can hear there is some kind of faint noise...but you just cant make out anything being said."
2,Low Sound Volume - as Reported by Other Reviewers,"We have always considered Panasonic phones, and their other gear to be first rate, but the volume on these phones, even with all possible boost applied, is much too low. Other reviewers on the Target website have noted the same. We've returned them for a set of well-rated Uniden phones from Amazon and are hoping for better results. It's good that Amazon has a fair return policy that makes this kind of disappointment less annoying."
1,Definitely Not Satisfied,Where to begin... Very difficult to hear - even when the receiver is placed squarely on the ear. Missed call feature does not account for calls received on any of the other handsets. Programming is not as easy as many other brands. Those are just a few of my concerns. I'll pick a Uniden model next time!
2,Disappointing!,"This phone has it all as far as features - as long as you don't want to actually hear the people you're talking to! Worked good for about a week and then couldn't hear anyone. Buzzing and sounded like people were standing next to an electric tower. I tried several ways to fix the problem. Once I went back to my Uniden 2.4 Ghz, I could hear great. Save your money!"
2,sound quality stinks,lots of good features.unfortunatly the most important feature of a phone is clarity and this phone system does not deliver.Hard to hear your conversations.
2,Typical Panasonic,"This phonePanasonic KX-TG5623B Black 5.8 GHz FHSS GigaRange Digital Cordless Telephone with Three Handsetsinitially worked well. However, when the battery needed replacing, Panasonic no longer supported the product and the handset became useless. You cannot add additional handsets to this phone. I would not purchse this phone again."
1,Too many failures - Can't recommend,"We purchased these phones on the obvious feature of having 3 related but separate phones and chargers. The sound quality was not the best, but acceptable, especially if you use the feature to brighten the voice quality. Within 3 months, the base station unit died. We sent them in for warranty work, and were surprised to get back refurbished units.We did not like it but figured, what the heck, given that the turn-around time for replacement was less than two weeks.We are now about 9 months from that replacement, and the base unit has begun to malfunction. People call and can't hear us. We can't dial out, etc.I am scrapping these, and returning to good old corded units that I can count on the performance and quality."
2,what's the quantity for $4.99?,can they really be selling just one for $5.00? That's not a convenience but rather highway robbery. My God man that translates to $60.00 to replace the 12 bolts needed. The rating is more on the price than the quality of the product.
5,WE HAVE TO HAVE IT ON VHS AND DVD !,"Like everyone else, I was in hysterics when I first watched The Osbournes. When I saw the show advertised I honestly thought I would never watch it. However I was flicking through the music channels and came on to MTV just after the show started. From that moment on I was hooked and taped every episode !!! Now I'm a huge fan of the whole family and would LOVE to spend a week with them because they are fantastic! Let's hope they go ahead and bring them to VHS and DVD! .......... ROCK AND ROLL!"
1,Why Not to Buy This Book,"My son is 8 years old and loves dinosaurs. He found many mistakes in this book. For example, the largest dinosaur is incorrect, many of the pictures show dinosaurs with horns that did not have them, and the descriptions of many of the dinosaurs are inaccurate. This book was not well researched. My son's quote is ""it should be considered nonfiction."""
2,Pretty pictures but bad science.,"At first glance this appears to be a great book for introducing youngsters to the subject of dinosaurs. Although the book does have nice illustrations and a recent publication date (1998), I would caution against buying this book for your kids. The last chapter (page), entitled 'Bye Bye Dinosaurs', is poorly researched. Even though the book claims to have used a 'technical consultant', the author writes that the dinosaurs died mysteriously (maybe it was a change in climate or habitat she suggests). This is a very poor statement. Very few scientists would deny the fact that a large comet (or asteroid) collided with the Earth 65 million years ago. Most believe that the result was the extinction of many species including the dinosaurs. Since I am against teaching uninformed science (especially to kids), I can not recommend this book as a worthwile purchase (unless you cut out the last page!)."
3,Decent net,"This is decent netting for keeping birds off your plants. The holes are a little larger than I would prefer (birds might still be able to pick at fruit close to the edge), and the netting itself is kind of thin. If a bird did fly into it odds are it would get caught so keep an eye out."
4,BIRD NET,SHIPPED SAFELY IN A TREMENDOUS BOX. NO NEED FOR SUCH A BIG BOX. IT WOULD HAVE COME SAFELY IN A LARGE BROWN ENVELOPE...
2,Not great,"Had high hopes for this as birds were picking at all my figs this summer.One thing I failed to notice or they failed to mention is that this is just one large sheet of netting. No strings to tie ends, or elastic, nothing. you are on your own to come up with a way to keep this thing on your tree. It's like good luck!did not end up using it at all.:("
3,Dalen 14 x 14 bird mesh,"Product arrived promptly and was immediately utilized. During the growing season it did a fine job of keeping local birds off of our grapes and hybrid blueberries. Removal of netting at end of season was difficult due to plant growth, but the Dalen nets came off nicely and we were able to roll them for storage and use for next year! A good quality product! Thanks!!"
3,Keeps birds out,"I draped this over some plants in pots with the edges on the ground anchored by rocks. It kept the birds away, but I finally took it down because three lizards and a horned toad got caught in the mesh and died. I could rearrange the setup I suppose, but the deaths of critters that eat bugs was too much for me."
3,Dalen BN2 14-Foot by 14-Foot Bird-X Net 3/4-Inch Mesh,"The size of the holes in this net is a bit too big to protect blueberries. Also, it's hard to tie together at the bottom, so I just left it hanging over the top. I think it would work for a bigger bush or small tree, not for a small blueberry bush that's only a few years old."
4,Amazon custom fit auto floormats,"Floormats sold by Amazon can be ordered with a choice of models and color. The rug is made of a thick nylon material with a rubber backing. The new rug may not match the color of the old rug, but is close."
2,"Nice Tips, but didn't stand through winter.","The exhaust tips were nice when I first bought them. They didn't hold up too well after a few months, especially in winter. Would rather buy cheaper ones next time. We'll see if they polish back up."
4,A Special Book,"I liked this book, and enjoyed the large print! A very good romance. . .If you liked this bookm you would thorougly enjoy Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher, It is for certain the love story of the century . ..Every love a woman or man can ever know is in the book, and it leaves a forever mark upon your heart . .."
2,just average,"I found this DVD to be not as good as I expected. It's just the filming of a California Spey Casting exibition. Their only casting into a swimming pool, which is perfect conditions. The disk shows one how to cast, but it's much harder when your out on the stream. A much better, and cheaper spey casting tourtial is the John and Amy Hazel's Intro to Spey Casting. This disk does a better job of showing you the spey cast and it also shows one where fish will be, and how to get the fly to the fish."
5,Art of Spey Casting,"John C. Till, Fly Fishing Federation Master Certified Casting Instructor--this is a must have DVD for any person interested in fly fishing.CASTING is the only skill that you cannot buy in the sport, you can hire a guide, buy files and equipment--but only the fisherperson can get the fly to the fish.There are 3 ways to cast a single handed rod--the Roll Cast, the Overhead Cast and the Spey Cast. This video is a great learning tool for all 3 ways to cast a fly line. I recommend it to all of my students. This is the only video that a student needs--the video is great for students of all levels--from the beginner to the most expert caster. The DVD is almost 3 hours of material--what a super bargain for only $34.95.The video contains step by step instruction by the best casters in the World and some of the best instructors in the World.The DVD is not only instructional, but enjoyable to view."
5,The art of spey casting,"This DVD has captured on film the best spey casting I've ever seen. The host, Lani Waller, is informative and is always a pleasure to listen to. For all flyfishermen, Chris King's demonstration is proof that single handed spey casting will become the fastest growing aspect of the sport. For instructors and advanced casters, the many different presentations from casters all over the world conveys new techniques and helps solidify the basic dynamics in the art of spey casting. For the beginner, Simon Gawesworth simplyfies the whole process with his easy to understand vocabulary and instruction. If you want to add a whole new arsenal to your flyfishing skills, this is a must see!"
3,The edges of disappointment,"I personally do believe that this album has some very beautiful and haunting songs, but in terms of The Tea Party's potential, this album was rather disappointing. Out of all The Tea Party albums, I believe that this was the worst album they have made. The only really good songs featured were the popular ones: ""The Grand Bazaar"", ""Fire in the Head"" and the stunningly beautiful ""Sister Awake"". I applaud The Tea Party for creating those three beautiful pieces, however it made the rest of the songs pale in comparison. Dilemna: when fans expect so much of their favorite band's music, it is hard to always produce the best. However, with The Tea Party, it hardly seems as a impossible task to create consistant first rate music, as seen in the albums of ""Splendor Solis"" and ""Triptych""."
5,wrong genre,"This is a great step in the refining of the Tea Party. However it is definately not at home in the industrial section. The Tea Party is heavily influenced by eastern music, much in the same style as Led Zepplin. They belong in the Rock section! Yet even for being incorrectly categorized, a superb alblum. Transmission, the next step in the history of an excellent band (Tea Party) is dependent largely on keyboards and electronics but still has an organic feel, not what I would believe belongs in an industrial/dance section. Too often people here an electronic sound and they instantly categorize a band as this genre. Sometimes they are right, but this time they are not doing one of the best current rock bands justice, and depriving people who would never go into the indus/dance section of some great music. I've seen them play live and they do a wonderful job and are not dependent on machines live like God Lives Under Water is."
3,Purely Excccccelent,"Yes I have this album and the others. All are masterpeices, all are different and express a different mood.I have to agree with many others that the guitar work and colabaration of various styles sounds just as good, if not, better in real life performance. Buy this album! Its a MUST."
3,Very good Canadian modern rock band,"Pretty good album from Our Canadian trio, this music is one of a kind.Very good tracks on this one like ""Correspondences"" and ""Sister awake""Tea Party's album are still good to listen to, which is not the same with many band of the 90's. Music is often like wine, good stuff get often better with age, this is what happen with The Tea Party."
2,MEDIOCRE,"The instrumentation/arrangements/recording/production were flawless but the magic is not there.There's too much of that one flavor throughout the album... It becomes tiring. Also chorus lines aren't strong enough... contrasted with their earlier album ""Splendor Solis""... this album is pretty weak."
4,Canada is the next musical hot spot.,"I got this album for the song ""fire in the head"" I listened to the rest of the tracks. Didn't like them, put the cd away, and didn't listen to it again untill only recently. I'm very sorry I did that because this is a very musicly rich album to own. ""The edges of twilight"" Has a song to fit every emotion you want to convay wile listening and it takes music from new and exsotic view points. You have everything here from Powerful rock songs, Softer more lyricly expressive songs and exsotic songs that use insterments like the 12 sting guitar and Sitar. The tea party is a highly talented band that doesn't get the attention they should for the calaber of music they make. I like to think of them as a close relative to Led Zepplin or the Page and Plant era rock. Do your self a favor and check them out."
3,These are okay,"These are okay. I expected a little more heavy duty. They work just fine. Unfortunately I have a cat that crawls drapes (whole other problem) and these bend. The cat really doesn't weight take much, however I realize that they are not meant to support a cats weight. I'm thinking I may need a chain mail drape! LOLGood value for the price."
1,Shut up and write the story,"To echo others, this book fails to deliver on its central promise to tell the story of a recovery mission for lost treasure. The author injects himself into the narrative, despite being hired as the team's ""chronicler,"" in effect destroying objectivity. Too often he rambles into the weeds to impress readers with his knowledge of other writers or historical occurrences. He also breaks into moralising which, even if I agree with some of it, I don't want to read in a book of this kind. Save your money; don't but this one."
1,Body Glove,"El pedido no me vino el que pedí, vino de otro color u otro modelo. Completamente distinto de lo que se pidió..."
1,small,"nice rashguard however, I have a large one in different brands which fit perfect, this one is way tiny, i would almost say its a large kids, since my sister wears a small adult and it looks almost the same size. Very disappointed."
4,NIce Quality - Bad Sizing,Loved the color and design but had to return as sizing was off at least one size. I know these are suppose to fit snug but my daughter could not move in it.
4,Great,"I love how it fits other than at the neck line. I believe it gave me a big head complex, other than that the quality is great and it feels like a ""GLOVE"" haha sorry for the pun."
4,Pretty but small,This rash guard is small like other reviewers have said. I especially found the neck to be tight and difficult to get over my head. I usually wear a size 2-4 and the small is on the tight side for me.
2,see through and runs small,this shirt is very see through- can see my moles- yukand runs small- got a Lg and it's still too tighti'm a size 6!
4,customer service,this company has excellent customer service and stand behind their product. quality mechandise. product is made well and fits as sizing suggests.
4,my head is full of ancient spanish or: mi cabeza esta lleno de español antigua,This is a good dual langauge book for spanish students BUT much of the language is of a former era (the book was probably written in the 1500's). I preferred En el tiempo de las Mariposas...more timely and beautifully written.
4,a rose by any other name...,"This ""best of"" album by the MMO is also available (track for track) as ""Summer Moods"". The latter may be easier to find. If you still have a turntable (remember them?) many MMO titles are available on the Bainbridge label (1/2 speedmastered yet!) for very little money. All the early Mystic Moods cds (their best work) are out of print now and usually fetch collectors prices w-h-e-n you can find them. Good luck!"
1,Did anyone else get a instrumental cd?,I bought this cd and ended up getting a cd with 4 instrumental songs on it.I think the studio goofed up on cover and cd label.Luckily I got my money back.
2,Another Ripper Theory,"This book, although quire interesting as a ""who was Jack"" theory, just did not ring true. The diary itself allegedly written by James Maybrick is the problem, it just does not seem plausible. The author spent an awful lot of time making things fit to the diary rather than the other way around and it just did not convince me. Also taking into account that the owner of the diary was an aspiring and unsucessful writer and that he did not explain satisfactorily how he came to find it, I find this theory a bit hard to swallow. Entertaining though if you are interested in Jack the Ripper."
4,one of the sickest books ive ever read,"this book goes on and on about how this diary by jack the ripper is for real and not a fake.that parts ok ftom a real life history point of view,but what really makes the book is the part at the end where ,for sanitys sake,the write out the diary in its original form.all the gut-wrenching late night antics of a arsenic addicted whore slasher are brought brutaly to life.unless youre the kind of desensitized gore loving maniac that gets into this stuff,id steer clear.this makes csi:LAS VEGAS look like mary freakin poppins.very gory."
4,"Critical thinking, anyone?","The uncritical acceptance of folks like Mr. Merkl aside, James Maybrick makes an unlikely candidate for the Whitechapel fiend. In order for him to have indeed been the Ripper, he would have to display a pathology, methodology and pattern of behavior that is completely unique in the annals of serial murder, and that seems exceedingly unlikely. As to the diary itself, it does indeed stand on it's own, riddled as it is with mistakes and inconsistancies that the real killer would never make. I also find it telling that it is written in an easy-to-turn-into-a-screenplay format (how considerate of the ripper!). All that aside, I STILL reccommend this book as an exercise in critical thinking, an entertaining read, and an example of exactly what kind of crazy theories and hoaxes this case inspires (See also ""Jack the Ripper, the Final Solution"" by Knight)."
3,Interesting hoax?,"Ripperologists almost universally condemn this book as a hoax, but if you know a few reliable facts about the Ripper (as outlined, for instance in Sugden's book), reading this one is a good exercise in critical thinking, at any rate.Even if Maybrick had kept a diary and this was it, one would still only be left with the ""fact"" that, added to Maybrick's many other delusions and daydreams was the delusion (which eventually overturned his reason) that he was Jack the Ripper.The list of mentally ill people who have claimed to be the Ripper is as long as the list of innocent people fingered by 20th Century Ripperologists as having been the Ripper!"
3,Amusing 20th century hoax.,"Someone in England read a book about criminal profiling and forged a diary using those results. Sorry, but no crime fits a catagory THAT perfectly. Funny, but not nearly as hilarious as theories that Saucy Jack was the Prince of Wales."
2,baloney,"Blimey! Some people aren't half gullible, arern't they? See below for some scorching examples. If you lot can read 'FM' on the wall of the Kelly murder scene then you can probably see the face of Julie Andrews on Mars. Er.. haven't you noticed that the unfortuate Mr Maybrick's actual handwriting doesn't look like the stuff in the diary? And that Mrs M said nothing about her hubby's ripping activities at her trial for his murder, despite the fact she's supposed to have known about it according to this 'diary'. Don't you think her chances of acquital would have leapt up the charts if she could have made such a claim?"
2,Not too much fun,"I bought this thinking it would be lots of fun. I have a keyboard and some other instruments, but I found this kind of boring. But I suppose if a person couldn't play other instruments this might be ok. It is a nice instrument, very well made. It doesn't have to be tuned so that is good. I have an omni chord and it is about like that except it can play on its own. I work alot so maybe if I could put more time into it I would like it better. I own it and spent the money, so I am going to use it and try to enjoy it more."
1,Oh Dominic the Donkey would be so sad,"Seriously, an Elephant, something as clumsy and ""dumb"" as an elephant---Democrats would never pick that as their mascot!"
2,A step off the path,"Anthony Price wrote a highly literate, historically informed, well plotted series of espionage novels focused on an imaginery branch of the British Security Service. However, this is the weakest of the lot. Straying away from the British protagonists he wrote about so sympathetically and honestly in the other books of the series, two American CIA operatives are the center of the plot. They are not portrayed unfairly or in a mean way - there is just not the tone of inner truth about them that resounds so much in his other characters. Somehow the plot seem half hearted as well. If you must skip one of this long series of short novels on the themes of the entanglement of past, present, and future and the meaning of loyalty, this would be the one. If this is your first look for a Price novel do go read the others - they are fine pieces of work."
2,"CD spoiled by jazzy version of ""September In The Rain.""","I bought this CD and gave it a TWO Star review because of Dakota Staton's version of ""September In The Rain."" Under these circumstances you ethically CANNOT rate this as a five star album. The best it can rate is four-plus something, Do the right thing and rate it in a mathematically correct manner."
4,Picture lies,"The picture makes it look much nicer than it actually is. But for $30-40 its hard to complain. Spouse likes it, but I would not buy it again if I saw it first."
4,It's engravable!,I bought this locket and got it engraved with my sons name on it(Caden) It looked great. You could fit 5 or 6 letters on it. It was a good locket.
5,Excelente producto!!,"Es increible la calidad de sus productos, los felicito, cuenten conmigo como un cliente fiel.Att.Hector MejiaHonduras"
1,Do Not Buy: Product Code Error!,"Ordered this knowing it was inexpensive but what I received was worse than expected in part because Amazon sent the wrong item. Spoke with Customer Service who sent a replacement which they promised would be inspected first; however, the same WRONG item was again sent. The problem is the item has been switched with another silver heart locket, one even cheesier than the product listed. I contacted Customer Service regarding the replacement; they recognize now the real problem and are working to correct ... eventually. Both lockets have been returned; there didn't seem to be any way of getting the proper locket. I wound-up ordering a completely different design from another vendor."
3,Rbaz,"Love this product, Would love it more But the hinges are cracking and the warenty is only good for a 1 year and i have had mine little over 2 years.The manufacture said thay will not cover it.Otherwise it does a great job,Loved it till now."
2,The book fell apart in my hands.,It looked great when I opened the box but it didn't hold up under my research. Sorry but I don't need a research item that will not hold up. This was listed as in good condition. The price was fair for this type of research item but don't anyone order one for a souvenier.I hate these reviews that are negative.But I have to tell the truth here. it would have fallen apart had I given this item as a gift.
5,MOST FAVORITE BOOK EVER!,"Probably one of the best historical novels about Charleston that captures the Pinkney's, the Tradd's, and the Anson's while keeping with the historical accuracy of the times.If you're a fan of North and South by Jakes - you'll LOVE this book!"
2,I expected to love this...,"I really enjoyed two other books (Scarlett/Fields of Gold) by this author and expected to love this one.For some reason, I found this book really tedious... I should mention that I expect and am usually charmed by some level of tedium found in books of the old South (and old England for that matter). So, I'm not sure why I had very little patience for this book.I was stuck on a plane otherwise I may not have finished it. In some sections, I would only read the first sentence of each paragraph. I have to admit that the last third of the book became much more interesting. I understand that the beginning of the book lays the foundation for the rest of the book but the lack of enjoyment of the first 2/3 was just too much...Oh well. I'm hesitant to read another Ripley book but liked the first two enough to give it another shot. Hopefully I have better luck next time around."
4,Awesome...,"Had the privlidge of seeing her in Santa Rosa last Wednesday, at an upscale eatery. A local radio station was inviting winners of a contest (and their guest), for a free lunch and an intimate concert by Dana Glover. The whole room sat spellbound as she sang four songs from her Testimony CD (which wasn't released until the following day), captivated by her voice, lyrics, and keyboard. We will all be hearing more from this incredible young woman from NC. I'm looking forward to hearing more of her on the air, and hopefully on VH1! I seldom rate anything with the highest rating, simply because I believe there's always room for improvement; but in this case it was merely out of habit. Good luck, Dana, as I believe you're well on your way to a very successful career. Vicki in Santa Rosa"
5,Magic,"I listen to alot of music everyday. This one song played (Thinking Over) and I had to know who this person was. This lady sings from her heart and with every word you feel her soul. If you want an album that screems buy me through every song buy this one immediately. Go down and insert it into your car stereo, close the windows turn the volume up nicely, and just close you eyes and listen to the feeling this girl imparts to every note. This is an album every person who loves music should own. This lady deserves all the credit and promotion she can get."
5,COULDN'T BE BETTER,"ok here it is folks-A STAR HAS BEEN BORN! This talented woman gives you a taste of soul/rock/r&b/pop/gospel....you name it! I, like someone else who wrote a review here, heard a piece of ""thinkin over"" for the commercial for tuck everlasting AND I WAS HOOKED. This CD is easily one of my faves (and trust me that's saying a lot). She plays piano-sings like a godess and looks like one too. Purchasing this cd is so worth it guys-IT WON'T END UP A COASTER LIKE SOME OF THE OTHERS! Hope you enjoy it as much as I have."
5,Testimony,"I think she is such a powerful talent, I don't know why she hasn't had her own special on TV. I really enjoy the cd and find the songs interesting. She has a very provocative quality to her voice. Sometimes she reminds me of Taylor Dayne I look forward to more of her work and possibly seeing her in a concert."
4,"On the ""Two Weeks Notice"" soundtrack","Just watched ""Two Weeks Notice"". The ending song during the credits immediately caught my attention (The Way). I looked and found Dana's name in the credits. I will buy this CD anticipating more of the same, when received. The bluesy quality of her vocals are great.By the way, don't buy the ""Two Weeks Notice"" score if you are looking for Dana Glover. The soundtrack, if they would have used the song list on the movie, would have been excellent. The score is the orchestrated sound actually used as backgrounds in the movie. Too Bad."
5,Absolutely FANTASTIC!!!,"I bought this album on a whim - I never heard of this artist before (she hasn't reached us here in Ireland!) but I liked the sample music I was hearing on Amazon.com. When I got her album, it blew my mind! It is fantastic. I LOVE it and can't stop listening to it!! Dana Glover's music is fantastic, each song is a gem and worth listenting to. For a debut album it is a very strong piece of work. Her music style is a good mix of gospel and jazz.She is a woman of many talents - singer, musician, writer... None of her songs disappoint. She has a very strong, wonderful voice and is a talented musician. I eagerly await her second album and hope it comes out soon!"
1,Threw it to a garbage,"I bought this tape few years ago and finally I watched it yesterday and ... threw it to a garbage. About 40% of the film was devoted to the Jewish cause with a lot of misleading information. For example, the film accuses Poles (not Germans) for the holocaust. It forgets the fact that the number of Poles who died during the WWII was equal to the number of Jews, and many of them died for helping Jews. If you want to see a film about the Pope look somewhere else."
3,Stop with the Spoiled Kids Aready,"This character will never replace Greg Monarch, the author's previous hero, because of his family baggage. Old Greg carried a lot of baggage too, but it didn't seem to get in the way so much. Why is it that author's think smart mouthed kids who need to be disciplined rather than coddled and excused, are a desirable plot fixture? Instead of making this ""hero"" more likable, it made him appear weak and not too bright. It was fun to try to identify the California central coast community of the setting, but people who know this area will find it pretty unconvincing. However, considering there is so little out there to read except for serial killers (the more horrifying the better) and unbelievable female protaginists filled with angst (actually a problem with a lot of male characters as well) this is worth the time especially if you can get it a used book store."
2,Poorly articulated nonsense,"The book, while appearing to be quite academic, is, in fact a diatribe.Some of the foregoing reviews have been pinned mainly on the emotion of the debate regarding foreign assistance, and not on the facts of the achievement thereof.I'd like to put forth the case that, whatever may have been the operating environment during Mr. Hancock's experience, things have changed. They have changed with regard to the type of people that are working in the international development community, and the type of people who work for international NGOs. Whatever Viola P. Renya might think, my experience has shown that these are not people who believe they have 'dyed and gone to haven' (SIC), because they 'scored' a job with CARE or Save the Children. They are people who have left much more lucrative employment, in some cases, to help their fellow-people."
4,"Ahhh, refreshing and amusing","Hit the nail on the head as we would say back in the Netherlands. A very good read, at time one wonders how it all can be true. Hope Graham keeps up the good work and updates his book."
4,Beastly,"One of the better low-budget werewolf flicks, that I've seen, and I'm a lycanthropy completist. Beats other low-budget films of this type (like WolvesBayne, Big Bad Wolf, Never Cry Werewolf, etc.) because it gives us plenty of doses of blood/gore, as well as decent B-movie acting. Throw in an original werewolf design, some hot local color, and you've got all the ingredients for some schlocky fun."
3,CRY WOLF,"BEAST OF BRAY ROAD is your average B-movie --- adequate if unmemorable performances, etc.Based on true events that occurred in Wisconsin, the story follows werewolf attacks in a small community. Jeff Denton stars as a Chicago cop transported to this community who works with a cryptozoologist (Thomas Downey) to track the beast down.It all moves at a respectable pace and the werewolf's identity surprised me. The werewolf effects are pretty lame, however.There have been many better werewolf flicks but many worse!"
3,Okay B movie,"Plot was okay, the acting was sporadic, but there were some very intense special effects."
3,The Process Of Weeding Out,"Why did I give this only three stars? Not enough tracks. 'Screw' is my favorite on this one. 'Southern' and 'Your Last' are ok. The first recording of the title track, which was on Live '84, sounds much heavier, and believe it or not, more polished. If you like Ginn's instrumentals, get Family Man first, and some of the early Gone material if you can find it. Those two and this one are his best."
3,Experimental instrumental album from Punk Greats,"I enjoy this record because the songs seem to flow into one another in a decent fashion. Kira and Bill are not spectacular, nor are they very creative on these songs. However, they provide a solid backing for Greg Ginn to churn out these sludge riffs of prolonged ferocity. I think the songs lack any real highs, but are interesting to listen to. All Black Flag albums are pretty good, even without that classic intensity. I prefer MinuteFlag a little bit more over this, but it is a good buy for the price."

1,Used Shoes????,"When I purchased these shoes I believed that they were a new item on sale, not a used shoe at a discount price. I am extremely disappointed in the lack of notice that was given during the purchase process."
4,Love and Death,"M. K. Wren takes the classic Romeo & Juliet story and sets it rural Oregon in OH, BURY ME NOT.Private investigator Conan Flagg is asked by an old friend G.W.

4,Very Helpfull but not for beginners,"I always not sure how to play CCLI songs, this DVD shows the normal speed and position of the chords. A very helpfull tools to learn CCLI worship songs, it has CD song track, and Piano track with vocal sing along."
2,this is hard,"So I've been tinkering with this for a few hours now, and I have to say I was disappointed by how much of the cool functionality appears to be dependent on the user's knowledge of AppleScript. I'm a fairly technical person, but I don't have a lot of confidence when it comes to tweaking or merging applescripts. This is way over my head, and I've been using a Mac since 1984."
1,"Defective, poor customer service - AVOID",This product is useless. There are problems with the software that prevent it from working with a MacPro and possibly other machines. The product answers calls for a few hours or days and then locks up and stops working. At times it even grabs your phone line and keeps it busy for hours. The company maintains no staff of technical support people to help. It took me three weeks to get an acknowledgment of the problem from the company and then for 3 more weeks no one has gotten back to me after repeated attempts. I still have not gotten a refund and the product is completely useless. AVOID!
2,"Interesting, but Not for the average user!","All this product really does straight out of the box is answer calls, take messages and emails them somewhere. everything else is done by using scripts and you putting together files and folders in a very specific way to the program to understand what you want it to do. now, if you are a apple script programmer this gizmo might be very powerful as you can make it to almost anything, but if you just expect it to come with a nice interface to do this, look elsewhere (phonevalet). i tried the included voice mailbox setup program several times and could not get it to jump to the appropriae mailbox, nor would it recognize the pin code and jump to the main menu. this is such basic functionality that the fact i could not get this to work in half a day (and i am a it guy) made me return it."
2,No Ride,I was very dissatisfied with the packaging (a metal container with three CDs arranged one on top of another) and mostly bad LIVE versions of hit songs. Don't bother.
4,how to change the speaker cable?,Somebody mentioned that the speaker wires need to be changed. Where can buy the clip terminals for the speaker wire? Can I re-use the clip terminals come with the system?
3,Not bad,"I bought this system because of the price. For the price, it works fine. The controls/displays/setup/remote could be WAY easier to use, which is my only real complaint. I suppose that ""ease of use"" is something you have to pay extra for. For the money, though, the quality is pretty good, and it sounds great (in my non-techno-geek opinion)."
3,It's OK at best,"I was needing a new surround sound system with HDMI passthrough. I found this Sony; and since my TV is Sony, I assumed it would work together nicely. They do. However...The speaker setup is ""weird"" - jazz, concert hall, etc. What??The subwoofer is too boomy. I have since replaced it with custom built sub which shakes my living room, but I can still hear people talking. The surround-ness of this system is less noticeable than previous system. Overall, if not for the HDMI, my previous sub $100 RCA system sounded better and was a much better value."
5,It helps me understand and influence people everyday,This book is an easy read and has step by step techniques that are easy to use. It focuses on understanding distinctions of why people say something and then tries to help put it in a catagory that you can handle with a leadership decision to motivate and coach. Many times I was able glean powerful tools off just one page. I am just finishing my first year as a successful sales manager. Thank you Kim
5,"excellent, engauging and very useful","First of all, the book makes you aware of the ""distinctions"" and it is a powerful tool in managing communication. The next is the concept of shifting your emphasis from the ""past"" to ""future"" and then to ""present"", to enable effective actions and change in behaviour. This is a practiceable, effective tool that managers or team leaders can use and establish good control on conversational situations. The mere awareness of different possibilities itself can enhance one's competitiveness."
5,"The Data Warehouse ETL Toolkit: Practical Techniques for Extracting, Cleaning",The book was mailed well within time mentioned by seller and is a new book.
3,Listening to Turkish,"I didn't have time to use this tool very much before our trip. I listened to the tape as I was doing other things but never got the chance to actually use both the book and tape to its best advantage. However, I made a Turkish friend in Istanbul and may get an opportunity to go back some day. I hope to use this book to be able to talk with my friend in her native language half as well as she spoke English."
5,Voice like an Angel!,I was hanging out in the Pasadena Borders one Saturday night...And I hear a voice drawing me upstairs...singing...Wow! She sings like an angel from heaven! The passion she feels for her words and music is awesome and heartfelt!
5,More than just simple magic,"""Make This Minute Last"" and ""Underneath Your Sky"" are wonderfully romantic, ""Guardian Angel"" and ""Ghost Wandering this Earth"" are so incredibly full of longing, and ""If I Could Read Your Mind"" will make you laugh. All songs are more than just Simple Magic."
5,Best artist ever? I think so!,"I'm absolutely in love with Marina's music, I listen to it as much as I can and as often as I can. Simple Magic is another great album and I can't wait for more. The songs are touching and make you feel emotions most other music today doesn't give you."
3,"""Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees. Place death in center rack 14-16 minutes.""","Michael picked a bad time to be late for work in the neurosurgery department. His punishment? Suspension? Verbal warning? Heck, no, try becoming a test subject for Dr. Howell's out of control experimentation on ""curing"" death! After the results makes Michael go on a mini killing spree and being placed in a psyche ward, the mad doctor moves and sets up shop on a remote island. Seven years later, Michael (now with bleach blonde hair) is released from the cuckoo's nest and plans a ""vacation"" with a group of friends on a certain island retreat where certain experiments are still being conducted. Purely coincidental... not. This low budgeter from further down under (New Zealand) has ample bloody FX to appease the gorehounds and enough oddball characters to keep attention spans riveted, only to be unsatisfied in the end once it's realized there was nobody in the film to really care about that much in the first place. 5.25/10"
3,Michael Hurst is the only good thing about this movie,"A typical, low-budget horror film whose plot leaves alot to be desired. Michael Hurst is definately the only thing that makes this movie worth watching. He does a good job and certainly is easy on the eyes."
3,"Nurse, Pass Me The Brain-Drill...","A guy (Michael Hurst) is given an experimental drug that causes him to kill his parents w/ a shotgun. He is then committed to a mental institution for seven years. Upon his release, our hero takes a trip w/ his girlfriend and another couple to a remote island. The same island where he'd received the drug! You see, he's out for revenge against the doctor who destroyed his life, and nothing's gonna stop him! However, there's more going on than he realizes, including twisted brain surgeries that have helped the evil doctor create an army of crazed zombies! This one's rather grim, w/ a few humorous moments in between the exploding heads and impalements. There's even a bit of nudiness near the beginning! Not too awful, just don't expect a masterpiece..."
3,Good.,"I bought this song, only because I loved the track number 4. Honestly I didn't like the whole album. Although I LOVE Thievery Corporation and midtempo groups as well. Posterior albums are great."
2,It's a disappointment,"The whole track has a very slow moving, heavily drugged out feeling, definitely NOT their best mix."
2,"If you can get it for five dollars, maybe buy it...","but don't pay fifteen. It is nice to see a psychedelic, hard rock classic oldies extravaganza like this, but these videos are questionable at best. There is far better footage of Hendrix, Joplin, the Who, Airplane (with a female lead vocalist--that's a good thing, because she sounds good), and the Doors to be found elsewhere. I was letdown with the Beatles interview, as I thought they were going to explain what they thought about the new direction this music was taking. Oh well."
3,good quality,nice quality but they do make a funny noise because of the turned in lip. I did not care for that nso I cut the end off at an angle & that cured to problem.
5,The book you need,"If you plan on going canoeing in N. Sask. this is the book you need. Almost every major river in this area is profiled with history, character of river, detailed map with UTM coordinates of important sites. Also includes info. on the type of fish in each river - important for the anglers. I have used it on several occasions when paddling in this beautiful area of N. Sask. The appendix includes important outfitter contacts and websites to check water levels."
4,Great series,If you've seen the previous volumes then you know about Kaede being gone and Kusinagi's failure to save her. Well in this one you find out what really happened to Kaede and the series begins a new twist as see the true enemy of Human race brought forth. Not to mention Kusinagi's new battle with himself as to how to deal with these new events and how he feels about certain things.
5,LP has different track list,"memo to Amazon: the LP version has different tracks from the CD, including LP-only cover of Steppenwolf's ""Hey Lawdy Mama."" The LP and CD versions should have accurate track lists -- there's quite a few songs that don't overlap."
5,One of the Best (and Saddest) Live Records Ever.,"Released after the death of the great D. Boon, this showcases the Minutemen at their best (even if the fidelity isn't always perfect). Listening to D. and Mike Watt howling out their econo political songs before a live audience was as good as music got in the 80s. Hearing D. Boon singing ""No No No to Draft and War"" always makes me fill up, knowing we can't hear him today."
5,D Boon changed my life,"I'm not really into this type of music but when I first heard the Minutemen I was won over. The music was relevant in the reactionary 80's but I swear that ""Little man with a gun in his hand"" is about George W. I love this band."
3,Doesn't stay put,"I am not impressed. The colors are light when applied, and it gets greasy and sticks in the creases of your eyelid."
4,Affordable but works!,"Affordable, actually works, and hasn't fallen apart like some. Nice to get both kinds of chargers!"
2,Does not work with A707 as listed,"The price is awesome for these products but unfortunately, they do not work with my A707 Red/ATT. In the listing it indicates that it is one of the acceptable models but none of the products work well. The connection fits into the phone but when the charger is connected to the power, the phone goes into a continuing bootup cycle. It boots up then turns itself off and boots up again. The packaging indicates the products are made for Samsung D807."
4,Great but no shipping info prior to purchase,"Product was great, fast shipping but no type of shipping carrier info was availalble prior to purchase. This was a big issue for me due to living in a rural area and different shipping carriers only go to certain areas."
3,You get what you pay for,"The car jack lasted about 5 months then broke. While it worked, it did a fine job charging my phone. Just don't expect it to last a long time. Since I only spent about $3 on this, I guess I got my money's worth but now I am looking for another and won't buy this one again. I did not use the home charger as my OEM is still working fine. The computer cable works as expected."
5,Great product!,I bought this as an extra-to-have-in-the-house charger set. It is great. I have needed it for different reasons when other people need a charger. The price was also great!
2,Bargaincell- 3-Piece Value Combo Pack Of Samsung,THESE ACCESSORIES WAS PURCHASED FOR MY SAMSUNG BEHOLD BUT IT WAS NOT MADE FOR THE BEHOLD.I PROBABLY GOT THE WRONG PRODUCT BUT I KEPT IT BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR ANOTHER PHONE SOMEDAY.I HAD TO PURCHASE THE RIGHT CHARGER LOCALLY. HOWEVER IT ARRIVED ON TIME AND THE PRODUCT WAS NEW.
2,Good deal Bad charger,I bought this item thinking it was a good deal. I mean how can you pass this up especially when best buy charges 20 bucks for a charger. And then it turned bad. The house charger doesnt have a stable connection with my phone. The usb doesnt even work and the car charger fell a part at the base. Maybe I just received a faulty item. Or maybe it was just cheaply made. The good thing is.... I didnt loose much
1,Safety Issue,"Let me first say that I am an industrial maintenance supervisor that worked my way to this position. I've been around a lot of tools for a long time. When I received this clamp I was impressed with the quality and it seemed like the perfect size for small clamping jobs. I thought I would get a lot of use out of it.That was before I pinched the palm of my hand so severely that I have quit using this tool. The first time I regarded it as carelessness on my part. However, even being careful, if you are not constantly watching the position of your clamping hand you can easily get pinched by the grip. The second time resulted in swelling and a blood blister and the third just cut me. Keep in mind that I didn't do this all at once but I kept going back to this tool because I thought it was such a handy size. I have stopped using this clamp and it is in my ""yard sale"" pile. Maybe the bigger ones are better?"
1,very disappointed,these clamp's stink I'm a carpenter and use clamps all the time these clamps do not have enough pressure to hold metal stud's on the vertical big waste of money I spend more time picking them up off the floor than doing work and yes I did try to adjust them don't throw your money away.
5,Best clamps I've ever owned!!,"These clamps work absolutely great! All the other clamps I own are now collecting dust. The clamps are easy to use, and hold everything you need without adjustment. I highly recommend these clamp to any person that works with their hands and could use a third, or even fourth hand."
2,Needs rubber grips,"Have 2 sets of these, agree with the negative review about the pinching problem, if the handles came with rubber or plastic grips the problem would be solved."
5,The best,You do not need pills or chiropractor . Just spend up to 2 min with it on floor and you will feel the blood flow and less pain and tightness in your neck. Works like self mobilization treatment. You have to know where to place it. It may be painfull if you have a lot of inflamationn in sub occipital area but it will help to reduce it.
2,small occipital base pivot piece part #1950,"I am a physical therapist who is trained in Cranial Sacral therapy. I do not feel this pivotal product does the trick for self treatment for myself or my patients, unless you wedge it under your neck on it's bottom edge (not flat) while lying on a pillow or bed that can help stabilize it. Perhaps it would work better on a pediatric patient?? The neck slant piece it too short. I was under the assumption I was ordering the larger model that seems to fit adults better - I have used that one before and it is much more comfortable to use for self treatment. I am contacting this company for a replacement."
5,where has this been all my life!!!!,"I have been suffering from occipital migraines for many years, this is wonderful at releasing the headache!!! Was suggested by my therapist, who also uses one."
2,Not for the sensitive,This is just not for me. DO NOT make the mistake of staying on this too long or falling asleep on it. It will make your entire head and neck go numb and you won't be able to move for awhile. I don't recommend.
3,Not much luck for me,"I was excited about this product, but it didn't do much for me. Maybe you need to buy the whole system? I use instead a rolled up towel under my neck."
2,Ehhh,"The cord lengths are not equidistant. The cord for the right ear is ridiculously long, leaving this weird dangling cord whenever i wear it, making me feel stupid. The sound quality isn't bad, but there is little to no bass and I can't see the difference between a normal [...] pair of earphones. It was sub-par compared to my last pair of earphones that I bought at [...]. The cord also gets tangled easily."
2,Tinny Not Vibrant,"I seldom write a review, but with nearly 1000 folks saying mostly positive things about these buds, I figured it was worth a few minutes to share my dislike. It is simple. They are simply noisy at the high end. I have come to learn that most people cannot hear noise as well as me, but if you are one of them, move on to a better product. I love the balance and respectable bass of my 13.5mm drivensony MDR-EX85LP/Red Ex Monitor Stereo Headphonesthough it amazes me that Sony makes them, I never much liked Sony."
4,Love 'em,"I have been using my Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds for a about a month now and they are perfect for me. Good sound quality and comfortable. The nice part is that they are small. The bad part is they are small. Nice because you hardly notice you are wearing them. Bad because it makes them a little difficult to place in your ear. But once they are securely in place, wow, the sound is very good. I use them on my bus ride in to work everyday and they do a great job of keeping out the sound of the bus and let me enjoy my podcast or music. But you have to make sure they are really in tight and secure to get the full sound spectrum. If they are a little loose the bass tones really drop out. But overall, definitely a great value."
4,"Would LOVE, but WTHeck is with the shortened length?","I am no sound or music geek, but I noticed a marked improvement in the sound of my current playlist (through an iPod) with these earphones. The two-year warranty will come in handy as my cord length is wonky - the left ear cord is centimeters shorter than the right. If there is a quick fix, I'd love to know!"
4,Great headphones for the price,"I am not a speaker nerd, but I like these headphones. As good as others I bought for double the price. No complaints except for the nearly-impossible-to-get-into packaging."
4,Sennheiser CX300,"The major problem with these head phones is the cord length. They are not long enough for my mp3 player to be in my pocket and for the buds to go into my ears. Another problem is that the right and left cord lengths are asymmetrical which is awkward. With that being said, the good things include: great sound quality and durability. These headphones greatly reduce outside noise. I was walking with people and couldn't hear them with only the volume half up."
4,"Quality 'Phones, Bit Pricey","Sennheiser delivers quality in these little earbuds. The noise isolation is great for busy offices and coffee shops, the sound quality is crisp and clear. The cord is a bit short, especially considering the asymmetrical design (a little strange at first, but I'm getting used to it). Could be a little cheaper, but you have to pay for quality. Excellent for music lovers, those who want to drown out the outside world and those who want to look hip while doing it!"
3,Too much bass for me,"I prefer the Sony MDR-EX51LP earbuds. They are much more balanced. If you like thick , dense bass, go for the senhiesers. Otherwise, I recommend the Sonys - and they are cheaper,"
4,Excellent for the price paid!,"I bought these a month ago on a whim...I have a bunch of headsets, and I keep looking for the most comfortable set that sound good. So far, these seem to be the best. I also own a set of Shure E-2c's, which are much more expensive...and they sound good, but aren't as comfortable and don't deliver the bass that these do. I'm impressed to say the least. Right now these are the earbuds that I'm traveling with to enjoy solid sounds and keep the noise down on the BART in San Francisco. Anyone who has spent any time on there knows how loud it can be. All in all, I'd recommend these as a reasonble upgrade over any of the standard MP3/iPod headphones that come with a base unit. I'm done spending over $100 on headphones if these hold up like I think that they will!"
3,Adequate,"For the money these are sufficient. Certainly better than $20 Skull Candy, not nearly as good as $150 Shure. Cheap enough to loss/break and not ruin my day, good enough to enjoy at the gym... List price of $89.95 is way out of line, but for $20 a great deal."
4,Good Sound out of a small package,"The only reason i didnt rate these a 5 is the cord for the buds is kind of flimsy, i like a little bit stouter cables, but they sound great and that is what matters most to me. Also, they come with different size buds for different size ears which is always nice."
4,my second set,Loved these so much that I bought a second pair when the first got caught in a dispute between my pocket and a doorknob.
4,Beter than the price indicates.,"Certainly not in the class of the super-high fidelity ear phones, but far better than than what you might expect from the price. I use them to compensate for a hearing loss problem. I can plug them into the earphone jsck on my computer and hear as well as if my hearing were normal. Great product."
3,"Great sound, awkward cable","The headphones sound great and really block out a lot of outside noise. On the other hand, the cable is really awkward. It's not like an iPod one with both sides having the same length, instead the left side is really short while the right one is really long. So to avoid having a bunch of cable dangling in front of your face, you need to wrap the cable around the back of your neck. Also, the cable is made out of a thick kind of plastic that ""remembers"" its shape, so if you leave it rolled around something for a while, it isn't straight when you unroll it."
4,Excellent gift,I bought this as a gift and the person loved them! Excellent sound quality and blocks out noise around as well.
2,"Great sound, but....","I bought the Sennheiser CX300-B earbuds and had them for about a week. I was very happy with them for about two days. Although I do not pretend to be an audiophile, the sound was great. These earbuds are about 300x better than the ones that come with the ipod. They could produce sound at a high volume and they played the whole range of the audible spectrum. They are not the best headphones, but you're not paying $200 for them either.THE BAD: These earbuds have 3 sets of removable silicone earcups and one started to tear within two days. The earcups weren't very comfortable either. I constantly found myself readjusting them at work. In addition, they block so much sound that I couldn't hear others in my office at work. The worst part was the ""THUMP"" every time my feet hit the ground when I walked. The noise was extremely annoying. I sent these back and got the PX100s and loved them."
2,Bad Sound,The CX 300 earbuds are very tinny. Almost no bass compared to original earbuds that came with my NWZ-S616F Sony Walkman. The earbuds are more comfortable than the Sony earbuds. But the sacrifice of sound quality is to great to keep them. I am sending mine back.
5,Sennheiser has yet to disappoint!,"Like the majority of the reviews here, I am in favor of these earphones. Amazon's price is a bargain, even for the older models. The company makes quality earphones, and it is definitely doing it's job. Noise-cancellation works, the cord is perfect length, everything is quite durable, and comfortable as well. I am an everyman and I will keep this review short - the earbuds work great and it's recommended to those who want to try sennheisers before getting the newer brands, but I am saying not many will be disappointed for everyday use that is well above average."
1,Nice for the price or least until the cord started to fail,"Positives1. They stay in your ears.2. Decent sound3. When inside and not moving, they block a fair amount of noise.Negatives1. Asymetrical cord is a little short, I am 5'10"" and the cord pulls when it's in my pants pocket.2. Walking the cord movement noise is amplified, as someone else stated like a stethoscope.3. Wind noise seems to be amplified when outside.4. after 6 months of very light uses the cord is shorting out the sound on one side.Lack of durability is unacceptable."
2,Not suitable for air travel Poor noise cancellation capabilities,"These ear buds are an inexpensive compromise at getting better quality sound from Ear buttons. The Bass is not very strong. Sound quality is acceptable. However, the lack of a carrying container or pouch, plus the fact that they are poor at eliminating external noise, such as airplane engine noise, makes them a poor choice for air travel."
1,Unacceptable sound and comfort,Two things made this purchase a poor one:1. The sound is much too bright for me--it is fatiguing and uncomfortable.2. I get tiny shocks to my ears when connected to my laptop or Blackberry. The standard earbuds with the BB were far superior to these.
3,Good on everything but exercise.,"High marks on sound, looks, comfort.Low marks on usability for exercising or anything moving, really. When the cord rubs against anything, i.e., your shirt, it creates a deep sound to the earphone, interrupting the music that you're listening to. If you only intend to use this for when you're sitting down, lying down, or really just not moving, then it's fine. If you intend to use it while you're moving around, look elsewhere."
3,Possibly Fake but sound pretty good,"I was happy with my headphones and recently decided to call Sennheiser to see if they could check their authenticity. I left a message and a rep just called me back. He asked where I got them from, I told them a seller on Amazon, fulfilled by amazon. He told me they haven't produced CX 300's in 2 years (please note they still produce the CX 300 II) and that even if Amazon fulfilled the order they were most likely fake. I told him that they sounded good and everything looked real but he insisted that given the circumstances (price, seller, discontinued product) that they were almost definitely fake. I am going to return them and will be looking for other headphones. While I do think they sound pretty good for $17 I just can't justify keeping fake ones."
2,"better than the earbuds that come with most devices, but...",I found it next to impossible to get a good seal in the ear for me - which results in not so great sound.
3,Great earphones for the (discounted) price!,"I got these b/c I'm sick of the crappy white ipod earphones... for less than $40 with shipping I can't really complain. Yeah, the noisy and uneven cord is odd but it's not a show stopper. If I would have paid more for these I would probably be disappointed for all the reasons other people have stated... But these are definitely a step up from what I had. The sound is great, they fit well and I got them at a great price -- I'm happy.IF my cat happens to get a hold of them (b/c they don't come with a case)I won't totally be heartbroken.UPDATE - 12/3/07 - I'm returning these earphones. They SUCK! In my opinion anyway. I just ordered the Shure E3c!"
3,Good sound but a few flaws,"These headphones literally plug into your ear. They sound great and block a lot of external noise, but every time you bump the wire it makes a loud hollow bump in the earpiece. Not good for exercising. Also you can hear yourself breathe loudly through your nose. So my coworkers see me being very still and breathing through my mouth.The asymmetrical cord length works but means you have to reverse L-R to get the short side on the right if that's what you need (the way my desk is, i require my MP3 player at my right elbow, also my laptop headphone plug is on that side. Not too big of a deal unless you are relying on stereo positioning. I like these, but I considered returning them - I destroyed the plastic packaging through trying to open it so I decided to just keep them and use them at work."
3,Could use improvments.,"These earphones are a great price and have a great mid - high range however, the low or (bass) is really poor. You have to really turn up the volume and EQ (power) to get some bass.The ear piece is designed too short and they don't want to stay in your ears very well.If Sennheiser could change these things and keep the price the same around $35.00 and market them by challenging people to compare they with their more expensive competitors they would sell a lot of them!I should also mention that they came almost overnight with regular shipping!"
1,Worthless if they don't fit your ear,"They never mention it in the product description, but these are completely worthless if you have a small ear canal. Not only do they constantly fall out, but the sound quality - specifically, the bass response - depends upon the fit, so no fit equals awful, tinny sound. Also, the asymmetrical cord is completely lame. I've owned various Sennheiser headphones over the year, these are the first disappointment, but a big one."
2,Unbalanced Response,"Sennheiser brands this item with the phrase ""Bass-Driven Sound,"" which is accurate if your idea of ""driven"" is ""total frequency domination at the expense of all melodic content."" The lack of balance across the spectrum makes listening to anything other than bass-fluxed pop pointless; the volume levels necessary to hear upper-mids and treble from an itunes store m4a file is a virtual guarantee of eventual hearing loss. Really a very poor design, even at this price point where disposability rules. If you actually want to hear someone singing, take a pass on these."
5,Worth every penny plus some,"These headphones met all my expectations, they sound great isolate outside sounds and carry great bass signal.... The price was remarkable, and they are well worth it"
5,"Great product, just hope it lasts.","I have gotten many earbuds and they all break either in a couple of months or a couple of years. Hope these last at least 2 years. Oh and the cord is kinda on the small side, its not that annoying but at times."
3,good one for its price,"A decent earplug for its price, but don't expect too much, the sound quanlity is thin and weird some times"
3,Decent buds for the price,"I wanted cheap headphones that don't hurt and don't fall out during a workout. I don't like the different length headphones that sennheiser likes to use. Whenever I turn my head, they tug to one side or another. After playing with the headphone rubber, I found the largest one to fit my ear and not come out. The sound quality is good for cheap phones. I don't hear anything else when I wear them, which is good because the gym plays music which I don't always like. I also have shure's cheap ones, the e2c. The biggest difference to me is the ease of putting in the shure, and the steadiness once they are in. I think the design that wraps around the ear helps.The big question, would I buy them again. Probably not. I like and will continue to use them, but are too much trouble to put in my ear, and feel like they'll come out whenever I move my head."
3,"Cable was too short for me, I'm 6 ft tall.","I'm about 6 foot tall and the cable is too short when I put my mp3 player in my pants pocket, which is where I put it most of the time, so this is an issue with me. It gets really annoying because the left ear bud keeps getting pulled out when I walk. Sound quality is decent for the price though."
2,Poor sound quality!,"I purchased CX300 and Sony MDR-EX75 at the same time from Amazon at a great price.Some may not agree since everyone's taste in sound is different but...After trying both earbuds, I would strongly recommend to spend extra few dollor and purchase Sony earbud. Sound quality is MUCH better.My $5.00 no brand name earbud sound is about same as CX300.Sound is very weak."
2,Less than decent.,"When I first heard of these earphones, they were praised so well that I just had to get them. When I listened to them, the sound was relatively balanced in terms of highs/mids/lows, but not much more spectacular than any other earphones like jvc aircushions.What really bothered me was the thickness of the cord. The cord was so thin that I couldn't even walk around with sound resonating to the earphones! It was unbearable! And if that wasn't enough, the earphones themselves were so difficult to put in. They kept slipping out of my ears no matter which way I put them. I was not a big fan of the assymetric design, and I am still not now.About 6 months after normal everyday usage and low volume music, the right earbud stops working completely. Dead. After only half a year. I was hoping these to last much longer! And so it is after this pair of earphones that I gave up completely on trying to get $30 earphones and just settle for cheaper ones that still provide the same sound."
3,doesn't last long enough,"The sound quality is OK. The price is very good if it lasts.However after one year, one side no longer has sound.Customer service is non existent.I tried to contact Sennheiser customer service since it was still under warranty.No one ever answered and I just gave up."
3,Sounds thin and treble-heavy,"They were a decent value for the price, but the sound is not full enough, and the treble and high sounds are sharper than the bass tones.They are terrible when running or exercising. The fact that one of the buds has a shorter cable makes it easier for them to be snagged off the ear. I did not let that affect the rating too much, however, because they were not advertised as workout headphones."
4,Very good headphones for the price,"I bought a pair of CX300 a few years ago and use them everywhere - at work, in the gym, running, playing ball, studying/etc. Even bought 8x of them as Christmas presents last year and everyoned enjoyed them. Highly recommend."
2,"Great product, when headphones work","I purchased these Sennheiser in-ear headphones to replace my first set which I had for 4 years. I paid $85 in 2007, but only $33 this time around. The steep price drop should have been a warning sign that the quality would have diminished some. Still, these new headphones seemed durable enough for basic use and they provided the solid bass and decent sound quality expected from the Sennheiser brand. Unfortunately, the set lasted only 5 months before I began getting sound in one ear only (mono instead of stereo). There appears to be a short circuit in the cord. I used the headphones about 10 hours per week with my mp3 player and occassionally with my desktop pc. The only way to get sound in both ears now is if I wiggle the cord and hold it just so. Pretty cumbersome and quite disappointing. This may just be a bad pair, but I will not take the chance next time around. Will try another manufacturer."
2,Rest in Peace.,"R.I.P. March 29th 2012.I loved Sennheiser and their sound quality but I am utterly disappointed after six months. The build quality of these headphones were cheap especially the wiring. I took great care of my earphones and it even had a case. I still have my iPod Video Class 60 gb in perfectly working condition. I am an audiophile where I will sacrifice eating out for a good set of headphones because I do not like to compromise when it comes to quality to my ears. I was very meticulous when I finished using them and wrapped them in a certain manner to avoid them being tangled.Warranty 2 years but don't get your hopes, it won't get you anywhere.My brother has recommended me to switch to Klipsch IMAGE S4 In-Ear Enhanced Bass Noise-Isolating Headphones (Black)Let's see how do they fair in a couple of weeks."
5,The best earbud headphones I have ever used,"Unequivocally, Sennheiser makes the best sub-$40 in-ear headphones available on the market today. The noise cancelling does not require an outside power source, yet the design of the earbuds reduces or eliminates ambient noise. The over-the-neck wiring can be awkward; however, this design reduces potential entanglements and makes these headphones ideal for use in a gym. The durability of the headphones is average for the market. I get 18 to 24 months of daily use out of a set."
5,Perfect for the money,"Earbuds sit perfectly in the ear, very comfortable. Music quality is clear, with nice bass. Quite an upgrade from the Apple earphones, for a good price!"
2,"Good isolation, too much bass, not durable","These were okay as long as they lasted. I ordered them in October 2010 and in September 2011 they gave up the ghost. It's the usual thing with these earbuds: After a while the jack wears out and you lose sound in one ear. As for the rest, they were pretty comfortable, looked alright, provided good noise isolation, but were way too bass-heavy for my taste."
5,Very good product for the money-Sennheiser sets the standard for affordable headphone,"For the money you can't beat these head phones. They block out excess noise, and are perfect for airplane rides. Great sound quality for the money. After feeling how comfortable they are, you can never go back to normal headphones again. This is my second pair (lost the first pair), and would recommend them to anyone."
4,Lasted for about 15 months,"I am not an audiophile, but these fit my small ears and didn't fall out. They were a great value for the money. I paid about 15 bucks for them on eBay not realizing I could have spent a bit more to secure the two-year warranty by buying on Amazon. The left bud just conked out one day. But overall, these were great."
4,Awesome Headphones,"To start off, I'm not a big audiophile. I can tell the difference between poorly ripped music compared to lossless quality, but I don't get into the whole mids, highs, lows and how it makes my heart feel and all that other mumbo jumbo you read about in other headphone reviews. With that said, these headphones BEAT! The bass and sound quality on these is pretty impressive.I bought a pair of J-Labs J3's before this, and they were complete garbage. Not worth the money in my opinion. These blow those out of the water. If you were trying to decide between those and these... hands down, Sennheiser dominates the J-Labs, if for anything, for the simple fact that you don't have to dedicate 30 minutes just to put them in your ear correctly to listen to music."
3,Sennheiser Disappoints,"For years, I have used Sennheiser products and known of their quality and sonic experience. Because of that reputation and glowing reviews, I purchased these earbuds. Unfortunately, I am disappointed. While sonically they are better than most earbuds, they are awkward to handle. The cord is rubbery, and I find the buds themselves awkward to get a hold of and position in my ears. Once they are in-ear they are a good fit and the sound is good, but the rubbery cord seems to attract ambient noise whether it be from wind or the movement of the cords over body parts or clothing. I do not recommend these earbuds."
2,"Good Sound, Low Durability","I got these earbuds around five months ago, they started out perfect for me. I don't know sound very well but they were fine for mp3 on an iPod touch with good bass. The problem with these earbuds is that the right earbud stopped working, it appears the cord connection broke on the inside, since it only works when I bend the cord werid. Overall the sound is decent but the durability is horrible"
4,Great bang for your buck,"I go through earbuds pretty quickly because I run and work out with them so they have a typical life span of no more than a year. That being said although I am not an audiophile I have taken a few diffrent brands and models of earbuds for a test drive. Obviously for below 20.00 I didnt expect a top of the line product but these ear buds look, sound, and feel/fit great. I am very pleased and would highly reccomend these. The only reason they didnt get 5 stars is because I know there are higher quality products out there but below 50.00 these cant be beat. As for the asymmetric cords, I get it, and understand why they are that way, but I am not a fan. Even with the asymmetric cords these earbuds still rock."
1,"Okay sound, too much wire noise","I bought these because a few years ago I bought a set of Sennheiser behind-the-head headphones that are great, so I thought that their earbuds would be just as great.One reviewer of the CX300-B explains the wire noise by claiming that the ones with the noise are Sennheiser knock-offs, and that Amazon is an authorized Sennheiser reseller. Well, I made sure to order from Amazon, not Amazon Market, and the CX300-B In-Ear Stereo Headphones I received have a lot of wire noise, more than the Sony in-ear headphones I use at the gym. And more than the Philips HE591 Surround Sound Earbuds that I used at the office or when traveling, and am trying to replace because the rubber cushions fell off and are lost.If it weren't for the wire noise, I would give these four starts. Instead they go into the box with other useless earbuds."
2,"Good sound, poor quality","I have use these earbuds for merly 5 to 6 times, yesterday I took them to the gym and the right side stop working. I dont know if it is just me or they true are of poor quality."
4,Good Value,"-These earphones are a very good value for your money.-They work well, sit well in your ears. I especially like the 3 different sizes offered, so you can choose your right size. I always have trouble making earphones stay in my ears for other brands, but not this one.-They lasted for pretty long, until I lost them somewhere!-I do not remember how good their noise-cancellation was, but for the amount you pay, it is good enough."
2,eh,"I didn't like the sound of it. Sounds more muffled than pronounced. If it has bass, it doesn't have the treble to balance what you're hearing. Standard ipod headphones sound better than this."
1,They Work At First Then Short Out,"Sennheiser products do not last well. I was given a pair of these for Christmas. By July, I could only hear out of one earbud. I sent them back and the company refused to fix them without a receipt, but offered to send them back to me for $20! It cost me less than $3 postage to mail the headphones to them! It's bad enough when a product doesn't even last a year, but there is no excuse for poor customer service like that. I will never buy any of their products. And if you do, be sure to keep the receipt and warranty information because you'll be needing it about 6 months later!"
4,Great Quality Sound for a Reasonable Price,"Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds produce a great, rich sound while drowning out the rest of the world. They isolate what you want to hear and do it well. They have great bass response and they last for a long time. They come with 3 sizes of earbud replacements which is nice. The only thing I don't like about them is that one cord is shorter than the other for around the neck use. Just not a fan of it. Great headphones for the price though."
3,Lopsided cord is major and only severe defect.,"The lop-sided cord, longer on the right than on the left, is a major defect in the design of this product. Other than that defect, the sound quality is very good for the price range. The lop-sided cord results in the left ear-bud being pulled out of my ear all too often, which has resulted in premature wear of the left, rubber ear-piece which will have to be replaced at a frequency of at least twice the right."
2,Excellent sound - poor durability,"I have owned two pair. First pair: one ear bud died after about 4 months of daily use, I mean, spontaneously died. Like, I was listening, and the sound in one ear just went away and never came back. This made me mad, but I really liked the sound, so I ordered another pair. Again, used every day while I work, lasted about 6 months, one side died. I continued to stay optimistic and said, ""That's okay, I need one ear free anyway so I can hear any calls from work."" Six months or so later, after being content w/one ear bud, that ear bud died. It is quite disgusting. Again, the sound is outstanding, but is not worth much if they are going to die after a year at best. So I am moving on to JLABS which have similar testimonies to this, but at least there is a semblance of customer support as people such as I myself testify to their negative experiences."
4,Great sound! -- Offset cord length :( -- 4.5 stars,"The sound in these is great. Noise cancellation +. Highs Mids and Bass all accurate.Wish the description stated that the right earbud cord and the left earbud cord are different lengths. I hate this design and have never previously purchased a set with this design. It is ridiculously useless, and gets in the way during active use.I still like this set a lot, and the sound makes up for the stupid design."
2,"Amazing Sound, Poor Quality","These headphones sound amazing, I couldn't ask for better quality in sound. The bass is deep and not rattly, just smooth and deep. I bought a pair and was really impressed so I bought a second pair when the right bud went out. I thought it wasn't a big deal, I probably just had bad luck. I bought two more pairs, a pair for me and a pair for a friend. My friend pair started losing connection about two months after I bought them, and a couple of weeks later mine started to lose connection too. It got worse and worse until my friends stopped working and my left bud died. I checked the warranty, since they came with a year of warranty but they expect you to pay a fee and shipping and handling, that would end up costing more than a new pair. I love the sound, but hate the quality of the physical product."
1,very annoying chord,"They should put in the item description that these have a asymmetric cable. Had I know this I would not have bought them. how anyone thinks having the left side a foot shorte than the right side is a good idea is beyond me. This is very annoying. so annoying you can not enjoy listening to music, because one quick move with the head, and out they go. horrid design, and this should be on the main page telling us that this is how they are. The sound seems decent, but I havent had them in longer than one song to get a good feel for the sound. Thats how annoying this chord is."
3,"Good Sound Isolation, inexpensive, but lots of ""cord"" noise","This is a decent pair of headphones. BUT, the major drawback is that there is tons of noise if the cord touches ANYTHING. If you go running you will be hearing a bassy noise from the cord bouncing around that will be super distracting. So I don't really recommend this set for runners or people who do other physical activity. Even as I sit at my desk and listen on headphones, from time to time I hear that super distracting bouncy noice from the cable touching my shirt, my hand, or whatever. With that said, there are positives too: I like the rubber earbud options, the fit they make, and the noise cancellation (with the exception of the noisy cord) and the sound is pretty good. There is some bass, which, compared to many other headphones is a big plus.Decent if you are at a desk, sitting on a train or plane.Not good if you are an athlete who expects to use these earbuds while exercising."
4,Love Them,"I wanted ear buds that I could wear under my motorcycle helmet that would not put pressure on my ears from the ear bud itself or the little arm. These are compact and I can't even feel them with my helmet on. The sound quality is better than any I have ever had in the same price range. I don't have to turn my Ipod volume up as high as other ear buds I have had which saves on battery.The only thing I don't like is that the length of the wire on one side is shorter than the other ... never understood that design. But it is no big deal, just a matter of preference.Would definitely recommend these ear buds over any other ear buds in a similar price range. (I Can't compare them to higher price range ear buds because I have not owned any to compare them to)"
1,Noise canceling with cord noise,"As a commuter I needed a set of good noise canceling earbuds (cover subway sounds). The CX300-B are above average at canceling noise, but unfortunately they create noise whenever the cord touches anything. I'm not sure how anyone could rate them high, as the cord noise is ridiculous and irritating. I found the Klipsch Image S4 to be a superb set, with great noise canceling, and high audio quality. Spend the extra money to get a quality product the first time around, so you don't end up wasting money on the CX300-B."
3,Very pleased - but??,Superb sound - but they must fit perfectly to get the bass response.I find it dificult to get a good fit - you must try the different sized seals to get the correct fit for your ear. I almost have to force them in my ear and they soon 'pop' out.Just used them on a plane and they are great at cutting out the background noise whilst allowing a superb sound quality.Because they are a closed in ear type they are not really suitable for anything other than sitting as you will find that every time you touch / rub the cord the sound will be heard in your ear. Also you can't sing with them on! Again you will find that all you hear is yourself over the music!Conclusion - very good sound when properly fitted but not really suited for music on the move.Beware - there are hundreds of these for sale on ebay and other such places - most of them are fakes.
1,I wonder how good the sound is.,"I think these earbuds sound pretty good, but it is hard to tell. They fall out of my ears as quickly as I put them in. The cord that goes behind the head aggravates the problem, and the cord is too long. Since I usually listen to my ipod on a vigorous morning walk, these earphones are useless to me."
2,"Beware the cord, like others have said","I am by no way an audiophile but I had these earbuds for less than an hour before starting the return process. The earbuds sounded great but the cord is horrendous, the slightest movement of the cord near the plug and the sound would drop way down in volume, create loud static, or one of the earbuds would go completely off. The cord is so thin I can't imagine I simply got a bad pair so I'm going to try my luck with a different brand. Amazon was great with the return as always. Stear clear if you plan on moving at all while wearing these."
2,Not good at all - I have a $10 generic from Target that sounds as good,The audio is very hot. Treble way to high. hardly no mid. Bass is good for an in-ear. I have a $10 in-ear from Target and it sounds just as good. This is going back. Not worth the $30. The standard Apple ipod headset it better and produces a warmer sound.My experience? I have a Sony MDR-V6 which is awesome for listening to music! I play computer games using a Sennheiser PC 350 which is awesome as well.This head phone is crap!
2,Not enough bass,"When I read the product information on these earbuds I wanted to believe that they were very bass oriented. In reality they were dissapointing in that there is no bass to speak of. Recently I purchased a Ipod nano and the earbuds that came with it are much better in bass, even though the dasign of the Sennheiser is much more comfortable in my ears.I would not recommend these for purchase if you are looking for verybase booming sound."
4,great for indoor use,"First off, the sound is amazing. Lows are deep and highs are crisp. Unfortunately, outside sound from the cord transfers easily, causing interference. I tried listening to a quiet song while walking, and the sound from the cord banging against my chest was like listening to my heart through a stethoscope. I tried listening to a podcast outside on a breezy day, and it sounded like it had been recorded on the top of a mountain! These would be great for sitting at the computer but not for outside activity."
2,"Good sound/fit, horrible cord","I didn't realize that these earbuds came with a J style cord. Everytime I wear these, the weight of the cord and or any jostling or turning of my neck causes the earbud on the short cord to pull out of my ear since the main cord hangs directly in line with it.Good fit in the ear and good sound but the cord is a loser and I will be replacing these with something else.Update (06/2011): After using these heavily for several months to listen to music on my phone while walking the cord eventually failed right at the head set side of the plug, severing one of the wires. I replaced these with pair of Klipsch ear buds and have had zero problems with them. They are a standard Y cord and the cord is longer as well."
5,Great sound at Great Price,"Bought these buds for use with iPhone 3G after coming across a review of CX300's vs popular Sony buds. I was pleased with them from the first play. Great Bass response at lower listening levels which is just what I desired. Good Mid's and High's as well, with no listening fatique. Left this pair on an airplane to my chagrin, and realized that to get the full feature effect, I needed to get the Sennheiser iPhone version for both music and calls. Researched the product and found it at a good price. Can't wait 'till delivered. (Have also recently discovered discussions about fake Sennheiser products and pray that I don't fall into this category. First pair certainly the real article. Hope the upgrade version ordered is the same.)"
5,Great Sennheiser earbuds!,"I bought these earbuds to replace the original IPod buds. The Sennheiser sound is excellent and the price is great too ($21). They cancell outside noise, fit great and deliver great sound for the price."
4,Good for the price,"I bought these to replace my ipod stock headphones and was very pleased by the difference in quality in the sound. They fit in the ear canal so you do need to match the size of the ear bud to your comfort or they won't work well.Also, because it fits in your canal, you will find that noise can be transmitted physically from contact with the cord, especially when the seal is tight. I personally do not find this problematic but you need to be aware of this before buying.They are comfortable, relatively cheap and sound good. They are nowhere near as great sounding as my Sennheiser HD-555s, but that is to be expected. Sound is heard by the movement of air - larger displacement provides the means improve the sound so no earbuds will EVER outshine a great pair of headphones - simple physics.Great for travel; better than your ipod phones; good price. A worthy upgrade for your mp3 player."
3,"Good Sound, Bad Ergonomics","The sound quality and the bang for the buck makes these some sweet earbuds. The design is completely useless, however. The left bud has so little slack before the wires' hub that the meeting point hub keeps hitting my neck. There is TONS of slack on the right one, so much that you can wrap it around your head and still have it fit in your ear. The problem is the slack hangs down and starts to get wrapped in itself. From the hub to the plug, there's not enough length (I am tall and like to keep my IPod in my pants pockets, but still, take some excess Right earbud slack and put it there. Basically, the left one won't stay in the ear for lack of slack, the right one bunches for too much slack and I wish they had their act together, because the sound and bass are excellent."
3,Eh,"The sound on these headphones is perfectly fine, but, as other reviews have mentioned, any wind creates a significant sound. I can still hear my music or podcasts, but the wind noise is much more noticeable than my old Sony earbuds. I wouldn't buy these again."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES!!!,"Though the quality sound is good, it is useless when some materials are fragile.In less than one year the inner plastic from the plug broke, so eventually the sound from the right earphone went off and is not working anymore. It was impossible to fix it since it is covered by soft plastic.I will never buy another Sennheiser headphones ever again!!!"
2,Decent Head Phones,Its really not too loud if you are looking for headphones that will hype you up these wont you might want to try another namebrand.
1,Fake!,"What I get is not just fake, its was broken. If You like those, don't buy it here, if You try them and you taller then 5ft. don't buy it at all.Waiting for refund."
1,THESE ARE HORRIBLE,"I tried these for 3 weeks, but they are going in the trash. Can't return them as it was impossible to open the package without destroying it. The bass causes a lot of static. The hiss gives me a headache. The music sounds like everyone has a cold. They also make my ears plug up. So instead I bought the marshmallow kind for $13 and they are much better."
3,"They are ok, but make a constant noise when the cord rubs against you","Maybe I'm just not used to this style headphone, but the constant static noise that comes from the cord rubbing against your shirt really gets on my nerves. I emailed them about it and they said it's normal. Well, that's great, but it's still annoying. And I just use mine sitting at a desk, I can't imagine the frustration if I wanted to wear them running."
1,They don't stay in my ears...,...regardless of which of the three tip sizes I use. Still searching for a pair of earphones that work (comfortably) for someone with small ears.
2,Unacceptable noise when the cord is touched,"just want to make this point clear. It produces heavy noise even when the cord is slightly touched (for example when your finger touches it or the cord moves against your clothing), so it's only for use when you don't stand or sit there totally still (for example on board a plane). Use when walking is not acceptable to me, not to mention exercise."
4,Compact earbuds,Liked them right out of the package with no break in. Great high-end like sound for little money. Impressive bass response. Big Bang for the buck.
5,A great noise-blocking headphone!,"I bought this headphone over a month ago and have been using it while on public transit as well as in the gym. Once you ensure that the fit works well, the noise blocking is fantastic. Except for people standing closer to you to talk, you hear absolutely nothing else. I am used to the cable wrapped around behind the neck now. This may be bothering others.."
1,Overrated headphones,"I found the Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds to be vastly overrated. On sale at about twenty bucks, the loss didn't really break my budget but this is a piece of genuine crap sold by a highly respected sound manufacturer that does not usually miss the mark like this. There are Memorex earbuds available at WalMart for less than five dollars that are every bit as good a product as this. Mine hit the trash shortly after I tried them. Don't waste your money!"
1,seller distributes bootleg earbuds,"These are definitely fakes. I did some homework and found out that there are a lot of fakes out there of this model. There are sites dedicated to the fake cx300s, so shame on me for being too trusting. I compared these headphones to images of the real thing from the manufacturers website, and they are definitely counterfeit."
2,good as itouch phones no better,"cheap you can hear the wind on the cord while just walking have to turn sound up high so you don't hear noise I read this in other reviews and didn't think it was a problem it is. had a set of v-moda's before that sounded great but had a bad plug arrangement, but i'm not sure about the company now. not worth the money. read all the reviews"
3,Inconsistent...,"I've had 3 pairs of Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds. The first time i bought them, they were great and lasted for about a year. Not bad for a $30 pair of earbuds. The second time i bought them, i broke them a week later and had to order a 3rd pair. I received the 3rd pair on February 18th, 2010. Today is April 9th, 2010, and the right bud went dead this morning at the gym. I'm really upset about it. The sound quality was very good as was the noise cancelling effect. I think I have to look for a new set of earbuds...."
5,Charles's Review,I use this product with my Kindle 2. It has very good clarity specially in very noisy environments.
1,didn't last 3 months,"the left side stopped working within 3 months of purchase. terrible for the brand, i have a regular not in ear pair that i've had for years that is still works. the rubber padding is bad so i thought i would replace them with this set and i was extremely disappointed that one side went bad so quickly. I have a pair of j-buds in ear that i've had for over 2 years and they work like a charm, they're not noise cancelling but you can't beat the quality of sound for the price. Save your money, don't buy these."
2,Warning,"Whilst the sound quality is good (as one would expect), there is a fundamental design flaw.One of the earphones has a cable that's a foot longer than the other.That means you will have a loose piece of cord hanging about your neck - permanently. It's rather annoying.There are alternatives on the market..."
2,its ok not so great whats the hype,not that great better than regular iphone headphones but not a bose at all.some songs play good but most are bad on these
1,Never Again!,I feel like I was robbed these things suck! They go so far into your ear they hurt instantly and the quality is like a tin can no bass just tinny high's.
1,Overrated and Un-returnable,"After reading the reviews, I purchased on these units and the sound is awful. The product description reads: ""The CX 300 are high-quality stereo ear-canal headphones with powerful, bass-driven stereo sound for listening 'on the move'...."" Far from it. There is abosolutely no bass on the earbuds I received.Also, heed this warning: if you purchase this, you cannot return it. Earbuds are not returnable."
2,Better alternatives available,"Even with their sub-$20 price tag, there are better alternatives. Considering the average noise isolation and sound quality, and the highly pronounced chord noise, choose a different pair.For those who claim that the chord sensitivity only exists with imitation CX 300s, mine come from JR, which is a licensed retailer."
3,"Sound was good, until there was none","I had these earphones for about four months. They sound great, the music is clear. However, the sound on the left earphone hath died. The problem is, if I fiddle with the part-that-connects-to-the-headphone-port-that-I'm-sure-has-a-name, the sound may come back on for a second, then go back off. It's not a problem with the iPod; other earphones work perfectly. I don't know if it's normal wear and tear or not, but I don't like it.As for the cord length, I think it's fine, and the asymmetrical design is great."
2,right side started slowly to decrease until it died,"the title said it all, the right earpud just stopped working after few months... it all started by volume decreasing."
1,Horibble durability. Discarded after 6 months.,"After six months, the right earbud would cut in and out. Also don't try to listen to music when you're outside since the wind noise makes these earbuds useless."
2,Sound has too much bass,"I will never buy another set of these for these few reasons.1. The bass is so high coming from these that you can barely get any clear sound, just a HUGE amount of bass.2. They broke within a week of having them. The left earbud you cant really even hear out of anymore and the right earbud you can still hear but it lost most of its volume so you can barely hear out of it even when the volume is maxed.If you want crappy sound and a HUGE amount of bass because your a bass lover then I guess for the price it sells for its an ok deal. I personally did not like the sound at all and once I got used to the sound after forcing myself to get used to it they ended up breaking within a week or so."
2,could have been better,The sound of these earbuds are above average but I don't understand the reason for the uneven length of wires that are attached to the buds. The bud on the shorter side always seem to get pulled on harder so it becomes loose in my ear and have to constantly readjust which is very annoying.
4,good headphones,Was perfect for the price - I believe they were cheaper (only 24 when I bought)Durable - I have had these in my pocket and sat on them/crushed them against things/gotten them wet... and no problems.My only problem - the left ear cord is significantly shorter and tends to get pulled out of my ear easily.I have stopped running with these and went back to my over the head(Philips ShS5200-fantastic)But if you want high quality in-ear headphones without the high price (and are not planning on moving around too much when wearing them) then these are it.
2,Too flimsy,"I've owned two of these. While the sound is great, neither have lasted more than 15 months. In both cases, one of the earbuds died completely, and it was definitely something within the wiring as it would only work if I held the wire *just right*. Wish I could recommend them, but they need to last longer than this."
3,Good but not great,"Overall a good earbud system. I have the same over the ear headset by Sennheiser and absolutely love it so I bought these. Two things i wish I had known:1. It has the offset cords for each earbud (left and right), meaning one is longer than the other, I don't like that.2. The overall cord is short and very flimsy. I have other earbuds for working-out where the cords are much sturdier. This one has been delegated to my work earbuds, however I had to get an extension cord to comfotably sit and still have the jack reash the PC headset jack.Sound is good but doesn't 'wow' you. Earbuds are very comfortable with the silicone peice, however I don't like the silicone for working out as it gets slick with sweat and tends to slip out. Fome are better for this use in my opinion.I would buy them again knowing the two limitations above and using them for office use as I am now."
4,Sennheiser CX300-B,These earbuds provide an excellent listening experience with a decent seal for sound isolation. Well worth the price.
4,Decent set of headphones for the price.,"I purchased this pair of earbuds to replace a worn-out pair of Sony EX81 buds which I had abused over the course of two years. The sound quality is fairly good with clear defined bass and adequate treble. For the purpose that I need it for, these buds are a good value and fit just nice. It would have been nicer if they came with a decent cable management solution like Sony's did."
3,Just OK,"Everybody disses the stock earphones that come with your MP3 player. But those that came with my Creative Zen had excellent sound. But they have two other problems: (1) the are external buds which are not as comfortable as in-ear phones, and (2) the little foam-like covers they come with slip off all the time. So I went with Sennheiser because of previous experience. They are comfortable and adequate but leave a lot to be desired audially. But then they are so cheap, what do you expect? If you are on a tight budget and not too fussy about sound, Go for them!"
3,"Pretty good, but a bit fragile","The sound quality is pretty good, but nothing incredible. Definitely not ""audio engineering excellence"", that's for sure. Good for podcasts and some light music listening.They would be a 4/5 stars, but I've found them to be pretty fragile. After heavy use for 4-5 months, one of the channels cut out - luckily, there's a warranty that lasts longer than that, so make sure to hang on to what you need to take advantage of it."
1,big disappointment,"These earbuds strike me as borderline defective in that when you tap or jostle the cord while using the buds these sounds are magnified tenfold compared to my simple Sony earbuds or the standard earphones that come with the iPod. I'd describe the Sennheiser version as noise-promoting, not noise-blocking. If you have to sit as still as a statue to enjoy the sound quality offered by this headset, it's virtually worthless."
4,Great Durability,"I bought these because I was tired of buying all these other earphones that would give me two or three months and then fail out of one ear or sometimes both, including Sony & Phillips, but mainly Sony. I use my earphones ALL THE TIME. I almost always go to sleep with them on and I toss and turn often. I had these model earphones for a little over six months with some pretty heavy use before one side finally gave out. They still lasted a lot longer than any other earphone I had before so I recommend them just for the durability itself."
3,sennheiser CX300-B earbuds,"Pros:-nice fit inside the ear-good noise isolationCons:-wires are too thin, pulling on them a little caused static shocks to come through the earbuds-overall sound was a bit too thin-the asymmetrical wires make them hard to wrap around an ipodOverall: I felt that they were of equal or even lesser quality than SkullCandy ""INK'D"" earbuds ($19)."
4,"Love them, but ?????","I recently bought a set of these to get through minor surgery. They helped immensely, especially in noise isolation. I am a nutty audiophile and found the sound quality to be fairly impressive, especially for the amount paid. Two major warnings have to be mentioned. You need to experiment with the 3 sizes of ear buds. If the sound is thin, try another size. The sound is massively better with the proper size buds. The second warning is that the right side went nearly dead after three months. This was not a result of any abuse. The flaw is currently a mystery, and I will send the product back to Sennheiser for a warranty repair."
3,meh,"could be better, could be worse. look at newer stuff and spend a bit more these days for quality. rawr"
2,Mediocre At Best,$30 for these is way too high. if the earpeices aren't rammed into your skull you hear very little bass. i would recommend finding another pair.
4,Impression of Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds,"I've owned this ear bud set for approx 3 weeks. They seem to perform similar to the standard V Moda earbuds which I also have. Given the street price differences this Sennheiser may be the best buy. 4 stars because I don't like the uneven cable lengths which go to the ears.... this reduces use flexibility(for my use); this also ""encourages"" entangleing when unwinding the cord from the body of the mp3 player when preparing to use. As has been noted in other reviews for this and other brand ear buds it is very important to set the buds in the ear canals to send the sound down the center of the ear canal. Mine were purchased from J&R and were made in China and were well packaged. Quality seems OK to me. I'm suspecting that all CX300's were made in China, but I could be wrong here. I recommend this product at it's street price of around $25 - $30."
5,Deffinitely a good buy,"I have owned good earphones before but I am not a specialist. With that being said, I can state that these earphones are awesome. They are comfortable to wear,as i have had problems with in-ear headphones,these are truly ear buddies.The sound isolation is very good and the sound quality is exceptional. In conclusion,a very good buy."
2,Poor durability,Stopped working after 5 and a half months. The cord is very thin/weak and will fail long before anything else does.
3,can someone please help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i would REALLY REALLY like to know WHY every ear bud type head phones i purchase always die on me!! i am a very careful person when it comes to my electronics.. i take care of everythine i own. this is the FOURTH (!) pair of earbuds i have purchased that have died on me. its always the same, first the right (or left) bud goes, then soon the other follows. it just stops working! i've purchased buds from creative (twice), skull candy, and now these. can someone out there in internet land please explain to me why this always happens????? are ear buds prone to this type of thing? i can't stand it. i'm basically paying 30 bucks to listen to music for about 3-4 months. ear buds are the only kind of headphone i like to use, why must i be burned constantly? f this"
2,Great sound...until the left ear died.,"Like other reviewers here, I had a very positive experience with these earbuds, until one of the ears dropped to about 20% output after only having them for 3 months. Prior to that, they sounded great, and really blocked out external sounds quite well (to the point where I couldn't really hear someone talking to me if I had them in, even if I wasn't playing music at the time). The cord could be a little longer to make them more convenient to use. Overall, though, I have to give them a low rating because they crapped out on me after such a short amount of time (and I took good care of them, didn't yank them around, etc.)."
3,Just okay,Tinny sound--can't get enough bass.Block outside noise well.Uncomfortable after moderate use (~45 min. +).
2,Right earbud failed after 5 months,"Super comfortable. Couldn't tell they were even in my ear. Sound quality was good while they worked. Nice bass and could hear things I've never heard before with over the ear headphones or buds.I gave 2 stars because the right earbud stopped working on me last week while running. I read the reviews of this before I bought, but hoped it would not happen to me. I am not very happy at all. I can't believe they can't make earbuds that don't fail with light use."
2,"Not bad, but probably many better ones out there.","Mine is very sensitive to line noise. When the wire brushes against my shirt, even slightly, it makes a loud sound. So, I can't jog with it. It is good for flights, however, where I'm not moving around at all."
4,Great headphones but not very durable,"Good bass response and sound isolation. Cord is very thin and i lost sound on one of the earbuds after 6 months. Also you can hear noise as the wire moves on your shirt. OVerall, way better than apples earbuds and are quite affordable. Amazon offered them for $17 with $5 mP3 credit."
3,Sound great...indoors,I love the feel and sound of these headphones. Only problem is when you wear them outside for walking around even the slightest of wind will create a wooshing noise that is annoying.
4,Plugged Ears,"I ordered these because I wanted something better than the cheap generic ear buds that came with my mp3 player. They certainly have better sound and can create a better seal so that I don't have to turn the volume up as loud to drown out the noise around me. It may be just me, but I never realized how much having these kinds of ear buds would feel like being on an airplane when your ears are plugged and haven't popped yet from the altitude change; it took a little getting used to. I would give this a 5-star rating, but the size of my ears (or at least one) seems to fall between the sizing of the attachable tips, so I'm not sure if I'm getting the correct seal (which may affect the plugged feeling)."
5,Great earbuds!,"I have owned this product for more than one year, and it still works as well as the first day it arrived. I use it everyday. It's great to know that now I won't have to worry about my earphones being broken or suddenly mute or anything like that, at least not for a long while. You won't be disappointed."
2,Amazing sound quality but poor construction,I have purchased these head phones about 6 months ago and I have to say these are the best sounding ear buds I've ever owned and I have tried many other brands ranging from $30 to $100 the sound quality is far better in the high to mid range but lacking slightly in bass. These produce nearly twice the volume as other ear buds and the sound is bright and clean. They are light weight and comfortable too and I can wear them for many hours unlike other ear buds that are uncomfortable. The only complaint I have is the wire construction. After about 3 months of moderate use the wires got a short in them and now they don't work correctly. I want to buy another pair but don't know if it's worth risking the same issue? Looking at the reviews of other models by Sennheiser this seems to be a general problem for most of their ear buds. Why can't Sennheiser engineers get it right and address this issue?
3,"Good headphones, but I defy you to find worse packaging","I never review items, but I felt compelled to review these headphones. I really like the headphones. I have had a number of earbuds over the years. These are among the better ones I have had and they are a very good value in my opinion. However, I would not buy these again because of how horrible the packaging is for this item. I defy you to find another item that is more difficult to open. It is encased in hard plastic with not place to easily cut open. Plus, given the nature of the product--thin wire earbuds, you have to be careful when removing them. Not a good combination. A fair warning to anyone that buys this product."
1,Save your money,"... and look for something else. These are terrible! I heard there were fakes of these, but hoping I wouldn't get them here. I'm not sure if these are fake or not, but by some of the web-sites I read, they could be. Regardless, I can't return them."
2,Sennheiser cx-300 earbuds Black,"Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black)I rate these an F for function and design and an A for sound quality. The buds are difficult inserting into the ear canal, the left earbud cord is about 15 inches shorter than the right which makes it easy for the left bud to exit the ear frequently and the rubber bud covers falls off the actual bud frequently. All of these are horrible design flaws. The earbud jack wire has a 90 degree turn instead of plugging straight into the iPod jack like the Apple earbuds do. This is an odd and inconvenient design. The material used to coat the earbud wires creates a rubber against rubber sound and is transmitted through the earbuds when walking or moving about. The sound quality is excellent through all frequencies. However I would not buy these again due to their design and will probably go back to the Apple earbuds."
1,Cord Defect,"I ordered this product from Amazon. When I unpacked it I discovered the length of the cord going into one ear was 6 inches while the cord going into the other was 14 inches. A clear product defect. I have sent an e-mail to Amazon and the vendor asking for a replacement, but have not heard from either. My recomendation is select another brand, unless you like to have two different size cords.....da"
1,Sennheiser CX 300 earbuds had lousy sound.,"I was very disappointed in the sound quality from these earbuds. There was no bass to speak of and in general the sound was harsh and tinny. In comparison, the Apple earbuds that came with my I-pod were much better. Well, there was no comparison."
3,good sound - bad wiring,"These headphones sound pretty good for being under $40. They are a little heavy on the bass, but that's besides the point. They worked great for probably 4 months, then the connection to the headphone jack loosened and now the right ear sound goes in and out if touched at all. I only used them while working out with my iphone 4, (they are a definite update from the horrible earbuds apple provides). Still 4 months is not good run, and i gotta give these a poor rating even though the fit, sound, and sound isolation were more than satisfactory."
4,These Senns have great wiring,"I've had sony's, skull candy, apple, all sorts of cheap earbuds. All others have broke. Every time one of the headphones just stops working. These have last 4 months of daily use so far and only the little rubber tail part under the headphone has come off. I've never really gotten use to the a-symmetrical cord that goes around the back of your neck. But since it didn't break i kept using it. I also don't really care for the L shaped connector and prefer the I. Glad both headphones still work. Cable is a good lengh for me. The skull candys were too long."
2,"Good sound, weird cord","These headphones sound really good and I guess that is the most important thing. However, the left side cord is about 8 in long and the right side cord is 16 in long. I'm not sure if this is deliberate or accidental. I contacted the company and have not had a response. If it weren't such a hassle I would probably return them. Bottom line: don't buy these phones from this company."
2,Stopped working after two years,I used these earbuds for two years and I took great care of them. The left speaker stopped working just the other day and I think for $31 it should of worked alot longer than two years.
3,Great buy from China!,bought these for my son because he wanted a pair of for Hanukah. He was thrilled because he had been wanting a pair of Sennheisers. I have ue ultimate ears and they don't hold a candle to the sound quality I get! But he is happy so that is all that matters 2 me.I was extremely happy with the service from a seller in China. I got them for about half the price of Amazon and only $4.99 for shipping.
1,shortchanged...,"came without carrying pouch...as i'm an overseas buyer, just gotta live with it.cord length is a tad short and sound quality is lacking as interference can be heard.thickness of cord seem too thin as i've seen the originals."
3,V-moda bass freq is better,"I owned a pair of V-moda bass freq which broke after two years of ownership. I decided to by these cx300s because they were $16 and a bit cheaper. Overall, the cx300 have good sound quality but isn't excellent. the highs are very good, the mids are excellent, the bass is fair (but much stronger than the regular ipod ear buds). when you put it all together, you get a rather neutral sound. it sounds like a really good pair of headphones, Not like you actually there in the sound booth listening to the artist singing. These are way better than the competition, but aren't as good as v-moda. the v-moda's have a warm rich sound, while these are bit colder. However, these are more comfortable because the V-moda's are way too bass heavy and that can hurt your ears. If you aren't an audiophile and want Good balanced sound, buy these. CX300 are good overall."
5,Light weight and easy to carry,"These ear buds are, well, ear buds. The sound quality is not that great. You can hear the wind whistling in your ears when using them. They are very light weight and except for the minor sound issues, they are very comfortable. You may forget you have them on! These are obviously not as good as my hd 205s, but they sure are easier to carry so I don't mind that much. I would recommend them for jogging and exercising. A carrying case would also be helpful."
5,Good earbuds for the price range,At 20 USD nothing beats CX300 in my experience and it's also almost good as my old EX71 from Sony which cost 50 USD at the time.
3,"Great sound for price, but broke within 2 weeks","For the $15 I paid for it, I felt the sound quality was great. In fact, the sound quality was so great that I had to start listening to better quality music. The headphones also did an excellent job at blocking out noisy surroundings. I was able to listen to music at a lower volume and hear it better. BUT, the headphones somehow fell apart after 2 weeks. Granted, I didn't take great care of them, but I have never had headphone break that quickly before. I will be trying to get another pair."
4,Good earphones for the price,"These are great earphones for the price. Good sound quality. Since they are in ear earbuds, they block out external noise, especially great when i use them on the train.Although I had to purchase a second pair, since the right bud of my first pair just stopped working one day (after about a year of daily use)!But still worth it to repurchase."
4,Better than Many,"This item is better than what you get with an ipod. It's not the best in the world, but better than average, overall a good value."
4,Not bad for $30,This product isn't all that bad compared to more expensive headphones. They take a few days to get used to but then it's good listening. I commute by train everyday to work and these block out the noise while riding and walking through the city. Not the best sound if you like a lot of bass to your music.
1,Very disappointed,"The ear buds on my Zune still worked but the sleeve over the wires was coming apart some. Not a big deal, but when I saw these buds go on sale I thought I'd go ahead and replace mine. I own some full sized Sennheiser headphones that sound wonderful and since most of the reviews on here were positive I figured this would be a good buy, but these sound just awful. It's like all highs, no mid or bass range at all. Extremely tinny sounding with no warmth. I don't normally write reviews, but these were just so incredibly disappointing I felt I should. Maybe my pair are bad, but I'm just really surprised at how bad these sound."
4,Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black),"These headphones have good clarity, sound isolation is decent, however they're not too durable for use in an exercising environment."
3,Great for the price,"I bought these as a cheap replacement for my Bose in-ear headphones and they are comparable in quality. Although the Bose were slightly better, these headphones were $80.00 less, so I think that's reasonable. Definitely a bass driven headphone, so they do sound great unless you're listening to something like classical music, in which case they are a little weak. Great value."
2,You Get What You Paid For...Not Much,"I bought these on a recommendation from a CNET reviewer to replace a pair of Lenntek Sonix. They sound mediocre at best. The bass is weak, the high end is irritating and when I'm walking they whistle in the wind. I am returning them and buying another pair of Sonix. Hope this helps"
4,Not bad for under 20 bucks,"This is a decent pair of ear buds, especially for the price. But if I had paid $50 for them, I would have sent them back.The sound is ok overall, but the bass is a little weak.The cord length seems well-chosen, not too long, not too short.The only real beef I have is when I put them in my ears. The small ear pieces are too small (loose), and the medium ones fit well and are comfortable, but for some reason, the pressure build-up causes the tiny drivers inside them to make a loud ""crack"" sound, directly in my ear canal, which is quite uncomfortable. Once they're inserted, everything is fine, but I have to be very careful to not push them in too quickly, otherwise ... ""CRACK"""
4,Review,As I read on previous reviews I found the product to be well worth the money. Sometime the bass can be a bit overbearing but simply adjusting the position of the earbuds will alleviate this issue.
2,"Great Sound, Poor Durability","The sound quality is excellent with crisp highs, a solid midrange and strong bass. They are comfortable, look good, and provide decent sound isolation. The durability, however, is far below average. After light use, the left ear bud has stopped working completely unless I pinch the cord a certain way. The cord and connector are made of thin, cheap material that will break sooner or later. If you need durable headphones for everyday use, look elsewhere."
4,Great Sound,"For an older model, they have superb sound, especially in terms of Bass. I wouldn't overpay for newer models when you can get such a great deal."
2,Great Product if it didn't fail after 2 uses.,"I was looking for a set of ear buds that would provide some isolation for in ear monitoring, These were great until they shorted out 2 uses after purchasing. Also the cord length was twice as long from one ear to the next, a little weird. Would recommend if they held together properly. I probably just got a bad egg, they are worth a try."
1,HORRIBLE,"I bought these with high hopes and expectations after reading the great reviews for these earphones. When i finally opened the packaging that took 15 minutes to open i was pretty mad, the cord isnt symetric, when the line rubs against your clothes it's very loud and quite annyoing, the bass is't good AT ALL. I mean i had owned the bass frequencys' by V-Moda previously and it has 100 times the bass response these have. The quality overall looks very cheaply made, and the earbuds are very flimsy. Not what i expected from sennheiser. I would not reccomend this to anyone."
1,Waste of money,"I have to say I've been using Sennheiser products for years with no complaints, but these earbuds are a waste of money.Quite simply, the sound is only a very modest amount better than the free iPod ones and simply not worth the cost of the upgrade. More importantly... any slight touch on the wire from ear to iPod gives such a noise it renders them unusable in any situation other than sitting still.Annoyingly they were sealed in a plastic container that took me 20 minutes of dangerous work with a knife to open. How ridiculous.I would recommend this product is avoided by everyone.The seller was excellent though. The product was shipped quickly and effectively and the good were perfect."
4,Not bad for the price,"For the average listener, you can certainly do worse than the CX300s. They sound good for a ~$30 pair of earbuds (they were only $20 when I ordered a month ago) and are fairly comfortable. They also do an adequate job of blocking out the noise from the loudmouth sitting next to you. Do they sound as good as a set of 'phones costing a couple hundreds bucks? Do they block background noise so well that it's like sitting in a soundproof room? Of course not, but for everyday listening with moderate background noise, these work just fine.My only complaint *so far* is the stupid asymmetrical cord. What a PITA. The only benefit I can think of regarding this ""feature"" is it makes it easy to tell the L from the R at a glance. Other than that, it sucks. Sennheiser, please make the L and R cords equal length!"
3,Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black) - functionally adequate,"Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds (Black) are ordinary and adequate.I was going to comment that as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for but since the price dropped about $10 since I bought it a month ago, I have may have gotten even less than I paid for. But I'll consider it my contribution towards the pre-Christmas economic health of our consumer market unless, of course, if Amazon.com is willing to refund me the difference. ;)They are worth $20, primarily because one can hardly buy any headphones for less."
3,"Good sound, but... don't make a move...","These headhpones fit and sound good.My biggest complaint is that I can hear thunder every time colar of my shirt touches the wiers and it is really annoying on a sunny day, because of that I can't recommend them."
2,I just didn't like the way they sounded,"I guess it's a matter of taste, but I thought these buds sounded unnatural and generally unpleasant. I'm not an audiophile, but as far as I could tell, the mid range and highs were muddy and the bass was not as deep as everyone on here is implying. It could just be the pair I got."
4,Great Bass--amazing for the price,"Pros : Noise isolation, Stylish, Lightweight, Good Bass, Compact, Good Value, Great SoundPrimary use : PersonalI am very picky on sounds and own many headphones.This is great earphone for the price.I compared it with Sennheiser CX300B and hands down this Skullcandy Ink'D has way more low end (bass) than sennheisers. It feels like you are next to subwoofers. Noise isolation is excellent. The only area sennheiser won is in crisp clarity but not by much.Skullcandy sounds little metallic but other than that it's wonderful... I'm keeping it for bass and quality sound. Oh yeah, in my lowest volume of laptop, it's very loud... these are very efficient..."
3,Pretty Good With Treble Booster EQ Setting,"I like these okay. Think I paid around 10 bucks for these. With that being said, I feel I've gotten my money's worth, but I do have a couple complaints. I've paid 10 dollars for ear buds in the past that I've liked more.1. On my iPod, these only sound clear with the EQ set to Treble Booster. If not set to treble booster, the bass with sound really bad, no matter the volume.2. The cord length is a tad too short. Another 6 inches to a foot would have been great.3. The ergonomic design of the cord still bothers me. I've gotten used to wearing the chord behind my head, which is fine when I'm at the gym, but when I'm at home I like to have the chord in front of me."
5,No regrets,"I knew about the problem with hearing movement in the wire before I bought this product. I had expected worse, but it doesn't bother me in the slightest. They are incredibly comfortable and I can pretty much wear them indefinitely. These are perfect for what I bought them as: an upgrade to the uncomfortable ipod earbuds. They meet and exceed this goal."
3,cut myslef opening,Great headphones with ridiculous dangerous packaging. Heavy duty plastic that industrial scisors couldn't cut through. I should ahve gotten the tin snips but I resorted to a steak knife and we all know how this ends. I wouldn't buy these again but only because of the dangerous packaging. Someone has to stop the maniacs packaging this stuff. Beware if you buy you will need a saw or metal snips to open this. Plan ahead
3,Warrantee Coverage,"The left ear bud stopped working. Sennheiser has a two year warantee. I mailed the headphones to Sennheiser and within a month, I got them back. Repaired? That's a matter of opinion.I guess you could call it repaired. The plug into the MP3 player was replaced with a very large, clumsy-looking plug. Okay, I can get over that.What is unacceptable is the 8-1/2"" length of cord to the left ear while the right ear cord is twice that length. Not only does it look stupid with a big loop of cord sticking out and getting caught on everything, but it is very uncomfortable to wear now.My solution was to wrap the right cord up with black electric tape at the same length as the left one. Why Sennheiser didn't just send me a new pair is beyond my understanding especially when Amazon sells these for less than $20."
3,"expected more in terms of sound quality, but it's value for money.","i expected more in terms of sound quality, since they're senheissers, but i think my old sony ones sounded brighter and clearer."
1,"Once you move in these headphones, you can't hear anything.","These headphones are absolutely useless. Any sort of movement will make these headphones impossible to hear from, because all you hear is the chord moving around. It's like when you plug your ears, your voice becomes really loud and you hear your own breathing.I took these headphones outside and walked around with them, and I hear wind, the chord moving around, and your own breathing. I do not recommend these headphones at all unless you plan on using these while sitting at your desk."
1,Broke in 15 days,These sounded great for 2 weeks but then the left ear bud stopped working. No more Sennheiser products for me.
3,Good for the money,"Fit snugly and have a pretty good sound, clear but a bit light on base for my taste."
2,I would have rather saved for something nicer.,"These buds can make you think twice after seeing that the reviews are decent. After I purchased them I plugged them into my laptop (thank god I had the volume almost all the way down!) they sounded muffled, and the volume is waaaaay too sensative. I can also hear my processor in the back round when it's working hard... I purchased them from Amazon directly and researched just to make sure I didn't receive the fake buds. Overall I'm not pleased and should have sent them back but I threw the box out.SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING NICER."
1,the earphones started to short out then fell apart in 3 weeks,"wrong color, and they fell apart in less than 3 weeks, I gave them to my wife as a Valentine day present as a replacement for her Bose head phones."
5,excellent enough to buy 3 pairs for various family members,3 pairs excellant quality and sound each family member has a set.Various ear buds to find your fit.Blocks out outside noise.Very durable sons set went through washing machine and you can't tell any difference in sound quality.Highly recommended good price!
5,Best value for the money,"Seriously, the best value for your money in the earbud market. These have been out a while, but don't think they aren't still great. I've had other brands of earbuds, but Sennheiser will always be my favorite. Certainly you'll get better sound quality from their more expensive models, but really the quality from these buds is outstanding and you really can't beat it for the price. The best thing you can do for yourself if you've been using the included Zune (even their ""high quality"" earbuds) or iPod/iPhone headphones is to upgrade to these."
1,Fake Sennheisers..,I've compared the item to the exact same model in store and they are visually different (logo wise). They cost also They also did not work within 2 days of use. I'm returning these for a full refund.
2,Good while they lasted...,"These earbuds lasted about 8 months before the left earbud stopped working all together. I used them for about 10 hours a week while commuting. I decided to purchase the Bose IE2's, a different class of ear bud, and I like them much better. They also come with a nice warranty. If they break in the first year they are replaced at no additional cost. If they break after, it's 50% of the cost to get a replacement. For the money, these are not bad, but I've had enough of the disposable ear buds."
2,great sound....but,"bought a couple of pairs; great price. There sound is terrific; very lightweight (other earbuds I have bought have good sound but are heavy and tend to fall out when doing even moderate exercise) and comfortable. However durability is in question... both failed after about 6 months of daily use. I would suggest that the wires used are not strong enough and the connections to the buds themselves requires improvement. The texture of the wire insulation is similar to a silicone and though very flexible, does not glide over clothing very well; sometimes causing a tug on the buds which have to be repositioned. Sennheiser have a good product here...if they make them more durable they will sell many more sets."
2,Nice buds but lasted 1 1/2 years,"These buds lasted about a year and a half. The sound was good, the comfort level was pretty good, but one day when putting them on the plastic in the headpiece snapped, rendering them useless. I did not abuse them, and probably had them on about 100 times. The durability could be better."
4,"Great, but no longevity!","I've been enjoying the fit, sound and quality of these headphones for two years now. Sadly, the right earbud stopped working out of the blue yesterday. I'm very disappointed."
4,wiring at earbuds are weak,"I think the sound quality is AMAZING for this price. My local store sells this brand for $90 soooooo......The only thing that bugs me is the wiring connection at the earbud itself. I've broken 3 or 4 pairs this way, but for the price i'll buy it again."
3,Be wary of wire to fail,I have had these earbuds for 3 years and it was just until a few days ago that I had the right stereo break on me. The wire is not exactly robust so just wrapping the cable over time can break down the copper inside it. Even after I warmed the earbuds they have a distracting hiss on the sound for low frequency music. It can be distracting. I never blasted these stereos to the extreme on my iPods and iPhone. For my next earbud I am going for one that has an excellent cable protection to prevent one side to fail on me.
4,Decent headphones for the price,I bought this for my teenage son to upgrade his iTouch Apple standard headphones and the Sennheiser headphones seem to have been a good choice. The sound is better than the standard Apple headphones and they've held up very well so far. I'm happy with my purchase.
3,alright,not too thrilled with the purchase as I thought I had bought the next big thing in personal headphone. what you pay is what you get.
4,Pretty good little ear buds..,"Overview: I wanted a set of ear buds that would do a decent job of blocking out surrounding noise in the office. I was in hopes that I would find a decent pair with a mic for the price I wanted. But I am rather finicky about sound quality having previously worked in television and film for many years. As other reviewers noted there is a lot of noise coming from the cable on these. So not the really the ones for that. But for my purposes in the office while at my desk, they do pretty good.Pros:- Sennheiser is a generally good brand for audio products.- 3 sizes of the ""buds""- pliable cable.- Good sound quality for the money.Cons:- No case.. come on Sennheiser, can't you throw in a 5 cent case to put them in? ughh..- the material on the cable does seem to transmit noise from coming in contact with items through to the ear buds. Annoyingly so at times. But predominantly when moving about."
2,You get what you paid for!,"Not an avid music fan, I just ordered this to replace my totally damaged original Apple headset. I use the headphone mainly for blocking the subway noise and catch up my reading in BN. The quality of the material is so-so; the sound quality is a bit about so-so. The blockage of the noise is good though. I am not very good at listening to music so I can't compare to those who always listen to a specific kind of music and telling the difference between high pitch to power bass. But I did notice that it's basically has no difference between my old original Apple earphone with this ""supposed to be better sound quality"" headphone. The fit is fine and I hope they reduce the size of the packaging and include a carry case."
2,meh,The sound quality is good once the burn in sets in. I did not like that the cable wire to each earbud was uneven (right side having longer cable and left side a much smaller amount). These headphones had a smaller cable overall than any other headphones I have owned and I did not like that either(barely reaches from my pocket to ear and i have to put the right earbud in the left earbud to make it work) Going to buy some skullcandy titans and enjoy their 6 month life-span.
2,The cord ruins it.,"I've had these buds for 4 months. Sound is good but the cord design is bizarre. The difference in lengths between the right and left streams, and the thin gauge of the wire, makes for a very floppy and annoyingly uncomfortable wear. I have no problem with the sound, but for me, the overall design flaw is a killer. I actually bought another mfr's product last week even though the Sennheiser's still work.Buyer beware."
1,line hum ruins otherwise decent performance,"I bought a pair to replace sony ex71's (many years old, and great up until i caught them in the car door). I wanted to like these, but there is an unacceptable level of line ""hum"" which basically ruins otherwise decent performance. Cords are too thin and ""sticky"" rubber, which means they tangle very easily. I also worried about counterfeit (bought from J&R via amazon, not amazon) but based on others' descriptions of build quality, etc. I don't think they are fakes."
2,Quality went down,"Around two years ago I got this earphones, and I was pretty satisfied with their quality and sound. They became my favorite earphone ever, so much that I recommended to everybody that I knew it was looking for new earphones. Well after some heavy abuse on my side I end up loosing them.So I went I bought the same earphones, at the beginning I was surprise to see their price went down a lot, but after my previous experience I decided to go and buy them. Two day's later I got them on my hand. I didn't like the feeling of the cable and how thin it was the connector, but hey this just seems cosmetic.After using it for few day's I realized they have almost no Bass at all and the quality of sound it extremely inferior.So now I understand why they where so cheap. Save your money and get something with more value."
2,nice bass - annoying cord,The sound on these ear buds are really nice. Full bass and they fit fairly comfortably in your ear. Problem is the cord. One side is shorter than the other - making it look ridiculous to wear in front of your body. The directions show to wear them behind your body - but running a cord under my armpit to access my mp3 player just didn't work or feel right to me.
4,pretty good,"The bass is only good when you have the right size bud adapters in your ear, the better the seal the better the bass and the less outside noise comes in. I wish they came with a carrying case through. The cords are top notch as they don't stick together and untangle easily."
4,Very good highs and bass is decent. Iphone compatiable!,Very good sound. My second Sennheiser product. Impressive sound and high quality. I was pleasantly impressed that these do not require an adapter for iPhone (original). Very happy with these!
2,Very uncomfortable and cheap design,"I ordered these earbuds a few weeks ago, reluctantly--as I've been unimpressed with my previous experiences with asymetric earbud cords. These buds were no exception--in fact the short length of the cord made them even more uncomfortable than other asymetric cords I've tried in the past. The sound is decent (for this lowest tier cheap pricerange) but please don't allow yourself to be seduced by the price or by the Sennheiser name, these buds are crap. Every time you turn your head, a bud is painfully yanked from your ear by way of the cord uncomfortably gripping the back of your neck. Recently, I tried wearing them in front, which not only looks stupid, but, due to the inflexible cheap material they're made from, causes the cord to rub against my chin or cheek and still yanks the buds from my ears."
2,Falls right out of my ear holes,"What's up, I can't run with these because my footsteps shake the buds out of my ears and the buds are like 'okay' and just fall out and I wind up looking like a stupid dick running like a tool with these flappy pieces of plastic attached to my shorts. They're ok if I'm just in my bed staring at the ceiling though."
2,Not impressed compared to the old MX400,"Bought these as a potential replacement for the MX400, which I love but are now discontinued. I don't find the sound quality to be nearly as good as the MX400, which had wonderful detail in the bass and were smooth over most of the spectrum. By comparison, the bass on the CX300 is weak, indistinct and underdamped, and the highs aren't crisp. The sound quality also varies as the CX300 is **VERY** sensitive to exactly how they are positioned in the ear.Note the cord design with a shorter cord for the left side than the right. Equal lengths have the advantage that they divide any pulling stress equally between the ear. But with the CX300 design a small tug pulls them out of my left ear every time.On the plus side, they're quite comfortable in my ear and I can wear them for long stretches without discomfort.They were cheap enough that I don't regret my purchase too much. Guess I'll have to keep looking for good, not-too-expensive earphones."
2,Disappointing,"I had high expectations for these earbuds, but to be honest, I get better sound with my stock iPod earbuds equipped with Griffin Earjams. The sound on the Sennheiser buds is tinny with almost no bass, unless you jam the bud so far into your ear canal that it's about touching your brain.Also they have asymmetric cord lengths, so the right cord is much longer than the left one. It's weird if you're used to the standard setup with both sides the same length."
2,Not really so good,"I found the sound to be tinny and thin, not nearly as rich as the stock buds that came with my Sandisk m240 MP3 player. I really expected better from Sennheiser.I dont consider the quality of the sound or the construction to be above the average. And certainly not what I expected from dedicated sound drivers, even on the lower end ear-canal buds."
4,Awesome,"These earbuds sound great. They are definitely bass heavy, which I actually like. They do a great job of keeping out noise in the environment since they seal in your ear canal. Not good for jogging, but that's not surprising. Also, you will hear every little noise that the rubberized cords make, but that's not surprising either. Great for trips on the airplane. Wish they had a straight jack instead of the L-shaped jack, but that's purely cosmetic. Great sound quality for a reasonable price."
3,OK FOR THE PRICE,"ORIGINAL REVIEW - I've only owned these Sennheiser CX-300 earbuds for a couple days and so far, I'm not impressed. Supposedly there's a break-in period so the bass that Sennheiser promises on the packaging will hopefully start pumping soon. I'm surprised at the lack of sound quality. I have a pair of Sennheiser headphones that are over 30 years old and they still sound better than these buds!UPDATE - One week later - The more you use these, the better they sound. The earbud size that you select will definitely make a difference with sound quality and comfort. These buds have just about the same feel as foam ear plugs. Give them a chance. You probably won't care for them right away but after a 10-12 hour ""break-in"" period, you will, most likely, love them."
2,Overwhelming Cord Noise!,"If you so much as tap the cord you hear a thundering in your ears, which completely ruins the experience, unless you are training yourself to remain motionless whilst listening to music.Do not buy these headphones."
4,Loving how these are priced.,"Best pair of ear buds at this price range I ever bought. Great sound quality and isolation. I had the Sony MDR-EX81LP Bud-Style Stereo Earphones (White) and the CX 300 gave same or better quality sound, fits better with better isolation. The silicone rubber stays on well. Sony had slightly more bass but I kept losing the damn silicone, and the pair broke after 3 months ( my guess is the wire broke inside). I hope the CX300 last longer."
4,Great value... if you don't mind muddy bass,"If you absolutely can't bear to shell out the money for good earphones, these are for you.After a 30 hour burn-in the mids and highs on these were quite passable. A little bit flat and in your face, but good sharpness for a cheap set. The bass is overemphasized, muddy, and prone to distortion. Four stars because they're still better than other phones in the price range. People upgrading from crappy sansa/ipod/etc earphones will be so happy to hear something close to what their music actually sounds like that they may not even notice how bad the bass is."
2,Received a poor product,"Dont buy from price storm. Of course they gave a refund, but i think the product was a duplicate..i really have no idea what the hell was wrong. but totally dissatisfied with the product. One of the earpieces stopped working after 2 weeks. Sound quality was not all that great and could not find the right pair of earbuds for my ear size. Kept falling off. Wont recommend to anybody."
4,Good buy for the price,"I just wanted some decent ""in-ear"" headphones as the other headphones really hurt my ears. These are pretty comfortable. The sound quality is not as great as Bose or other expensive headphones, but it works for me."
3,"CX300 - better than most, but not the best","The first time my brand new headphones came, the right ear was busted, so only the left one worked. Good thing they were quick to hop on it and send me a new one right away."
1,Beware of xcounterfiets!,"I bought these horrible sounding ear-buds from a vendor who sells on Amazon.Be very wary of buying from Amazons affiliates, you can get burned. These supposedly Sennheiser CX300-B headphones are piece of junk Chinese back alley knockoffs. And extremely dull and muffled sounding knockoffs at that. Try tin cans and a string before you buy ,these things from an Amazon associate. unless you know of them. And their reputation for square dealing."
4,Bass response leaves lots to be Desired,"The Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds should never be confused with the reputation for excellence in quality that has been long associated with the full blown line of headphones that Sennheiser manufactures. Good treble response but the bass response is tricky to connect with. The earbuds need to be positioned in your ear in a particular way to get the best response. The sound needs to bounce off the walls of the ear canal. Because of the need to fidgit around with positioning the earbuds to get the most desirable output, I rate this item with 4 out of 5 stars."
1,Terrible service,"I ordered this item from amazon through DLN Enterprises, and the product arrived promptly and they worked fine... for a week. The jack doesn't actually do a good connection so under the slightest movement one of the earbuds stops producing sound. I have tried to contact DLN Enterprises so they can replace my faulty unit since April 1st I haven't heard of them at all, I already filled a complain with amazon. While they worked, they sounded great... but that didn't last long."
3,"Good earphones, horrible package","Ok, Sennheiser headphones - one the best one you can get. Mine are pretty fine. What I didn't see: one leg is shorter than the other, so you can wear them only in one fashion. Also, the packaging is nearly impossible to unpack, it takes almost twenty minutes and much tearing. Otherwise, headphones are good, as I said"
3,Great Sound - Don't like the funky cord lengths,"I like the sound quality of the earbuds, but do not like the different ear bud cord lengths - the right ear is longer than the other, which is not uncomfortable, but awkward."
4,exellent buy,"These are a great pair of ear buds, super sound, good fit and a price that can not be beat. The only downside is the offset leads to ear buds from the main cord. This creates an uneven ""pull"" on the shorter lead causing one bud to tend to pull out of the ear. If not for that I would have given it all five stars-exept for the poop rateing, what the hell is that anyway?"
4,Quality Value,"These earbuds are excellent. I had a pair of similar Philips earbuds that cost $35, and I would say these Sennheiser CX300-B are slightly better. They sound very crisp and have decent bass response. I would recommend them. Definitely better than ipod earbuds."
3,Decent for price,"Pros: look good, earbud portion is comfortable fit (3 sizes). Sound is decent. Good buy for the price ($20) so I'm satisfied. Cord length is decent. Good audible highs.Cons: the ""Y"" junction in the wires is up too close to my head, very annoying when I turn my head side to side... but nothing an x-acto blade and some electricians tape can't fix. Lows are a bit muffled, but I wasn't expecting much anyway.Note: I use these for working out, my first pair of earbuds so maybe they ALL do this... but the slights thump/touch on the wires is very audible. Makes it a little annoying when working out. I guess I'll just duct tape the wires to my chest tomorrow."
3,Almost no noise cancelling,"I find that these headphones offer almost no noise attenuation / canceling. I work in a office where there is a lot of chatter so I wanted some earphones that cut the noise out. I had some Skull Candy silicon covered earphones that did the job perfectly though the sound quality wasn't great, so I replaced them with these. Unfortunately while the sound is better I can still hear all the people around me at quite a loud volume. This is even after trying the different sized rubber pieces and cramming them down my ear canal."
2,Only for Inexperienced Ears!!!,"I bought these after returning a pair of Sony MDR-EX300 headphones. The Sonys were crystal clear. I was truly floored by their clarity. What they lacked was bass capable of handling an M.I.A or Jay-Z track. Took them back thinking, and taking a salesman's advice, that these would do the job. Wrong!The bass is fine but the mids are tinny, the highs are just ok, which makes for a very disappointing experience. Especially after hearing the Sonys.In addition the cord is built for destruction. On both ends you can wiggle the cord at the points where it enters the connectors. That will lead to a short in no time. One last thing, the sound isolation is bad due to the lightweight plastic used on the earpieces.I wasted money on these, warning you so you don't have to."
4,Great earbuds for the money,"These are great little earbuds for the money! I've had them now for a few wweeks and they work well and are comfortable. My workplace gets extremely noisy so I needed something to block it out. I put on music and these buds block out all the noise even at very low volume. The cord could be a bit longer, but I am happy with them otherwise!"
5,Great for price,"I have tried numerous headphones over the years and have found these are some of the best. The sound is quite good, and the price is reasonable."
3,Not great for low volume,"For basic listening at moderate to high volumes, such as riding the train or walking around, these are great headphones. I've got a couple problems with them, though. The first is that the cord is designed so that every time you touch it or it bumps against something, you can hear it basically amplified in your ears. Also, (and this isn't really the fault of the headphones) don't wear a fleece jacket with these, because you will get static electricity in your ears, which is real weird and potentially dangerous. My biggest complaint is that there is a fairly high level of white background noise, and this covers up large parts of the music at low volumes, and sometimes even distorts it a bit. This makes classical and jazz listening very difficult. If you're mostly listening to rock and pop, though, they're alright."
2,Sound good but hate the cord,"These buds have a good sound and fit well, but there is way too much cord noise. I got these to use on my mp3 player and Macbook Pro, but quickly found I can't use them with my mp3 player because of the annoying noise from the cable moving around. I also don't care for the different length going to each bud; it pulls too much on the shorter side.They do okay for using with the laptop since I'm sitting still when using, but I'll keep using my old Koss buds on my mp3 player."
2,"Sound Quality is Good, Everything Else Sucks","Like the title says, the sound quality is clear and crisp. Outside noise is muzzled out due to good sound cancelling.Everything else sucks.The cord length is three times longer on one side which is NEVER a good idea. I don't want to put it behind my head. The shorter side constantly gets pulled out and is SUPER annoying.Then, after 3 months of moderate use (but not rough) they broke. I want a refund ASAP. I'd avoid these and go with a better brand like Bose."
3,not what i wanted,"I bought these in ear headphones for running and listening to occasionally at other times, but mainly running. The first thing that disappointed me was the a-symmetrical cord. I never saw anything about that on the description when ordering. It sucks for running and any other use for that matter. While choosing my ear size i noticed that the in ear attachment were quite flimsy. They are not extremely uncomfortable, but they are annoyingly uncomfortable to the point that you can't forget that they are in your ears. The first thing i looked for when i put them in is the bass. It was ok. nothing that great though. The first thing i noticed was the lack of mid. decent bass and treble, but crap for mid. These would be good headphones for $15 maybe $20, but not over $30. Bottom line. I am disappointed i didn't return them when i noticed the a-symmetrical cord. I will be selling these to the first person that i can. DO NOT BUY"
2,Didn't live up to favorable reviews,"From the reviews, these seemed like a solid product for the price. Unfortunately, they turned out to be a disappointment. 1) They feel extremely cheap and fragile. 2) They are not easy to place in the ears due to the short, rounded profile. 3) The sound quality is only average. 4) There is static when I rotate the jack. 5) On one side the cord is about 4 times longer than the other.Look elsewhere."
2,A great headphone with a very flawed cord,"Everything that has been said about the sound is correct in the previous reviews. But I'm surprised that more people don't complain about the excessive length of the one side of the 'V' headphone (where one side is much longer). It is literally so long that you could wrap it around a basketball. This makes it very cumbersome for use at the gym, running, etc, where it is always catching on stuff or getting in the way. It is the one glaring flaw that is causing me to sell these and go back to my other phones."
1,not good enough,"I was first contented with this product, not happy but happy enough. Quality sound was good. Not so good: length of the cord towards the earbuds is not the same, and this asymmetry is a little unconvenient. Then after about a month of regular use, the right side was not working anymore. Too bad. It was my first experience with Sennheiser products, and likely the last."
1,Too much cord noise,"I was hoping these would be great for carrying around my iPod, but the cords create so much thumping noise that the earbuds are impossible to use unless I'm sitting perfectly still, which is never. Unless you like to hear the cords bumping up against you, go with another product."
2,Ear pads fall off and are expensive to replace,"I purchased these ear buds 10 weeks ago and two of the ear pads have already fallen off and gotten lost. I looked into replacements pads -- they cost almost as much as the original ear buds. Not worth the time, aggravation or extra packaging."
4,Great Product at a Great Price!,I really enjoy the comfort and sound of this item. I recommend it to others....
4,"""Very Good""","Sound quality is very good and fit/comfort is good. However, the wires are too short. I use these while working and the frequently pull out of my ears when I turn to look at something. Another foot would be nice."
2,Earbuds,"Very poor fit. Had to jam smallest size adapters into my ears to get them to stay, but they still popped out at the slightest tug. Very thin cord turns into a rat's nest faster than most ear bud cords. Sound quality is no better or worse than other less expensive ear buds."
4,1 1/2 years...still going,I've had these for over a 1 1/2 years and still sound great. I'm in Afghanistan and as you can imagine it's very noisy hear...they do a good job of noise cancellation. Got a pair of Bose in-ears on sale for twice as much...I'll take these hands down.
4,Til now....I like it,"Just got it. 1st impressions are good...i thought the bass was a little low, but just used a different setting for the ipod equalizer and got it ok. Really small on the ears, beautiful black finish. Worth the money."
3,Decent for the price,"Pros: Good overall sound, good upgrade value over MP3 player's native earbuds.Cons: Muddy at lower frequencies, build seems somewhat frail, asymmetrical cable lengths can be an annoyance."
2,Poor Fit For Large Ears,"I've been on a quest for affordable noise-canceling ear buds. These aren't them. I have large ears and these work themselves out, even with the large inserts. If you have large ears, these may not work for you."
4,Good For the Price if you don't mind the his,"These earphones are pretty good for the price i paid $22, but be warned if you have sensitive ears. There is a consistent and perpetual hissing noise much like that of a traditional stereo system. This can still be heard when you listen to music at a low volume.--- one caviot ---This is my first pare of in ear headphones, so i do not know if it is a problem endemic to the technology but otherwise the sound is pretty good and clean."
2,Must be overstock....,"Just received these airbuds today based on all the positive reviews. All I am trying to find is a unobstrusive set of earplugs for at the gym....some noise canceling but mostly that stay in your ear most of the time. These sound good enough BUT....it is so weird. The right plug wire is literally 3x (probably like 12 inches) the length of the left plug wire. So, the apex where the to wires come together are not centered thus forcing gravity to pull the left plug out of my ear. I have had the Shure's before but the price was so good on these. They must be a manufacturing reject and I would NOT RECOMMEND THESE."
1,Line Noise Intolerable,"If you move, even just turn your head, noise from the line is intolerable. For me it's a deal breaker, and other observations are moot."
1,Keep falling out of ears,"I received these headphones two days ago, and they constantly fall out of my ears. I've never had an issue with earbuds staying in my ears, but every time I move these fall out. I would not recommend purchasing these."
3,"Nice, but nothing special.",There was nothing about these earbuds that significantly stood out as remarkable. They are an acceptable product.
2,OK as long as you don't move too much.,"Line noise is terrible, so walking with them is annoying. Wires are very thin and connections seem very fragile. Earbud covers get loose very quickly. As long as you don't move around while listening, sound is pretty good for the price. Two of the product images show a case that does NOT come with the earbuds! What's the deal?"
2,Senheiser CX-300 disappoints,"I recently left my earbuds on an airplane. I replaced them with the lower cost Senheiser CX-300. Boy, was I disappointed, and I wish I had saved the price of the SC-300's and applied it to a better pair. However, I have adjusted my equalizer on the iPhone so I can use them, but they are far from Hi-Fi. Previously I had a pair of Etymotic Research ER6i buds, and they were great. Note that they cost considerably more than the Senheisers. The Ety's not only gave great sound (get a good seal in the ear for bass), but they were much more sound isolating. I had to run the sound loud on the Senheisers on a flight, because they give very little sound isolation.Save up your pennies and get the ety's."
5,Great sound! Blocks outside noise perfectly.,"I am very pleased with these earbuds.. unlike alot of others, these are made of soft rubber and they pop right into your ear, blocking all outside sound. The rubber is extremely soft, I don't even notice I am wearing them.. amazing product.I am also happy with the sound quality, nice balance overall for the price."
3,Nothing great about it :(,"These headphones are mediocre.Before I write down what I don't like in it I'd like to note that I also own Sennheiser HD580 and Koss PortaPro headphones, so I'm comparing these CX300 to them. well, to be honest it has nothing common with HD580 except badge. even PortaPros, that have cut down highs sound lot richier than these.so, what I dislike:1. sound is muddy. highs are missing, bass and mids are blended2. hard to insert into ears. you need to insert these really deep. kinda hurts3. as noted by others, cable is physically noisy. when it bounces you really hear it and it is really annoyng.I think these are overrated.I bought it straight from amazon and I did checked, they ar not fake.to be honest, Koss PortaPro's are lot better for 10$ more.I just needed in-ear headphones to watch movies on Cowon A2 and don't brake them when I get sleep :) so these kinda work for what I bought them. listening music in these? - no way"
5,Great Sound from Sennhausen,"I wanted great sound at an affordable price, and everyone says Sennhausen (sp?) is the best. Having them shipped through Amazon was an added plus, since they stand behind their products unquestionably. The first pair ordered turned out to have a defect; I returned them after 3 days and Amazon immediately replaced them. I'm totally satisfied with the sound quality and recommend them without reservation."
3,Carlos Leal,"Conosco esta marca y su calidad hace muchos años y crei que este audifono resultaria como los que habia comprado hace un tiempo, pero no me resulto asi, los sonidos bajos no suenan igual, Le doy 3 estrellas."
2,Unbearably Loud Click,"The sound quality on these is decent, but I can't stand using them due to an unbearably loud click noise they make when inserting them into my ears. I am not sure why, but if you press in on the buds it will make a click sound that is audible when in front of you but too loud when it is in your ear. I can't use them because of this."
3,haedphones,cord not long enough. cant put ipod in pocket and left and right side is different length wouldnt buy again
4,Way to go!!,"I've had these earbuds for about half a year, and so far they've been really great. The only thing I don't like about them is the difference in cord length between the right and left sides, but this isn't a huge problem. Sound quality in my opinion is truly excellent with definitely preeminence placed on the bass range, but that suits my listening style. Compared to the stock Apple earbuds, these are an improvement of several orders of magnitude!! Even though these do not have active noise cancelling, they seal tight enough into the ear canal to block most if not all external noise, which is sweet. Overall, I would definitely buy these again given the excellent sound quality especially at this price point."
3,fit the price point,"Boomy and muddled bass really ruin what could be a decent ""budget"" pair of headphones. Subpar bass is common for cheap earbuds, but a lack of bass response is far preferable to the muddled mess that comes with these.The asymmetrical cord design is a bit of an annoying gimmick as well, though not a deal breaker.Overall, I'd rather have a set of stock Zune earbuds than these... I've been pleased by Senn products in the past but really can't recommend these as an upgrade from anything."
3,"good sound quality, bad durability","These are very good headphones for the price, however the build quality leaves a little to be desired. If I had to do it again, I would probably purchase 2 pairs and keep one as backup- especially at this amazon price.After only a week of heavy usage, the right earbud began 'buzzing' at certain frequencies. It is repeatable with different songs and audio sources.Nevertheless, I am still impressed with the audio quality (the crispness of the mids and highs are fantastic.) The bass is a little muddy and lacking in punchiness, but deep and rich.Despite the buzzing phenomenon, I am still using these headphones until my replacements come (JLabs J2 Premium)"
2,NOT as good as the cx 500,"I purchased these after the cord on my cx500 started shorting out....I purchased these for 1/2 the price of the cx500, however they do NOT sound anywhere close to the cx500. A couple of co-workers tried them out and loved them, but they don't sound good to me even with the base turned up on my iphone. There is way too much ""tin"" sound for my taste, I like treble, but it is a bit extreme. I purchased through Amazon, they are not fakes....BEWARE OF FAKES."
2,Where's the bass?,Does not live up to the Sennheiser name. Bass performance is not a strong point. The wire is way too short and the asymmetrical right and left difference is annoying.
4,Good fit!,"I bought this item after purchasing and using about four others ranging from Altec Lansing to Philips, including the one that came with my Sansa Fuze. Finally, I found an ear-bud headphone that fits my ear canal perfectly and feels comfortable for extended usage. In terms of performance the CX300-B has slightly less sensitivity than the Philips SHE5920, rated best among the ones purchased, and considerable less base and acoustic dimension than SHE5920 also considered best in class. Depending on ones personal taste these latter considerations may be strengths or weaknesses. All in all, for me this item has proven to be a good fit acoustically as well as financially. The Altec Lansing proved to be weakest in every performance category, which is probably reflected in its price, being the least expensive."
3,"Great Sound, Great Noise Reduction, Not Good For Exercise",I love the sound these headphones produce. The bass is good quality. I just went on vacation and they were great to drown out the noise of the airplane engines. The value is also good. Only drawback is that if you run... these things will probably fall out of your ears pretty quickly. I exercise regularly so it was a big let down when I realized that I couldn't exercise with these earbuds. Besides that they are a good buy.
5,CX300 Earbuds,Excellent product! Sound and comfort are both great. Price is far lower than comparable earbuds.
3,Everything is okay except sound quality,"It is an okay earbuds, considering its $19.99 price. But unfortunately, the major downside is its sound quality. I didn't have very high expectation on this earbuds but I assumed it should perform at least better than my Blackberry 9700 Bold's headset. However, the short answer is NO, not much.This earbud performs good on bass range (again, considering the price, actually, not that ample) but has some problem on mid to high tone, rendering quite harsh, easy showing ""hissing"" effect sometimes (I listen CD, APE/FLAC or at least 320K AAC/MP3 so that the source is absolutely not the problem). Overall, a little disappointed."
3,Nothing special...,"While these are okay for the most part, they are not appreciably better sounding than the buds which came with my Sony Walkman E436F. They do seem to do a good job blocking ambient sound.That said, I would like to state for all of the ear-bud manufacturers out there, that I will NEVER, EVER AGAIN buy this design of ear-buds. For starters, the wire that runs from the left bud of the CX-300 to the player is rather short. As a result it pulls unduly on the left bud. Also, the wire that goes from the left to the right bud on the CX-300 is extremely thin, and that length of wire is too long, which ends up mostly on the left side of the neck while pulling excessively on the right bud. And because the wire is so thin, anything that rubs against it, (a towel at the gym, a collar on a robe or fleece), makes an awful racket. What good are specs, when all you can hear are swooshing sounds?I'm back in the market."
2,Really?,"After reading the reviews I expected allot more out of these headphones. They have good sound isolation but that is about it. I was expecting pretty good bass since they are in ear headphones, but it is almost non existent. And when you do play some music that has a good amount of bass like hip hop or electronic music they can't handle it even at modest volume. Mids and highs are clear but nothing impressive, maybe even too high. Overall I was very disappointed. Don't spend your money on these people if you are expecting any bass in your music."
