5,a good read with lots of local color,"This is an excellent novel. It has historical sweep, cinematic action, intrigue, revenge, and amazing detail, especially when it comes to the food these characters eat or watch other characters eating. The local color is particularly fascinating. This has not been prettied up: when characters suffer, they really suffer. We have combat, murder, rape, and torture. The poverty is there, but so is the decadent luxury.Impoverished Russian aristocrats trying to survive as they flee the Reds give the novel its principal subject matter, but the real ""star"" of this novel is Shanghai 1918-19 with its squalor, corruption, and growing communist uprisings. I was a little perplexed that a major plot point was left hanging, but then I realized this might turn out to be part I of a series. I hope so. I'd like to know what happens next to the main character."
2,Very disappointing,"Phony cardboard characters, ridiculous plot, historical errors. (For one, the protagonist sees a Chrysler in 1919, when the first Chrysler appeared in 1923. This may be a nit, but shows how Mr. Bull tossed this off)."
3,A Bartle Bull fan,"I've been looking for a new Bartle Bull title for some time. I enjoyed the three Africa titles; White Rhino Hotel, The Devil's Oasis, and A Cafe on the Nile so much. The had a little bit of everything. Adventure, romance, a great storyline and spectacular characters. Shanghai Station did not quite meet up to these expectations, but was nevertheless well written and had an especially interesting setting. I'm waiting for more Bartle Bull!"
5,Simply Works,"This is a sturdy masher that makes short work of potatoes. I wished it were a little less expensive, but it does its job well and looks like it will last a long time. I like the round mashers better than the wire versions because they reach the edges of the pan more completely."
3,not as described,"the product description includes ""seamless construction for easy cleaning"" -- this is false. At the Y of the handle, the two branches come together into a tight seam that runs up to the handle.other than that - pretty lightweight little mashes but I haven't used it yet so I can't comment on functionality."
2,Hurts your hand,"I purchased this item because of a favorable review by Cook's Illustrated. However, when I use a potato masher, my hand goes over the top of it for extra leverage, instead of just holding it by the handle. The loop on the top of the masher cuts into my hand and hurts it horribly. I never use this item and always reach for my old cheapo masher with a smooth rounded top. If you hold the masher differently, it's probably ok, but not for me. The products is extremely well made."
3,Profi Plus Potato Masher,"After all the rave reviews, I was a little disappointed. I thought the mashing disk was too small and it was awkward to handle and mash. Results were OK, but not better than the wire type we've used for years. Actually wanted the Rosle masher, but balked at the price."
5,THIS WORLD AIN'T NO CHILD,BRAD DAVIS WHAT CAN I SAY AFTER LEAVING THE ROCK N ROLL COWBOYS W/MARTY STUART...BRAD IS A GIFTED & GREAT MUSICIAN...BEING ON HIS OWN REALLY SUITES HIM...HIS MUSIC IS AWESOME...KEEP UP THE FANTASTIC WORK...LUV YA DUDE
1,worst book with typo and grammatical errors,"This is a worst book I have ever read. It is clear that the book has been through any proof reading process. The language use is informal and the book has lots of typo errors and grammatical errors. The table of contents doesn't align with the topics in each chapter. Bad, bad book. I will return the book and ask the refund."
3,"Beware, Corroboree is not remastered!!!","Yes, The True Colors CD is the latest 2004 remastered version. However, this is the 1992 CD release for Corroboree. I'd hoped it was remastered as it not available remastered in the single cd version. That's great if you don't own these already. Otherwise, Beware, as I now have not one, but 2 copies of cds that I already owned. Waste of money!! Deceptive item description!!!"
4,Love it.,A little stiff but I think it should loosen. Love the way it reclines and raises legs. The color may be an issue when it gets hot.
1,Don't wast your money,"Don't waste your money on this, I bought the chair and was not impressed by the quality and then I saw a similar chair at Target for $70 and bought it. I compared the chairs side by side and kept the one from Target."
5,"The Latin is pure, the Celtic Music stunning!","The best thing that I can say about this CD, is that I never get tired of listening to it."
5,A wonderful CD,"I was introduced to Anuna when they performed at a dinner I attended in Dublin. They sung completely a cappella and it was stunning. I was immediately hooked. I hunted for and bought this CD and Cynara before leaving Ireland. (this one is my favorite) My favorite tracks include 1,8,9,12,& 13. Actually, all the tracks are great. These are remarkably talented performers and the music is pure and moving. I highly recommend this CD."
4,Lovely,"Anuna's debut album is quite impressive and full of pieces that are sometimes beautiful, sometimes moving, sometimes odd, almost always interesting. Tracks 1, 8, and 16 are particularly special: 1 for the driving beat (both percussion and voice) that leaves you with a certainty of impending excitement, 8 for its sweetness and simple beauty, and 16 for pure uniqueness.ANUNA is not as accomplished, nor as varied, nor as flowing as their later INVOCATION (1995), but if you're a fan of the group (wouldn't they be great live in a concert hall, say an old castle?) or of Irish music or chant, it's a great addition to your library."
3,"Good, clean fun.","The fine Americans who comprise NP have delivered a serviceable recording. It rocks -- gotta give 'em that -- but lacks in the creativity department. Hard, mean punk metal is OK in my book, but the ladies & gents in NP are more about attitude than rock and roll, looks over hooks. LTEP is worth buying, but falls way short of the hype surrounding the band."
2,Mindless rustic rock; with decent chops to compensate.,"No, Nashville Pussy's crass cover art isn't a clever facade to conceal a group of eccentric musicians with genuine intelligence and excellent licks. Rather, it's just the most lucid way of conveying the message that: ""yes, we are a bunch of mentally retarded hicks who rely on the strength of junk cover art and a couple of well fitted females to hide the fact that our lyrics are crudely written and our chops are only inches above commoner proportions."" So, essentially; fusing the brains of Pantera (without Dimebag's guitar) with the chops of The Offspring trying to do heavy metal. Sad."
1,"I give them 1 star, because I'm being nice","Maybe the people buying this cd should have used that money for better schooling. And maybe the Garage-O-Matic should have been broken, thus saving us from this redneck filth escaping Aunt Rhonda's carport. Some bands are the anthem for a society gone bad, NP are the anthem for shotgun weddings, where the father can give away both bride and groom."
2,"A Supposed Non-Fiction: Long On PTSD, Short On Facts","In ""A Sniper's Journey"" Gary Mitchell (with Michael Hirsh) lays out a supposed story about a small-town Texas youngster, new to the Army, who is pulled into the Phoenix covert program as a sniper in Viet Nam. In fairness, the reviewer is far more familiar with the Marine's program, but this overall story simply did not seem to ring true to a real sniper's techniques and mental processes from that long-ago time.Possibly as much as a third of the book deals with Mitchell's domestic problems with his wives and for filler, outlined a primer on PTSD. All this was ""part of his journey"" I suppose, but of marginal interest to outsiders.We should thank Mr. Mitchell for his 24-year service to our country, but in respect for the fine Army snipers, the great Carlos Hathcock and other 'Corps ""One Shot-One Kill"" shooters from the past, I cannot recommend this book."
1,Beyond bogus,"For any of us that have spent time behind a scoped rifle in the service of our government from military on down to local police SWAT, there were many flags of this book being utter BS.The one that has stood out to many of us that have discussed this garbage piece, is when this trained truck driver goes to the office where his rifle is kept, looks at the optic and describes knowing it is his by seeing that his scope is set ""two clicks south of level"".WTF is that?If you need a serious look at someone who fills pages full of nothing but lies, waste your money here... otherwise, keep looking."
4,Good for business OR personal life..,"I am continually adding books to my personal development library, and this one proved good for both my business life, and my personal life. If only more people could be concise in 30 seconds or less!!"
2,About 30 years out of date,"The author speaks a lot about his experiences in show biz with people like Cary Grant and Hedda Hopper. Clearly, his advice is out of date and his experience is based on a time waaay before the internet. Today, you need to get your point across in 15 seconds or less. Today, we call it ""The Elevator Pitch"". There was no format to really put together a point in 30 seconds. it would have been helpful if there was a 5 step fill in the blank questionaire or something. There are many more modern more relevant books out on this subject. There are a few pearls of wisdom for the absolute newbie in communications, but other than that, it is outdated."
3,"Six Points -- in 30 Seconds, Folks!","This review is from: How to Get Your Point Across in 30 Seconds or Less by Milo O. Frank(1) Know your objective. Know what you want.(2) Know who you are talking to.(3) Have the right approach, the right means.(4) Use a hook. Does the hook relate to your objective? Does the hook relate to your listener? Does the hook relate to your approach? Does the hook excite or interest your listener? Use visual hooks.(5) Subject: everything that comes in between your hook and your close. Demand an action or demand a reaction or paint a picture or personalize or appeal to the heart.(6) Close. Have a powerful close.Tha-tha-that's all folks!"
4,Getting to the Point,I enjoyed this book - he gives good examples of different communication styles and helpful hints. He explains the importace of the 30 second delivery.
2,Good content - annoying audio production,"While the content of the book is excellent, the production of the audio version is annoying. The clock ticking throughout examples, cheezy music, use of various voice-overs split through left right and channels, and other unneccessary audio gimics are really distracting, and actually make it more difficult to follow the dialog. While this type of format has long been the norm in business and non fiction audio productions in the 70's and 80's, I would expect a less annoying and updated format for an item produced in 1999. Read the book. Avoid the audio version."
5,Cheaper than college credits!,"This book is excellent. It's written for the average Joe; no technical jargon -- it can and should be used by everyone. It's a short and sweet read...brief and to the point, it can be read in approximately 1-2 hours. I'm a radio announcer, and this book is one of the top 5 that I insist other people read ... but get your own copy! In my opinion ""How to get your point across in 30 seconds or less"" is equal to AT THE VERY LEAST one half semester of a college course in Public Speaking 101.... and it's much cheaper! This book should be required reading for everyone who opens their mouth in public."
4,A good little book about the art of communication,"What sort of person do you really hate to engage in conversation? For me, it's somebody who doesn't know when to stop speaking.Frank declares that the basic attention span is about 30 seconds, and that if you don't make your point in that amount of time, you've lost your chance to be heard.He then goes on to tell you how to deliver an effective message in 30 seconds.The book is very well written, and only 120 pages long. It's well worth reading."
1,This is 40 minutes long.,"It takes me 30 seconds to eat a whole pack of beef jerky that's been drenched in Tabasco.By the time I'd finished my snack, this CD was still playing."
3,Interesting but fails international focus,"Milo Frank has a catching writing style not letting you put the book down... This books gives some useful tips and tricks how to manage not only business but also everyday situations professionally. If you masters his suggested methods, you get far! There's always a but... Here it comes: his way too narrowly American thinking ignores some important cultural differences of today's world. Additionally the very capitalistic mind clearly shines thru..."
2,Pretty good,I had bought this jacket this winter in the red. The nicest thing about teh jacket is that it is reversable. The fit may not be extra-ordinarily good though. It's a light jacket good for spring.
1,Product NEVER received!,Can someone kindly send me an email to explain why this order was never received? mskeypls@yahoo.comThank you!
1,Chips are great but packaging is defective,"We ordered the 12 bags of these chips. Of the 12, 9 bags were open along the bottom seam of the bag and the chips were contaminated and ruined. But, of the 3 bags that were intact, the chips were like the best we had ever tried...truly tasty."
5,"Oh,yes! and update review","It's heavy and big. The wheel blade is very sharp. The pizza cutter seems well built. I thought about buying smaller Wmf pizza cutter in order to save $10. I am glad that I made a good choice. I don't know it will be dull or rusty in the future but I am sure this expensive pizza cutter will last for a while in my house.Update review: after 18 month , the pizza cutter is still sharp and strong, no rust nor break. Cut like the first day I purchased."
5,Great guide for a deep series,"The Ghost in the Shell is a very deep series of mangas, movies, and TV shows. While easily one of the best anime out there, there are a lot of subtle things that happen. This guide book shows a bit of what went on while making the first season go from manga to TV. If you have seen the first season, and if you have read the mangas, you will be aware that some of the first season's shows came from the first full issue manga. This disc and book is not only a background on the development of The Laughing Man case, the overall theme of the first season, but also how to bring the characters not only from the feature movies, but also from the mangas and make them work well on TV.More of a technical and behind the scene type addition to the GITS world, reading and watching it gives a blueprint on what is yet another example of not only a cartoon and comic book series and why it is as good as it is, but also how to make a created animated world into a great series."
5,Clearing Up Some Confusion,Volume 1 contains episodes 1-19. Volume 2 will contain episodes 20-26. Volume 2 is NOT the Second Gig log book. Second Gig will its own two log books.
1,Very disappointed,"I ordered Enlightened Courage with considerable anticipation. The reviews were outstanding and I felt I'd made a very good decision even tho books on Tibetan Buddhism by Tibetan authors were often difficult to follow. Well, the book arrived, and I started reading it. It was virtually indecipherable. Maybe it's just the translation but the text was almost impossible for me to follow. Apparently others haven't had the same experience and I will give it another try but I read the first chapter and then put it down and started on, and hugely enjoyed, another book that I ordered with this one."
3,She's No Angel,A hardened young woman is mistaken as the new wife of a dead man and welcomed into his wealthy and loving family. Runningtime: 120 mins
3,stainless steel spoon,"This spoon is a nice size, but it is flimsy. I am disappointed in the way it feels in my hand."
5,To Deserve You REMIXES by Bette Midler,TRACK LISTING1) Arif's Dance Radio Mix [4:12]2) Bonzai Club Mix [7:20]3) Bonzai's 'Die 4' Mix [7:01]4) Arif's Club Mix [7:56]5) MK Mix [6:40]6) Album Version [4:36]
2,i didn't understand any of it,if u don't use words that i can understand than i wont by anything like. that includes any future documents or books. very unsatisfying
2,The most basic basics ONLY,"This book is OK if you just want to learn a small sampling of the simplest tags. Attributes, even of those tags that are covered, are never covered in any appreciable way, and there are many things that just keep showing up that make no sense and are never explained (try figuring out what 'method=get' vs 'method=post' means, for instance). I can appreciate that this book is only meant to cover the basics, but it seemed to me that even what I considered the basics weren't included."
3,Disclaimer: I'm in it!,"Probably not totally objective as I'm *in* this film (Jack - the one with the gun on the promo).I think it's good, not great; entertaining. I wouldn't be disappointed if I bought it. I certainly wouldn't want to pay theater prices for 2 adults to go see it, but have watched it more than once with family and friends.Decent plot, some unexpected bits, decent acting."
1,Broke in One Week,Although this product looked and worked nicely when I first started using it. Within one week the clip that holds the phone in place snapped off rendering the holster useless. This is probably a design flaw since other people have reported the same issue.
2,Disappointed,"As someone else posted: Great fit. Holds tight--UNTIL the top just snapped off after about three weeks. No drop, no snag. Just broke off. I guess the phone goes back into my pocket for now. Sigh."
1,Holster for a lost Gun,"Super Price and good fit don't quite make up for the fact that I was able to break 3 of these in 3 weeks. All plastic and quite useable, this holster will break with almost any impact, (ie. sitting down in your car).I can not buy a 4th because I am afraid that the next time it breaks I may not be in my car and the phone will be long gone before I notice.Cool Idea, just doesn't quite work for long."
5,Well thought out,"Contains various bits. (different selections are available) a 6cm (3-1/2"" more or less) magnetic bit holder. The box can be used as a handle.Add a handle (Felo 0715732180 Smart Handle ) and you have a toolbox in your pocket."
2,Mostly C-sites,This is NOT a very good example of the Belgian Cousins from the sixties. Only a couple of hits and the rest misses.The real hits are NOT on this obscure CD.
5,You can use the slime chamber ron on the spell caster.,"Mattel remade and painted the Grifindor Ron for he spell caster.(They even put the painted and remade Griffindor Ron in a new box.)If you you dont own a Spell Caster and Slime Chamber buy both and buy all the Spell Caster figuers exsept: Griffindor Harry, Griffindor Hermione, Ivisible Cloak Harry, Slytherin Moathway, and Grfindor Ron. Then buy the Slime Chamber figuers because the Slime Chamber figuers work on the spell caster."
5,SEE MY 'REVIEW' for the first of these two audio CDs.,"THE COMMANDERS under EDDIE [ or EDDY ] GRADY's baton have been ""re-discovered"" nearly six decades after first hearing the ""Tutti Camarada"" arrangements in 'live' concert, @ Wheeling, WVa in the early 1950's.[Details appear in a highly auto-biographical 'review' herein for the first CD of The Commanders]!FOR: Lawrence Miller - You wrote about the Sauter-Finegan Big Band. Remember ""Sleigh Ride"" based on the Russian song ""TROIKA"" as it was referring to their three horse drawn sleighs, visualized eventually in David Lean's motion picture ""Doctor Zhivago"" many years later!?!"
1,PRICED TOO HIGH,"I LOVE WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING BY BRINGING EXCELLENT MUSIC TO YOUR CUSTOMERS. BUT, THE PRICE ON THIS CD IS JUST TOO HIGH TO BUY."
2,DON'T BOTHER,"This is HORRIBLE for the temptations.Eddie is almost not present.Davids voice is shot and the quality of the song writing is mediocre.I don't know why everybody says ""standing on the top"" is a great song.Even though it's the best vocally on the album it is only an O.K. ripoff of Parliament.If the song were more original it would be only very good.Don't buy this for more than $15.00."
2,Nice try,"This was a nice try, but Dessi is just not the Norma we've been waiting for.....she does an admirable job acting and doing her best vocally, but the voice has aged, and although her stage experience helps her get through this, you do have the feeling like she is ""getting through it"" instead of becoming Norma. I have 10 Norma dvds, and I think the only one that has a true Norma voice singing the title role is the Montserrat Caballe Norma from the L'Orange festival. She is amazing in it."
1,Ridiculous,"I think there is probably a chance that this is the most poorly written textbook I've ever encountered.I was going to hold off giving it a bad review until I got through the class, but at this rate I'm not even totally sure I will. I've just re-read the difference between nominal and effective interest for (no hyperbole) the 10th time, and I'm no closer to understanding it. Bad examples, useless derivations, poor explaining. I only wish I could give it a zero."
1,It's just as difficult as the reviews are saying,"I read the chapters, I know the material, and when I get to the questions I can't answer any of them. It became incredibly frustrating because I did what I was suppose to do and even then it's impossible to go about solving the problems. For a while I thought I was just an idiot, maybe I am, I don't know anymore. I feel like a piece of tape that's lost its stickiness and can't stick to anything anymore. That's exactly what this book will reduce you to.The worst part is is it's all simple math, adding, subtracting, and multiplying.I hate this book."
5,Helped me earn an A,"I don't understand where all of the negative reviews are coming from. The 6th edition of this textbook was used in my Financial Aspects of Engineering class my final semester. Officially it is a 400 level course, but in reality it is more like a 200 level course. I literally skipped half of the lectures (remember, it was my final semester) and still earned an A in the class. I think grades were based on a bell curve like most engineering courses, so it's not like everyone received an A. Since I missed so many lectures, I had to rely very heavily on the textbook to learn the material.I sold the book after the course was over to get some quick cash, but I'm regretting it. I can't remember anything now, and the subject matter of this textbook is starting to be more relevant in my personal and professional lives, so I'm going to buy it again. I highly recommend it as a reference and introduction to real world economic and financial problems."
2,Who in Hell Is Wanda Fuca?,I read the reviews and thought it was going to be better than it was. A little disappointing for me. I don't care to read his other books.
4,I like Leo,"I've grown fond of Leo Waterman and his cast of characters. The writing style and the characters fit - easy, agreeable, comfortable, entertaining - even if a touch glib at times. I find myself smiling at the conversations among Leo and his group of ""bums'.I personally looked forward to picking up this book again although I will not claim that I could not put it down. To me it is a detective story with heart more than an ""edge of your seat"" mystery. The characters are likable and believable for the most part and when the book does ask you to stretch your imagination - doesn't go to far off the mark or at least the detour does not negate my reading pleasure. The plot is interesting and the pace is good."
3,Lengthy at times,Bought this book because I had liked other books from the same author. This is not the best from the author. Deeper than Water is way better
2,Not as funny as it tries to be.,"This book seems to be a Robert Parker wanna-be. The attempts at humor are flat. If you like ""hard boiled"" heroes and gritty mysteries, try ""Spencer"" or 86th Precinct books."
3,okay not great,"Enjoyed this read, like character Leo Waterman, but not the greatest as of yet. Recommend for quick fun read. Shalom."
4,everyman,Loved the character of Leo. His friends are all people I would like to hang out with. Interesting story. Streetwise language.
4,Fun Book,"This was an entertaining book. It was easy to read, and time flew by and before I knew it the book ended. It reminded me of an old time movie."
3,love the title,"being a washington resident, i had to buy this book for the title - that was the best part of the story - actually i did like the geography lesson as they go from place to place throughout the puget sound area. good for a quick read, but nothing really outstanding in the world of private detectives and solving crimes."
4,Fun read,"I gave this book 4stars because it was thoroughly entertaining. I really liked all the characters, which is the most important issue for me, and I didn't have to concentrate too much to grasp the story. It was just fun."
3,"My view of the book ""Who In Hell is Wanda Fuca?""",the book was entertaining . It was a different style of writing from what I am used to. I will read another of MR. Ford's books.
3,I hope they get better:,"I enjoyed this book, but not as much as I wanted to. I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.There really wasn't anything new to find here,just another PI novel.....but....I will tell you one thing, I will read the next in the series. Not because of the plots, but because of the great characters, and good writing from Mr. Ford.The good writing, funny scenes, and great cast of characters saved the day for me. I sure hope number 2 is better. I hope this was just first book flaws, as I really want to like this series.Give it a try, just don't expect to be blown away.Happy reading!"
2,Too long and wanders thematically,I was looking forward to reading this book although I was a critical reader having been disappointed with an earlier book by the same author. No luck this time either. I will wait until the storyline matures and characters become believable.
1,Not even good for a plane ride..,"I wanted a quick read for a cross-country plane ride and got a totally formulaic, unrealistic story with a ridiculous amount of twists. The author's writing (especially about Seattle) is not so bad in parts, but where he goes is flawed.Out of curiosity, I read an interview with Ford where said this about teaching creative writing: ""It taught me that what I didn't want to write were art novels: 300 pages of well-crafted prose in which absolutely nothing happens to people we don't care about, anyway""How ironic."
3,should i read the 2nd in this series?,"If it's just like this one, I don't think so. Reading this makes me realize how fortunate it is to have believable characters and situations in a novel. For example, the main character just doesn't seem to have much of a history, life experiences that would explain how little problem he has killing villians in the novel. He seems like a bit of an amateur detective, and it would've rang more true with me if he didn't kill others easily nor display jackie chan-like fighting maneuvers. There's little suggestion earlier that he has the background for such skills and/or coolness under pressure. There are other such instances in the novel. I'm still giving it three stars since I did manage to finish the book, and am curious enough to consider reading another in the series, but really if it's more of the same, I don't think so."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"This novel introduces the occasionally amusing Seattle detective Leo Waterman and his posse of down-and-out assistants. The book is a fairly quick read and the mystery is mildly engaging, but the characters are not all that believable and the dialogue is neither interesting nor (for the most part) amusing. Those expecting an amusing mystery novel (see Hiassen instead) will likely be disappointed. This book rarely elicited a chuckle and is often outright boring. Not on par with John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee novels in either story or style, but similar in the overall feel as far as mystery novels go. This book can be recommended if you're looking for a quick, easy read. Otherwise, track down MacDonald, Hiassen, or van de Wetering."
1,Not my type...,Sorry...but this series is just not my type of mysteries. More for those that enjoy the rough and tumble language of bar scenes. Sorry I even made the purchase. Wishing I could get a refund!
4,Guess Where This Book is Set,"(Listen to yourself say it aloud, with your eyes closed.)A private eye, his Baker-street Irregulars of elderly alcoholic leg-men, a semi-retired Maffiosa, his addled ultra-ecological grand-daughter, and prose you'll call up your friends to read aloud -- if you can stop laughing long enough. It's also a great mystery.A little heavy on the ""green"" issues mid-book, but satisfying over all.Well worth your time."
4,fun book,"It was funny and an interesting concept. It was Refreshingly different, but still a really good basic who done it.."
3,Who in Hell is Wanda Fuca,I grew up in and around Seattle. This was a fun read in that I was familiar with many of the areas in the book. Living and working in the downtown area I can see the gang hanging out at the low end bars or being invisible on the street. The characters in the book are everyday Joes down on their luck and would rather spend their time having a few cold ones. Leo is not the know everything detective but he asks questions and follows where the answers lead. He has his gang of friends to help him through. As I said it was a fun read.
3,Ok read,"The book was an okay read. I may order another book by the same author. Easy to order, download and read"
4,Quirky mystery,A new twist on your average private eye story. The author has the PI use a group of old homeless type men to help in the investigation. It is also fun to see the action take place in Seattle
4,Engaging,I really like Ford's writing style. Typo's and all. I'm never quite sure 'who done it' and that definitely holds my interest. I also enjoy the humor.
3,The later ones are better,"If you're new to Mr. Ford, start with one of his later works. He got better with time. But don't get me wrong: he's well worth the read. And don't worry - you won't be missing anything if you skip the pilot."
4,Who in He'll is Wanda Fuca?,The reading was slow in places. What I enjoyed mostly was Ford's verbiage.Leo's relationship with the boys was lighthearted and amusing.
4,"New series I have just started, Leo Waterman",I have just started reading this author. I like characters and their stories. This is about a private detective with a drunken group of associates. No Jack Reacher or Barrington Stone.
4,Good book by an author I had never heard of before,I tried out this book as it was available for borrow with my prime account. I was pleasantly surprised. It was a good story that kept me interested enough to want to pick up my kindle daily. I will be reading the rest of the Leo Waterman series over the next few months with my prime membership.
4,I need more Leo books....,"Got this as a kindle-type, and it is entertaining. I believe it is the first in a series by GM Ford (middle name Chrysler, maybe?)It is light, witty, and quite interesting, as the main character is a guy you want to see in the future.I haven't bought any yet, as I am backed up on books as it is, but I certainly recommend this, and I think you will be looking for more Waterman exploits.WOG"
4,The characters were interesting and funny...,"and made the book a good read. The plot kept me interested, although it wasn't one I had to stay up all night reading. I did laugh when I found out who ""Wanda Fuca"" was! People who enjoy mysteries with a little humor thrown in should like this book."
2,Disappointed,"After zipping through all of the exciting Frank Corso series, this was a disappointment. However, I'll try another of the Leo Waterman series to give it a second chance."
4,Leo at work,If you like light hearted detecting you will like this series. It took any pages of reading before this title made sense to me. I am getting the feeling that there are a few more layers of humor imbedded in all this detective work. Leo is an all around nice guy with many connections in town. He doesn't give up on a case. He is kind of like a dog with a bone.
3,A light mystery for bedtime reading,"This is my first Leon Waterman mystery. I found it interesting and fun, but not particularly gripping or clever. I don't think that I'll read another. Too many better mystery writers out there."
5,Who in the Hell is Wanda Fuca?,This is the first book in the Leo Waterman series. Anyone from the Seattle area will love this series since he mentions many local establishments and landmarks. I appreciate this since many authors totally fabricate the places in their books. I loved the street crew and Leo's attitude of living life to the fullest while waiting for his inheritance to kick in. Leo is loyal to his people and the books have great plots. So he sort of plays at being a private detective but at the same time is a really great one. He lives under his late father's shadow but is definitely his own man. This whole series by Ford is fantastic and I am glad to see this first one available since it is out of print and hard to find otherwise.
3,Slow Read,"You know the kind of book that barely holds your interest, this was one of those books for me. it got interesting for me at about chapter 21 so I foraged on to the end of the book."
4,The Leo Waterman series is an undiscovered gem,"Interesting characters and plot. having grown up in Seattle, I enjoy the references to Seattle locations. However, I will say that the Seattle weather isn't THAT bad, all the time. If you enjoy good detective fiction, you owe it to yourself to give this series a try."
2,"Not exactly a ""can't put down book""",The book just never seemed to create interest and I finally just put it aside for other far more interesting books.
3,I bought it for the title.,One Leo Waterman book is good. Reading more seems a little repetitious of the same plot or characters. The title got me to buy this one. A good read. Put a little distance between reading these character books and each one will be better.
4,book review,The Leo Waterman books are always fun to read. They're very hip and usually interesting with witty dry humor. Thumbs up!
1,Not too happy,The music sounds really awful...and of poor quality!!! It looks cute but sounds bad. It doesnt have good music a kid would like to listen to.
1,WAY TOO LOUD!!! THREW IT AWAY!!!,THIS TOY WAS BEYOND RIDICULOUSLY LOUD. IT HURT MY ADULT EARS I CANNOT IMAGINE THE DAMAGE THAT IT DOES TO A CHILDS EARS!
3,Powerfull,"This stapler is very powerfull. It can be a bit noisy, but overall it is worth the money. The stapler is a little smaller than the picture may lead you to believe."
1,Does not work,"This stapler does not function. I was looking for a ""one touch"" that opens for versatility, but this one does not fit the bill."
1,Does not work,"We attempted to purchase via a feature to select from an open package in the warehouse to save a few dollars. Of the two purchased, one does not operate correctly."
1,doesn't work,1. Arrived. 2. Unpacked. 3. Put staples in. 4. Stapled papers 5.Doesn't work. 6. Repeat steps 3-5 a number of times
1,Don't trust it,"I bought one of these from Office Max. It worked great out of the box, really easy to staple. I've had it for about a month now, and many things are wrong. The staples usually get stuck in the stapler, I need pliers to get them out. The plastic part that holds the staple retention slider has completely broken off, and an internal spring has broken off. I recommend spending a few extra dollars for a decent, time-tested stapler."
3,15 sheets? No way. Not even close.,"7 to 10 sheets. That's about it. Get premium staples for this one. Otherwise, it's a nice design. Looks good. Fits well in your hand. Light weight. Staples with a satisfying ""POP"" like a staple gun."
2,Half right,"Got two of these for Christmas. One works fine; the other worked OK briefly, then only intermittently. It will staple once, then subsequent staplings are failures. When you empty it to start over, you lose plenty of single staples. Also, when you reload the staples by pushing the ""thing"" back in place, it causes the staples to bunch up. It's just a headache when it should be a problem solver! It is wasteful, frustrating and a waste of time and money. The one that works is good, quick and easy. I think they're tricky to load, however, and the other reviewer is correct, that when the staples ""fly"", it can get hazardous."
4,Great for the classroom,"This is the best stapler ever. I am a teacher and 150 students are hard on every office product but this one stands up to that! The only issue is that when you open it to staple to a board or something, the staples fall out if you are not playing attention. Otherwise it would be 5 stars!"
3,Worked good until it jammed,We got one of these staplers at a big box store and have put it to good use but when using it to put a sheet of paper on the wall it jammed. Not sure how it did it but you can see inside like 4 staples so the peace that pushes staples down wont pull up high enough to push down and ratchet a new staple down. Also there is no way to get into that area were the jam is to fix it. I may buy another one of these.
1,Broke after 3 1/2 months of use,"Bought to replace my 25 year old Swingline stapler that was hit and miss. This PaperPro is cheaply made. Broke after using for 3 1/2 months. Some staplers stop working well after using for a while, but this one just plain stopped working."
3,Nice little stapler but......,"it is not jam free. Not only did it jam but some part of the mechanism on the inside of the stapler broke and the two halves kept trying to separate. However, for the money it is still a good little stapler if you don't mind buying another after a year or so."
4,Great stapler. will never use anything else!,"I received my stapler is a perfect condition. It does it's job in a perfect way. Nice color. Nice design. But my little complain is that it needs little effort (more than 1 finger) to press it completely to staple.All in all. Great product. Will never use a regular stapler again.[UPDATE] July 22, 2010.Been using it since I got it and it's still working. the spring isnide became more easy to use now. and can use 1 finger to finish the job :)"
3,Works well,"I would give it 5 stars, but there is visible rust on the finish which was painted over. It was supposed to be a new product but it seems used and refurbished. It functions perfectly however."
2,Waste of Money,"Well, it doesn't work correctly after only 6 months of light use. The drivers don't work right. The scan function doesn't work properly and now I have to replace it with another brand.The customer service at Lexmark is dreadful."
2,Back off... find something else,"Nothing interesting in this movie... The actors not good looking enough and the story is not happy ending... I don't like that kind of story. Well, you can't say it's not ending, but... this drama has a BAD ENDING ! And that's SUCK ! So forget it !"
3,Like the skirt but over priced...,"I love the skirt, but it was too big and over priced. It is a costumeand not handmade. I would have paid about $19.99 for it and that would have been a good deal. I think that the skirt was a little short for a poodle skirt. Everything arrived very wrinkled and I had to take it to the dry cleaners to steam out. This is the trouble with the internet purchases, you can't tell quality when you buy."
3,poodle skirt,"I ordered my normal size and followed chart but skirt is still a little bit too big. Seems really bulky around the waist. Design, material, and everything else is good."
3,Poodle Skirt,Love the poodle on the skirt. Didn't like how the skirt was too big. It was larger then the scale said it would be. I did't like how it was packaged. The packaging effected the shape of the skirt. It needed to be iron to fix it shape. There then areas in the materal.
1,A Message To The Surviving Members,"Why don't you stop beating around the bush, Paul, Ringo and you also got to include Yoko as well. Put this album back into print in America. Also while you're at it, 'The Capitol Recordings' is incomplete, what about 'Yesterday and Today' as well as the others that had mono version albums as well. Pretty irritating. Also, I would not buy this album from this manufacturer, don't trust it and too expensive."
5,"For the price, they're tough to beat","I use these on my Martin Backpacker, because it requires extra light string and I can't seem to keep from breaking strings. I don't to go broke using premium coated strings if they're just going to break, so I stick with these guys. They sound nice enough until one or two break, then it's time for a new set anyway. For a daily ""workhorse"" type of string, for a guy who just sits around on the porch strumming and picking little ditties, these are great strings. If you're doing gigs and playing live? maybe you want to upgrade, I don't know. I happen to think that how you play the guitar matters a good deal more than what strings are on it."
5,Beautiful poster,I have this poster on the wall of my office just because the last guy in my office left it there. I get a ton of compliments on it. It's very moody and Art Deco. For five bucks how can you go wrong?
3,Hard-to-find the music,"Tried to play this on my computer and all I could get was written info on the CD-no music! Finally had to ask the seller of this item and write down instructions on how to get it to PLAY. As always, Jennifer's voice is beautiful, altho I don't like this as well as prior album."
5,WMF Stailesss 15-inch skimmer,I bought this for my husband. He says it works GREAT!!!! Picks up small things and Fries very well. VERY GOOD QUALITY.
2,Too big and too small? Is that possible?,"The size between the holes is too large to scoop out pasta from the boiling water and the bowl of the ladle is too small to snatch up more than one or two chunks of vegetable. I replaced with the WMF spider skimmer/ladle. That was the tool I needed, not this one."
1,Don't Bother,"As an aspiring screenwriter I looked forward to watching this documentary. I was quickly disappointed. It starts out recounting the dismal chances any screenwriter has of ever selling a script and then goes downhill from there. The doc follows three aspiring screenwriters on their quest to sell their scripts. Interspersed are ""interviews"" with professional screenwriters where they mostly whine about how terrible the job is. The video and sound quality are also pretty bad. This movie is a complete downer. Unless you want to quit writing screenplays, do not watch this one."
4,Depressing,This is not the feel good documentary of the year. This is both revealing and gut wrenchingly sad. Not as sad asConfessions of a Superherobut still sad.The doc follows three screenwriters in various stages of getting their work made into movies. One of them gets to that point but his work is so re-written that he feels its been bastardized...Worth watching.
5,Only time I could say getting parasite was a good thing,The order was upgraded for free when I contacted the seller asking for a tracking code and they found out I was a student. Great service!
2,Preferred something better,"Amazon claimed this would fit my Chevy S-10 pickup but it is too wide even after trimming the outside sections. Since one-piece mats are hard to find and I wanted to cover the center hump, I decided to modify this one. I had to cut it into 3 pieces and trim them down to fit. They fit OK but are now three pieces, not one. Also, when you open the box, the rubber smell will knock you over. After scrubbing these relentlessly, they still smell like rubber. I have had these in my car for about a month and if I leave my windows shut overnight, it wreaks of rubber smell. I would suggest looking elsewhere for a better solution."
3,It's a text book...,"Required reading for MBA class. As far as textbooks go, I've read worse. It's not like I could read this front to back like a novel, but I never dreaded doing my assigned readings... so there's that..."
1,Elementary Arabic: A Grammar,"This book is not for beginners and it is not very useful for selfstuding. I would say that this book is more interesting for linguists, or for people, who already has good knowledge of Arabic grammar and likes to refresh it. Also this book was written almost century ago...Unica2004_7"
4,super sturdy,"bought this for my first iPod because I was paranoid about dropping it.I dropped the damn thing all the time.the case got a little dinged and scratched up, but the iPod remains in pristine condition.this thing would survive a nuclear war.it also fit really well into my pocket and slid in and out with no problem.minor complaints - you have to bend the top clip just slightly from time to time to make sure it doesn't flip open. when I'd drop it, sometimes the iPod would come tumbling out. also, the soft cover over the controls left a sticky residue on the click wheel.oh fancy problems of the mid 2000's."
4,Very well put together,"I've been very happy with this case. A little more expensive than average but appears to protect the iPod well. Don't have much to add from the previous reviews. I would give it 5 stars, except the case is too big to fit in a universal dock, so I have to take the iPod out to dock it. The openings fit fine for all cables I have used."
3,Before And After Writing,"In case no one takes Eno seriously anymore, and it appears some don't (never mind that I'm writing this admittedly brief review), read very, very carefully the enclosed lengthy essay on Eno's music and oblique methods by one CSJ Bofop. Done already? Wow. Okay, now write the name out. Done? Okay, now replace each letter in the name with the one immediately preceding it in the alphabet. Man, is this guy a genius or what? Makes you wonder."
2,Eno Fan on Thursday Afternoon,I purchased this CD based upon the other Amazon reviews. I listen to Eno's ambient music often and I do not compare this CD to The Pearl or Neroli which both are excellent. Thursday Afternoon has a background tone that lasts throughout the CD. I find it very distracting and must be in a different room so I do not hear it. Really too bad because without the tone the CD would be great.
5,At the summit of Ambient Mountain,"I first heard excerpts of Thursday Afternoon during college in the 80's on WNYC's New Sounds program.The strongest effect this music has on me is to allow (or perhaps cause) me to recall the many passive, contemplative moments I enjoyed (often without realizing it) in my childhood. I mean memories like listening to the mysterious sound of distant birds calling in dark woods on a dreary day (when I didn't have work, money, social injustice, my libido, schedules, etc., cluttering my mind). Thursday Afternoon has the ability to bring me back into such a frame of mind, and so for that unique, wonderful aspect of this disc, I give it a rare 5 stars. I think Eno is a genius based on this disc alone.Beware, your brain probably needs to be wired somewhat like mine to ""get"" this disc. Not to claim that I'm smarter than anyone...just that I tend to like to stop and smell the flowers, or something like that. Otherwise, I suppose it could sound like a waste of time."
2,For die hard fans only,"I read on Wikipedia that ""Thursday Afternoon"" was the soundtrack to a video production of the same title back in 1984. Haven't seen the video, maybe it was innovative, but the soundtrack by itself is, in my opinion, not very interesting: a single track consisting 60 minutes of more of the same. Musically, ""Thursday Afternoon"" brings nothing new in Eno's discography.I usually enjoy Eno's work, but this one was a big deception for me."
4,Extended work.,"Having spent the past several years exploring a somewhat more theme-based form of ambient composition, ""Thursday Afternoon"" is in many ways a return to form for Brian Eno, embracing instead the structure of ""Discreet Music"" and ""Music For Airports""-- there are multiple themes that are complimentary and of varying lengths that are repeated at uneven intervals. The results are remarkably astounding.The sound of ""Thursday Afternoon"" is quiet, relaxed, almost soporific. A haze exists in the background, with the melody sounding like a gentle electric piano. What it somehow manages to do is convey in its lack of intrigue exactly that-- it holds your interest, remarkably for the over an hour of length that it stretches.Because ""Thursday Afternoon"" is one extended composition, it may be harder to digest than other works. Nonetheless, its a fine piece worth investigation for any fan of ambient music."
4,Good for quiet time,"I was looking for a music-only CD to play while learning to sit still for a half hour daily to reduce stress. I like this CD because it is not as light and fluffy as a lot of meditation-type music. It's interesting and thought-provoking. It seems serious yet hopeful, if that makes any sense at all. Leaves me with a good feeling."
4,I'm pleased with this spatula.,"Glad I bought this one (as well as the WMF Stainless Skimmer. Like the skimmer, it's well-made, not shoddy; it's a great size and shape; and it's aesthetically pleasing. A solid choice - I've been using it every day."
4,I like the whole line,"I have many pieces in the Profi line and like them a lot, though I wish the plastic tipped ones held up to heat better. This is a nice normal size, not too long, nor too short."
5,Excellent all around turner,"Slender and flexible enough to turn delicate items. Strong and sturdy enough to use with moderately heavy food items, e.g small to medium sized steaks etc. After buying this item a few months ago, it quickly became indispensable. Easy to use, easy to clean."
5,THIN!,This spatula is super thin (but not flimsy)!!! Unlike many other turners this one is thin so it slides under everything easily. rather than ruining them like many thicker turners. A great buy!
5,Great cooking utensils,"We replaced 40-year old cooking utensils with the WMF Profi line - two nonstick spatulas, one stainless spatula, two stainless serving spoons, a serving fork, and a soup ladle. We have a small kitchen and found Caphalon and Oxo products too big and bulky. The WMF Profi products are small while still being substantial and well-made. We have been using them for about a month. They are balanced, easy to hold and work well. This spatula is strong, yet still flexible. We're impressed with this line and are likely to buy more."
4,Quality spatula,"A little more money that the average spatula, but very nice. Another example of ""you get what you pay for""."
5,One Of The Most Important Tool In The Kitchen,"One Of The Most Important Tool In The KitchenExcellent QualityNot Heavy And Well MadeEasy For Use , Comfortable GripIt Has Just The Right SizeWe Are Very Pleased With ItThank You"
5,Surreal journey of passage in the Southwest,"I hate most poets, but I love out-of-whack word juxtapositioning and eerie language. This nugget of a book transported me into the movie ""The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez"" as it might have been directed by Luis Bunuel -- starring Neal Cassidy, and with additional dialogue by Jorge Luis Borges."
2,"Now That We've Found Them, Can We Make Them 'Lost' Again?","I suppose if you're a fan , tho I don't know why you would be, these might be watchable. If you're not, they're stinkers of the highest order, and I don't mean 'fromage exquite' - this is your Daddy's porn, maybe your Granddad's porn, so no one under the age of 40 will find it remotely interesting. Age hasn't been kind to most of these flix, though there IS a bunch of 70's porn that still brings a fond tear to my jaded eyes, but these stinkers don't dwell in that catagory. The video transfers of the two films after 'Gunilla' are wretched to watch, and should've stayed 'lost'. Not worth your time or cash - you'll rip your eyes out before they're over."
2,Low price and Fast service,It is ok.Brand new in Box but Very very Hazey.Good price and Fast service. Do not Recommand to any one.
2,Expected higher quality and more engaging conent,"I expected more out of the books and the CDs. The books are nice but short on content. The recordings are low quality. The children are not native speakers, they speak with accents and simply read the phrases in a monotone voice. The English singer is great, but the Russian singer is trying way too hard and it is impossible to make the words she is singing (which is the whole point of the CD). The idea behind the books and CDs is brilliant, translations of the songs are great, but the rest of the package needs more work."
1,Disappointing,This film did not give a far ranging coverage of the topic. It was far too narrow in its focus.
4,Practical Advice for Women!,"Great book! Gives women the OTHER side of the picture. Shares many of the answers men gave about many different subjects, gives women an inside peak into men's heads! Very recommended! I really liked this book, it gives many ideas to do in your own relationships."
5,Useful,This book gives the reader the other side of the coin. The book gives you wonderful ideas you can do in your own relationship. Start romancing your man today.Writer for BellaOnline.com
1,Awful book,This book has nothing to do with its title. It is more reminds me book written by the HR manager to company employees on how not to behave in public places.
4,Seeing God through the misleading fog of Catholicsm,"This book is fantastic! Easy reading and scripturally/Bible-based. It helps to point out that the way to get to heaven is based on your RELATIONSHIP with God, not on being a Catholic (doing good-deeds, prayer to Mary/saints, confessions to priests, receiving sacraments, etc.). The teachings in the Catholic church brainwash people to believe in things/acts that are not what the Bible instructs. This book elaborates the importance of accepting the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior and having a relationship with Him as your ""ticket"" to heaven. Unfortunately, the Catholics profess a list of things that are not found in scripture. I found this to be a wonderful book for my husband who grew up Catholic, yet became a Christian when he separated from Catholicism...he now has a relationship with God (yet sadly doesn't have a relationship with his mother as she won't talk to/accept us since we're not Catholics!). I highly recommend it!"
3,Istor Professional Sharpener,"The directions are pretty poor. I think I finally figured out how to use this thing, and it doesn't do a bad job of sharpening my Felco pruning shears. It might well be a 4-star sharpener, but the instructions need some help..."
2,Istor Professional Sharpener,"I've used other sharpeners before, basicly electric. I am not use to hand shapening a tool. It is hard work depending on the metal used. I thought for the money this sharpener cost that a sheath or holder would come with it also. The sharpener is ok but I would not suggest someone to purchase it."
2,maybe it's just me...,"but I don't think this spatula is worth the $14.99 I paid for it. It is not ""non stick"" for me, even my eggs stick to it. It's not the right angle for me - the little lip at the front is annoying and I just found a spatula shaped exactly the same at target and they called it a ""fish turner."" Anyhow, I'm still on the search for a spatula I love as much as my old one...that they don't make anymore, of course! I would not buy this spatula."
2,Sturdy fish turner,Don't use in nonstick pans. Silicone is too hard and scratched my nonstick. Good quality and nice looking but silicine is hardened on this one. Purchased two and only use them for serving now.
1,Silicon Broke Off Handle,"I loved the look and feel of this turner. I was very disappointed that it simply fell apart after only a couple of months. It appears another reviewer had the same problem much earlier. I have not been able to find a comparable product at a reasonable price but I will not risk this one again. Maybe yours will stay together, who knows?"
4,Does the job better than its predecessor,"Like the title says. It does the job better. It was worth the money.And as for the Non-stick bit, works great.I gave it a four, because, while its a bit better by design than a regular egg turner, its not great."
5,A++ Quality,"This spatula is simply awesome. I first bought one here in Germany a few years ago, and have since bought 4 more as gifts for friends & relatives. After using this unique design, you won't go back to your regular spatula anymore. WMF (made in Germany) is the Mercedes Benz of kitchen utensils, and once you try this brand you won't want to use anything else."
3,Better than Most but Still not Great,I use this with my nonstick fry pans so I don't destroy the non-stick surface. The Turner is ok but still has some flaws. It is not non-stick so when turning items that are still moist sticking occurs. The Turner is also a little thick which makes it difficult to turn but I admit I am accustomed using my thin metal turner.The last issue is that the end-edge of the turner is slightly mis-shaped now after using a few times. This is obviously due to heat but I try to minimize any contact the Turner actually has with the pan.So this is a decent Turner but be prepared to replace it sooner than later
5,Love this -- very handy,"We use this turner all the time. It turns larger pieces of meat with no problem. It is so easy to slide under anything you wish to turn, and meat doesn't fall off it, because it's so long. I have essential tremors and I need dependable, sturdy utensils, and I grab this turner to use every time I cook. Thank you so much for such an innovative, handy, sturdy kitchen utensil. I can't imagine being without it now. Wait till you try sliding it underneath burgers, fish, pork chops, etc. You will be so glad you purchased this. Also, it's a very nice-looking utensil -- very well-made."
2,Through the French Canals,"Although very detailed, this book is geared more toward those taking frequent or extended trips on the canals of France. It's also aimed at boat owners (primarily those coming from Great Britain)as opposed to vacation boat renters. The detail is more on the navigation end of things. I guess I was looking for something geared more for the casual tourist who rents a boat for a week or so and needs details on towns, shops and services along the canals."
5,"A thoroughly ""user friendly"" guide for vacationers","Now in its tenth edition which is revised by David Jefferson, Through The French Canals by Philip Bristow deftly describes and accessibly illustrates 39 scenic routes through waterways ranging from the English Channel to the Mediterranean. Weather information, Hatles and ports de plaisance, waterway signals, recommend-ations for suitable boats, information on locks, the cost of living, cruiser hire, even French vocabularies and conversion tables, fill the pages of this informative and thoroughly ""user friendly"" guide for vacationers and boaters looking to enjoy a grand ride along the inland waterways of France."
2,low-caliber recording quality,"I don't recommend this CD. Not becuase the music is bad, if you like the style, but becuase in my opinion the recording quality makes it unenjoyable to listen to."
5,Great Book,This book contains life changing material if you read it with an open mind. It guides you into easing into mediative state and it is really interesting. I gave my first copy to a friend and had to order it again so I can re-read it again someday.
4,prior experience required,"First, you should buy ""Kimono My House"". Then, become a true fan of the group Sparks. Only after these missions are complete may you venture forth upon a puchase of this historical debut. [Produced by Tod Rundgren][Look out for a used copy of the ""Sparks/A Woofer in Tweeter's Clothing/Plaigarism"" two-disc combo.]"
1,Picture is not the same as product shipped,"Ordered this charger, while it was the same model and had the same capability, got a cheaper version than what is pictured on the site. Charger shipped had the low end uninsulated type battery clamps rather than the nice heavy duty ones pictured on th website ad (like the ones you see on the 6 amp and lesser trickle chargers of same brand). Secondly, was under the impression that the charger had a reconditioning feature, which it did not."
2,It's junk,"Don't waste your time or money - every battery I have ever attempted to charge with this unit results on F03 error code.The first time it happened I took the unit at it's result and returned the battery (fortunately it was under warranty), but now I fully realize the battery was fine, it's the charger that is worthless."
4,"It's loud, and sometimes gives false fault codes","The fan is loud, but it usually charges fine. Sometimes it displays a false ""open cell"" or ""shorted cell"" fault code. Restarting it usually clears the fault. Also it draws a lot of start-up current when first plugged in (a loud arc / spark from the plug is the result)."
1,will never buy black & decker battery charter again,I will never buy Black & Becker battery charter again. This charger only charges batteries that have some charge. If you leave your lights on or something that completely drains the battery this charger gives a fault light and will not charge. A charger that doesn't charge dead batteries. Brilliant design!
1,OK for the short time it worked,Worked ok until the selector switches became erratic. Might work once in ~ twenty tries. Returned first under warranty. Second one lasted a few months and now has the same problem.
1,Display Burned Out,"I use battery chargers often to charge RV batteries. This one sounded good on Amazon and has basically worked.However, a couple of elements in the display burned out after a short time. Now it is impossible to read the voltage or charging rate. I do not recommend this unit. As a matter of fact I really cannot think of a single Black and Decker tool I've owned that has quality built in."
1,JUNK,"Performed as advertised for about a year, under light household use, then suddenly stopped working. Display shows ""spinning"" symbol. Won't charge under any amp setting."
1,Bad Diagnosis - Discarded good battery,"I ordered this product to charge my car battery. I had previously used manual chargers on this battery with success. This charger promises automatic capability and diagnostics on your battery. Upon hooking the charger up to the car battery, diagnostics produced an ""Open Cell"" diagnosis, it would not charge at this point. I replaced with a brand new battery. The new battery works fine in the car. When I hooked the charger up to the new battery to see what it would say, same diagnosis, ""open cell"". Battery obviously is not the problem at this point. Tried hooking charger up to my lawn mower, same result ""open cell"". The lawn mower battery has been working fine. I have no option to override the assessment and still charge the battery if I want. I believe the battery I replaced probably was still good. Don't believe this unit diagnosis, costly mistake."
1,Garbage!,"I also bought another battery thinking that was the problem. After about a year the cooling fan in my charger also started making noise, and also constantly gives fault codes. If you tap the charger or lean it on end the noise goes away but I don't think the charger is charging properly. If your battery is completely drained it will not charge either. Makes sense buy a charger that won't charge dead batteries? This thing is garbage, and has cost me quite a bit more money than just the charger itself. I also believe this charger has also diminished the life of both the batteires I have charged with it. Both are deep cycle marine batteries used for trolling motors.You would think the batteries should last a little longer than two years..."
2,"Great performances, problematic recording","While Kovacevich may not posses the technical perfection of, say, Pollini, he more than makes up for with the intensity of performances documented in this boxed set.What is a serious problem, unfortunately, is the miking techniques used by the EMI engineering crew. I know what a piano sounds like (I have a Steinway in my living room), and the harsh clickety sound of the instrument in these recordings is impossible to circumvent for more than brief periods of listening--I find a complete listening through the ""Hammerklavier"" unbearable for fear of the potential for long term damage to my ear drums.For those starting off with a cycle, I'd suggest the almost-complete Gilels set, filling in what gaps you can with Pollini and Richter (the latter even if it doesn't fill any gaps--his Appassionata is breathtaking). If you're a Kovacevich fan the late sonatas here are better performed, but at least his earlier Philips recording is in tolerable sound."
1,the soundtrack stinks.,"Only if you like the series. Don't bother if you hate the series. The music and the movie stink. In less you are a die hard fan, this is not for you."
4,One Of The Best Soundtracks Ever!!!,"This is one of the best movie soundtracks I have ever heard! It has great bands like TMBG, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Van Halen. I gave it 4 stars cause all of them are nt the best songs ever. In my opinion SenSurround by They Might Be Giants is the greatest song on the CD. I give this CD 4 stars and it is marvelous!"
5,Good shocks,"Made the car ride just a little higher, but that could be because my old shocks were worn out. Good replacement, good ride, cost effective."
5,Bronco pride,"My daughter was thrilled when she received the plate that allowed her one more way to show her Bronco pride. She was very happy with the gift, which makes me a very happy mom!!"
1,I can't believe I watched the whole thing!,"I am one of those sappy people who love France, especially Paris, and will stoop to watch some of the worst pictures just because they are set there. I am ashamed to admit it, but there it is. However if you are not an addicted Francophile, just do yourself a favor and stay away from this. I can't believe that the like of Genevieve Bujold, Geraldine Chaplin and Wallace Shawn agreed to appear in this. They should REALLY be ashamed. I won't waste any more of my time detailing the many reasons to avoid this film....I've already wasted two hours of my life."
3,My First and Last Jazz Beat CD...Never Again!,"Spain's Gambit and Fresh Sound have been releasing reissues that rival the impeccable Japanese editions, both in album art and in faithful original audio reproduction. Unfortunately, Spain's Jazz Beat compares miserably to those proven lables. While Jazz Beat beautifully laminated the original album art for this issue and included all original liner notes, photos and graphics, Jazz Beat's audio remastering is garbage--they added a stereo effect to these mono masters.Also, the CD I received has a totally different track listing from that seen on this Amazon page; it's a pairing of the Capitol albums JAM SESSION AT THE TOWER and I REMEMBER GLENN [Miller].NOTE: the audio remastering of the Aero Space version blows Jazz Beat's to smitherines...and the track listing is as seen on this page, a pairing of the Capitol albums JAM...TOWER and SOUND SPECTACULAR."
2,Mostly fluff,"If you read newspapers, you know the filler stories where they pick up on a current trend and write nice fluffy stories about how it's affecting people's lives. This book is 320 pages of those kinds of stories. I have considerable sympathy with the goals of the slow movement, but this book offers little in the way of the philosophical underpinnings of the movement or suggestions of ways of slowing your life down.It's a collection of interesting stories and examples, but like eating chocolates, while it's enjoyable, it doesn't have much nutrition."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"I bought this book because it was an internatinal bestseller and because reviewers claimed it was the next No Logo, a booked that I really enjoyd. In Praise of Slow, however, doesn't live up to the hype.Honore tries to hype of a movement that really doesn't exist. He gives several examples of the ""new movement"" of Slow, but he gives many, many more of how the world is living too fast paced.The author borrows so much from the writing style of Naomi Klein that one begins to realise he has no original style of his own.Finally, and most importantly, I had hoped the book would talk about the emotional and spiritual effects of slowness. However, Honore flatly rejects ""spiritualism"" in the first chapter as touchy feely nonsense. So there is really no step-by-step instruction on how to live slowly."
3,"Well written, but elitist","A good book thoroughly researched. And God knows how much we need to realize that today speed has become a cult. But this book appears to give as an alternative a cult of slow. Slow life becomes synonym of slow food vs. the despised fast-food, old European cities with cute baker shops vs. supermarkets, leisure time filled with yoga and knitting vs. television watching... Slowing down should be a personal and private choice, not a new trend to display!"
5,excellent book!,"a good friend recommended this to me, and i'm glad she did, it was a wonderful read and i look forward to more books from Risa Miller!"
4,quiet book about a lively man,"This is a book that let's Muir speak yet the small inserts by the author who hand-picked the Muir passages add so much to the reading. Muir was a unique person to be sure - the accounts by people who met him were of a person boisterous, talkative, enthusiastic yet his writings, though enthusiastic, are slightly matter of fact-just in the way he writes, not necessarily the content."
2,Not efficient - purchased because it was dish washer safe.,The head or pounder part of this products is too small and does not do a good job.I prefer one with a larger surface area.
4,Great Shoe,"Very nice shoe, however I should have ordered a bigger size b/c it is a litle more narrow then most. Very comfortable."
5,worked as expected,"Is the second time I buy the same item from the same seller, nothing wrong with the product I just go to a lot of them, worked as expected."
1,Defective headset,I received a defective headset cause the Jack is different and the head phone ear pieces are with different lengths! I won't recommend buying this
5,Good headset for your Blackberry...but,"This is a great headset for your Blackberry (I use it on my Pearl). Sound quality is good enough for music and calls and it actually makes it easier to listen to your phone calls. The microphone isn't great and picks up a lot of wind noise, unlike many of the sound canceling microphones out there.However if you live in California (and possibly other states that require hands free wireless in the car), don't cover both ears while driving as that's could result in a ticket. Either only use one earphone of the 2, or use a different headset in the car."
2,$5 Learning Experience,"Mic works, but nothing else. If I twist and jiggle the connector just right, I *might* get the right headphone to work, but never both. It's never stable enough to actually use.Would not buy unless you've bought before and had success."
4,Good product,"You need the hands and eyes of a brain surgeon to get the foam covers on the earbuds, but overall well worth the money. They sound great."
2,ok for the price,they werent the best and they werent the worst. only one side works although it says it will work for this phone. it would be worth it for a phone that takes this jack.
4,black berry,great product for the price great company friendly great email response and will to work with costumer really good at what they do look forward to future orders with this company
5,Works great for my Cricket Phone,"I bought this to use with both my Cricket cell phone(msgm8) and my At&t cordless house phone. It works great for the Cricket phone which looks identical to a blackberry, but does not work well for the At&t cordless. I was told they could barely hear me and I sounded all scratchy and broken. I rated it a 5 star because it did what it told worked great for a cell phone specifically the blackberry which is almost identical to my cricket."
2,not happy,"I ordered 1 (one) headset, was charged for and received 2 (two). I returned 1 (one) headset but never recieved any credit. I know it's only $4.01, but it's the principle."
1,only works for a few weeks,"I purchased two. The first one broke after a couple of weeks, the second one after a month or so. They are pretty cheap though, so I'm going to order a dozen..."
2,Wrong Jack Size,I purchased this for my BB Curve 8330 and the jack is the wrong size even though it says that it is OEM. I can't even give you a review of the product as I can't plug it in to try it out!
3,could be better replacement,headset looks like the original. sound is okay......but the control button broke down after 3 days use....
3,zoom! zoom!,"It would be much more enjoyable if it slowed down a bit. Watching clouds rush by simply is not relaxing. The shift from one scene to another was so quick that it really wasn't relaxing. Actually, it made me a bit dizzy at times. They'd do a close up of a scene and then pull back so more and more of the scene was revealed. Might have been an incredibly effective technique if they didn't do it so fast! Still, the music is quite enjoyable and if I'm doing something else with it on just as background it is okay."
5,amazing natural beauty right in your living room..,"quick review. There are about 4-5 nature scenes, each lasting about 20-30 minutes. One scene is of cloud formations, another with a active stream, another with beautiful landscapes. Some scenes are filmed with stop-motion photography- for example, the cloud scenes are filmed this way, and you can see the cloud formations rapidly as they are carried across your screen by the winds.interesting benefits: the camera is not still in the scenes, there is some editing (cuts) and camera movement in each scene. It is not a ""static"" frozen camera simply recording the scene over time.another plus is the option to have either music or nature sounds or both playing while you watch the scene. This greatly increases the enjoyment of watching the scene.a great way to unwind and relax from a day of work just before going to bed. Great also for general stress relief.highly, highly recommended."
3,fat skimming ladel,"The design is a little flawed because the liquid escapes through the side of the divider. My dad has an ancient one that works much better. Unfortunately, I cannot find it anywhere."
3,"Works well, but a little awkward","I had been looking for a fat skimmer for quite some time. The old tupperware hand-me-down from my mother had finally gone to the skimming ground in the sky. It is difficult to find a ladle-style skimmer these days, and I purchased this one as soon as I saw it. It definitely does the job for which it was made, but its large size makes it a bit awkward for skimming smaller amounts of fat. Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting good food along with the fat. I like this utensil but wish I would have purchased a smaller size."
4,Lovejoy revisits his past!,"In this book Lovejoy is escaping East Anglia. He's in hot water again. He's been recruited for an illegal activity, he's got women angry at him and his cottage has been repossed. So he takes the first opportunity that he can to get away, and goes back to the North of England where he grew up. He' trying to find Tinker's niece, but he's also trying to get into something that will make him some money. As usual he finds more trouble there, and he brings some of his old troubles with him, so before long, Lovejoy is in big trouble again, and people that he knows start dying. The book has fast-paced action and of course some wonderful characters. This series is a lot of fun."
5,A very beautiful book,"Very beautiful essays. I enjoyed the Chinese translation very much!~~~ When I got a time, I'll read the English version too."
3,Nice Look But Cheap Feel,"I ordered this tie - and another one similar to it - for my husband for Christmas. It arrived promptly in nice packaging, and the tie looks quite nice. Unfortunately, although described as a ""silk"" tie, it's far thicker and rougher than what one would ordinarily expect out of a silk tie. (No doubt that's why it's priced so much less than most 100% silk ties.) Since it's so much more bulky, wearing a double-windsor knot looks ridiculous, and the tie does not fit under some of my husband's button-down collars."
3,average,The von bondies are trying so much to sound like another group *ahem* another few groups out there. I hear talent but..where is it coming from? The desire to immitate other artists or real passion about the music.
4,This IS great,"Its raw and primitive, yet sophisticated at the same time (dont ask me HOW) it is much better than The Strokes debut, but NME are a bunch of blinkered monomaniacs, who seems to love banging on and on about a band just to demonstrate the power of media over the conscience of human thought. The Von Bondies (one member Marcie also moonlights for Slumber Party, a different but equally as fantastic band) are a breath of fresh air, and if anything, break through the haze of the mind in a greater fashion than the White Stripes, who have the rawness with an indie edge, but dont have the CLASS... Just listen to track 7 here and you will know a feeling of warm truth in your stomach, it is something worth listening too..."
2,they're no WHITE STRIPES!,"this band has received a lot of praise mostly on the strength of the fact that they have toured with the very-hyped White Stripes and one of the members of the band is the girlfriend of Jack White of White Stripes. I'll admit that these factors are exactly why I bought this album myself. unfortunately, this is very by-the-numbers garage/blues type stuff. It's not bad, but not great. It reminds me of the Chrome Cranks or the Gimmicks - two ther bands with good taste but were mediocre.buy records from the jon spencer blues explosion, cramps, gories or flat duo jets before turning your attention to this."
4,interesting approach to the subject,"Here we have another very readable book about everyday life in the former historical periods. Book series about the daily life of people in past should be recommended to everyone, who wants to know what history really is and feel it. This well-written book helps the reader in understanding the people from the past better."
3,It could be better,Texts are very interseting and helpful BUT the pictures are very poor quality.If you search for a book with colorful pictures about Egypt forget this book for ever.
4,Ark and Dove Catholic Text,This is a lovely catechism book for my daugther. We will be using over her sophmore and junior years in hs.
5,A superbly written book,"I really enjoyed the book - it was very well written and I liked the balanced approach to aging. My favorite parts were the interviews because aging means so many different things to different people. It was good to know that things like staying curious and being an optimistic person are helpful in aging well and keeping the mind sharp. I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone in their 30s, 40s and 50s who want to make sure they get to their older years in the best shape possible!"
4,Used text to speech to listen to this book,"My kindle has a text to speech function and with the right cables, I was able to listen to the book while driving. There was so much good information in the book, I listened to it twice. Most 'aging right' books ignore spirituality but this book tackled this topic in what I thought was a sensitive way. I thought it was a very well balanced, well written book."
4,Great advice.,"Practical reminders for the growing demographic, me. Nice amount of research behind the insights and recommendations making them very credible.The trick as always is to take this self-help manual and apply."
5,Age Smarrt- Discovering the Fountain of Youth to Midlife and Beyond,"The simple fact of the matter is that we boomers are living younger--longer. In Age-Smart,Discovering the Fountain of Youth to Midlife and Beyond, Jeffrey Rosensweig and Betty Liu look at such issues as finances, health and well being, as well as numerous other issues that affect life expectancy. With an abundance of `sensory' caffeine that rejuvenates the spirit, such noted individuals as Former President Jimmy Carter, his wife Rosalynn, Helen Gurley Brown and myriad host of others, will force readers to re-think how they `see' the elderly. With such fun chapters as Just Say No to Pink Pants, Age Smart is chockfull of easy-to-use tips that supports that old adage,`that age is nothing but a number,' and I was humbled to be asked to be a part of what I predict will be a invaluable resource for men and women of all ages for years to come.Carol Gee, author of The Venus Chronicles and Diary of a `Flygirl' Wannabe"

1,More promotion than instruction,"The first part of this tape was very good -- good demonstrations, clear and understandable. However, the last part was strickly promotional. I feel I got only half a tape. It would have been okay to show a little of her work, but this was too much!I feel cheated. I would not recommend this VHS."
3,"Not bad as a first guitar songbook, but see comments...","I used this songbook to learn guitar and it was pretty good, but these songs sound MUCH better with a capo. Why Hal Leonard doesn't include this info (especially for beginners) is beyond me. I recommend these capo positions with standard tuning: Building a Mystery (2nd fret), Adia (no capo), Angel (1st fret), Hold On (1st fret), I Love You (1st fret), Ice Cream (no capo), Sweet Surrender (2nd fret), Possession (no capo), Witness (2nd fret). Have fun!"
4,Good For Beginners,The songs contained here are keyed down for easier singing and any TABs are simplified. A great books for SM fans just starting out on playing the guitar.
2,Watch out,I bought this thinking it was It Came From Outer Space with Richard Carlson. It is not that movie. It is a lame documentary.
3,"Very interesting theory, but an average book.","The Orion theory is very compelling and explains a lot of mysteries surrounding the Pyramids. But the book never gets really exciting for the ordinary readers, especially those who are not too familiar with egytological terms and history. There are many illustrations which is good, but they are not always placed on the pages where they are referred to in the text and that makes it a little confusing. I think Bauval should have kept the story more strictly chronological, to make it a better research/detective story."
3,Interesting but over-wrought,"The story has some very interesting points, some very well researched. But there are some conclusions made which seem illogical and strain plausibility. There are points made which could have simple explanations that have already been offered, yet the authours try to explain them in a different, more circumstancial way, to fit in with their thesis.There are some very interesting parts and the book contains a large amount of useful information. If you have an open mind (or if you are a conspiracy theorist) there is much too enjoy in this book."
2,Amazingly boring,"Granted, the author got some interesting ideas. But why does he hide them for the most part of the book? About 80% of the book is a repetitive description of different facts, theories and opinions, with the author arguing about ""what is not correct"", and no clue at what is he getting at. Well, not fare, he gives some clues, but not more. Sometimes it looks like he's got carried away with a need to talk (or write) without any point to deliver.Again, that's not to say that he does not have any interesting things inside, he certainly has. It's just those interesting things would fit into 20 pages if described without well-known, repetitive and not-so-exciting things."
3,The importance of having purpose.,What was the purpose behind building the pyramids? I know. Why do archeologists feel compelled to drill thru every door leading to secret rooms within pyramids? I know the purpose behind that as well. More importantly I know that unless you wish to end up like Atlantis and every other ancient civilization that being vanished and vanquished you will remove urselves from all juxtapositions against pyramids. Ur better off rock or mountain climbing. Don't tell me I didn't tell u so! Does the book address these issues?
5,History revised,"This book not only takes apart the basic history of Egypt you learned in school, it introduces the radical concept that the Eygyptians weren't a). stupid, b). primitive, or c). superstitious twits.Bauval shows how the pyramids were arranged so precisely because they were creating a heaven on earth--they reflect the patterns of Orion's belt on the ground. This had deep significance to a race of people who believed ''as above, so below.''The reader who claims that Bauval now refutes his own Orion theory is sadly misinformed. Anyone who is interested can go read Bauval's letter to the BBC at www.grahamhancock.com. Apparently, the ''Horizon'' program, in its zeal to knock both Hancock (not a pseudo-scientist but a talented journalist)badly mis-represented Bauval's theories to the British viewing public.But read it for yourself. I think the sequel, ''The Message of the Sphinx,''is even better."
4,Fascinating.........,"Being a novice on the pyraminds, I found this book absolutely fascinating. To think that all those years ago the people of Egypt could have known that much information about the stars is amazing. We usually think of these people as undeveloped, but if the pyramids are truly as complex as these two think than we are talking a whole different ball game. As a novice, I do have a couple of comments about how the book was written. For the most part it flowed fairly smooth. There were a couple of spots where I felt the authors delved a ""little too deep"" with technical information. But than again, the book was intended to bring attention from the professional fiend about their work, not to be read by a woman engineer who has no experience with the pyramids. One warning, have a lot of time if you are not familiar with the pyramids because it will take you awhile to get thru all the information and make sense of it all."
4,Alternative insight spark new interest in pyramids,"For those who are interested in the pyramids, this book cut across very strong conventional thinking of what they are thought to be and sprout new insights into their purpose. For those who support the underdogs, the story of the obstacles the author faced to bring us this alternative insight is also worth reading about. After first reading this book in 1994, my interest in the pyramids was rekindled and my suspicion of their purpose lifted slightly. My sixth sense have always told me that the pyramids are not just tombs, even for pharaohs. To view them as a stellar temples are more ""acceptable conventionally"". Are we a step closer to finding out the truth about the pyramids? I remember a time what someone suggest that the earth is round when the catholic church believe that it is flat. Perhaps, we are heading in the right direction this time. I first read about the Pyramid Text in this book."
4,The Orion Mystery: Unlocking the Secrets of the Pyramids,"Good, fast read that brings together several hundred years of Egyptology theories into a well researched fresh explanation of the Pyramid Mystery. Good work, Robert. Thank you for following through to complete the project, in spite of the scorn of the ""scholars""."
4,Very good book,"I ma reading up on mysteries of the world and am interested in the Orionbelt and the other stars. I found this book and it is well written and yet very clear and understandable. It also made me want to learn more about other sites and the Maya's. I am still not done with it, but when i am done i will be reading more of the subject."
4,"Turn into a Flash ""Gonna Bee"" instead of a ""Wanna Bee""","Question: Do you want to learn to Flash? This most difficult program requires the precise application to detail Sham provides. For some, the first 75 pages are the toughest to wade through. If your gonna loose it, this is where it's gonna happen. Get to page 75, however, and it's ""bingo"" you are coming up on how to build a Flash Web Site. The timid need not apply. Flash seperates the talented and gifted from the maddening crowd.If you wanna Learn Flash, this book is where it's at. I would give the book 5 stars, but for the first few pages that were distractingly ""wordy"" between key technical points."
5,Excellent Book to Start learning Flash,"This is by far the best book on Flash for people new to the medium. It not only teaches you how to use Flash, but instills some basic design principles. The tutorials are easy to follow and can be easily adapted for your own needs. The whole series of books from Friends of Ed are just great."
4,Before you start -- look at the Errata!,"Wonderful hands-on, get-comfy orientation to the Flash 5 workspace that gives you enough confidence and experience to move on to the really good stuff that Flash 5 can do. **However, if you are a novice you MUST go to the ... ... ... before you even open the book!** Navigate to the section for Foundation Flash 5, and look at the errata. Correct all the (crucial!) mistakes you find there. You won't understand why so much goes wrong in the ongoing case study after Chapter 7 otherwise -- these errors compound themselves pretty quickly. For beginners who are following instructions without understanding the concepts behind them yet, this is incredibly frustrating, and mars an otherwise great introduction to a difficult program."
3,Good for beginners,"I just purchased flash 5 and since the last time I'd used any Macromedia products was Dreamweaver 1.0 I knew that I'd need a good book to quickly get me up to speed. I went to the library and got a copy of this book and was impressed with the structure and information contained in it. I went through the entire book in about two weeks and feel that I now have a good basic grasp on flash. However, it is hard to go back in chapters and review specific subjects or actions. The index is worthless and to try and find a specific topic you must scan the entire chapter. Now that I've read the book I am glad I used it as an introduction, but I think that I'll buy something that expands more on the topics and is a better reference manual."
3,Foundation Flash 5,"This book is helpful. I've had other technology ""how to"" books that were more helpful though. I use the index frequently, and it seemed not to have several topics for which I was searching."
3,Good starting point.,"This book is not a reference to flash 5.This book goes through step by step how to make flash movies from the ground up. It assumes nothing; which is great for most beginners.I was definitly not a beginner when i bought the book. (i got it at the time of release because it was hyped up quite a bit).At the time i understood, and fast tracked through it to get at the good stuff to find out that it never really got any ""great"" stuff. Some of the examples are done very well, and are great in the tutorial sense, but i was disapointed that i didn't learn anything new. (or little).This is flash 5. You could learn flash just as well with tutorials online at any of the bigger flash websites. If you're new to flash: this is a great start. But if you have the least bit of flash knowledge then i can see someone getting bored with this qucikly.Bottom line:Great place to start. Not a reference by any means. Remember its flash 5. Flash MX is out, and much more fun than flash 5."
2,whoops,"I anxiously waited for this book to arrive. Having visited Amada Farr's excellent website, and having used the many tutorials there, I was expecting a blockbuster book. When it came I read it cover to cover. Wow, I was impressed. It sounded great. The explanations seemed really straightforward and surely gave me the feeling that this was the only Flash book I would need. The trouble started when I went back and tried to do the exercises, particularly the case study. I found whole sections missing an explanation. I read and reread sections to see if it was just me. I tried again, and still was not able to get the case study up and running as explained in the book. In desperation, I invited a friend, someone with no flash experience, over to try and see if he could succeed where I had failed. He did not. I am now looking for another Flash 5 book, one that has examples that work."
2,Very shallow introduction,"Actionscript may surprise many a programmers; it is not a shallow programming language and with foundations in ECMAScript and a deep arsenal of tools, it poses a very steep learning curve. What this book attempts to do is sugar-coat by example; you do things - you copy the code, you mess around with it, but after you are done with the book you know you need so much more. Hand holding is nice, but effectiveness is important too. Skip this one."
2,Fair,There is no way this is the only Flash book you need -- it's more a good intro. I used it to transition to Flash 5. Except the Actionscripting chapters are obnoxious and a bit sloppy. I'm waiting for Wrox to put out their version on action scripting because Flash looks like its heading toward programming language land.
5,Foundation Flash 5,"This is by far and away the best book to learn Flash! I have been buying Flash books for the past year and a half and none had the user friendly style and teaching techniques that this incredible tome has! I highly recommend it for beginners in Flash as well as someone that may be a web developer that has been given the task of doing a Flash site and has never done it. This book WILL show you how to do every technique needed to be a Flash developer. I feel greatly indebted to the authors and especially Amanda Farr for giving us her fabulous website, Visual-fx.com Thank you Amanda and keep up the great work! -Rob :)"
1,Sloppy nstructions ruin a potentially good book,"At the start the book seems promising, but as you get into the exersizes there are too many missed steps that left me grinding my teeth in frustration. I knew it wasn't me. Essential steps were missing many times. I am a fairly experienced Flash 4 user,the instructions WERE NOT COMPLETE. When this happens it's hard to tell if you were better off not wasting your time with a book that seems to have some really teriffic information in it because you waste your very valuable time goin thru the forst steps only to find yourself roadblocked down the line by the carelessness of the instructions."
5,Best application book I've used,"If you need or want to learn Flash 5.0, this is the only book you need to consider. Every excercise builds and expands on what you have already completed to make a finished product. You will constantly be thinking of other ways to apply what you are learning. If you've completed the Macromedia tutorial you probably aren't that impressed by Flash 5.0. If you complete Foundation Flash you'll never want to use anything else. I immedeatly purchased Foundation ActionScript. Shams' writing is complete, logical with some sharp wit. Don't bother with the others."
4,So Cute!,This game is sooooo cute. I bought it for my daughter and I and we just loved it. I personally loved the Time Out Cave! This game is adorable.
5,Great turner/spatula,Weighty handle; not flimsy in any way; German engineering :) I can honestly say that this is the best spatula I've ever had.
4,S/S slotted turner,Very impressed as to how quickly I received product. Turner is good but a little heavier than what I thought it would be. I like the length of the turner as well as the slots. It is a good turner and I plan to keep it.
4,Come Clean/Mysteries of Lide,"This CD immediately gets your attention! Their unmistakable melodramatic sound is such a fresh change. The songs are well thought out and nicely done. I especially like ""Your face betrays you"" as it easily relates to everyone that has been there/felt that. Come Clean, the opening and title track is a great opener. This is the type of CD that you would want to put on, open the windows and just take in that lazy sunny weekend. You won't be disappointed."
5,the greatest thing in American music you've never heard of..,"Once in a great while you hear a collection of songs with which you instantly identify. They make your life a little richer; they become the soundtrack to your conscious hours. You play this collection of songs for everyone you love, because you care for them and you want them to know this wonderful secret. ""come clean"" is such a thing. i am concerned that i can't find the superlatives to convey its simple wondrousness. the mysteries of life have given me a gift and i'm damn grateful to them"
5,A Delightful Production,"This ""Mikado"" is a delight. I have seen several DVD versions of this show. This production from the Stratford Festival is by far the best. The costumes are colorful, the makeup is beautifully done, and the choreography is as precise as it is fascinating. The stage that has been designed for this show, which is a marvel to behold, is most appropriate for this Gilbert and Sullivan production. Every performance is a strong one. The beauty of this DVD is in the clearness of sound and picture."
3,"Barebones production, good sound","If you're hooked on G&S and the Mikado, you don't have much of a choice: it's either this or a 1938 production. That one is lush but has poor sound and is missing a key song, ""As someday it may happen, ... I've got a little list"". This one is cute, but the simple background (what background?) takes away tremendously from the overall performance which is pretty good. Poo-Bah is hilarious but miscast, as is Nanki-Poo. And it seems so early 80's, it's hard to forget it, expecially, when the list song mentions the Rubik'c Cube and geriatric statesman Ronnie. Not bad, just not that great. The sound is acceptable, but not great."
2,Affected mannerisms no substitute,"Having purchased this DVD version of The Mikado, based on the reviews given here, I have to write in that I was extremely disappointed. Expecting something along the line of the Kline/Ronstadt/Smith/Rose/Routledge stage performance of Penzance, I found myself instead watching repetitious affectations (Pooh-Bah , Katisha and the Mikado were the worst for this) that gave the impression that what I was really watching was a Shogun parody with singing. Comedic, yes. Funny, yes. Energetic and acrobatic? Mostly the tumblers changing the sets around. The singing was ""stage"" good, though I found it difficult to listen to the voices of Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum - very pretty but little depth. And Nanki-Poo really should have developed at least one aspect to his character other than ""village idiot""."
1,not as advertised,"i informed you that the ""operetta"" could not be viewed on this dvd --- only the ""special features"". you sent me another copy - same problem. i believe that you should inform customers that this dvd only contains ""special features""."
2,A waste of plastic.,"I plan to sell my copy of the DVD to a used record dealer, because I don't have the heart ever to look at it again. In most respects I was very disappointed in this amateurish production. Some of the singing's not bad; none is REALLY bad; that's the best part. I felt the sets and costumes were minimal and ugly--amazing, since G&S costumery is often lavish and splendid. Annoying tricks of acting, a superannuated and unattractive cast, and poor direction make this presentation a waste of money."
1,Ugly people doing G&S on double-speed,"I don't know if they were pressed for time or what, but every number is done at breakneck speed. Gilbert's great libretto and lyrics are all but lost in the auctioneer-style delivery of all but a few songs. The second main criticism is that every member of the cast is, well, unattractive and unpersonable, and in some cases a bit elderly. The pacing, direction and over-the-top characterizations are annoying to the point of ruining the material, for this viewer at any rate.The snippets of scenes in Mike Leigh's _Topsy Turvy_ are worlds above the level of this somewhat amateurish, slapstick, local dinner theatre quality version. If only he had produced a companion version of the entire operetta with the actors and sets he had at his disposal.I suggest this DVD would make an excellent skeet shooting target. It flies amazingly straight and stable with a quick flick of the wrist. Aim quickly and pull. A can't miss hit!"
5,Put it on your Little List,"Despite the simplicity of staging, this has to be one of the most refreshing productions of ""The Mikado"" available. For instance, Koko is not the high-strung clown as is usually played, but is actually the straight man, reacting to the ill-assorted clowns around him, most notably a tall, willowy Pooh-Bah who is most likely gay, a group of amazingly clumsy samurai, three little maids who are quite silly, and a Katisha who looks like a demented Margaret Thatcher. Minor changes in lyrics and dialog can be forgiven because the whole production is so filled with fun and charm that it is impossible not to like it. I haven't been able to watch it enough times. Don't miss it."
3,Not Gilbert & Sullivan,"I find the added laugh-track annoying. But, even more so, I find that the music director has re-orchestrated the entire score of ""Mikado"" for Xylophone! Brian Macdonald is a great choreographer. But, he has insisted on directing Gilbert & Sullivan operettas as though they were ballets! The sets, costumes, and choreography are great. But, I think the choreography is so complicated and constant that it is distracting to the art that Gilbert & Sullivan created. Richard McMillan is an awful Pooh-Bah! He and the director have absolutely no idea what Gilbert & Sullivan operas are about. McMillan (as Don Alhambra) ruined the Stratford ""Gondoliers"" in the same way he ruined this ""Mikado."" And the character of the Mikado is acted as though Japan was ruled by a lunatic. Both Gilbert & Sullivan would have hated what Stratford has done with this ""Mikado."""
5,Excellent Stratford Production!,"I have never seen the Mikado performed before and after seeing this version any other would be disapointing. I enjoyed all the principal players, especially Richard McMillan ,Eric Donkin, Henry Ingram and Allan Stewart-Coates. Pooh-Bah was hilarious and Marie Baron's singing was excellent. I share it with my friends and watch it many, many times. I loved it!"
4,As you like it !,Not for the critical puritan! But for the rest of us this is a brilliant performance.The stage sets are simple yet effective and do not detract from the performers. The scene changes are done with acrobatic sublety and humour.This is a performance where all the cast are enjoying what they are doing and it shows. Gideon Saks as the Mikado is exceptional and special praise must go to Richard McMillan ( Pooh Bah ) for an inspired and captivating performance ( I think he actually steals the show ).This is a video that can be viewed time and time again. You will see something new each time. Two thumbs up on this one.
1,Stratford Presents G&S Mikado:,"This DVD of Gilbert & Sullivan's operetta ""The Mikado"" was recorded in 1993 at a live performance at Canada's Stratford Festival. The operetta itself is outstanding. The singing, dancing and acting are all good. The staging is imaginative.To this reviewer though, the spoofs of 20th-century Canadian officials, inserted into the dialog, seem as dated as those of their 19th century English counterparts that were in the G&S; original book.Audio quality is OK, but is not up to the best DVD standards. And I really missed the Mikado's aria ""See How the Fates Their Gifts Allot"". Next time, include this and leave out the encores of other songs!"
2,not for pans..,"Even though the buying info states ""great for non-stick pans"", right on the whisk it says ""not for use on pans"". It looks great, but don't expect to use it for much."
2,One of the worst Mandie books ever!!!!,I hated this book. Throughout the entire book I was thinking how childish Mandie was to drag Celia into a dangerous alley and risked getting hurt or even kidnapped! I mean Mandie really needs to grow up!!!!!!!!! She is 13 or 14 years old and she still acts like a baby. That is pretty sad. I would still recommend this book to you because everyone has a different oppinion!
1,Skip It,I was not impressed with this book once we started to use it. Did not give enough directions and what it did tell you was of no value to me. Very confusing. I ended up ordering a different Algebra I book from another company and have been very happy I did!
4,works well,havnt gotten to test it on battery yet but both powered and regular outlets work fine. only bad part is that turning off the ups doesnt turn off power to the surge only side of outlets.
1,They WILL NOT pay you for equipment damaged! Warranteeless!,"Just know going in - if your equipment gets fried, they won't pay you a dime. They will blame it on anything from faulty building wiring to bad grounding and deny your claim. Why don't they just print '$500,000,000,000 WARRANTY' on the box - if they don't intend to stand behind their product? I had one computer system that was wireless and it's only link to electricity was through an APC battery. Lightning struck and it died and started to smell burnt. I sent in the claim and the unit & got what looks like their standard protocol - sorry, no replacement. The system was only worth $200 which is far less than our company spends annually on batteries. I won't use APC again."
5,Great Product,"As good as it gets. Instructions are very clear, even for a 70 year old.Packing could have been a little better but had no problems. Feel much better now that I have this."
5,Great investment to protect expensive electronics,"All my computer equipment in my house is connected to APC Back-UPS units. We get a lot of electrical storms and brownouts in Houston, and my main computer is always on, since i use it as a DVR to record all my TV shows. The battery backup engages daily to protect against brownouts. No doubt, this has preserved my hard disks many times.I've used other brands, and settled on APC -- every company I've been with has used APC for their computers, too.It's a cheap investment to protect sensitive electronics."
5,Great APC Product,"I've had the 500VA version powering my NAS and related peripherals for about a year and the thing just works as is typical with most APC products. I recently put together a desktop computer and am using the BE750BB with it. The most important aspect to me is that it notifies the computer and the NAS of power loss so the devices can gracefully shut down without risking data loss.I prefer this particular product line because the products are relatively small, all the power outlets are on top of the unit so it is more convenient, the outlets are in two distinct banks (one bank for battery backup, one bank for surge protection), and it has ample outlets to obviate the need for a separate power strip."
3,"It's okay, but not exactly as advertised.","The packaging of this product advertises that the on/off switch ""controls power to ALL equipment connected to the outlets"" (emphasis mine). However it doesn't, because it only controls power to the four outlets that are protected by battery backup. The other four outlets have power all the time. This behavior is pretty useless, if you have equipment that doesn't need battery backup (e.g. a printer), but you want to turn power on and off to ALL equipment with a single switch.Other than this, the unit appears to work okay. When you first get it, you have to connect the battery and in order to have the full battery protection time, the unit needs to charge for about 16 hours."
2,The anti- Israeli Israeli,"Tom Segev has made a great reputation for himself among enemies of Israel. He uses his considerable writing skills to undermine the Jewish character of Israel, and to argue against the ideology at the heart of the founding and very existence of the state."
2,Not as originally pictured,"I've used this product for years, but recently not able to find in stores. The name and all info on the container are same as what I had been using, but the coloring of the container is different. The product I normally use IS SHEER, as advertised. This spray is sticky and makes my hair stiff.....NOT what I wanted."
3,"Good for a skimmer, not good as a stirrer","WAAAAY too handle-heavy to use as a stirring spoon. You can't put it down anywhere without it teetering backward and falling to the floor throwing your reduction sauce around the kitchen and on your pants. Very nice spoon for skimming (nylon spoon cup is very thin yet quite rigid), but if you're looking for an all purpose spoon, forget this one."
5,The Apocalypse Agenda,"Wow! Great story, great characters and real situations that could happen tomorrow. I heard the author on a local radio show discuss this book, it sounded good so I got a copy. It read like I was playing a movie in my head. This guy really writes with his eye on the ball. Details, but not too much. Action, but plenty of plausible story to back it up. I really liked it and I heard him say the sequel is coming early next year. Can't wait. It's a real winner. Ya gotta get this book."
2,Clunky clunky,"This is my first Patterson novel, and can say it will be my last. Detective work is practically non-existent in this book, except for the last couple of chapters, wherein the reader is socked between the eyes with all the details of solving the crime. Even the patches of investigative work we see on Alex Cross' part are ridiculously unbelievable. I mean, here we have an FBI agent who resorts to newspaper clippings to figure out if the woman who has been arrested has committed another crime elsewhere in the country, only to figure out that she murdered her 3 children for which she was prosecuted and convicted in Vermont in 1983. I guess fingerprint files weren't on record waaaaay back in the 80's. How insulting Mr. Patterson is to his readers. And that is but example."
5,Time to put Alex to bed?,"While reading this book, I began to get the impression that Mr. Patterson might be considering ending the Alex Cross series. I enjoyed this book, but I really think the series has run it's course. Maybe one more to tie things up. Still, this book should not be missed. It is a quick read, as usual. Great beach book."
4,James is finally writing his own books again!,"Yay! I really enjoyed this one, after the last 5 or so that really left me wanting - yeah, wanting a refund. I think James was really working on this one, all by himself and on his own timeline. You can tell by the chapters that are longer than a page and 1/2. You can tell by various and intriguing threads running through the main storyline (Jamilla, little Alex, and even Sampson got more than a sentence this time!).I will be happy to have less than 6 books a year churned out to meet some obligation. Just write! On your time!! It works!! Thank you thank you for a good Alex Cross novel. We knew you had it in you."
2,Weaker and Weaker,"Maybe I am a little harsh as I may be a little tired of Patterson's books but I didnt think this one was very good. I am not seeing any good details of how the killer is caught nor is the killer very interesting. The letters written to the gossip columnist were't very intriguing and they gave me the sense Patterson was just ""slapping"" this book together. The purpose of the letters should have been something more intriguing or played a better part but they didn't. I also saw what I thought to be a large flaw with the crime detection. There's mention of the same, unique gun and crime done in NY much earlier but no cross check was ever done. It seemed to me that a good detective, would have checked out the rare gun, similar crimes on 2 coasts, cross referenced with times and plane tickets to narrow down suspects."
4,Amazing Twists!,"This was a wonderful mind bending story full of emotional highs & lows. Patterson has created another fascinating and thrilling book and I would recommend it to everyone. I wish they would make more of the Alex Cross series into movies. S.L. Chessor author of Poodlums, Boogeymen and Booglers and My Tongue Fell Out. Poodlums, Boogeymen and Booglers: A Poetry CollectionMy Tongue Fell Out"
2,Boring,"The only reason I finished reading this book was because I had paid for it with hard earned money. For me, way too little suspense and way too much Alex Cross personal problems. The plot seemed contrived and the murderer came out of left field, at least in my opinion. I'm getting tired of Alex Cross's whining about the future of his illegitimate son, little Alex. What did he expect when he got his ex-girlfriend pregnant? Should have known there would be problems in the future. I think I'm finished with Alex Cross. He's starting to annoy me."
2,Big Disappointment,What happened with this author! Plot lacked 'suspense' or depth. Motives of killer and alibi not very plausible and adequately explained. Entertaining but i expected more for $25 audio book.
3,"Enjoyed it, but wish it had been longer","My daughter and I are big Alex Cross fans. I buy the book, read it, and then mail it to her. She will enjoy this one. My only comment is that while it is an improvement on some of the other books in the series, it needed to be longer. I read it in one sitting.Mary, Mary has a lot of the flavor of the earlier Cross novels. It has an interesting story line, but I would like to see added depth to the the characters and to the mystery.While Cross's love life does seem to detract from the main story line, a new character, a young FBI agent, adds to the humor.Don't get me wrong. If you enjoy the Cross series, buy this book. Reading Mary, Mary was like putting on comfortable slippers. Grab a glass of wine or a pot of tea and settle in for a good read."
2,A decent mystery but unnecessarily gory,"The characters were fairly well defined but I didn't much care what happened to them. It seemed the author was constantly trying to shock with violence, blood, and gore but those descriptions didn't enhance or support the plot or the story. If you can overlook the ridiculous amount of painstakingly detailed carnage, I think you'll find it a decent read but I wouldn't pay full boat for it if I had it to do over."
3,Love me some Alex Cross,"This was definitely the JP I know and love. I had been reading through the series and was worried only the first three were good, but I loved the twists and suspense and celebrity-elements of this book. Go for it and read this!"
4,Mary Mary,Holidays are about the only time I get to read and I decided to re-read this one. It's one of my favorite Alex Cross novels and I think one of Patterson's best.
5,Return of An Old Favorite,"Mary, Mary marks a much needed return for popular hero Alex Cross. While Patterson's name has popped up on other book, none in my opinion, match the page turning excellence he provides in the Alex Cross novels. Here all the elements are present, a disturbing killer, Cross' conflict between family and work, and his troublesome love life. Its the interplay between these elements that make Alex Cross Patterson's best creation. Patterson's short chapters and complex, but no too complex plot make this the perfect reading for those us trying to unwind from real world concerns. If your a fan of crime, action, and satisfying conclusion this is the book for you."
4,What's the difference between Alex and Lindsey???,"...That one's a man and the other one's a woman. Oh, and they live far apart from each other, other than that, everything is pretty much the same.Patterson does good in building the action and the mystery. I have to admit, though, I figured out what the A's and B on the stickers were early in the story.The twist is great, but it wraps up too quickly, and I guess they always do.As I was reading this, though, I attempted to picture Lindsey, from the Women's Murder Club series, and had no problem in doing so. We know this is an Alex Cross novel because JP says so. This story reminded me of 1st to Die (an excellent read).In summary, this story is good. It's Patterson returning to his roots, but I think it's getting unwillingly intertwined with the 1st to Die series."
4,Mary Mary,It was a little predictable at times but easier to follow and distinguish the characters than London Bridge. I still enjoyed it as I have the others in this series.
1,1 Star being the lowest - - then deduct TWO more stars!,"I really, REALLY mean it this time - - NO MORE PATTERSON BOOKS FOR ME!!! This was the sorriest excuse yet! His publishing company must have paid some of the critics well - I finally gave in and bought this after hearing one of them state -- ""the scariest Alex Cross novel yet!!!"" Yeah, right!!! The scariest part was the child-custody hearing - I'm sitting there reading chapter after chapter about his child-custody fight??? WTF???Speaking of Chapters - chapter breaks appeared every-other page!!! In the middle of a thought!!! Patterson must've gotten paid by the page rather than by the word!The ending was far-fetched and nowhere close to believable. So he got the idea from an inmate of a psychiatric hospital??? So what made him so DRIVEN to continue killing??? Please!My 8-year-old granddaughter could've done a better job!Shame on you, James Patterson!!!"
4,"Good, but Patterson could be better","I have read every one of Patterson's books. This was good, but I want to see more content and depth in his future books. Story was good, I would have liked to see more character development, but would still recommend."
5,Can't Get Enough of Alex Cross,"I read everything James Patterson writes and unfortunately over the years there have been a few clunkers. But not many. The Alex Cross series never disappoints. In Mary, Mary, Patterson takes the reader on a roller coaster ride when Alex Cross, Nana and the children are enjoying a family vacation in Disney Land. While vacationing, Alex is called upon by the FBI to investigate the brutal murder of a famous actress. The killer is targeting Hollywood movers and shakers and tinsel town is in a tizzy. Who will be next?Mary, Mary is even better than London Bridges. I highly recommend this novel."
1,terrible....,"I have read Patterson from the beginning of his career, and he's rapidly losing steam, and this reader's attention.He's over-prolific, trying to be too hip.. his writing in this book got on my nerves, he's trying too hard, using too many current buzzwords in an attempt to be Cool and Cutting-edge.I will give his next book a go, and if that turns out to be anything like his last few, then it's Adios to Mr. Patterson for me."
1,How did this guy get a book contract?,"I believe I might have read a James Patterson novel years ago, but I must have blocked out how bad it was out of self-protection. Well, I just checked out Mary Mary from the library and am appalled by how sub-par the writing is. And don't even get me started on the short chapters. Does Patterson have any attention span at all? I am no longer surprised by how he manages to crank out so many novels. Just limit the length of your sentences to no more than ten words and use as many cliches as possible, and viola!I managed to get only 40 pages into the book. After two murders and one painfully bad love scene, I just cannot continue. To quote Cross himself (at Chapter 11, the point at which I threw the book across the room), ""This sucked in a way that broke new territory."""
3,Good then not so good,"I thought the ending was ridiculous. It didn't tie any characters together, it gave no REAL reasoning behind the killer AT ALL and it was very ""all over the place"" at the end. It's almost like James Patterson was told YOU HAVE ONE DAY LEFT TO FINISH THIS and he just wrote whatever he could to get it done. The rest of the book was awesome. A for the first 100 chapters, F for the rest."
2,weird enough,"i never understood why i could never finish any book written by this patterson guy, and could never comprehend why he could survive so long as a popular novelist. all of his stuff looked so formulaic and stereotyped, absolutely lack of enthusiasm and sincerity as a thriller writer should be. again, i've tried to reread and restart this one several times, but could never finish it. it read so phony, so insincere with cardboard one dimensional characters and dialogs. as to plot and scenario, well, everything just like a bad b movie and should go directly to dvd release and bury itself in walmart's cheap dvd piles."
3,Seems as if Patterson is losing his steam............,The book seemed rushed to me. The ending just didn't seem to come together very well.
5,If you ever wanted to be a G Man,Ever day dream that you are a G Man out there trying to save the world? Wanta feel like it? Get this book!
5,Mary Mary,"Bad Boy Alex Cross is back, the Cross we all learned to love.This book is absolutely awesome!A must read. I will not tell you about the book because I will spoil it."
4,The story keps moving forward with some believable red herrings!,I liked that the story kept my interest throughout and the Alex Cross character is believable. It is a light holiday read with an unfolding plot marred only buy the continual referencing to the hero's putting of his 'work' in front of his family and the angst that causes him.Anyone that enjoys a crime thriller with well developed characters and wants to be entertained for several hours should find it satisfying.
4,"I'm back, Mr. Patterson","After a few disappointments with the latest Patterson books, I was going to just stop reading this author....Then....I remembered some of his ""first"" writings when I thoroughly enjoyed his books, so I ordered Mary Mary (this is one that I missed).....WOW, Mary Mary is one of his best...keeps you guessing with every page and the ending is definitely a surprise..I am asking myself however, if these Cross books should be read in sequence....because in Mary Mary, one of the characters is Jeanne Galleta, a big star in the LAPD and a love interest of Cross....just started Roses are Red and the first few pages tell us Jeanne Galleta is a teller at a bank that is being robbed.....just curious about this one....anyone know?"
3,Worth The Read,"I've read many of James Patterson books. This was not my favorite, but it was engaging enough to keep you reading."
3,Easy To Listen To,The actors are great which has a significant effect upon the entertainment level of the story. This is a typical Patterson book- short chapters and a surprize villian (you won't be able to guess who it is because Patterson never leaves any clues). I still liked it. The story moves fast. A Patterson audio book is always good to listen to while cleaning the house.
5,absolutely stuppendous,Once Again James Patterson kept me on my seat full of suspension.I love the way he pulls you into the story and makes you feel like your part of the developing story.I coundn't put it down until I was done...............thank you James Patterson for a weekend of thrills.
1,1/3 blank paper,Regardless of the story(s) this will be the last book of his I will purchase. Every 2nd or 3rd page is a new chapter resulting in 1/3 of the book being blank paper. I find this a cheesy ploy to add physical bulk to what is in reality a small novel. Since he continues to want to publish books like this I will spend my money on other novels that don't try to make their book into more than it is.
2,disappointed,My goodness what a rip off - the entire novel could have been printed on the back of a cereal box!It is very hard to stay interested with all of the starts and stops caused by Mr. Patterson's one page chapters. Hack!I couldn't even unload it at a garage sale!
5,Finally Alex Cross is Back,"Finally Alex Cross is back. After Four Blind Mice things just went down hill and London Bridges was just horrible! But now Paterson takes Alex Cross back to his old ways. This is the best Alex Cross book while he has been in the FBI.The plot is good which was what Four Blind Mice, Big Bad Wolf, and London Bridges missed. And it has Alex Cross's personal life which was what London Bridges was missing; his family and friends are part of the reason why I love this series so much. Damien is now a teenager; Nana Mama is getting older, and every time the baby Alex debate comes up I feel so sad. Things are getting really mucky for Alex Cross alright.I had thought I guessed who the murderer was, but of course James Patterson pulled the rug out under my feet again. While this not one of the best in the series it is still very good. Alex Cross is back in top form and I cannot wait until the next installment comes around in November."
3,"Quick and fast paced, but not Patterson's best","I love the short chapter, racing to the finish style of Patterson's, but am usually finding myself thinking that I should have waited until I found the book at the library instead of buying. The early Alex Cross novels are just SO much better. I am still interested in the story of his life, and family, and I was more interested in this case than that of the ""wolf"" books, but have too many questions after closing the book that weren't answered. All in all, it was ok."
1,UGH,Alex is in a bad mood and all goes wrong. The story is not up to the standard. I wonder if Patterson read it?
3,"Same Old, Same Old.","Standard formula for Patterson. Alex Cross, his granny who never grows older, his kids, the custody battle, the girlfriend in San Francisco who meets him for one night stands, etc., etc.The length of each book is even the same. The only different element in his books is the villain. This is my last Patterson book."
2,"Mary, Mary","Oh, Dr. Cross, get over yourself. The women in this guy's life either take care of him, throw themselves at him or are mentally ill.The chapters were too short. Mr. Patterson's portrayal of women is one-dimensinal. It did keep me interested enough to read it in almost one sitting, just to see if it would get any better. Being a top seller, I thought I must be missing something. I have to admit the premise of the Storyteller was interesting, but how about actually developing the villian's character without just throwing him at us at the end?Try again, Mr. Patterson."
3,"Mary, Mary (paperback version)","Mary, Mary (the paperback version), is interesting in a number of ways.1. It is .7 inches taller than the conventional paperback, but the same width. Thus, it sticks up when shelved along other ""mass paperbacks.""2. It cost $9.99! Isn't this a new high for a paperback? Is this because of the special printing?3. Alex Cross still has difficulties with his various relationships.Mary, Mary is an okay mystery story. I really wanted to know ""who done it."" Unfortunately, the ""done it"" guy is pretty lame. His motivation is weak, his ability to out-think everybody is unrealistic, and the woman eventually arrested for the various murders is never fully absolved. Why was her hair at the crime scene (intentionally or unintentionally planted)? What was the rationale for the killer to use the same type of gun Mary had?Wanted to know how it ends, but the plot still had irritating holes in it. A three-star book for sure."
3,Same old same old,"Entertaining but not spectacular like early Patterson Cross novels. The padding is becoming more and more obvious - short one or two page chapters, wide margins and large print -to make the book seem bigger physically. A 400 page novel that is really 175 with normal techniques in publishing. If you can read it in three hours is really a novel, or a novella.Even the writing though, competent seems tired and routine. I keep waiting for more philisophical observations, observations on life, family, work, crime - all the things that made me a Patterson fan in the first place. Maybe it is just me, but JP seems bored, and that could be fatal. I hope the next time out he takes his work out to the edge and really pushes like his old works, like ""Kiss the Girls"". Maybe he's under pressure to turn out too many titles in too short a time, using co-authors to get it done - or worse of all, I hope it's not more about the money than the art."
1,Enjoyable but not worthy of an Alex Cross story,"I read the first four Alex Cross books in 2 weeks, shared with my father who also loved them, not only were you on the edge of your seat unable to put the book down, reading well into the night to the annoyance of my husband, but you could also smell the coffee in Nana Mama's kitchen. I hate to be disloyal to someome who has given me so much pleasure in his books but they are becoming far to brief and whilst the story is still there the story telling no longer is."
4,Moms beware,"A female serial killer? Could it really be? Alex Cross, FBI Agent investigates a serial killer in the heart of Hollywood. This time the killer is targeting mothers who know how, but aren't keeping a perfect family.I really liked this one. I haven't read a lot of Cross novels but I am wanting to go back and read the ones I've missed. I read Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider, but then I fell off the bandwagon of Patterson fans. I didn't want it to be a let down when one of the novels didn't live up to the first two. But I recently read Violets are Blue and now Mary Mary and realized that I've been missing something good. I think I will definitely go back and read all that I've missed!"
3,It's Time for Alex Cross To Retire,"I enjoyed this book much more than London Bridges, it had the fast paced, edge of your seat thrills of most of the past Alex Cross novels, but it's just getting to be too predictable reading about Alex Cross chasing and catching the villians, and his life with the kids and Nana Mama. I've read all of James Patterson's books, and got hooked a long time ago with the early Alex Cross books and couldn't wait for the next one to be published. I've also enjoyed the stand alone stories like Hide & Seeek and Cradle & All, that have come in between the Cross novels. It's just starting to feel like Alex Cross is getting a bit repetative and a bit boring. Sometimes it almost feels as if they are being written with a screenplay in mind. I think a whole new storyline might add some pizazz to the James Patterson line. I'm ready for some new blood and new characters!!"
4,"Fast, easy read","Perfect for a day of reading snuck in between dishes, laundry and chores. Easy to skim but with enough emotion to feel meaningful"
5,Oh... Mary,This is one of Patterson's best books. Some twists in the plot are unexpected. The plot held my attention and curiosity from beginning to end.
3,Not his best,"First of all - I LOVE James Patterson. I love the pace of his novels - the twists and turns - and the fact that his writing style clear and direct. But, I did not LOVE this one. It seemed disjointed and convuluted - like he was juggling too many balls at one time. The surprise ending was good - but by that time, I felt like I had worked a little too hard to follow the story."
3,easy read; surprise ending,"This is an average James Patterson book -- better than some, not as good as others. I read it on a 4 1/2 hour flight and it was an easy read.If you like plot twists and a multiple surprise ending, you will enjoy it very much. If you like detailed clues so you can figure out who done it as you read through the book, this one will leave you frustrated.The sub-plot involving lead investigator Alex Cross' custody battle with his ex-wife is interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying.Buy it used and enjoy a good quick read."
3,Not bad... actually good enough,"1. I'm the least capable to review Patterson's books in that this is the first one I've read. With that being said, I wasn't expecting much, but overall--> it was entertaining / engaging. Overall, it was definitely good enough for me to read another Patterson book."
3,hollywood thriller is solid,Mary Mary the 11th Alex Cross novel is solid and better than some and is helped by the change of scenery from DCto Los Angeles. The murderer is not thta compelling but some new characters for Cross to interact with and some of Pattersons better writing stylistically makes this a solid effort
2,By far not the best Alex Cross Novel,"I was a little disappointed when i closed the last page on this book. The story just was not like what I'm used to reading from Patterson. There was not a lot of mystery in the book, I was pretty sure who 'did it'. In fact the last few Alex Cross novels I have read were disappointing, I fear that Patterson is losing his touch."
5,Hot chocolate perfection,"I love cooking hot chocolate and chai on the stove top, even when I'm the only taker, and this little whisk is perfect for such occasions."
5,Best mini wisk,"Very pleased. Product exceeded my expectations. I've used flimsier mini wisks in the past and they rust, bend, etc. This one is so durable and a pleasure to use."
2,whisk that does not measure up,The whisk was describes as an 8 inch whisk but it is not. It looked smaller so I measures it and it turned out to only be 6 3/4 inches with a 1/2 inch hanger on the end of handle. The actual whisk part is not tall enough (only 3 inches). I was looking for something taller as one would expect for an 8 inch whisk. Disappointed customer
3,so so,"It's a so-so product. Nothing really too special about this. Not sure I'd buy one for a friend because the head is really small - only about 1 inch long, and it doesn't seem to aerate batter as well as a more traditional small whisk would with more metal tines per inch."
4,truly a companion,"great information for aspiring players of Beethoven's sonatas. It is not a substitute for the Tovey addition of the sonatas though, but rather a complimentary document. Together they are a powerful tool for understanding the sonatas and how to play them."
5,Anuna's enchanting harmonies bring constant enjoyment!,"I recommend this album as the starter for anyone's budding Anuna collection. Although I have enjoyed other Anuna CDs, this one is unique in that I find its music exactly as enthralling as it was the day I bought it. Director Michael McGlynn's original songs and traditional arrangements are nothing short of amazing. I've never seen a choral group of Anuna's kind, and I don't think any group can equal their talent. If you want to see new life breathed into ancient Latin chants and Irish traditional songs, try this (and all the others)!"
4,Interesante manera de ver la vida con libertad,"El autor sabe cómo explicar muy claramente el objetivo , de la vida, de las cosas, de las personas que nos rodean. Nos da una cierta visión de como tomar las cosas, buenas o malas y poder darle un sentido mejor y más valorado. Aunque algunas veces un poco repetitivo, la guia es una buena opción para tomar algunas decisiones en tu vida, lo recomiendo ampliamente."
5,Los Cuatro Acuerdos,"Los cuatro acuerdos: Una guia practica para la libertad personal (Four Agreements, Spanish-language edition)Un libro que nos traspasa sabidurías antiguas para ser felices. Inspira a que seamos mejores seres humanos."
4,Sabiduria en el diario vivir,"Este libro es pequeño pero lleva mucha sabiduria en sus palabras. Los cuatro acuerdos son principios fundamentales del diario vivir. Para aquellas personas que viven bajo uno o algunos de estos principios, este libro no hace sino confirmar cuan importante es aplicarlos en nuestra vida. Para las personas que no aplican estos principios, este libro es una puerta hacia una nueva dimensión que nos permite vivir a plenitud y alcanzar la alegria día a día."
4,Buen contenido pero...,No le doy cinco estrellas por que en ocasiones me pareció un poco lento ... aunque definitivamente vale la pena escucharlo.
5,"Good conditions, sold as it was advertise.","Good conditions, sold as it was advertise. The book is one of the best of Don Ruiz!Fast delivery, great service. No hassle"
3,Hermoso libro aunque repite mucho,"Un libro que te entrega un hermoso mensaje aunque repite lo mismo de diferentes formas. Basicamente te ensena a que tenemos que aprender a vivir sin hacerle danio a la gente, sin juzgarlos, no tomandonos las cosas personalmente y haciendo lo mejor y lo que mas se puede todos los dias.Un libro interesante, pero que me dejo con gusto a poco."
2,LOS CUATRO ACUERDOS: UNA GUIA PRACTICA PARA LA LIBERTAD PERSONAL,A MI NO ME LLENO SORRY ESPERABA MAS DEL LIBRO PERO EN UN LIBRO QUE NOS RECUERDA LO QUE NUNCA DEBERIAMOS OLVIDAR AMARNOS CADA DIA MAS
5,"vale la pena leer, re-leer y volverlo a leer","es una guia espiritual al maximo potencial, nos va llevando de la mano con una facilidad hacia una vida plena, tanto para nosotros como para las personas que tenemos alrededor.pero creo que se si lo tenemos que leer mas de una vez, ya que estasmos programados con una serie de vicios que nos hace involuntariamente hacer y hacernos daño"
5,Une buena guia de vida,"Una buena guia de vida, los cuatro acuerdos son una enseñanza de vida. Un libro que te tomara menos de 1 semana para leerlo y una vida para aplicarlo"
4,Elevacion del ser,"El primer libro de Don Miguel Ruiz que lei, fue parte de mi entrenamiento como ""LIFE COACH"" y se llama la Maestria del Amor. Ese libro me dejo tantas ensenanzas y conceptos importantes de vida para meditar que decidi comprar LOS CUATRO ACUERDOS.LOS CUATRO ACUERDOS son la consecusion de la MAESTRIA DEL AMOR. El libro nos muestra de forma practica cuatro importantes acuerdos que debemos tener siempre presente en la forma de enfocar nuestra vida. Son claves para el exito y la abundancia holisticamente hablando, pues si asi los ponemos en practica, seremos infinitamente mas felices y mas completos como seres humanos."
4,Excelente,"It's a great book, if you have no read it yet. Do not hesitate. I have studied many different spiritual paths. This is a very practical way to live it."
2,Great idea & start to a fillm...,& then all downhill. At one point it turned into the Blair Witch Project (as another reviewer mentioned)& then a dopey horror movie. The ending was very stupid. It made no sense. Could have been good.
2,Drama to After School Special to Bad B-Horror,"What begins as a decent atmospheric, suspenseful thriller, dives deeply into After School Special territory, and (without giving away the ending) ends in the last frames with worst kind of cheap, C-horror twist.The story was good and fairly believable. The acting, for most of the cast, was very good. The suspense quotient was decent. There were some incongruities with Santi's character, and this troubling inconsistency was maddening and really broke the suspense of disbelief.Had the director stuck with one vision, preferably the closer-to-reality, non-supernatural story, this would have been a decent flick. Instead it seemed to bounce back and forth, and with that ending, he seemed to just throw in the towel."
3,"Well written, compelling, and depressing as hell",Orsinian tales is very well written with Leguin's usual economy and grace. But it's frequently depressing. So take in small doses.
3,Too many tracks!,"Yes, very beautiful music, as we expect from Eno: particularly the first five tracks. But that's just the problem - you can't chop music like this into bite-sized tracks. It ends up sounding like a sort of sampler. Mainly for this reason (though also because I'm not so wild about the rather tongue-in-cheek ""space cowboy"" tracks that come after Endless Ascent), I personally don't rate this as highly as some of Eno's other works, such as Music for Airports: although in my opinion it certainly could be as good or better, if Eno would only recycle the existing material to create a seamless 70-minute whole."
3,pretty good new age,"This is pretty cool spacey stuff. Reminds a lot of Enja and Kitaro, in that mellow soothing way. Good stuff for lying in a warm bath with or dusting around the house."
3,I like it but it's rather moody,"This is my first Brian Eno purchase, so let that be known. I am new to his ambient style.I liked the reviews I read about it, and thought the samples were cool. That being said, it is not something to listen to when I'm driving around, or am wide awake. It is rather eiry for the most part.I don't want to give this a bad review, because sometimes it's a really great sound. I just really have to be in the right mood for it.Try it out for yourself."
4,Fantastic ambient album,"As far as this type of music goes, I think this is one of the best albums in this style. Every piece of music here is a gem. If you like music to relax to or just listen to, this is a good choice. I would say if you close your eyes, put on headphones and just listen, it feels like you are floating through a big cloud."
4,Excellent!!,"This CD is great - it makes you feel like you're floating in space, which is just what it set out to do. Don't pass this one over because you think it's just ""muzak"" - it's so much more imaginative than background music, although it certainly works as that. The whole CD's great, but I have to mention two tracks in particular. ""An Ending (Ascent)"" is one of the loveliest pieces of music I've ever heard - it's that good. And for sheer dreaminess, you can't beat ""Deep Blue Day"" - too bad most people associate that one with the ""swimming for suppositories"" scene in the movie ""Trainspotting"". Do yourself a favor if you like soft music - get yourself this CD!"
5,Possibly Eno's best ambient work to date.,This is a great album! A must buy! I love track four!!!! Maybe on land is just as good. Oh I don't know. Eno is just essential all around.
4,One of Eno's best works,"This is actually the soundtrack for a film about the Apollo missions called ""For All Mankind."" It exemplifies Eno's ability to filter and fog musical elements and to weave them into an ethereal fabric. ""Ascent"" is gorgeous, and a couple of tracks show some surprisingly good guitar work as well.My only complaints:1)some tracks should have and could have lasted much longer.2)what's the deal with the track that sounds like ""little drummer boy?"" A couple of tracks on Apollo are a little too muzak for my taste.You really need to see ""For All Mankind"" to appreciate how well this music integrates with the footage of the moon missions. Unbelievable. Definitely worth the nominal price of admission."
5,Amazing Record!,I ordered this online a few weeks ago and I'm thankful I did! It got to my house quickly in great shape and the record was in very good shape. It had no major problems with wear and tear or background hissing. It was definitely worth the money!
5,Ambient masterpiece is a must have for any collection.,"I used to love falling asleep to this album. Brian Eno's swirling, evolving musical textures are very conducive to relaxation. Brian is assisted by his brother Roger, and by superstar producer Daniel Lanois.Don't wait. GET THIS CD."
4,Celestial Heaven,I really enjoy New Age music that is celestial. This is one of my favorites. Anyone who enjoys music that will take your mind for a trip through the stars will enjoy this CD.
5,"An ""ascent""... to heaven","How come five stars to one of the least enchanting of ambient records by Brian Eno? Simple: for 'An ending (ascent)' (track no.5, 4'18'') is worth all the disk. And many others still to come. A masterwork that has the only flaw to be too (too!!) short! Play it looped at least twelve times and it will make you forget your weight!(why did I say one of the least enchanting? Well, it comes without saying that ""every man to his taste""; moreover I prefer the wide, open, desert landscapes of the ""ambient"" series to the maybe too short expressions of Apollo...)"
1,Don't Waste Your Time - It's a Zero,"If you are looking for a novel about the American Revolution or 18th century America - go elsewhere. You get no sense of the times. What you get is a sappy romance between too-good-to-be-true characters and - oh yeah - uh, there's some kind of war going on about something.This book is NOT a historical novel. It is a romance novel with religious overtones (not that there's anything wrong with romance and religion). But everything is so superficial, why would anybody care about this shallow story or these cardboard charaters?"
3,book review,I found this book an excellent resource for information but not for maths exercises needed for a Grade three class that I thought ELEMENTARY meant!!
1,"Required, but poor quality","This text may have been required by the course I took, but it is a low quality test written in the obscure, academic way that gives textbooks bad name. It takes an interesting subject and makes it boring."
4,Thanks,"Not exactly sure what you want me to say! However, besides some major highlighting in chapter one I think that the book is in great condition. Considering that college books are very expensive and I have cut into half of my cost with this purchase I would really like to thank this seller."
3,Not as good as I expected,"The books condition was bad, much worse then described. I also payed for express shipping and it took awhile to get to me."
2,So poorly written it is painful.,"Although there seems to be good information in this book, it is so poorly written, and the grammer so poor, it is increadably hard to read. The editors did not do avery good job making the book readable."
3,"GOOD, NOT ""THE VERY BEST OF...""","I was disapointed with this DVD collection! Included are 3 clip collection segments, ""Funniest Moments Vol. 1 & 2"", ""The Wit & Wisdom Of Ed Norton"", and the full length episode ""Letter To The Boss"" Now, as a fan of the show,these characters, and actors who portray them I was entertained viewing this DVD. However, this does not represent the very best of the Honeymooners as the title states! A major part of the Funniest Moments bits include bloopers which in most cases they are not at their very best! I would suggest that anyone who is viewing ""The Honeymooners"" for the first time watch the ""Original 39"" episodes which are available on another collection. ""The Very Best Of The Honeymooners"" is best viewed by fans who have a knowledge of the history of the show and Jackie Gleason."
3,Great bit of Nostagia,"The ""Very Best of"" is a only a snapshot. I wish there were more completed episodes included. ( ie. top 10 shows ). There was one weak episode. If you are a ""Honeymooners"" buff this will only wet your appetite for more. There is almost 2 hours of entertainment."
2,ANNOYING NARRATION,WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FOUR-STAR PRODUCT WAS REGULARLY INTERRUPTED BY A NARRATOR WHO THOUGHT HE WAS A COMEDIAN. HE WASN'T. THE FUNNY STUFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT TO THE PROS WHO DIDN'T NEED ANY HELP.
5,Not quite THE BEST...,"I agree with the previous excellent review, in that THIS, ""The Very Best Of The Honeymooners,"" is not THE BEST of The Honeymooners as the title implies, which I especially want to caution those who want to purchase this. By all means, it is a very excellent DVD without a doubt, for any Jackie Gleason fan. And it does contain many hilarious excerpts of the Honeymooners. However, this also contains wonderful excerpts taken from Mr. Gleason's variety shows too. Yet what I cherish most are the bloopers showing all the many amazing instances where Mr. Gleason alone,or Mr. Gleason and Mr. Carney and other cast members, managed to sail right through them all! There is even the clip from when Mr. Gleason broke his leg in a 1954 skit during live television, yet he somehow still finished it! Now talk about how ""the show must go on!""That is incredible! So if you are a fan of Jackie Gleason, you WILL want to add this to your collection, even if it isn't exactly what the title implies."
5,To the Moon,"Despite the fact the DVD is not yet out, I would recommend you buy this DVD. Just for the TV show on it, Jackie Gleason and Art Carney are two actors who can never be replaced. The way they played off each other was amazing, I'm glad they are bringing this series (hopefully as much as possible of it) to DVD as all of them will be sitting on my shelf."
5,It was GREAT!,"I read this book and I was surprised how good it was! Usually Sabrina books are very short 1-night books, but this lasted a few nights! It was about how Sabrina has to save the great witch clock or something before new years, or every witch or magical creature will loose their powers and all magic in the world will be gone! The witches council is trying to fix the clock, but Sabrina tries to build a new one, herself! She only have a few days and she has to travel back in time to 12 historical events and get a little 'keepsake' from each event! Sabrina is running out of time and oh no! she still has to visit more places! Can she build a new clock before 11:48 Dec. 31?"
4,Millennium madness is the best!,"i loved this book! The excitment about if Sabrina will get to make the new clack was intense! The twlve short stories were different, so they were really fun to read. I think even the beginning is already totally interesting, so you are automatically pulled right into the plot. GREAT BOOK!"
2,Not a good woodworker compass,"I bought this compass at a local hardware store in Calais Maine. It looks like a good compass in the package, all metal construction as another reviewer said. But in reality, the construction is flimsy and sloppy. The compass does not lock into position nor is the pinch spring strong enough to allow scribing against rough surfaces where extra pressure may be needed. It's shape is not really conducive to accurate scribing either. Yes, it draws circles, but most carpenters/woodworkers are looking for more than that. Good buy for your kid in high school geometry, but I wouldn't go beyond that. I'm moving up to compass made from 3/8 solid steel bar stock. Buy once, cry once."
3,Ok in a pinch,"I do a lot of woodworking but I live in an RV full time so I have to make the best use of my available space. When I found this compass on-line I thought, wow, looks pretty nice.. probably fairly precision.. Well, turns out I could have gone to the dollar store and paid one or two dollars for one that would work just as well and probably last just as long."
4,classic Canadian thrash metal,"This is a classic release from one of the best Canadian thrash bands of all time. Fast, loud and nasty, the only weak point is the somewhat annoying drums (I'd like to shove that symbol up his ass!). Still, if your a metal fan, this is well worth getting. Turn it up!!!"
2,Pgroiner left the HOAX for this metal trap,Pgroiner left behind the prog to pursue this metal rehash. Why you ask??? He's lame. Rumor has it that he's going to leave this band and join Glen in a country band.
4,One Problem...,"I love this whisk.The problem I have with the plastic version is that the ball halves aren't glued flush. Consequently, there's a lot of friction when the whisk is used with non-stick and other surfaces. (The stainless version's ball joints I saw in the store were far smoother. Add the advantage of the extra ball weight in the stainless version, and you have an interesting Q to resolve.I'll probably end up using the Dremel to smooth out the joints and enjoy this otherwise great product."
1,I couldn't believe it . . .,". . . while cooking in my sister's kitchen last week I reached for the ""typical"" whisk as I was preparing a custard for bread pudding - the mixture was thick and it wasn't going very well. I then tried her ball whisk and was utterly amazed at the difference! Since that experience I have searched every basic and gourment kitchen store in my area for this wonderful kitchen tool . . . no luck. Thanks Amazon.com - I can ALWAYS rely on you."
5,Really useful!!!!,"Everytime I have a question, I turn to this book and it never put me down. Buy it!"
5,luv it!!,This company makes great utensils. Very heavy guage stainless and beautiful to look at and easy to use. Should last a long time. I ordered three different gadgets in the last week and will look for this brand the next time I need something.
5,helpful Christms stocking stuffer,this will last a long time and my daughter loves it and it was shipped quickly and will be used for a long time
5,Delightful movie,"""This is My Life"" is a delightful coming of age/coming into your own as a person story about a teenage girl whose single-parent mother upends the family's life when she embarks on her lifelong dream of becoming a stand-up comedian. Samantha Mathis and Julie Kavner deliver outstanding performances as the daughter and her mother. The supporting cast shines with stellar turns from Carrie Fisher (the neurotic agent), Dan Akroyd (""The Moss""), Gaby Hoffman (the little sister, ""Opal""), and Kathy Najimy and Marita Geraghty (actor friends who babysit the kids while the mother is away on gigs). There is even a brief, hilarious appearance of Joy Behar as a cosmetic saleswoman. Based on Meg Wolitzer's book, Nora Ephron's screenplay is believable, touching, and funny. The soundtrack from Carly Simon is superb. I loved the parallell tracks of the daughter's growing up and the mother finding and forging her own identity as an adult. Nicely done!"
3,love this color,I bought this and other favorite color balls as gifts for graduating high school senior varsity players. These balls were signed in permanent marker by teammates as keep sakes. I also purchased display cases to keep them in. The girls loved them and the colors are vibrant.
4,It's an outdoor volleyball,"They aren't supposed to be soft. The indoor version is much softer. I have played with a Wilson SoftPlay indoor ball, but I don't see one on Amazon. TheMolten MS-500-N Ultra Soft NCAA Recreational Volleyballmay also be a good choice for people looking for a good soft vball"
3,Volleyball,"Not very durable, the skin of the volleyball is soft, but tears easily. Also stitching on volleyball is not strong."
3,Not so soft,i hav the light blue one they say soft play but they r hard with in 5min your arms hurt from hitting it
4,Love it!,I am using this for practice for our rec. league beach volleyball team. We've been playing with it a few times a week for about 3 weeks now and it seems to be holding up pretty well. It's soft on bare arms and easy to see (after i bought it i worried we might lose it against the blue sky).The only wear and tear Ive noticed so far are a few little nicks in the blue cover (showing the white underneath) but they seem to just be cosmetic and are probably from hitting debris on the beach!It was a great buy and I'd buy it again!
1,bad,I received the volleyball flat. I pumped it up and it keeps deflating. I do not like it. How do I return it. and get my money back!? I really wanted this ball. I waited for nearly 3 weeks for it and I can't even use it.
1,Not Up To Usual Kong Standards,"Unlike the traditional Kong chew toys, this one is easily destroyed in a short time by dogs with moderate to aggressive chewing abilities. It looks tough, but is anything but. Don't waste your money if you have a ""chewer""."
2,Great unless your dog loves to chew things,My dog is a pit-bull/lab mix and loves to play tug. He also loves to chew.I was hoping that the Kong Tug Toy would last a little longer than it did. It was destroyed in about two weeks. Oh well maybe someday I will find a toy that can stand up to Buddy the master of destruction.
1,Just terrible,Our dog loves tug of war and chewing. He liked chewing this more than tugging. Had to take it away because we were worried he would choke.
2,Brittle,The black pieces on this were very brittle and did not hold up to any kind of chewing from our english bulldogs at all.
3,Doesn't last,"My dog loved this toy, so much he dragged me around with it right out of the package. Strangely, he even loved chewing it when we weren't playing tug. Unfortunately, it's not made entirely out of Kong rubber. It is made out of plastic where it's red...there's only a thin layer of black rubber under the handles and my dog chewed the rubber off chunks at a time! Lasted at most a month (some of it I was hiding it from him)."
1,Piece of Plastic Junk,"I guess this would work if the only thing the dog did was play tug with it while only putting the rubber part in their mouth, but come on dogs are dogs. I thought the KONG brand was a brand that I could rely on. The designers really dropped the ball with this one. The ends and center are made of rubber, but the red part is plastic and evidently not very strong plastic. My Golden was able to eat through the red plastic and have the thing in pieces in less than five minutes."
1,Ask a man who owns one,"Take the money that you were planning on spending for this toy, and let your dog chew that instead. The cash will last longer that way.This is garbage. The red plastic is just plastic. I thought I was buying 100% Kong but just the black handles are Kong. My dog destroyed it in one night."
1,too easy for my dog to tear apart,"My dog ate the black plastic off the handles within minutes of getting the toy. We had to throw it out. Good idea, but should be all once peice."
4,Still going strong,"Even though they chewed all the black foam stuff off, it's still holding up to tug-o-war."
1,Worst Kong Toy,"I have a lot of Kong products. I have been happy with Kong up until this product. My 30lb dog is a strong chewer, and she destroyed this toy in 15 minutes."
2,My dog hates it,"Looks to be well constructed, and my dog loves to play tug, however he won't touch this toy for some reason. I think it's because it may be uncomfortable in his mouth. In any event, this might be a great product for the right dog, but my American Pitbull won't touch it after trying it once or twice. Odd, since he'll play tug with just about anything else. I will say his regular Kong is his favorite toy, but perhaps they missed the boat on this toy."
1,Can't Depend on Kong,"We only let our soft mouthed lab/pit have this to play tug with us, afterward it was put away from her reach. Even so this toy broke (the red part snapped) within a week. Kali loves to play tug but this toy was difficult for her to grab, her teeth would slide off of the red part and the black rubber part was too small for her to get a grip; which would incite her to snap to get it back (snapping is a no no, even in play). What ever happened to the solid rubber/nylon tug? That old toy was lost before it was destroyed!"
2,Hard plastic,"I bought this tug-toy for my dog for Christmas thinking it would be perfect for him. He bit the corner of it to get a better grip and hurt his tooth on the hard plastic. Both ends are soft Kong material, but in between it is hard, not good for bitting or chewing. Beware when buying this product. I would recommend a toy that is made completely of durable rubber instead."
1,"Love Kong products, but not this one","My Goldendoodle chewed through it in one day. We were playing tug-a-war and then I left him with it for a few hours. He is not a destructive type, but he did destroy this one. I wish it was the Kong product all around. That part survived. The red plastic didn't. I have toys all around my house and I don't want to own one that I have to be sure to put away after every use."
1,Brittle plastic,"My dogs loved this toy. Unfortunately the black plastic parts are brittle, and within an hour or so it was breaking apart and they were swallowing it.Disappointing, as Kong makes really good products.Why they would put brittle plastic on a dog pull toy is beyond me.if it had come without the black plastic parts it would have been great."
1,Garbage!,I had this toy for about 1 hour before my dog was able to get the rubber off of the handle. He is not a toy destroyer but he destroyed this with ease! not a good product and definitely not indestructible.
1,Not a good toy.,"My 35 pound Texas Heeler had this toy for one day before she chewed the black rubber grips off of it.I found her vomiting up pieces of the grip this morning. The ""Super-strong Kong rubber grips"" were not strong enough for my dog.I would not recommend this toy for a chewer."
2,not for large dogs,"Not a good choice for large, intense chewers. The black rubber material on each end is easily chewed through and taken off in chunks by the dog. My dogs then were able to get chunks out of the harder red material once i took the rubber material away from them. The toy was thrown away in about half an hour because i didn't want them to swallow the pieces. Look for a different toy for aggressive chewers. I have a yellow lab and a doberman."
2,Two Thumbs Down,"This is not of the quality or durability that most Kong products are made of. I bought this for my two year old Lab to play supervised tug with. The rubber handles, shortly after buying it, started to fall apart. It wasn't worth the money I paid for it."
4,"Not indestructible, but works well as a tug toy","My 2-year-old border collie loves this thing. She did eventually break it in half, but it was only because I let her chew it on it too long. She goes straight for the rubber joint when she gets a chance. Frankly, I have yet to meet the toy that my dog can't eventually destroy. This one held up for several months (until she got a hold of it outside of tug games), which in our house is pretty respectable. The only tug that has held up longer is a simple, one-piece rubber one -- though she managed to bite through a handle even on that one.It's not invincible, but used as a tug, it works just fine and my dog seemed to enjoy the hinge and texture. I'll probably get another one soon."
3,Not a chew toy.,"I generally like Kong toys for my 19-month chocolate lab, Beau, mainly because of their durability. This toy is great for tugging, but Beau has successfully chewed pieces of it off when my husband and I have forgotten to put the toy up after playing with him. I am concerned with Beau digesting plastic, rubber and other non-edible materials, so I look for toys that can withstand his love to chew, and unfortunately, this toy does not fit the bill."
3,Tougher than rope pull toys,but still can be taken apart with 2 determined dogs tugging on each end. The middle attachment is a little weak due to having it made of flexiable rubber. I still think its worth the money compared to the dozens of rope tugs I've bought for them. At least I could duct tape the middle back together for some more determined pulling. :-)
1,bad toy,This toy is real easy for a dog to destroy. The rubber holding the 2 rings together can be easily ripped apart by a large dog- I have 4 Goldens and it didn't take long for them to realize that the rubber gives way.Don't buy it.
1,VERY DANGEROUS DOG TOY,"Do NOT buy this toy. We have a 60 lb lab who loves tug of war. He immediately went to work chewing this toy and was able to chew thru not only the flimsy red plastic but also the rubber, so much so that after 3 days when he played TOW with me, the toy broke in half and snapped back and hit him in the eye with such force that his eye swelled shut. The vet said he suffered ocular trauma and it cost us over $500 in vet bills and we weren't sure his eye would ever recover. Contacted Kong, they said they had never heard any complaints about this toy and were completely apathetic to my situation. Normally a huge fan of Kong products but this one is substandard and caused my normally very happy lab huge amounts of pain and suffering. AVOID THIS TOY FOR YOUR DOGS SAFETY!!!"
2,My dog found a flaw,"My lab enjoys playing tug of war, so I thought this would be perfect. He chewed through the red part of the Tug toy."
2,Don't buy,"My dog isn't even a ""heavy chewer"" and she destroyed this toy in less then 5 minutes. Does not live up the the KONG reputation of durable toys."
4,Moral lessons for neighbors,"A stone wall divides the property line between two farms circa 1920, it has been there for generations, and is falling down. No one remembers who owns it and both think the other should fix it. Hate runs deep between the two farms. A young woman of the family comes to live on one side, and begins to melt the tension, or so she thinks.Lots of description, at times more words then are needed to tell the tale, but it is easy enough to skip through those sections."
1,Not as good as we hoped,"We bought three books in preparation for a trip to Cambodia with our kids ages 10 and 12. My kids didn't like Little Brother, thought the writing was poor. I would recommend instead, Mingfong Ho's Stone Goddess for a much better quality book and a more believable plot, especially if you are trying to read a YA fiction book to help you get ready for travelling to Cambodia."
3,Stainless steel wording is misleading.,While the handle of this whisk is stainless steel the twirl wire part of this whisk is NOT. All you have to do is take a magnet to the wire and it sticks when it should not. It is your standard chrome plated whatever metal that will eventually start flaking off and need to be replaced. I was hoping for a 100% stainless and this is the second one (different brand) that I have purchased that is not. This style of whisk is however excellent and the best kind to use when making gravies and sauces.
5,An Inspiration!,"I love this book! I bought it at a Borders while on vacation because I wanted something to look through in my free moments and I was blown away! David Curtis' painting are incredible and truly inspiring. The book does not have a lot of instruction, but makes up for it in beauty and general encouragement to get out there and paint! Also, there are at least four demonstrations of paintings from sketch to final version which are very helpful. I highly recommend this book for anyone who paints or simply loves watercolors!"
2,Terrible print quality for the paper version,The print quality is terrible for the paper version. All the colors are washed out and flat. It is shame that you have to strain your eyes to appreciate beautiful paintings due to such poor print quality. I return the book.
2,Fast shipping but incomplete,"I recieved my item on time and earlier than expected. However the book was incomplete, missing half of the pages."
1,Very weak,this film suffers from bad writing& trying to showcase non-big screen acting David Caruso.he should have stayed on Blue.Nicolas Cage is okay.but only Samuel L.Jackson keeps your attention.this film goes nowhere fast.despite having names there's no Chemistry.
4,Kiss of Death,"I really like this movie. Has nudity and strong violence which I Don't care for, but I'm a fan or all three lead actors so my over all opinion is good."
3,Good story. Acting left a little to be desired.,"Frankly I enjoyed this film. I love Helen Hunt and Samuel L.Jackson. I thought that Nicholas Cage seemed a little bit amateur but as this film is 11 years old, perhaps he was at the time or perhaps it was just the psychotic role that he was interpreting. On the whole, I found it engrossing and quite exciting."
3,Who's afraid of Nicolas Cage?,"All right, so he's not the most convincing goon. It's still amusing to see him in this role. I'd say these nay-sayers need to lighten up. As a poor country boy unfamiliar with the urban crime cliches and plot twists, I can honestly say I enjoyed this movie. No, it's no masterpiece, but it is entertaining enough to be worth seeing, even buying at such a reasonable price. Caruso and (as they all admit) a fine supporting cast do very well with a now conventional plot that is at least not as droll as they say. This is probably the first time I've rated something higher than others. Strange."
3,Adequate reworking of 1947 classic,"Adequate reworking of the 1947 classic ""Kiss of Death."" David Caruso takes over for Victor Mature as the ex-con whose attempts to go straight are hindered when he does a favor for his cousin and winds up back in the slammer. Nicolas Cage hams it up as ""Little Junior,"" an update of Tommy Udo, the role so memorably played by Richard Widmark in the original. This picture did not make Caruso, fresh from TV's ""NYPD Blue,"" a movie star, but he is very good, more than holding his own against the showier Cage with a quiet but intense performance. The rest of the cast is fine, too, and ""Kiss of Death"" delivers the goods as promised, but doesn't linger in the mind the way the original tends to do. But then neither Cage nor Caruso get a scene as memorable as the one for which the 1947 edition continues to be known: Richard Widmark pushing an old woman tied into her wheelchair down a flight of stairs, laughing all the while."
3,"Nicholas Cage, David Caruso, Helen Hunt do well what they do",A bulked up Nicholas Cage and David Caruso are complimented by Helen Hunt in this almost believable gangster story. The film is not great but I enjoy this cast and found the movie exciting and worth seeing.There were no Academy Award winning performances but all are competent playing their customary roles.
3,just a flick,kiss of death was ok not an award winner although nicolas cage was great as a villian.. get this if your just in the mood to watch something but remember it is not anything too great just above the entertainment level
5,The Bible for high vacuum systems,"I'm an electrical engineer who was asked to take over a large vacuum lab with six systems used in satellite development. It was a daunting task. This book saved me. I read it cover to cover and learned everything I needed to deal effectively with vendors and technologists. I bought a second copy for the mechanical engineer that I hired to run the place. He used it more as a reference book. In other words, it has something for everyone."
3,Have your calculator handy...,"If you like SI units, you're probably going to love this book. Very exhaustive coverage of vacuum technology. Unfortunately for those of us who are not anal retentive and thus prefer to use the common lingo of high vacuum - Torr and microns - every discussion is in pascals. The book starts with a lengthy diatribe on units other than pascals, the first hint of the treat you're in for. It appears the author is on a one man crusade to convert all of us. Had I known this I certainly would not have purchased the book. Good info, in a very cumbersome form. Remember the number 133. You're going to use it a lot if you buy this book."
3,something a bit different,"Since the plot of this book's already been outlined to some degree, I'll just add a few comments. In Rose Robbin, Carrie Alexander has created a complex and memorable character, especially given that uniqueness is a rare quality among romance heroines. I found Evan Grant a little less impressive, but the story was definitely realistic and touching. The problems? While the beginning was intense and absorbing, the pace of the action seemed to flag somewhat in the middle. And I found the whole ""Ok, now that we've fallen in love, when can we get to the sex?"" attitude a major disappointment and a bit of a shock, coming from characters who seemed as mature as Evan and Rose."
5,Quality gold-fill ring guards,"Excellent product with an assortment of quality gold-fllied ring-guard adapter bands in sizes to fit womens and mens rings to reduce the effective size. The bands flex enough to allow the ring to move over enlarged finger joints, without falling off otherewise. Hands often get enlarged knuckles and a ring must be enlarged to fit over the joint yet is too large to stay on the finger between the joints; thus it tends to fall off when not expected. These ring guards do the job. Nice product."
5,GREAT,"I have applied about 10 of these to rings of mine in white and yellow gold and Platinum. they fit well with whatever size is indicated for the ring. Based on the width of the band at the sides. It helps if you have hemostats or needle nose pliers to apply these as you need to fit them snugly. I wash my hands and sleep with rings on, no problem with them turning as of yet. a definite must if you would rather not size down your rings."
4,Burkes,"I have not had a chance to watch the shows yet, so I do not know about the quality, but the DVD set arrived in a timely manner and appears to be just fine."
4,Fun Crime Show,"Does the show compare to new crime shows? No, but it is fun. It was like the Love Boat of crime shows in it's time. It is very good for what it is, a fluffy murder mystery show."
5,Rice and Beans 'til I die,"So I know this guy, and he's been eating these things at least 3 times a week for over, like, 10 years or more. Well I thought that was sort weird, ya know, at first... But then I found myself stranded at his house one day, forced to join him in a meal of Lipton Cajun Sides, Rice & Beans. And my life has never been the same since. Seriously. Ask any of my friends. A mushrooming explosion of zestful flavor (not actual mushrooms) in your mouth belies the simple and inexpensive 6.4-Ounce package. Did I mention it's Zesty?But the problem was, Lipton Cajun Sides, Rice & Beans, 6.4-Ounce Packages weren't available in any local stores. My friend (who I didn't think was so weird anymore) had to travel four hours north by motor vehicle just to buy them, year after year. But today we can celebrate our good friends at Amazon.com for making this hidden culinary nugget readily available to all (and for saving my friend a lot of gas money).And can you guess how I'm going to celebrate??"
4,"Great product, OK price, not as new as I would have liked","My family goes through these Knorr packages like crazy, so I wanted to buy in bulk online. The price is OK, about the same sale price as I'd pay in a store but I get it delivered for free and no raised eyebrows at that grocery store for buying 4 dozen packages. Win! Except the expiration dates .... all 48 packages are due to expire within 6-8 months. So if you're buying this for long term storage, you're better off getting at the store - where I've seen expiration dates 2+ years out. Buying online, you get what they ship - in my case, all 4 cases had drastically reduced expiration dates from what I was expecting."
5,Excellent first dictionary,"We found this to be an excellent first dictionary. Most things that you want pictures of do have pictures, and the pictures are very appropriate and have helpful captions (usually a sentence describing the picture). The definitions manage rather well to explain the meanings of simple words in even simpler words. Also, with 5,000 words, almost all of the words in a beginning reader's reading vocabulary will be included."
5,Great Value,"After visiting countless bookstores in search of a illustrated dictionary less than $15, this was the only one I could find. I was able to purchase the 2 books I needed along with shipping cost for less than I would have paid for this book at a local bookstore. The book arrived in excellent condition, this will be my 1st choice in the future for purchasing books."
4,a simple but good dictionary,"Around 50-60% of vocabularies have illustrations for easy understanding for the 5-8 years old readers.However some illustrations are irrelevant, for example,""habit"" there shown a boy biting nail,and explained that:1.something that you usually do without thinking 2.a type of clothing worn by monks and nuns 3.biting your nails is a bad habit. Strictly from the picture a child of 5 years won't know what it is. Other than that, my girl loves to read this."
5,Eye-catching dictionary that promotes learning,"Learning should be an interesting and fun-filled exercise be it at home or at school. This excellent dictionary promotes that. It serves as a good resource not only for children, parents and new learners of English but also for adults that need reinforcement. Highly recommended."
5,watch only lasts 28 years,"I made a mistake. I have owned my original Seiko diving watch since 1983, using it on hundreds of deepwater dives over the years, actually using the bezel to time my decompression stops, without any problems. I stopped diving over ten years ago due to health issues, but went on a snorkeling trip to Key West recently using my watch. Little did I know that the gaskets and O ring had dried out and thus my watch started to fog up. I took it to a jeweler when I got home. He told me that when he opened the case, the mechanism just fell out and could not be fixed. I even called Seiko but they said the same thing. When I came across this watch on Amazon and the price it was being sold for, I could not pass it up. I think I only paid $130 for the same watch in 1983! Glad I made the investment - maybe this one will last a little longer!"
5,"after 14 months, I still love it","I bought this watch on Amazon. I picked it over another, I think it was a Pulsar, that looked nearly the same in the photo. Well, It was maybe 30 or 40 more but I can't tell you how pleased I am. I wear a number of watches, and I really like this one. It is kind of hefty, but not heavy. Also, I do physical work and it has held up better than watches of significant more cost. I don't dive, but I do use it to shower, wash hands etc. It looks perfect. I have never really figured out how to get the date right. I don't think this is the watch, I just never tried really.I feel this is my go to watch and it fits and ""feels"" smooth and comfortable. It is easy to read when I first wake up in the dark, as the luminous hands and all that are easy, but not disturbing in the night. The watch works for work and for casual.Love it, love it. Really surprised, as I thought it would have been other watches worth more money, but this is just the one."
1,Loses time and constantly needs to be reset.,"While I initially liked the idea of an automatic watch, I quickly realized that no amount of arm movement kept the watching running at the correct time. I put up with it because I really liked the style and the fact that I could dive with it without ever opening up the case to replace a battery. Unfortunately, over time, after resetting the time virtually every day, I needed to replace the o-ring in the crown. While I don't see this problem listed in other reviews, I'm curious if my watch has always been defective, or if others have failed to mention this issue."
2,Man Watch,Got this watch for my cousin we don't like is nothing like it looks online it looks very cheap. don't buy it
3,Watch Older Model Still Good,Had to have to buy a watch winder to keep it going over 12 hours. Manual states 40 hours but 12 is best
2,Wish I had read the reviews,"Mine worked fine when I first got it, but it stopped working a few hours later. I figured it just needed a good shake, and sure enough, it started right up. Over the next few months, it would occasionally hiccup like that, but after I gave it a shake, it would start again. When I first got it, it kept extremely accurate time (less than +5 secs per week, according to my atomic clock app), but as time went on (ha!), it got progressively worse, until I was losing 8 minutes a week. And 9 mos later, it stopped for good, and no amount of shaking would start it back up. Extremely disappointed, I wish I had read the reviews and seen that this particular seller/watch has had QC issues. Based on this experience, I'm looking for an SKX007J from a different seller.For those who get a good copy, I'm sure it's a great watch, just a note of caution for those looking here."
3,"Decent watch, not so great at keeping time","I've had this watch for a little over a year and it invariably lost about 5-10 minutes per week. A couple times it actually locked up and just stopped. Once it went completely haywire and would gain up to an hour a day. This is the first time I've gotten a self-winder - it was a gift. Not sure I will get another one, or if I do, it won't be a Seiko. The last issue I had with it is that the little tail end band keeper broke. I chucked it into a drawer and haven't taken it out since."
2,Don't buy this watch,"This watch jumps 30 seconds ahead each day and it is only 3 months old. Seiko told me that 20 seconds a day is ""acceptable"". I don't find this acceptable. I have owned other automatic watches and have never experienced this. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this watch unless you don't care about knowing what time it is!"
3,the watch was defective,"The watch was slow 2 min, and it was defective. It took a while to get response as to how to send it back and get the refund. I got the refund. I am happy about getting my money back, but I am not so happy that the watch was defective and I had to send it back and buy another."
1,Sieko diver watch from mrwatch,"Watch out! I got the watch scratched on July 17th, I returned it, then was denied a refund/replacement. Amazon was useless in my claim, they backed up Mrwatch. They then didnt return the watch to my house, I dont know where it is. Today is August 20th. Watch out!"
3,Beware - Gray Market,"Prospective buyers should beware that when purchased from Mr. Watch this watch is a gray market watch and will not include a box, manual, manufacturer's warranty, or any proof of authenticity. I have done my best to verify that what I received was genuine and everything seems correct, but the watch itself came in a plastic bag shoved in a non-branded box and a ""warranty"" certificate from Mr. Watch, not Seiko. Given the frequency of fakes these days buyers who care about making sure their product is genuine probably want to look elsewhere."
1,Was great... for about a month,"I had a Seiko Men's Diver's Watch for about 10 years, and it was great. Reading reviews on several of the Seiko models, I saw several complaints about watches gaining time; the SKX007K didn't have any of those complaints, so I went with it. It arrived looking great, and worked very well... for about a month.Well, for the last two days it's been gaining between 5 and 10 minutes an hour. I just emailed the seller (I'm in Iraq and can't call). We'll see how responsive and user-friendly they are, but bear in mind your chances of getting a problem watch. Check the number of positive reviews, count how many complaints of gaining time (and I don't mean something trivial like gaining 3 seconds a day), and calculate the chances of having to go through what I'm dealing with now."
4,Excellent history of Britain's Intelligence Organizations,"Although I have not finished reading this book yet, I am already impressed with the amount of detail regarding the early organization and personalities of British intelligence agencies. No other work I have read (admittedly, this has been few) contains the detailed geneology of how MI5 and MI6 developed from their pre-WWI beginnings to their present day structures and missions."
3,Not a preferred dialect...forward says from Central Owerri Province,"Foreign Service Institute Igbo Basic Course Digital Cd ROM Version (Foreign Service Institute African Language Series)The course is so thorough that native speakers were originally impressed. One teased that if everything in that [thick] book was learned, the language would be known better than he knew it himself. Unfortunately, in going through the audio and pronounciation guides with me...I was unanimously told that the dialect being taught is not the mainstream dialect, and though people from the region this course represents have no trouble understanding the mainstream...the mainstream can have quite a bit of difficulty when trying to understand them. I was basically advised to put the course on a shelf. (And I did...because I do not see the point in putting forth the effort to learn a languange only to have it be in a regional dialect that even the native speakers do not hold the patience to try to figure out.)"
1,DO NOT BUY: BROKE DOWN IN LESS THAN 2 MOS.,"I bought this model from Amazon because of the good review re format compatibility issues and its low price. Perhaps there is something to the adage you get what you pay for. Yesterday it inexplicably wouldn't turn on. Surprising considering low use: we used it one to two days a week (3 hours a week max.) for the seven weeks we had it. Very disappointed. Of course I threw out boxes and warranties, having assumed it would last for at least a year. Online user manuals had no solution for this issue. My spouse who is an electrical engineer could not fix it. I am bitter."
2,Started Great - Fizzled Out,"I purchased the Daewoo DVN8100N Dvd player 3 years ago. It worked great in the beginning. Just recently I began to get ""NO DISC"" error messagewhen inserting DVD's. There was also a problem with freezing up and skipping of the DVD's. I bought a CD/DVD cleaner that allowed the player to recognize a disc and run it; but I got the same freeze frame/skipping problem. Via Google search for this product; I have found that many other people have had the same experience with this model. My dvd's would play with no problems via my computer.Don't buy a Daewoo DVN8100N Dvd player."
4,"Not a classic, but worth adding to your collection","This is a great, major-orchestra recording at a budget price. The first movement's opening doesn't give me chills like some versions do, but the orchestra begins to shine once the major key melody begins--the sound is incredibly rich and warm. The second-movement scherzo is the most lively and exciting I've heard; it alone makes this recording worth owning. At the end of the piece, where most orchestra's brass sections are hammering away at a no-holds barred fff, Minnesota's reads the dynamics and forte-pianos more literally and lets other instruments come through the texture. This is musically interesting but makes the glorious finale sound a bit sparse.If you are only going to buy one Mahler 1 recording, make it a classic like the Chicago Symphony with Boulez, which is both engaging and flawless. If you are a Mahler lover, this recording is definitely worth adding to your collection."
4,Enjoyable read - More substance than many books in this genre,"Wish is a very enjoyable read - devoured it in one sitting. Is more substantial than many books in the ""chick-lit"" genre but is still good brain-candy."
1,Was this a book or an outline for a book?,"This is a good idea for a book, but I felt like she took a chronological outline and barely fleshed it out. I love ""chick lit"" but this was just trite and poorly written to boot."
4,GREAT READ,"I read the entire thing in one sitting! NOT TOO romance filled.Funny, loving, soul searching."
4,Journey of self-discovery,"This book was a really quick read. I liked how each chapter started with Bella's best shoes, idol, etc. It lent a lot of continuity to the story as it showed how her tastes changed over the years - or maybe how fashion changed over time, take your pick.In this book, Bella journeys through life always seeking something and constantly trying to ""make up for"" her twin brother's autism. After about 30 years, she finally figures it out. Along the way, she gets involved with a number of different men who cannot fix ""the problem"" for her."
4,You cant put this book down!!!!!!,This book was a wonderful read! I defineately couldnt put it down. I learned a lot more about autism then I originally knew so I also found it educational as well as enlightening!I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a different from the everyday book out there! I give it 2 thumbs WAY up!!!!!
5,I 'wish' it didn't end!!,This is such a great book! I read it in 2 days and I came away feeling like I learned something from Bella and her experiences. Her relationships felt so real and I could relate to many of them. I can't wait for Melina's next book.
4,A nostalgic tale,"I didn't quite know what to expect from this book, considering it seemed to be part fun(some great nostalgic scenes that reminded me of when I was younger) and part serious (Bella's brother's 'illness'). Because the book spans most of Bella's life from eight years old until adulthood, I liked seeing her change and grow up but still trying to come to grips with the same issues she had as a child. This was the second book in a row that I've read that dealt with that topic: how to reconcile who you become with who you were. An interesting and enjoyable book."
3,Its Better than Television,"If you're upset or stressed out this is definately a good comfort read. Each chapter is set in a different year between 1974 (Age: 8 1/2, Idol: Catwoman weekdays Cher weekends, Favorite Song: Me and Bobby Mcgee by Janis Joplin, Prized Possession: Purple Three-Speed Schwinn, with Lime Green Sparkle Banana Seat and Matching Streamers, Best Shoes: Red Dr Scholl's) and 2004 (Age: 39, Idol: Me, Favorite Song: My Favorite Things (My Own Version), Prized Possession: Yoga Mat, Best Shoes: Red Dr Scholl's Hand Painted With Martini Glasses). The chapters definately have a flair for the decade they're set in. The 80's were my personal favorite, especially 1986 (Age: 21, Idol: Meryl Streep in Out of Africa, Favorite Song: Avalon by Roxy Music, Prized Posession: Portrait, Best Shoes: White Pointy Boots with Gold Piping).While this book isn't going to change your life it is a relaxing quick read and reminiscing about the different time periods is fun."
5,looks good,This product looks good and I have no problems with it. It wasn't new but it got the job done
4,Great Holistic Pilates Perspective,I love Pilates and am eager to learn more and more about it. This book is a wonderful start to truly understanding the entire thinking around Pilates from its' founders as well as the details around the exercises and mind-body connection. i really like this book and refer to it regularly. I first skimmed it front to back and now refer to it regularly. I recommend this to anyone that is really committed to Pilates. Sorry to disappoint but reading this book and doing Pilates only won't make you buff like the guy in his underwear (in the book). That requires a low calorie and low carb diet!
2,Needs more,This book contains all the movements but no real order or suggestions as to how to bundle them into a workout. There is no way you can do all of this as a workout and as a novice the average person can't come up with a plan to follow.
2,Not helping for instruction,"I bought this book hoping it would best define Joseph Pilates work and provide instruction to breathe and attain proper neutral spine. Instead, it features Joseph Pilate ponitificating at length on why Contrology is useful for curing all the world's ills, some his deductions are very illogical. I bought this along with Alycea Ungaro's ""Pilates in Motion"" which is an excellent instructional tool, one which I would highly recommend."
4,Back to the Original,"This is the perfect book to use if you are for one trying to learn more about the man Joseph Pilates himself (it has a information about him and his life) as well as learning the original movements and instructions. Unlike the different variations of Pilates (Stott, Pilates Anatomy etc.) this one is about the 1st form of Pilates, which are also more challenging."
3,Buon libro. Soprattutto per chi già conosce il Pilates,"Il libro è semplice diretto ed indispensabile a chi vuol conoscere il pensiero e la tecnica di J.H.Pilates. In questo libro vediamo foto d'epoca con in posa proprio LUI, Pilates. Le foto riguardano i 34 esercizi fondamentali che è bene conoscere, per poi paragonarli ai moderni esercizi di ""Fitness Pilates"" odierni. CIAU"
5,a minivan favorite,"Sue Schnitzer's Wiggle and Whirl CD is a definite favorite with our 3 daughters! Our youngest, age 3, runs the show when it comes to selecting songs during family outings in the minivan and ""Wiggle and Whirl"" is always on the request list. The songs on the CD are a combination of traditional (e.g., Old MacDonald) and original childrens' songs and geared mostly towards the under 6 year olds. All the lyrics are easy to learn -- okay, so the 3 year old still doesn't pronounce everything right -- and the instrumentals backing up the voices (both adult and children!) are a delight for the parents, too!"
3,Mediocre,"This rock band is great and its a shame that a dvd like this was launched. The picture quality is mediocre to bad, but the sound quality is good. If you dont like Soda really much you'll probably get tired at half, this concert is kind of boring. Soda deserves something better, im still waiting for a Soda Stereo Concert in Bluray"
3,It's OK ... Could be a lot better,The song selection is very good and the band play excellent but The camara angles are concentrated on Cerati and only on his face ... you almost never get to see him play.
2,BUENO...pero...,"La produccion de este dvd es merecedora de un despido por parte de la disquera responsable. Es una pena que esta maravilla de concierto no haya tenido una revision antes de su produccion pues, como mencionaba alguien en su review, el sonido y la imagen estan completamente disparejos.La musica es excelente, las imagenes memorables, pero como dvd musical deja mucho que desear ese defecto en produccion.Una mala imagen para la que fue sin duda alguna la mejor banda de rock en espanol...y el mejor concierto!"
5,Wonderful cheesyness,Bought this for my picky child that eats mostly Mac and cheese. I tasted and found it to be very good. Child also likes. This would do nicely on other dishes also.
4,I love her voice,"I think she doesn't get enough reconition. I know tejano music is domiated by men, but I think she can hang with the big dogs. You go Shelly!"
1,gritty and bleak,"Alexandra is a manipulative and messed up girl.It is a poor career choice to be a call girl, I guess, but on top of it she makes many other bad decisions which come back to haunt her.Some of them really shocking like when she had a choice of completing one of her ""calls"" or not.A lot of films from former communist block are very dark and very depressing and this one is a perfect example of this trend.There is no uplifting message, no satisfying resolution, just a sad story of a loser.Filmed in harsh colors, unflattering angles and blunt close-ups, it is neither visually appealing nor emotionally satisfying.Unless you have a need to to feel that ""my life is better than hers"".the cast is full of absolutely grotesque actors (amateurs?) and the only good looking one is the villain.Would not recommend it nor watch it ever again.Brr"
3,Wish There Were More,"I had the opportunity to have met Marlene at the 91st annual NAACP Conference recently, I purchased her book there. I devoured the book in one day. I only have one criticism of what could have been a great novel, it was to short, 152 pages was in my opinion not enough. I wanted to know more about Bruce's drug addiction, and do not feel a brief mention of it on pg.42 was sufficient. Even when he finally has the nerve to tell Jackie, the author does not create the dialogue he uses to tell her, but instead describes briefly (in four sentences) the relief he feels once he has told her. Marlene you are indeed a good writer, however I wish the book was longer and addressed issues in greater depth."
2,And the point of this book was...?,"I wondered where was the author going with this story? What did she want reader to get from this book? How come she did not finish the book? It was only 154 pages so it wasn't too long, or did she get bored with it like the rest of us?Bruce secret was the driving force. It was the cause of his behaviors. He got help for it, but what was it. I have two thoughts as to what the secret was, but I won't spoil it for the other readers or it there is a sequel."
2,What happen to the ending?,"After reading the excerpt, I was excited about reading this novel. Life is what you make it, darlin' had all the right ingredients of a good book except the ending was awful. It seems as if the author rushed to finish the book and left some details out. I wanted to know more about the problem that Bruce had. With that one complaint out of the way, I will say the novel was okay. Quick and easy read. I wish the author much success. Be Blessed!"
2,Totally Confusing,"I have to agree with the other reviewers. This book was totally confusing. Often, I couldn't tell what point of view was being presented or if it was the past or present. The book felt unfinished, as the secret was never revealed. The story felt incomplete."
2,Confusing,"First of all the story jumped around. I was so confused at one time, I did'nt know if she was talking about something that happened in the past or something that migh happen in the future. The story about the husband drug addiction never did really come to a full circle, and his leaving and going to a friend for advice, what was that about ? The ending came so fast, there were so may unanswered question...Total confusion, a real bumpy ride..."
5,Awesome!,"Love me some Celtic music and love me some Dubliners, legendary band and great musicians.It's an Anthology for crissakes! Just sit back and enjoy the music."
1,3 Hour Diet; On the Go *E-BOOK*,"Do NOT order this book as an E-Book! You can only print out 19 pages every 7 days. As a diet book, if you can't have it handy and accessible it doesn't do you much good. I have had to order the paperback (which I'm excited about), but have not had good luck trying to get a refund and return the e-book."
3,book,The product wasn't quite what I expected but I am using it just the same. It comes in handy for traveling and dining out and would recommend to family and friends if that is the product they wish to have
1,misleading information,"I ordered this book and paid $7.95 plus two day shipping for a total of $26.95. When the book was received I discovered it was a small pocket version of the book. I think the listed information should have made it clear that this was not the full version of the book. I could have bought the full version of the 3 hour diet locally for $12.95. I feal the advertising on the web site for this book it totally misleading. Who would know that this, three hour diet on the go book, was just a small condensed version with very little information. And to think I paid $26.95 for this!"
2,disappointed,"I've tried a couple of new diet methods and found them relatively easy to follow. With this book, I found it vague in many areas and hard to follow. It was discouraging and disappointing. Sorry but I would not recommend this book."
1,Bad advice,Eating right and eating 6 times is great but no exercise? Took ideas from well known facts and change some to make no sense.
2,Talk about a split personality,"I enjoyed the half of this book that I read--which is to say, I found the Byronic novel-within-novel completely unreadable (and I am a fan of overembellished, melodramatic nineteenth-century novels, so this was actually the part of the book to which I was most looking forward), but was completely engrossed by the relationships depicted and developed through the series of emails. To me, those were the richest and most eloquent part of the novel, and I could easily have spent another 200 pages with those three characters. (Every time I would hit a section of ""novel,"" I would get irritated at being interrupted.) So I'm not sure if I would recommend this book or not, as the only way I could enjoy it was not to read half of it."
3,Great Idea,"Great idea, that wore thin after a while. I loved the parts with the lovers communicating via email about the discoveries regarding the book. I loved the background of Byron's daughter's story. I didn't really get into the actual ""novel"" that much. Nice try though."
3,Disappointingly Perfect,"I've looked forward to every new Crowley novel to be released since purchasing Little Big as a young adult. Since then, his ethereal style of poetry disguised as prose has materialized into something more rigid and uninteresting. Instead of reading my way into being plausibly convinced in the surreal, I found The Evening Land to be a study in the kind of technical perfection that gives credence to the famous quote by Gustave Flaubert ""perfection is the enemy of the good"". Crowley's greatest work has yet to arrive."
2,TRY AND DE-CYPHER THIS ONE,"I've always enjoyed watching Jeremy Northam's work, whether in the sci fi classic MIMIC or the oh so proper GOSFORD PARK. But not even the usually suave Northam can save CYPHER from being a cinematic mess. It's premise of corporate espionage and it's mysterious underlying theme is initially intriguing and holds your interest, even though it's slow moving. But as the movie throws twist upon twist and never really validates these twists, it becomes more of an incomplete jigsaw puzzle than a complete movie. Lucy Liu struggles through a role that requires her to look seductive, but whose monotonous delivery negates any impact the actress could have. Although stylishly done, CYPHER is one of those movies you should be glad you rented and didn't buy."
3,Extreme case of mistaken identity,"Wouldn't it be sad if the high point of your career was ""Charlie's Angels""? That might turn out to be the case for Liu, if she keeps making movies like this.Cypher is a passable spy/tech movie. An ordinary-looking guy is living some double life, hidden from his wife and even (we find out later) from himself. Liu, wearing a horrendous wig, drops in from nowhere (sometimes literally) bearing mysterious messages. They live happily ever after. And there was some running around in the middle.The pieces are all good, but the movie never rises above the ordinary. It's one way to kill an evening, if you have one that really needs to die.//wiredweird"
4,Twisty Fun,I really enjoyed the ride. Lots of twists and turns leading up to a fun conclusion. There are lots of layers you go through before you get the aha ending!
1,Amerie Im sorry! I love you but this albums goes to the birds!,"I am a BIG! Huge! Amerie fan and this album simply disappoints me. There are only two songs that I play and then I stick it back in my cd case. Take it from a person who has bought Amerie's debut (which was overlooked, but one of the best albums back in 2002), and her second album, was good but wasnt as good as the first one (and I actually liked all of the songs on the cd), but this one is just horrible!! If you decide to get this cd, the best songs on there is: 'Make me over', 'That's what UR', and 'Somebody up there must love me'.....everything else sounds like she hopped in a time chamber and just said ""80s! To the rescue!!!"", but yeah, Im sorry Amerie. That's probably why it never got released in the states."
1,I DO NOT LIKE THIS ALBUM!!!,"I held out for months to buy this album hoping the price would be reduced. No go on that. All that waiting only to find out that i DO NOT LIKE IT! Soon after listening, I caught an attitude. I was mad that I purchased this. I enjoyed her other albums immensely. I cannot say that i like every song on this album. Some will make the Ipod. I can appreciate the 'ol school feel of the music, but I think it was overkill. I don't know, I just wasn't happy with this one."
3,ABS pipe cap nirvana,"I have used this product. It is a lovely shade of black and is delightfully smooth to the touch. In addition to its use to close ABS pipe ends, it can be used as a snack bowl. Every home should have one."
5,Pick Two Brings Bible to Life,For those who are doing Reading Through the Bible this is a great way to bring it all to life reading The Victor Handbook of Bible Knowledge alongside the Chronological Daily Bible by LaGard Smith. The many photos in the Handbook help with understanding events and materials of the Bible times. It's a perfect combination!
2,Boring,"The girl IS attractive, but doesn't show it all. Tease-video. Don't waste your money. I bought this because of the Amazon Reviews. But, NOW, I know better than to trust a handful of positive reviews. Anymore, if there aren't at least 50 reviews, and leaning towards mostly positive review, then Amazon won't get my money. Lesson learned."
2,Good movie too watch when you have nothing else to do,I loved this movie when I was 12....its a good movie too watch with friends late night for some laughs. Other than that its all you can expect from an early 90's Wayan's brothers movie.
4,"Funny Movie in the Spirit of ""In Loving Color""","Mo' Money was written by Damon Wayans, and capitalized off of the popularity of the ""Homeboyz"" skit from in Living Color that he previously starred in.Damon and Marlon Wayans have great on-screen chemistry as brothers Johnny and Seymour, and a number of scenes in the movie follow the In Living Color formula. Plus we're treated to gorgeous Stacey Dash as Amber Evans, Johnny's love interest. Plus there are solid performances by Joe Santos (The Sopranos), John Diehl (The Shield) and Harry Lennix (Five Heartbeats).This isn't the best comedy to come out of the early 90's, but it's still a funny movie. There's also a good bit of physical humor that was obviously improvised by Marlon Wayans. The only downside is that the plot itself isn't anything special, so it's not quite a blockbuster romantic comedy.This is a good movie to add to your DVD collection if you're a fan of 90's comedy, or In Living Color."
4,Mo' Money,This is an older movie but it's still funny to me. It's cheaper to order it through amazon versus renting it from the video store. It's brand new and delivered within a few days.
3,REVIEW OF DVD,"PACKAGED WELL, CAME ON TIME. HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS ITEM. NO DAMAGE AT ALL, OLDER MOVIE, BUT IN GOOD CONDITION"
2,wow,"This movie truly sucked and it is one those movie that will not live through the times. I always had a crush on Stacey Dash and all but i actually got this movie because I heard Bernie Mac was in the movie and surprisingly, he was, but for literally 2 seconds. Overall a terrible plot!"
3,MO' DAMON,"To begin, the movie could be better than this,but i must say Damon wayans looks good. ... he reminds meof my old boyfriend, there are allot of funny stuffin the movie. When damon fallows amber who's played bystacey dash tries to get her attention she likes it but lethim suffer some more, than the part that he's waithing with his brother also his real brother by a payphone hoping he willget the job. He did get it, and then he kissed his brother.I loved that scene , so funny than his brother replieshe's dirty. Also i diddnt like the end its too short.The only reason i watched the end was becouse that ...hot,... boy played in this movie."
4,"Not exactly what I expected, but still very nice.","I was hoping to get a pair with the same darker green shade of jade as pictured to go with an intense green jade pendant I have, but the pair I received was very light--clear (translucent in some areas) of the tube. These are apparently faux jade for the price, and that's more to why I hoped for a more consistent color as pictured. Also, the ear nuts (back fasteners) are very, very small, smaller than the posts need, making it difficult to secure earring without losing the ear nut. And, once one drops the ear nut backing, heaven must help in finding it--they are that small. I lost both the first and second time of wearing and taking off, never could find either, and had to replace with extras I always keep on hand that are more appropriate for the posts' size and adult ears.They are still very pretty earrings--comfortable, lightweight, not too large or small, and are at a good price. I wear them often."
4,jade earrings,These earrings were smaller than I thought but they are beatiful. I receive many compliments when I wear them.
5,Just to reinforce what others have stated...,"This book is a fantastic contribution to the vast array of books on Heidegger's thought. It shows the development of his philosophy over time and his confrontation with the tragedy of Nazism in a positive way, rather than re-hashing dry debates over whether or not in condemns his project as a whole. The book flows very well and Thomson presents his arguments wonderfully. The points are explained lucidly and in depth, and he makes sure to integrate the each one into the overall thesis of the book. The organization of the sections is superb, his writing is clear, manageable, and yet still revealing, and the topics that are covered in the book fit into a cohesive whole that forms a powerful critique of our post-modern age.In sum, I highly recommend this book to any who are grappling with Heidegger's thought.-G."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this CD as a Christmas present for my husband. We had heard ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World"" on NPR and were moved by the IK's hauntingly beautiful voice accompanied only by the ukelele. The version on the CD, however, loses much of the magic through over-orchestration."
3,Touched by an angel's voice,"I think the main interest of this CD is hearing Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World in this version and then to hear the transformation into the version on Facing Future which has now been featured in at least two films and one momentous episode of ER.I know many people who have heard this version on screen and like myself have had to buy it instantly. I also like the beautiful Sea of Love and his uptempo,almost rocky Men Who Ride Mountains. Next up for me is to hear more of his CDs!!!"
5,a piece of Hawaii heaven,"My husband and I just got back to the mainland from a visit in Hawaii. While we were there we went to the Old Lahina Luau and there for the first time ever we heard the heavenly voice of IZ. We were sad to relize that he has passed away because he is the sound of Hawaii. If you'll never get a chance to go to Hawaii, having any of his CD's will bring closest to what Hawaii is. His peaceful and uplifting music makes Maui seem only a minute away. He was a wonderful treasure and I will forever be a fan."
3,Seemed more like a practice session,"Again, this Cd seemed to lack the energy of E Ala E and The Man and his music."
1,i should have looked a little closer...,"I selected this CD because of the image shown on Pandora Radio while the performer was singing ""Over the Rainbow"". This CD did not have the same version. The artist is really good but I truly prefer his IZ CD that I also purchased to get the song that I wanted and IZ has many more songs I like. I know next time to take the time to listen to the sample songs on the CD before purchasing."
3,A BIT DISAPPOINTED,"I was a bit disappointed with the version of ""Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World"" on this CD. I heard it in the movie ""Finding Forrester,"" and thought this CD would contain the same version, but it doesn't. It is still an excellent version of the song though. Other than that, this CD is fun, lighthearted and full of Hawai'ian flair. Iz has a wonderful, soulful voice."
4,Not His Best,"After two outstanding IZ albums (Facing Future and Alone in IZ World), this was my third purchase. What a disappointment. This is just not as good as his other albums. For the man who has a singing voice of an angel, this was a shock. Please note too that the version of Over the Rainbow and Wonderful World is not the one you hear on his other albums and is not nearly as good. There are a few nice songs on this album, but not a good first IZ album."
3,Surprisingly unbiased!,"Surprisingly unbiased for a western program, although some of the usual western propaganda. Overall not too bad and some nice new technology."
2,Disappointing,"There is precious little here of interest to any serious student of history. Most of the film tells us things that most historians already know. And when we finally get to the actual words of Hitler, revealed by lipreading, they are mundane. So, what little gems did we think came from him in private? There are far more revealing films about the fuhrer, e.g., Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph of the Will"" and a dozen or so other productions.I did have some interest in the technique respecting the revelation of how lips are read. Thus, I give this 2 stars, none for the other content."
1,Don't Bother!,"I would rate this item a zero star, but you can't go that low! Somehow, I bought this be mistake. Who would want to hear the voice of Adolph Hitler, a miscreant who the world would have been better off if he had not been born!Save your money and don't buy it even at this rediculously low price. It is not even worth a buck. It is completely worthless. I am sure that only the skinheads will buy it, and others of their ilk! Join them if you want!"
2,Limited scope: check Table of Contents for your issue,"From the review posted here, it's easy to assume this book covers more topics than it actually does. It's a pretty repetitive book, which focuses primarily on ""Syndrome X,"" insulin resistance, high blood pressure, and heart disease. If you're looking for something that addresses migraines, for example, there's only a one-sentence mention.Take advantage of Amazon's ""preview"" option to ensure the book covers issues that interest or concern you. I've already donated mine to the library and will keep looking for books with wider scope."
5,Family and Friends' Guide to Domestic Violence,Information contained within was most helpful in reaching out to a friend who is in what I perceived to be an abusive marriage. It was easily read and made suggestions for me to be most effective in assisting my friend. I highly recommend the book - keep it on your shelf after you've read it - 1 in 5 women is in an abusive relationship.
2,like new?,"Book was listed as ""like new"". It had been a library book, had the numbers on the spine. It had underlining in pen throughout the book. I would have picked another book had I known this."
3,London Missing,"This is a suspenseful story that moves @ a snail's pace. There are plenty of misunderstandings, stereotypes & mistrust to get through. You really must understand British ladies of a certain age to figure out why she seems to be so obtuse.This movie makes you think...a lot. Well written & acted, just slow on the uptake-keep with it, you'll be rewarded in the end."
4,anatomically correct,"Although Gil's credentials are not typical, the video series is thorough and would prove useful to those studying the variety of physical health fields."
1,Terrible!,"Who are you people trying to fool? This album is horrible! This is one of the worst rarities I've ever purchased aside from Eden's Children. Tahitian Melody is the only solid song on this record that conjures up a spacy atmosphere. The rest of the tunes are in the acid rock/garage rock vein. These songs lack the hooks and lyrics to compete with the better garage bands of the time. At times, the faceless garage rock has solid, tight playing but that is not saying much. This album is to be avoided at all costs unless one is a completist."
4,Gladiator heaven with good dubbing,"Old flick, good action . . . not in the league of Gladiator, but well on its way there"
5,A Must Read for anyone interested in German Snipers,"Outstanding book with very good detail about the history of German snipers in WWI and WWII. Covers the rifles, scopes and equipment like never before. A must for collectors or anyone with an interest in snipers."
4,Good music that you can rock out too,"This CD has some great rock music on it. I didn't care for two tracks, track 10 Love Stinks, and Track 18 Paradise by the Dashboard.Rest of the CD was amazing to me just like other reviewer said he grew up listening to this music in his parent's house, just like I did. So I also grew to enjoy this music all of it. So if you love your classic rock and a good mixture of songs put together on one CD then pick this CD up and savor song after song and bring back some memories for youself or your buddies."
4,"Nice, kind of like a collage","I never have enough pictre frames so this was a nice option. I like the nickle, the modern collage feel is a nice change of pace. The quality is good, and it's niec that I can sisplay both vertical and horizontal pictures. I am more conventional so I usually prefer that the lines match up on the outside, but my friends have made positive comments. It's definitely nice if you have a couple similar pictures you'd like to show together, or so you can have pictures of all your friends and family."
2,Disappointing..,"When I opened the box, the glasses and papers fell off and I found out it was because two of the plastic hooks (hindes) at the back that hold the frame together came broken. I am not sure why it came damaged but I had to use lots of scotch tape to hold the frame together and sometimes pictures still fall. The consolating thing is the front of the frames do look attractive. Good value for money but do not expect too much."
4,One of the best 3rd Edition Books,Well I have to say this book definitely puts the Black Hand into a new light; the sect (or subsect) is just as mysterious as the Inconnu to many and this book really fixes the mistakes 2nd edition made. It clarifies all of the True Hand/Severed Hand etc.. stuff that 2nd Edition tried to confuse us with; alot of good information is given but it's only essential if you play a Black Hand in Tabletop or on a MU* (Mush/MUX etc..).If you enjoy reading or collecting the various books or even playing the Pcs I'd say buy this book
3,Mandie and the Quilt Mystery,"When I first started reading Mandie I could'nt get enough. But it seems like Mandie will never grow up. In every book she makes the same mistake and says she will mend her ways, but in the next book she makes the same mistake all over again. This has happened since the first book. I would love to see Mandie acctually take someones advice or follow some rules once! She could have saved almost everyone in this book a lot of heartache if she would have listened."
5,Costly but Pleased,"The Certificate & Ranking Belt Display is a very nice, well constructed item. One of the nicest I have ever seen. Beware though when you order....you only get ONE belt holder. You have to order each additional holder separately and you will have to pay shipping on each individual one. It gets a little costly. Luckily for us we only have 5 belt colors in Soo Bahk Do!"
2,Plastic glass is in poor shape.,I received the order on time. The plastic glass in the frame has numerous scratches as if scratched by a box knife. Black frame also has some smudges and scratches. I will be contacting the vendor to see if they will replace the item for better quality.
2,disappointed,did not realize it only came with one belt holder. If i would have known that i would have bought a better one for the price of having to buy additional belt holders.
5,"Sophisticated, naturally Hawaiian, relaxing in one great CD.",When we visited Hawaii from New Zealand in 1991 we saw the HanoHano awards at which Poliahu - a track on this CD - won the top award so we decided to buy the CD. We have never got sick of listening to it and it still encapsulates all the great things we remember about Hawaii - the sound is sophisticated but natural and very relaxing. Every time we listen to it we are keen to go back for another holiday
5,Hawaiian Music at its Best!,"You will not find a more relaxing, female, contemporary, Hawaiian music singer around. If you like Hawaiian music then you should have this CD in your collection! I can put this CD on, close my eyes and be transported back to Maui in my ""mind's eye"". You won't be sorry you purchased this CD, if you do."
5,This was very informative and well produced. This was the most detailed teaching of shooting that I have ever seen.,The coach did a fantastic job teaching all the aspects of shooting and how to score. The individual workout at the end was great .
4,The New Book of Chinese Lattice Designs,"The second best book on Chinese Lattice Designs, the first also by Daniel Sheets Dye (Chinese Lattice Designs). This is a very worthwhile addition to the first book and contains a wonderful selection of illustrations. It is not a repeat of the first book, and the larger format provides for larger illustrations. If you are into flat pattern design this just brilliant."
4,Does the job,"This thing works fine, and the blue LED inticator is a nice touch. The price is right, too."
2,Too advanced for pain sufferers,"This is not an easy routine. If you're in pain, start with Peggy Cappy's Yoga for the Rest of Us. You will feel better for it!"
1,disgustado !,"se equivoco en el envio del pedido que yo hice, enviando otro producto que no era el que yo esperaba.me hicieron un reenbolso total por valor de lo comprado."
5,ZIGIDY IZ DOPE,I HEARD OF DIS CAT FROM DIS GIRL AND SO I BOUGHT. DIS FOOL IS STRAIGHT DOPE IF YOU LIKE DAT BAY AREA RAP. I RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.
5,Genial,"Complacida con el servicio prestado y por la atención recibida. Conforme con el producto ofertado y recibido, los niños felices!!! Gracias."
1,Ripped off!,"This looked much larger and I found it under remote controlled cars. How did that happen? So small, this is rediculous and I paid [...]. Now I have to pay a restocking fee and return shipping. Lovely. I will do some research next time and read the feedbacks first from now on."
1,Very disappointing,I purchased this truck for my nephew and I was expecting a nice big truck for $20.00. But I think the picture was a bit deceiving. The truck is actually quite small and can be purchased at Walmart for $2.98
3,"Great book, hard to read","I agree with everyone else; the story is excellent, but the publisher needs to find a new proofreader! There were hundreds and hundreds of mistakes, very obvious mistakes that were very frustrating while trying to read and enjoy the book."
5,Really nice,"This side table is really, cool. The quality is also pretty good. i bought it for my mom she loves it. Lots of magazine and newspaper space on the bottom."
5,Joe Grey - up to his usual!,"I have followed Joe Grey since I discovered him several years ago. Although this book started out fairly slowly, it became as fascinating and enjoyable as his other adventures solving in murder mysteries. I particularly enjoyed the newest addition to the cast of cat characters - Hellhag Hill cast, in fact. And I also enjoyed the discovery that in spite of all of Joe's diatribes, the disreputable lady turned out to be the real thing!"
1,not as advertised,These are not as pictured. They are actually made to slide down a small dowel or thin post. Don't be fooled.
5,Very Useful,This book includes EASY step by step instructions that anyone could follow. This book makes HTML fun and easy at the same time
5,Great content BUT is PAL system !!,"Nowadays i cannot see this dvd in a standard dvd player because is PAL system, i only see this dvd in my computerI did not see the indication of ""PAL"".My big doubt is why a disc sold in the USA could not be according of the USA's system.Beyond that is a great product"
5,Fantastic!,Modern Talking- These guys are fantastic! You can see them from earliest songs they were singing to the latest. It is pleasure to watch them and hear all the beautiful songs they're singing.
3,Oxford portable file boxes,To start out with I do like the size of the portable file boxes that I received which makes them handy to transport for my WSM's.
2,Very Repetative,"A lot of the songs on here are very, very repetative and electronic sounding. Also, there aren't even a lot of vocals on some of the tracks for this to be a vocal trance album. I wasn't very impressed. Music like this is what makes people dislike the music style altogether."
2,Over priced,I replace the lighting on my house and this light met my needs. I also like the style. The only problem is that each light did not match. Each light had a different color shade of black and texture. Also the metal quality was poor. The paint seems to easly chip off easly. The light was $110 to $99 each. A comparable light at Home Depot or Lowes was better quality at less then $50. Sea Gull Lifgting needs to reduce the cost of this light and do better quality control in China where the product is made.
4,The Road to Lichfield,"I always enjoy Penelope Lively's writing and this was a different and interesting story, with a credible ending. It also helped that I understood the area in which the novel was set."
4,A Woman Comes to Terms with Her Father and Her Marriage,"This English novel by Penelope Lively is rich in the language of human emotions. Different situations occur and even overlap but the human condition remains constant.Annie is forty years old. She travels to Lichfield to visit her dying father who is in a nursing home. Over several month's time, she visits him there on weekends and comes to realize he had his own life, separate from 'being her father'. She has an affair with her father's neighbor and must come to terms with her marriage.Penelope Lively has won the Booker award and this book is a good indication of why she was chosen."
3,The Road to Litchfield,"I enjoyed this book although I didn't feel that it was great. The plot was rather slow-moving and predictable. Good but, in my opinion, not Ms. Lively's best"
3,A gender-specific read,"Most women will love this book. Some men (yours truly included) will appreciate the author's obvious skill, but not be persuaded by its self-referential, overly reflective style. If men can be emotionally/erotically described as blowtorches, and women as ovens, this book can be said to have a very long warm-up cycle, producing a modest, flaky little pastry, and leaving the kitchen warm for a short time, while the other rooms of the house remain cold."
1,Straw Man,Do you like a straw man argument? Basically this author has no idea of what the Christian Bible is or how scholars interpret it. Such ignorance would be amusing if it did not have such serious consequences. This book is not worth your time or money unless you are already convinced and just want someone to spoon feed you false pap.
5,Best unknown cd,funk mission and friend or foe are two of the best songs you will ever here. if this album was better known im sure it would sell millions of more copies.
5,Crunk Classic,"This album is great! The production is amazing on most of the songs, and the lyrics are non-stop. Most white kids on the east coast wouldn't buy this because of the ridiculous artwork, but you can't judge a CD by its cover! A classic crunked out album for those with game and respect for the pimpin'!"
3,Meh,"The acting was brilliant. The basic premise is boring. A bunch of real estate salesmen display greed, avarice, and money hunger. The salesman's personality is on display, and the display is ugly. That wouldn't be so bad, but the predictability of the plot is tedious."
4,Great craft ideas for children up to 12 years,The book had lots of things that gave me further ideas for doing my hobby of Children's Craft. Plus craft projects I could use in both After School Care & Vacation Care work with children.
3,Interesting,I expected more after reading the reviews. Not as many use full ideas as I had hoped for.
2,A lazy historian?,"Only one comment - they got a ""historian"" who doesn't even know the correct side who laid a siege to Vienna! Such basic information is widely available (and a quick check by the editor would have found the error, and the imposter historian)He says it was the Arabs where in reality it was the Ottoman Turks. Mixing the two people might be common, but surely a historian would know better.Makes one wonder whether the other info is correct..."
4,Pretty much as expected!,"I didn't know what kind of condition the book would be in (because there was no info about it in the detail area), however; the book looks pretty good for being used. However, I wish they would not have put so many stickers on (that don't come off) because now I can't sell it to my bookstore at the end of the year!"
1,"Let's Get ""To the Point""","Okay, so, to get to the point of this review, this book is a bunch of poorly written left propaganda. Several of the passages I felt sick reading. So many of the arguments are poorly written and full of flaws. The only reason I bothered to read this book was because it was required for the class. If you don't have to read this book, don't. Save yourself!"
1,Poorly written,"I haven't read that much of this book, which is required for one of my classes, but I can already tell that this book is poorly written. It is a chore to read."
4,The work of a liftetime. . .,"And for most, reading it may take a lifetime. But that might not be a bad thing.This book has two strong points: first, it is remarkably all-inclusive - the work of a master historian; second, it is inexpensive for such a massive tome.Jansen crafts a decent narrative, but the writing itself is sometimes plodding and only the most tenacious reader will be able to navigate all 765 pages.Which means that this is an excellent book for researchers and budding Japan specialists. It is probably the best condensed history that covers this massive a timeframe.But for the casual reader this book can at best be read over the years, chunk by chunk only as inspiration strikes."
5,What a great book,"After reading some 100+ reviews, the only thing I can think of is...good grief some reviewers are missing the point. Yes, the gore is over-the-top, yes, I now know more about upscale dining and designer fashions than I could care to admit...the whole point of the story is Bateman's out of control spiralling into the depths of madness, not an attempt at creating a literary masterpiece for the ages. You're expecting a trip into this nightmarish landscape to have structure or an intro-body-conclusion framework? If that's what you wanted stick to reading essays in high school textbooks. Personally, I was riveted. The book is unsettling and different in a delicious sort of way."
3,"Very disturbing, but engrossing all at once","I'm not sure what my reaction is to this book, only that it's not for the faint of heart. Despite being one of the most disturbing novels I've ever read, I couldn't put it down. It's the type of book that I hope my mother never reads- I don't think she could handle it. But it's definitely one to pick up . . . just don't read it late at night."
2,I didn't make it through,"I'm posting this as a warning The point the author makes is a valid and interesting point- selfishness, materialism etc. are the morally numbing enemies of civilization, however it's just not worth being confonted with this truly sick, disgustingly violent and disturbingly haunting imagery. This book actually made me physically ill, a first for me and the little I did read sticks in my head- a most unwelcome presence, I assure you!. Lest anyone think that it's from a weak stomach, I read the sicker sections of ""Hannibal"" without a problem, but this? It crossed way over the line for me. Avoid the inevitable nightmares-don't read it!"
3,Parts of this book irritated me but it was a page turner,"The parts of this book that got on my nerves(like describing everything everyone was wearing) but I also understood that it was part of the character(obcessed with appearances). Just to comment on someone elses review; I believe in the book he did kill the people but no one clued in because none of the characters could keep any of their ""friends"" straight. Probably because they all dress and look alike. The movie I'm pretty sure aludes to him just being crazy enough to think he did it. I enjoyed this book but I wouldn't be able to sell it because the stuff I liked about it are too hard to explain while the parts I hated are so glaring."
2,Way too graphic....,"This book succeeds for a very short period of time. At first, its a funny assault on 80's greed, status distinction and yuppieness but the scenes of murder are just too hard to take. By the time I reached the near-end of the book, I simply had to put it down. It became painful."
1,Probably the worst book I have ever read.,"Don't do it! It has been a year since I have read this book. I am still mourning the money I spent on purchasing it. I was willing to endure the blood and gore for a good read, this book did not deliver."
2,This book should come with a barf bag,"This book is undoubtedly the most disgusting thing I have ever read. I literally had to psych myself into reading through certain parts, and even then I was dry-heaving. I will never look at Habitrails the same way again. Although I found this book revolting, Mr. Ellis did make me rethink the whole don't-judge-a-book-by-it's-cover adage. The protagonist is one slick, sick puppy. I must admit that I was amused by the chocolate-covered urinal cake episode and the descriptions of Patrick's shallow friends and lifestyle. That was definitely creative writing. Although the descriptions of the cool clothes our psycho-boy wore got boring after a while, I viewed it as another interesting aspect of his warped mindset. All in all, this is NOT a book I would recommend to anyone! I would not want anyone I cared about to be as disturbed as I was by the story, and I would be afraid to give sicko ideas to those who would be perverse enough to actually enjoy this book"
5,One scary book,"I don't like this book because I'm some kind of twisted freak who enjoys reading about violent people and their crimes. No, this book really scared me. No other book has ever done that. But besides that, this book is really well written. The main character goes into such descriptive detail about his stereo, his food, his clothing, etc., that you really think: This guy is a psycho"
1,Better than Zagat,"In short, the whole thing is way too over-the-top to be taken as anything but silly and cute. However, if you're considering a night of fine dining in NYC, this is the book to consult. I haven't even touched my Zagat Guide since I bought this book."
1,Total waste of time,"Reading this book was a total waste of time. We learn that Mr. Ellis knows all about clothing brands but after the first three pages, hearing what everyone is wearing and how much everything costs was tiresome. The killings are indeed graphic but can't stop the book from being boring over all."
1,True crap,"I have never found a novel so repulsive, repetitive and depressing. I forced myself to finish it. The only book I ripped in two. The author tries to push forward his idea with ad nauseum examples and horrific descriptions that would only excite a serial killer. Don`t waste your time."
2,Just Fantasy,"Nice book to spend time on brand names. I found the characters very unreal.1- I didn't see bateman going shopping. To have that extensive knowledge he needs to spend his life in shopping malls (like my girlfriend). This is real fiction. 2- Life should not be that easy esp. when working in New-york. I am not from NY but have you ever seen someone working for a financial company and doing nothing (e.g. @ morgan stanley?). Unreal.The psycho problem looks like a cover to increase the book sales. Yes it could be more difficult for the writer to describe the ugly routine itself . I would like the book more if it could describe the weirdness of the characters without the psycho pepper.I recommend the book if you liked the fastasy world in ""less than zero"". And I really wonder how the real people who are supposed to be the real Batemans, think about the book."
4,i'm sorry you did not understand it,this is a parody; satire is subtle (pronounce the 'b' please). if you did not understand that Janowitz borrowed scenes from older works or that five pages on shaving were not anything but five pages on shaving then i congratulate you - on having good SAT scores but no ability. Your gentleman's C AWAITS: bon appetit.
2,no excuse for misogyny,"I know this book is a piece of fiction, and you can call it satire if you like, but think about all the horrible things done to women in this book. Rape, kidnapping, torture and dismemberment of women are not subjects for satire. I am very ashamed of the female readers who have given this book a favorable rating. On the other hand, Ellis' technical prowess and skill with dialog warrant an extra star."
4,"Good Book, Bad Hype",The book doesn't go anywhere but paints a decent picture of a psycho in the late '80's. It's a black-comedy tour-de-force of pseudo-sociopathic chaos with a soul-less main character but although the gore and sex is extreme it doesn't add to the quality.
3,Where's the plot?,"I saw an add for the movie and went online looking for a website...and found out it was actually a book too. So, while on my way back from my girlfriend's house in Philly, I picked it up at 30th St. Station's bookstore...for the next three days I could not put it down. I love this book. What really caught me off-guard was that I expected it to tell me a lot about eighties decadence and I actually came off of it feeling like the nineties and twentyfirst century aren't much different. As a philosophical work, it's really interesting watching Patrick find ""the good life"" on his terms, however repulsive. But this book had no real plot and the descriptions of the eighties music acts (none of which I like either) ticked me off. All in all, a fascinating book minus a few meaningless sections."
4,Theres a Little in All of Us,"The extraordinary part of reading this book is how it brings to light the fact that nothing is ever what it may seem. Patrick Bateman does things that many of us would probably like to do to those who are frustrating to us. Well, Bateman does take it a little further than I would...but the fact is he has a plan and executes it in both public and private. Now believe me, some parts of this book are gruesome enough to make the average person physically ill. However there are parts of this book that can make the average person sit up and cheer at the fact there is someone who will not be pinned down to the American standard. I believe there is a little American Psycho in all of us."
3,A Canadian Bore,"This guy's an American psycho? More like a shock-dork from the Edmonton Starbuck's. Another lame example of American escapism. You have to reach real hard, like, say that it's all satire, to find anything worthwhile in this book, although the movie is better. For real American escapism from post-Reagan hell, I prefered The Exile Sex, Drugs book about a couple of messed up Americans who went to Russia and took real psychotic chances. Ellis's book is for phonies."
1,Bad Read,This is read bad. Schreibers pseudo-latinamerican accents draws ellis' aesthetical fiction into the ridiculous. Could listen to this for only 20 minutes. shame shame shame!
1,"Great Book, too bad mine wass missing 50 pages","This book certainly is not for everybody. It's simply vicious and provides a strange look into the life of a modern psycho. BUT, the main point i want to make is that mine was missing a solid 50 pages. it kind of had an effect on the product's usefulness..."
2,Definitely Not The Best I've Read,"Being someone who loves reading mysteries and crime novels, I thought this would be a great book since I'd heard so much about it. I had a really hard time getting into the book because half of it was about what clothes he wore and stupid stuff like that and the ending didn't even make sense; I could see the social commentary of the ""me"" and metrosexual 80s, but that's not enough for me to say it was a good book. I definitely wouldn't recommend it --I only gave it two stars because it helped me kill some time waiting for my car at the shop."
5,Great Book,"Great Novel, well written and very graphic. I would not recommend it to children though it is a lot more violent than the book"
5,Hilarious!!!!!!,I loved this book!!!!! it is so god damn funny!! the things that Pat Bates thinks while commiting the many sadistic murders and tortures on the weakest of people (6 year old child at the zoo and the homeless to name a couple). i would recommend this book to anyone that loves black comedies and has a stomach for hearing about sadistic torture (i can't stress sadistic enough!!!!). a good imagination(like any book is suppose but more stressed for this one) helps in bringing this story truly alive.
4,"Ellis has a fevered brain, but it works","Do yourself a favor and read the book BEFORE you see the movie. You will laugh out loud at points, and while the movie desperately tries to capture some of that, it can't quite get the range of emotion involved in the book. Plus you will have different feelings about having identified with this guy that has such a twisted brain when you are reading it as opposed to watching it. Ellis is certainly a creative and nutty genius. You can claim that he has run out of steam after his early breaks, but at least stop and savor this book for what it is, and enjoy the maniacal rantings that it contains."
3,Daring Indeed,"Having seen the recent film (April 2000) I was curious to see where all the fuss began. The book is good, considering its subject matter, if meandering in spots (TOO MUCH time is spent describing every detail of people's attire, three whole chapters on the praises of various musical artists). The detail Ellis provides in the most gruesome chapters had me thinking ""how could he know that?"", unless he was a coroner in a past life. If you're into shocking stuff, this one's for you!"
3,American Sicko,"I have to admit, the scenes of violence in this book (which I originally read several years ago) are vivid, astonishingly creative and unsettling. When I would read this book on a plane I would try to block the view from onlookers because I was afraid if someone saw what I was reading, they'd think that I was some sort of sicko.But it all leaves a bad taste in your mouth, like you just ate something that you knew you shouldn't have. I understand the metaphorical implications of the work, but I can't help but think Ellis seemed to relish the scenes of barabarity and racism too much.. I assumed the whole time I was reading it that Ellis was writng down his deepest, darkest fantasies, and trying to write a high-minded narrative about society while indulging those fantasies."
3,relies too much on shock value,"I do consider Bret Easton Ellis to be one of the great young writers of his generation, but this book seems too intent on pushing the limits of graphic depiction of violence and I felt that detracted, rather than added to the book. It is tough to read and I'm not squeemish. What kept me going, was curiousity over how much of what was happening was real, and how much is being dreamed up by a schizophrenic mind but that really is left totally open. Be warned, there are graphic depictions of torture, murder, and dismemberment. But Ellis is a good writer and the novel is well written for sure. I enjoyed Less than Zero, and the Informers far more than this book."
1,Disappointing,OMG can this guy spend anymore time writing about what everyone is wearing? This could be such a great story if the author got to telling it and left out the endless descriptions of every garment each character has on...we get it.Save your time and money rent the movie.
1,The Sun Also Rises,"The Sun Also Rises was written by Ernest Hemmingway, not William Faulkner. I am disappointed that the editors did not catch this."
2,Terrible,"This novel was garbage. It was terribly written. If you want a good book, read ""The Shining"" or ""Interview With The Vampire."""
2,another overhyped critique on consumerism in the 80s,"well, this book is definitely less smug than anything by don delillo, though still not worth reading unless you're a big intellectual lit freak or into porn and graphic violence. but if, like me, you're of average intelligence and read primarily to be entertained and not lectured, i would not recommend this book.first off, while i can see how forcing us to read 499 pages filled mostly with brand names and pointless conversations could be part of the satire or whatever, this is way too long for a plotless story. as someone said, like half the murders could have been taken out and we would have gotten the point. i also don't see why social commentary has to be so hard to swallow. why are ridiculous situations and completely unbelievable characters, listings, etc., such a trend in 80s lit?"
1,I'd give it 0 stars if I could,"Run, run far away from this book, and don't look back. This book can turn a normal person into an insane serial killer. All this book does is talk about ""pop"" culture of the 80's, fashion, and NYC in between bloody gruesome murders of innocent people. It's kinda like Sex and the City meets... I don't know, Friday the 13th? No, that makes it seem like he has some kind of motive. Sex and the City meets Scream? No, that would imply some kind of comedy. Oh, I know, Sex and the City meets the Hitcher, not the old one, the new one where all the good people die bloody, gruesome deaths, but the killer still keeps going. Please, don't read this book, its too late for me, save yourself!!!!"
3,An Ironic Comedy - Drama,"So far I find the book more funny than anything. Yes there are parts where it is graphic, but I think the overt seriousness of the character makes me laugh at a distance for the simple fact is that I find him ironic. Ellis as always puts a brilliant twist on things. What I like about this book is what I like about all of his books. His sincerity and dedication mixed with not taking himself so seriously."
2,Distressing Satire,"Several readers have commented on the gore and depravity of this novel, and it is upon this basis that I simply cannot recommend it. Satirizing the materialism of the 80s yupsters, their sexual habits, and their unceasing search for physical perfection, could have been done without some of the extremely disturbing sequences. Ellis was reputedly depressed and physically ill while writing the harsher set pieces, which is exactly how most readers should expect to feel after reading the novel. While most intelligent readers will definitely pick up on the sociocultural criticisms and sarcastic tone, I simply believe that the exposition of such startling violence leaves a mental impression upon the reader that can - and should - be avoided. Cultural critique need not degrade the reader; Mr. Ellis has a fine talent with the written word, and a sharp eye for detail, but the application of that talent to such depraved subject matter is unfortunate."
2,"Dated, Boring, Cold and Heartless","I understand the point that Ellis was trying to make in writing this novel, but it just drones on and on. I skipped over large sections and chapters in this book (the music reviews, the fashion stuff..paragraphs about what people were wearing, etc..) and didn't feel like I missed anything important. This book is filled with useless filler and meaningless garble and gory killing descriptions that made me cringe. There are bright points in the book, and some very funny moments. Pat Bateman could have been developed into a memorable character..it was there, but halted dead in it's tracks. There are other ways to show he's shallow and his life is meaningless without writing 3 pages about Whitney Houston or a page and a half about Versace."
1,like something from my high-school lit magazine + violence,"Yeah, yeah, yeah ... in high school we used to think like this. People are so conformist -- what if they were ACTUALLY INTERCHANGEABLE? Wow, that guy has cheesy taste in music -- THEREFORE HE'S A MORAL DEGENERATE! That guy is materialistic -- HE'S JUST AS BAD AS A MASS MURDERER! Bret Easton Ellis brings these callow ideas to ... well, not exactly ""life."" Eighty percent of this book is like reading the Beverly Hills Yellow Pages word for word. The rest is like reading a play-by-play description of snuff film. There! I've saved you eleven bucks. You don't have to read the book.And by the way, Leonardo DiCaprio is going to star in the movie. ""I'm King of the World!"" indeed...."
1,Couldn't even finish it--disgusting,"This book was extremely difficult to read without even including the gore. Endless references to things that nobody cares about. So hard to follow, seeing that he uses the maniacs point of view. Also, the gore was unbelievable. I couldn't even finish it after one particular scene. I will definitely keep this book away from my child. I don't think anyone is ever old enough to read that."
1,"Is there a ""Negative Stars"" catagory?","If literature had a nutritional content, American Psycho would possess the equivilant of an African famine. This is one miserable little waste of ink and paper. Forget about the human life toll throughout the book- I'm more outraged at the amount of trees that were cut down to make this book. The story is dull and boring, the murder scenes are purely shock value...and they plan on making this into a MOVIE?!?! They could use this as some ghastly form of inhumane torture by forcing people to read it. You'd be better off taking a match to your money than wasting it on this tripe."
1,I wanted to give it zero stars but couldn't - It's Terrible,"Utter garbage! A waste of paper. Just read some of the mindless comments below ( if Amazon leave them there ). It is a book with no point, I persevered to the end of what I found a disturbingly unpleasant book, to see if it had a reason for being written, a denouement or anything. Don't bother - it hasn't.I disprove of censorship, particularly of books, but would, and have, advised all that I know may read this book not to bother. This is nothing other than the sensationalist pushing of vulgar extremes to see how far a pseudo such as Easton Ellis can go, and still get away with being considered ""A Writer""Unpleasant, pointless, drivel."
1,Waste of time and money!!!,"This book was the biggest waste of time and money I ever spent! The ""chapter"" on the band Genesis made me think Ellis himself went totally insane during the writing. What on earth was this chapter doing in this book? It made no sense at all! Then again, neither did the rest of the book! I won't be reading Ellis ever again!"
5,Has it gone this far?,This book deals with people living other lifes than mine. But after I put it down I saw it could as well be about me. My scales also weigh in favor for indifferent consumerism of life.
1,Not even for the open minded.....,"I first read the reviews of American Psycho several months ago and was intrigued by the mixed reactions. I was curious as to which side I would find myself on and began it with a very open mind. The first third of the book seemed to be building up an interesting character study with Patrick's obsession with designer clothing, restaurants and possessions and an occasional flash of his perversities. But when Ellis begins with the gratuitous sex and violence, he lost every bit of my support in his endeavor. I am not surprised that publishers backed out in putting this book on the market. There is nothing redeeming about this book and while I respect an author's delving into their imagination for a unique storyline, this truly crosses the line. Anyone who has these kinds of scenerios in their imagination to begin with borders on the psychotic themselves. If you are debating about reading this book you should definately pass on it. I wish I had."
1,just skip to the sex and violence,"I read this book the way Patrick Bateman would--I skipped immediately to the detailed porno scenes and the murders. Those were at least entertaning. The rest of the book is tedious descriptions of suits, skirts, toothpaste, muscles, etc.The problem here is that Ellis has no subtlety. His message--COMPLETE MATERIALISM OVER ALL--is banged into your skull ad nauseam. I can't be reading 4 pages of description on how expensive someone's suit is. Who has time for that? Pat Bateman wouldn't."
2,A Narcissistic Tale,"I ordered this book, excited to read it. I had heard many good things about this novel, and began reading as soon as I received it.I was incredibly disappointed. This book was filled with narcissistic ramblings and obsessive details which matter little to the story itself. The gore, though extensive, ends up being boring. There is gratuitious sex, which is also boring in its detail and violence. Every time Patrick bateman feels dread, it is ""nameless."" The story did not progress, and in the end, there was no resolution. In fact, i felt the book fell apart at its end.This book is not an American classic, nor was it worth reading. Once I finished it, I felt I had wasted my time."
5,American Psycho - Novel Review,"This is a review on the Bret Easton Ellis novel, American PsychoI read the book a few years ago, borrowed from a friend. Ever since I read it, I knew I had to own it.Finally, I have gotten around to purchasing it from Amazon.The story is 399 pages itself.Filled with all sorts of different snide remarks and vulgarity, American Psycho has very few limits. Sexual desires and carnal urges are satisfied fully!The package I got was perfectly wrapped, delivered a day earlier than expected, and very easy to open.Inside the package, sitting very snug, was my PERFECT condition novel. There was not a scratch, a tear, or a mark. It looked as if it had just come off the press.If you are a fan of the movie, or the author of the novel, I suggest getting this as soon as possible."
2,Daunting and Drawn Out,"I found the book to be extremely tedious. Honestly, I haven't finished and probably won't because more than half of the book is descriptions of clothing and other status symbols. It was effective in developing the character at first but enough is enough.I really wanted to love this book. I love the movie, I love the other Easton Ellis books I have read, and this received great reviews. But for me it just doesn't do it."
4,"A disgusting, vile piece of garbage....It is quite possibly one of the best books ive read","This novel is like hostel, mixed with a little bit of wall street. At its cire, its a gruesome novel describing in great detail the murders of many men, women, a child, and animals. Who could kill a child you may ask? Why no one else other than our anti-hero Patrick Bateman. A young investment banker with a very peculiar taste for murder and rape. And if that wasnt enough he enjoys it all (with the exeption of the child). A true american classic that is a must read for anyone."
4,Acceptable Behaviour In The 80's!,"This is such an excellent view of the shallow, Me Me Me world of the late 20th century. Saw so many Bateman's during that period. Ellis is so convincing here that one would be afriad to take coffee with the man. If your Filofax meant more to you than the lives of your 'friends' at that time, keep away - you might not like to see yourself in here. Re-read this andMetropathrecently. There are some truly frightening people out there.P.S. - don't leave your copy of American Psycho on the table if you're bringing a date home. Bad."
2,missing the intrigue,This is normally a book I would love but I found it more gruesome and less intriguing than I had hoped. I anticipated it was going to be more about the internal workings or experience of the psycho but it was more descriptive in the gruesome crimes than in the psychology behind the madness.
2,Gross outs from a flat dimension,"I would be willing to accept the defense that Ellis's quickie squib is in fact a satire of consumerism, a literary bit of photo realism if there was compelling art here. There isn't, however, and the defense falls apart. Ellis writes as if he had to submit this against a deadline, and he'd wasted his considerable lead time by living off his hefty advance. Ellis does a good job of diagnosing the narcissism of the eighties, but that by itself does nothing for either our understanding or empathy."
3,Important,"This book is hard to read. There are parts of this book which are so graphic they will make to turn away in disgust. What will keep you reading is the depth and artistry of the author, showing us the totally depersonalized character in all his empty glory. This book is not psychological, it will not touch your heart or even frighten you beyond the undeniable knowledge that there ARE people like this out there right now. Those gory, graphic scenes will bother you but they do not become real in the mind, they are as depersonalized as the main character. What you will come away with is a better understanding of how individuals like this manage to function in our society without being caught. The lack of depth in personal relationships in this mans life give his sickness free reign."
4,Perfect preface to the upcoming film,"the film comes out on april 14th, but you should first read the book. It is violent, yes, but it is also a hilarious 80s satire.please read it before you jump to a judgement on the book/film."
2,What is this world coming to!,"We are all going to hell in a hand basket. Even though I consider myself an open minded person, I believe in the right to free speech. This book goes way too far in it's graphic, graphic, graphic detail of violence. Even though I am a fan of the movies ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Seven"". This book is just too much--it just goes too far. Let me put it this way, after reading it you feel you need to take a shower, seek spiritual direction. Please keep it out of the hands of children, actually adults too. YUCK!"
2,well written but not a woman's book,"I agree it is a well written book. I agree it has a great plot, I even agree it makes a statement about America. What I feel I must underscore is that this book is UTTERLY GRAPHIC in its representation of what this man does to his female victims. It is not simply gore, it is not simply horror, it is not simply rape or murder or mutilation...I can handle all of those. It is some of the most disturbing deconstruction of the female anatomy I have ever read. Women who read it should only do so with the warning to read it in small doses and in broad daylight with only trustworthy people around. I read it at night and had horrid nightmares because the descriptions are just that graphic. I am a book lover to a GREAT degree, so I cannot in good conscience throw my copy away, but I will never sell it to a used bookstore because I want to keep my copy from falling into someone's hands."
3,Stock Brokers Are Stressed,"This was a well written book, although I would like to say that the author did a little bit too much research for the book. The way the book is written it is like he himself was the Psycho. I wouldn't recomend this book to anyone that has nightmares at the movie ""Scream"" by Wes Craven. Even though it isn't ""scary"" in the sence that there is alot of violent activity, and straight forward horror. It is ""scary"" in the sence that the man that the book is written around acts perfectly ""normal"" in the sence that he believes what he is doing is the right way of living. The book and its context was a little graphic for anyone old enough to read this book, and should have an NC 17 rating, because of its context; but it was a good book and anyone brave enough to read it through to the end should never be frightened of anything that is ever written again."
1,Horrible book,"This is a terrible book, not worth reading one page. Nothing but sloppily written shock fiction. Do not get it"
1,bad TV,"Like mass TV media, this book perpetuates the falsity of persons with mental illness being inherently violent. It perpetuates the stigma that causes unnecessary fear, opression, and poor treatment of those with mental illnesses. Of X numbers of persons at one time with an illness, a tiny percetance of those are having an acute episode. Of that tiny percentage, a tiny percentage may become violent; more prone if under the influence of alcohol. Books like this reinforce the false assumption that mental illness and psychosis *equals* violence and crime.It's a shame that is supposed 'entertainment' and 'literary acheivement'."
1,pseudo-intellectual crap,"The only thing more loathsome than this book was the main character,Pat Bateman.I despised him in the first chapter for his vanity even before the killings began.Anyone who believes this is a classic about 80's society ills is reading way too much into this.The only reason I finished the book was the hope that the character would be gruesomely chopped up instead of my valuable time.The worst book I've ever read in my life by far.Deserves zero stars."
1,POLLUTION,"The most obvious criticism is that this novel is a poor piece of writing. It lacks both plot and structure and is much too long - 400 pages of rambling, repetitive, juvenille shlock. How BEE can write so many pages with absolutely nothing to say is astounding.The more important criticism, however, is that this novel is a manifestation of the wickedness that is destroying our society. This author has taken the time to create something ugly and harmful - labouring to find the most vicious way of expressing violence against women. He is not merely commenting on society, he is actively contributing to it's pollution."
4,,"I don't think this book can be categorised - it is a cruel look at the yuppies of the late 1980's, with big bucks at an early age and a sense that everything is due to them. They are a disrespectful, arrogant and completely out of touch bunch. Just like everyone else they have their darker side, but some take it much further than others, as is the case with fitness/appearances-obsessed Patrick Bateman. At some point I wondered whether his violent outbursts were just a product of his imagination, a sign of his insanity. I found him a weak character despite his status and success - he fails at the most basic human relationships and has lost all sense of touch with reality - I think his violent deliriums are just a way to boost his massive ego and insanity."
4,"Depersonalised, clinically distant, astutely observed novel","Depersonalised, clinically distant, astutely observed novel past the edge of satire and well into cynicism. I particularly liked the intentional juxtaposition of cruelty and inventive violence with the complete banality of fashion and business peacock feathers. The tone is very stylised, an intentionally manipulative, obsessively structured cadence of increasing violence, where no sympathy for the protagonist is wanted or expected."
4,sickly funny,"After having seen the movie umpteen times I figured the book, as always, would be better. And it was. Patrick Bateman is a psychopath, but a well-dressed one, who brings out feelings of revulsion, fear, and sometimes mirth from readers. Yes, there were some parts in this book that actually are quite humorous. That is once you get past the extremely graphic descriptions of sex and violence. Ellis does a fantastic job of giving us a first-person look into the mind of a madman who seems to be coming more and more unglued. This book is not for everyone, unless they have a strong stomach, and can deal with sometimes drawn out descriptions of what every single person is wearing. Not to mention Bateman/Ellis's apparent obsession with Huey Lewis and the News, Whitney Houston and Phil Collins. Give it a try."
5,"All the dismemberment aside, Patrick's not a bad guy.","If only the world was as simple as Patrick made it outto be. In all my years of reading, never have I come acrossa character with more panache. He exemplifies the young,rich, spoiled, New Yorker of the 80's. I have yet to finda writing so meticulously centered around a man and his ego.A wonderful piece of writing that deserves 4 thumbsup !!!!"
1,There is NO need to buy this book.,"First I must say that what I deem as the ""point"" of this book is interesting. The focus on the materialism of the 1980's in contrast to (or the cause of?) graphicly violent and pyschotic tendencies is poignant. However, this point can be determined by reading about 5 pages randomly - and then setting the book back down. Otherwise, you will just be reading the same thing over and over, very repetitive scenes without coming to any deeper understanding. As reviewer Paul Bryant states (in the ""Frisk"" review) we get the point!So save your money and time, and either read a bit in the store or just rent the movie which is just as potentially traumatizing, but less repetitive and boring."
4,I see Patrick Bateman in a few business men I've known....,"My understanding of the world is colored by where I grew up...around a lot of men who obsess over material details. How we measure ourselves in a capitalistic, materialistic society is madness in and of itself. The ruthless nature of a Patrick Bateman is grotesque, of course. But I have imagined and thought that I have actually seen his hate and contempt in the eyes of rich white guys that I have had to deal with.Reading this book was like a catharsis. It made me feel less guilty about imagining my fellow man as the hideous creatures they are. That this author is obviously expressing himself as a Patrick Bateman legitimizes my feeling that there are people out there that are dangerous, ruthless, and just don't care about anyone else.Great book, great subject. I'm glad Mr. Ellis felt comfortable enough to write this general self-portrait of the wealthy class."
2,"The lifestyle is what makes me sick, not the violence...","This book is probably not worth your time. The author delves deep into the minuate of everyday yuppie life with reckless abandon, and it is sickening....more so than the violence. If you want to see people being tortured and dismembered, check out the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, at least its original."
1,A blight,"There is a line of thought that if a book is well written it is worth reading, no matter how vile the content. This is such a book. I confess, I did not finish . I was compelled to throw this away, a reaction I have only had with a few other books...Save your money......"
2,Way way way way over the top,"Let me say first that I'm not someone that usually says something is too over the top. I'm a huge 1st amendment supporter and think that everyone has the right to express any opinion they wish. That being said, this book was horrible. I got the point, trust me I did. Rich man, empty soul, worried about designer clothes and fancy resturants and all that. blah, blah, blah. However, this simple message can't fill 400 pages, and it shows. Do I need ten pages about him torturing and murdering an innocent girl? NOT AT ALL. Not that I am saying it shouldn't be printed, but this stuff is just so repetitive I often wondered why I just didn't stop reading the book. I was really wanting to see karma get this guy I guess. One more thing, this book should have some kind or warning on it, because while I support free speech more than anyone I know, this book should not be in the hands of children. I'm 23 and not sure if I should've read it."
1,This will be the last book of his I read......,"And not because of the violence....simply because it, like Glamorama, was silly, insipid, and boring. I tossed aside Glamorama half way through, unable to find a reason to keep reading. This time, I picked up Amr Psycho because of the movie coming out...but one quarter of the way through, I've started skimming. I read Less than Zero years ago and enjoyed it, it captured the times well. Sadly, it seems that the author hasn't matured as a person or as a writer since that debut."
1,A Needless Examination,"As I read this, what, nine years ago now, I remember just shaking my head. I was 18 and the book seemed interesting, well, I was wrong. I keep each of the books that I read and when the movie was released I glanced back at my copy and still I wondered what the point of its writing was. Was Ellis just beating the hell of of his typewriter/computer keyboard to get out his aggression, kill the computer instead of a person (from his fine descriptions in the book you could figure that he would choose to kill a female, but more than likely he isn't capable of such acts, so he spews them forth into hack novels.) It is interesting to see the almost straight divide between people who liked/loved the book and those who hated it. This book has no redeeming value, it is trash. I consider reading it one of my mistakes of youth."
3,Excessively stylized,"All of the characters are characterizations. Their preoccupations, particularly those of the narrator, are superficial and narcissistic. These are people who not only cannot relate to other people, they are people to whom other people barely exist. Each of them wanders through his solipsistic world, seeing, never connecting. Bateman can only exist emotionally when he is torturing, but the isolation of the city and the times is such that his crimes sink without a splash. The book is, in a sense, a satire, and satire is a form with inherent limitations. Satire does not take its people seriously. How then, can we?"
3,Exeter grad becomes Charles Manson wearing E. Zegna.,"I have never read a more disgusting novel. Some of the characters sound frighteningly familar, in fact, I think I work with one of them now. With Manhattan as a backdrop, all of Patrick Bateman's good looks, shiatsu massages, Evian, Comme des Garcon facial products, and unbeliveable wardrobe will not be enough to stop him from becoming a monster in his spare time who enjoys tourchering Sharpeis, and all sorts of other human pets. I have no sympathy for him when his Chinese laundress can never get the blood stains out of his $1,200 sheets. Bottom line, I can't finish this book--too gross. The disgusting parts are particularly disgusting, but more than that....everyday conversations with his friends from Goldman, Morgan, DLJ, etc.. are actually worse."
4,Absolutely revolting.,"The chapter about the rat, must be the most appauling thing I have ever read. I barley managed to eat after that. Where does the author come up whith theese hiddious stories? I strongley recommend this book to people with a liking for horror and blood."
1,a guidebook for would-be serial killers...no thank-you!,"One very good reason not to read this book. A mass-murderer named Paul Bernardo kept this book on his bedstand and alledgedly thought the actions of the books ""hero"" were so cool and glamorous that he thought he'd like to do the same...and he did. I'm not saying that this book is the reason why these brutal murders occured, I'm just saying that they gave an already sick individual more ideas. If you do read this book, please remember that torture, rape and murder are not glamorous, or interesting, or entertaining...these things really happen and they are just plain wrong."
1,Horrible.,"If Ellis is commenting on the lowliness of our society, he couldn't have done a better job at contributing to it. I wanted to throw-up reading this book. Shock is cheap. Reject violence."
1,I now know why they had book burnings...............,"I had high hopes for this book after all the hype it had been receiving. However, I was horribly disappointed. It should have been titled ""The Restauranters Guide To New York"". The parts that were not brain numbingly boring were so offensive, grotesque, and downright sick that this book was impossible to finish. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth for the human race, to think that there might just be someone that depraved out there. I had to throw this book away, I wasted $12 because I could never inflict it on someone else."
1,...and they're making a movie out of this?,"Must have originally been titled 'American Psycho Babble' but I guess they ran out of room on the cover. Instead of an excursion through terror, the reader gets a window shopping tour of Rodeo Drive boutiques. What a bore this book was. Ellis must be laughing all the way to the bank. No structure or plot, the reader is left with sporadic gruesome scenes inserted strictly for shock value. If the book closed with '....and the world ended.' no one would miss any of the characters. This book should have been released directly to the 'free' shelf of a used bookstore. Frankly, it heads my list of 50 worst books of the century."
1,a tragic waste of money,"What starts off as a very clever and vivid story quickly turns into a gut-wrenching and blood-soaked mess. If there was a point to the last 3/4 of the story...I missed it. I was so disgusted and mortified at Ellis' character (Bateman) that I couldn't even finish this book. I can appreciate Ellis' vivid imagination, however, this book still wound up in my garbage can. I was very dissapointed with this piece of work."
4,Another good one from B.E.E.,"It's been over 15 years since I read this, and I've seen the movie a number of times over that time period, so I'll see what I can remember. It's a disturbing book with graphic, sadistic violence, but that's what you get with a book titled ""American Psycho"". There's also a fair amount of drug use, although that seems to be a part of all Ellis' books. The thing that always stuck with me after reading this was the chapter long album reviews. The movie seemed to make that part work better. All violence and the rest aside, this book is another of Ellis' statements on American society."
3,American Psycho,"This book was even more shockingly detailed than I expected. It's very well-written, but is definitely not for anyone with a weak stomach."
2,Typical,"Nothing knew to gain here. Just the typical 80's attitude ampted up but, in an expected way. Basically just don't like it. The movie was just as non-challenging, intellectually speaking. Needs to go deeper into the depravity of human nature before exploring it in print and screen."
3,American Narcissist,"Serious, smart and very effective. It paints a wonderfully coherent picture of a society addicted to uniformity. The author would have benefited from learning more about psychopathy, however. Patrick Bateman is a narcissist who the author forces to wield a blade. I found Morton Bain's Psychopath! a much better fictional account of psychopathy - and a better book generally."
5,Narcissism To Infinity,"I had to ponder over this book a couple of months. It's materialism and misogyny make it a tough read. If there is anything positive buried under them, it's a true recognition that hedonism can destroy a man's capacity to enjoy life's simple pleasures. Ellis claims this was written about his overachieving father, but I think that is likely a disguise because his own level of fame and wealth in reality gave him access to even more decadence."
3,"Good themes, boring and monotonous presentation.","Although i can appreciate that the book itself isnt a story, more of a long running commentary on materialsm and greed of 80s politics and society, lets not forget that it is still a fictional book.Considering this fact, the plot in the book never really goes anywhere. Nothing really happens in the book other than work, dinner, nightclubs, killing etc. for me this made the book quite boring and monotonous as a story itself and the fact that it doesnt come to any real conclusion is even more frustrating.What i did enjoy about the book was the complex character development of Patrick Bateman himself. Clearly trapped and frustrated about the world around himself, he doesnt really care for anything except himself and is in clear acknowledgement of his own insanity, but never really tries to justify his actions in any way.If the themes of the book had been accompanied by a good story and plot, it would have been a definate 5 stars."
4,American Psycho,"I thought it was keen of Ellis to wait a couple hundred pages before Patrick Bateman started killing people. American Psycho, the novel is much better than American Psycho, the movie. I found myself laughing aut loud during a number of the parts of the book including the never-ending phone conversation between Bateman, and friends, and also the part where Evelyn is tricked by Patrick into eating an urinal cake. However, these comedic passages are far overshadowed by the horribly detailed descriptions of Bateman's murders,tortures,mutilations,and decapitations of many of his dates throughout the second half of the book. To be honest, I could not put this book down. The descriptions of the clothing of the hundred, or so different people that Bateman meets does get old fast. This novel does an excellent job of describing the empty, materialist, egotistical, and greedy lives of it's characters, 80's stock brokers and their consorts."
5,One of the best books I ever read!,"As a child of the 80's I could not help but enjoy the sense of flashback! From the cutting criticisms of my favorite bands (U2, Genesis) to the cutting of another sort - it was enjoyable from cover-to-cover. Black comedy set in the decade of decadence was never better. The writing was superb as well. As a serial killer myself, I can really relate to all the inner turmoil Patrick Bateman felt throughout the book. Ok, that was a joke, but the writing was done in a manner of how I imagine a serial killer would think, so it was riveting. I would write more, but I have to return some DVDs,..er..videos!!"
4,But is it for real?,"Yes, it is funny, repetitious and horrific beyond belief but is it real? My wife reckons that all the killings so gorily depicted in the book do not happen - they are merely the phantasies of our anti-hero's sick brain. Me, I think he did it. What's your view? - let me know please."
4,Undoubtedly disturbing but well done!,"No doubt this book was tough to read considering its content. But I can't deny that it was cleverly written from the view of a madman. Some aspects of the author's writing were ingenious, for example how he changed the tense from first person sometimes, as though Bateman were outside his own body. It's hard to say whether all or only some of these horrific events actually occurred or if they were all in his mind...there are many instances where it is quite obvious he is only imagining. It's tough for the reader to sort out the real from the ""fantasy"", just as it was for Bateman. I felt nauseous several times while reading this book, but I have to say that I'm glad I read it."
5,Best Book Ever Read!,"I absolutely loved this book! Extremely well-written and delves deep into the human soul and what makes people do and feel the way they do. If you can't stomach some gruesome detail then I would not recommend this book for you. But if you are intrigued by human nature and psychological understanding, then this book may be for YOU!"
3,Booo-ringgg.,"Where's the gore, the bloodletting, the squeamish parts? I'm many pages in and couldn't give a flying you know what what this guy and his buddies wear. Plus there are inconsistencies, one minute somebody's wearing a Versace tie, next page it's a different designer. He's meeting a certain woman, then it's someone else. Yes, I need to finish and give it a fair chance, but alright already. Let the chainsaw head removing begin! I know one thing for certain, Leo DiCaprio is about as suited to play Patrick Bateman as Danny DeVito! Whatever..."
4,"A disturbing, sick book that I could not stop reading.","This is the only book I've had to put down and walk away from due to its images and intinsity. I rate the book a ""7"" but would be hard pressed to actually recommend it to anyone. I would hate for somebody to read it on my suggestion and then have to face them if they were disturbed by the story. I would rather them pick it up by themselves and read it, then maybe we could discuss it and their feelings, good or bad."
1,not worth the time or effort,"I read this book because of a discussion in a media class about the uproar it caused when it was published. I was extremely disappointed. The violence and sex did not bother me in the least (I'm a Jack Ketchum devotee - I've read worse) but the poor writing style, vapid characters and rambling plot made this a torturous read at best. If you want shock, find a copy of Jack Ketchum's ""Ladies Night"" from Silver Salamander press - ""American Psycho"" isn't worth the energy it requires to read it."
1,Horribly written,"This is the most horribly written book I have ever read. Most of the story is filled with tedious descriptions of yuppie accouterments. Two entire chapters are devoted to the narrator's critique of music. I don't care! The author does not seem to have given this work a re-read. For instance, in one episode he describes a hot summer day in New York City. The narrator is running around with a woman, trying the keep cool in the miserable heat before he kills her in an apartment. Later the same evening, he is in a cab with his friends and everyone is dressed for winter weather. The season changes in one day. In another episode, he describes the tie he is wearing, but removes a completely different tie, described in exasperating detail, on the same page. Apparently this writer does not read his own detailed descriptions. Doesn't anyone edit books anymore?"
1,Boring and juvenile,"The none-too-subtle 'point' is made by about page two. Stop there and save yourself the bother. As with so much modern art, the trite message cannot disguise the lack of craft or passion. Interesting to note that the people who give this book '1' are generally literate and can spell, whereas those who give it '10' are clearly not."
1,incredibly dull,"i had read much hype about this book, seen all the reviews, and i finally when i got around to reading it i was so disappointed.i can understand the 'message' or reason behind it, you know,a reflection on the shallowness of yuppie life, 80's culture,etc, but the story has no plot, it is excessively bogged down with numbing descriptions of anal if somewhat worrying content.The books plot could be summed up in one sentence.Frankly, i couldn't wait to put the damn thing down!"
1,This is a terrible book,"Well, the most appropriate reviwe of this book would use a plethora of profanities in describing just how bad it is, but it still wouldn't capture how bad this book is. This story has no real plot, no character development, no point. A very shallow book with pointless interludes. It justifies what the Nazis' burning of books. The one high point in the book is a scene in which the protagonist goes to a U2 concert. This book is just really bad"
1,LAME...PLOTLESS...BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!,I wish I would have checked this one out from the library instead of spending real money for it!!!!
1,Violence does not equal greatness.,"For some reason, Pop culture equates Violence with greatness. If something is excessively gory & violent, it is making some sort of statement about life. Utter rubbish. This book was horrible from start to beginning. To ""shock"" the audience, he stabs a child. This book is utterly pointless. Read at your own peril."
3,"An Important Novel, But The Gore Is A Bit Gratuitous . . .","To put it as succintly as possible, American Psycho is an interesting and revealing ""auto-biography"" told by eligible bachelor and stock broker Patrick Bateman, who exposes life among the upper crust in New York via a dozen or so chapter-satires with pithy short titles. I read this novel after seeing an article on Ellis in Vanity Fair in the mid-Nineties (I believe it was the issue with Jodie Foster on the cover, around the time the movie Maverick came out.)There's a lot to like here, but the gore is superfluous and a little too grisly. Ellis could've easily made his point here without it. Instead, in the end we take his message a little less seriously.The various female characters--Bateman's affluent, outspoken Ivy-League girlfriends--are particularly alluring, querky and hip."
3,The end result of a shallow life dominated by hatred.,"Living in a big city puts an enourmous emotional burden on each and every one of us. Each day, day in day out, we are confronted by the old, the poor, the deformed, the homeless - our very worst nightmare of what could happen to us. Our membership of this huge society makes us feel like these people are somehow our fault, and that by not helping each and every one of them, we are bad people. You can't help them all. You have to reject some.Patrick Bateman's behaviour is just the end product of such a society, where in order to survive emotionally, people have to be reduced to just objects around you, where you end up feeling furious hatred towards the man in the street for begging from you and making you feel bad, to someone in front of you walking slowly, to anyone doing anything that makes you uncomfortable.This is a frightening book. I'm going to live in the country."
5,"THE MOST FOCUSED, RAW, AND HARDCORE VISION OF THE FUTURE.","Although this book is not intended for everyone, the depth of the character developement, and the authors focused concentration into the depths of demensia is as raw, and untamed as they come. The book is a detailed description of the 80's, as well as the future. Congrats to Ellis for his beautiful depiction of the modern existencialist. UNCOMPRIMISING, NAKED, TRUTH OF VISION."
2,After the initial shock it basically sucks.,"The title of the book pretty much says it all, but after you get past the morbidly fascinating gore this really isn't a great novel. It's very repetitive, and doesn't really provide much insight into why the title character does the things he does. And, every time you think you've arrived at a plot twist you end up disappointed. I credit the author with being able to transport the reader into a psychopath's mind, but what are we supposed to do once we're in there? You might as well quit reading after you get to the first murder, because everything after that is just more of the same. Murder, murder, murder, okay we get the point. Now I know why the author made it so bloody - because it's so damn boring! I kept waiting for some kind of startling revelation about the nature of man, or at least an interesting conclusion. But, as the author states in the last line of his book, ""this is not an exit."""
4,Like an updated version of Norman Mailer American Dream,"Like an updated version of Norman Mailer American Dream in a modern style, this book delivers like a AK-47. Thanks Bret, from now on,I know how I should dress to be cool. To Bret and the other style maniacs, do you know of any litterature references on the following topic that was grossly overlooked in the book: ""How to walk with a suit without crumpling, rumpling or crinkling it"" excuse my English, I am French, but concerned reader will know what I mean."
1,Yuppieville at its worst,"I have to preface this review with the fact that I did not even finish the book but I just could NOT. It bored me to tears. Especially, the fact that the author was incessantly dropping names, whether it be, fashion designers, trendy restaurants, expensive health clubs, etc... OK, so we know that is what yuppies do but do you have to beat the dead horse? I have to say, the author style of writing is also not very easy to read, or it could be that it is not to my liking. I find myself re-reading sentences in order to understand the concept. In closing, I will be donating this book to the local library for someone else to give it a try."
2,TWO EACH THEIR OWN...,"IF YOU LIKE GAUDY HORRIBLE TRASHY HORROR SCENES..THEN THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU. WHILE INTERESTING I FOUND THAT SOME OF THE HORROR SCENES WERE JSUT TOO DISGUSTING TO READ THROUGH. IF YOU HAVE A LOVE FOR ANIMALS YOU MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT READING A FEW OF THE CHAPTERS..AS THEY INCLUDE DOGS AND SHARP OBJECT...NOT PRETTY. HOWEVER, IF YOUR STOMACH IS STRONGER THAN MINE YOU'LL LOVE IT!"
1,Why Did They Publish It?,"If the idea of raping, torturing and murdering innocent women appeals to you, this is a must read. If you find the idea repugnant, go ahead and skip this one. This book should never have been published. I know it's cool today to think murder is good and funny and hip so I guess I'm old-fashioned. I plan to throw this book in the garbage and never again read a book by bret easton ellis(he doesn't deserve capital letters for his name.) Some have called this book satirical and hilarious. All I can say to them is I hope nothing like this ever happens to a woman you love. If it does, you can remember this book you loved so much and laugh at the funeral (if they find the body). Don't read it, don't buy it. Keep bret easton ellis in the obscure cesspool he crawled out of."
2,dangerous,"I found this book to be truely the sickest piece of literature I have ever read, however, alot of it was right on with reguards to the shallow materialism that is so prevalent in our society. this book basically made me nauseated with each torturous killing, making it impossible to enjoy.I have always been interested in a little gore, but this went way overboard. I hope this doesn't get in the hands of any future Jeffrey Dahmers, but it most likely already has."
1,Boring,"How can a book mostly about murdering be boring? By making it read like a catalog. Sure, the author was trying to set a scene of the self-absorbed consumer by using the style, but I just found it tedious and uninteresting."
1,Disturbing and Without Redeeming Value,"I selected this book on the recommendation of acquaintence. I have to say that this is the most disturbing piece of literary garbage I have ever read. I put it down for good after the particularly disturbing description of the torture and murder of a bum. Why do I need to waste my time on such horrible fiction? The news is bad enough, I don't need to read it for ""leisure."" Horrible book. And I have distanced mysself from the acquaitance who thought it was such a spell-binding work....."
3,American Psycho,"I like the crazy movie, but the book was too hardcore for me, and not really worth it story-wise. One of the few times I'd recommend someone only watch the film."
4,"Horrific, disturbing...yet fascinating!","Being a true crime reader, I was apprehensive in reading about a fictitous characher. I thought I had read it all...until I purchased this novel. The scenes depicted in this piece are so disturbing, I found myself having to put it down at times. The violence within this novel ranges from animal cruelty, to sadistic sexual behavior followed by horrific murders. It is an in depth look into the mind of a psychotic killer. Told in the first person, the reader will feel as though they know Patrick Bateman. At times, I found myself questioning whether he was as monstrous as I had previously believed. Gruesome acts and a complete rejection for human life always renewed my initial contempt for him. This novel is extremely graphic and upsetting, but you will have a difficult time putting it down. You may find yourself questioning whether or not there is a Patrick Bateman within your daily acquaintances. Proceed with caution..."
3,beware,"prepare yourself. this book is about a psychopath. it is also about how incredibley shallow and self absorbed people can be. AP is a fun a quick read as long as you skim over the killing scenes. written in 1st person, it allows you to analyze patrick bateman and the world which he creates for himself, which is fun. overall this book was good because it was a challenge to figure out the pysche of a serial killer. the writting is intelligent, Ellis never sways from his original intention. only read this book if you have a strong stomach."
3,Um...,"This book is like certain pieces of modern art: I was mildly intrigued but unsure what to make of the whole thing. Actually, the book did make me the greed of American Society in a new light but some parts of the book just struck me as pointless. Or maybe they just went over my head. I was a little kid during the 80's. Maybe if I'd been older during this era or had experienced the transition from the 60's/70's to the 80's, this book would have had a greter impact on me."
2,Oh my.....,"Bret Easton Ellis truly wants us to believe that all the decadence of the 80's is horrible. So horrible that a crazed psychopath can hide behind it and get away with grotesque murder after grotesque murder? I really don't think so. I'm not a jaded reader or anything, its just that when someone tries so hard to tell us how bad all this consumerism is. But I think if someone looked into the life of Bret Easton Ellis they would see that the monetary success he has gained from his books probably allowed him to buy many of the possessions listed in the book. I just don't think that people should condemn with one hand and practice with the other. Bad analogy. Just think before buying this book."
1,Best argument for censorship ever,"This book, which begins rather humorously with constant descriptions of what designer suit the protagonist is wearing, degenerates to such a grossness in description, of refrigerated skulls and the activities related to them, that, fearful that someone else in my family might actually pick up this filth, I ripped it apart and threw it away. I can not believe there are actually people that can read or write this terrible material. (By the way, the 1 star is only because I couldn't go negative.)"
3,"Murder, Wealth , and an insight into maddness",American Psycho takes you on a fictional journey through the mind of a young rich succesful pyschopath. One minute a normal snobish yuppy living the american dream in NYC the next a dillusional sadistict killer. The main character finds emtional satisfaction and sexual gratification through inflicting pain and murder apoun the innocent.
4,its a fake,"o.k. given all of the flack over this book and the subsequent film that is being made by mary harron i feel that i must point one little thing out. none of the violence in the book actually happens [with maybe the exception of the boy in the zoo and the homeless man]. The fact that one of the characters who Bateman supposedly murders is seen numerous times in Europe is the clue. If this is taken into consideration i think it casts the book in a different light - sort of like that Nic Cage movie Vampires Kiss. All in all a good read, given the vacuousness and utter consumption present."
1,Rather mundaine...,"I was recommended this by a friend, i am sorry to say i found it extremely uninteresting. The violence wasn't clever only gratuitous. The satire whilst trying to show a materialistic society succeeded in nothing but making me very bored. Clothes, violence, grooming, and butchering women. Need i say more My advice ..DONT BOTHER"
1,Who Cares?,"I'm about 1/3 of the way through this thing. I'd be done by now if it weren't for the incessant fashion descriptions favored by Ellis. These really get old after the first few pages. WHO CARES about Bateman's A. Testoni loafers? Get to the point! I suppose that I'll finish the book just to see what happens, but I can't recommend that anyone else waste time with it. In contrast to the reviews on the back cover, this book is neither important nor seminal.OK -- I finally finished it -- after which I threw it in the trash. (I couldn't even consider using the recycle bin.) This had nothing to do with the subject material -- it's just SO poorly written."
1,"stupid, stupid, stupid","If I could rate this book a negative, I would do so. Ellis is highly over-rated, this book is worse than his first attempt at writing (Less Than Zero, a phrophetic attempt to rate this book?). If this is his view of the 80's and the ""me"" generation, he is way off the mark. I suggest he open his eyes to reality, or else try his hand at writing comic books, which are supposed to be unbelievable"
1,This book does not contain a single original idea,"This book is almost completely worthless. It's a completely transparent publicity ploy, and the protagonist, a psychosexual serial killer (I am getting REALLY sick of reading about, hearing about, and being repeatedly required to be interested in) these people. I have heard the whole bit about the shallow, materialistic '80s urbanites so many times, and having lived through it, the truth is way more complex, way more human. This book is just stupid. It's like reading what the Jenny Jones show would contain if there were no censors whatsoever. I just can't get behind the ""meaning"" of repetitive depictions of the rape and dismemberment of women, followed by shopping sprees. Give me a break. It's about as interesting as watching paint dry, and about as ""meaningful.&quot"
1,LITERARY GARBAGE,"I consider myself a fairly educated person. Im well read, and understand the complexities of modern literature. This is nothing but a thinly veiled attempt at an author trying to drum up controversy. ""Any publicity is good publicity"" is the rule with this piece of trash. The book started off well and good, it actually had me for more than half of it. But it seems that Ellis gets bored and decides the best way to juice this puppy up is to dive into absolute...forget it. To give this any more consideration just feeds the fire. Its just plain awful."
1,Awful!,"This is the worst book I have ever read. The torture thatBateman inflicts upon his victims pales into insignificance beside thetorture that Ellis inflicts upon the reader. It is nothing but a badly written, dreary list of yuppiness interspersed with schlock-horror."
1,awful,"This book is terrible! So repetitive! The story is just disgusting and repulsive. There is no plot. However, I give the author credit for creativity. Absolutely atrocious creativity"
3,"Repulsive subject, good book","I found the book disturbing and upsetting, and I have a pretty strong stomach. This is not to say it's a bad book, but it is definitely not a book for my mother to read. It is truly frightening how a character like Patrick Bateman thinks, and the author makes it very clear. Something about Bateman is very real, for a fictional character, which shows the talent that Ellis has. It's just that the character is so troubling to those of us who never have thought about such things as dismembering our friends, loved ones or strangers on the street."
4,not yet finished but...,"i have to admit that i was prompted to read american pyscho b/c of the hype surrounding the film. my own university is doing an advance screening tonight which i am planning to attend. i started the novel last night and it is so beautifully written. it's lyrical but it also bites. Mr. Ellis, whom i met also met last nite, is really a genuis at the manipulation of words and the use of vernacular. i'm not finished yet but i can say it is a carefully crafted, and well concieved piece of work. it's more of a pyschological thriller than anything. the gruesome passages are vehicles that help you get to the depths of Pat Bateman's spiraling madness."
2,Disturbingly memorable,"This book brings to mind a movie I saw in NYC about 10 years ago: ""The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover."" I must've contemplated leaving the theater four or five times during the film but was always ""seduced"" by yet another intriguing scene, only to be utterly disgusted by what followed. In the ensuing years, I've asked myself why I stayed. This is the same question I'll be asking myself about this book. Parts of the book were intriguing--if incredibly annoying--(e.g., Bateman's obsession with detail) but much was unbelievable (even in NYC one would be hard pressed to continually torture and murder in one's own apt without the slightest raised eyebrow from neighbors), thus reducing the story's credibility. In the end, I can't figure out why I ""stayed"". I suppose this will remain a mystery much as the ""The Cook"" has. I wouldn't recommend it. Simply too brutal."
3,Exhausting,"This masterful plot was lost on me with the exhausting descriptions of every tedious detail of Bret's characters - from what they're wearing to what kind of watch they have on. I found myself wanting to skip passages, which makes it difficult to enjoy the story. It's possible for a reader to understand what kind of people you're conveying without stealing from their imagination. Hugo could've benefitted from that lesson also. Still, not a bad book."
5,trash,"A series of murders, so disgusting that even for this critic who is a surgeon, they make one vomit. and without these murders there is nothing left. no redeeming feature. a great script for the next hollywood blockbuster, well suited for the average 6 yrs old who shoots a 5 yrs old."
2,too gross,"I have tried to read this book twice, andboth times I gave. It is just toohorrorific.The book succeeds at its purpose, but it istoo much to take."
1,AWEFUL!!,"I wish I could have given this zero stars, only then could my distaste for the book be demonstrated. This is the first book which has both made me physically ill and been thrown away. I don't care how much I paid for it or whether I get the money back, I am certainly not selling it and subjecting others to it. It is nothing more than splatter porn, it does for books what SAW did for movies. I am sure there are some sickos who liked it but I will certainly be burning my copy."
1,Absolutely disgusting,"I realize this book was supposed to be a satire of our culture in the 80's. It could've been done without the horrific and disgusting descriptions of the murders the protagonist conducted. I am not kidding when I say I was absolutely revolted. A good writer should be able to get his point across without excess, and this was excessive violence beyond the pale."
1,"With so many good books out there, dont waste your time here","I guess it was bound to happen. A book that disgusted me to the point of not recomending it because of its violence. I'm a 23 year old kid who grew up around all this media violence and consider myself pretty desensitized to all of it, especially in terms of books. I'm a believer that violence can have a point(fight club) but it just doesn't have a point here. This is sex and gore for the sake of controversy alone. Free publicity was the motivation, it had to be, because nowhere in the 400 page novel does a plot ever get started it just goes on and on about what his friends are wearing, the girls he has sex with, and why and how he kills them. murder, violence, sex, all can add up to an intriguing story, but Ellis is more concerned with giving us graphic details of sex positions and killing sprees then he is with giving us a reason to keep reading. There's better books out there, (Basic Eight, Virgin Suicides) don't waste your time here."
2,Very demented read,"This is the first book review I've ever written, and I've read hundreds of books. I just had to write this to let everyone know that this is the first book in my life that I have thrown away after reading. It starts out sort of intriguing, but it gets way too demented and graphic. I'm into to horror and demented things, I read true crime books and other freaky things, but this was way to disgusting and it will definately warp anyone's mind."
1,What do you when you have to write a book and you are out of ideas?,"Repetition of boring or dusgusting scenes come after each other in this ""literary"" work. The writer was clearly out of ideas and stuck to the formula ""gore+boredom+fashion tips from eighties (really?)"" I only started to read this book because friend of mine said that's it's the only book that he could not finish because of gore and another one said that he couldn't finish it because it was so boring.seriously, don't waste your time, whatever the autor was ""trying"" to say can be paraphrased ""I was a yuppy and I hated it,"" spend the 10 dollars on ice-cream."
2,the designer brand names are so tedious!,"I actually finished the book, hoping that it would get more interesting. The constant naming of designer brands and restaurant review listings was so very tedious. I realize it was meant to be ""yuppie"" satire, but nonetheless...The gratuitous pornographic violence was all too predictable after a while.I had the impression that all of this was Bateman's psychotic fantasy? Am I correct. I have not wasted my time watching the film."
1,Litmus Test,"Very simply, this book is a litmus test for would-be reviewers. If you give it a good review, you should be fired. Period. This book was published to universally negative acclaim in 1991, and the reviewers had it right the first time. If one truly wanted to create the ultimate weapon in the war or terror, simply translate ""American Psycho"" into whatever language is spoken by your terrorist suspect, and pump it into their room at full volume. In less than a week, they'll crack. The parts that are not stomach-churningly violent are mind-numbingly boring, and it takes nearly a third of the book to get to the horrible bits.If you really want to punish an ex of yours, buy them a copy of this book. They'll never stop cursing your name."
2,A shorter novel would have sufficed,"I find it hard to join the group of people who consider this Ellis' best novel; not that I am an Ellis expert but this would not be anybody's best effort. At first I found the book to be expert satire about the go-go 80's, but as the book went on, I grew weary of the endless clothing descriptions, the graphic sex and the just as graphic violence. I got the point early on in the novel, and frankly as the book goes on and the clothing descriptions do not end, it starts to show a lack of imagination. I never thought it would be possible to be so bored by a book with such a premise, but I did. Strictly for hardcore (no pun intended) fans."
4,"um, damn!","honestly, american psycho is pretty demented and i feel kinda bad that i enjoyed it so much. i got hooked and finished the book in about 2 days, the whole time hanging on bateman's every move.the author creates a very captivating character, who is an incredulous cross between the aristocratic social elitist and the blood sucking carnival freakboy. the book starts a little slow, but if you pay attention to the details you can almost watch bateman's sanity slipping away from him. i found this book both completely engrossing and intensely shocking. this book makes stephen king's hokey work look like r.l. stein. so bring a spare pair of shorts and get a copy for your girlfriend."
1,Struggled to finish it.,"I was looking forward to reading this book. I was expecting a thought provoking commentary about society. What I got was a painful, repetitious description of the characters' wardrobes, a cast of characters so unremarkable I had a hard time telling them apart (maybe that was the point?) and entire chapters dedicated to music reviews. I forced myself to finish it waiting for the epiphany that never came. Very disappointing."
2,Hmmm.,"After a good friend recommended this book and hearing exceptional reviews, I picked it up expecting a really good read. I was, however, rather disappointed. The impulsive rants, the excentric mind processes and pages of irrelevant descriptions just didn't do it for me. Overall I was left wondering what all the fuss was about..."
4,Too much descriptions,"Generally speaking the book is great. Nevertheless, I watched the film unless of finish reading it because of it was to slow to move. The author keep on describing everything all the time. Clothes and meals are described over pages, which is fine at the begining but start to become enoying after a few dozens of pages."
5,Keeps one reading at least 20 pages a day.,"I got this book 2 months ago and i have been a bit lazy when it comes to reading period, but I manage to do it at least 4 times a week. American Psycho is a book I've been reading everyday though. My favorite parts of the book is when he's doing narration. A lot of sex and violence in the book, but don't take it so seriously. American Psycho is more of a dark comedy than anything, a very dark comedy."
3,Caused me to lie awake at night,"Well...I'm not sure if I'm glad I read this ""classic"" or not, but it IS good for sparking some riveting debates. Is Patrick Bateman psychotic? A loser who happens to be a compulsive liar (and an extremely convincing daydreamer)? Or is he a bit of both? The torture scenes are horrifying to read (though I kept on reading, every time), but most horrific is the shallow, empty society that Ellis portrays. Was this really what Manhattan in the 1980s was like? You hate to imagine it, but the worst part is, it's not all that difficult TO imagine. At least Patrick was honest about his depravity, which is more than I can say for the other characters in the book. God help us all."
5,American Psycho,"This book is an incredibly calculated attack on the plastic culture of American businessmen, who has lost touch with reality. The pro(ant?)agonist, Patrick, has excelled at so much at a high cost to his sanity that only murder and vile rape seem to give him a sense of achievement. A good look at how Americans are expected to excel and suceed at any cost, even to their own minds..."
3,I'm wearing an Armani suit with a Versaci tie...my belt is a,"The book is mentally inticing...the problem is that 150 of it's 399 pages are pure description. I understand that it is imperative to the story to identify the characters with a materialistic worth. However, Easton Ellis takes the premise to far. It would be a far better novel if he concentrated on the story, rather then the clothes on their backs. I found myself wanting to skip the desciption and read of the graphic tale of the ""psycho"". This book is well worth the read...if you can live through the fashion advertisments."
5,I couldn't stop laughing,"American Psycho is one of the few books I have ever read that REALLY made me laugh out loud. Patrick Bateman is like so many people that I met whilst climbing the corporate ladder in the eighties (I even saw some sad, long forgotten reflections of myself in there). Yes it's graphic. Yes it's violent. It's also funny in a way that few other satires are. Do yourself a favour and read the book!"
2,"Too explicit for my tastes, that's saying something.","I came to this book after thoroughly enjoying the movie adaptation; fantastic movie. In this case I found the book to be a little tedius and quite explicit, at times. I like to consider myself just as decensitized to violence as any North American in the 21st century, but the amount of gruesome detail Mr. Ellis goes into, is too much for my tastes.2.5 STARS"
4,Irresponsible to Ignore,"American Psycho is surely one of the single most vile reading experiences available. The descriptions of Patrick Bateman's atrocities to both the human body and the human soul are unrelenting and impossible to turn away from. This is not due soley to the shockingly graphic violence, but also to the methodical indifference in which it is all related to the reader. How completely appauling it is when the realization one's life is about to end in the most horrific fashion imaginable can be related matter-of-factly by a character who simply cannot bring himself to care. Like Last Year's Fight Club, American Psycho shows its readers a sad world who's central character discovers that even the most extreme experience cannot allow him to feel through the numbness he's helped to cultivate in and around himself. Ellis' novel is as impossible to enjoy as it is to condemn as mere exploitation. It is a bold and important work."
4,"Very good, definitely a different read","The reader that previously gave this book 1 star complained about how Ellis describes in excruciating detail the clothing worn by every character that is introduced. The clothing is described detail by agonizing detail for a reason! Ellis is trying to show us how Patrick Bateman's mind works, what he thinks. Bateman is a very materialistic and image obssessed man, and we are being shown how much attention and value he pays to superficial things, such as clothing. That is the point (or I should say A point) of the book: to describe the excess and materialism with which the character lives.This novel would not have been as poignant if the details weren't included the way they were"
4,A little Bateman in all of us,"Ellis' American Pyscho is one of the most finely crafted pieces of literature in this day and age. Although written in 1991, Ellis' magnetism and diction portray events present in the metropolisses of our great nation to a tee. Read this book for the gore, the sex, the drugs, or simply for the witty asides delivered by Patrick himself. The movie does not do Bateman justice, rather, the book itself makes him out to be a star, a hero, and almost a sort of role model. Three cheers for Bret!"
4,"20th century ""les miserables""","Get through the mind-numbing violence and banal patter, and what do you have? An able vehicle in which two timeless themes are ""hammered"" home: All that glitters is not gold, and man's inhumanity to man.I was struck by the multiple references throughout the novel to ubiquitous ""Les Miserables"" advertisements, etc. Isn't this a particularly delicious comparison, spanning two centuries--Ellis's Manhattan in the 1980's and Hugo's Paris in the 1780's? Perhaps the more things change, the more they stay the same?Unlike Valjean, no redemption for Bateman, though. This is, after all, not an exit...."
4,An aesthetic illusion,"Quite why I was riveted to this book would be something for my shrink to work out - if I had one! It is repetetive, grotesque and pornographic and yet the underlying point of the book is brought across very subtly and powerfully. By the end of it you are numbed to the horror you have been subjected to in much the same way as Pat Bateman is in his own life. The book reflects a lifestyle that many would like to believe they have left behind in the 80's but I contend that very few actually have. Living here and living a similar corporate lifestyle gave me something in common with Pat, which I suppose was the hook. It wasn't too much of a stretch to understand his complete bewilderment and behaviour at some points, which is a fairly horrifying admission. I suppose I would recommend this book on the basis that it will make you realise you're not as far removed from the emptiness and extremeties of Pat Bateman's life as you would like to think."
4,re: clothing discrepancies,"I noticed the same discrepancies but am inclined to believe they are intentional. Bateman's narrative wavers in other ways as well--most noticibly in the numerous occasions in which he misidentifies people. There are also times when he quotes himself saying very horrific things to people who, in turn, fail to acknowledge those comments and continue on with the conversation. I think all these ""discrepancies,"" including the mistakes Batemen makes in terms of apparel, can be intepreted as part of a portrait Ellis hopes to create of a diseased man possessed by self-image and bloodlust."
1,American repetitive,It was torture trying to finish this book. I could have stopped after 100 pages and not missed a thing. It's so redundant - the same episodes over and over and over. No change. What a waste of paper. Usually I'll save a book or leave it somewhere to pass it on. This one I tore in two and recycled.
5,not everyone can stomache it,"i really love this book. this is a very discriptive and detailed book, and not for weak stomaches. its grotesquely detailed. but wonderfully written. i highly suggest it if you can stomache it. some desctiptions are along the lines of being x-rated"
2,OK,"this is book about a young yuppie in nyc near the end of the 80's. the main character is also a psychopathic killer, or is fantasizing about killing-it is hard to tell. while there are very well written explicit scenes the majority of the book is detailed desriptions of clothing and gourmet entrees plus vapid conversation and thoughts. i think the author is doing this to make us feel the characters emptiness his shallowness, the lack of substance in him and those around him-but it goes too far and is tedious...you have to wonder if this author is a fashion designer when he isnt writing.much of the time it is a chore to read..interspersed with interesting peaks.On a deeper level it shows again that money isnt everything..im going to rent the video and see if its any better."
3,* * *JUST A LITTLE BIT ICKY AND A WHOLE LOT STICKY * *,"My reading group just finished a book called Pseudo Cool in which there was quite some graphic human relations described. It caused several of the ladies in our group to blush. Well, thanks to my husband's suggestion, our reading group will no longer be complaining about Pseudo Cool. I literally felt like throwing up after reading some parts of this book. An author's talent rests in his ability to get people to read. For this, Ellis has done a fine job. But I look forward, along with the ladies in my reading group, for something much more uplifting from this author in the future."
3,One joke wonder,"American Pyscho does have it's moments but mainly it is flat one joke wonder. The author has brand names as well as other social observations down quite nicely. The thing is that is all it is, this book could of been shorter than it was. It feel padded."
4,A Modern Classic,Hard to read at times? Yes. But well worth the effort. The violence is graphic but what gets you through is the feeling that Bateman is not really real. I dont believe he is actually killing people (a theme played more explicitly in the faithful film adaption)There is just no way he could have gone on so long without being caught.The book is satire. Funny since the decade it is placed in (80's) ended only a year before this book was published.Ellis has a gift for writing. The first person/present tense narration is usual but works so well in this novel.A great read you wont soon forget. The only flaw being it has no real story and ends rather suddenly with any resolution.
4,hilarious social commentary,"even though this book was pretty graphic for my tastes [at some points i felt a little queesy or had to skip over sections...] ellis's wit and satiric humor made me keep on reading. i could picture these characters being people i know -- totally oblivious to the fact that a psycho was sitting across the table from them, dispite his outbursts and confessions. if you can stomach it, you should definitely read this book."
1,Author attempts to use violence and gore to mask boredom.,This book is really boring. It is a blatant attempt to use violence to sell copies by an author who has no ability to tell an interesting story. Don't bother.
4,The Positive Aspects of Negative Thinking,"This book seems to be a waste of time when you start to read all those brands and the daily stuff of Bateman. But before you comment on something think it twice... Is this what we will have in near future. Misery, greed etc and the bad instincts controlling our movements but not our positive thougts. I guess this book is more than a novel but a science fiction."
1,"Nauseating, and completely devoid of literary value","I am appalled at how many readers gave this book a glowing review. I was slightly interested at first in how the character moves from his empty upscale Manhattan existence to his nocturnal visits to the underworld. But after a few back and forths from Bateman, yuppie stockbroker to Bateman, hero-psycho-killer and I was not only ready to lose my lunch but I was monumentally bored at the flat one-dimensional feel of this story.It takes more than an ability to blithely describe murderous scenes of rape, decapitation, and gore to make a novel compelling. I read Less than Zero years ago with and felt it was flawed but mildly interesting. I realized that Ellis was still young and perhaps would hone his craft. He hasn't!!"
1,Repetitive and boring,"This is one of the most disappointing reads I have come accross for a long time. The author presents fashion, food, sex and death or injury as the interests of his main characters and repeats himself time and again. The circle of events is broken up on occasion by a mindless assessment of Phil Collins and Huey Louis's musical careers. At least I have found a book which sets the lower standard against which I can judge any future books I read. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
4,"5 stars for the book, 3 for my reaction","When my book club picked this book, I was worried. I didn't live in America during the 1980s, so I don't really know what it was like. The pages and pages of brand-conscious description at first confused me, but then I understood that Ellis was creating a dizzying world of superficiality and bizarre values. His psychopath camoflauges himself in the shallow world of 1980s NYC astonishingly easily.It should be noted that the violence is extremely graphic. This book is not for those with weak stomachs.If you want more books with deep characterization and a wild plot, tryRabid: A NovelorBlack and Blue (Oprah's Book Club).Minna"
1,"Hey, it's America","I read this book about 10 years ago, when I was reviewing it for my college newspaper. Our campus bookstore had banned it at the request (demand?) of the university Women's Center. I hated the book and said so in the review but wrote an accompanying editorial in which I chastised the bookstore manager for censoring the book and buckling under pressure from the women's center.Bottom line...the book has no social or literary redeeming value and I can't imagine anyone actually enjoying it. But people will read it (and now, go see the movie) because it's so over-the-top. C'mon...is that really what the 80s were all about?"
1,too blatantly obvious,"if i could give this book 0 stars, i would, but unfortunately, amazon.com only offers at least 1 star. this book was horrible. ellis clouds a truly interesting plot by displaying a bunch of gimmicks to supposedly shock the reader. there is no development of plot whatsoever! it just chronicles the life of a rich, vain murderer all the way to the incomplete ending. mr. ellis must stop writing. there is no hint of an accomplished author here. i've read Less Than Zero and Rules of Attraction and i've realized that all of his books have the same theme. Come on! this book was a completely utter bore. there are people who think his books are profound, but i am an avid reader who can tell what is great an what isnt. there is an entire chapter on Whitney Houston!!! no development, no interest, no plot, no nothing. zero stars!"
4,I thought I hated this book . . . but it's a fine line.,"I really thought I hated this book. It is brutal -- the character, the subject matter, and particularly the detail of the writing. I was incensed at certain parts, and yet, I am suggesting others read it. The obsessive compulsive disorder of the main characture is so incredibly depicted -- it is really a work of art. Any book that can provoke such incredible emotion has to be worth a read."
5,Better than I'd ever expected!,"First of, watch the movie first. If I had read this before seeing the movie, I'd never have given the movie a chance. And the movie's too good to ruin like that.I really like the Ellis' style. I admit I glossed over the musician monologues a bit, but I'm 22, I'm not familiar with them. I enjoyed the sparactic paragraphs, and the abrupt sentence endings. It was fun to read about some of the events that were glossed over in the movie. (listen to the phone call with his lawyer) It's a fun read, I could barely put it down, and was sad when it ended. I've read more of Ellis' work and, while it's still good, isn't quite up to par with American Psycho."
4,patrick bateman as one of us,"American Psycho is Patrick Bateman, the man of today. The character tells his daily story through tableaux depicting an outside made of wasting wealth, fashionable appearance, and absolute lack of any concrete relation and feeling. His inner world is one of total psychosis generating rapes, murders and perverted torture.But you can't blame him thoroughly, he needs love as everybody do. Through the means of the first person narrator, Ellis succeeds in avoiding a moral point of view, and he makes talk the monster-character with his voice. You read his story, and you early replace your reproach with the voids of American culture and the dramas of global society."
2,Unsatisfying,"A boring and superficial novel which doesn't give the reader a clue about this very elementary question: WHY? Read J.G. Ballard's ""Super Cannes"" for the answer."
4,Symbolic with Madness,A decent book for those into twisted gore. The author lavishes on every detail of what a yuppie society might cherish in the corrupt world of the book. Tastefully untasty!
5,Delightfully Wicked,"This book I imagine is not for everyone...those who would be unable to get past the brutal violence for one.But to me the thing so striking about this novel is the fact that I would have a hard time saying I didn't like the lead character, Patrick Bateman. I think most people having read the book would agree with me. He's charming, witty, and incredibly funny.For a seriously dark, disturbing book, I sure laughed my head off! I think the humor is something many people overlook.I don't know exactly who I would go about recommending this book to. But if you have seen the movie which does an incredible job of bring Mr. Bateman to life, the book is even better. More grizzly murders and comedic situations. A great combination?"
4,Interesting,"I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie and I am glad I did. Although American Psycho is not a GREAT read, it is compelling and keeps the reader tuned in at all times. If you have a weak stomach dont read this book. I thought it was very interesting how Bateman could one minute kill someone and the next second hes discussing his favorite type of bottled water. I know the book has received alot of critical backlash but do not take it seriously. Just enjoy it~"
4,Not for the Faint Hearted,"The book was at times extremley gorry. Several scenes went from one extreme to the other - from hardcore porn to some of the most horrifying violence I have ever encountered. Much of the book is centered on the 1980's mentality and lifestyle - money, clothes, socializing, drugs etc.. It is well written and did keep my interest peaked - I finished it in one day, however, this is definitley not one for younger readers."
4,You have to appreciate vivid detail.,"Ellis has a flair for detail, and detail is how he writes. I understand critics claim American Psycho to be one of the worst books ever written, I found it highly engrossing as well, extremely disturbing. I will probably read it again"
4,"Misguided, typically American, and pretty darn good","Bret Easton Ellis recently read from his new book, Glamorama, in Trinity College and I realised, sadly, that to appreciate what he writes it must be read aloud (preferably by the author). I did enjoy reading American Psycho but the book had no lasting affect on me. Those lovely, long passages, stinging with venom, are a million times more potent when spoken by Ellis than by Bateman. Every American writer writes about one thing - America - this author does it very well - but how can mere characters compete when you are writing about such a staggering society? Oh and I was none too impressed with his stab on Bono - sounds like a case of pencil envy to me..."
3,Rubberneck read,"There is no doubt that this was a tough book to read. Many unsettling scenes. However, I could not stop reading, and whenever I thought that I had enough something even more surprising happened. I like this book for it's originality, and unabashed insanity. The endless descriptions of clothing and surroundings, gives me a clear cut vision of the character. I compare this book to my desire to stare at an automobile crash. You don't want to look, and you don't really want to see someone hurt. However, you're naturally driven to look to see if someone is hurt. I found this fascination with this book."
4,American Classic,"This is a classic book, I love it. The ways this guy kills his victims is so twisted, so wrong. That is is an instant classic. I rank this right up there with A Clockwork Orange and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. If you haven't read this book you should."
3,provacative,"This book did disturb me the first time I read it. I wanted to find Mr. Bateman and kill him. However, when a book provokes me this much, I call it success. It is satirical once you get past the absolute horror of what you're reading and it does have the effect of making you feel quite happy with your own semi-normal life. I would have to say that it reflects everyone's fascination with the perverse and the strange. This book is just a super-concentrated form of the violence we witness everyday. I think, in a strange way, it is poking fun at the reader. We are fascinated with violence; reading this proves it--Read it, and move on. You have to respect the Ellis' high-powered imagination. So, grab your Tums and enjoy!"
1,American Psycho equates to American Trash,"The review title says it all. This book blows. The only thing worse than this book is it's movie adaptation. Save your money and buy something worth while like ear wax, a pocket lint collection, or maybe even navel fuzz."
1,"Impactante,frío,muy duro,.....EXCELENTE.","Cruel definición de la sociedad clasista norteamericana.Donde el dinero,las ""marcas"",y el poder es lo único que importa. Además el sadismo descrito en los crímenes de Bateman es inigualable."
2,Overrated,"I was mocked when I told a couple of my coworkers that I hadn't seen the movie American Psycho. I found out there was a book so I decided to endure that first. Keyword, endure. Violence is naturally expected due to the title. In my opinion, 85% of the book is comedy. The other 15% is the meaningless violence. When the main character isn't eating his rape victims he's raving about music. In my honest opinion I think if I expected to read a comedy and not a so-called thriller then this review would have turned out a lot differently. Oh and by the way, I am not a fan of the movie either. For what it's worth, Christian Bale did play the hell out of the character."
1,Review on American Psycho,"Honestly, I was very disappointed in this book. I read it when it first came out years ago and it has now been revised to nothing more than porn. Very disappointing - Im sorry I wasted my money on it."
1,ridiculous,"Bret is just trying to shock people with American Psycho, IMO. His descriptions of the killings are extremely exagerrated and ovedone, but yeah, they're really sick and twisted and hard to read without getting a bad feeling in your stomach. The entire book consists of that, and the mentions of music and designer labels is way too redundant. This is not even worth your time."
3,Blue Balls,"This book had an amazing feel, charactors, and pacing. However, as the real problem lies in that there is no real plot to it. I kept on waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever did. This book is the literary equivelent of getting blue balls. Also, a lot of plot twists didn't make very much sense."
2,Makes me think twice about the death penalty,"I give author Ellis 1 star for fashion tips, and another star for his ability to use language skillfully. However, when I read a novel I try to appreciate the intent, skill, dialog, and PLOT. I finished this book and took a shower to clean the misogny from my memory. The main character spends his time spiraling into the disintegration of a personality that mirrors the crash and burn of American society. Ellis' lengthy descriptions of sex, gore and body parts fills me with loathing that I am actually reading this, especially the brutality against women and their fascinating and disposable sexual organs. I find myself skipping over redundant gore. It finally occurs to me that by drawing this reader to the end, Ellis makes me a partner in his literary degradation. At least I only wasted my money; Ellis has plundered his own talent."
1,"Flat out, the worst book I have ever read",I am not sure if it is the writing style or the content that places this book at the bottom of my reading experiences. It is a rare book that makes you feel cheated for having spent the time to suffer through it.
1,Pornography for psychotics.,"O.K., social commentary, blah-blah-blah. We know all of this already. Truth is, the experience of this book is exactly like having a warm handful of blood and hair thrown in your face. American Psycho seems to represent a new modality that is becoming evident in all forms of media--shock fiction, porno for psycho's. This book has some sick cathartic value, but hey, so does Jerry Springer. For my money, this work has all the art of a car accident--but I bet it still sells like crazy."
4,Disturbing but I loved it,"I'm on my second or third copy of this novel (they keep disappearing) and I think it is absolutely a hoot. It's extremely disturbing the first time you read it, but I recommend reading it more than once, just skip the gory parts if necessary. It is very New York with its extremely classist society and the ability of certain people to behave beyond the law. Did anyone else catch the overlap with the characters from Jay McInerney's _Story of My Life_? (Bateman runs into them at Nell's.)"
3,Dissapointed,"I loved Less Than Zero and love so called ""Grunge"" novels. So after all th hype I read the book and was sorely dissapointed, books can be evil and violent, and I enjoy them as long as they have beautiful prose the most violent book I ever read was Blood Meridian but the prose made it the most beautiful novel I had ever read. Walk past this in the bookstore one but borrow it off a friend it makes great conversation and confrontation"
5,"A gruesome, gory and gripping piece of American Reality","""American Psycho"" wonderfully challenges us (America) to look at ourselves in a truthful and new way. Americans are deluged with violence on T.V., in the newspapers, and in our schools. Though evil thoughts are as human as sexual desires, many of us tuck them neatly away for fear we act on them. Ellis shows us where capitalism and ostentatiousness become nearly as sickening as Bateman's other love. Reagan and Trump are the heroes of a class that stepped on the poor while making their way to opulent and indulgent lifestyles. We revile Bateman and his acquaintences long before Pat describes his bloodlust. Don't be afraid of the killing; be afraid of how many of us truly despise the less fortunate and love what we own. We need to read this book; it is a ""Modest Proposal"" and social satire for our age."
3,is ok,the first thing i did when i got my kindle was to buy this book because i liked very much the movie version...i liked the movie version better.it was a good story but very repetitous for my taste. some patience needed and i think i didnt have it at the time.
2,Never Again,"This book.....this horrible abortion of a book. American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis will give my nightmares but not in a good way. I've read some pretty horrible material over the past few years but nothing compares to this. I'm not talking about the murders, the horrible way he treats people and the homeless or even the blatant fascination with the material possessions around him. It's the sexual depravity that is shown throughout the murders of women. I want to scrub my brain clean.I grew to hate Patrick, really really hate him. I wanted so much for this book to end. Just to get through it was a chore. I understand his obsession with how people look and their status symbols. But to be constantly reminded over and over was just redundant. His description of clothes became mind numbing. At the beginning I understood it was mostly character development but it...kept....going. And the entire chapters on 80s music? I believe the spacing and editing could be a whole lot better."
1,horror at its worst,"I was unable to finish this book. Although I can be a fan of murder and madness novels, this was unbearable. the violence was extreme and the continous name- dropping of material wealth (ie. Gucci, Tumi, Expensive resturaunts) became boring. I am ashamed that I bought it. If you can finish it without throwing up, I would be surprised."
1,"No sense, no purpose.","It is not often that I will not finish a book particularily a book that was selected for our reading group. This book however,took only 120 pages to make me feel deeply repulsed and anxious. The references to designer fashions and home appliances were boring at best. After much hand wringing and soul searching I sent this book out with the recyclables. Perhaps it can be recreated into something with more substance."
1,More yuppie tripe,"Sorry to disagree with the concensus here, but this was a tiring novel. Tiring in the descriptions of everything from what the yuppie du'jour was wearing to gutting a sharpei. The entire time I read it I found myself asking, ""What else could I be reading right now?"" Sorry folks, this was sex and violence for the over(under?) stimulated. Just didn't care about Bateman and I really tried."
4,Food not for the Weak-Minded,"All I ever haer anymore is how the media and everything makes us do things. If you can't handle it do do it. If you don't like the book after the first couple of pages don't finish it. Cause all you do afterwards is complain. I enjoyed it, I thought it to be very funny and delightful in the gory area (especially the hamster trail-tube). But like I said before if you don't like it don't complain no one held a gun to your head and said, ""read this book, if you stop I'll kill you."" All it is is entertainment, see it for that because that is what it is."
4,A reflection of what we as a society have become...,"This novel may have contained portions of which almost inspired me to tears, but it nevertheless contained many of the stories we read about time and time again in the daily newspaper. American Psycho does not inspire violence towards groups such as women, but in my opinion the author wrote only about what time and time again happens when people perpetuate the legacy of hate towards those they do not understand. Our charismatic young killer is so immersed in his ideology and self that he possesses no sympathy for others. The only way for him to feel anything at all is for him to inflict pain upon others, yet it is never enough. In my humble opinion, this book is possibly an instant cultural classic, with which future generations can look back upon to get a small glimpse into our contrived and complex present."
2,Somebody owes me my time back!,"This was possible the first book I have ever wanted to stop reading. Not due to the content, but rather the lack of it! Ellis has to be one of the laziest authors of his time, this books reads like a copy of GQ with some reviews from Rolling Stone and a few pages from Penthouse thrown in to add some pages. I finished it only hoping at one point it would become a story with some sense of flow, but the book continued to be choppy and totally out of touch with anything that would make it seem realistic. If it weren't for the publisher giving up on it, I would have thought all the hype was created by the publisher just to sell an otherwise doomed book."
2,More a bad short story than a great novel,"American Psycho is one of those rare books that manages to be boring and repellent at the same time. Despite the gory detail, nothing happens. Admittedly, that may be the point of the book. If so, it hardly needed to be 400 pages long. Yes, it is rich in detail. It may even be an interesting commentary on the jaded, desensitized eighties. But the bottom line is that nothing changes thoughout the lifespan of the book. This may be all right for reality, but for fiction, it's just dull. I admit, however, the book has desensitized me to the extent that if Bret Easton Ellis is murdered by some twisted freak I will not care."
5,One of the best 10 books I've read in the last 10 years,"I was so seduced by the narrative I didn't realize until near the end the twist.....I actually thought Patrick Bateman was killing people in a perverted way. Wow, it was a relief when I figured it out. GREAT, GREAT book."
1,I want 3 wasted nights of my life back!,"I read this book when it first came out. Don't get me wrong, I love violence just as much as the next guy. That is, when it is presented by a writer with talent. I was not shocked by the violence in this book, just by how bad it was. I could have done a better time feeding my mind those three nights by watching television and drinking beer."
1,Hmm.......,I LOVE YOU BRETT EASTIN-ELLIS!! YOU ARE GOD!!!! HOW COULD YOU COME UP WITH SUCH SICK CHARACTERS? OH MY GOD!! YOUR TRULY AMAZING!!
4,MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND,"American Psycho has been criticized and praised, but mostly a lot of nonsense has been written about it. This is a powerful book, charting one man's isolation from the world and the absurdity of his environment. THe brilliance of some of the descriptions, the clarity of the prose as clothes hanging on soulless yuppies are punctiliously detailed, and the sheer anger of the writer make this an interesting and compulsive read. It is not a masterpiece, it is not a stupid work of titillation. It is an ambitious and striking novel. READ IT FOR YOURSELF."
2,Shocking yet perversely clever.,"The first time I read this book I found it shockingly appealing. I loved the way he dropped the names of designers and objects. I found it a very clever commentary on the lives of young, wealthy, beautiful people. However, I then tried to reread it and could not stand it. Not only that, the horror of it made me sick. I ended up throwing it away, where I thought no one could ever find it, as I would never want anyone else to read it. I cannot explain why I could read it the first time and had such a powerful reaction the second, but the second reaction stands the firmest. It is a horrifying, repugnant story. And I find no redeeming value in it. As one reviewer wrote, how has this story enriched anyone's life?"
2,"Oh, please...","This book was a nearly impossible read. The violence was not at all interesting or clever or smart--it was just bloody. There was no exploration of the psychology behind violence, or the linking of violence and sex and money and power. Now that might have been interesting. As it stands, my dropout junior high school boyfriend could have written this book."
2,Bad Reaction,"I have never reacted to a book in the manner that American Psycho caused me to. When I read that a book is being made into a movie, I usually try to read it. With Leo DeCaprio slated as the star and feminists stating their annoyance, I must admit that I was somewhat intrigued. Unfortunately, the joke was on me. I found the book to have a certain flair and difference, even though I was disgusted most of the way. I hated the non-ending, but with so many real crimes being unsolved I guess it was realistic. There were no characters to root for, but I finished it anyway. It became a faster read as I began to skim over the clothing descriptions. It was, however, a tedious read. I usually recommend books to my friends, but I cannot do that this time. I tore the book apart and shredded it. For some reason that gave me the closure that I missed at the end of the book."
2,Empty...,"Patrick Bateman's droning recitation of his chi-chi brand name possessions was amusing, as was his collection of tics and twitches and his hyper-shallow music reviews. But Ellis, as a writer, is about as subtle as his protagonist. It's one thing to suggest alienation, and another thing entirely to cram it down one's throat, like a chocolate-covered urinal cake"
1,American Puke,"This book popped up in my ""Recommendations"" list when I was ordering a Chuck Barris autobiography, a funny book by a funny man. I've read ""American Psycho"" (what parts didn't bore me), and it is neither funny or recommended for anybody with an IQ over 50. It's not a ""comment on society"" as some may suggest, and anyone who thinks that has potential to become a serial killer themselves. Society may be cruel, but not as cruel as the publishers of this crap."
2,What?,Way too much nonsense to keep this book flowing. Cut it down to 200 pages and you might have something.
1,THE WORST WASTE OF TIME AND PAPER,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. If you took out the descriptions of what everyone was wearing and the two chapters on contemporary singers i.e. Whitney Houston + 1, then the book would be two-thirds its size, being left only with gouging out eye balls and making reservations at night clubs. What a waste of time...I'm embarassed I read the whole thing. Hopefully I can spare you my mistake!"
1,Total Worthless Garbage,"After 42 years of reading in all genres, I've finally found a book that is total worthless garbage, never to re-read again, and will find no place on my shelves. While I have nothing against violence and gore, and reading about serial killers is in my top five list of books to read, this book simply stinks. Besides the characters, whom you cannot get into at all, the book jumps around and even includes reviews of various musicians! Several chapters are totally devoted to this. The book doesn't tell a good in-depth story, has no discernible plot, lousy characters, and ridiculous reviews which add nothing to the book. I'm sorry I wasted money and time on it. Save yours and read something much better and worth your time and money."
1,Wow.,"I have never rated a book before on Amazon, but I felt compelled to write one on this book because it bothered me so much. I gave the book one star because of the graphic violence. I understand this book is making a statement on the times, people, Ect. But it was really just too much for me.I am an avid reader who enjoys all sorts of genres of literature, and I understand that the author needed to paint a picture of a psychopath by showing us some of the killings. After awhile though the book becomes monotonous. If I have to read about what he is wearing and what other people are wearing, Music, and how he is torturing someone again, I think I will go Psychotic."
3,Who is the American Psycho?,"Amid the clamor of bright lights, designer names, the latest in stereophonic equipment, and the hottest new Manhattan clubs, Patrick Bateman swirls and tumbles into the abysmal depths of his mind, the depravity that it seems he and all of his clones on Wall Street are capable of. The monotony, the blandness of throwing around cash and Gold Cards is enough to drive anyone to execution.Midway through this book, stunned into uncaring by Ellis's repetitive style, boring like a drill into my skull, I was ready to tear the book into strips and go on a rampage. No wonder Bateman feels so compelled to maim and kill. His unrelentingly boring rich lifestyle demands it.Read this book if you want. Ignore the hype, and take the book for what it is, a commentary on excess and homogeneity, and one man's perhaps unguided efforts to bust out of his coffinlike existence."
1,What a mad world,This book drove me crazy. It filled me with disgust and horror. If life in New York relly is how he described it I can hardly believe how all those puppets live there.
2,blah blah boring,"Controversial? Shocking? Misunderstood? Boring is a little more accurate. The name brand clothing descriptions get real old real fast. The best parts are the critical theories on Genesis and Phil Collins. The movie is a little better. I like the part in the special 80's documentary on the DVD when the editor of Film Comment is interviewed and says about the book, ""It's just not that good"". Hah!.If you're into this ""genre"", whatever it is, check out Hubert Selby's ""The Demon""."
2,Yawn. Author is getting more tedious by the book,"Bret Easton Ellis seems to be a victim of literary arrested development. Since his seemingly self-pitying first novel, ""Less Than Zero"" his twin adolescent themes seem to be:1) Look at how debauched and shocking I can be and2) Poor me and my over affluent contemporaries -- We got too much too soon and now we're warped sociopaths.This was tedious when penned by a 23 year-old, but now that he has pushed this subtext for almost 20 years, you sort of wish that he would grow up a bit. That said, I haven't yet read his latest, ""Lunar Park"" and maybe he has progressed some."
1,UGH!,"I started reading this a few years ago, and promptly returned it after just 50 pages. This book stands out in my memory as one of the worst books I've ever experienced. Want to read a page of ramblings about the thread count of a designer shirt? Or tolerate the unbearably repetitive use of the word ""hardbodies""?I was put-off not only by the writing style, but the violent scenes. I expected violence, but the scenes just made no sense! They just hung in mid-air, waiting for better context. This is a useless,immature, overhyped embarrassment, and I can't believe someone has written a literary guide for this book. It's like providing Cliffs Notes for a high school student's creative writing project. The praise for this book astounds me. Couldn't put it down? I think I threw my copy across my desk in disgust!"
4,A book you won't forget,"This book will make your skin crawl. But it will also make you stop and think. Personally I don't believe Ellis intended it to target just the yuppies of the 1980's. I believe the point is a serial killer could be anyone you know. The descriptions of Bateman and his cronies are very much the same. Bateman is exactly like everyone else. As a matter of fact throughout the entire book he is mistakenly identified as other yuppie men. Likewise, his buddies are always arguing as to who is sitting at the end of the bar.I think this book should definitely be read by people now. Look around you and you will find people obsessively trying to get more and more of everything. When is it enough? And when it's enough, then what? I think that is the point.Read if you dare, but be warned there are certainly scenes that will make you cringe."
2,like rubbernecking,"If you've ever driven by a horrible car accident and couldn't help but look, you'll know what reading this book is like. It's shock-value scenes are deployed for mere fascination, nothing else. The man character, Patrick Bateman, is wholly unidentifiable as anything close to a member of the animal kingdom, pathologic or not. Mr. Ellis refuses to give any substance or insight into his character, but instead exploits our perceptions of evil and godlessness to spin a useless tale of depravity. No insight, resolution or explanations, only bewildering implausabilities which make us wonder ""why bother?"""
3,Do you like Phil Collins?,"I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual.Seriously though, this book was so disturbing that I got rid of it after I finished reading it. The movie is satire and enjoyable as such, but the book is dark and horrible. It will take you to a bad place that you won't forget for the rest of your life; if that's your idea of a good book, then buy it. Otherwise, run. Just run."
5,One of Ellis' best.,"If you have never read any of Ellis' work, it is better to start with his earlier fiction (Less Than Zero, Rules of Attraction) and definitely American Psycho. It's dark, witty, VIOLENT and SEXUALLY EXPLICIT but it's entertaining from beginning to end."
2,Psycho?,Well-I couldn't wait to finish this book -so I could read something better! Read this book if you like long reviews on the music of Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis. Or if you are interested in reading pages and pages of descriptions of men's clothing and who makes the best suits and is it OK to wear argyle socks. Or maybe read it to discover all sorts of weird recipe descriptions served in trendy bistros. It's all about the clothes and food. Throw in some depraved sex and lots of blood and gore and you have an uninteresting mish-mash.
3,"Very compelling, but not what I would call enjoyable","It is interesting and creative but also very revolting and I felt physically ill a few times. Very unrealistic as to the extent the main character goes with his vicious and morbid acts. If the events happening here were really happening in NY city, he would never have been able to not be caught I don't think. I was compelled to read it to the end to find out what happens. I felt cheated. All of the designer name dropping gets old quick (and I am interested in fashion). Patrick bateman is also the most vain person I think I could ever read about.It might be a good read for the thicker skinned people of the world if you do not take it very seriously."
5,Read after seeing the movie,I saw the movie first. The book is much deeper and more depraved than the movie. Watching the movie you can see all the subtle mentions of things left out of the movie.
3,pretty crazy,"I watched the movie and liked it so I decide dto give this a try. Its pretty neurotic just reading it, and I""m sure that's what the author was going for but...when I say its neurotic reading it...trust me when I say it is neurotic reading it. just makes you feel like Bateman...and it isn't all that fun"
1,Fantastic Fantasy,"Every fantasy readers fantasy. To be sweapt from this old boring world to another fantasy world filled with powers, beautiful women and a great war against evil powers too terrible to behold.By taking men of our world and placing them into a fantastic world puts the reader in the box seat of all his/her escapist fantacies.Well worth the read. Unfortunately out of print, and needs and third book that was never written!"
3,Good product,This is going to very helpful for me to start my new hobbie. Thank you so much for this amazing book!
5,Exactly what I needed :),"I ordered this book because I'm currently deployed and planning to surprise my husband when I come home by learning how to play while I'm gone (he plays guitar). This book has absolutely everything I'll need to teach myself :) Great book, highly recommend it!"
2,"Poor printed, bad vision impression","Contents squeeze together, no colorful pictures, very few music for practices. Many topics are only redundant description with no examples. This book is not suitable for beginners."
3,Guitar,The guide is not as simple as I thought. You do need to have some idea of how to play a guitar if you are going to use this guide.
1,Why did I buy this?,"Seriously, it sucks went to the music store and bought a better one that was cheaper."
4,well rounded,i like the order of the lessons. switches from chords to reading music then back to chords... so as not to be monotonous.good beginners book.
3,It's Okay,"I found this easy to read and understand but I don't like the way the book is set up. You learn a few notes and then move onto chords. I would have preferred to learn all the notes and then move onto chords because that seems much simpler to me. But you can skip through the book to find the other notes.I also thought there should be more songs to practice with when learning the notes, there were only rwo or three tiny little bits after learning the notes.All in all it was just adequate for me."
3,Not what i thought it was,"I thought this book was tabs and more present songs to this day, but it turned out to be chords and older songs im not interested in. So this is not a bad review, I just didn't take any interest in it. Been sitting on my shelf since the day i got it."
3,guitar book,"This is a pretty good book. My only complaint is that it was not that great for truly rank beginners. if you have some foundation this book will work well, but if you truly know nothing about guitar i would recommend Jam Along Series."
5,Excellent,"I purchased the book and everything was in good order and on time, thank you seller.The product itself is wonderful, very succinct and educational. I am a novice so the exercises are certainly not easy but definitely worth learning."
4,Good,We all like it. Both my 8-yr daughter and 3-yr son enjoyed a lot. We got this in the summer but they are not tired of watching them yet.
3,Dinotopia - The Series,"Hallmark's Dinotopia, the series is reasonably entertaining for the whole family and the current price warrants consideration. The story is about a father and his two sons flying over the ocean in their small private plane when they hit a storm and crash. They end up on a beach but on an Island that isn't on any known map. When they find people they are considered guests and treated well. All seems relatively normal until they see Dinosaurs, some which can talk. The rest the series revolves around the boys becoming active in the Dinotopian society by getting an education and taking on responsibilites such as raising a dinosaur and flying on one. I was not overly impressed the first time I saw half the miniseries but on my second viewing I actually enjoyed it. I recommend the ""Dinotopia - The Miniseries"" and the ""Dinotopia - The Series"". Good quality DVD with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""The Golden Compass"" and ""Earthsea"".CA Luster"
4,Good series - too bad ended so soon,"The Dinotopia series just started and was cancelled within a few weeks. Too bad, it was a good series for the family. I purchased the set to see the episodes that were never shown. Many of these were better than the first few.This is a good buy for someone who wants a few hours of enjoyable family entertainment."
1,not subtitled/closed-captioned,Do not buy if hearing impaired. Cheap people who made the DVD did not subtitle or close-caption. Saw original show on TV and it was captioned.
4,Nice lineup but there's one missing,"It's a damn shame the one band that could have made this album a real classic was left off. Slobberbone's the band. How could it have happened? However, the soundtrack doesn't lack diversity; it could just use some strengthening."
4,Fat On Talent,"It was a great surprise to find this CD at the store the other day. If you like the ""real country blues"", not the slick, overproduced Chicago stuff, then this is for you. The Fat Possom folks, Kimbrough, R.L., etc. are great. Interesting to have Tom Waits, Tom Verlaine and Steve Earle on this too. They do a great job too. Verlaine is moody and mystical and just great on the two instramentals.I dont know if the movie will be worth anything, but the sound track is certainly worth the price. Buy this and you will not be dissapointed if you are a blues fan, or a fan of real music.You may even want to do a little work and find out more about the great Jr. Kimbrough, R. L.Burnside, Asier Payton, or any of the other non-mainstream blues greats featured here. Well worth the effort."
4,Great Southern Blues,"This soundtrack is definitely a recommendation for someone who hasn't fully come to appreciate the South's blues era. Although most of the tracks are modern blues, they still have the essence of what the Deep South is and was back in the early 20th century. This cd is great for young indie fans looking for something new and different, and also for middle-aged music lovers that want something new other than their John Mayell and Eric Claptom blues."
4,This is the Wu HAO style,"The Sun style was derived from the Wu Hao style and they are both very similar. So, no, this isn't the Wu style. The presentation and instruction is quite clear from a visual perspective although the english subtitles aren't always good translations."
5,Gorgeous!,"This is a very handsome set on my countertop. The tools are very well-made and have exceptionally comfortable and sturdy handles. My favorites are the omelet turner and the ball whisk, which makes whipping up gravy on the stove a breeze. The little hooks on the exterior of the basket canister are very useful for a peeler, measuring spoons, etc.. Happy with this set. Kudos to WMF."
4,Nice caddy!,"nice and stable caddy. I like the nonstick set too. but the holes of the caddy is a little bit too large, it cannot hold chopsticks."
2,Nice design poor materials,Design and feel in hands was very nice. Good weight and a nice solid stiff feel makes it easy to control. My 2stars is only because the spatula has a weak spot in the middle of the nylon and ended up breaking after only a couple months. The nylon feels very stiff but brittle anything other than easy lifting such as stuck in fried food will likely cause it to break.
2,Ain`t She Sweet,"I love to hear Annette Hanshaw sing. I bought two other CD`S at the same time, It Was So Beautiful and Annette Hanshaw Volume six 1929. The sound quility was great. I understand recordings are not like todays recordings. The engineers did a good job in the transfer from 78`s to digital. But the soundquility on this CD is just not good. It sounds like they tried to enhance the vocal too much. It lost much of vocal quility of Miss Hanshaw`s voice. Great songs but the quility is just not good. I really like Sensational Classic Jazz series. It sounds as natural as you can get it from these very old recoriding."
1,Painfully tedious for experienced SEs,"As a software engineer for over twenty years, this book was definitely not for me. I have to agree with other reviewers - the lack of references to more current SW PM practices is deporable. The scope of Project Manager for Software is much larger than this book and the example used does not measure up. The integration with the PMBOK and the integration of SEI SW-CMM into Project Management for software was not discussed. I was looking for a higher-level writing of PM, not for looking at VB code - what was that? Look elsewhere if you want a higher-level discussion of real-world software PM."
2,An interesting book but . . . .,"Seeing a project develop from start to finish makes for interesting reading, but it also makes the book a giant case study. I was hoping for a general overview of project management (I have a computer science degree with no background in management) but the book really doesn't provide it. I found the case study to be overly detailed and I skipped over most of it, allowing me to read the book in a few hours. The last chapter, which contains a summary of the main concepts, is probably the most useful part."
2,Getting lost in the techno-speak,"I have thoroughly enjoyed Fred Alan Wolf's other books, yet this one is not one I would recommend. Dr Wolf goes off a bit too much on an academic journey in attempt to lay a foundation that proves the human soul exists. I would suggest one does not need to trace back all theoretical philosophical treatise on the subject in order to prove that the human mind is separate and distinct from the human brain, and the soul of a person is yet again distinct from both of those entities. One only has to see the smile of a child when first discovering a puppy or remember back to the first time you kissed you first true love to prove the soul exits... This becomes too academic and technical for even the most advanced spiritual reader to get much value. Sorry, Dr. Wolf, but I think you missed the boat on this one."
2,Please be cautious...,"If you are curious about quantum physics, read books by Werner Heisenberg or Max Born or David Bohm. I you are curious about relativity, read books by Albert Einstein or Max Born or Hans Reichenbach or Wolfgang Pauli. Read books by Richard Feynman. A great source for these is the Dover books catalog.Learn about these topics from the masters. These ""pop-physics"" books have a certain appeal, but be careful about speculations and the combination of science with spirituality. It can be entertaining to read these books, but keep a healthy skepticism."
1,How Many Angels Dance on the Head of a Pin?,"The arrogance of many theoretical physicists is that experiments don't matter: The arrogance is that they know philosophy better than philosophers. Modern Philosophy knows God cannot be proven theoretically. And science requires experimental proof. Faith is debased by self-affirming delusions of proof, no matter how eloquent the author, and Dr. Wolf is very eloquent. And science is debased by being misconstrued and marginalized. (Why spoil a good idea with the empirical evidence!) Faith has NO logical proof and needs NO scientific evidence. As Stephen Jay Gould has said: Religion and Science are Non-Overlapping Magisteria (NOMA). One cannot measure one with the other."
3,Wolf does it again,"Fred Alan Wolf has brought his far out ideas down to earth again for the general audience. The Spiritual Universe is a worthwhile read showing a good comparison to historical spiritual mysticism and physics. The connections between the soul and quantum phenomena are a bit simplistic and must be taken by faith. Yet, the implications of his are ideas are staggering."
1,Difficult,"I found this book very difficult to read. The subject matter is part of the problem, but the author kept saying he would come back to this or that at a later time which tended to get me a bit lost. I also never was real clear in any specific way about the connections between quantum physics and the spiritual world."
1,Dr. Wolf's shot at the soul,"I was disappointed in this book. After reading most of Dr. Wolf's other works, I found this one wondering and burdensome. Although writing about a proof of the human soul is no lite matter, I would like to have seen a more imagineable work. I didn't need the copious amount of historical thought about the soul...I wanted to know more ""straight forward"" what Fred thought about the topic. Not being a phsicist or educated in deep theoretical thinking, I wasn't able to grasp a lot of the concepts presented (trouble I haven't had with Dr. Wolf's other works).I admire anyone who would tackle this task, but I didn't find the work one of his better efforts."
2,Not the quality I was looking for!,"I have always purchased HP printers, this is not up to the same quality or standard. I eventually gave up and went out to get anotherHP. If your used to quality buy an HP. If your desparate still buy an HP."
5,Design and Function,"This bottle stopper not only has a beautiful design, it also fits tightly on the bottle thanks to the silicon ring. It's an elegant addition to the dinner table."
1,Bits & pieces from here to there ...,"To say that I really couldn't get into the book would be an understatement. The book deals primarily with a married couple, Miranda and Nick and their current day travails in handling an open marriage...The concept of sweet revenge just kind of floats out there and even with Miranda putting it out to everyone she ever met, male and female, I never really got the idea of sweet revenge .... I knda thought the title should have been Coming of Age for Miranda ....The sex scenes aren't great or creative either ... sorry I'll pass on this one"
5,Bus full of Memories,When I saw this book it immediately caught my attention. Opening it brought back all the memories I had of as a little girl joining my mother and my Nana on our yearly trips to Boston. This is one book that is a must for my collection and my family's recollection. 8)
3,OK Coffee Pot,"We had previously used the Texsport 10 cup pot and it is well made and sturdy. Needed more capacity. This makes 14 cups fine, but it is not as substantial and the pot is either slightly warped or out of round as it is difficult to get the basket for the coffee grounds inserted. Other than that, it is just a coffee pot."
2,Decent,"I was a bit disappointed with the overall quality considering it was a 30+ dollar coffee pot. Straight out of the box, the ""top handle connector"" was not welded on one side, and we had to weld it back on, and the lid connection is a bit flimsy."
4,Nice Pot,"Nice but the basket could be a little bigger to handle 14 cups. I like the pot, and I tried many ways, but couldn't find a way to keep the grounds in the basket. I think if it was deeper it would help."
3,Coffee cup size,"I ordered a coffee pot that was supposed to brew 14 cups of coffee but you cannot get more than 8-9 cups of water into the pot. The coffee it brews is excellent but I need a larger capacity than the one that was advertised. But, I cannot afford another one so I guess I'll have to live with what I got. As one can see, the Texsport Stainless Steel 14 cup percolator cannot brew 14 cups unless the cups are small. Thank you, JNShick"
1,14 Cup Texport stainless percolator: Leaks out of the bottom seam.,14 Cup texport stainless percolator: Missing parts. Finally got parts from Amazon. If you call the maker company they do not respond. They say Charles the parts guy is in a meeting or at training...blaa blaaa blaaaa. Lies lies and more lies. Then we went camping and it leaked out the bottom after the first use over a campfire. Sent it back for a full refund by Amazon. Lot of work for myself and Amazon. Piece of junk.
5,Excellent Kit,"Pros: easy assembly and disassemble with the a tool provided. Great selection of molecules, good amount of carbon for organic chem. but could do with 10 or so more."
5,very good buy!!,"This has been a great buy. I am a chemistry student and needed to see visually the molecular shapes. It has helped so much, and the best part is it has pieces to make octahedrals, tetrahedrals and all the other ones. This kit will be a huge must for any chemistry student in need of visuals to better understand concepts."
4,Chem model kit review,"Very helpful model kit, not necessarily ideal for biochem as there are not enough individual atoms but very helpful with orientation etc."
5,Excellent!!!!,"I have an older 150m model purchased in 1970. I like the older model, wore it and used it for diving. It was comfortable, even though it was heavy. Only problem was that it did not keep good time.The new one keeps time very, very accurately!!! I have not reset it in over a month, it is still spot on. Dove with it this weekend and love the fact that like the old one it is very easy to read. My eyes are not what they once were, but no problem reading the Seiko.I wanted a watch that would not require batteries. I would sure like to know what they did to improve it's time keeping ability. This is an excellent watch for SCUBA divers. And, for the price ... why look at anything else."
5,"excellent watch, excellent buying experience","i have bought this watch for my son whom graduated the naval commander course and chose this model. the watch came in perfect shape, quickly and is excellent.the buying experience was very good. my son is happy - so i'm too.few month had passed (it's Jan' 2010) and the watch has stoped and wouldnt go. i've taken it to be checked and the watchmaker told me that these automatic mechanizm is problematic, inaccurate and tends to break down"
4,Durable,"I have had one of these since 1999. Bought it in Fiji for $100.00. It is very tough and durable, good dive watch. I rolled a go kart in Thailand and the only thing that saved my wrist from being torn up was the rubber wristband. My other wrist wasn't so lucky, so I have a big scar on one wrist and a chunk of rubber missing from the strap. It runs a little fast but overall it I am very happy with it. Most self winders with a date tend to run fast. Good travel watch, not flashy which I prefer when abroad. At this price point it's hard to beat."
2,Poor performance and construction,I've had this watch for over four years.It has constantly run fast. I need to adjustit every week. The stainless steel bracelet also came apart on one sidewhere it connects to the timepiece.It is good looking and I get some compiments on it butoverall I'm unhappy with its performance and construction.
2,"Uh, warranty card?","I believe this to be a grey market version of the SKX009. It appears authentic but was missing a warranty card. I didn't notice until 30 days after receiving it. It has a rattle when I shake it and I was going to return it for warranty repair but when I went to check the box it came with, there is no warranty card which Seiko requires for repair without charge. I'm disappointed, Amazon."
5,Emmet Fox it's an amazing author,"I have learned a lot of spiritual concepts thru this and all Emmet Fox books. I strongly recommend this lectures, if you want to learn and get closer to God. It doesnt matter what religion you are, God have no religion, the only thing that really matter its your relationship with Him."
1,New Age Bull,I know this is suppose to be a really good book for giving a person some so called positive outlook on life. New Age material doesn't work.
3,Missing link,"Shai finally came back after a couple years off and I was a little dissapointed with the results. After they set the standard for R&B With ""If I ever fall in love"" they have Gone through lots of changes. I feel this album is lacking the style that was shai for their first three albums. The music is good and there is a catchy song or two but overall they are missing something. My guess is it's Carl Martin. What ever happend to the fourth member of shai?. My suggestion. If you love shai get it. If you want to experience shai go back into time and start with if I ever fall in love. Mike Simonsen"
1,Carl Martin is deeply missed,"Shai had a impact in the early 90's that we are still felt by, to this day. I believe that the album DESTINY is a failure because there are four members in the group, not three. Every member ads something special. Carl Martin is the missing member. All the Shai members are talented. Will Shai get one more chance? I think all the members need to come as one and give us something new that we can feel before it's to late. Shai's old music and soul will always last till the end of time."
5,When Mercedes was still a Teutonic Car,"Excellent book. These are the quintessential Mercedes Benz automobiles. The photographs have that ""Cold War"" vibe to them, and the cars themselves look slightly sinister. Check out page 42 where the women is offering a cigarette to the man hiding in the trunk of the Benz. Perhaps she is smuggling him out of East Berlin? And the nurse on page 76; is she the Western medic who looks after an Eastern spy who defected to the West? Of so, lucky guy !! All in all, the photos of these cars capture the true essense of what Mercedes Benz automobiles are SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE. Unlike the cars the company now sells, which are merely glitzy ""Bling-Mobiles"" for people with more money than good taste."
4,Best quality CD produced of the band's pre-Capitol sessions.,"In its wisdom, RCA bought Elvis' original Sun recordings -- masters, alternates, outtakes, etc. and compiled them on the SUN SESSIONS CD. Likewise, the greatest American pop band has this offering, in two different sets of artwork. Tho' the group photo cover is shown above, it's inaccurate by about two years and the absence of guitarist David Marks. The material consists of early versions, working demos, & final masters of the dozen or so songs the young Beach Boys record- ed with Hite & Dorinda Morgan, publishers/producers. This is an historical CD, and not really meant to be put on at a party (try the PARTY! or 20/20 or SUMMER IN PARADISE CDs for that). It's also an excellent insight for young musicians to see how teenagers can put together demos, which in this case, impressed Capitol Records enough for a contract."
4,Good backup light,This makes a good backup light during a power failure since it is battery powered. I just wish it was a little brighter then it is but it still does the job. I would recommend this light for campers or people that live in areas where there is a chance for a power failure.
2,Not quite a d20 book,"I really wanted to like this book, I really did. However, the ad copy and what the book is capable of are two completely different things. This book does not entirely break down d20, in fact the section on such rules is almost an after thought. Those experienced with the d20 system will be surprised to find mechanics that are completely different from those you are familiar with... most with no explination for the changes. The combat system causes the biggest ""what the heck?"" moment. It is wildly different from normal d20. What is worse is that it feels relatively obvious that it was written by someone with a poor understanding of the d20 dynamics. As such, this book can hardly be plugged straight into any d20 setting like it claims.Now, it does have some good parts, and those familiar with Tri-Stat might like its spin on the d20 mechanics. However, those looking for an addition to a current or existing campaign should look elsewhere."
3,An okay gangster movie,"The movie itself is like many other gangster flicks, not a shining star but still worth watching when I am board."
5,idk what that guy's problem was...,"Green gas is green gas. this particular brand is the one i've been using since i started competing at tournaments and i've had no complaints so far. if you are using a green gas pistol, it is a good idea to have this handy as well as some silicon lube from your local hardware store (look in the automotive aisle for dupont, liquid wrench, or wd40's specialist if you can justify the 4 dollar difference in the ""smart"" tube) to lube up the slide and the internals. green gas may expel from every opening in the gun when you fire (especially blowback pistols) but its just a good idea to keep the gun in top condition.Excellent product, it won't give you grief.the guy who reviewed this item before me obviously didn't know what he was buying."
1,http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006N07V8/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title,its gas it a rip off and for the money I would convert my gun to compressed air or co2 other wise its jut gas and it cost too much
5,Relax........,"This is the reissue of the 1985 single ""Relax"" by England's finest none other then ""Frankie Goes To Hollywood"". The single has 5 tracks on it. The first 4 are all remixes of the classic new-wave song. But track 5 happens to be the 7 minute version. If you ever owned the 12 inch single of ""Relax"", it's on here. Not the 3 minute version that they played on the radio to death. Nope, your only going to find 4 remixes and the original 12 inch single (which happens to be better then the radio version). Get this only for the 12 inch single, if not buy the 1985 LP ""Welcome To Pleasuredome"" (that's only if you want the radio version of Relax). This is a must have for FGH fans. Track 5 the 12 inch single just rocks. Buy this also if your a big 80's fan."
2,Eh...,"Just not what I was looking for. Guess I was looking for a simple radio version.? I'm not a huge 80's new wave music person and just wanted the song to ""Relax"" with once in a while. This CD has five extended versions, each mixed a bit differently and if you're into that you may like it better. I purchased it after reading good reviews, so what do I know..."
2,Disappointing,"Goodness, it hurts me to post this one because this is one of my favorite songs of all time, but this CD is more than a bit disappointing. I feel this way mostly because it doesn't have the original track or radio version of the song on it. It has a ton of remixes that, for all intents and purposes, aren't too bad, but just aren't what I was expecting. They have some pretty nice ""latin/club"" style rhythms & synths, but were a little TOO much on the ""club-style"" theme. The original song had a nice, strong, solid rhythm and bass-line. The stuff on here is more techno.Depending on what you're into, some may like it. I was hoping for the original track with some new re-mixes. In this case, 1 out of 2 is bad."
3,Single Frankie Goes to Hollywood,This is not the single I thought it would be. Most of the songs are instrumental. I wanted the RELAX to be done differenly four times.But the CD came fast and I was happy with my service. Thank you.
5,Oh my... what a great love story!,"This was such an excellent, sweet romance... I loved it! I had to chuckle out loud more than once. DR really knows how to write a good storyline, good humor, good romance, & EXCELLENT love scenes! lol Gracie was just too sweet & funny, & Adam was to die for! They were 2 that I just couldn't wait for them to realize they were in love & live happily ever after. Zoey kind of started getting on my nerves, but bless her heart she KNEW she had screwed-up & was doing her best to dig herself out of it. I'll definitely be looking for more books by this author."
4,PERFECT!,"I gave this book to Jennifer Wong, a friend of mine from sekolah pelita harapan on her birthday, and she loved it. She is obsessed with romantic stories and she said that this is the best book she has ever read."
5,This cd is worth it!!,"This cd has quite a few long tracks....I mean nearing 20 minutes long. That's what makes it so dope. Can't say that there is one track on this Cd that I would be willing to skip. Pick it up, pick it up!"
3,Studio Lotus,"About par for the coarse when it comes to an electrifying band in the live setting churning out a studio album. Good music on this album, but if you want the real wow factor, go see them live."
1,Extremely Disappointed!!,"I just received the Sabatier Grand Chef knife set and my experience is almost identical to the one described by Joseph of Macomb, MI. Every knife handle was scratched and beat up and the set looked used. The sharpening steel was from a different knife set and was too large to fit into the block. The block was very poor quality and different than the one shown here and on the box I received the set in. I will be returning these knives tomorrow and since I'm the second person in a month reporting this problem, I strongly recommend that you do not order this item."
4,Great value in almost all respects,"This was a great bargain on the six French knives. Contrary to some of the other reviewers, my husband and I even like the Chinese-made mezzaluna. We've been doing the low-carb thing of substituting shredded cauliflower for rice, and the mezzaluna in a wooden bowl is as good as a food processor -- if you don't happen to have a food processor handy. The slots in the knife block don't fit the knives, especially the largest knife. As for the sharpening steel, I've never understood those anyway. So: take the knives and be happy. Bon appetit!"
3,The little things mean a lot,"When I got these knives, I was surprised to see that the blades had nicks in the cutting edge. It looks like they sharpen the knives and then drop them into a bin. I was able to resharpen the knives and remove all but the deepest nicks. The knife block is oak, and is very nice. The knives have a nice feel and balance. I just think a little more attention to the fit and finish of the knives, would be greatly appreciated."
1,this listing is as lame as lame can be,"I don't need to know about what the **** other brands are associated with Cooper tools, I WANNA KNOW WHAT BITS AND SIZES ARE IN THE KIT!!!!!! well, after I surf the web a bit I'll have a clue about this particular tool (set).I've owned and used Xcelite 99s for 40 years.Cooper has gone offshore with most of their stuff, so the quality is now a crapshoot. I'll only buy replacement blades unless I know a specific tool is US made, waranteed and top quality. Remember, if it's made in China, the people that made it are only paid 1% to 5% of what we get here in the US, so you shouldn't pay more than 1% - 5% of the price you'd pay for made in USA tools!"
3,nice songs but...,"Many of the people who gave this album 3 stars or less bought the album not understanding that Another Late Night is a series of downtempo mixes by prominent downtempo artists and DJs. You can imagine the disappointment when they discovered this was not original Zero 7 material, but just a compilation of songs that have inspired the artists behind ""Simple Things."" As for myself, I am disappointed in this compilation because I expected Zero 7 to get more creative with the mix instead of just playing the songs one by one. There is very little mixing in the way of layering tracks on top of each other, actual beat mixing or adding effects or scratching. That said, Zero 7 is responsible for very little here and I hope they aren't banking off of this too much. In the end, all you have are the individual tracks, most of which are quite good, such as the contribution by Cinematic Orchestra and Slum Village."
3,All but what?,"This collection of sound is all but wonderful. It is a confusing but pleasant array of music but what the pieces have to do with Zero 7's genre of music, I don't have a clue.Don't buy this collection if want Zero 7's style, because it ain't happen' here."
3,I've been had...,"When I ordered this CD I was under the impression that there would actually be Zero 7 songs on it, not just songs that they happen to like. The cover art and the liner notes are very misleading, never clearly stating that this is simply a *compilation* CD. When you look at the fine print on the back of the CD you see that Zero 7 actually only mixes one song...which is quite good...actually the whole album is pretty good, but not what I ordered...hmmm."
4,"WARNING, not Zero 7","I read the last several reviews here and I wanted to let those folks know out there that this is not a studio album of Zero 7. This is an album of their favorite songs which they have remixed. If you are new to Zero 7, you probably dont want to buy this album, but buy one of their studio albums like ""When it falls."" If you know Zero 7's work, you may enjoy the odd and downtimepo remixes."
2,mr. tegu,"While the music in itself is fine, it is not what I was expecting. As has been suggested, fans of zero 7 should not blindly drop their hard-earned cash down for this one. It is NOTHING like their first and third albums. If you're a fan of hip-hop, you may really enjoy this album. However, I am disappointed that I did not listen to the samples. I would've realized that this album was not for me."
4,People Are Idiots,"Simple Things is on of the coolest albums to come out in a while and Zero 7 certainly take you on a wonderful ride. Another Late Night is a CD of a much different type and purpose. The CD is great in it's own right because it stands firmly as a compilation and gives an insight into what inspired Zero 7.Any idiot who thought this was a new disc by Zero 7 and bashes it accordingly because it is not, well...why read a review by someone who can't even read a CD's description before purchasing it.This is Mellow, Classic stuff...for the refined ear."
3,A little jumbled with some highlights perhaps worth it.,"After hearing Rae and Christian's Another Late Night, I really had to hear more of the series (DJ Dan, Zero 7, Groove Armada), so I picked this CD up. Amazon had also recommended Zero 7 to me independantly.It started out innocently enough, with some loungey jazzy beats and ambient mood to it. The record rapidly turned, however, within three tracks, to a meta-rap deluge over mild and meek beats.After another couple tracks, the rap thinned out some, and it was replaced with some more upbeat, electronic jazz tones. I think that about half way through is really the highlight of the album. Bright and melodic, but still downtempo enough to be a relaxing listen.Shortly thereafter, however, the record makes a foray back into the hard rap-over-quiet-music genre.Thankfully, the album finishes on a brighter note, and for about four tracks, the album is worth listening to.I don't regret buying the album; I simply wish it had more substance to it. Buy used."
2,I like the Zero 7 song but....,"Yeah the Zero 7 track is a cover of the Jamaican Studio One artist Jonny Osbourne, ""Truth and Rights"". They have dubbed it out quite a bit. It is an incredible song on its own. I would buy this record just for that track but that is me. The original is on a recent Studio One Compilation. I love that track. Well if you have seen Zero 7 live then you have probably heard the track. They do a great cover with Moses singing it from the bottom of his soul. I couldnt have asked them for a more incredible song to cover, but then again I have spent over a decade digging through piles of obscure reggae albums. Well there are some good tracks on this disc but I was turned off by the hip hop tracks. I guess I heard them and was like Yuck!! I am not into hip hop much, although there are exceptions, ie Lyrics Borne. Cinematic Orchestra, Da Lata are great but maybe a different ""another late night"" selection would be wiser. Hold out for more seven........."
4,Another Great Night,"This is another great cd amongst this new compilation series. I rarely rate anything, however i feel i must air my view to Simon L's comments who feels he has been duped. Dude if you check the back you would have known this was a compilation rather than another Zero 7 cd. The fact that there is only 1 Zero 7 track is a bonus, thus enabling us to actually track their inspiration, rather than some other compilations that are compiled to promote the compilers music. The lack of flow amongst the genres is another bonus, so we are exposed to different music and expand our horizons - and thats what miscic means to me.I highly recommend you go and purchase this cd as well as the rest of the other cd's in the series.I also recommend purchasing Marvin Gaye's 'Troubleman' - a cd to live by."
2,"I was TRICKED! ,,,,,THIS IS A COMPILATION!","I am very confused about this realease. I was so excited when I put it in the player for the first time, only to be suprised by what came across the speakers. I loved Simple THings like a religion, but I just could not get into this COMPILATION ALBUM. Dont be fooled like I was and just wait for the next TRUE Zero 7 release to spend your $$ on."
1,Bad Buy,"I was really expecting a different type of album, but unfortunately I got a mix of jazz-type music, with a some weird rap. Had I wanted to buy that kind of album I would have bought something from the Hip Hop Section, at least then I would have known what I was getting into."
2,Generic,"I have not bought the album yet but from the samples I heard on this website, I think the album sounds a bit generic. Also, now that all the confusion about the album has settled, can someone please atleast give us a review of the Zero 7 track on the album?"
2,Didn't work for me.,"I tried this at my doctor's recommendation to attempt to increase seratonin levels to assist with sleep more naturally. I've finished one bottle, following the directions on the label, and have had no results as indicated would possibly happen. It didn't work for me."
4,Nice album,"I really enjoyed listening to these songs, the Caesars have made a good work, actually I'm used to listening to the Caesars every morning to wake up. I've recently heard in a movie a song which rang a bell, I thought at The Caesars but I'm not sure so here is an url in which you may hear a sampler of that song : http://thrawn.suidzer0.org/Song.mp3. I'd like you to tell me if it's a The Caesars's song or not and if you can, tell me the title. Thanks"
5,Gold standard of Ketchup!!,"This is the king of ketchup, known far and wide over the whole world, and in many fast food resteraunts. This is a multi-purpose food enhancer, that can be used of fries, hash browns, steak, ham, sausage, burgers, hot dogs, brats. It goes with almost everything. A great bottle to keep in your fridge. There is a reason this is known worldwide, because it's consistent, reliable, and good."
5,My dogs favorite treat!!!,"Even though I don't buy Pedigree food to feed my dogs, I do buy these treats for them. They go nuts just knowing they are getting one!"
1,BHA & BHT & HAIR!!!,"I had bought a pack for my new puppy thinking he will love these.""NOTE THIS WAS NOT THE SELLER"" Little did I know there would be short light brown hair's all in the treat's. I know sounds disgusting, But thank god I did on the first treat because after searching the web I later found out how bad the preservative, dye's and By products are in these and other big box brand treats along with the food's. I am switching to a natural living food diet and thinking small companies such as Orijen & The Honest Kitchen. MY BABY WILL BE HAPPY AND HEALTH as long as i can help it!! P.S. later I found out that these big box store brands use euthanized animals from the shelter ""By Product"" do your research if it smells like poo and it looks like poo yeah it probably is...Well POO!"
4,early work by umberto eco,"charming and well written, although the original in Italian was published in 1979, long before personal computers and online research became the norm."
1,Warning: will not play on PS2,"If you're like many and use a Playstation 2 as your DVD player, BEWARE - this DVD of ""Weekend"" has serious problems playing on the PS2. Two of the special features do not work, resulting in freezing a still image on the screen before the PS2 finally gives up with an ""unable to read disc"" message, and the film itself exhibits the same behavior when you get into the later chapters. I waited for ""Weekend"" to come out on DVD for years and was majorly bummed by this. I can understand a few incompatibilities when the PS2 was brand new, but there's simply no excuse for DVD's being released that don't work on the system these days."
4,expect to be both entertained and bored,"this film is full of good ideas. but theyre unstructured and ultimately unengaging. I like good ideas so im being generous with my four star rating.like alphaville - i wish a daring film maker would have the guts to do a remake and develop this film until it reaches its true potential.this film is more like a brilliant sketchpad than an actual work of art.P.S. i noticed that the sex monologue was ""inspired"" by Bataille's Story of the Eye. and there were other areas seemingly inspired by Maldoror and Shaw's Man and SUperman."
1,Worst movie of all time?,"I have been happy ever since first seeing this movie in college because know I have the definitive answer to the worst move I have ever seen. I was definitely a fan of Godard's earlier work that I had seen, but this movie just seems to concentrate on making it the most unpleasant experience in the history of film! Here are some examples: a 10 minute long tracking shot of a traffic jam where we hear nothing but horns beeping; a 10 minute long tracking shot where the camera spins around a man playing Mozart by barn; a couple walking across a field that are at first sheep, then turns into wrecked cars, and then who should they run into but Napolean! I must admit the scenes are so terrible they are indeliably stuck in memory."
1,Are there O stars?,"I am SOOOOOOOO mad. I've just wasted almost two hours of my life watching this ""movie."" And why? Because of the reviewers that gave this piece of sh** 5 and 4 star ratings. What exactly are you people on that you would even remotely like this film? Maybe it's that pretentious, high-brow snobbery that the best pseudo-intellectuals are versed in. I like alot of French films: Betty Blue, Amelie, etc., but this is sheer garbarge couched in ""let's see how much I can piss off my audience before they claim I'm a genius."" The next time someone wants to make a movie like this, PLEASE, give the money and the camera to 12-year old with a 70 IQ. I guarantee it will be ALOT better."
3,Some Fun,"At times silly, dark, boring, irreverent, fun, boring, hip, and boring (European). While Weekend pushes the or breaks the limits of the film medium stylistically, it adheres dogmatically to Marxist principles in terms of character (if you can call them that), plot, dialogue, and theme. Often sinks to the level of a religious propaganda film, strictly Marxist, intentionally pedantic, but a little fun at times (traffic scene, inter-titles, a funny line about the Congo).And this Criterion Release comes with a lot of zany explanatory material for those of us who don't speak Marx, so everyone ought to ""get it"" eventually."
5,"A brilliant, beautiful story","This excellent manga features rounded characters, beautiful artwork, and a complex plot. The action scenes seem to be in motion. Each character displays many facets as an immortal swordsman, Manji, helps young Rin avenge her parents. There's plenty of gore, though the more frightening portion of the story deals with the psychology of the disturbed ""bad guys."" This is plot driven and fully enveloping. I've read many other manga, but this was the first that completely sucked me in. Try it, you will be enchanted."
3,What's all the hype about?,"After buying this book on the strength of the Amazon customer reviews I will be more cautious in the future. I was very disappointed in this book. The art work everyone was raving about I found to be O.K. In my opinion it wasn't nearly as good as Yukito Kishiro's work in the Battle Angel Alita books. Kishiro's work is much superior and his stories, generally, are more interesting and intellectually relevent. Blade of the Immortal is only so-so."
5,The best Manga out--perhaps the best comic out,"Not only do we get beautiful art with this book, but a terrific story. Today, most manga seems to deal with sci-fi futuristic robots and technologically advanced cultures. What makes Blade so different is that it takes place in feudal Japan, and is much more fantasy than science fiction. It's truly a great series, and a great read. My only complaint is Rin's seeming incompetence in combat."
3,"Impressive, but disgusting!","Blade of the Immortal, Blood of a Thousand, was pretty amazing. Very interesting storyline and some of the best art I've ever seen in a manga, BUT the I was repelled from it rather quickly there is a lot of cursing and extremely graphic scenes. Numerous people are completly mutilated in detail. Of course it is about a samurai but more violent than I expected. Great book if you can deal with some vulgar language and gory battle sequences."
3,"Good artwork, spotty translation, mildly interesting plot.","I wouldn't call myself a huge fan of Manga, but I did greatly enjoy some of the english paperback versions of Nausicaa and Akira. I figured Blade of the Immortal would be an interesting and similar journey as these. Not so. The best thing about this graphic novel is the artwork. The worst thing is probably the prototypical hyper-violent imagery. Very reminiscent of the (much, much worse) Ninja Scroll film and other similar works. The translation is very spotty at times, and the story tends to jump around in transitions that are not exactly smooth. To me, it resembles the sort of fare you would expect from pulp fiction (the genre, not the film). There are some interesting stories, though, which save it somewhat."
3,Three Came Home,"Three Came Home was a decent film highlighting of course... Claudette Colbert. A little syrupy at times even in the war setting; however, it will hold your attention."
4,It's the dancing that makes this so special,"I have watched this movie a LOT!! I own it in the VHS format. It's not a great storyline... it's not an intriguing plot.... but... it is a lovely story of a jaded dancer meeting innocense for the first time in a very long time. I think that the story itself is cute, not mesmerizing but..... the dancing, especially by Baryshnikov is unbelievably heartstopping. There is no other dancer who makes my heart pound and my soul cry out for more. For sure.... the ballet itself is the highlight of this movie but.... watch it without high expectations regarding the plot and story line and you will not be disappointed."
3,"no plot, but oh what a misha!","It's true, this movie really has no plot; Dancers is just a vessel used to get out into the public Giselle, a truly beautiful ballet. I have no problem with that. If you aren't interested in seeing something deep, but rather desire to see Misha dance then this movie definitely would suffice. Every time I rent it I zip through the ""story"" and just watch the dancing. I am blow away by the talent of this amazing man."
3,"Bad acting, great dancing, enjoyable.","With Baryshnikov cast as himself and weak supporting characters, the movie is much more enjoyable if you watch it as a farce. The dancing is definitely worth watching, and the story isn't bad."
2,Kind of like watching a porn movie...,"Nobody watches a porn movie for the acting or the plot. They watch it for... well, you know what they watch it for.This movie is alot like that. You don't watch it to see how great Baryshnikov or anyone else acts or for the plot. You watch it for the dancing. By the time they got into the secondhalf of the movie where they were dancing Giselle -- I found myself completely forgetting that it was supposed to be a ""real"" movie and not a taped version of Giselle. The dancing was beautiful all the way around.So, do as one reviewer did... fast forward past the supposedplot and go straight for the dancing... Or, just buy a taped version of Giselle -- though I don't know if one exists with Baryshnikov and he realy is the main attraction."
4,A guilty pleasure for ballet lovers,"Filmed at the height of the Baryshnikov-era ABT's excesses, this American Ballet Theatre vehicle has a thin plot, barely excusible acting, and is generally the sort of film that no one but the most dedicated ballet fan would watch.But oh the dancing! Julie Kent, still a corps de ballet member is innocent and bursting with youthful energy. While her voice is a travesty, her dancing is eloquent. Misha is at the height of his powers. Leslie Browne, Alessandra Ferri, Lynn Seymour, Amanda McKerrow, and Victor Barbee are all in this gem of a film, which captures an age of ABT while I, for one, would never like to forget.This needs to be released in DVD, post haste, before that era is forgotten to the ages."
3,"bad movie, great dancer","This movie has a predictable and not very original plot. as a regular movie it's quite negligible. But the dancing by Baryshnikov is something else. If you think you already saw the ballet ""Giselle"" - think again - this dancer is from a different planet."
1,As shocking a seeing your mother drunk.,"When Garbo made what turned out to be her last movie Time magazine wrote of her in the film, ""It is as shocking as seeing your mother drunk!"" That's how I felt when I watched this video. Baryshnikov still playing himself, and coming across as not very likeable, as well as downright unsympathetic, as opposed to his stage persona. This time he is called Anton and making heavy weather of a filmed production of Giselle. The film parodies the ballet's story with a happy ending, in which the young innocent girl gets a tattoo! Truly. Baryshnikov is too old to have the close up pan into every pore of his crow footed eyes. As for the dancer actually dancing Giselle, I would have been more than happy if Anton had corrected her arms and port-des-bras, which are completely amateur. I found this movie both shallow and sad. Another [and hopefully, final] cinematic glimpse into Baryshnikov's personal angst which I, for one, could well live without."
2,"Dancers, Not Actors",I enjoyed the ballet. I was bored by the movie storyline. The dancing was passionate. The acting was uninspired. An inane movie.
2,Anything Box with their worst album to date............,"Since Diana left the band, Claude S. seems to be strugling to make great music like the old days. Claude S. experimented with new sounds that sounds terible. The addition of guitars and spacy pop noises just didn't do it for me (a long time fan). The music is not good at all like the old synth-pop sounds we all came to love from Anything Box. I also dont care much for the lyrics in this album (very cheezy). Their later release ""universe is expanding"" is much better than ""Electrodelica"" as they improved the new sound that the group was aiming for with this album but it is still nothing like the old days. This is the bands worst album to date and although I am a big fan, I do not recomend this album unless you are a die hard fan and just want to have all their stuff to keep in your collection and not ever listen to it like myself."
5,Blew me away!!,"I read the reviews and was a bit skeptacle when I purchased this. It certainly is different than Peace and Hope (the only other two I own) but it is still one of the best CDs I have heard in years. I just recently discovered these guys as they were cited as being an influence for the Echoing Green. Since the EG's new CD seems like I will be old and frail before it ever comes out I needed to find something to get that ""fix"".This CD is great pop music. It has that synthpop sound with guitars and sort of a ""Beatles"" prescence to it. The vocals are top notch!! Almost every song is a sing along!!I wish I could afford to buy a copy of Worth but will probably just download it someday. I hope the next CD I purchase is half as good as this and I will be happy!! Continue to hear conflicting reports of their sound after this CD. Someone even went so far as to compare their sound to the Partridge Family on a few CDs. YIKES!! But I am not quick to judge. I can handle the PF in moderation."
4,ANYTHING BOX BREAKS NEW GROUND!,"This is a big switch from their last couple records. For those of you who expect the same sound, think again. This new record has a really groovy feel to it. There are moments of brilliance like Dirt, Autumn, Need, Doubt, and a wonderful piano ballad at the end. The mix of samples and sounds is awesome. There are some good upbeat songs, but the slower ones caught my attention first. That isn't to say the record is without flaws. There are a couple so-so songs, and a couple that sound like The Beatles, but we forgive you. I actually congatulate Claude S. for having the cojones to do what he wants and taking his band to another level. The artwork is totally PHAT, the lyrics are included, and you get 4 bonus songs. Now go out and buy everything from this band. And Claude, if you ever read this, I am a musician and would love to work with you. Peace, MoradoPS- I suggest this order to listen to the songs- 1, 3, 7, 11, 14, 15, 17, 4, 8, 10, 20-then whatever..."
5,worthy of a gold medal,This is a 14 inch fully detailed figure of Olympic gold medal winner and current WWE star Kurt Angle. I like these type of figures as decorative conversation pieces. This figure features a very nice reproduction of Angle's appearance and includes a replica scaled version of his gold medal.
4,my review,this toy looks like it is in great condition.it's in its package and thats somthing that i would buy if i wanted it.
1,What is this stuff supposed to do?,"I tried to stick with this stuff. I really did. The problem is, it did nothing for me.I have extremely dry skin combined with excema during the summer months due to my grass allergy and the fact that I like to golf. After applying a very small amount of Nouriva Repair, my hands became extremely greasy. This stuff would not evaporate, nor would my skin absorb it. I found that the only practical ways to use it were to either wear cotton gloves to bed, which is something I do occasionally anyway, or to not touch anything at all for eight hours after applying it. However, due to the fact that my skin remained dry and my excema remained flaired up, I've come to the conclusion that I wasted $18 on a tube of this stuff."
5,...is but to fall in love with Offenbach himself!,"I do not believe there are any cd's in my entire collection that I have listened to as many times as I have listened to this one! Tableaux Troix is nearly worn out! Thanks to a slight taste of the english lyrical versions of Offenbach on Lesley Garrett's 'Soprano in Red' album, I new I had to have more, and if Garrett was a taste then Desay is truly the meal! Everything about this album was great. The preformance of all the cast to the sound quality (which seems always to be of a high caliber with EMI) go beyond excellence! I can not recommend this cd but demand that you hear it and you will know what I am talking about!"
2,"RKO,please!","I say this toy is pretty good and Randy Orton is a great wrestler but theres one thing that made me give it such a low reveiw Randy was beaten by a 5'6"" masked wrestler named Rey Mysterio and i say Rey is one of Randys biggest enemys and i gave this toy a low review because this 6'4"" great wrestler is afraid of a wrestler thats about a foot shorter than you. a 5'6"""
4,"Great follow-up to ""Worth"", the album never released.","For all synth-pop fans out there, there aren't many bands that actually have great songs to back them up. It's usually about showing off the technology being used or the cool keyboards they have. But this band plays from the heart. They just happen to use a lot of cool sounding gear. Break down the song to piano or acoustic guitar, and you'll see what I'm talking about. 'Hope' really shows the world what Anything Box is about. They are about keeping true to themselves. The album sounds like it was them calling all the shots which is why it sounds more personal. ""Blue Little Rose"" is a beautiful song with a great melody. ""Answer Me"" and ""Happiness"" are great dance songs that just make you feel good. ""Every Single Day"" gives you that ""hope"" that you've been needing. All the songs use cool rhythms and great sounds. Which is what synth pop is all about. If you liked 'Peace', their first album, you won't be disappointed with 'Hope'."
5,Finally watched it,When I was a teen Upstairs Downstairs was on TV and was quite popular with the old folks. I was way too cool to watch it then. Now I am over 50 - am no longer cool - and thoroughly enjoyed watching it.
3,Karate Belt Display,The photo shows 9 belts on the display but when you receive it it will only hold one belt. You need to pay extra for additional belt holders at over $3.00 a piece. That makes this item to expensive for what you receive.
1,Rip-off! Buyer Beware!,The Amazon web page shows the belt display with 9 belts. The product arrived with one belt holder. There is no mention on the web site that each belt holder must be bought seperately. This is false advertising. I would never have bought the belt-holder if I had known the truth. I called the vendor and they were not interested that their product was being falsely represented.
1,Belt Rack Display,"I wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this item. I also looked at the picture and thought the belt rack came with the additional attachments. I wouldn't have purchased this rack had I known. The rack itself is fair quality, but add on the additional costs for the belt holders and it is grossly overpriced for the quality."
4,not God as some people praise it at but pretty damn good,"very very enjoyable flick, mainly because it reminded me of FMJ(full metal jacket) and the humor was pretty good too. i might have preferred this film a little better if charlie s. wasnt in it but he actualy didnt do that bad of a job one part i found hysterical was that johnny depp has a part in it. with short blonde hair and he just is walking by then gets blown up. this film should deffinalty be in a war collects colection."
4,Complete folly !!!,"Excellant film showing the horrors of war and of what war does to man, should be showing in all schools to show the idiocy of Vietnam and to never let it happen again.Great acting by charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger and Willam Dafoe.A very good dvd with good extras.A well done to Oliver Stone."
2,Fiction !,This movie was based on not greater than 10% fact and no less than 90% fiction. One only needs to read Robert Hemphill's book Platoon: Bravo Company to fine the truth.
2,way too isolated and without emotions,"Oliver Stone's was a veteran of Vietnam himself and he appears late in this movie, which is unfortunate for his own sake, because if I were him, I'd want to be hiding from this movie, pretending to have nothing to do with it. The three main soldiers (Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger) hate each other from the very beginning and everyone knows before it begins that it is about the loss of innocence because war is hell, so the things that happen to the three of them are pretty predictable. In some of his better work, mainly The Doors and Natural Born Killers, Oliver Stone uses a lot of effort to show the effect that the plot is having on the rest of the world. In The Doors, we see footage of Vietnam because it was transpiring at the same time. Likewise for Nixon. However, in this movie, we just see the war itself without seeing the outside world reacting to it as it unfolds. Oliver Stone does better work in the 90's."
3,Could have been better...,"I prefer other war movies to this such as the much under-rated HamBurger Hill and brilliant Full Metal Jacket. This is mainly because I found them to be much grittier, violent and realistic. I know you don't need blood and guts to make a good movie, however in a war movie....you do. It just makes it that all the more real.But I don't want to put you off, please do watch this. I've purchased a copy and although it's not my favourite war film, it's still good!"
1,lame,"Rather than being about the Vietnam war as it really was, this film is basically an exercise in what America wants the vietnam war to be. Despite endless comments to the contrary, there is nothing ""realistic"" about the film. The characters and plot are almost cartoonish. Its like a postmodernist John Wayne movie with different politics.In real life, things don't break down into ""good"" soldiers and ""evil"" soldiers. Real life and real people are about shades of grey. The war also changed over time. Oliver Stone served in 1967 but the movie is often showing situations that were more out of 1971 with which he had no personal experience.What a real film about vietnam would show is ordinary people doing a tough job day after day and doing the best they could. Its not about archtype evil officers, good/evil ""father"" figures and long political monologues.About the only thing this film got right were the uniforms."
1,"Platoon, more like Platoverated.","This film is all bits and pieces and does not come together as a whole. The acting is terrible for the most part and especially bad in the case of the lead ""Charlie Sheen"". A couple of memorable looking scenes and some shock value plot points got this film splashed on the cover of every magazine and on to the Academy awards. Full Metal Jacket came out roughly the same time and is the far better movie."
2,The DVD cover,"I just took the plastic part of the DVD off last night. (I already have the film on VHS). The bottom left part of the DVD case broke right away. I don't think this should happen when I paid that much for the special edition. It should have a nice paper cover over the plastic cover, and the plastic cover should be of higher quality. Also, if it was packaged in something to protect it better maybe this would not have happened, but I don't know if that is why it happened."
4,"Good movie, DVD?","We all know PLATOON is a good movie, but for a dvd movie it just dosent cut it. The sound is terrible for a DVD movie. Nothing like Saving Private Ryan. If you already have the VHS version dont bother getting the DVD version. No speacil fetures included but the trailer."
5,"Amazing film, but wheres the extras on this DVD","This is the best Vietnam War film ever made. The action is great, the acting is superb and the story tells a terrific tale. What disappoints me with this dvd re-release is that there are no addons which most dvd's tend to have, then again, the price tends to reflect this, its one of the lowest priced new dvd's I have purchased, almost as cheap as a cd.Its obvious why this movie won the best picture Oscar in 1986. It would win again almost any other year since then as well. A timeless classic which everyone should see."
5,One of the greatest war movies of our time.,"Platoon has to be one of, if not the best accounts of the viet nam war. It shows what the war was really about and the horror that is war. I can not understand why we the public can not have access to this movie on dvd. It may have been less than perfect but the studio can certainly remedy those small problems. Is this what the studio does to an acadamy award picture. Rather than fix it they just put it on the shelf to collect dust. Its a shame that we of the viet nam generation and those that did not live through this war can not have the privilage of viewing it."
2,Kind of OK,"Not the best movie I've seen about the Vietnam war. Truthfully, there really haven't been many accurate movies, the closest to the mood I'd have to say is Full Metal Jacket, but not nearly as close as the book came.If you want to believe that Vietnam was about all the cool kids smoking pot, killing their officers, and chastising the less fortunate, this movie is for you. Not that great in my opinion, and does a great disservice to veterans.I certainly wouldn't want my grandkids seeing this and thinking that this was the way it was, it wasn't. Almost a disgrace."
4,Tragedy in Vietnam,"The video protrays the deep seated frustration of Army troops serving in Vietnam revealed by the numerous fighting among ourselves. The ending thought accurately depicts the movie when the leading character states to the effect,that the enemy was more ourselves than the North Vietnamese."
5,Truly Essential for War flick buffs.,"Actually, a must have for anyone who enjoys a good picture. All star cast, great story, truly moving in an emotional sense (watch the Bunker Scene, with Smokey Robinson's ""Tracks of My Tears""). WATCH THIS MOVIE!!Gonzo"
4,Stone's Vietnam,"Perhaps THE Vietnam War movie, highly tauted and regarded. It looks at a single platoon, which seems to be divided between sadists and survivalists. Tom Berenger is the sadistic sergeant; Willem Dafoe the more humane one in the company. Charlie Sheen as Chris is the newcomer, a rich idealist of sorts, who as a new recruit comes to hate Berenger and his craziness. Lots of stark, gory violence, and the movie even gets preachy at the end. The film numbs one's sensibilities rather than moves them. But it's still among the better movies dealing with Nam."
5,So real it is scary,"Many Vietnam type movies although action filled do not really portray how life was in the country and the issues the men endured.This movie was a flashback for me to the real life happenings.The frustration, hurt, anguish, hatred, betrail, terror faced each and every day, and the rawness of the blood and guts were vividly shown. There is no honor, glory, compassion in war. The John Wayne movies are a farce to real conditions in the field.This movie truly portrays Vietnam warefre as it was."
3,Platoon (blue ray - 1 disc),"Good war movie, but do not expect its AV quality matchs the latest blue ray disc. It worths the selling price of less than $10."
1,Jack55,"I first saw Platoon in a theater in Waikiki as a member of the 25th ID, which is the same division depicted in the film. A big chunk of the audience also seemed to be from Schofield Barracks. They cheered wildly at some parts, like whenever a charcter refered to ""grunts"" or killing VC. We were all very young and had no way to know what Vietnam was really like. I enjoyed the move. It's entertaining and well acted, but is very much more of a work of fiction than I at first realised. I came to this opinion after reading the book ""Platoon - Bravo Company"" by Robert Hemphill. He was Oliver Stone's company commander in Vietnam. His book paints a much more honorable picture of the unit and is much closer to my peace-time impression of the US Army than Stone's criminal/irresponsible characters. Read Hemphill's book and skip this movie."
3,"A Good Film, But...","This was a good film. Platoon does a much better job than its predecessors (most notably the Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now)of bringing the realities of the Vietnam War home for an average viewer, just as Vidor's The Great Parade did for the Great War in 1925. It shows the hypocrisy and immorality of the Vietnam war. But despite all the preparations Stone put his actors through, I could never take their performances seriously; they just looked and felt too Hollywood. While I recognize its poignancy, Charlie Sheen's narration still felt contrived and unnatural. The scene where Berenger is over Sheen about to kill him when the bombs hit looked like pure Hollywood hokum. Thus, while this film is more important than its earlier Vietnam rivals, its ultimately less successful at being a great film (Oscars not withstanding). Finally, this isn't even Stone's best film of 1986... that honor certainly goes to Salvador for a gripping story and a performance of a lifetime by James Woods."
2,An Ax to Grind,"On one hand this movie it is a masterful, creative work of art--a beautifully filmed, superbly acted, and skillfully directed film. On the other hand, it is a historical piece of garbage and a slap in the face to every vet who ever served honorably in Vietnam, including me. But unfortunately, as has been noted in film before, particularly in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,"" when the myth becomes larger than the truth, people tend to print the myth. Here Stone has succeeded in printing a myth that fits his warped sense of patriotism, or lack of patriotism, and he uses this myth to heap revenge on his country and his fellow veterans for some perceived harm done to him. I suspect it is harm done to him by someone else that he has projected onto his country and its veterans, but that may be my trained counselor side speaking. So for me, this movie is more about a disturbed man with an ax to grind than it is about an artist with a story to tell."
4,What the....,"Sure, it's good, but how the heck did this get a better rating than it's superior: ""The Deer Hunter?"" 4 1/2"
5,Classic Vietnam war movie,"I couldn't belive the price I got this movie for. It is a great movie about the Vietnam war.The fact that I got the Blu-ray DVD combo pack for less than the regular price for just the DVD on other web sites, just shows that it pays to shop on Amazon!!!"
1,Must be loving it Classic !!!!!,"I do not know whether I should I love movies because it is a classic? Let me be frank with you many of the old movies do not rise to the level required in terms of acting, or directing attention to the story or the characters in depth, for example, this movie Platoon I could not keep watching it is boring to the nth degree did not like the movie characters were not an exciting storyMy point in the movies is what can be good to watch them againIn this case would give me a thousand dollars can not watch this movie again"
1,An unpleasantly violent movie,"I bought this movie for my partner, it is his favorite movie and the original was gnarled by the VCR. I watched a fraction of the movie and found what I saw extremely distasteful. If you find violence towards children and the mentally challenged offensive I recommend that you avoid this movie."
1,Aggressive and offensive,"Probably equivalent with (and as objectionable as) ""Good Fellas"" as a best picture of the year, ""Platoon"" is so offensive that it is painful to watch. Even with the sound reduced to near minuscule volume, it still grates on any artistic awareness. How can anybody wish to put him- herself through such an experience? Masochists, this is for you."
1,you Call this a movie,"This movie made Barrnys big fling or with ever you call it look good, heck it made it look like the best movie of the year. Wait dont get me wrong there was one good part that i like and that was when the screen turned black and the credits rolled up the screen! 1"
5,Platoon is to Vietnam what Saving Private Ryan was to WWII,"An outstanding film with a realistic first-person perspective on war. The popularity of Platoon can be measured by the fact that when it was discontinued and made unavailable in the DVD format (this is the second release) ... it sold for between $80 and $120 used, and it was very difficult to find. I, for one, am very pleased that it has once again been made available in DVD format and can't wait to get my very own copy.Platoon is THE Vietnam war movie and is head and shoulders above all the others. It's an amazingly realistic look at a very frightening moment in our recent past. Platoon is horrific, exciting, entertaining and unforgetable. At it's new price..., it's a must-have for any good DVD collection.Platoon, Private Ryan, (and soon) The Patriot. Highly recommended. 10 stars."
4,Vietnam al rojo vivo!!!!,"Esta pelicula muestra el verdadero significado de la guerra, la sin razon!!, desvela el manto de heroismo y misticismo que siempre a tenido."
4,It isn't looked at in the proper way.,"People see this movie and are like ""Hey, that part's cool when he kills that guy."" or ""When he smokes that weed."" or ""When that dude dies."". This movie isn't about the action. It's about Charlie Sheen's struggle on the inside. He gets to know one of his CO's only for him to get shot be the other CO, who is a crazed maniac. This movie is about the horrors of war and what it does to people, how it changes people. It's not about guys shooting the guts out of their enemies for pleasure."
2,This item came defective. Unable to play in my blu ray player. Returned...,It's ddnt work when I got it at all. Hopefully the return and reshipping is worth the wait. We'll see.
4,Great movie,Great movie. Heard a lot about it before watching lived up to expectations. Was def worth it. Would watch again.
4,Set in Stone...,"Wow! Ranks as one of the most interesting and thought provoking war movies of all time. I loved this movie for a number of reasons. One, i'm a big Sheen fan. Two, i like war movies. And three, it was interesting to see how war affects the minds of seemingly normal and innocent men, and turns them into killing machines. Sheen who plays the 'new boy' so to speak has his morals and his standards when he first starts out, and it was interesting and sad to see him struggle to keep hold of them when all around him he was faced with this inhumanity. Stone, i think this was great. Enjoy!"
2,Vietnam soldiers were NOT like this.,"I spent a tour in Vietnam from '68-'69 and honestly cannot say much good about Stones' depiction of US soldiers. (Note: Stone's ridiculous movie 'Nixon' was roundly criticized as inaccurate. Stone responded with some comment that he was in the business of 'creating history'.) Stone is attempting a brainwashing operation here against the American public. Platoon depicts the oppressive atmosphere of Vietnam well, but his characterizations of the Troops and their interrelations are completely false. 'Platoon' relates to the Vietnam War as a sort of reverse propaganda effort. Kind of like an 'anti-GungHo' flick. The best sort of an anti-war flick is an accurate movie like 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Hamburger Hill' not this sort of commie-prop that Stone has as his life's mission."
2,A Ho Chi Minh Studios production,"Only in Commie-Wood could this piece of garbage left-wing agitprop be lauded as a ""modern day classic"". As anti-American propaganda, it's far too crude and obvious to be taken seriously, as it utilizes every last Vietnam cliche' in the book, depicting American soldiers as drug-addicted, psychotic murderers and rapists, almost to a man. As a drama, it's extremely lacking- the characters are almost completely interchangeable, and of the few who are fleshed out a bit, I found myself incapable of giving a crap. As entertainment, it's utterly boring- from start to finish we're subjected to unceasing and monotonous killing and depravity. You could leave the room for an hour and not really have missed anything by the time you come back. Skip this sucker and keep your money out of Oliver Stone's pocket."
3,Bad audio?,"Is it my imagination, or is there some really bad audio in the movie? I bought my copy at ""Target"", so I assume it is not a bootleg. Anyhow, in the first half of the movie there is a scene where they are all sitting around outside, and in the background there is a very LOUD ""hissing"" noise. The noise comes and goes, and it sounds like the background hiss on old audio cassette tapes. I assume it isn't crickets or anything, becuase I heard it on DVD on my very expensive 5.1 theater system. A very bad job re-mastering in my opinion."
4,Classic,Delves into the non-mentionables of the Vietnam war - items the war was always critiqued for.Excellent film. Could be used for teaching history.
5,when sheen was a real actor,"this is one of the best vietnam movies around ranking high with full metal jacket. Cast of top name actors, love it!"
4,One aspect of Vietnam,"It wasn't that way everywhere, nor were all attitudes about it represented. Like the war, it was politically oriented, but weell done. Tom Berenger shined."
5,Near Perfect,"This is my absolute favorite movie of all movies. Besides the engaging story, the ""yin and yang"" of the sergeants as representations of the private's conscience, and the honesty - it is truly a work of art for one reason. As a young man, I saw this movie in the theater with my father and his friend, who was a vietnam vet. I can recall looking up at my father's friend on several occasions during the film, and seeing him weeping. at that point, I knew that Oliver Stone and his movie had nailed it."
5,The Most Popular Film In The Army in 1987,"Platoon was show to all the basic trainees at Fort Dix, N.J. in 1987. This film featured Charlie Sheen,Tom Berringer and William Dafoe as the three main characters. It gives a vivid picture of Vietnam in 1967."
4,The Most Accurate Retelling Of Vietnam,"Platoon brings Vietnam too life. Oliver Stone really knew what he was talking about. He was there!! Tom Berenger and Willam Dafoe have the most unforgettable roles of the carrer in this film. Platoon sends a powerful message about teamwork and the struggle in Vietnam, where inoccent civilians were murdered, young men's incconce were lost, and valor was lost. But, it is gets borring in some parts and picks up after that. The sound was excellent and brought Vietnam to life. Not for weak stomached though. Some scenes get extremlly grusome. I suggest anyone who was there, likes Vietnam movies, or just plain likes war movies sees this."
4,"It ain't no ""Full Metal Jacket,"" but....","This is still a great, great movie. If you haven't seen this movie and you are any kind of war movie fan, what's wrong with you? Plenty of disturbing, emotional, action-packed, and gripping storytelling here. A can't miss."
5,Why can't we buy it ???,"Seems to me that a ""big outfit"" like Amazon.com could get the studio to produce this video for sale. This video is the best one ever made about the Vietnam war and should be made available for sale. The movie is as close as it gets to showing people what it was really like in Vietnam for the average soldier that served their time there.signed: A Vietnam vet from Texas"
1,Do NOT Buy,This CD is complete garbage. Don't get me wrong - I'm a big fan and that's why I bought it. It's just that the CD consists of excerpts of the listed tracks - one (Ven A Mi) is a 45 second sample. The others are not much longer. Looking at the track list you would think it's a greatest hits CD but it's not. It must have been released out of spite after she switched record labels. Shame on EMI for pulling a stunt like this. I should have known that it's not possible to fit 30 tracks on a one-disc CD. I gave it one star since it's not possible to give a zero.
4,luv.dkL,Grnadson and his friends love the shape. Works fine. Arrive in do time. Great for the basketball nut in the house.
4,A TESTAMENT OF LOVE!!!,"HARRISON'S FLOWERS WAS A HEARTWARMING AND SAD STORY ABOUT THE SIDE-EFFECTS OF WAR AND THE BOUNDARIES OF LOVE.IT HELPS US TO RECOGNIZE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE INDIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE CONDITIONS OF WAR!!THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR THE FREEDOM OF OTHERS, OR IN THIS CASE, FOR THEIR JOBS.THE ACTING WAS VERY GOOD AND THE FILM WAS VERY TOUCHING.THE REASON I AM GIVING THIS DVD A 4 STAR RATING IS BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE SOUND AND PICTURE IS GREAT, THERE ARE NO EXTRA FEATURES ON THIS DVD!!!AS FAR AS THE MOVIE IS CONCERNED, I RECOMMEND IT IF YOU ENJOY GOOD DRAMA.BID IN MIND, THE FILM IS SLOW AT TIMES, BUT ALL-IN-ALL IT IS A TOUCHING AND MEMORABLE MOVIE EXPERIENCE!!!"
1,"Harrison""s Flowers",I ordered this DVD of Harrison's Flowers. Then found out it was discontinued. sellers need to check their inventory to make sure they have it.
3,"Fantastic war scenes, otherwise, nah","If you can get through the gloppy first 30 minutes of this war time love story, you will reach the best of this film: extremely realistic battle scenes of the Serb-Croatian conflict in 1991. The graphic photography is some of the best of modern war movie-making I've ever seen. The big problem is the absurd plot: the wife of a Newsweek photographer trundles off to Serbia to track down her supposedly dead hubby. She teams up with his colleagues as they look, amid death at any moment. How did Adrian Brody keep his goatee so perfect when no one else is shaving, I wondered? Just marvel at the war footage and try to ignore Andie MacDowell's wooden acting."
4,balkans movies,War footage is uncannny in its reality. They must have gone to post Bosnia war areas to get footage of destruction that they showed. Delivers a powerful reminder of the ugliness of the Bosnian war that happened in the civilized western neighbourhood only 18 years ago.
3,EVEN MORE DEPRESSING FOR BUTLER FANS,"Gerard Butler fans, be warned, he's not in this more than probably 30 seconds, not much more than an extra. The movie itself was depressing, but well acted."
2,A Review by David H.,"Mixed feelings aboutHarrison's Flowers: Maybe the timing wasn't right, but I really wasn't feeling the vibe of this movie. The actors and actresses were great but the story lines could-of been better. Out of 12 of us who watched this movie on opening night, 4 liked it. Is this movie Oscar quality? Yes.If you love drama, then you'll love Harrison's Flowers."
4,Great product but not as large as prior equivalent pan,"Went to replace my beloved old large-size Emile Henry gratin and discovered that the new version may have the same measurements, but in reality is smaller. While the stated measurements closely matched my old cracked gratin, the current version's length measurements include the outside handles. So the real cooking capacity is considerably smaller. My old gratin was about 16"" long (without handles) and the new one is 16"" long with handles but only about 11 1/2"" measured interior length. I love the product but wish there was an even larger version so I can roast the same quantities of vegetables, etc as I did before!"
5,fastest shipping ever!,"I bought this Au Gratin dish as a gift so I haven't used it, but it is attractive, looks well-made and seems to be well priced at $55. I mainly want to complement Amazon for getting it to me so quickly. I ordered it Monday, Dec 6th mid-day with the free shipping and it arrived on my door step within 30 hours. The tracking said it left the Amazon facility (not sure where that is) and arrved in Dallas the same evening, got transferred to Houston that night and arrived on my door step 30 miles from Houston Tuesday evening. Amazing speed for this time of year."
5,A must have!,"I don't plan on taking this one out of my CD player anytime soon. The vocals are amazing. I can't believe they put all of these women on the same CD. The variety of talent is amazing. This is not your typical dance CD with one continuous bass beat. Nobody's Supposed to Be Here, One Good Reason and Find Another Woman have gotten a lot of replay time in my car. Go get this CD!"
4,We love these recordings,"Our family has listened to these recordings at night when going to bed for around 20 years now, and we never get tired of them. My wife used to have a problem going to sleep at night, but we are always asleep by half way through one of the recordings. I highly recommend them. I do prefer part 2 and part 4 the most."
5,"I like it, I use it",I have this attached to my Subaru 2004 WRX Wagon. Currently I have a bike rack inserted into the mouth. This was easy to install. I had to go to the hardware store to get some extra bolts.I am completely satisfied.
1,Doesn't fit 2007 Model,This hitch does not fit a 2007 Impreza Outback Sport Limited. The attachment arms are curved in the wrong way.
4,Good for GF1,Bought this for the Lumix GF1. Quality is very good and the fit is very tight (maybe a bit too tight). Otherwise great product.
3,A further slide into vanilla,"I have to say I really enjoy the early Guardians of the Flame novels. However, my overall impression is that each successive book gets less interesting than the one before it, and this book is no exception. It simply lacks anything to set it apart from the crowd. Its not that its badly written (Although Rosenberg has a nasty tendency to get extremely repetitive with the character quips and descriptions) because it isn't. Its not that its a terrible story, because it isn't. It just doesn't have that same spark that early books in the series had. Next time I read through the Guardians of the Flame series, I will probably just stop at The Road Home and leave this book and its successors on my bookshelf."
2,"Decently written, but grey in nature","The writing style and content are not particularly brilliant, but were captivating enough to keep me turning pages against my better judgment.The enormous difference between this and his previous works caused me to wonder if some great calamity had darkened the author's outlook on life.Unlike his previous works, this novel was permeated by a sort of emotional hollowness, or perhaps cynicism. It almost seemed that he went out of his way to prove that there's no such thing as wrong or right, and that life is ugly and short. I guess if his whole intention was to illustrate how much unlike heroes these three 'heroes' are, Joel Rosenberg succeeded stunningly, but it was a morally grey, depressing, passionless read. Even the 'happy' ending left a bitter taste in my mouth."
5,The Man has Style........,I have to admit when I started this book I was upset that it did not delve into his past characters from the Gaudian's series more. By the time chapter two rolled around I was eagerly turning the pages and regretting the fact that I had to work the next day and needed sleep.What can I say.....Rosenberg has style. His characters are likeable and real. He has a way of turning a phrase that shows his intelligence. Rosenberg comes up with surprises when you need them and his dialogue sizzles.What more can you ask for?Another book by Joel Rosenberg please :)
4,A fun read,This book is a fun read. I started reading the guardians of the Flame series a few years ago and have enjoyed them all.The book starts off a little slow but has great character developement and by the end you won't want to put it down. In fact you'll be sad that it's over.This the first time that the leads of the story are neither Othersiders or the son of an Oothersider and it is fun to see things from a different point of view.
3,It's what I was looking for,"Very cute for my baby, bright orange is easy to find in a stack of her toys. It's a stuffed toy, made decently enough and soft."
3,Not As PICTURED,my chair isnt the same as the one in the photo. (maybe i didnt read the fine print but mine has a zipper top as opposed to the one in the photo that has straps. no big yank... i dont really mind. it's still a handy bag to have on set. not this most comfortable bag but i didnt really expect it would be for a chair bag with a mettal frame on your back side for only $20.
1,they are still selling this piece of crap?,"i bought this camera years ago. black screen of death after a year or so. spent a day to fix it (you'll find instructions on the web). i probably didnt clean the lubricant from the iris well enough - black screen again after 3 months. in the drawer ever since.maybe i try cleaning it again on a rainy day... it,s just ridiculous that sanyo still sells this item. i never got so annoyed with any other electronics gadget - sanyo has been on my black list since the hd1 experience. am i too unforgiving? i dont think so!"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"when it worked, it worked great, but after about 2 weeks, the screen went black and stayed that way. luckily, i bought it used for cheap. unluckily, that voided the warranty. last sanyo product i will ever buy...ever. cant even find a place in my town that sells or can fix them. not willing to pay 200 dollars to get it repaired by the company. big ripoff. really pissed. i guess ill just have to live with throwing 350 dollars out the window."
5,"Sanyo ""High Definition"" camcorder is remarkable","I found the Sanyo ""High Definition"" Camcorder to be the real deal.Recording in 720P is the only way to go. Playback is amazing and on my HDTV.I thought the small size my be a disadvantage but found the built-in stabilization to be adequate.The ability to use as a Digital Still camera is also advantageous.Also learned to operate this camcorder quite quickly with its easy to use menu."
3,"Not Bad, but not Great",Good: HD wow! Small and still comfortable to hold. Easy and intuitive control settingsBad: Not suitable for low light situations. I compared this side by to my Sony DV and it was not comparable. Lag in filming and then viewing.I was expecting a bit more from this camcorder and felt it still had a ways to go.
1,Screen goes black - do not buy!!!,"I purchased the camera in mid June 2006. After 1 month/1 hr of recording the screen went black when in recording mode. It took the shop about 7 week to fix the problem. I used the camera to record another 20 minutes and now it does not want to focus to infinite. The recording now flickers a lot and a dot appears floating around the screen. This camera has been in the shop more time than in my hands. The store were I bought it said that It would give me a new camera if this happends for the thrid time. The only problem is that if this is a design problem, what do I get by getting a new camera? Just avoid buying this camera until they fix the problem."
1,Don't Buy This Camera....,..unless you don't mind sending it in for repairs! I've had this camera for just over 3 months now and am sending it back in for repair a second time for the same issue. That issue: monitor blacks out and doesn't pick up the image in camera nor video mode as if the lens cap is on. Beware: mfg warranty is a mere 3 months so put aside some funds for repairs. I'd like to just return the darn thing but Amazon's return policy has so many penalties I'm better off just keeping and dealing. Urrrgggh!
3,good,"received camera 2 days ago ,great size ,video recording in daylight is good as long as its not played back on included quicktime software,I use nero ,night time recording terrible on all settings ,nigttime stills good ,daytime stills good , but my 4mp pentax blows this away on stills.I will be keeping this camera because kids are small ,and already have missed too many videos ( my other video camera is too bulky to carry around) acceptable except for night time indoor videos.(other reviewer with clicking problem ,use manual focus. rob"
1,Black screen of death,I was amazed to read the reviews that mirrored my personal experience. This will be my last Sanyo anything... Sanyo should have provided firmware to fix their lighting shortcomings and paid for the massive amount of camera failures.
2,Black screen of death,"5 days after the one year warranty expired I turned the camera on and there was no preview image on the view screen. Everything else seemed fine, it took pictures (although blank), the sound was working, voice instructions were OK too. Checked some HD1 forums and found this to be a very common problem with HD1's. Called tech support and was told I was to pay for parts and labor since it was out of warranty. Labor was only 90 days anyway. I asked the tech if there was a possibility of a recall and was told ""no"". Too bad, it was a good video camera. Stills need quite a bit of light. Stay away from used HD1's. I think I will stay away from Sanyo after this experience."
1,Do not Buy. Very Big mistake!!,"This camera has major problems. Do your research. Go to any digital camera forums and you will see tons of post of the ""black Screen"". After using our camera about 5 times the screen became black. Apparently had to do with defective lens housing or something. Sent it to their customer care service. Took 1 month to get back. 3 days later black screen is back. Sanyo is doing everything they can to prevent me from getting money back or get new camera. They just want me to keep sending to customer. Care. Sanyo has a very defective product and they do not want to admit their mistake and replace the defective cameras. See for yourself. Go to the forums and see what others have been saying. Don't make the mistake I did."
1,Great when it works - but it rarely works,"I love everything about this little camera - except for its very low quality of manufacture. Three cameras bought and three cameras returned, each with hardware and software problems. Sanyo let this one out before it was ready. What a shame. Maybe rev two will be worthy, but stay away from this one unless you enjoy ""SYSTEM ERROR"" messages appearing on screen (if your screen works) that require a camera reboot."
2,Took three months for my screen to go black,"Before that it was kind of nice, but it cannot focus in even semi-low light.It is definitely light and easy to take everywhere, but there are so many conditions where the results are disappointing. No way I would call the output HD quality, just the best SD ever with a 16 * 9 format. And then it broke."
1,Version 4 is out,Fugawi is offering version 4 with Pocket PC support for $99.A much better deal I think.http://www.fugawi.com/docs/BRC-FUGAWI-GN-US-EN.pdfJeannette
4,Guniess Seal,This one is from the same place and it is perfect.It has the retro look and is very clear.
3,Madonna I'll Remember,"First thing I have to say I wouldn't call this beautiful song ""Theme From With Honors"" it is Madonna's song. The remixes are okay. The last song Why Is It So Hard Live from the Girlie Show is great. You can also hear Why Is It So Hard on the Girlie Show DVD. This single no matter what is great."
2,In one word - Disappointing,I thought the cast was strong - this attracted me to the movie. But the storyline is quite weak and the pace of the movie is slow. This is such a shame as the movie could have been so much better. Don't waste your money there is not enough here to cover the cost of the DVD. It is disappointing because they had the talent but the direction was not good and it really plodded along at a very slow pace.
2,Very mediocre movie,"I was looking forward to seing this movie since it had a great cast. Amy Smart, Seth Green and the very handsome and sexy Stewart Townsend are capable of delivering great stuff. However there was not much they could do with such a boring and unispired script. Another cookie cutter romantic comedy with little substance. It seems Hollywood is churning these out a dime a dozen these days. I love romantic comedies. But so many of these kinds of movies now are just cliche and predictable stories. What a shame, as these actors could have done wonders with a little better material. Despite this, Seth Green manages to handle the comedic aspect of the film very well. And the male lead is excellent eye candy. That pretty much sums up my two stars."
4,Very Funny,"Both my husband and I enjoyed this movie. It was very, very funny. I am a fan of Stuart Townsend and Amy Smart. Also the best friend, Seth Green, was hilarious. If you are looking to watch a romantic comedy...watch this one. It is a little predictable but done, in my opinion, very well."
1,Didn't even finish the movie,The movie was slow and boring. So much that I didn't even finish watching it. Wasted my money renting it. Glad it was only $1.99.
3,Dunno.,"Well, since I ordered and paid for this but never got it, I can't review it, but Michelle is always great, so I assume it is good."
1,not very satisfied,this walker is not very flexible .i put my daughter in here and it doesnt allow her to walk freely . it only goes foward and backward.she does enjoy the small toys that are in the front . but thats not the purpose for this . if you get a walker try to get one that the wheels move freely anywhere. the ones with castor wheels are great.
4,Great Walker,I really like this walker. My son is 8 months old and he loves the lights and music on the walker. He loves the mobility of it. He looks like he's flying across the room in it! My sister-in-law just put one on her baby registry. I highly recommend it.
4,I Was Surprised!,A couple of girls at work told me to register for a walker. I was reluctant with the my 1st child who is now 7. I read all these articles about how they tip over. Since then I have noticed that they have been designed differently - wider bases - to avoid this possible danger.I did register for it and I then thought about returning it. It turns out I didn't and we actually set it up in my mother's house since she would be watching our little girl while I would be at work.She really enjoyed this. She was able to push herself around and she liked playing with it. I was really surprised and glad I didn't return it.
4,Not for Short Babies,"Believe the other reviewer who wrote that this walker is not for short babies. My son is pretty tall for his age and even his feet don't touch the ground. Poor thing dangles there. I have been putting a pillow under his feet. He's only 4 months old so I am hoping he will grown into this walker. I am a bit disappointed in the two rattle toys at the front corners of the walker. They are so far away and it makes reaching for them a bit difficult....and ultimately frustrating for my son. I have hardwood floors so it glides nicely but I can see how it wouldn't for carpet. It lays low to the ground. The upside of this product is that the music is pleasant and cheery. The lights are entertaining. My son encountered the same problem with the toy bar where the little stars slide. The toy bar is situated too far. Not only does your child need to be VERY tall, apparently, your child also needs long ape arms to reach the far toys."
2,SoSo,"This walker is just okay. Looks-wise, it is a little too colorful--a bit crazy. It doesn't move as freely on the floor as I would like--turning and swiveling. The height of the walker is not really ""adjustable"" either. The fabric seat can be cinched up a small distance, but the ""lowest setting"" is not terribly low. When I first purchased the walker, my twins were 6 months old and tall for their age; yet, they were still barely able to touch the floor in this walker. Now that they are 7 1/2 months, they can move better, but it is bulky and difficult.The only thing I am grateful for is the fact that it gives them the opportunity to be upright and relatively mobile for short spans of time. Other than that, I would have returned it on the spot!!"
3,Convenient but not the best,"We bought this walker because it will come apart for minimal storage space and because it was a two-in-one walker. It was too tall for my tall daughter and we had to put a large book underneath. She cannot move it on the low carpet yet at 6 months of age, but can use it outside on concrete and on linoleum. The turning radius is not very great, but the music is enjoyable. She gets frustrated that nothing can be pulled into her mouth, but still enjoys playing with the toys that are available. She really enjoys the exersaucer with all the toys that are so reachable and that can be pulled to the mouth."
