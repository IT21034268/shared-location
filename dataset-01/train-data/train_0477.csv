5,The universe manifests,"Unique, beautiful, and well story-lined.This is number one in my anime collection. Just about every bad review gotten for this movie was because of people who read the manga and therefor had major bias since a movie will just about never be the way you pictured it would be from reading it.Joy, love and peace."
5,One of the better animes finally on DVD,"Assuming you have already seen or own the video. Battle Angle has a solid and engulfing storyline, although different from the manga. This anime deserves a place beside such cyber-anime classics as Ghost in the Shell and Bubblegum Crisis. The transfer to DVD was very well done. The interactive menue is easy to navigate and flows smothly. ADV has always put a noticable amount of effort in doing the english voice overs with talented voice actors. Amanda Winn-Lee does a great job with Gally wich makes the dubbed version as enjoyable as the Japanese version. This DVD will make a great addition to any anime collection."
5,I think it's worth it...,"Like the other reviewer, I saw Bon Voyage on MTV in Germany in 2000. I loved it (especially the bouncing green Mustang, the ""Green Monsta"") so I wanted to buy it. And, that I did. I enjoy this cd, as well as groups such as Rammstein and Kraftwerk. I actually don't usually like rap, but this is good."
4,Everything you'd want from a sequel.,"This game improves on everything the original does wrong. It features awesome battle sequences, action packed gameplay, and over the top special effects. This is the game that proves Hideo Kojima isn't just good at making Metal Gear games. Everyone should run out and buy it now because the M rating is bull. The game itself is basicaly a T, but the anime cut scenes have some blood, thats the only reason for the M so what are you waiting for, no excuses, buy it now!"
3,Short on game play,"All of the reviews praising the graphics and game control are dead on....however, I gave 3 stars because this game follows the increasingly disturbing trend of short game play. The game was over after about only 5 true hours of game play (some previews had promised up to 10--this is a vast overestimate). If you enjoyed the first version then you will probably enjoy this one. But be warned, this is a very short game--not worth the price(my advice, rent it or buy it used)."
5,WOW Amazing graphics and Great Action Packed Game,"WOW!!!! Amazing graphics the story line is ok, The camara angle for multiplayer is very interesting. Some what better than split screen. A must have for all PS2 peeps."
4,Good...,"It has eye-poping PS2 graphics, but all of the dialogue is in japanese. It looks very nice. More info is on the way."
4,Remastering Excellent ... a sure buy!,"All I can say is that this hits release has excellent re-mastering 'breathing' life into your favorite hits from Breathe, pun intended. There no comparing the remastered tracks on this release with those of the drab (in comparison) original CD release tracks. It's a sure buy for real fans of this fabulous band."
4,shipping to Europe and converting with itunes,"I guess most is said about the quality of the music, which remains a question of taste.I just wanted to add on two aspects:1.: Shipping to Europe (Germany) worked out although there are two things to consider.-The delivery estimate was not achieved, but the CD arrived 4 days later.-There is no chance to track the package, I gues my money would have been lost, hadn't arrived the CD.2. There were no problems to convert the CD into an ipod-format by using a relatively new Mac.I hope this info might help for further purchasers.(I don't give full stars because I agree with previous reviewers that 12 songs are not enough for a CD called best of)"
5,CDReviewer,I love every song on this CD and cannot stop listening to them! It's the best CD I have ever gotten.
4,Great for a small framed mom!,"I originally bought the Deluxe Backpack by Babytrend (same price, great quality!) which turned out to be too long for me, a 5'3"" mom. I returned it and got this pack which is a much better fit for me, but can still accomodate my 5'11"" husband.There are a couple of features the other pack had that I wish this one had: 2 bottle holders on the sides and a second zipper compartment on the back. However, this pack is very light, adjustable and functional."
2,Major typos,I purchased this book due to a strong recommendation from a dear friend. I didn't realize there was another version of this book with no typos. Bummer. I should have gotten the one with the red cover instead.The Magic of Believing
5,The Magic of Believing,This audio CD has everything you need to be successful in life. Listen to it over and over until the messages sink into your subsconscious mind!
3,The Magic of Believing,"This is a CD of a book. It has a secular bent on the basis of all spiritual work which is ""belief."" It is an interesting read and can help focus your understanding regardless of where you attach your believing..."
5,Highly Recommened for Open Minded People,"Mr. Bristol shares some very powerful principles of how we interact with The Universe. If you're new to metaphysics you may not get his message right away. I'm on my third reading in about 10 years and, like an onion, new layers of myself are being revealed to myself...very stimulating."
4,Inspirational words from the past which still do the job!,"Claude Bristol's ""classic"" inspirational/psychology book is a quick read which will you to reinforce your personal power of positive thinking. A lot of is dated, but his tips & tricks are well presented, easy to emulate and time tested. Definitely worth a read and even a re-read when you are pursuing your life goals or desiring to shake up your world for the better."
5,the essence of success,"Many books have been written on success, but this book condenses the wisdom of all of them. Bristol talks about suggestion, visualization, the mirror technique and telepathy. All success books use this in one form or another. The instructions are practical and they do work. You must be persistant at these techniques, perhaps for years, but they do work and bring astounding results. Bristol gives case histories of the use of these techniques that are very enlightening. I have read of other uses of it. Hunter Davies wrote a book about the Beatles and he quoted Paul McCartney as saying that anyone can be a success if he tells himself this often enough. Hard work is essential of course, but suggestion is certainly a most powerful assistant."
5,Definitely worthwhile....,"Yes, it's true, there's a lot of extra stuff here, and the techniques could have been condensed to a smaller number of pages, but the book does have some amazing and useful things in it. Especially the mirror technique. I knew intuitively that it was true and powerful when I read it, and it has proven to be so. You can probably skim through the book in a few hours and highlight some really useful stuff, (or read it and get a feeling of a self-development book from 1948 is like. It's actually a kinda sweet and positive book). At the low mass-market paperback price it's worth it..."
3,Very Repetitive,"I found this book to be very repetitive. It's a 189 page book that could've EASILY be shortened to a 50 page book (or even less). But the principles are essential to success! You will learn the power of belief and the different manners in which belief occurs (i.e. mirror technique, mental pictures, etc).I guess for someone who has never been introduced to these concepts, the extra pages are necessary, so if you're someone who doesn't believe in belief, or you just don't know how to apply it, or maybe you just want to read more about it, buy the book."
2,"Yeah, yeah","Heard all this before. The Law of Attraction, positive visualization, etc. etc. As a Man Thinketh. Easy to say, hard to do, especially for pessimistic and skeptical people like me. But it's worth a try, nothing to lose and everything to gain. Some of Bristol's stuff is pure hokum, much like the Secret and all that nonsense. Sells alot of books though!"
1,the magic of wasting your money,"The entire book could have been condensed into 4 pages. There are alot of better self-improvement books available that can actually help you. Don't waste your time on this antiquated, silly nonsense."
3,Real Magic?,"I apologize for the off topic nature of this post, but after reading this book I never got the impression that this was witchcraft magic though I did see a mentioning of black and white magic. I thought that was given as an example. None of the techniques in here (visualizations, mirror technique) seemed ""magic""/magick/witchcraft to me. Am I wrong here? Is this REALLY witchcraft?I also read ""The Power of your Subconscious Mind"" and Murphy never spoke of magic/magick/witchcraft.Please someone rely as to whether or not this is the occult practice or not. Thank you."
5,Personal Development,"This particular audio CD is extremely powerful tool in developing ones personal goals for any worthy ideal. I would suggest if you own a copy, listen to itAsk & It Is Givenover and over again. You wont regret it."
5,HOW BADLY DO YOU WANT IT ?,"I chose this rating because I have been on a never ending quest to break the chains that bind me and that keep from from achieving what I know deep down inside me, I can achieve. Out of the dozens of self help courses and books that I have purchased over the years, this one book was by far the best. It does not dwell on vaque wishes and dreams that most of the us will never trully realize, but is a road map of specifics that literally show you how to achieve what you want. It's not easy by any means,but what is easy that is worth having. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a burnig desire to better themselves and is willing to do what is suggested in this amazing piece of literature."
5,Life Changing Book~!,"I want to buy this book for everyone~! As it is now, I will buy it for my nieces at the very least. The message is brilliant and clear with constructive methods to use to change your life. These work quickly and I'm thrilled to find someone else who thinks of the law of attraction like the law of gravity or the existence of electricity - scientific. Bristol's other book TNT is also fantastic and I am halfway through it. If you already believe and do not ""need evidence"" you may want to jump right to TNT."
2,This review is for the AUDIO BOOK.,"o.k., o.k., o.k....I know I should have read the fine print. But as a huge fan of the book, I was VERY disappointed to learn that the audio book is an abridged version.And in my opinion, VERY abridged.Too bad the whole book isn't on audio, as it would make a great car ride listen.I agree with another reviewer that it takes a few reads to take in this great piece of work. But when the whole thing isn't on audio...it obviously doesn't matter if you listen several times or not, because a bunch of the good stuff is missing!But as far as the book goes...highly recommended."
4,Inspiring,I am half way threw the book and it's very inspiring. I'm trying to be more positive about things.
4,I believe in magic... I really do,"The Magic of Believing seems to be ahead of its time....I find it to be amazing that it was written so long ago.I love the old time feel of it... It feels tried and true.I find similar teachings from great teachers of today like-John Assaraf-Michael Beckwith-James A. RayI found the audio both inspirational and entertaining, I love the real life examples that Claude Bristol uses to demonstrate the validity of his theory.This book also encourages you to examine (imagine) history from the THOUGHTS BEHIND THE FACTS and not from a facts and dates point of view.Use this audio as entertainment or inspiration... either way it will get you re-examine the your world and your life.I totally recommend it!Carletus Willis[...]"
2,Disappointing,"I read by the same author his other book TNT - THE POWER WITHIN YOU, and I was so impressed with that particular book, that I didn't hesitate to order a copy of THE MAGIC OF BELIEVING.However, I was very unimpressed with this book. It seems to be more of a collection of essays on the power of belief, rather that a practical how-to-do book. It also does seem quite repetitive in its message and approach.Personally I found TNT - THE POWER WITHIN YOU to be a much more exciting and dynamic book. It has an abundance of varied information and advice, and also benefits massively from the writing style of co-author Harold Sherman.My suggestion is don't bother with THE MAGIC OF BELIEVING. Go straight from TNT - THE POWER WITHIN YOU. This book covers everything that is in the first, but also a lot more."
2,Magic of Believing Review,"Excellent book. However, if the print were any smaller, I'd need a magnifying glass!"
5,I'm a believer,"The gentleman who wrote this book died back in 1951, but the subject matter is just as pertinent today as it was in 1948 when he wrote it. I give the CD 4 stars and the book 5 -- you'll want to read it more than once and listen to the CD more than once to really get everything from it. It's a little vague in some ways, and sometimes you may think ""come on, just spit it out already!"" but if you pay attention, it's worth a whole lot more than you'll pay for it. It really *can* help you change your life.I'm confused how an earlier reviewer found it to be mysticism or something that he felt went against Christian/religious principles -- I happen to be a Christian myself and I firmly believe Dr. Van Peale was right on the money when he recommended the book.Belief -- faith, if you will -- is the cornerstone of any success. If you read any sort of motivational (self-help) literature, you'll find a common theme because that's what it all comes back to: belief."
4,great book for kids who like blues clues and hide and seek,"My son is two and he loves this book because it has Steve, Blue and a bunch of toys in it. It's interactive for kids because they have to turn the light ""on and off"" and find Blue in the dark and figure out which toy has been put away in the toy box. It helps kids find the missing toys as well as learn how to put away toys. Tanner usually asks to read it once a day!"
2,enough already,"Ok, we all know toddlers just love blue. But this book isn't well written. My two yr old tires of them easily, and she loves books. So, its says alot when she is sick of something, as well as myself. Don't get me wrong, if it takes a favorite character as an incentive to read, buy this book. If you want a book to enjoy for years to come, a book that will last in memory, buy another book."
2,"Good point, bad points","Maybe my son is just too young to understand the book, but the only thing he likes about the book is that when he touches the light switch the pages turn. As for naming the toys and noticing where they are, he has no interest. Of course, he is only 18 months old. I think that part of the problem is that every page looks alike, with only one toy out of place. The changes are not really obvious, so to him the book is boring. Blue is his favorite character and I am sure he will continue to look at the book. It's just not one of his favorites."
5,best... band... EVER!!!,"Basically, these guys rule. They tend to be a little softer than my usual taste but they pull it off because of great lyrics, harmonies, and guitar solos. Their lead a guitarist blows my mind and the baseline is wonderfully powerful. This album will definately keep your head shakin'. The singer is well, a bad .... Amazing range and soul (he is really into what he is singing).I have had the pleasure of seeing Plan-R live as well. On stage they sound EXACTLY like they do on the CD, something that is rare these days. Buy this album so you can be one of the people years down the road that says, ""I've been a fan since the beginning"". You may even impress some chick with such talk."
2,Reality,"I am a music guy, so I bought the dvd based on Beth's contribution to the last Les Paul cd and reviews of her work.What a disappointment! The show (dvd visuals) were good, but where was the originality? She is not this years, or any years, Janis Joplin.She has her style, I hope she can build on it."
5,"Beth Hart Definitely ""Lifts you Up""!!!","I first heard Beth Hart on a morning radio show (Mark & Brian)while driving home after working all night. She was singing in the studio and being interviewed. I was amazed. I sat in my driveway until it was over, then went on Amazon and bought her available cds. When Amazon sent me an email for the DVD I immediately pre ordered it. IT'S AWESOME. If ever someone was ""born"" to do something, Beth was born to perform. If you doubt this just look in her eyes after coming off stage after singing I Don't Need No Doctor during the bonus rockumentary portion. Incredible! She has a top notch band supporting her. She'll bring tears to your eyes, she'll make you smile, she'll give you everything she's got."
5,Power PassionEnergyTalent,Beth Hart rules...excellent show for real rock fans...brilliant songs...exceptional production...great band...and Beth Hart's raw talent...the live performances captured here prove that this woman is an incredible performer/musician...if you're not familiar with Beth Hart...don't waste your time/money with phony talent...the real thing is here...
5,Thank you for finally making a DVD,"My family has been watching her career since her early days on ""Star Search"" here in America oh about maybe 8 years ago. She wiped out her competition then just as she does now on this DVD. We have seen her preform in various places here in Florida, she always puts on a great show. We highly advise getting this if you like energy and emotion in music...stay away from if you are into the bubble gum crap thats on American radio."
3,It's a crime drama.,"If you're looking for action here, you'll be disappointed. There are some killing scenes but they do not contain big explosions or kung fu fighting. If you like character development, psychology, betrayal and twisted plots, you'll like this movie.It's worth watching."
1,Johnnie To's worst,"I am a fan of Johnnie To but this is my least favorite film of his I have seen so far. Nothing happens and this is about as boring as a movie could be. Louis Koo is hardly in this film, but it sets up his character for the sequel.I am not sure why so many people seemed to enjoy this film.I would recommend Triangle instead, in which To directed the last third of which is very entertaining."
3,...Jim saved 'em,"I'm astounded by all the reviews that suggest it takes a while to ""get"" this album (maybe so, if you're so used to listening to Britney Spears that your gentle ears can't handle anything other than an A-B-A-B-C song structure).Because of their boring conventionality, Wilco slinked by unnoticed and unworthy until Jim O'Rourke took pity on them and taught Jeff how to arrange a song in those crazy, newfangled ways of his. New convert Jeff is now coming up with equally crazy stuff like Loose Fur...I guess Wilco fans are going to have to get used to listening more than once to decide if they like an album or not (actual thinking may be required)!Quit listening to your Zebra (!!!!!) albums over and over again and challenge yourselves!!PS...Anyone who thinks David Lee Roth is still relevant and Zebra was ever any good shouldn't be allowed to write reviews"
4,lotta hype,"this album was attatched to every single music search that I did so i finally bought it expecting this absolute masterpiece of a thing, up there with Sgt. Pepper's and stuff. The first time i listened to it, I only liked the Heavy Metal Drummer. But then the more i listned to it the more i knew what to expect and i could be in the right mood for it. ONe thing that's really just buggin me is how so many people are putting down the electronic buzzing and hissing and humming noises, and it's true that this is not as album where you just listen to a few songs, you have to listen to the whole thing all the way through and then the electronic stuff fits into it's place."
1,morons,"if you people hated the album so much, then why did you write a review. You obviously care enough about it to do something."
2,Zzzzzzz,"Dear Jeff (Tweedy),Please WRITE A NEW SONG. Every single Wilco album recycles the same freakin' songs, with just more and more production noodling thrown on top every time. (oh, and please stop ripping off Pet Sounds) Don't get me wrong, it's a great song, but for the love of god, give us something new. After reading the reviews for this I figured you guys must have broken out of your slump, but sadly, you are still wallowing in the muck of Summerteeth. or was it the first one? Or maybe that other thing. Crap, I forget. Oh well, I'm going to go listen to some Uncle tupelo and pretend you never happened. Thank god for file sharing or I might have actually wasted my hard earned dinero."
1,It isn't good,I don't know why this group is rated so high on the amazon charts. the guy can't sing. He has raspy voice. The music is such that you can't sing with it or dance to it. I guess I am too uncool to get it.
5,bought 2,"I stole/downloaded this CD months ago, and to repay wilco I bought 2 copies. it sounds even better now. it was worth the wait for a great band.buy 2 -- turn on a friend.p.s. waiting for wilco to tour florida...."
5,Best Album of the Year (or maybe many years)!,"This is simply a great album that gets better with every listen. Ignore all the reviews trying to compare Yankee Hotel Foxtrot to anything else. Just turn it up and enjoy. You have to love the fact that Wilco's record label wanted nothing to do with this masterpiece and sent the band packing. The contiuning evolution of Jeff Tweedy from Uncle Tupelo to early Wilco to YHF has been a great ride. I can't imagine them ever topping this album, but I've said that about Tweedy before!"
4,Good album,"I listen to this album at work a lot. Some really great songs. A few are eclectic, but overall a quality album."
4,A cure for radio.,"I don't know if I can call this the masterpiece of 2002 that others have, but it is extremely good. It does take a few listens to really appreciate though. All the songs I like, but my favorites are ""Kamera"", ""War on War"", ""Jesus, etc."", and of course ""Heavy Metal Drummer"". I can relate to that song, because I've seen a few bands on the riverfront in St. Louis myself. This doesn't sound too much like the ""Jeff Tweedy"" we knew from ""Uncle Tupelo"", but it will go great with the recent ""Beck"" and ""Flaming Lips"" albums."
5,Best album so far this year,"""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"" is the best album I have heard this year and the best album Wilco has ever made. It is a perfect mix of catchy roots-rock melodies and gorgeous experimental ballads. In fact, after 9-11, two of the songs on this album, ""Ashes of American Flags"" and ""Jesus, etc."", take on a poignant air. Take these lyrics and see if you catch my drift: 'Tall buildings shake/voices escape singing sad sad songs.'But this album has its fun moments. ""Heavy Metal Drummer"", ""War on War"" and ""I am the Man who loves You"" are three of the catchiest songs the band has ever recorded.I like what the Editorial Review (above) has to say. Comparing the album to ""some wonderful pop station punctuated by static and sonic bleed"" is very thoughtful and true.""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"" should be in everyone's record collection and is a great album.Good night and thank you for your time."
1,Talk about overrated! Music is terrible!,"I purchased this CD solely on the strength of reviews here, and actually listened to it twice. Like some previous reviewers here, I must say I just don't get it either! How many seem think this band is a modern day musical marvel is beyond me! The songs are too plain, uninspired, and most certainly not well written. In fact, they are downright boring and un-memorable. But, considering how today's youth arguably has [worse] music to listen to than previous generations, it doesn't surprise me that they would like this Wilco release. Music is getting worse and worse these days."
1,Not even worth 10 dollars,"I've given this cd many listens, but I just don't like it. It sounds somewhere in between Pavement's <i>Terror Twilight</i> and Doves' <i>Last Broadcast</i>, both of which were far and away, much better albums. I do not approve."
1,Huh?,"I bought this CD based on several 5 star reviews by other listeners. I'm sorry, but I don't get it. Or maybe I'm just dropping the wrong kind of acid. I just don't really enjoy listening to a drunken Bob Geldof straining his vocal cords singing along to the sounds of a short-wave radio. On the bright side, I was able to unload it to a ""fan"" of the band."
1,Detour,"Who compared this insipid pop-band to the Norwegian Royksopp??? I guess my review is for the band itself: If you are a Royksopp or a Boards of Canada fan and you ended up here for some strange reason please save yourself some time , this isn't for you....by absolutely no means. Let me help you find your way back: Lemongrass, Plaid, etc..."
2,Very Uneven...,"This album has been overhyped. It is a really mixed bag... I think track 3 is amazingly good, and the rest ranges from tolerable to a total loss. Buying the whole album is a waste of money, in my opinion. Be selective and save yer pennies..."
2,Too much thinking,"The words ""self-indulgent,"" ""pretentious,"" and ""self-conscious"" come to mind. It's like going to a lecture on a Saturday night; no fun. I don't feel the need to appreciate this CD on repeated listenings simply because every rock critic tells me I should. Wilco has run their course. Time to form a new band."
1,maybe I don't get it...,"First let me say that I like Wilco, I liked Summer Teeth, I liked AM, I liked Being There. I like Uncle Tupelo. I like Son Volt.I just don't like this album. People have said that you need several listens to unravel the mysteries of the album to truly appreciate it - and maybe that is true. I just can't get through the requisite four or five listens - this music is just horribly unenjoyable. There is nothing fun or catchy here. Other ""complicated"" albums gave me reasons to return to them, gave me reasons to listen repeatedly as the album grew on me- like the electronic/Marching Band sound of the title track on ""Kid A"". YHFT doesn't - nothing here is anything I would like to revisit. Music is supposed to be fun, and this just isn't."
5,Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,"Possibly the most famous album with a back story released in 2002, and one that gave a record companies a bad name once and for all, Wilco's oft-maligned ""experiment"" is a smart, daring, complete work of art. Somewhat ironically, but very fittingly, their most successful one as well. Say what you want about the electronic noises (I was expecting so much more!), but this album has some of Wilco's strongest songs."
5,Worth the wait...,"There are not enough words to describe how perfect this album is. When my friends ask me what it's like, I just say, ""everything"". Listen carefully and you will find the Beatles mingling with Radiohead, while Bob Dylan is brooding in the corner. It is more than anyone thought they could achieve, and is worth every penny.So far, it is easily the best album of 2002."
5,Beyond Amazing,"Normally I am most sparing in my praise, but this work (and it deserves the noun) is beyond amazing. Indescribably beautiful, inspiring and courageous. How to begin to do it justice? Take the Beatles (White Album vintage), the Dead, Bob Dylan, combine with the musical daring and sophistication of ... Stravinsky? The poetic soul of ... Denis Johnson? Put it all together seamlessly, as pure as ... damn, I've run out of words. Just listen to it."
5,Wilco's best album and their most accessible - this is a winner!,"Wilco has made many good albums before ""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"", but this one is truly their breakthrough. The majority of songs here are catchy, memorable, and musically/lyrically interesting which is a very hard thing to achieve. Singer Jeff Tweedy is definitely on his game here, and a lot of the pieces seem pretty original. It's mostly a very soothing and mellow album. The lyrics, especially, are pretty good. If you weren't a fan because of Wilco's previous albums I think this'll make you one. As for its sound, it tends to vary - it can be fast at times but it's mostly slow and emotional. A very satisfying album for Wilco fans and I think a great new direction for the band. Most people should love it. Highly recommended!Highlights include:""I Am Trying To Break Your Heart""""Kamera""""Radio Cure""""War On War""""Jesus, Etc.""""Ashes Of American Flags""""Heavy Metal Drummer""""Pot Kettle Black"""
2,Get back to the basics,"Dear Jeff,Forget all the bells and whistles and please get back to what you do best. FLAT OUT ROCK. If I want stoner music I will listen to Pink Floyd or even BECKS new album, which is a far better listen then this snooze.."
2,wotz all this then,"I, like some other reviewers, have tried to like this album. It has been in the cd player of my car for the past week and,well,uhI dunno...I just don't get it. It seems sometimes that artists just try too damn hard to sound indy and bury any decent song in a sludgy(and probably expensive) production. ... Of course, taste is subjective but this thing just bores me to death."
2,most over-rated album of the 21st Century!,"Don't get me wrong, this isn't a terrible album, but as a professional musician and songwriter, I don't hear the ""greatness"" in this album, that so many people seem to proclaim. It's interesting and has some innovative approaches to some of the songs, but overall it doesn't hold up. You can definitely hear the Jay Bennett influence versus the Jeff Tweedy sections. I have to agree with the Warner execs who said that the album wasn't commercial,but I'll go further and say it isn't particularly good. In a year or two this copies of this album will infest the used CD bins, and in five years the few people who remember this album, will wonder what the big fuss was about."
2,I just don't get it,"I bought this CD after reading all the great reviews and hearing all the hype about it. Ever since, I've been listening to it over and over, trying to figure out what people find so great about it. I'd advise you to download some of the songs first and decide for yourself. Like another reviewer said, don't buy into the hype."
2,Forgettable Hype of 2002,"As with The Strokes ""Is This It?"" in 2001, Wilco has been blessed as the magazines' ""Critics Darling of 2002"" award thus far this year. In an era of younger music fans who are constantly force-fed corporate-bred McMusic, it's no wonder that so many listeners simply accept something different as their gold. The music and vocals on this album are sub-par. If you want to hear a good ""alt-country-rock album,"" try Crosby Stills Nash and Young's ""Deja Vu."" Save your money on this garbage. If you want something similar to this in a much better ingredient form, try ""Harvest"" by Neil Young, ""Dry"" by PJ Harvey, or Pavements ""Slanted and Enchanted.""Over and out ..."
2,I've tried,"Over a decade ago, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was my first exposure to Wilco. I listened over and over, trying to reconcile my discomfort with the critical accolades. Couldn't do it. In fact, this album turned me off to the band for a long time.Flash forward. Wilco is now easily one of my Top 10 favorite bands of all time. I adore the late (The Whole Love) and the early (Being There) and frequently listen to everything in between. But YHF? Still no. My least favorite in their catalog.I still try every few months, as some of the songs have a lot of promise. But they remind me of Altman's film ""Popeye"" - songs start off well enough, then sink down a druggy, self-absorbed hole. Thumbs down.Can't understand the enduring raves. Listen to Wilco, if you haven't. Start anywhere but here."
1,Why all the hype?,"I have given this album a half-a-dozen listens in the hope that I could find something of value here. Nope!The rating system is 1 - 5 stars or I would have given this a well deserved negative rating as it is just not good enough for a zero.Innovative? Give me a break! Yoko Ono, Radiohead, Bjork, King Crimson and many others are innovative. These guys just sound incoherent, lacking in talent and overly stoned.I will say this though, if I ever have a serious case of insomnia I will take this CD out from under the half-full glass on my coffee table and give it a spin. I should be asleep in no time."
2,"Ok, Ok","AM - Wilco tries to be the Stones. They're not the stones, they're not Gram Parsons, but so what I've heard all the stones songs and all the Gram Parsons songs a million times. I wanna hear something slightly different, but the same if ya know what I mean. Good, but to play when I'm so sick of the originals.Being There - Same as AM review, but slightly more experimental. It could have been interesting, but its not. Some more killer stonesy songs however.Summertime - Abandoned the stones/Gram for the Beatles/Brian Wilson sound. I actually like it better. It's no less derivative, but I do like it better than their stones rip-offs.YHF - White Album??????? I like it, but then my wife started to like it too and I started to get really sick of it. Definately a beatles rip-off. The more experimental stuff doesn't quite work cause Tweedy isn't really a musician. He can't pull off like the Beatles/George Martin/Brian Wilson/etc. Its enjoyable."
1,Not for fans of ROCK,"Well I heard these guys were influenced by country music so it was a relief to hear this album and find no fiddles or banjos but I've still gotta give it only one star because there's still no ROCK on it. There's some electronic bleeps for a while and it sounds like the rock may come but it rarley does. When it does it stops just as suddenly. When finally HEAVY METAL DRUMMER roles around its not heavy at all :( Instead it sounds like pop. Plus the solos are out of tune when they crop up at all. As a fan of rock music like Poison, Ratt or Cinderella I was very dissappointed with this release and do not recommend it to rock fans at all. Buy only if you want an album to put you to sleep."
1,where's the...bag?,hard to believe records companies are spending millons of dollarsto prevent coping this stuff!Not worth the plastic it's burned on
1,soft,"Wilco is basically just a really soft band that could use a bit more pep if you ask me. I tend to like soft music just fine, but the songs on this CD simply don't have good melodies to offer. If you happen to like Wilco anyway in spite of my review, check out Golden Smog, because they're similar to Wilco but infinitely better. P.S. The cover art is the best part."
1,Flat and Recycled,"Every time I hear the claim that a CD is new and ground breaking I normally find it sounds like a slightly modern version of The Beatles Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band. This CD is no exception. There's really nothing new about this album, everything they do is recycled from ambient music and Radiohead. But maybe my biggest complaint is that Tweedy is not a strong vocalist and his flat delivery kills any life this CD may have had."
4,Worth the Wait,"To those of you unfamiliar with Wilco, they are truly one of America's greatest bands. Jeff Tweedy is nothing short of a genius. YHF features hauntingly beautiful songs that are mostly dark and ofttimes forboding - both lyrically and instrumentally. There's not a trace of the alt/country sound that worked so well in Being There. They've also jettisonned mush of the dissonance and distortion that creeps into their albums and is featured in their live performances, instead giving the melodies and lyrics the spotlight. None of these songs will ever be classics, but this is definitely the band's most consistent and complete effort to date. You may not love it on first listen, but it will grow on you and I can't imagine any serious listener feeling that the purchase was not money well spent."
5,A brilliant cd - worthy of its critical acclaim,"I kept seeing the title of this cd appear repeatedly on ""Best Of"" lists. I finally wanted to see what all of the hype was about and went out and bought it. And now I'm sorry that I didn't pick this up earlier - I could have been enjoying it all year. It's truly a brilliant album. I keep reading that most people have to listen to it repeatedly before they enjoy it. I've got to say that I loved it the first time I heard it. After the first time I listened to it, I wanted to go back for more - and ended up listening to it a few times. I haven't done that to a cd in a long time. Pick it up - you won't be sorry."
5,The first time I teared up at a listening station,"Can't believe I waited so long to listen to the whole album (also done at said local listening station: I was completely entranced). Yes, the willful dissonance can be disconcerting at first -- this even to an erstwhile fan of electronic ""noise"" bands from the '70s and '80s -- but in the end this music is beautiful, haunting, redemptive stuff. Hats off to Wilco for refusing to compromise and to Nonesuch for making this brilliant album available."
3,A fine pop album -- in spots.,"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot has some of the catchier pop songs I've heard in quite some time. My advice for those wondering whether to believe the hype about this album is this: Happier is better than sad. Therefore, when you listen to this CD, program it to play these songs only:KameraWar on WarHeavy Metal DrummerI'm The Man Who Loves YouPot Kettle BlackThat said, I believe Wilco's at their very best when they lighten up and smile. Note to Jeff Tweedy: There's nothing wrong with writing a whole album's worth of good, simple, toe-tapping pop songs. That's High Art, too. Four Englishmen who called themselves the Beatles did it awfully well.There's no need for Jeff Tweedy and Jay Bennett to write such pretentious dreck as Ashes of American Flags just for pointy-headed critics, especially in light of the five seemingly effortless pop gems that grace this CD. Have some more fun, Wilco!"
3,"I liked it, I did not love it","I think Wilco is a great band. I thought this CD did not live up to the hype that proceeded it. I found the previous Wilco albums to be so much better.That being said, if you are a Wilco fan, you should get this album"
5,You Have To Support This With Your $s!,"A monumental album. Seamless, beautiful & cohesive. Raging with unbelievable commitment, focus & purpose.It has not left my system since it was released, and every time I play it I feel like I am hearing it for the first time. You have to listen to this album over and over and over again, more than any previous Wilco effort.But sooner, rather than later, there will come a listen when it will just explode into your concienceness.And seem as if it has always been there.And it will become as natural and ""of course"" and as great as St. Peppers or Blonde On Blonde or Astral Weeks or ... well that could go on and on...It is brilliant. It is a masterpiece.People who give this level of themselves to us deserve to be supported for it.If you care about music, you must buy this album.It's that simple.Tom Bjornsen tjbjornsen@earthlink.net"
5,best album of the year,"I am not one to mince words, this is by far the the best album of the year so far by an american artist.In my humble opinion.Well done, Wilco."
1,Rotten vegetables,This sounds like a mixture of Pavement and Burt Bacharach. Stay away from this like the plague!
1,Reprise had it right! This is pretty bad!,"I thought I would hold out until I went to the concert to do this review, and after seeing Wilco here in Chicago last week, I can truthfully post this. It was without a doubt the WORST concert I have every seen, and this CD may be the worst in my collection. Except for 'Heavy Metal Drummer', this CD drones on and on in a single chord monotone that has me reaching for the razor blades. Skip this one at all costs.The only decent CD Wilco has put out in 'AM', so if you really want something from this band, get that one."
1,"Too much Hype, no substance","I too believed all the hype of this being ""the first classic album of the year"". Could not wait to get my hands on it and they suffered through a disappointing effort of dark droning and sub-par effort. Stay away!"
1,Pathological offkey wanking,"I really wanted to like this album. Being an audiophile wannabe, I read all the critics' reviews and really expected a treat. I like straight-on songs without meandering meaningless intros. YHF does not fulfill on this criterion. I'm not sure what the long, boring 1 minute plus intros seek to achieve - other than provide a contrast for the approximately 4 songs that are catchy and listenable on this album. It seems like we are being set-up for audio torture for the bulk of this album and the few redeeming songs provide such relief that we are fooled into thinking this is really a work of ""genius"". Maybe Tweedy should have fired himself as a singer and hired someone who has a decent voice. Get someone to burn cuts 3,7,8 and 9 and trash the rest."
3,Weak Sauce,"Plenty of hooks, but no catch. The best moments come from when they sound like a pastiche of their noted influences. More time seems to have been spent on the electronic garnish than actually writing good songs, and ultimately neither of these elements are very interesting. Tweedy's voice is irritating, and the honest yet depressingly formulaic lyrics don't help. What troubles me is how devoid of emotion is--when I listen to YHF, I feel nothing. I don't care about this album at all."
2,"Throwing it all away... wasted genius, etc.","Take one of the great human voices (Tweedy) and bury it in the mix, slather digital effects and artsy EQ all over it. Take one of the great songwriters of the last ten years & let him write lyrics that are strings of nonsensical ""associations"". Take a great band & break it apart. Fire it's soul. You get this self indulgent, largely unlistenable album. Hey, I love this band & I'll stick with them through almost anything, but this finds them seeking a cool factor... critical acclaim going to their heads.I love it when bands take chances, try new directions, and I give them credit for that, but this album is just not very good. I want to hear Jeff sing, I want to hear harmonies, I want to hear great musicianship and brilliant lyrics. The noise is interesting & cool, but without the rest it will just sit on the shelf instead of in the CD player.Nothing lasts forever..."
2,I don't get it,"I have heard nothing but rave reviews of this CD-and as an open-minded music fan I decided to give it a shot. I listened to the entire CD, waiting and waiting for it to start to be wonderful, and that time just never came. Maybe this is one of those CDs that needs a few listens, but the fact is there are way too many other CDs I would rather listen to than this one, so I may never know. As for (seemingly) everyone else in the world who loves this CD and can't get over its brilliance and greatness, I'm happy for you, but I honestly can't see the merits of this album."
2,Music to have a Bad Trip by...,"I really enjoyed Wilco's recordings with Billy Bragg and ""AM"" but this one is way undercooked for songs with meaning and musicians that can play, and overcooked with effects and garbled ""I always wanted to be a Beatle"" type retro wanking. Did I buy this to hear a drummer try his best to sound like Ringo Starr (listen to track one to see what I mean)? Tweedy's vocals are dull and the words he sings are just as uninspiring. Skip this one unless you like throwing away money. I made better music in elementary band class then is on this CD."
2,BORING,"I just finished by first (and probably last) listen to this CD. I am not a musician. I don't care about technique or ""sonic adventurism"" or experimentalism etc. The ""sonic bleed of competing signals"", the ""cathartic squall of distortion"" don't do anything for me, mainly because they sound like they've just be added in order to make the songs more interesting given the lead sings hushed bland delivery. Although the songs without all the sonic garnish added a somewhat more listenable, they still put me to sleep. This album might ""demand, and reward, repeated listens"", but if there's nothing in the first listen to make you want to hear it again, why should I force myself to endure it again."
1,Yawn,"Best album of 2002?? Yawn, this is awful. Boring, trite, and well yes again, boring. ZZZZZZZZZZ!"
1,Complete waste of money,"Short and sweet - don't buy this CD. I was expecting somewhat better than Summer Teeth, which I thought deserved one of the best albums of 1999. I kept anticipating a song that had some melody, words that meant something. Instead I got cutsy noises and totally ""me"" lyrics, most of the time making no sense whatsoever. Oh, please."
2,I thought my headphones were broken!,"Okay, I get what's going on here, the static and other annoying sounds are supposed to simulate a radio broadcast. Big deal! Taking average songs and adding annoying sounds to each track doesn't make them extraordinary."
1,What's all the fuss about?,"How about some decent lyrics...consistantly? Also the melody lines sound like what you would sing when you've got a few chords down and are first making up a verse or chorus, not a final product. A bunch of weird noises + dumb lyrics + singing like your hungover laying in bed = great music for some I guess. There are a few decent moments, but nothing a million garage bands couldn't duplicate in 5 minutes. Maybe my perspective is different than most because I record bands all the time and have done a few albums myself."
2,How someone can give this 5 stars.......,"....is beyond me. Now I like Wilco. Summerteeth is a great album, basically everything up until this terrible album was very good. Maybe this album wouldn't be so terrible if the horrible song ""heavy metal drummer"", was not on here. In fact, that song is so terrible it should not have been made. I am sorry to those who love this album, but I just can't get into it. There are a few scattered tracks on here that keep me from giving it a worse rating than 2 stars. Maybe this album would be good if you were used to listening to really crappy music for an exstensive period of time and than discovered that coldplay is a really sad excuse of a band, and you put away your interpol cd's because you finally realized that they are a joy division ripoff but way worse. Than maybe YHFT would be a good album to you, but Wilco could, and has done alot better than this."
3,Still Liked it,It's seems especially hip to like this due to the heavy press it's gotten for not being released by their record comapny....Still a few good songs though. For my money the first Mermaid Avenue is the best work Wilco has done.
2,Roger Wilco,"I greatly anticipated the release of this album. I totally fell in love with Summerteeth. It seemed Jeff Tweedy was on the top of his game. But with this outing, it seems Tweedy has forsaken listenabilty in favor of distorted guitar feedback,white noise, and studio loops, etc... I feel it was overdone, and it took away from what could have been there best album yet."
2,Dissenting Opinion,"I read all the great reviews. I've had a copy Wilco's ""Being There"" for years and still play it. So I was really surprised at how little I enjoyed ""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"". To me, it just ""missed"". I don't really know how else to describe it. A lot of the songs seemed to have promise, but none of them seemed to fulfill it. I tried replaying it many times, over a period of months, but just couldn't find any reason to keep it in my player - I didn't like it at all. Finally had to sell it."
5,Probably one of the best albums ever made,"Wilco has created a masterpiece. It's hard to describe how good it is, so my advice is to PREVIEW it, and not steal it from a various music service. The songs are elgantly crafted, with jeff tweedy's depressed voice sounding better every time you listen to it. Buy now"
4,Deserves More than Many People give it,"...It IS different. But it's a great album. It's mellow, that's for sure. It's experimental, that's a given... It's goofy, but the experimentation is much what Wilco does on a lot of this album..."
5,One the Best of 2002,"At least the critics got it right on this one, even though the Grammys and the record company didn't. This is a CD that almost didn't get released, until Wilco bought it back from their former label and shopped it around. It's a brilliant CD whose style is hard to define... alternative-country-pop-folk. ""Heavy Metal Drummer"" is incredibly catchy, and ""Jesus, etc."" is my pick for best song of the year... the song still gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. Clearly, this CD is one of the best of 2002."
5,Only An Idiot Wouldn't Release This,"... Wilco have managed to create a CD that is simultaneously the most challenging work they've ever done but also containing some of their best hopes for the mainstream success their former label felt the album could never achieve. Tracks like ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart"" and ""Ashes of American Flags"" are not likely to be squeezed in-between the Goo Goo Dolls and Dave Matthews even on the hippest of rock stations but I'll be damned if ""Heavy Metal Drummer"" or ""Jesus, Etc."" couldn't find some airplay and/or VH1 exposure. People who know this band from their previous work will find a lot to enjoy here and newcomers, perhaps drawn in by the press surrounding this release, will get a chance to hear what music sounds like when art comes first and commerce is just an afterthought."
2,what the heck am i listening to??,"ok i bought this album along with Chelsea Walls on the release date, after one listen of Chelsea it went into my disc changer, after one listen to YHF it went into my back seat and i havent heard it since. Summer Teeth was a good album it mixed old with new, this..this album made me sad. At first i thought i put in my Better Than Ezra disc by mistake. But BTE pulled of weirdness and it sounded good, this album just sounds like junk junk and confused junk. This album just seems not to be worth the money. Go buy Chelsea Walls the remake of The Lonely One is beautiful. I dont agree with dling music from the net but save your money and dk YHF"
2,Pink Floyd on Qualudes,"That's the best quick description I can think of for this boring album. So many people recommended it to me that I went out and bought it without hearing a single track. Now I've listened all the way through a couple of times and I don't see what all the fuss is about. Take a lead singer with a deep, monotonous voice, some accoustic guitar, and combine them with meaningless lyrics and some sound effects that could have come from an early 1970's Pink Floyd album, and this is the result.On the other hand, the packaging was pretty nice - worth an extra star right there."
2,Disappointed Wilco Fan,"Yes, it is Beatlesesque. It seems contrived. It's Wilco's techno dance album. There was a double masterpiece called Being there, where there was great american songs, humable tunes you can't get out of your head, and beautiful guitar work. feedback and studio tricks cover up uncreative progressions in YHF. I admit I like war on war, for some reason its grown on me."
5,I love this record...,"I bought this album a week ago and I haven't listened to anything else since. The beautiful and catchy songs have worked their way into my brain, and I love it. I think this is one of Wilco's best efforts to date. The lyrics are thoughtful, and the melodies are haunting. For some reason, it just makes me feel good. Thank you, Jeff Tweedy & Co. for reaffirming that there's great new music out there to discover."
4,"Pretty darn great, despite the hype","Engaging and enjoyable collection of guitar pop that has its exuberant and pensive moments. The Conet-infused flurry of white noise at the end of ""Poor Places"" is my personal favorite moment, although ""Ashes of American Flags"" is another high point in my book. For someone who's never been into the ""Americana"" thing (I own a copy of Uncle Tupelo's genre-spawning debut, and that's it), I can't attest to the ""no depression"" factor (or lack thereof) of this album, but I do like it for what it is. That said, I had no idea just how much Jeff Tweedy sounds like Jerry Garcia (or even Stephen Malkmus) at times."
2,"Umm, okay...","Wilco was on its way (after A.M. and Being There) to becoming one of the best rock/roots rock bands in the world. They took a diversion with Billy Bragg down Mermaid Ave. to do justice to many pieces of Guthrie poetry by setting them to music...fine. They made a pretty pop record (Summerteeth)...okay. But this...well, the album itself is not without merit, but Tweedy and co. have gotten to the point where they're quirky for the sake of being quirky. Many of these tunes have potential, but get too caught up in being cute, and ""experimental,"" and...whatever. There's nothing, musically, on this disc that hasn't been done before. It all comes off as trite, self-aggrandizing, avant-look-at-me, condescending rubbish. Wilco's considerable talents would be best spent elsewhere..."
2,why all the hype?,"Tweedy and Farrar have been making great music for years. It appears as if they were better off together than apart. Each seems to be missing what the other has in abundance. This is a very uneven album - too few fantastic songs surrounded by overproduced guitar trackes with too much random noise. I find it jarring to listen to either through headphones or speakers. Seems as if every new noise/guitar trick that Wilco learned was included. I would have expected that on an early album. Here it just ruins good pop songs. The label story makes for great hype, but this disc didn't last long in the CD player."
5,YHF w/Bonus CD is worth the extra $$$,"For hardcore Wilco fans that need a fix until their next release, the bonus CD offers just what the junkie ordered. There are some experimental sounding tracks on here, which, like some on YHF, take a few listens to really start to appreciate. Alternatively, the best two tracks, A Magazine Called Sunset and Bob Dylan's 49th Beard, are instantly likable. Especially the former (Magazine), its lyrics and melody along with its Beatle-esque mellotron sound represent what is fast becoming Wilco's signature sound. BOTTOM LINE: If you love Wilco, this is a must have...especially if they're not planning on releasing it in the States."
3,The greatest album of all... week,"Is this the best album Wilco/Uncle Tupelo/Jeff Tweedy has produced, the masterpiece of our age, the album that puts Sgt. Pepper in its place with the Starland Vocal Band and Mac Davis? Uh... no. It's a typical modern bit of droning sensitive-singer-songwriter stuff, too nasal to be really pleasant, too much the same to be fully memorable. Not terrible (the Kinks-like ""Heavy Metal Drummer"" is quite good), but not noticeably better than, say, almost any High Llamas album. Why the hype, other than to flip off the record company that wouldn't release it? I really don't know."
1,I didn't know Wilco paid for shills.,"After reading such rave reviews by fellow amazonians i went out and bought Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Now i just wish the store would take it back. Apparently the cd i listened to (3 times thru) is not the same one everyone else did. I thought most of the songs sounded like a tabby cat being swung around by its tail. Tracks 4 and 5 were tolerable, but the rest were pretty [junky]. Of course this is just my opinion. But i suggest if you're a Wilco fan that you find another Wilco fan who already made the mistake of buying the cd and give it a listen first. I'd give you my copy, but i threw it out already."
2,A good effort for a stylistically lacking band,"I was not very familiar with the band Wilco (aside from some of their singles) before I bought ""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"". I decided to jump in after reading rave reviews for YHF. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. If you can get over the fact that this album sounds like ""Pavement Does Space Rock Volume 1"", (with special guests Urge Overkill on ""Kamera"", ""War on War"", ""Tea Kettle Black"" and Bob Dylan on ""Jesus, Etc."") *apologies if I just ruined those songs for you* - then it's palatable. Surely, ""Wilco's best album"" is probably fairly accurate. However, much of Wilco's fanbase are simply being introduced to new musical styles that they are not familiar with. For those who do not find Wilco's sound on YHF fresh and innovative, it is a simply mediocre album, not worth listening to more than a couple of times."
1,Boring,"Don't let these others hacks talk you into wasting money on this album. Its boring. There's no intricate sounds, amazing lyrics, etc... Its just plain boring."
1,It hurts my dog's ears too............,"This cd is a disappointment at best. I don't like all that ""metalic noise"" which some believe is actually music... I heard them on a Late Show and thought they sounded nice. Obviouslly, they were playing the only song on the cd that has any redeeming qualities. I don't like most of the music, it hurts my ears. If you like nice melody, harmony and rhythm this IS NOT the cd for you. I think if a cd is terrible, we should be able to return it for a full refund. That way, these so called ""Artists"" will know how we feel...Perhaps then, they would try harder. I gave them one star because they can play an instrument. (although that is questionable as well)"
2,wusses with keyboard noises,"the overall weakness of this album cannot be overstated. it is a lightweight and farcical little journey around Tweedys mind. if you want alt-country, check out Lucinda Williams, who really rocks. trite songwriting and noises abound on this disc, and though there are some strangely beautiful moments on a few songs, they don't last and don't boost up the songs that well. This is one of those albums that is ushering the now popular indie rock scene, which is very focused on looking cool, but not actually playing any good music and ""singing"" out of tune (or just babbling randomly). Thats all the lyrics are on this cd: babbleI would recommend just avoiding music like this. I would check out instead the Postal Service, Modest Mouse, and Death Cab For Cutie. At least they make more consistent effort."
3,Don't Believe the Hype,"This is my first Wilco disc. I know they are a critically acclaimed band and this disc has really been blown up. I bought this disc on the basis of the rave reviews it was getting from everyone. I must say, I am thoroughly disappointed. I have listened to the cd many times and find nothing ground breaking or moving. The first song is a good song as well as the ""Heavy Metal Drummer"" song but for me that is where it ends. It's just boring and droll. If that is what they were going for, they nailed it. Beck's ""Sea Change"" blows this away."
2,Heavy Sigh,"Oh, well- Call me unhip, call me hypnotized with Top 40 playlists- Call me oh-so-un-alternative-But call me someone who needs a melody to connect with a song.Wilco - Tweedy - whatever - seems to have abandoned the need for connection and is railing against all things ""establishment"" to a point where he's one step from being another basement-pirate artist that cranks out navel-gazing noise that he, himself, finds oh-so-interesting in a 4am daze with incense burning, coffee pumping through his blood matched only by the nic-fit that his crumpled box of Marlboro's delivers.I've been to the mountain-top, seen Wilco live, bought the last record, which still clung to some need to make accessible songs, and I felt my blood boil when Wilco's old label said ""Yankee"" was a ""career-killer"".It is...but the REM potential of this singer / songwriter needs a serious lightning bolt to keep me interested.Resist the pull of the basement-pirates, Tweedy. Back to the drawing BOARD not bored...Spuddy O'"
2,Reality Check,"I have a suggestion: Wipe everything you know about Wilco out of your mind, sit down, pop in Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, and just listen. Forget about the drama with their record labels, forget about Jay Bennett leaving the band, forget about Wilco's unknown status (broken up?/together?)......just listen. If you hear what I heard, you'll hear a highly mediocre album that, at best, has a couple of good songs on it.I really like Wilco. I almost certainly will continue to like them. However, I think that those who are calling ""YHF"" things like ""The Best of 2002"" and ""Pure Genius"" are WAY off base - focussing more on the drama than the music. My vote?? I consider ""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"" one of the most disappointing albums of 2002. If you don't believe me, try the following. After you're done listening to ""YHF"", pop in ""AM"", ""Being There"", or ""Summerteeth"" and see what your ears and heart tell you. Don't believe the hype -- ""YHF"" is not that great."
1,Wilco hits a new low,"I didn't buy this CD. I didn't buy Summerteeth. After ""Being There"", I found it difficult to get excited about anything Tweedy did. Based on all these so called reviews, you'd think Wilco was the second coming of the Beatles. This CD embodies everything that drove me away from mainstream music towards roots, alt country, or whatever you want to call it. All this synthesized stuff bites it. This isn't a guitar band anymore. This music has no soul or passion. The only thing it might be good for is insomnia. I'll stick with old Tupelo, Jayhawks, and Jay Farrar. If you really want to hear a new CD that rocks, check out Bottle Rockets ""Songs of Sahm""."
4,good cd as a whole,"this is the fist wilco cd that i have bought, and i really like it as a whole. there are a few songs that i don't think fit with the others, but it doesn't matter i guess."
2,I just don't like it.,"I bought this album based on the fine reviews it had recieved. I think this album sucks. I have tried and tried and it has never grown on me. I think OK Computer from Radiohead is one of the best albums ever made. There have been comparisons made between the two albums, and I can understand why, but for me there is no comparison. This album just does NOTHING for me."
2,Playing With Toys,"I have been digesting Wilco in reverse chronology. I started with Blue Sky Blue after seeing them on SNL. Then I tried Kicking Television, and am now on to Being There and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. I find YHF the least enjoyable of the four albums, and actually find it irritating to listen to, particularly in comparison to the beautiful musicality of the later two works (guitarist Nils Cline being a serious upgrade) and the beautiful simplicity of Being There. The band seems to be playing with its toys, messing up otherwise good songs with out-of-place distortion and repetitive noises. After reading about the struggle Wilco had to get this album issued, I really wanted to like it. Instead, I have discovered why their former label hated it so."
4,Wilco Does it Again,While I don't think this album lives up to their AM album from a few years back .... it is definately worth buying if you are a Wilco fan or if you want to simply listen to an excellent recording. You must give it a chance though!! One litening of the album may not cut the mustard for some who are unfamilar with Wilco or similar bands (For some reason this recording reminds me of the Beta Band).
5,Vintage reggae at it's Best,"For those of you who love classic reggae(recorded in my opinion between 1968 and 75),this disc is a winner.Mr.Parker has a smooth voice and sings like the great ones,i.e.,Ken Boothe,Slim Smith,Pat Kelly,Jackie Edwards,etc.That is high praise indeed.The arrangements and production are typical for the time and that means they are excellant.The sound is mostly vintage mono,also typical for the time.Trojan has done a good job cleaning up the sound.As for the songs,Mr.Parker's big hit 'True,True,True' is not the same version I have heard on other compilations because he is singing with a DJ.However,that minor gripe aside,I can say almost all the other songs are consistently fine.I won't give a song by song review of the other songs.Suffice it to say,if you are interested in reggae music from this period,you should buy this disc.As a PS,the notes that accompany the disc are good.Enjoy this disc.I did."
4,"Wonderful book, reminiscent of Laura Ingalls Wilder","I read this book in Kindle format, and I even have it in my Kindle library, but I could not find it on Amazon.com in Kindle format to review it...Anyhoo, I loved this book, so much so that I purchased it and the movie for my niece. It's a wonderful book, with a strong female main character that I thought would set a fine example of how a young girl can succeed.I would definitely recommend this book for any girl who is an avid reader, loves history, the Laura Ingalls Wilder series, or the American Girls Series also.Happy Reading =}"
3,Good story but juvenile-style writing,"A good enough story, but the writing so juvenile to the point of boredom.I had to force myself to read the book after the first chapter. The writing is very childish even for my 9 year old grand daughter. Most of the dialogue was silly, and the characters ""laughed hysterically to tears"" over incidents not even the least funny. Like I said I endured to the end of this book, but my grand daughter was so bored, she gave up on it.If there is a redeeming quality, it would be the love between the 3 main characters, the girl, her father and aunt. This could have been a very good kids book. It has the bones, but lacks the meat.I am intriqued how this story would have been made into a movie!! Somebody must have worked a miracle on this one. Ho hum!"
3,Not a book for a heavy reader,"Another reader correctly wrote that the language is a bit stilted in this book - the writing seemed very simplistic and juvenile for me as someone who reads a lot. The story plods along not seeming to be heading anywhere. While others may have found this book heartwarming, I had a hard time appreciating the characters - perhaps this was because of the writing quality. I recognize that this book takes place in a simpler time. I think the ""sweetness"" factor is likely to just be appreciated by an older audience who are able to better relate to a different time period."
2,Much Cheaper elsewhere!,"Bought the exact same thing at Academy Sports for 90 bucks! Save yourself several hundred and go there!Other than that, it's an awesome game table & the kids love it! The fooseball is my only complaint! Putting in on and taking it off is a pain due to its size...and it's so huge, it's hard to store when you want to play the other games!"
3,"Great read, get a different copy...","This is a fascinating and important book to own, but get a different edition. The reason that they don't show the cover up at the top of this page is because it is HORRIBLY UGLY! I mean, neon pink and electric blue! Buy this book, but get a different copy of it!"
4,"Controversial, but Mentioned in the Old Testament","The Book of Jasher, or ""The Upright and Correct Record"" was spoken of and paraphrased in the Old Testament. If this is a translation of the original text, and since it is referred to in the Bible's other books, it makes me wonder if it shouldn't maybe have been included as part of the Biblical texts. Like The Books of Enoch, The Book of Jasher is a very intriguing look into the far ancient past that merits at least consideration of all avid readers who have an affinity for the mysterious and mystical."
2,The Book of Jasher,"Having my Masters in Scripture, I was wondering why I did not know that this book existed since it was mentioned in the Old Testament and I had learned that it was a lost book of antiquity. To say the least I was suspicious when I got this book as a gift. I was right to be suspicious because it is not authentic. It is a forged work of the late 1700s or early 1800s - (even an internet search will point this out). It may be amusing but just remember that it is not based in any real historical work."
5,A Must See!!!,By far Dr Ravi Godse's best movie yet. An entertaining mystery thriller movie that is a must see!
2,Bad movie,This movie was not very good. It will go out in our next yard sale for $1.00 and we're hoping we'll get that much for it. The description sounded like it would be a cute movie but it was a waste of time & money.
5,great replacement for fridge,"We mounted these inside of our kitchen cabinets, and use magnetic clips to hold papers, schedules and calanders,Works great! Nice to get the stuff off the fridge."
1,Waste of money,"I recently purchased two of these as stocking stuffers for my Mom and Sister since we are going to Italy in March. When I received them in the mail, I opened them up to make sure they worked, and they indeed did not work. I looked at the manual, and the particular ones that were sent to me were manufactured in 1989!! I would definately not reccomend this item. Go to a store and test these out before you purchase."
4,Impressive debut,"I bought this cd based on a number of favorable reviews that I read. After about a dozen listens now, I can report that I have been pleased with my purchase. I would not categorize Kathleen Edwards as ""country"" or even ""alt.country"" - Failer is definitely rock and roll (in particular, ""12 Bellevue"" and ""Maria"" rock hard), which is a good thing in my mind. Good hooks abound, and the addition of banjo, organ, horns, and violin make for consistently interesting music. While not perfect, this recording is a very impressive first outing for Ms. Edwards, and I look forward to her development as an artist. I highly recommend Failer."
2,Copy Kat(hleen),"This cd is a blatant copy of Lucinda Williams' work. I noticed that the guitars have been tuned to duplicate Ms. Williams' sound. Also the way she phrases her lyrics and even her voice itself is attempting to sound like Lucinda Williams. Tracks 1 and 2 are almost identical to songs on Lucinda's cd ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road."" Despite the fact that she copied another artist, I still gave her two stars because she did such a good job of it. I look forward to Lucinda's new album this year. I've never seen someone be this influenced by another's work."
3,A solid 3.5 stars,"I bought this after hearing the constant Whiskeytown and Lucinda comparisons. ""Failer"" lived up to my expectations, but it is no substitute for the real thing. Again, if you like the ""alt.country"" genre you should be very pleased with this release."
3,3 1/2 stars for a good debut with room to grow,"Kathleen Edwards definitely has talent. ""Failer"" can fit in smoothly on a CD changer among alt country contemporaries. Being Canadian is a nice, counter-culture touch...most cuts were recorded in Toronto and boast primarily Canadian talent. Edwards hooks you from the start, with the catchy guitar licks that open the genuine tear-jerker, ""6 O'Clock News"", and her gritty, young but not-born-yesterday-mister voice evokes a smoky Emmylou Harris or a less hardened Lucinda Williams.The tragic flaw? The more I listen to this CD, the more it seems I'm hearing the same song over and over. The melodies are invariant, if catchy. Edwards' songwriting abilities are stronger on the lyric side, but still dip into cliche on occasion. Hopefully future offerings will show variety worthy of this young woman's clear potential."
2,"Disappointed with ""Failer""","I was disappointed with this CD, especially after reading several positive reviews. I will admit to liking the music very much-the instrumentation, arrangements and melodies, and the song lyrics and messages. What I did not care for was the singer's voice. While the artist's voice has been described as ""breathy,"" I would be more inclined to say ""atonal."" It was an uncomfortable voice to listen to and, unfortunately for me, the really good music did not counteract the vocals. I think that Edwards would make a terrific song writer, but I would prefer it if someone else sang her songs."
2,Why all the hype?,"I saw this little Canadian bumpkin open up for Richard Buckner and was disappointed, to say the least. And now, months later, as I am seeing her name all over I decided to give the CD a chance, thinking optimistically that something magical may have happened in the editing room. While her voice is palatable and the music is catchy, it is nothing revolutionary and I find the lyrics to be self-indulgent and trite. If you want edgy, smart, and sarcastic, listen to Liz Phair. To compare Kathleen Edwards to such greats as Ani DiFranco and Lucinda Williams is nothing short of a slap in the face."
5,Recommended!,"Someone recommended this CD to me when I was looking for some new music. Unbelievable! Sometimes, an album comes from nowhere and hits you broadside and leaves you with indellable impressions. The recording quality of this album varies, but the songs are well written and from (someone's) heart, and the music creative and raw. I love this kind of stuff and this is a fine example of the kind of music those record labels should be putting out instead of that overhyped, overproduced waste-of-my-time. Just listen to the first line of song #10, Sweet Little Duck, with headphones and experience someone singing to you from somewhere deep. This CD has spent full-time in my car and on my headphone system. One of my favorite albums of 2003."
4,"Depressing, but good","I got this on a whim, and have been really satisfied. I think my favorite song was ""Hockey Skates"". Some of the songs are a bit simplistic, but overall, a wonderful first album. I look forward to more."
4,Rip my heart out and show it to me while it's still beating.,"There comes along a singer/songwriter every great once in a while who you can tell possesses an old soul. They are wise beyond their years. Kathleen Edwards is one such artist. When you listen to her songs you tap into the collective consciousness. I'm glad I didn't hear this CD when I went through my break-up. KE taps into every raw nerve that you feel when relationships go south... guilt, betrayal, despair, hungering to be numb. And then you come out on the other side... having weathered the cathersis... hopefully. KE will get 5 stars when she stretches herself. In this, her US debut, she is comfortable sitting at the bar telling us about her life, and not sparing us any detail."
3,A Promising Debut,"I was intrigued by the advance word on this album in No Depression and elsewhere. Kathleen Edwards is indeed very talented and has a warm, textured voice that does put one in mind of Lucinda Williams. Unfortunately, the songs and the playing on Failer are uneven. There is some very inspired stuff here--if there was any justice in this world the opening cut ""Six O'Clock News"" should be a radio hit, with its infectious stumble rhythms and chimey guitar riffs, let alone the intensity of the lyrics. But too often the songs lapse into alt-country cliches and the band, which at its best does have something of the raw energy of Crazy Horse--like the cover sticker says--sometimes sounds uninspired. But I remind myself that ""Car Wheels"" wasn't Lucinda's first record, and I'd suggest buying this enjoyable album to foster the career of someone who could really give us a masterpiece one of these days."
5,Kathleen Edwards is Amazing and Talented!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am in LOVE with this band. You will be too. She makes you want to hit the road and follow the band! Really deep haunting vocals that catch you off guard. This band is why we listen and buy music. I can't wait for the next album. If you buy this one, you will end up buying them all. She is a must see in concert too.Robyn"
3,Some of the tracks are good. Some not so good.,"The first track (tunnel) is overpowered with what sounds like a child playing the same short tune over and over on a toy piano. The second track (la citta nuda) is just barely more tolerable because the piano sound is not as prominent. The third track gets better and then the rest are better still.The two advertised videos are either not there or at least not recognized by Windows Media player, Real One Player, and Quicktime."
5,Skruff Magazine,"Despite possessing one of the worst band names in music, Italian house fusionists The Dining Room are clearly wizards in the kitchen, whipping up a smorgasbord of delicious musical flavours on their new and third album Tre (Italian for three). Featuring downtempo Balearic ballads alongside jazz tinged uptempo dance numbers, what distinguishes the album is the sheer quality of its song-writing, providing warm and immediately accessible musical foundations for vocals from singers including Tosca collaborator Anna Clement and Sean Martin. Martin's voice, in fact, is one of the standout distinguishing characteristics of the album, transforming opening track Tunnel into an atmospheric almost Massive Attack style balled dripping in emotion and mood. Laidback, luxurious and easily listenable, Tre is an album that will grace coffee tables, lazy sunny afternoons and anywhere else in"
4,Pleasing and funky,"Look, the same person wrote all of the reviews above this one. Believe me - it's worth having, but don't scream and shout like it's the end of history. Pleasing and funky and maybe good for sex."
5,Best CD for Sex,"Honestly, this CD is very sensual and intoxicating. If you have wondered what music goes well with sex, try this. The music itself is very soft and flows well, and the occasional vocal does enough to spice up the sound. 5 stars no doubt"
5,Excellent Book for Beginners Learn Dbase 5.5,"This is an excellent book, that taeches using independend and complete programs with uniques details for beginners."
1,Beginners Only,"This book is a big disappointment. It misses everything on the basics of OOP. It won't explain anything about classes, methods or even variables. Big thumbs down ! BTW : if you are interested in multimedia, there are 3 chapters devoted to it. However, I would prefer them in a separate book than sacrifice on the essentials of OOP."
1,Beginner Trap,How any of the other reviewers can say this book is any good is beyond me. I can only assume they are beginners who lack any experience at all using visual dbase. Visual dbase uses OOP. A point completely lost on the author of this book and I assume the other reviewers. It is the one of the worst books I've seen on visual dbase. No I'll revise that: It is the worst book I've seen on visual dbase.
3,Good place for getting started,"The book was generally helpful, but the authors seem to forget about reports and creating toolbars and classes. I guess that I expected too much from such a simple book."
1,useless book on vdbase,This book keeps telling the reader to use command line entry. To set up a form takes 3-4 pages when OOP does it in about 2 seconds. There is no real information in this book. You could learn more abour dbase from a book on cookery. It is useless. An expensive waste of paper.
4,Excellent for sleeping or playing,"Our baby slept in this chair for a few weeks to alleviate slight reflux issues. It is well padded, and it's adjustable. We are still using it for occasional napping, or for a convenient place to hang on to him while we travel. We chose it because we didn't want vibration, and we did want something easy to take along on car trips. The toys were never a bit hit, but I stuck our Whoozit on or another velcro toy, and that worked out. It's aluminum, not plastic. The one problem we've had is that the wooden pieces in the back, which are adjustable, sometimes slip."
2,Egghead.,"I had heard this album was the beginning of the end more than once, but I saw it cheap and picked it up. I might want my three dollars back. Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible, and some tracks I may even like, but overall it just doesn't pack a punch. Even the remix of ""Family Man"" is just ok, and the cover art is also ugly. I hate to hate, but stick with the far superior ""That Total Age"" album, or anything pre-""Ebbhead"". This is just industrial-lite."
2,NE starts to lose it,"I was so excited to get this CD when it first came out and I was so disappointed. Nitzer Ebb has never been a deep & thoughtful band (guns, guns, guns) however you could always count on Nitzer ebb to do great on the dance floor. ""I give to you"" and ""Family Man"" were the only two decent songs on the whole disc and they are not that great. If you want to check out some great Nitzer Ebb I recommend you check out ""Belief"" and ""That Total Age"".As a DJ this CD is worthless, I have never once had one song off this disc requested, nor would I play anything off it on my own."
5,Absolute Gem,"This is an excellent collection of tunes from the ""Otis Redding of Jamaica."" We are so lucky that this soulful singer was born in Jamaica and has pure reggae sensibility. I believe that this music can never be made again. It is a collection of early rocksteady tunes which are interesting, but do not add anything spectacular to the genre. Where Ken Boothe shines is in the cover versions of soul music. The difference is that he takes songs that are excellent in their own right (""Everything I Own,"" ""Love Don't Love Nobody,"" ""That's the Way Nature Planned It"") and lays them down in smooth reggae style. He is not derivative and trying hard to twist the song to fit into his style. He is simply interpreting the songs in his own way, straight from the heart. And the production is excellent, from instrumentation to perfectly mixed harmonizing backing vocals.Any fan of soul music or 70's reggae needs to hear this album."
1,Huge mistake!!!,"I've had this system for over 3 year's now and it has been in the shop or needed repairs more than it has worked.. The hard drive has died, it has had intermittent issues with just shutting down on it's own and now the wireless speakers make a continuos clicking noise. Steer clear of this (insert bad language here)"
2,Stay away!!!!!!!!,"I bought this unit 3 months ago. It freezes on me more often than not. Apparently, I am not alone. Everytime it freezes, I have to unplug and reset the unit. It happens at least 3 times a week. I was deciding between this and the Bose 3.2.1 system before my purchase. I pick this due to the cheaper price and 1080p upconversion for DVD thru HDMI. However, I regret my decision every time I have to get up from my sofa to unplug the unit due to the freezing issue. I even went as far as pluging the unit to a wall outlet rather than my surge protector just so I have easier access to reset it. I hope Panasonic is going to come out with a fix soon."
5,Lightening Through the Body,"This book is incredible. I love the characters, I love the stories. Each one will have you begging for more. They leave me with an intense feeling of wonderment. Campbell stands apart in the world of short stories."
5,strong and quiet fan,"After trying a lot of fans and hating most of them because they were either not really moving any air or they were too loud to have them sitting close to me, I found this one here and it does it all for me. I now have three of them and all are working great. They are quiet and they STAY quiet even after many hours of use. The only thing I'd improve is adding another lower speed level as the two levels it has are both providing a lot of air flow and sometimes I wish it could just blow with a light breeze."
5,Air King is King of the fans,The fan is an excellent product. It is the best made and quietest fan I've found. The price is a little higher than some lesser quality brands but this fan is well worth the difference.
2,aslight breeze,not good for much . gives a slight breeze if you stand in front of it just so. don't waste your money .
5,Awesome little fan,"This little fan works great. I turn the AC up during the day to save money on my electric, but it can get warm in the room where I am working. This little fan creates a smooth cool breeze that takes the edge off the heat making it pleasant."
1,Disappointment,"Disappointment.... what a waste of $22.00, I woundn't pay $5.00 for this fan. I can blow harded then this unit can move air. DON'T BUY IT!!"
5,they give you these fans at work,"If you need a fan at your desk, this is the fan the facilities people give you. It pushes the air very quietly and evenly. It's a nice compact big air mover on the highest and a nice gentle breeze on the lowest. I'm in love! I highly recommend this fan if you need a small space saving air moving quiet fan, this is the one!"
2,switch broke after 2.7 months....,Purchased Aug 11th and switch broke Oct 31. Now it won't turn on at all. Use? Run 8 hours a day monday - friday. Was great for that time though.
2,makes annoying clicking noise,..after a few months using it full time on low cooling the fins on the back of a refrigerator it started making annoying vibrating clicking noise..for a good sturdy quiet fan try wholesale marine $25.00 for a caframo chinook 7 inch fan.
5,Table Fan,The fan is quiet and ideal to circulate air in any small area. It is perfect on the kitchen table or even a shelf area. It has two speeds located on the back dial of the unit. The cord is grounded for safety. It is UL coded and tested.
1,WACK,THESE FANS DID NOT AUTOMATICALLY CIRCULATE...ALSO DIDN'T BLOW ENOUGH AIR FOR MY TASTE....I FELT THEY WERE CHEAP AND WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN
1,Too small too quiet,"We bought this fan because we wanted something cheap, to put in our rooms to make noise at night, and provide some slight air circulation. This fan is way too small, and hardly makes any noise. It did not accomplish what we were looking for. It does provide air circulation. Yes, the fan does turn."
1,Is this GOLD or what??,"I grew up listening to this on 8-track, which has long since gone away. I have looked all over for this on CD and was elated to find it on CD format on Amazon, until I saw that the seller had it priced for $199.00!! Are you serious?? I would love to own this CD, but there is absolutely no way I would ever pay this much it! Good luck selling it!"
1,no live concert tape,"Please be advised that this is no concert tape, but a documentary with a few songs that were taken from a cable TV performance."
5,"Great value, just what I needed","I received this today and I don't see why others are complaining about the quality of lamination. This map costs less than it does to get a 32x50 in sheet of paper laminated, so I wasn't expecting that kind of lamination and it isn't. But it's great for what it is, and seems pretty durable to me. The packaging was better than another map I had earlier ordered from amazon (which cost more, wasn't laminated and I had to return - because it came creased). Great product for what you pay, and will suffice for most people's needs.The colors are contrasting enough to be clearly differentiable and not too bright to look tacky. I'm not expert so can't vouch for accuracy, but it was wise of them to make the roadways a little lighter so that the map remains legible, while still being able to see all the roadways."
4,GREAT for the money,For the money this is perfect for an office or garage. The Laminate is not the top of the line of course. Like I said for the money it gives you enough detail for each state for anyone that wants to learn where the states are and the major cities. I would purchase another.
1,Read why this isn't even a good gift to give to someone you don't like,"This re-packaging by RCA is called ""Home For The Holidays"". But don't be fooled: Elvis never recorded that song -- yes, there IS a song called that, and it's not here. I wouldn't even tape a lump of coal to this to give someone I despise. Even people we don't like deserve a decent CD of Elvis at Christmas.Sure, this is a CD re-issue of the 1970 reissue of the 1957 Elvis Christmas classic. The 1970 re-issue had a different cover (what was wrong with the old one?), different from the other Pickwick and RCA Special Edition LP covers, and this is an even more different one. Just because it comes in a tin box isn't a good reason to buy this. As usual, RCA is master of the crass posthumus re-packaging/re-issue, feeding off Elvis' dead flesh. Capitol is a close second, committing the same sacrilege with the Beach Boys' awesome catalogue.The bottom line is, skip this and get the ""If Every Day Was Like Christmas"" compilation instead."
5,Books,I really love these books. I am fascinated by the technique used to get the 3-d affect. I have everyone out.
2,Undergradutes and Beginners: Avoid At All Cost,"This book a great review of linear algebra once you've understood all the concepts and just want to briefly see the theorems, props, and corollaries. There are minimal examples, hardly any computation (since the author is so lazy and tells the reader to prove the examples for him/herself), and very brief readings on each chapter. I HATE this book, to say the least. I have to look for other books to learn linear algebra from, as this is my first time taking an upper div. course in linear algebra at Cal. Graduate students love this book since they've had prior exposure to the material. As for me, this is definitely not a good place to start if you're beginning to learn linear algebra; no surprise in the few number of pages in this book. How do you really expect to learn from a book with completely vague questions and no solutions? This student is very frustrated and disgruntled by Axler."
2,Very poor quality printing,"I have nothing to say about the content of the book itself; it seems to be an excellent book. However, one major problem (that Amazon apparently tries to hide) is that the softcover edition is a print-on-demand book. This wouldn't really be a problem, if the printing quality was anywhere close to that of a normal book. Unfortunately, it isn't. The entire book looks like it was run through a cheap fax machine. There is noticeable fuzziness and pixelation; it is highly annoying, looks terrible, and makes the book hard to read. I cannot believe Springer would produce something of such low quality. I plan to return this book and get a used hardcover copy."
2,Lousy,"The author would be much more effective if he spent less time pontificating and patting himself on the back for not using determinants and more time giving decent arguments. Interestingly enough, even though the book champions the credo ""no determinants are necessary"" (a ludicrous idea to start with), he DOES grudgingly include a section on determinants and traces at the end of the book because by his own admission, they come in handy. The audacity of the title is a trend reflected throughout the book, punctuated by his neurotic insistance that this is the way things ought to be. It's a very odd book and frankly, not that instructive. I found it more difficult than you would expect at first glance since he gives the impression of an easy read. It develops most of the useful material you'd expect in a junior level course but not a lot of insight. It's probably harder than it need to be and the sections on Jordan form are truly aggravating. The book was a bummer, a total bummer."
2,The Hype is Not Justified - The Title Pompous,"There are a lot better linear algebra books out there - Larson, Poole, etc. Whomever is raving about this is not a student."
1,Few things more useless than a math book without answers,"I purchased this book with the intent on brushing up and improving my linear algebra which has become a little rusty over the past ten years. I based my selection on the average review score of this book and from the ""peak inside"" sample pages.Upon receiving it I was gobsmacked to discover that not only are no answers provided to the end of chapter problems, but that the answers are not available to print or download from the authors website. Infact the website goes as far as to say that solutions will not be provided to people engaged in self-study without exception.Frankly I'm astounded at this attitude from the author and will be returning the book immediately."
2,"good book for instructors, bad choice for serious students","The book is very terse, and most of the hightlights on the text is hiding on the problem examples, which only the instructors can either understand and access to it thoroughlly. I would recomd Strang's Linear Algebra and its application to most students who get a chance to know the hints of the problem and motivate them to more advance theoretical studies of the subject."
1,CAUTION: No answers or solutions provided!,"I learn mathematics by solving problems (including proving theorems etc). The author states it clearly in the introduction: No answers or solutions are provided for the exercises in the book (apart from the solved examples) and the solutions manual is available ONLY to course instructors that use the book in their course; the solutions manual is NOT available to individual readers for self study. I say, buy at your own risk."
4,"A bee-line to Jordan Form, but lacks examples","This books heads directly to a proof of the Spectrum and Jordan form theorems over both R and C. The proofs are clear, and the book is well organized. He points out the key results, and provides some helpful intuitive insights. I would give it 5 stars if he had some more examples. There are very few of these, and no complex ones.He proves all this without determinants, which has both advantages and disadvantages.Suitable for 2nd year or the second half of first year. For self study you'll want something like the Schaum's to go along with it."
2,"Good Writing, Lacks the UTM solution hints","Although this book is well written, there are NO solutions or hints to solutions. So it breaks with the Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics Series tradition of providing solution hints. For this reason, the star rating is reduced. One of the benefits of other UTM texts is precisely this feature which allows for self-study. This is instead just a textbook requiring separate course instruction for aid on problems."
4,Excellent for a second course in Linear Algebra,"The book does a better job of explaining what is happening at the heart of linear spaces and linear transformations than most. This is mostly due to the fact that linear maps and operators are used more often that matrices in the proofs, and that determinants are relegated to the end of the book. Overall a very good bare bones, gives you what you need book."
1,"It Should be Called ""Linear Algebra Done Wrong""","In a word: horrible. The author takes a totally wrong approach to linear algebra. He introduces matrices towards the end of the book, and spends about a page on them. The book is written in an essay format, with very few examples and worked-out problems. A better choice would be Bernard Kolman's Elementary Linear Algebra."
2,Thanks for destroying half of my undergrad degree...,"After taking 2 courses in Linear Algebra, I assumed that the 3rd would expound on ideas we had already studied. Well, I guess I was wrong. This book is extremely vague and tricky. Wait... That will help you learn?? NOT TRUE! What I understood about eigenvalues/vectors/spaces is complete garbage (according to Axler). Why should I be interested in determinate free proofs? Frankly, I don't know!!! Apparently the author is too lazy to dole out the work it requires to teach his class about determinants. How has this become my problem? Ask my professor for this semester. I see no point in re-hashing all of the perfectly good material I learned in the other 2 courses I have had. So I must say to Mr. Axler, stop trying to re-invent Linear Algebra, students have a hard enough time without your ego and laziness to worry about!!! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
3,Jabra 350 Pretty Good,"The features are good and the reception is about as good as I've seen. I haven't found a headset yet that didn't have some amount of static. The earpiece is somewhat flexible so you can get a slightly better fit. Still not perfect and it does fall off occassionally. For the price, I am satisfied until the next evolution of headsets comes out."
2,Average,"There is a definite trade-off between your own volume and the echo heard on the other side of the call. There are about 6 volume settings. Four out of those six settings causes an annoying echo for whoever you are speaking with. If you turn the volume lower to get rid of the echo, then you can barely hear the conversation on your end. I'd have to say I'm disappointed with this one."
1,Piece of crap,"I bought four, tried two out, and neither work with my VX8300 (bluetooth enabled)although they are supposed to. In fact, on a normal day I can pick up 4 other wireless headsets from the train passengers around me but no matter how hard I try to smash this crappy thing into the side of the phone, my phone can't pick it up.The manual says hold down the button and a solid blue light will come on, notifying you of 'discovery mode' Well then. All of mine seem to blink like idiots and do none of the above. Whats the chances of 2 not working?I better send these back to Buy.com before I make more dents on their cheap Chinese plastic surfaces (from smacking them against the table in anger)."
3,"OK headset, but not great","Like the title says, this headset is OK. It sounds decent to me and I have not heard complaints from people I talk to using it.The biggest problem is the user interface. These are two buttons for up/down volume, and another main button that has like 10 functions. Press it for 5 seconds and it does one thing. Press it for 1 second and it does something else, and just press it quickly and it does something else. So if you don't hold the button for the correct time, it will do something totally unexpected.I'll press it for 4.5 seconds instead of 5 seconds to turn the headset off, and to my surprise it dials out the last call I made and I don't realize it until I look at the screen on my phone. Additional buttons are a must."
1,Bad Purchase,"I purchased this item & when it was received, I charged it the required number of hours but, it did not work."
3,Good Headset but Volume too Low,"Good headset over all for the money ($30 with shipping) & the clarity is good on both ends. However, can't make the volume loud enough to hear comfortably when driving (with minimal roadway noise). Vibrating feature for incoming calls is nice feature...easy to pair with my Treo, but must be within a few feet of phone or it breaks up..."
4,Not Bad,Been using this for a couple of days now. Works well. Pairing with my Treo was a no-brainer. Only complaint is that the volume isn't quite where I'd like it to be. Just doesn't get loud enough sometimes. The volume on my phone and on the headset are turned up all the way. But it's still acceptable.
4,Good for the money....,"Great headset for the money.... earpiece is a bit awkward to position on the ear, but good speaker and microphone audio."
2,Not User Friendly,I bought this headset when I got my Blackberry 7130e in January. The problem with this headset is that everything happens through the multifunction button - almost everytime I tried to pair this device with my phone it would call the last person I called...I was repeatedly calling people I didn't want to or hanging up on them. The unit also was not reliable and sometimes would just not pair with the phone and had to be reinstalled a number of times. Finally I got tired of it and bought a Motoroal HS850 which I love. I highly recommend the Motorola over the Jabra.
2,Jabra BT350 a Disappointment.,"This headset seemed great at first. Now, people can't hear me when I use it. They say I'm breaking up. Adjusting the volume doesn't help. Finally, when I disconnect the BT350, my call becomes crystal clear. Also, this headset always turns itself on when it's in my purse and then dials people. That is a problem of draining the battery and of nusance calls. Unfortunately, I've had just past the 1 year warranty period so I'll probably have to buy a different one."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"Jabra has great reception, very lightweight, good talk time, and easy to use and link. Outstanding value !!!!!"
4,So Far So Good,"I am a Bluetooth ""newbie"" (actually I used to make fun of people who looked like they had been assimilated by the Borg from Star Trek). Like it so far - pretty easy to use and comfortable. Sound quality is a question, but for $25 it's a good deal."
4,nice and functional,"Nice substitution for paper filters. Plastic trim probably doesn't improve taste of coffee, but I haven't seen any alternative."
3,Not quite a standard shape.,"I think this filter is mainly for machines made by Mr. Coffee. It doesn't sit quite right with my coffee maker. Other than that, it does what it's supposed to do for decent enough price at $10."
1,Didn't last one month,"We have used one of these genuine mr. coffee filters for about 3 years bought from bed bath & beyond for about $15 with no problems. it finally started to come apart at the bottom so we placed an order for this one as a replacement and just at one month it already has started to pull away from the plastic frame, right in the middle of one of the sides. what a piece of poorly made junk. and btw, we never put it in the dishwasher and were always very gentle with it while washing. is it possibly not a genuine mr. coffee?? do not buy this filter. it's not even worth the time and energy to send it back. now i have to buy another one since this one is already leaking coffee grounds out of the hole."
3,Permanet style cone filter review,Although we like the concept of reusing our filter and using the reusable one seemed like a good idea we don't like how much of the grains get through. THe flavor isn't as dense for the coffee and we end up using more grounds to get the right flavor since it runs through much faster with this style of filter.
4,perfect fit,"I was a little hesitant when I purchase this product. I was reading the reviews, I went ahead and purchased the item and it was a perfect fit for my coffee maker. I am glad I ordered 2. Fast shipping."
2,Too much plastic,"I was disappointed in the amount of plastic at the bottom (hard to see in the photo). Pouring boiling water over the plastic isn't my idea of healthy, so I stopped using it."
5,Always a favorite,"Along with Laurel Aitken and Desmond Dekker, Derrick Morgan is a godfather of ska, rocksteady, and reggae. Like the other two mentioned he is a favorite of skinheads, rudies, and mods the world over. Great stuff here."
5,wow,I bought this book for my sons who do not like that authors usually write for young adult fiction. They now want to read everything from Anne McCaffrey. I read this book myself and wished she made it into a 10 book series. It is that good.
4,"Quite a good book, but not her best","This was one of McCaffrey's better books, although not comparable to her ""Dragonriders"" series. It's of a completely different flavor. But still a very good book!"
3,"Historical, but not well intertwined.","Throughout reading this book I had mixed feelings about it. At parts it seems to just be like reading a text book, at other parts it felt like I was reading more of a Lord of the Rings type adventure.From my point of veiw the author was very careful to make all of his data historical. Lots of the events in this story are closely related to, or completly the same as many historical happenings. In some parts of the book this can be great, but in other parts it seemed like the author was trying a little to hard to get tons of facts in the book.I give it 3 stars, mostly because it is a good read, but there are a few flaws in the book."
3,Could be better,If you like horses you won't have problems to read the book right til the end. But it is rather a description of how Artos got his black horses than a story about it. None of the characters really captured me
2,a disappointment for a fan of Pern and Arthurian tales,"My 12 year-old daughter and I discovered Anne McCaffrey this summer and enjoyed almost all the Pern books we could get our hands on. I am also a great fan of Arthurian stories (my favorites being T.H. White ""The Once and Future King"" and Mary Stewart's ""Crystal Cave"" and ""Hollow Hills"") so I eagerly picked up this book. I found the characters flat and the story was not compelling (and horses play a big part in my life). Since ""Nerilka's Story"" was my least favorite Pern novel, I wonder whether McCaffrey has a harder time with 1st person singular narrative."
3,Nice Story but no thrills,"This book is a quick read. The story is rather simple, but seems to be quite accurate with historical merit. She has avoided the cliche Arthurian stories providing a new view that I did find refreshing. Have no doubts - this story is FIRST a story about horses and quite a distant second it is a story about Arthur (Lord Artos). I wonder if she couldn't have told this tale in even fewer pages, but it did keep me interested enough to finish it quickly. If you have an interest in the farrier craft or the historical idea of bringing large horses into the service of early knights you will like this tale."
3,"Not bad, but I expect more from McCaffrey","I liked the Arthurian flavor of this book, but it seemed to be a little on the low end of McCaffrey's ability. I sensed a kind of C.S. Lewis theme with the horse stuff...kind of like _The Horse and His Boy_ if you have ever read that. I wouldn't recommend it for someone looking for a Pern-Like book, it will dissapoint you."
4,nothing special,"This was a good book, but nothing special. This book tells the story of Galwyn Varianus who works for his cruel uncle. It tells of how he meets King Arthur (Lord Artos) and of how he runs away from his uncle to help King Arthur in his quest to find big strong horses to carry his knights. As soon as they get the horses, this book focuses on the horses and we are allowed to forget King Arthur. Galwyn learns how to take care of the horses, which have hoof problems. These hoof problems create a need for Horse sandals, and Galwyn becomes one of the first farriers."
1,Upsetting debut,"""Discerning Forces"" is not necessarily a debut album, as the group has releases under their original name Incubus, but I list it as such because this is the first album under the moniker Opprobrium. The songs within are fairly average to sub-par mid-paced death/thrash with less layering than usual. The end result is a fairly one-deminsional album with lots of potential but no spark. Perhaps the greatest fault lies within a fairly flat production, though a definite fault lies within their inability to utilize any atypical styles or approaches to the already saturated genre."
4,Fun Education.,"THE LOWBROW GUIDE TO WORLD HISTORY really isn't as lowbrow as it would want one to believe, nor is there a whole lot of world history here. Granted it touches on everything from dinosaurs to King Tut to Alexander the Great to Bill Gates and proposes such ideas that perhaps the reason dinosaurs went extinct was because their testicles got too hot or that Hitler only had one testicle. Nevertheless, none of this subject matter is discussed in-depth and much of what one will find in here can be discovered in a standard set of encyclopedias. Still, THE LOWBROW GUIDE TO WORLD HISTORY is an entertaining book full of delightful nuggets of useless information, such as the fact the food ingredient MSG was first produced in 1908 or that tulips aren't originally from Holland. Overall, this is a fun little book that makes a great gift for any trivia nut or reluctant high school history student."
2,"Decent, but disappointing","On balance, I'm unhappy with this product.I used it solely for bedtime reading with my wife asleep next to me.Pros:* Much dimmer light than incandescent, easier on the partner* bulb never needs replacingCons:* Batteries could never get inserted quite right. This meant the light could rarely be turned on without first jostling the batteries.* Drains batteries pretty quickly, even when not used. Better get rechargeables.* Dimmer light than incandescent, harder on you!* Needs a hardback book to really work. It's too heavy for paperbacks.* Particularly for bigger books, the light head doesn't fold enough to cover all parts of the page. So you will likely be reading parts of the page in dim light, and parts in bright.As I said, on balance, this product needs work."
4,Best Book Light I've Owned,"I've owned many different book lights, including the original ""itty bitty"" book light, and this is by far the best. I would have given it '5 stars' if it wasn't for one little quirk that others have noticed. The fact that it doesn't come on everytime. I did the battery switching, etc. to get it to light until I found out the secret. As long as it is in a lighted room when you switch it on (the brighter the better) it will come right on without a problem. If the room is completly dark it will not come on. I sent an email to the tech staff at Zelco, asking about this, but they never answered.It does use batteries up quickly, but a AC adapter (or battery charger)will solve that problem. The origional ""itty bitty"" used up bulbs like mad, which were much more expensive. It lights entire pages, of the largest books, with a light that is very easy on the eyes."
2,"Good light, problems turning on","This light is very good once it goes on. I've used a few book lights so have a basis for comparison:Pros:- Brighter than most, fine for reading in dark space- Well directed light, so won't wake someone else in bedCon (and its a big one):- It doesn't turn on consistently. Once its on, it stays on and is great. But fluorescent bulb technology has a high start-up power need, then it runs on low power very well -- creates low heat too, very efficient. They just spec'd the thing wrong in its battery power. So it irritatingly won't turn on. Sometimes I just leave the switch on and a few minutes later it comes on. Other time jiggling. Has nothing to do with fresh batteries.Note that the most positive review comes from someone who also recommended the AC adapter, which I suppose overcomes the problem.Overall, take a pass."
3,"Good, But Not Great Book Light","This product appeared to be nearly perfect at first. However, the batteries don't seem to last very long and the light doesn't always come right on. You usually have to jiggle the battery case, or rearrange them. It makes it difficult to know whether you need new batteries or not. However, when working properly, it's a very nice soft light. I like the idea that the bulb will last a very long time, but I doubt that the whole apparatus will have as long a life. I hope they try to perfect this one just a bit more."
5,Highly Recommended,"How good is it? I purchased one for my daughter nearly three years ago. I thought she might forget about it over time and that I would be able to claim it as it was tossed aside... Alas such never happened. She guards it with her life. I even tried using an immitation of this light that was terrible. I don't understand it as they both use the exact same fixture - but there is no replacement for the ""itty bitty"". It just works the way it should! Lights up the entire two pages, can be redirected as needed (rarely needed), gets better than expected life from the batteries....What can I say?! - I had to buy another. I take it everywhere I go."
2,"""itty bitty squeaky"" Book Light","I have been using this book light solely during my bedtime readings and I must say that after a year and a half it started to brake down. The fluorescent light is the right size and brightness; however, it doesn't always light up entirely. It requires me to press hard in the area of the on button or simply keep turning it on and off until the whole bulb lights up. In addition, the joint between the light part and the handle started to make a squeaky sound especially noticed during the night. I tried putting oil in that spot since there are no screws I could adjust. Well, it made matters worst. Before I bought this gadget I worried about waking up my ""honey"" with the overhead light, now I worry about the teeth grinding sound that the book light makes. Time to get a better one before I'm asked to sleep on the couch."
1,Not worth the money,"True, this light is nice and bright....once you actually get it to turn on! Sometimes it will only take 2 minutes; other times a full half hour before it lights up. I can't tell you how many times I've started to throw it in the trash. Don't waste your money on this one. Buy a cheap book light, even if you have to replace it more often."
2,Takes forever to turn on,"The people who commented about how long this light takes to turn on are absolutely right. It got so bad that I started timing it. It takes a minimum of two minutes to turn on and I have timed it at as long as six minutes. So when you just want a cosy read before bed, FIRST turn on the light, then go brush your teeth. By the time you get back, it might even be on.In all fairness, the light, when it finally does go on, is a nice bright white. I generally always use book lights with their AC adaptors, because I use them too much to bother with batteries. But you have to buy the AC adaptor separately.Even though the light is lovely, nothing this expensive should work so badly. But then, in my life, the search for the perfect book light is right up there with the search for the perfect hair dryer. Back to the drawing board, or the shopping cart, as the case may be."
5,Great motherboard,"I bought one at almost eight months, and i can say that the board has a huge design, and its very powerfull for users like me, that make using of overclock technics. It s realy worth the buck!!!"
2,Disapointing,"To sum up - disappointing. This is little more than a glorified coffee table book, and I would actually have preferred more pictures and less text. I read it in an a couple of hours, and was little the wiser, though with my appetite for more information whetted. Compared to some of the excellent French books on the subject, the content was negligable. ""Hornblower"" is thrown in every so often, but not in a consistent way, and eventually comes across as an irritating gimmick rather than a theme or thread. An intelligent reader could probably infer much of the information from a careful reading of the Hornblower series. Not recommended."
1,Poor build,"The small size is perfect if you do not want to stuff yourself every morning. However, if you accidentally place this mug in the dishwasher, the bottom WILL come off and you will get water accumulation between the inner and outer lining of the cup. This ""dishwasher water"" will then conveniently drip on your clothes as you are drinking your coffee. Do not recommend."
2,"Looks nice, leaks a LOT","I bought mine from the local BMW dealership and made sure it fit the cupholders in my 328i. But as soon as I tried drinking coffee it spilled very easily and I have resorted to taking the lid off to drink. Needless to say, this is incredibly inconvenient and a POOR design!"
2,Just a group of very basic ideas,"My wife and I own a couple of hair salons in Cincinnati with 24 awesome people who work with us. I was hoping to find some creative ideas so that we can better promote the folks in our salon who aren't as busy as they'd like to be.I really felt like this book fell short of any of my expectations. This is a very thin and small, unsubstantial book that really didn't have much to it. Nothing more than 101 paragraphs, not chapters that described really basic ideas for marketing.I also bought Fun, Creative & Profitable Salon Marketing by Aleen D'Angelo. 67 Chapters with at least 5 - 20 suggestions in each chapter toward understanding marketing.Brandt JunkerPS: Sometimes I wonder if some of these reviews aren't written by friends of the authors, or the authors competition. I bought both books and don't know Allen D'Angelo or Nanette Miller!"
3,Fun series -- but see the anime first,"It's a shame that the manga is only two volumes long. It's a great follow-up to the anime, but I'm not sure how someone who hasn't seen at least some of the anime episodes will understand the manga series. If there's a quibble, it's that the art is different from the anime, so takes a little getting used to. Otherwise, if you liked the anime, pick up the two-volume series!"
5,love this,"Got this for my new (used) SUV. Fits perfectly in the back of my 2009 lexus rx. Thick enough to do a great job, but thin and light enough that it's easy to move should you wish. Keeps my plastic boxes and cargo organizers from sliding around. Contains spills, holds dirt from potted plants & pumpkins... LOVE IT. The color is darker than the carpeting. I like this since it does not show every bit of dirt. A+."
3,Eddie & Our Gang,"Even thought this is a very enjoyable film, I only gave it three stars because it's predictable. But please don't let that hinder you from seeing this movie. It features a typically versatile performance from Cantor and features various members of Our Gang (Little Rascals)...watch closely for 'em, they're unbilled but there's quite a few! Cantor's wide-eyed acting style is legendary and he doesn't let you down here. His dream is to own an ice cream factory...and after inheriting a vast amount of money, he does...but only after numerous other characters try to weasel his inheritance away from him. If you enjoy films from the 30's (and watching crowd scenes for familiar faces) you won't be disappointed. It's a wonderful overlooked movie."
3,Not what I expected,I love Ghost Hunters but I was disappointed in this collection. I thought it was going to be a bunch of the best whole episodes. This is not the case. It was interesting to see Grant and Jason talk about the clips that they were showcasing but I would say just buy the whole season or another collection.
3,Ghost Hunters: Best Of Vol.1 and 2,I did enjoy best of Vol 1 and 2 but it seems like it is basically all the episodes on the 1st season. But it was still worth purchasing.
3,Not my pic for best episodes,Meh. The episodes included on these discs would not be my pics for best episodes from these seasons. They're ok. Not really worth owning the discs. Just watch reruns on the SciFi channel.
5,wow,i loved this. in my eyes it shows that something is out there.on voulume two in the top 20 number 1 what i saw is no doubt that man was attacked.the thing flew up and hit him in the face before he moved. then he falls on his knees like he caught himself and it looked like he was pulled down to the floor.no one pushed that thing up to hit him.deffintly something attacked him.this is a deffintly legit show
3,Almost perfect,"The package was recieved on time; however, the edges of the DVD case were crumpled (cardboard casing). Otherwise, the product itself is okay."
2,"I'm a Hand fan, but this was weak.","I love almost everything by Elizabeth Hand - she is probably the most unique writer working today. I really didn't like this book, though. It is a true postmodern novel focusing solely on characters to the exclusion of any plot. In other words, almost nothing happens in the book. There is no real beginning or ending to it. The characters don't change much, there is no interesting conflict, and they will have virtually no effect on the environment.Some readers seem to mistake this for shoddy writing, but in fact it is almost certainly intentional. Hand is breaking all the rules that crappy writing texts give you. Unfortunately, that doesn't make it readable. If you are an English graduate student interested in style you might like this book. Otherwise, there is plenty of other stuff out there (including more enjoyable Elizabeth Hand work) that you can read."
2,A let down even if you haven't read her other books,"This book started out pretty good. It had a cool framing tale, even believable, and the characters seem to be pretty well-developed, if not very deep.But let's face it: it didn't relate to a large group of people. I'm a guy, and I relate to guy books. No, it doesn't have to be all about explosions and wars (but that helps). I just like the book to mean something to me, and I guess I don't relate to Elizabeth Hand. I don't relate to the characters, and therefore I thought this book wasn't worth my time.But maybe you'd like to pick it up and try it, I don't know. I don't recommend it. I didn't feel that sense of awe...you know, when you finish something that was really great and you have to reflect on it...that was missing. And I didn't really find it entertaining, either. I just didn't like it. But I did like the cover art (that's my weak spot), so I gave it two stars instead of one."
3,Fundamentally disturbing,"Though it didn't disturb me quite as much as ""Winterlong,"" this novel still set my teeth on edge. The tragedy seems to be too drawn out to maintain any depth of connection with the characters, but still, this is a scary, often unnerving glimpse into a dark and unforgiving future--yet, somehow, the futile masquerade of society and the ghosts of those restless dead manage to mingle and create a promise of something brighter in the future. ""Waking the Moon"" remains my all-time favorite, with ""Black Light"" on its heels: lighter social commentary, more supernatural thrills."
2,A letdown if you've read her other works,"I read the phenominally good Waking the Moon in two sittings. Glimmering, however, took me two weeks due to my general impatience with the book and its plot (or lack thereof). There were a few character I had taken a liking to, but unfortunately, they fell prey to uncharacteristic behavior, the wallflower syndrome, of generally being too tortured to actually DO anything. Hand's prose, flowing and elegant, is still top notch, though her work here has many faults."
2,should have been better,"I'm a fan of Hand's writing, and when I found this book I was terribly excited. The plot looked great, and the reviews were good. But it was really a let-down. The characters were of the type that could have been very intriguing, but not enough was revealed about them to make them so. Otherwise it was interesting, but it seemed like it had been written aiming at the cheap-thrills mainstream rather than as a true literary effort like ""Waking the Moon""."
2,Written by - or for - the MTV Generation,"Eliabeth Hand has a way with words, but she's terrible with sustaining a narrative. Plot threads are introduced, only to unravel later as she gets distracted and pursues another tangent. Her characters are all outward-flung, fascinated by stimuli they can't process for lack of mental or spiritual resources. In the hands of someone who knows something about character development, plot structure, and compelling narrative, this would be a hard-hitting and eerily prescient novel. Ms. Hands has given us instead a series of vignettes, interrupted shortly before denoument."
3,Not what I expected,"If you are expecting a mystery with a twist as some of Ms. Hand's other material has proved to be, then you will be slightly disappointed. The sub-plots do prove to have a bit of a mystery to them, but you are left wondering for sure, because the characters really never make the connection. You, as the reader will probably catch the hints left by Ms. Hand.My rating is based more on the fact that this story almost seems like a combination of ""12 Monkeys"" and the movie, ""Highlander 2""."
4,"I believe in medication, I believe in a Prozac Nation.......","This book is the most recent in a long tradition of fin-de-siecle tradition, starting with Henry James'""The Picture of Dorian Gray"". It is a tale about apathy and hopelessness, despair and death. THe only reason I didn't give it a 9 is because, though lyrically written, it skimps in some places on the details and background that would explain a lot of stuff in the story. However, this book is worth at least taiking a look at. One last reccomendation: don't read it when you're having a good day. Save it for a gloomy, rainy day, and wallow in it"
2,Depressing view of sexuality,"You may be entranced by the author's language. You may be fascinated by her view of the ""future"" (1999). You may enjoy her characters. But if you're like me at all, you'll also be deeply depressed about her portrayal of human sexuality. Whether describing gay or straight ""lovemaking"" in every case there is sadness, guilt and discomfort."
1,Bad Science,"I know it's fiction, but it is supposed to be SCIENCE fiction. I couldn't get past the first chapter. As a graduate student in atmospheric chemistry, I was appalled to find that Hand apparently is learning atmospheric science from the Rush Limbaugh primer. Any senior science major in college could do better. A real disappointment."
4,The coming of the new Millennium,The Glimmering was a fairly good book. Hand's writing describes the end of the world beutifully. However the constant sex scenes (most homosexual) were too much and took away from the story. I thought it was a good story but the sex was unnescesary
4,Talent deserving wider recognition,"There are few singers today singing jazz as well as Donna Byrne does. She has some of the control and class of Peggy Lee, the interpretive skill of Carmen McRae and the sense of rhythm and swing of Anita O'Day--all while sounding not quite like anyone else. If it were the 1940s or 1950s, I'll bet she could be a major star--kind of like a more sophisticated and sensual version of Doris Day."
3,People in great shoes behaving badly,"Morally bankrupt and blandly ruthless operatives of a multinational plot to acquire a Japanese entity that cranks out morally bankrupt, misogynistic CGI manga. The fun comes from watching ethiclly challenged people in groovy, disheveled designer clothes playing what they think is hardball for the rights to said anime, while just out of frame something bigger and nastier than all of them is waiting to swallow up the whole lot. For all its chilly ambivalence, Demonlover is in the end a simple morality tale about a bad girl finding that her place in the food chain is a lot lower than she thought. How this gets her into trouble and into Emma Peels motocross outfit is all in the journey. Great score by Sonic Youth."
4,"Stylish, high-tech fun (with a soundtrack by Sonic Youth)","Compare this with 'Summer Hours' or 'Les Destinees' and you'll see that Olivier Assayas has as wide a range of styles as any current filmmaker I can think of.That said, this surreal, intentionally obtuse story of corporate intrigue centering around world domination of anime porn, makes less and less sense, climaxing with an `ironic twist' you can see coming from several miles off, and leaving one with the feeling that the film is slightly less intelligent than one might have hoped.On the other hand, It did improve on a second viewing. While the ending still bugged me, the odd, slightly irrational middle felt more in control and intentional, more a comment on it's main character than I caught the first time around.One of those films that can be enjoyed as a high-end, visceral, well made ride, as long as you don't demand perfection or high art."
3,ok movie,"Its an ok movie, probably a ""renter"" instead of a ""purchaser"". The acting is decent, but the story is hard to follow at times. Its about rival companies competing for the 3D anime market and one of the companies is involved in an underground adult ""fetish"" site."
4,"Slow Story, Excellent Visuals...","Demonlover is not for those who are looking for a great story, you won't find it here. What you will find is an excellent cast...and one of the most visually stunning films to come out in a long time. If you take it for what it is, you'll enjoy this film."
1,BORING!,"Wow, huge waste of time. This movie sucked even for a B film. The acting was lukewarm at best. Plot wasn't too terrible, but simply didn't hold my attention. Way too slow paced and low quality. Actors had no facial expressions at all 99% of the time, so it was hard to tell if they're capable of acting or just reading the lines. Cheesey violence, totally unsexy.Don't bother watching this one."
3,"Intriguing, But Unsatisfying","I watched this film from start to finish, which suggests I found it interesting enough to stick with. But, I was also totally perplexed by its many nonsensical plot twists. For example, it took me far too long to figure out that it takes place in the ""high rolling"" world of corporate financed porn (an intriguing idea, given the fact that I had no idea such a world existed - I always thought of the porn industry as much more contained and independent).DEMONLOVER is a little too stylized for its own good - its focus on form completely overwhelms its paper thin storyline. Connie Nielson is very good, but could have been so much better with a stronger script. I debated giving it only 2 stars, but felt the performances merited a stronger rating."
5,"It is an exciting, first-hand true adventure story.",A great read. The writer covers a little known aspect of the early days of Japanese success in WWII in Sumatra and Java. As an exciting adventure story as one is able to read.
4,Good Resource for Ecotourism,I am developing a eco-cruise company and found this book to be highly useful in stragetic planning. I highly recommend it for anyone experienced in the tourism business but desires to learn more about eco-tourism. It pinpoints certain aspect of tourism and provides examples of how your business can be ecotourism.
3,A typical story,I think the book is disapointing compare to the rest of the chronical. They should have been more fantastique thant that. All too stereotype for the poor Ventrue. Pathetic that they stay so dumb in the book than in the RP game.
2,Frequent Breakdowns,"With a massive collection of movies for our 4 year-old, when our old VCR broke down we couldn't simply replace it with a DVD player. The Panasonic unit seemed to be the answer. My wife and I could enjoy DVDs, while our son could still enjoy all of his old tapes.Unfortunately, it hasn't lived up to expectations. The DVD player broke while under warranty and was repaired by Panasonic. Although it took longer than I would have liked, they took care of it without any problems. Then the VCR simply stopped working, and now the DVD player is starting to have problems again, and it is only 1 1/2 years old.At this point I don't know whether we'll get it repaired or simply junk it, but I'm not at all happy with the reliability. Unfortunately, none of the other combo units I've researched seem to do much better."
3,Early Break Down PV-D4762 DVD/VCR Combo Unit,I just purchased the unit and have used it only 2 weeks when it would not accept VCR tapes. When you inserted them they immediately eject and aren't loaded. I now have to return the unit for repair via mail.While it was working I don't think the VCR unit was as good as numerous Panasonic VCRs that I have or have had in the past. The recordings on EP are somewhat snowy even when recording with Direct TV. Also I had problems getting good tracking when playing a tape recorded on another Panasonic VCR. I don't know if it is a reflection of this particular unit or a reflection of this model. This is the first new VCR that has broken after such a short period of time after owning dozens of VCRs datiing back to the 80's.
3,Informative but can be much better,"The 3 basic projects using various techniques was very informative and well structured. HOWEVER, only a very small time of the film gives you an close up view of these techniques. No offense, Nena, but I would rather see what you're doing than watching you talk. I would seriously suggest firing your camera person."
2,"Skilled Craftsman, Unskilled Videographer","The content of the video overall is good. Nena does a great job of walking through the steps for each project. But about 20% of the video is worthless due to the poor videography. As Nena holds up a piece to show the work, the piece is out of the frame. The entire soldering section is shot from so far away that you can't tell what she is doing. As long as you don't expect professionally shot video and sound, this DVD is right for you."
1,"Explain the sizing, please?","I got to this product by searching for ""Women's"" sizes and then swimsuits. I am plus sized and ordered a size ""22"" of this suit. When it came, the packaging said ""Size 22"", but the suit itself is toddler sized, maybe a 3 or 4!I'll save the suit because I have a niece that is 2 and will likely fit into the suit next summer. However, there needs to be a clearer guide about how this is sized!"
3,"Odd ""little"" item","This is a large bulky whisk. It is utilitarian and does the job intended, but doesn't fit in my utensil crock well and is bulky in the hand and takes up a lot of space on the spoon rest."
5,Fantastic travel companion!,"My wife and I travel outside the U.S. with some frequency. I purchased a Zelco 1-cup coffee maker about 3 years ago, and we have taken it to Asian and European countries where in many hotel rooms the most that can be expected is a way to heat water. This coffee maker has been a life-saver, from the standpoints of having a fresh cup of coffee in the morning and improving my wife's disposition. It has always functioned well, and it makes a great cup of strong coffee.A previous review alluded to the on-off button not working. I have found that the button sometimes is ""on"" due to pressure against it by other items in my suitcase. After that first brew, it works just fine."
1,Start button,"Except for the non functioning start button, this Travel Coffee and tea brewer is great. A start button is kinda essential though - in my experience with three Zelco's, the button just doesn't work."
4,Zelco Brisk Brew,"I only use the Brisk Brew for heating water while on vacation....I'm a tea drinker. My Ex husband got custody of the first one we bought, so the search was on. When I couldn't find it in the stores I went on line. As soon as I saw the exact same I ordered it. It works great, and travels light!"
2,Disappointing,I thought this book would give objective advice on how much insurance someone should buy. It told me a few things I didn't know but I wouldn't have paid the price for the book for two or three pages of useful advice.
2,Not a Whole Lot on Homeowners Insurance,"I bought the book thinking that I'd be getting detailed information about homeowners insurance but the author merely glosses over the subject matter.I think he's an agent and, as such, doesn't have that much experience when it comes to the information I need, such as claims (particularly mold since I was just cancelled as a result of filing a mold claim), how to interpret specific policy language, etc."
5,Great for Pros and Cons,"Wondering what kind of insurance to get? Wondering how to handle an insurance problem? This book not only tells you what kind of insurance to get for your situation, it also helps you handle situations in which insurance is difficult or impossible to come by.This particular book may be outdated due to the new PPACA."
1,Lacks Depth in Homeowners Insurance Discussion,"I was looking for a book that discussed IN DETAIL homeowners insurance, and I didn't find it in thisone.Claims, how to appeal a denied claim, mold, how to avoid being under-insured and/or cancelled--these subjects are ignored, even though they're important to me and most people I know.This book is a WASTE OF MONEY if what you're looking for is in-depth info on homeowners insurance."
5,Invaluable resource and reference,"This title is well worth getting if you're thinking of purchasing new coverage or if it's been a long time since you've reviewed your current coverage. There's a lot more to insurance than most realize, and this book can help make things a lot clearer, save you money, and prevent nasty surprises down the road. Note that this Canadian edition appears to be identical to the American one in all respects."
1,Not as Good as I Expected,"My house was a total loss after a fire. I needed info on home insurance so I got this book. BIG disappointment. No help at all.I then got another book on Amazon titled ""Mold, Fire, Flood & Other Topics: Homeowners Insurance Explained."" Great book--I recommend it."
3,didn't cover auto no fault(which all of my questions entailed),I purchased this book to explain if i had coverage if i was at fault.especially in no fault states. it just said you would be covered(by your own insurance company) regardless of fault up to the limits. what limits? the liability or the un/underinsured limits(when they are different). if you are in an accident out of your no fault state but hit someone who is from your state or vice versa.
1,Disappointed,My 7 year old daughter picked out this game because she likes Bratz dolls. We were all disappointed to find out that you can't actually dress up the girls. All you can do is move arrows to make them dance. My daughter is very disappointed. I would not reccommend buying this game. It is not worth the money.
4,Fascinating,"The title is boring--yet another journey to motherhood?--but the book itself is great, if a bit too wordy at times. A brainiac scientist gives it her all to describe the physical and emotional components of her own pregnancy and birth experience, as well as instructing the reader in all kinds of science. Recommended."
1,Wood stove gasket.,"When I ordered the gasket set pictured , it leads you to believe that there are 5 diferent sized gaskets that come with it for one price.BEWARE this is not so .Add is very misleading. Make sure you ask for the right diameter. Other than that, the product is serviceable."
1,A waste of time and effort,"The advertisement indicated it worked with Vista Media Center. It did not -- it would not be recognized as even connected to the computer. No mention of Media Center in setup manual. Support responded with only a ""canned"" response that did not even acknowledge my specific setup problem with Vista Media Center but provided a duplicate of the setup manual. I returned the product for a full refund. I am grateful that AMAZON provides for customer satisfaction"
4,This is an excellent reference guide,This book has lots of information for both beginning gardeners & advanced gardeners in the south. My favorite chapter is the butterfly garden chapter (lots of great charts!) I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in this hobby.
5,Great book,"A quick, easy read. Thich Nhat Hanh is a favorite of mine. I have enjoyed this book so much that I have read and reread it."
5,AWESOME SERVICE,I received my book today and read the first chapter. It is in perfect condition and a great read so far.
5,Be Love,"This is a little book you can read within a couple of sittings, and if you are open to it, it will open your heart.It's not a book about relationships or about fixing problems -- it's about changing your perspective, becoming still and present to your experience. You don't need to search for love elsewhere -- if you can consistently practice what Thich Nhat Hanh calls ""mindfulness"", you will *be* love and you will see it everywhere. When I was done reading this book, I felt a sense of peace and presence and a wonderful knowing that all the love I ever need is right here in my own heart."
5,A practical guide to understanding love,"This book is simple to read and addresses the ""how to"" for understanding and LIVING love. It is a GREAT gift book to share with others."
5,"a brillant ,simple, little, book",This is the first book I have read by Thic Nhat Nanh. The book is brief but not skimpy in content. It's a good book to read when you feel your love life is going a bit crazy to STOP & focus on what is important...true love begins in yourself. namaste
4,A Good Recommendation/A Good Gift,"A student passionately recommend this book to me. While I haven't had time to read it, I did turn around and gift my copy and it was very well received."
5,Well pleased with the book.,"True Love: A Practice for Awakening the Heart is a gem of a book. Filled with Zen-like advicethat rings true, and is worth taking the advice which is to emulate its teachings. It will bea book that I reread many times."
5,Wow,I have read this book over and over and over again. I am thinking about reading it again. The practices that he gives to truly BE there with the person you care about is wonderful.
5,Best book on love,"This is a fabulous book for couples, parents, friends, etc. Thich Nhat Hanh has a way of describing love in a way most people can understand. He also uses stories to illustrate the meanings."
5,Little book with significant comfort,"I absolutely loved this enlightening book. It explores all key elements necessary for genuine love. One of the characteristics many books miss is the concept of peace intertwined in love, and this book reinforces that concept. I learned much about Eastern philosophy from the meditations in this work. A great read that has helped me appreciate those I love."
5,"What love is, what it is not, and how to do it right","I purchased the 2 disc audiobook and am completely entranced. I am putting actions and principles into practice right away. It is the most truthful, simple, to the heart teaching on interpersonal love to which I have ever been exposed. I am very grateful - for the teachings, and more so for all the love around me that I receive and can give even better now. It shows the way for fixing messed up relationships where there is true mutual love - taking that big leap of letting the other know that you are suffering and asking him to help. It amazes me that a monk knows so much about ordinary people and can help us. I revere Thich Nhat Hanh and the faith and practice which inspire him."
5,Awesome book!,"I just love Lisa Samson's writing. Each book only gets better. I can't say enough! The leading characters are human, they stubble, but always their faith gets them through. I feel my own faith grow with each novel I read of Lisa's.This book follows a strong young woman who is inflicted with a birthmark on her face. This book teaches us that we need to look through the imperfections of people and see the person underneath. I found myself laughing, crying and rejoicing with these characters. I actually go through withdrawl after Im finished the book and can't wait for the next one! Start by reading ""Indigo Waters"" (book one in the series)and have ""Fields of Gold"" waiting by your side to start when you are finished Indigo. I promise you will not be disappointed!"
3,WARNING!!! Incorrect information listed!,"I received the curtains yesterday; I purchased them for my sons birthday and was very excited that they would be long enough to fit my son's windows. Well, to my dismay, they are not. The listing is false, they are not 82 x 63 inches. They are 82 x 63 cm!!!!"
5,Law forms,An interesting collection of legal forms for the use of farmers and others as they made their way west to the open frontier.
1,"The Caribbean Vacation Series: The Bahamas, An Overview","Do not purchase this video if you want to see the Bahamas. You will see one hour of mostly ariel still shots and navigational maps. I was expecting to find visuals of sights, resorts, dive locations, etc. I was very dissappointed."
1,Wasted Money - It does fall apart easily,"My poor unsuspecting son was soo excited when he saw the pirate box set but within seconds of opening the package the pirate flag's stick broke off (a slight premonition of things to come). The toy is cheaply, cheaply made. The hat is made of plastic, doesn't resemble much of a pirate hat and does not fit securely on my son's head. The treasure box does not open (what is the point). Where am I going to store the treasure of rubies and gold coins?? I'm sure they'll be safely lost in the couch abyss. The hook is loose and will probably fall apart after a few more uses. The chain broke after the first use. I don't know what i was thinking buying this particular kit. I feel so many things are missing and to make things worse, whatever items I do have will fall apart soon.If I could easily return it I WOULD!"
2,Sorry,"This was purchased as a gift for a three year old boy, and happily he likes it. Unfortunately, I did not: the set seems really flimsy and cheap: I'd be surprised if they were all still in one piece."
3,Starter Pirate Set,This is a good pirate set for those who are not sure if your kids are into pirates or not. It has all the necessary pieces but my son was very disappointed that the treasury chest could not open.
2,Cheap,"My son (3 1/2yrs)loves Jake and the Neverland Pirates on Disney Junior. Unfortunatly there is no merchandise out there for this show. When i stumbled across this gift set I was so excited to get it for him. Almost everything broke immediately and i paid almost $40. The only thing standing is the Hat, sword and scope. Everything else we had to glue or throw away and the little treasure chest is plastic, hallow and it does not open. He loves the set don't get me wrong I just wish it were made more durable"
4,Everything a pirate needs,"Comes with everything a pirate needs, even bounty. My 4yr old really likes it. The set is a little more sturdy than I expected."
3,Fix,Not happy at all with the packing when I got it the box was busted open the outside box looked like it got all kinda messed up luckily the toys where ok but had to take the toys out of the box for it cause how messed up it was
2,"Flawed...Are these ""seconds""?","The price was very good, but the first one I ordered had to be returned, due to surface flaws. I ordered another, and it also had surface flaws and I had to return it. These are what I consider ""seconds"" and maybe that is why you are selling this item at a low price, but I would not have ordered, even at the low price if I knew that these were flawed items."
2,Looks like factory second,"The product I received would have been considered a ""second"" had I bought it directly from HLC. Should probably cost half the price for a piece in this condition. There were several deep pock-marks in the glaze, both on the outside and inside of the dish. Ended up returning."
2,book good condition poor,"The book is very good and I know I ordered a second hand copy, but I think that its condition is less good than I expected, with much writing by a previous owner in the margins. The binding is Ok but given the writing, it is not a clean copy.Jan Morris (then John Morris) writes beautifully and it is always a pleasure to read her books."
5,Useful book,"This book has a lot of valuable information for the fly fisherman, I would definitely recommend it to anyone new to the sport."
2,WORLD SHIPPING DIRECTORY,"DESCRIPTION THIS BOOK I.E I WANT CHECK SHIPPING COMPNY DETAILS(NAME,ADDRESS,TEL,FAX ETC)"
1,No it's NOT,"I am curious as to why if a true analog guru this shoulda have been recorded in 8 MM film. Not a DIGITAL format. Ya can't push analog on digital, it's like 2 opposite forces coming to a conflict. And selling it on Amazon which is accessed digitally, it's like caught in a self hating vortex. I'm convinced it's not a vinyl world. Found this dvd to be useless, zero knowledge obtained, nothing different than what would come with a good TT, instruction book, or phono cartridge. It's almost for someone who is clueless, as this is such base info, why bother. Don't waste your money like I did. And there is no satisfaction guarantee, MF refuses to refund my money. Yet he profits from it, but says he didn't sell it!?? It's as bizarre as his thoughts, and imaginary things he claims. Buy a good meal instead of this drivel. I WANT A REFUND! LEARNED NOTHING. All he does is tell you the stuff that comes in an instruction manual with any decent TT. What a sham. Save your money. Man was I hoodwinked."
1,Doesn't fit 2nd generation Nano,"Unfortunately, this device was rated highly by several reviewers, but does not mate mechanically with a second generation Ipod Nano. Couldn't use the device at all. Nothing in the description indicates that this will not fit a second generation Nano, however the website does address the compatability issue indirectly. Amazon, update your information!"
3,subliminally catchy,"Having greatly enjoyed To Rococo Rot's ""Veiculo"" and ""Music Is a Hungry Ghost,"" I bought ""The Needle Was Traveling"" with some confidence. It did not immediately engage me, but Lippok's vocals dug into my unconscious and made me reach for the record over and over. ""Stone,"" ""Across The Dial,"" and ""The People"" are subliminally catchy -- this is an album of understatements that is very rewarding over the long term."
3,OK stuff if you are a new father,"I must admit that I was very let down by this program. I was expecting lots of new information and learning and how to stuff namely because the author has M.D. and has written another book about men. However, what I found was a lot of the information had to do with theory, and stats. Also, a lot of it had to do with new fathers and infants. When they did talk about teens issues, it was the typical stuff you find in parenting books. I guess I was looking for more personal stories from the authors and how to deal with certain issues if a person did not grow up with their own father and less audience participation (the lecture was taped in front of 10 men). Also, the audiotapes were very short about 17-22 minutes each."
1,"What about ""Thou Shalt Not Lie?""","This is the epitome of bad ""science.""I rented it to give it the benefit of the doubt. I should have saved my money. Obviously the director has little knowledge of geology, chemistry, plate tectonics, climatology, genetics, biology, etc. except what he thought sounded good to him. Ugh. What a disappointment."
1,festive but worthless,"I purchased two of these and took them on a flat water tubing trip. Within the first five minutes they filled with water and all the ice melted. Just to keep them afloat we had to keep emptying them out. Water even got trapped inside the cooler's supposedly insultated walls. I like the concept, but they obviously skipped the testing phase on these. Had the product development people actually taken the time think about it, a 10 cent O-ring probably would have done the trick."
2,Try something else,"This item looks cool and I received multiple compliments on it. Great, looks good but is it practical? Not so much. I took this cooler on a kayaking float, within 15 minutes on the water, all my ice melted. The cooler doesn't seal well, which lets water in. I had to make a ""pit stop"" and had to paddle my arms off to catch up to the others, due to the weight of the cooler being filled with water. I don't recomment it and would try something else."
2,Cheap,This cooler is cute but it is constructed with cheap plastic and will not last long in the pool or water - probably will leak very soon!Not worth 30 bucks - 10 maybe...
2,Use it as a decoration - not a cooler.,Great looking conversation piece. If you have a sport themed room or a man cave hang it somewhere or put it on a table to decorate the room. Maybe poolside for a party? If you want to take it somewhere and expect it to float while keeping your beverages/food cold - forget about it. I saw one hanging over the door of a fishing shop and knew right away why it was there as a decorative element and not being sold as a functioning item.
1,"Cute, but really a piece of junk","We bought this cooler for river tubing trips and it is worthless. It does float, but it doesn't seal and takes on water the whole time. You cannot open it without lifting it up and holding it outside of the water. The latch for opening the lid is really bad and you can't tell if it's closed or not. I accidentally dumped the entire contents of the cooler into the river at least three times on one trip. It's cute, but don't fall for the novelty because it doesn't actually work at all."
5,How to stop boat traffic!!,"I purchased this as a ""gag"" gift for my husband to pull behind his paddle boat. I had no idea what a hit it would be with his fellow boaters on the lake! It is cute, works well, and certainly stimulates a conversation among fellow boaters if you pull this behind your boat. Want a great conversation piece and some fun on the weekends - purchase this item!"
1,Not genuine leather.,"I am a long-time Amazon customer and recently began searching for leathermouse pads as gifts for my employees and our clients. Found this item andjust want to share a note of caution with you:Bonded Leather , or ""Reconstituted Leather"" is not really a true leatherbut a man-made material composed of 60% to 90% leather fibers (often scrapfrom leather tanneries). Bonded leather is not as durable as genuineleathers, and is recommended for use only if the product will be usedinfrequently. (data from WIKIPEDIA online)There are many true genuine leather mouse pads from other vendors and atbetter prices! Amazon may also have some, keep searching, but rememberonly the words ""GENUINE LEATHER"" or equal terminology should appear inthe description."
4,"Definitely, a song and album for everyone.","Rodney Franklin is one of those jazz artist who are very seldom talked about. This was one of his best recordings. This album should have been released on cd. ""A Song For You"" is one of those melodic tunes that you can just sit back and chill to, especially with that special someone and a glass of wine. Hopefully some record company will get the urge and release this title. Rodney Franklin was quite the pianist."
4,How long?,"I love ""Skydance"". The fact that I've been playing it on my turntable for the past quarter of a century should be proof enough of that.(In fact, I consider ""Skydance"" the perfect example of where the album that is released without any ""hits"" is so much better than the one that is labled, ""best of."")As much as I like my LP version, I, like the others who have made comments about ""Skydance"", would like to see it released on disk.Even better, make it a double album on one CD with ""Love Dancin'"".Whether it comes out as a single or double, fans of Mr. Franklin shouldn't have to wait any longer.The people have spoken. Release ""Skydance"" on CD."
4,Solid beginner information,Well written with many photos and a step-by-step guide for cloisonné. Sound advice and useful trouble shooting. It touches briefly on other techniques without enough detail information to use but enough to start an interest in expanding enamels and a few trial experiments.
2,not as good as it should be,"I would not recomend this book. The information that is in it is good. And it's nice that is has some projects to try, but there is nothing for a nonbeginer in this book. I've taken a few cloisonne classes, but they are hard to find I wanted to know more. I have had some problems and I hoped I could find answers to them in this book. There is no troubleshooting section, no comments even on how to fix the projects if something goes wrong. If your interest is anything other than curiosity for cloisonne, if you want to actually learn how to do this, DON'T bother geting this book."
2,Just too flimsy to rely on,"We travel in third world countries and ordered this to provide a little more security while we're sleeping. The materials used in this lock are just too flimsy to inspire much confidence. The main body is plastic. The metal bar which fits into the door jamb is thin and flexible so easily bends out of the way when pressure is put on the door. The serrations on the bar are not deep, so don't promise much strength. While none of these locks can be expected to withstand someone trying to kick the door in, this one, while prettily-designed is overly expensive and unimpressive. We're going to try a few others.By the way, in returning this item, which we consider unsatisfactory, Amazon will charge us doubly: the cost to return the item to Amazon and also charge us for what we originally saved with our ""Super Saver"" shipping. The end result is far from the full refund other merchants offer."
2,"better than nothing, at least until it breaks","I took this to SE Asia for a six-month trip. It's not easy to figure out how it works, which is unfortunate. But once it's in place it provides some comfort for those hotels where locks either don't exist or aren't trustworthy. After using it a handful of times, I couldn't get the red locking handle to close. I wiggled the metal bar and the red handle, trying not to apply much force. But I heard a crack from inside, and that was the end of that. Not recommended if you can find anything else."
1,"Pretty pictures, useless book","A written-by-committee book full of beautiful photographs, mostly of built-in bookshelves and cabinets.You'll get no help PLANNING a wall system. There are lots of photo examples in rooms with soaring twenty-foot ceilings. Lots of examples designed by architects and built in when the mansion was constructed. None of this will help plan a wall system in an average home.You'll get little or no help with BUILDING or DESIGNING a wall systems in an average home. The focus is on the pretty photos, the text is simply fill-in. No plans. No non-obvious design hints."
2,Only worth a quick glance,"Pluses: The book gives you a general overview of what types of wall systems are available.Minuses: the photos are mostly boring and/or outdated.Recommendation: Many of the books in the Ideas for Great series are useful. However, this book is not one of them. I would skip it or check it out from the library."
2,Poor viewing angles and lighting,"You have to be looking right straight dead on with this thing! The contrast and brightness is horrible. Hard to find a happy medium. You riase the brightness, becuase dark scenes look ""silver"" and are not viewable. The a scene with a lot of white in it comes on and the whole thing is washed out.Really would stay away from this one."
1,Short Term,"I purchased this monitor for use on our family vacation to Mazitlan. I was on a budget and this was one of the brands I could afford. I purchased on March, and yesterday the thing just gave out. I had a lot of trouble with the method of opening, which was a small push button that always seemed to jam. I had to use a credit card to slide through the gap to open. And it hangs cricked, the joint for folding has a lean to the right. I will not be cheao anymore and buy something worth my money."
4,Excellent short hike accessory,Enough space for lunch/snack and 2 water bottles that can be SECURED with band (important feature). Not enough space for jacket. Also useful for tourist out for a day trip. Excellent value at price of $15.
2,ELO FINAL SHOWDOWN,"FOR ME THIS IS NOT AN ELO CD !! IT'S ONLY A NEW JEFF LYNNE CD AFTER ARMCHAIR THEATER..THE MUSICIANS ARE NOT QUALIFIED AS WAS WITH BEV BEVAN, RICHARD TANDY, KELLY GROUCUTT, MELVYN GALE, MIK KAMINSKY AND HUGH MAC DOWELL.....IF THIS IS THE WAY ELO MUSIC IS MEANT TO BE FOR THE REST OF THE MILLENNIUM....WE'D BETTER GIVE IT UP ......"
3,Classic Jeff Lynne but...,"The music is very good. The biggest problem I have is, why didn't Jeff Lynne consider this a solo project. Maybe he consulted with the others and they said they didn't want to reunite, I don't know. If Mik (his playing is trademark ELO!)and Bev played on this album, then I would accept it as an ELO album and I would have given it AT LEAST 1 more star. Mik and Bev were respectful to the original band when they formed a new group, so they called themselves ELO II. They could have called themselves simply ELO but realized it wasn't the same group. (or maybe legally Jeff prevented them from doing that, again I don't know) I'm also not crazy about the radio-friendly 3 1/2 minute songs either, not very creative. Other than that, a very solid Jeff Lynne solo effort that brings back fond memories of ELO."
3,Where is the orchestra?,"What always made ELO special was the orchestral arrangements. These are very promising songs that are packaged well for Lynne's talents. The problem is that it's all Jeff Lynne singing and playing virtually every part, albeit with guest appearances by Ringo Starr and George Harrison, a couple of songs with cellos in the background, and a couple of songs with a hint of string accompaniment. I felt a little ""taken"" by the cover marketing proclaiming this was ""ELO."" It's really just a Jeff Lynne solo album with a little outside help. To sum up, I really miss the strings, and it's sorry to see that Lynne gave up on integrating them into his music."
3,NOT ELO,"I know, I know... Jeff Lynne is ELO. Everyone seems to say that. Well, that's not really true. The other players in this ""orchestra"" all played instruments and sang harmonies. The real ELO had a certain sound. A certain style. Yes, Lynne wrote all the songs. But, the other players added the spices to this music recipe. Without Tandy, Groucutt, etc, it's really not ELO. This is a good release for Jeff Lynne. But, please, let's be fair to the public. This is false representation. Maybe it would've been more appropriate if Lynne called this ELO 3."
5,AWESOME ALBUM,"This album has that signature Jeff Lynne sound immediately. As for the individual who says he feels he's ""been ripped off"", I respect his opinion but, if you listen to the album before reading the liner notes and the new ELO lineup you would never know this was not the original group. Lynne's vocals are as polished and melodic as ever. I actually bought the ZOOM Tour Live dvd initially and was so impressed with the new material I had to have the studio version of ZOOM. Put your blindfolds on and give it a listen. If this band does not sound like the ELO of decades gone by to you, I apologize to you for wasting your time to read it took to read this. Definately 5 *****s. Thanks, I hope this helpful for you. GED"
5,Are You Tired of ELO? I am not!,"I think it's great that the giants of the 1970's should still be able to muster the energy, the motivation and new ideas to embark on tours and albums and such adventures (from time to time).Musically, this album is nothing groundbreaking ... just a toned-down, de-big-fiddled, de-discofied ELO. A kind of unobtrusive, well-made music that's not going to move mountains or change cultural landscapes (anymore). But, you can still listen to it once in a while --- or twice a week, if you are a hard-core ELO fan."
4,It's Alright,"When you see an old flame after twenty years, there's a great deal of trepidation. After all, they've changed; you've changed. What still remains of what you once shared? It's sort of an encounter with yourself as you were back then. As a genuine ELO fan in my day, listening to ZOOM was this sort of experience. I almost wish I didn't know when I heard it that it's basically Jeff Lynne playing all the parts. Maybe it's me, but there seems to be a sameness to the sound. Flawless, but all the same. I really miss the band. However, the tunes are pretty good in a mellow sort of way. There are some real gems here, like ""Just for Love"" and ""It Really Doesn't Matter"", but nothing really knocks your socks off. I came away with the feeling that Jeff Lynne's back, but not ELO."
3,"Good, but too safe","This is a good cd but it lacks a knock out song. All the usual suspects are here, the hooks, the endless layering of vocals, but this cd lacks a focus. It is a gathering of songs that although are good seem to blend together in a sort of vocal orgy. No ""Last Train"" here. Not that I expected it but we as ELO Fans deserve it. Except for the first and last song, the order isn't really pertanent, they are generally interchangeable. Still, Jeff Lynne is Jeff Lynne and I'm happy to the get the disc, regardless."
3,"Good, not great","As many reviewers have already noted, this is far more a Jeff Lynne solo album than an ELO album. Seeking to integrate influences from Tom Petty, George Harrison, and others with whom he has worked with the past fifteen years, Lynne has put together an album full of consistently enjoyable pop ditties. Having said that, there is no sure-fire hit on board this one, nothing that soars as high as ELO's classic work of the late 70's. Here's hoping this is just a tune-up in expectation of a full-fledged ELO album in the near future."
4,ORCHESTRA? Where? More like JEFF LYNNE & FRIENDS!,"And that's not all bad!VERY BEATLESQUE. And how could it not be, with GEORGE HARRISON and RINGO STARR performing on this recording. Do you like THE BEATLES?, GEORGE HARRISON?, RINGO STARR? If so, you should like this CD!VERY POP MUSIC. And how could it not be, with JEFF LYNNE's ability to write a catchy tune and with PATTY SPRINGSTEEN performing on this recording. Do you like POP MUSIC? If so, you should like this CD!NATURAL PROGRESSION FROM ELO's ""OUT OF THE BLUE"" RECORDING. Do you like the songs on ""OUT OF THE BLUE""? If so, you should like this CD!NOT AT ALL LIKE ELO's ""A NEW WORLD RECORD"" RECORDING. If you like ""A NEW WORLD RECORD"", then you may be disappointed with this CD. Be cautious and listen to the sound clips first.DO YOU LIKE TAP DANCING? Well, O.K. maybe I'm getting carried away here.BOTTOM LINE: ""ZOOM"" is A HIGHLY RECOMMENDED listening pleasure. ENJOY!"
4,Oh Yea!!!,"I got this cd based on someone's recommendation and it is in my top 10 of 2001. I had always been an ELO fan from earlier cds but in my opinion this is probably( and I'm sure ther will be those who disagree) the most consistent effort of Jeff Lynne's formidable career. Put on a set of headphones and kick back and prepare to smile! The disc is loaded with great song after great song. If you have never bought any ELO boy are you in for a treat, and if you are already an ELO fan do you have a reason to cheer. As usual I would rate this 4and a half stars but there isn't a selection for that. At any rate this is a top 10 release for 2001-no question about it."
3,Not quite ELO,"I love Jeff Lynne but it was the dynamic between the members of ELO that made that band what it was.Anything that Jeff Lynne touches sounds amazing (Tom Petty, George Harrison & Ringo production work as an example) but to call this an ELO project? I don't know...I don't think I'll be picking this one up. It just sounds a little too Wilbury-ish with Jeff singing all the songs minus the benefit of the other Wilburys singing any leads."
3,Not good for ELO,"This album has a few good songs, but most of it sounds lame. The title track Alright is the best on this album and the rest isn't really worth listening. This doesn't sound like the previous ELO."
1,Zoom,"I agree with Aaron Deschanel in his review of the new ELO album Zoom. There are only three tunes that would have been good enough for the ""B"" side of an older ELO single. I will still listed to the old ELO on CDs and on elotunes on Live 365, but once was enough for Zoom"
1,What a con !,There is no ORCHESTRA on this ....simply a Jeff Lynne solo album. A total waste of cash. Do not buy.
3,"ELO: Lit again, but dimming","It's always good to hear new material from Jeff Lynne, but it's nothing we haven't heard before. People will recognize songs sounding like ""Four Little Diamonds"" (Easy Money), or the ballads from Out Of The Blue (For Your Love). Nothing that is here is bad per se. It's just that it has that feeling of being recycled."
5,Welcome Back ELO!,"""It's over, and what can I do?""That sure was my feeling going all these years without a fresh dose of ELO. I was jumping out of my armchair when in anticipation of this new CD.Now that it's here, I can say that it certainly does not disappoint. The sound and harmonies are unmistakeably Jeff Lynne. There may not be as much string treatment but the sound still sounds like an ""orchestra"" with the intertwining instruments and the background harmonies flowing along with it. The lyrics have a real world quality to them as opposed to the surreal dreaminess of ELO in the past. I attribute this to collaborations Lynne has had with the Travelling Wilbury's, Randy Newman, and the plethora of other musicians. If you're an ELO/Jeff Lynne fan, by all means, buy this CD. If you are looking to recapture ELO of the '70's, this isn't for you, this is ELO of the 21'st century"
4,It's About Time!,"This is the first release from any group in a long time that I was impressed by because the entire disc is strong, not just a couple tracks. I never understood how Jeff Lynne walked away from his past. I'm glad to have him back. Zoom is light on strings compared to earlier albums but it leaves no doubt its ELO and and that Lynne is ELO. After all these years,I'm still knocked out by the quality of his songwriting. Some of the song hooks makes the hair stand up on my arms! What a talent. I wish I could say the same for alot of the stuff thats coming out these days that they call music. Zoom is well worth the cost if you miss real music."
3,Very good but missing something,"I eagerly purchased this disc with much anticipation, and was ultimately disappointed upon first listen. The album doesn't really sound like ELO, or at least the ELO I was wanting to revisit. I miss the strings, for one thing. And the harmonies, while undeniably ELO-ish, could use a little more depth, probably because all the voices are pretty much Jeff Lynne's. In fact, the whole album is really more of a Jeff Lynne solo project than a real ELO album. None of the songs set my pulse racing or my feet dancing.Having said all that, it is a well produced, well-performed and well-written album that does indeed grow on you. But it doesn't really rock. Or dance. Or grab your heart. Maybe in time I'll grow to love it, as I have much of ELO's 1980's work (which has been unfairly trashed by the critics)."
3,"I wish I could rate it higher, but it's not honest music","Anyone buying this expecting ELO is going to be disappointed. I am a HUGE ELO fan and I was ecstatic to see a new CD. Of course, as others have mentioned, it isn't really ELO, but Jeff Lynne. While he was the creative genius and the voice of ELO, he wasn't the whole band. Listening to the tracks brings you back to the days when they used to produce new music on a regular basis, but knowing that Bev Bevan isn't doing the drums and Richard Tandy isn't at the keyboard and the rest aren't in the music gives the CD a bitter taste. Like a previous reviewer said, it sure seems like Jeff didn't think he would sell as many albums if he put out another solo release, so he pirated the ELO name for his own profit. Pretty sad."
3,Wilburys Vol 5,"I hesitated to give this CD only three stars because it IS a good album. Sadly, it just isn't an ELO album. I've always believed that while Jeff Lynne handled all the writing, lead vocals and guitar, he was only about 75% of ELO. What's sorely missing here is Richard Tandy--who only appears buried deep in one song--and Louis Clark's string arrangements--who is probably permanently estranged from Lynne for working with ELO Part 2. Hoping Jeff will see the ""Light"" for the next outing."
3,"Sometimes the truth hurts, at least to write it.","I'm a huge fan of ELO. I've got all the ELO studio albums, the Xanadu soundtrack, and even some of the less known live ELO albums and the more recent ""ELO II"" stuff. I love classic ELO at that's all there is to it.The problem with this album is that although it certainly has the ELO style (being a Jeff Lynne album essentially), there's nothing so moving or memorable to me that I ever really miss it or want to listen to it again. I'm not ever sure where my copy is. So, I was built up for a let down.Now, if you don't already have the Zoom DVD, that's worth getting! You get to see what the album tour would have looked like and hear what it would have sounded like, and you get a lot of tunes from this CD performed live and a lot of ELO classics too."
2,Nothing new on this album.,"The use of the name ""ELO"" is probably purely for marketing reasons, for this is nothing more than Jeff's second solo album. Heck, he plays about everything himself. Worse than that, Jeff hasn't made any musical progress since 1985 at all. This album could very well be a sibling of George Harrison's Cloud Nine, which bears Jeff's marks all over it, too. Gone is the fiery spirit of albums such as Time and Secret Messages; what remains are standard 4/4 rock songs. The album has surprisingly little variation in song styles; there isn't a single song that doesn't use guitars and drums. If Jeff feels he has something to say to the world musically speaking, that's fine, but don't launch it as a new ELO album, for I'm much too fond of the old ELO albums to consider this another one. ELO finished about 1985, and it should have been left at that. New releases of bands who were successful twenty years are seldom a success now, and ELO won't be an exception I think."
2,Big disappointment,"Being a fan of Electric Light Orchestra and Jeff Lynne for many years, I was waiting with great expectations this new ELO? CD. Previous ELO music was fascinating, great vocal and orchestral arrangements. But this recording came to be an amalgalm of different styles used by Lynne through the years, except almost no orchestra or vocal arrangements, the things that made ELO music so enjoyable. I listened this disc five times, waiting to discover some 'magic' in it, but at the end I was frustrated. This record is boring and the songs very predictable from beginning to end; 'Moment in paradise',maybe, the only exception.This record was really a Electric Light record (no orchestra). I hope the next one go back to the basics."
4,elo kiddies,""" why did i buy this?"" i ask myself.""is it because i am stupid?""""is it because i once liked elo?"""" why do i like this?"" i ask myself.""is it because i'm stupid?""no it's because it's good."
3,"Solid Effort by Lynne, but absolutely out of date.","After 10 years the first Lynne Album. Always liked him and have most of his records. So I read the reviews here and got the album.The nice thing: Right from the first chord the old ELO feeling is back. Nothing has changed.The bad thing: Absolutely nothing has changed. Song-writing, Production, Singing, Instruments, everything is defintitvely late-70ies standard. Zoom even goes further back than the records after Discovery. An uninformed listener would definitvely guess that it is actually an old ELO record. That should be ok, but even the sound sounds as damp as a 70ies record, which is not ok, by any standard. Besides this, there are no surprises tunewise. Everything here you've heard before, and most of the times in a better song.The main weakness: No real hitsingle. So this will stay a nice nostalgic trip. Listen to it a few times, just to get in the mood to order Flashback, the retro-collection. That's were the really interesting stuff is."
5,ELO Zoom CD,Super fast delivery and excellent product (this CD was recommended by a coworker). The CD was everything I expected and more! Thanks again for enhancing my music collection!!!
3,I Guess It Grows On You,"I had really looked forward to hearing this album. First time through I was a bit disappointed - I had hoped for less of the 50's-style (rockabilly? ""Roll Over Beethoven"" and the like...) music that characterized some of ELO's earlier work and more of what caught my attention the first time around (""Face the Music,"" ""A New World Record,"" & ""Out of the Blue""). Also, I can't say that I enjoy the gratuitous use of even 1 profanity (please note, I did say ""gratuitous"").However, subsequent ""go-thrus"" has this CD growing on me. Jeff Lynne is a talented musician. Hope to hear more from him."
3,Zoom,"Jeff Lynne is a dignified tunesmith who was a very prominent music force in the seventies. There's no question that he can write a great song-hook, line and sinker! But I have a little problem with the ethics of this release. Even though Jeff Lynne was ELO, this really should be a Jeff Lynne solo release. Not ELO. He's probably recreated the ELO sound to an acceptable level. But, like Coca Cola, ELO was a distinctive product that you simply can't copy unless you have ALL the ingredients. Most of ELO's players aren't on this release. It seems to me that Jeff Lynne has simply used the ELO name to sell his product. Okay, the first 5 songs are excellent! But, it pretty much goes down hill for the rest of the cd. Don't get me wrong, if you liked ELO and/or the Traveling Wilburys, you'll also like this. But don't think you're going to be getting ELO, circa 2001. You're not. This is just Jeff Lynne and friends. For me, it was well worth it."
5,"OK IT'S PRETTY MUCH A JEFF LYNNE SOLO PROJECT, BUT WHO CARES!","Just got this cd the other day, and all I can say is WOW! I was really surprised how pretty solid this album is. From the beginning track, Jeff Lynne hooks you in. My personal favorite "" STRANGER ON A QUIET STREET"" is a real treat. Jeff Lynne, to me, brings the great ELO sound back. And rightfully so. Great cd! And I highly recommend it! Hope Jeff Lynne does more in the future and soon!Highlights: ""ALRIGHT"",""MOMENT IN PARADISE"",""JUST FOR LOVE"",""STRANGER ON A QUIET STREET"", and ""LONESOME LULLABY"""
4,More than Alright,"This album shows ELO coming back full stride with most of the songs being well above avarage. Jeff is in control playing most of the instruments and pilots the ship into mostly great space. I should point out that George Harrison, Ringo Starr and Richard Tandy are some of the musicians the make guest appearences on here. The disc starts off wit the upbeat rocker Alright and before you know it, your foot is tapping right along. Moment In Paradise is something that would've fit in well onSecret MessagesWhile songs like State Of Mind, Easy Money and Lonesome Lullaby rock. The disc also has pretty ballads like Just For Love on it. If you like the ELO of the '70's and '80's, this will be right up your ally."
4,Jeff Lynne still sounds great,"ELO's newest release, ""Zoom"", is a refreshing album in an artifical music world. What I really love about the album is that Jeff Lynne still has some semblance of his trademark voice. Being a long-time ELO fan, it does not disappoint. Usually a fan of band that has been around for more than 15 years would say, ""I liked their old stuff, but their new stuff disappoints."" Not so with ELO. Each era of the band's history has something to offer and ""Zoom"" does not disappoint. From more up-tempo numbers like ""Alright"", ""State of Mind"", and ""Easy Money"", to meaningful songs like ""Moment in Paradise"", and ""Lonesome Lullaby"" make this an album that fits any mood. While I was somewhat disappointed in the abscence Lynne's trademark experimentations with sound and lack of orchestral accompaniment, I found it nevertheless to be an enjoyable listening experience. A worthy addition to an ELO collection."
2,disappointed,"This harness looked like exactly what we wanted, however, the small size was far too small for our dog. We tried the medium. That turned out to be far too large. Even though the harness is adjustable there is a rather large gap between sizes."
4,"good product, poor sizing availible","I like this product, but be aware the sizing could be an issue. I have a Corgi and his girth measures 22-23"", which shows as a medium, but it was too loose and too long for him. It was so long it covered his privates, and so loose he could catch his rear foot in it. So,I tried the small, and as I feared it is too tight around girth. The difference between the small and medium is substantial. The small would be snug on a Dachshund and the medium looks like it would be loose on a Labrador! It's a shame because I really like the design. So be aware, it definitly does not fit a Corgi!"
3,Dog Harness,"This product Safety Seat Vest Harness - Small is very desirable. Unfortunately, it is incorrectly advertised because it comes in many sizes, and the criterion for choosing the size is WRONG. We have returned the product, which is too small for our dog, and hope the vendor sends the correct size to us based on the specifications we sent the vendor. The loss is shipping expense and time.The manufacturer says the small size is for dogs weighing between 15 and 30 pounds. Our dog weighs 22 pounds, and the rear straps for the small size are about five inches too short."
5,Great Car Harness for Dogs,"I have been using this harness for over a year now and it's great. A lot of other car harness' out there buckle into a seatbelt-- but it's just a strap hooked into the seatbelt receiver. This harness is put on the dog and then the full seatbelt is fed through a loop & plugged into the seatbelt receiver. This allows for a safer ride because the dog doesn't have as much roaming ability. Still enough movement for the dog to sit, lay down, and sniff out the window. Four paws gets five stars!"
5,sturdy secure harness,I've used these harnesses before and a new dog chewed his all up and I ordered this one to replace it. They are comfortable for the dog to wear and they are very secure for the dog. I'll continue to use this style harness for my dogs.
2,Did not last long-,My dog outgrew it at once and broke the harness. Not a good material. Found a better one at a cheaper price at walmart.
2,Not a great restraint,This would not fit my dogs. they were within the weight requirements but they are little wide bodies (Scottish Terriers).Even so I did not like the way this harness attached to the seat belt system.
5,The Best Harness Yet,"I tried other harness, but for my 2 dogs, one 65 pounds and the other 81 pounds, nothing seems to work until I found this harness. Now they travel very comfy and very well protected and I don't have to worry about them. It is very well constructed and padded in the right places. I love it and most important my dogs love it too!!"
2,Beware of Sizing,"This item looks great, but the sizing indicated on the website is way off. I purchased the Small for my dog, and he should have fit into it by several lbs. according to the fitting guide. He did not. I returned the harness, but they apparently did not have a medium available, because the vendor choose to return the money rather than replace the harness with a larger size."
2,SAFETY SEAT VEST HARNESS (MEDIUM) BLACK,HARNESS NEEDS LOOP THAT GOES IN CIRCLES - OTHERWISE THE HARNESS TWISTS ALL UP IN THE SEATBELT AND TURNS ALL COCKEYED ON THE DOG.
2,Sizes aren't appropriate.....too loose!,"We first purchased this harness in size small for our 31 lb rescue dog. Couldn't get the waist part around her. Sent it back (different vendor) and purchased the medium. This one is so much larger, that she easily slips her legs out and around. First time we tried in in the car, she did so many flips (as it was so loose and yes, we adjusted it down as far as it would go) that she had horrible twists in everything, she might have strangled herself. We had to undo all the straps and seat belt to untangle it all. Would not purchase the product or recommend it to anyone, but the vendor was very prompt in getting it to us."
2,Sizing is off. Neck hole is too small with no give.,"One of the few vest harnesses with a D-ring leash attachment. Strong and sturdy. However, recommended sizing on package is completely wrong. Had to go through all 3 sizes in order to find one to fit a 22 inch long, 22 lb. dog. Large is too big. Medium is too big. Small is too big and the neck hole is too small with no give. Larger sizes have scratchy fake fleece lining. Made in China."
3,needs a bit more,"I bought this hoping to kee my dog secure and it does, but the way the seat belt lies across his back to attach to the harness is not comfortable for him. Especially since he likes to change his position between lying down and sitting up frequently. The harness needs a bit of an extra loop for the seat belt to go through which I am going to try to add to it myself."
3,size -elastic stretches too much,"the small is not adjustable up front, so my beagle slides through it and the harness ends up around his hips. I have the large one for my 70lb dog and it has lasted several years, if they made the front part adjustable instead of elastic it would be a 5 instead of a 3. The large one I definitely rate a 5."
5,Hot Pink Half Sarong,I purchased 3 of these sarongs as gifts for my bridesmaids (and myself!) for a destination wedding in Mexico. The color is true to the picture and they are of great quality. I haven't had any problems with dye running when wet or washed. The girls loved them!
5,I'm Smart NOW!!!,"Awesome book, currently using it to help me in my Genetics class. Really helps me get the point!"
3,a bit out of date,"If you have any interest in an overview, this book has real limitations. The comments on the central dogma are out-of-date and incorrect. In the list of ten defining events in genetics, one has to search to find the names Watson and Crick buried at the end of a section. Surely, not what they deserve."
4,Useful information,I purchased this book for a LIfelong Learning class in genetics. It provided a helpful background to the lectures and class discussions. The presenters are sending findings of errors and typos to the publisher. The book is best for those with little background but serious desire to understand. It would be better not to have so many errors.
3,Decent headband though a bit pricey,"I purchased this headband for use in my kickboxing class in which the instructor likes to keep the heat on between 80 to 85 degrees so I'm constantly wiping sweat out of my face. I use an Under Armour heat-gear compression shirt and that works wonders in wicking away sweat from my body. However, this sweat band doesn't really do too great of a job probably because it's a pretty thin strip of material although I do wipe my face maybe 40% less than I do without it. I also purchased the regular Under Armour cotton headband and it honestly does a much better job at half the price so I'd recommend that or any other cotton headband over this one."
4,My boys are happy,These wheels appear to be working out fine. My boys don't really give me detailed answers to questions. The only problem was that I ordered white and they sent me black.
3,QUALITY ? HELLO PRODUCER ??,"wow. after being a huge fan for about 10 years now, (since ""point of view"" was a featured video on headbanger's ball) i was extremely happy to see these guys perform live, but i was upset at the quality of this DVD, and the length.forget about bonus material... forget about 5.1 , or even halfway decent mixing...HOWEVER, any DVD with fates playing is welcome in my collection. i think they should've combined the ""pleasant shade of grey"" vid (VHS) on this DVD to be worth the price... ray alder is the man, as is mark zonder, and matheos. very nice guys, and even better (UNDER-RATED AS HELL) musicians. this isn't D.T. quality ""scenes from NY"", rather a ""camcorder-esque"" version of the DYNAMO open air fest with fates warning. ... production, weird sound morphing, but if you are a die-hard fan, buy it...i hear they are making another DVD, with studio footage from the disconnected sessions, and more... i can't wait!"
3,decent pro shot footage of FW,"this DVD is not so bad. It is a pro shot from the concert. It looks like the Dynamo festival had a few cameramen film the entire festival and this is the FW footage. There is not too many pro shots of FW so you take what you get. Casual fans may not like this but die hards will want this. The audio is ok, could be better, sounds like a soundboard mix. Their Live in Athens DVD is way better but this is nice to add to the small FW dvd discography."
5,Danzas Puertorriquenas,"I have been looking for danzas puertoriquenas, for a long time and to my surprise you had it. These are beautiful. I recommed them to all who love latin music with and old time twist. This a wonderful CD, which can be enjoyed even if not Puertorican or Latin."
1,vinegar and water is much better,I bought this at Home Depot. Used it for about 20 minutes and wasn't getting very far. Then I remembered that vinegar can be used. I went on the Internet and Googled it. It said to mix white vinegar and water in a 1:1 mix. It worked 100 times better than this stuff. Save your money and your time and use vinegar and water in a 1:1 mix. You will be glad you did.
5,Relief!!!,This product really works well for me. I fall asleep quickly and I don't wake up feeling weird.
2,Boring!!!,"This book was as interesting as...well...traveling down the river and watching the scenery roll by for six weeks. Which is what the characters did, and what the author felt the need to portray in excrutiating detail. I'm sorry, but there's nothing about working on a riverboat, even as a ""cub"" to the captain, that is the slightest bit interesting, especially in what's supposed to be a romance novel! I have no idea why the author felt this aspect of the story would be compelling.I agree with other reviewers that, although this is erotica and therefore expected to be fantasy based, the heroine's lax sexual mores were completely unbelievable for the times. The sex scenes were repetitive and uninventive. The hero was emotionally uncompelling.In short, this book was a definite letdown after Irish Devil."
3,Hard to care about characters,"Took me a long time to finish this book, as it just did not hold my attention. Convincing that the lead female can trick most of the males into thinking she is herself a man who loves to gamble did not fly with me.Yes, well written intimate sections, although they seemed to be a nice reprieve through reading the story instead of flowing with it.I appreciated the historical information of the period or era, and liked the locale of being on a river boat.Still, I can't hate it or love it."
1,Poor effort,"Book turned me off quite quickly, and it is a shame. The plot had real possibilities, until the author felt obligated to insert copious physiological sexual reactions in every possible situation. Very, very sexually overdone. One can buy a sex manual if necessary, without ruining literature to be read for enjoyment. And, by the way, some of the description is anatomically improbable or impossible."
2,I'm no prude but this book reads like soft porn!,"The story itself was all over the place. It seemed to jump around quite a bit and sometimes I was unable to follow and had to go back and reread which is rare for me.I enjoy steamy romance novels, but the detailed descriptions during the sex acts (and there seemed to be an overabundance of them), was a shock to say the least. I may as well go buy a copy of Hustler if I want to read erotic stories with THAT kind of language.I got this in a group of trade books and this will be my last time to read anything by this author. It wasn't that great of a story line and I can find more entertaining books to read without all the trashiness."
1,tedious and dull,"Dull, dull, dull. If I'd wanted a course in how to pilot a steamboat, I'd have signed up for one. I don't expect it in a romance novel. Or excuse me, erotica novel though even that part of it got boring as well and when the sex scenes make my eyes glaze over, it's time to jump ship"
1,sorry to have to say...,"I read the reviews and was really looking forward to reading the book. I found it confusing and hard to follow from the very start AND it went down hill from there!!! No chemistry, unlikeable, unbelievable characters. I skimmed just to finish it, did not enjoy any part of the book!"
1,Another Mormon Myth,"I am a descendant of Porter Rockwell and have studied his life and Mormon History to the best of my capabilities. The only simularities between this movie and the truth is that, yes, there is a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there was a Prophet Brigham Young, and there was a devout Porter Rockwell. But that's about it. Even many non-Mormon scholars believe the ""Danites"" probably never existed but was just another made up scam by early anti-Mormon presses, and in true Hollywood style every thing once written must have been true. Creativity is much easier this way. I wouldn't waste your time on this B-movie if I were you, it's like going to a Ford dealer to buy a Chevy ( it would save you a lot of time just going to source )."
5,Amazing movie,"I wanted this movie and I could not find it, except on video tape. I was so happy to find it here on amazon, so I placed the order immediately, the price was good enough for something that I wanted for a long time."
4,Great insight into the Oracle from Omaha,Reading this answered a lot of questions I had about Warren Buffett. Some of the things he says and does in public just don't quite mesh with a person who is a multibillionaire. There are some very surprising things in here about his personal life as well. Well worth the read.
4,This is how genius works ...,"There are about a million investing books out there, none of which are written by Buffet, that all claim to help you get inside the head of (or learn the investing strategies of) Warren Buffet. I wouldn't waste my time with about 99% of them - but this biography is worth the read in my opinion.I read this biography about a year ago and thoroughly enjoyed it, and also came away feeling like I learned something.If you're at all interested in Buffet, this should be a relatively interesting, easy read. But more importantly to me, as an investor, this biography provides some useful insight into how Buffet works, how he thinks, how he operates, and how he invests.Whether you're interested in Buffet or you simply want to learn something about the mind of a great value investor, I'd recommend Lowenstein's ""Buffet: The Making of an American Capitalist""."
4,Excellent!...as a biography...,"I bought this book because it was one on a recommended reading list for investing. Well, while the book was great and entertaining, I'm not trying to read for entertainment purposes.That said, if you are looking to read a book about Warren Buffett, his life, career, family, etc. then this is a great biography. If you want an investment guide, don't look here."
5,Excellent biography,"This is an excellent and sometime inspirational biography. Lowenstein writes so well that it's a genuine pleasure to read. Many biographies get bogged down in details, or spend many pages on irrelevant details. This one moves along at a brisk pace, giving the reader an excellent understanding of the man and his beliefs. I encourage anyone with even a passing interest in Warren Buffet to read this."
5,Excellent,"Well researched, analyzed, and written.I see why Buffett was silently acceptive in autographing it. Superb job in reporting both analytical economics and personal life. Truth.I will read more from this author."
5,Excellent story on how Buffet built an empire from nothing.,"As a novice investor, I found this story to be a very good lesson on how to value companies and ultimately stocks. As an unexpected bonus, it turned out to be an engaging story of one man's life from paperboy to becoming the wealthiest man in America. I bought it as a reference book of sorts and turned out to have acquired an entertaining story as well."
4,An exelent account. Could do with slightly more on the deals,A very good book. You feel as though you have listed to a great teacher as you read this account
5,My favorite book on Buffett,This is a great read and is my favorite book on Warren Buffett. You learn a great deal about the foundation behind his success.
5,Unique account of Buffett's rise to financial stardom,"A rare account of Buffett's life and financial ventures, detailing several milestones in the evolution of Buffett from wiz kid to financial guru."
2,more romance than investment lessons,"If you are looking for a romantic story about Warren Buffet's life, this is the right book for you. If you're looking for clear cut investment lessons from a great investor, buy The Warren Buffet Way written by Hagstrom."
5,learn to get rich,"This book was first published in 1995, at that time, i was studying in NYU. I bought a book about warren buffett to study at that time. However, I didn't pay serious to my studying, I just read it as an interest or for fun. (I am not a smart and hardworking student, and at that time, I thought I am hard working enough)I started to learn buffett seriously in 2007 and unfortunately, I still lost a battle in 2008 crisis.16 years later, now, I read this book. If I would read this book in an early time, I am sure I won't got hit so bad in stock market and I would be richer than I am now.so, this is a book to learn the life of warren buffett, from his childhood till 1994. If u want to be rich, u got to read this book immediately and for many times. U can also learn how to behave correctly, how to become a lovely person. Remember, never too late. (I am a HK guy)"
4,Excellent Biography,This is an excellent biography of Warren Buffett's life and why and how he has become the incredible person he is today. It is interesting and also well-written. It could make you an investor if you are not already one.
4,Decent Overview of Buffett History,"This Audiobook, unfortunately on cassette, not CD, is a decent overview of early Buffett history. Lowenstein writes a coherent history of Buffett's major investments up through 1994. I found the part covering his childhood and investing beginnings most interesting. Buffett truly was a self-made man, starting out with paper routes and small businesses in Omaha.The narrator does a good job reading the book.This is a history of Buffett with very little discussion of his investment process - the author does not claim to teach you how to invest like Buffett. If you are interested in a general summary of early Buffett history, this is a good way to get it. The only negative is Lowenstein is so enamored with his subject that we only hear how brilliant Buffett is, without hearing of his mistakes."
5,Get In Line For This Buffett AND GET FED!!!,"This is a biography. It talks about his parents, what he was like as a kid and how he got where he is today. It is college level reading, but flows nicely. Specific chapters fill us in in detail about some of the more complex times in his life like the beginnings of Berkshire and being investigated by the SEC.I've liked the book. I'm not quite done, but it's kept my interest for like 500 pages - and that's not easy (if you knew me)."
1,"Exercises, but no plan","A list of exercises, alot like I see in aerobics classes, but no real plan for golf. I've seen most of these before, not really anything new. I picked up 2 really beneficial exercises out of the whole list."
4,Convenient With Little Invested!,"Being able to do this program from the privacy of my own home or office is a dream! My initial investment in the equipment needed was less than $200. Health clubs are too crowded and expensive for my taste, so this program, dare I say.....fits me to a tee!"
3,Exercises for Elite Golf Performance,"My family always gives me golf related gifts for my birthday, but this book is by far the best golf gift yet. Finally, an easy to follow exercise regimen tailored just for me and my game!This golf gift will be one that I can use over and over."
2,Small overpriced book,"I purchased this thinking it was a normal sized book. It is a tiny 4""x6"" book that can be purchased locally for less. The 12 stickers are ok."
4,Good quality stickers,Realistic pictures of actual trains which my 5 year old grandson likes as he is beginning to tire of all things Thomas.
5,Great replacement battery,"Obviously, you can't beat this price. What an incredible deal! This replacement battery performs just as well as the original. I have no complaints."
2,Not Impressed,"Replaced my 5.5year old OEM battery which was down to getting 5 complete days of standby without any usage with this battery and now I still get 5 complete days of standby. The battery works, fits easily but appears to have rather unimpressive capacity."
5,good battery,got this battery for the LG C2000. the stock battery was pretty much dead. I was hoping to get this battery cheaper but this was probably the best deal I found. seems to be holding charge well
3,Ghost Hunters Live Special,"The DVD case was broken. The prongs that hold the DVD in case were broken, so the DVD was sliding around in the case. The DVD was only a little scratched, and it only effected the DVD a little bit when it was played. It was a little disappointing that the case was broken, but it was still overall in good condition."
3,Don't buy this 'used'.,"I assume people get a bad dvd and return it to the store and it is later resold as used. My copy broke down into squares and was unwatchable for large parts. Also, they should have played up on the great atmosphere, history and architecture at Waverly more. But it was still a good way to pass an evening, if you need to catch up on the laundry or dusting. (In retrospect, I'd bump this to four stars. I'm not a believer, but it's fun to watch.) I guess we can all only have one Season One in life... (Plus, you get to see Jason and Grant traverse the ""Death Tunnel"" at midninght on Halloween. I probably wouldn't do that alone, no matter how sceptical I was... ;)"
3,was ok,there wasnt that much activty that you saw them capture on tape.you didnt get to see some of the stuff they saw and since you werent there you didnt get to feel what they felt. some of the stuff that was heard by them i heard a little but mainly i didnt really hear anything ether.i did see a few things though and i liked being able to see some. in parts it reminded me of a scary movie and just waiting for the bad guy to jump out.there was one funny thing that happened with the big wrestler dude in this at the end of the investigation.i dont blame him though if it had happened to me id of done the same.still pretty good. i have seen this show before and i saw the episode they explored this place before so i know stuff is there and i do belive they felt and saw stuff. its just hard since not all of them had cameras looking in all the directions cuse alot of the time the camera man was focusing on them and not looking where they were looking. anyway still ok
3,Good General Book,"I liked this book and it is a good general book for job hunting. If you are targeting a specific industry though, it is better to find a book that is industry specific and will help you get a job in that industry."
4,"The New Job Hunter's ""Bible""","""Job Hunting For Dummies"" is an easy-to-read book that spells out the most effective ways to find a job and it does so in a clear and concise manner. Even in the best of times, the job market is an imbroglio that is difficult to navigate and that is why JHFD is a must-read for all job hunters.Although job hunting is serious business, JHFD adeptly uses humor for comic relief as well as to emphasize a point. The section on actual resume' and job interview miscues is both funny and cautionary; readers would do well to take note.Of all the job hunting books I've read, JHFD is clearly the best. While Richard Nelson Bolles' ""What Color Is Your Parachute?"" has been acclaimed as the job hunter's ""bible,"" I know from experience that it is a tedious and often contradictory piece of work that has outlived its usefulness. Accordingly, job hunters should consider bypassing ""Parachute"" in favor of JHFD as it has more to offer its readers."
2,Job Hunting for Dummies,Did not realize when I ordered that this was the tiny version. Not the big book version. No information on this in listing.....abbreviated version; not what I had expected or hoped for whenI ordered it.....
1,Used Book received in poor condition,"I have ordered a few used books through Amazon.com and have had good luck with the purchase. This book I decided to try and when I received the book it was in really bad shape. It was not worth the price of a used book. I did not expect the book to be in perfect condition as it was being purchased used but I did not expect for the book to be filthy dirty and torn. It looked like it had been dropped several times on the floor and ran over by a fork truck or pallet truck. It will really makes me think twice before I purchase another used book. It might be worth paying the full price just so I can have a book that is readable. Everyone needs to think about ""Is the discounted price worth the trouble"". I would rate this purchase as very poor!"
4,A little book of truly meaningful quotations.,"This little book soars above the typical ho-hum pack of quotation books. Organized into chapters like Living Life To Its Fullest and Taking Risks, practically every quotation strikes me as pithy and profound and worthy of extended thought. The only drawback, in my opinion, is the author's self-generated quotations, which pale next to the wisdom of the ages.I'm buying several more copies to distribute to my family and friends this Christmas!"
5,Forever Gold,"""Forever Gold"" is a wonderfully varied collection of songs...some sung in English, some sung in Spanish, and some sung ina mixture of both languages...some sad, some romantic, somehappy, and some just for fun...all sung in the inimitable styleof Freddy Fender...with a rhythmic band for back-up. There aretwo songs that I don't really care for on this CD, but I totallyenjoy all the rest. Freddy Fender puts so much feeling into thewords. The mixture of songs provides both a beautiful and funlistening experience--one that I love hearing again and again."
3,Mirror,"As far as the mirrors go, they are sufficient. However, the suction base does not stay put on a flat surface. On a slant (window, vanity mirror) it does fine."
5,Gooseneck mirror-a great buy!,"Now I don't have to lean over the countertop see something close up. Like a rogue hair, or even putting on makeup. My vision is such that I can't see distance. When looking in a mirror-the distance is double what it would be. I love that I can use either side I need to. I highly recommend it! It is good that it has 3 suction cups in case 1releases unexpectedly."
5,For Zadro mirror,Now every woman in my family has a Zadro mirror! These mirrors are FABULOUS! Once you have used one you can't imagine doing anything else without it! You can see every pore and wrinkle on your face...kinda scary at first! It is a truly WONDERFUL product!
3,Not exactly what I need,"When I broke my 30-year old Clairol True To Light makeup mirror I bought this as a replacement. I thought I could get enough light from a table lamp, but I was wrong. Also, the 5X and 10X magnification was higher than I wanted for daily use, but it came in handy for tweezing. Switching back and forth between mirrors was awkward because I had to re-adjust the goose neck every time. Flipping a double-sided mirror around a central axis is much easier. Never tried the suction cup attachment in the bath room, and I think that is the mirror's best use."
2,missing pieces,"when i opened the box, it was missing the slide on suction mounting bracket, the main reason i bought the mirror.the mirror itself is ok, but probably won't be buying products here again."
1,"Pocos videos, muchas presentaciones","Compre este DVD super emocionada pensando que iba a poder ver todos los videos de mi tierna infancia por ejemplo ""timido"" ""me he enamorado de un fan"" ""bazar"", etc. pero resulta que este DVD solamente tiene DOS videos, todo lo demas son presentaciones (""siempre en domingo"", ""estrellas de los ochenta"", etc.) Los unicos videos que tiene son los de ""no controles"" y ""Ay amor!""Las entrevistas que tiene tambien son pocas, mas que nada de cuando ya estaban separandose y tambien de cuando volvieron a juntarse en el '99. Si eres un nostalgico(a) de los ochenta (como yo) y no puedes contenerte y tienes que comprar este DVD, mejor encargaselo a alguien en Mexico... Ahi lo puedes conseguir ""piraton"" y mucho mas barato! (je, je)"
5,Remember Myst with the music,"Remember Myst without going there. That's what this CD does. Each time you hear a track you remember the place you heard it in. The music from each age is on this CD, if you heard it in Myst you'll hear it on this CD. The music isn't exactly the same as it was in the game, its longer and is really the versions heard in realMYST. The only thing the doesn't make it the soundtrack to realMYST is that it doesn't have the music from the Rime age. If you liked to music from Myst and want to hear it agene without playing the game, buy this CD!"
5,The Music Says It All,"If you played the game you know that when you hear certain tracks it brings back visual memories of the worlds. The lost feeling moving through one of the worlds trying to get out or perhaps into a different one. Seeing a room filled with weapons or broken items.If you have not played the game but want music to open your mind and let the memories in your life flow try this.Haunting, memorable, inspirational sounds."
5,The Myst Soundtrack is good for everyone.,The Soundtrack displays many of the emotions and feelings that playing the game itself generates. It is good for even those who have not played the game. It is also a true testament to computer generated music and the quality at which it can perform. The mood is very dark and mysterious as well as knowing and remorseful.
3,"Great music, but they could have done more.","To start with, I have played and enjoyed Myst and Riven. I had not played Myst since 95' and listening to the CD I was surprised by what few memories I remembered from the game, maybe two or three tracks. I don't understand why this CD is only 41 minutes long. Why not fill up an entire 74 minutes by including the sound effects from the game (not the background music) or the dialogue from Sirrus, Achenar, or Artus? Especially when you consider that this music is not new, basically a rehashing of the game soundtrack I thought they could have put forth a better effort.Don't get me wrong I still like the Music, but based on the other reviews you would have thought this was the Beatles or something."
4,Apple continues to deliver,"With OS X 10.4.3 Tiger, Apple continues to provide significant improvements to its operating system. The upgrade went smoothly. I love the speed and the new features in their new search engine, Spotlight. I also like the new Dashboard, although there is a bit of fluff there.My main criticism continues to be Apple's minimalist approach to on-line help. It is not true that every feature of the OS is self-evident, and Apple doesn't seem to make much of an effort to enlighten."
5,It really is like a completely new computer,"The features and functionality are great, but what might also be of interest to lagging Mac upgraders are the speed enhancements. It made my clamshell graphite iBook much snappier, and even improved performance on our son's antique CRT iMac."
5,Mac OS X 10.4.3 Tiger Family Pack [DVD],"One Mac did not have a DVD reader, Apple exchanged the DVD for CD's,all work out great."
4,This was a good alternative to listen to at work.,"I've listened to this CD at work on my computer. Most of my co-workers don't kick and scream about this CD. They don't like my music for the most part, I think there just old!!"
4,way up and coming,brother cane rocks....i saw them and candlebox in wilmington DE at the big kahuna...brother cane blew candlebox away....that's alot to say for someone whose favorite band is candlebox...i've never see someone both sing lead and play lead guitar at the same time like this guy does...he is unbelievable...please come back to wilmington again....
2,Miss Fernande,"Don't buy it, it only contains 31 photos and they are not good quality due to the type of printing.It contains a screen play that is not interesting which takes up too much of the book.I have over 200 photos of her that are better quality which I obtained from the web."
4,The basic treatise on strict management,"We recommend this book to everyone who has employees: managers, supervisors or small business owners - especially if you are new to your position, are a first time manager or supervisor, have just hired your first employee or are about to do so. If the employees are running the ship at your company, it's time to take back control. Author Glenn Shepard tells you exactly how to do so in easy-to-implement logical steps. With this guide, even the most wishy-washy manager can become a model of strength, leadership and authority."
5,Ultimate & Practical Guide Every Manager Should Read!,"After managing for many years, I found just about every situation you can run into covered in Glenn's book. His advice is direct and very effective in dealing with problem employees. This is a book that every manager should keep in their library for quick reference and solutions to every day issues. If I had this book at the start of my career, it would have helped me tremendously. Thanks Glenn. This has become my management bible!"
5,wonderful!,Walter Matthau at his usual craggyness. Does anybody know if he really loves opera? He is always humming or singing from one in his movies. I never really noticed until I watched a marathon of his films and there it was-him singing (or attempting to). Delightful escape into the land of May-November/November-November romance with a great cast including Richard Benjamin and Art Carney for some comic relief.
4,Another chick flick -- but Matthau was funny and vulnerable,"Once again I chose a film because I am a fan of Matthau, so is my sweet husband (both of the Grumpy Old Men flicks) and while I laughed and had a good time he was ready to work in the shop, take a walk or watch a war or western! I still love him!!!"
2,Lonely Plantet - Estonia Latvia & Lithuania,"A major disappointment. I bought this book expecting useful information on travel between the three Baltic Republics but found virtually nothing of value. The book does devote a half page to Trans-Siberian train travel with mention of side trips to Lake Baykal and Mongolia. Figure that one out. Most of the ""Getting There and Away"" has to do with getting to the individual Republics from Europe and other parts of the world and even a lot of this is out dated. It seems that much of the book is cut and paste and lacks continuity between the various pieces. This book is need of a complete overhaul. Sorry to say, it's better than nothing, but not by a significant margin."
3,"Useful, but needs some work","As usual, Lonely Planet guides give the most detailed information on the ""nuts and bolts"" of travel (bus and train instructions, locations and practicalities.) We found this particularly useful in a region where we did not share a common language with the people.However, tourism to the Baltic region boomed in 2004 with these countries' entry into the EU, making the book's hotel listings completely inadequate. I don't fault the authors/editors for not anticipating the boom, but rather comment that, for example, with only 3000 hotel rooms in Vilnius a guidebook now needs to list a lot more hotles so visitors can hope to get one of those now-coveted rooms!The other drawback of this book is common to most other Lonely Planet titles: the information on cities, buildings, monuments, etc., is very dry (lacks color) and is overly terse. For such information, I have come to enjoy Rough Guides which usually include enjoyable walking tours of the major tourist areas."
5,Comprehensive and Concise,"The authors managed to stuff everything you need to know in a relatively small book. I have been in the Baltics three times and know Latvia quite well, but this book will enrich my next trip (the relatives and locals can only do so much).I recommed it."
2,Baltic States guide,"The maps in this guide were generic and not tied to the trip suggestions; there was virtually no information regarding rail transportation (or any other kind, for that matter)and no guide for obtaining the rail schedules. There was very little information regarding travel time from one place to another, even within the two-day or other schedules. There was very little information regarding what is available in-season and, more importantly to me, what is available out of season. There was absolutely nothing on monthly average weather conditions in any of the major cities of even country-wide for the three countries. Etc. Inshort, it is by far the worst of the Lonely Planet guides I have used."
5,Great cardigan,"This sweater was just what I wanted--simple but functional--for some cold Scandinavian days... It has kept its shape, no pilling, just great!"
3,Not as good as her other 2 books,I have loved the other two books by this author ever since I found them way back in high school. This one was an enjoyable read but won't be a favorite. Highland Masquerade is the one I like best. It is very reminiscent of early Mary Stewart books.
3,"Great TV, if it worked","The TV's main circuit board was defective from the start, causing a cracking noise after the TV had been on 30 minutes. Samsung did the repair and it is fine now. I wish it took them less than a week to come. I wish they didn't tell me that it must be my cable box that was defective and I had to swap that out before they would even make an appointment. Nevertheless, the repairman was very professional and fixed the problem on the spot."
3,It's a TV.,The TV is fine. Good Picture and Sound. Not cheap to fix. Lines are in TV after second year with repair cost over $1000.00. I'll live with lines in the TV.
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I SURE AM GRATEFUL I PURCHASED THE 3 YEAR SERVICE CONTRACT!I have had this TV since December of 2006 and now have a second service call scheduled. The screen has developed black lines horizontally across the screen and has a watery quality to it. It is really evident in faces and sky pictures. It is not displaying in HD.This is the same problem I had in November of 2006.There is no reason for something so expensive to be of such poor quality. If this repair doesn't take hold, I will be looking for restitution."
5,"Great TV, Great Buy!",Samsung is king of DLP televisions and Amazon is king of price. Highly recommend this set.....
4,"Upgrade to the 46"" if possible","Having seen this TV in stores, I was very impressed. After doing further research, though, I found that the 46"" model had slightly better black levels and did not suffer from a problem some refer to as ""black grass."" Black grass describes a (slight) certain shadow or impression that you see at the top and/or bottom of the screen that may be distracting for some. So, if you have the space, the small price increase (around $40, if I am not mistaken) is certainly worth it for those small details and a larger image.Aside from that, the TV is brilliant and produced a picture as good as most any LCD or plasma I have seen (albeit from a more restricted viewing angle). I just submitted a very detailed review of the 46"" model, whose details, except for those mentioned above, are just about the exact same as this one's, and the bottom line is that it is a great choice."
2,Good TV... at first...,"I purchased this particular TV in March of 2007. It had a great picture - especially with HD channels. I have noticed a small white spot on the display. I did a little looking around on the internet to see if anyone else had this problem. I found numerous people who have the same issue with their Samsung. Several people have posted videos of their TVs - with hundreds of white spots. Some of the people have claimed that the cause can be anything from dust to a faulty motherboard to the mirrors locking up. Apparently Samsung is aware of this problem, but has yet to issue a recall or offer to fix any of the TVs that are ""infected."""
1,Poor Service after Sale,"I bought this TV shortly before Christmas 2006 and it failed 2 months later. It's been 6 weeks and we cannot get a straight answer from Samsung. They no longer make this TV, so they can't give us a new or refurbished one. They say the will give us a refund, but in several more weeks. No one on the phone ever knows anything and has no authority to speed up the process. We've been lied to, we've been told someone will CALL US, but no one ever does, we've been given the run around over and over again. It will probably be 3 months before anything happens (from the time we first called them). I don't know if I just got a bad unit or what, but regardless, their service is lousy and I suspect this design is a bad one that gives them lots of problems. I would not buy this model again."
4,"Great HDTV, not so great picture for non-HD programs","I am really happy with the picture quality (and everything else) for HD programs and DVD (I am using HDMI player & connection), however I am a bit disappointed with the picture for non-HD programs. This is my first HDTV, so I can't really compare it to any other HDTV, but on some programs the picture is just awful."
5,My favorite TV,"All my TV's have been CRT before this. And this one is a lot nicer. I've been watching DVD's and playing Gears of War (XBox 360) on it for the past week. It looks great and was easy to set up--I'm not an A/V expert, but I can plug green-into-green and blue-into-blue. I haven't noticed any noise from the fan or color-wheel. So far it's just great all around. And light enough for one person to move."
5,Great for sports theme,"My sons bedroom theme is sports. These sports balls were a great idea to accent his bed. They are plush, and have kind of a fleece feel to them. They look much better than the ones that are in Target and Walmart. My son loves to throw them all over his room. They are not the same size as a pro ball, a bit smaller, but perfect for decoration. They even have a more realistic shape to them, and they come in a mesh carring bag that comes in handy when transporting other small toys on the go."
2,There is a design defect that causes the brush to stop moving,"In general we have been very happy with Bruder products, however this attachment has a design flaw that requires me to repair the toy time and time again. There are 2 rubber o-rings that wrap around the main wheels that often come off of the wheels and this causes the brush (which is driven by the pressure from the o-rings to the brush wheels) to stop spinning, much to the dismay of 4-year old son. I have tried gluing the o-rings in place and hopefully that will solve the problem."
3,Moderate film,"The scenery is beautiful and the video quality is superb. The price is also affordable to many.But the narration is not attractive and seems like listening to a lecture by the school geographical teacher, which somewhat makes it not so entertaining. The camera shot is ok but far inferior to that made by BBC."
2,Sound advice :-),"I'd have to agree with the others here who posted comments on this disc. Video is pretty good quality, but the sound is YUCK!!! Whoever was responsible for editing this, and finalizing it needs to go back to school. If the Narrator on this disc was at sound volume level of lets say 10 ( just picking a number for comparisons sake), then the people talking in this disc are at sound level 5. What I'm trying to say is when listening to this disc the narration is about 50% louder than when a person in this disc is telling you something about Yellowstone. IMHO that is totally amaturish when producing a professional blu-ray, and or dvd disc. Unacceptable!"
1,Thoroughly Unreliable...,"Run far, far away from this USB Hub! It constantly resets itself, so anything plugged into it with be working fine, then go offline, follwed by getting 'recognized' again (sometimes including a driver reinstall of the device). When I mean constantly, I mean at random intervals, but around 10 times in a given hour it will do this.At first I thought it was the hub itslef, so I exchanged it, but the 2nd hub did exactly the same thing. Stay away. You've been warned."
2,Beautiful but unreliable,"I have five USB hubs, and this is by far the least reliable. Especially when bringing my PC out of standby mode, this hub powers itself down and/or loses its connection to one or more devices. It's a shame, because I really appreciate the number and layout of the ports. Larger USB devices (such as some flash drives) don't bump into each other."
5,Outstanding game. Outstanding music!,"It doesn't really matter if you've played the game or not, this CD is a must. I played Riven and was amazed that the music topped that of Myst's. If you played Riven it would be stupid not to buy this CD. Excellent!!"
4,Dreamlike journey through Riven,"Its an amazing ""soundtrack"", no doubt. Im not sure the music alone diserves 5 star rating. I am a fan of Myst, and listened through the tracks multiple times. I know there are only a handful that really captured me. Some songs can get a little too ambient.The Riven music definatly brought its world life, though. Sometimes, I feel you really had to be one to journey though the game itself, to really enjoy it. Thats where the full experience of the music came into play.The music style itself is really a combination of tribal, classical, new age, and ambient.The instruments: (This might not be accurate, but just to give an idea)Metal Drums, bongos, chimes, bells, piano and electric, air instrument, and string instruments?The music is very ambient most of the time. But if you are in the mood for background music, its great atmosphere.Some of my most favorite tracks are:Atrus' ThemeBonus TrackCatherine's FreedomFissureGehn's ThemeMoeity ThemeTempleWahrk Room"
5,Must Have For Musicians,"For any unsigned band or musician that wants to jump start their career, this book provides all the resources. When properly mined and used as a tool, many great things can happen. I can attest to this through experiences I have had using this publication. Wanna find a label? Look here! Wanna find a manager? Look here."
4,Lovely Ideas,"This book has 12 projects that they show how to make. Step by step on most projects, and these projects are actually ""do-able"" from a beginner standpoint."
5,Nice layout and well written How-to,This is a very pretty and well laid out book that takes you through several types of mosaic projects. Nice how-to with very clear pictures.
4,Mesmerizing If Not Commercial,"Suki Rae's Water and Fire is an intriguing blend of instrumental improvisations with a Middle Eastern Flavor. Suki's flute takes center stage as it weaves some interesting passages. Some compelling guitar and piano passages do captivate my attention as well.This Suki Rae recording does vary in format from her two recent releases My Bamboo Hat and I Think Of You. The focus is more on jamming and less on melodies. Thise audiences who like focused songs may not appreciate this recordings fine instrumental passages. And the first piece does wander a bit too long without enough interesting moments. Some of the percussion beats get a little wearisome as well.However, there is plenty of talent here to make this a good listen to certain open minded audiences. 3 1/2 stars seems about right."
5,til my casket drops,"STR8 FIRE-FEAT.SPICE-1,MARVALESS,BIG SYKE,JT THE BIGGA FIGGA,LUNASICC,PIZZO,E-40,MAC MALL & KILLA TAY...this an essential album from tha baldhead nut-get gas chamber through best appearances 91-99"
4,C-Bo returns with a vengance!,"After dropping the weak ""One Life 2 Live"", C-Bo returns to his glory days with ""Til My Casket Drops"". Apparentley, the court's threat to send C-Bo back to prison if he recorded another 'gangsta' album didn't faze him. Just check the song Deadly Game (possibily the best song he's ever recorded), where Bo lyrically bucks down up the judge in his case, as well as his parole officer. Lyrics like ""...when a copper pulls you over, shoot him in the face ya'll..."" are abundant throughout this journey into the ruthless mind of Bo-Loc. The only downside to this album is all the guest appearances by less skilled MC's. The only guests who lyrically hold their own with Bo is E-40 and Big Syke. The other MC's just seem to clutter up the songs. All in all, this one of the greatest reality rap albums of all time. It has it all, the raw, adrenaline pumping beats, and the razor sharp, provacative lyrics to match. You can't go wrong with this album."
5,Absolute Classic,"This is easily in my top ten Gangsta Rap Albums of all time...Consider the circumstances, C-Bo is released from prison with the stipulation that he ""can't rap about the police or gang lifestyle"" in future albums....& He Releases ""Til My Casket Drops"",oh boy...the song 'Deadly Game' was co-wrote with X-Raided while they shared a cell & wastes no time attacking specific Officers & California Govenor Pete Wilson...The entire album is solid & features a number of guest appearances from Bay Area Artists... If you listen to that Soft Poppy Ish, this isn't the album for you!"
4,shoot em in the face yall,this a tight album from bo loc right here. im feelin the guest artists on here like killa tay jt the mob figaz spice 1. im feelin 357 the mellow beat got me smokin a zone . point being hop on the album cuz its tight
5,A book any scholar knows and any interested one should know,"Sir Alan's work is ""the book"" for any interestedperson. It's a milestone not only in the study of Egyptian language,but in modern philology. Maybe the style is old looking, but good language is understandable, no matter when it was written. Its ""antiquate style"", makes it even more interesting to be read. To me, it was easy to read even when, as a hi school student, I've seen a copy in Venice's State library. Thanks to Gardiner's book I've started my egyptological studies. It was in 1974 and I was 16 years old. It's an expensive book, but each page is worth its price. A necessary complement to the Grammar is ""Egypt of the Pharaohs - an introduction"", where Sir Alan guides us through ancient egyptian history, always under some linguistical and philological point of view. I don't exaggerate if I say that who owns this book owns a little bibliographical and cultural monument."
4,interesting and informative,"Not your average holiday book. Initially printed in 1929,the book starts with an introduction to the ancient Egyptian language in the form of heiroglyphics. The lessons begin very simply and each subsequent one becomes more difficult,although there is plenty of assistance with vocabulary and a dictionary at the end of the book to help. It requires plenty of time to work through and a lot of effort on the reader's part but it is well worth the trials and tribulations. One definately learns a lot through this excellent tome"
5,A Serious book for Serious Students,"Alan Gardiner's Egyptian Grammar is THE book for the serious student of Egyptian hieroglyphs. Definately not for the non serious layperson, Gardiner goes into indepth detail on the decipherment and transliteration of Middle Egyptian hieroglyphs. An expensive book, but well worth it."
2,Almost impenetrable,"Gardiner's book was a true ground-breaker in this field. It is now badly in need of revision and updates, and its antiquated style makes it extremely hard to follow, with or without a teacher. It's high time some brave soul wrote a new Egyptian grammar that was up to date, clear, easy to read, and based on more modern pedagogical theories."
2,A good sleep aid,"It took me a long time to read this book, as I kept falling asleep after a few pages. Despite the dramatic historical events, the narrative itself is quite flat. The author tries to counteract this with a liberal sprinkling of sexual exploits...many of them homosexual. This recurring theme became as tedious as the rest of the narrative. I found myself losing track of characters and having to constantly search for earlier references to try to figure out who they were. Perhaps the rather pedantic writing of the narrator was a deliberate literary device. The book has a lot of archaic-sounding phrases and reads like it was translated from another language...all of which was probably intentional. Deficiencies of style, plot construction, and focus have been noted by other reviewers. For some people, the political merit seems to outweigh the literary failings, but this wasn't the case for me."
5,Just Smooth,"I can just tell you as a smooth jazz lover this cd is a goodie.It takes me back to the 90's smooth jazz, hard bass line's but just cool.He has Art Porter down."
3,Qualified praise,"I love the size of this towel and how absorbent it is. However, I had ordered the exact same kind of towel in a different color and after just two trips to the washing machine the whole side of the towel started fraying really badly! So I'm worried that that might happen with these other towels as well."
3,Where;s the set ?,"You have a picture of a set of towells, but all your selling isa large towel. I really like the towels. I wish I had a set.I should of read the small print.Great product , Just misleading.Thanks Dennis"
2,HARD TO USE,THIS SET FUNCTIONS HOWEVER THE WRENCHES ARE HARD TO USE SINCE THE HANDLE KEEPS FOLDING AND DOESN'T PROVIDE GOOD GRIP. I WAS ABLE TO GET THE JOB DONE BUT WOULD NOT RECOMEND.
4,Single sided 1:125k waterproof topo map,"A beautiful, color topo map of Sequoia/Kings Canyon. Not detailed enough if you are backpacking, this is more of a tool to plan an extended trip. The ""Kings Canyon High Country"" and ""Mt. Whitney High Country"" maps (1:63k) directly from Tomharrisonmaps.com are probably most useful for the general backpacker. National Geographic has a 2-sided version of this thing at a slightly more detailed scale."
5,I love this sink!,"My family and I just completed a complete kitchen renovation and I got some great new things, but I have to say that this sink may be my favorite (as well as my husband and son's). It's deep, but not too deep. It's very roomy and stylish. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a larger stainless steel sink. I can fit large pans in it, multiple plates, glasses, etc. I can even polish large silver items in it.Great sink."

3,Cool tool,"Being a lean mean green machine I am a huge fan of this spork! Nice tool to use when I am on campus for class and again I love that its not plastic!I love the color on this spork, but it changes whenever I touch it to an odd yellowish color, it goes away once washed but even washing it leaves a funny yellow water mark on the spork. Not a fan of the discoloration, its not permanent but it takes away from the cute purple."
4,Be Touched By Gold... Again,"Andi Hamilton offered her horse training services at a charity auction. When a mysterious sheikh won them she was curious. When she discovered who the sheikh was, she was alarmed. They had shared a moment of grief and a night of passion years before. Why has Sam come back into Andi's life so many years later? Will Andi let him back in? And will she tell him that their passion resulted in a son? Ms. Gold writes with her usual passion, charm and touch of gold and has given her readers another story of true love and happily ever after."
3,mediocre victory,"Although Ian Brown does have one of the most unique, enduring, and pleasant voices, the new material leaves room for much improvement. Realizing that most of the material was formulated from his recent bout with a prison sentence, it does provide a more intimate window into Ian's life. Perhaps I yearn for a more traditional Rose sound. Not being much of a techno fan, I was a bit disappointed with the persistence to have the mechanical beats be the foundation of most of the tunes. However, I think that the album is worth listening to, if anything, for his alluring voice and personal lyrics."
4,It's Gettin' Better Man...,The Roses were THE band. Ian Brown is STILL the man (or monkey). This is a definite improvement over his last album. Hopefully the next will be even better. Sooner or later people will realize the Roses are no more and take this album for what it is....GOOD! Long live King Monkey!
3,"Not as much fun as ""Monkey""","Takes a while to get to like; ""Set My Baby Free"" is a top song though. The beats tend to be the same, however it is more polished than ""Unfinished.."".Just not as much fun."
4,Like techno? Liked the Roses? Just love stoner music?,Buy this album - I've introduced this to a lot of my friends from all walks and it's met with universal love.
1,"Hardback great, Kindle useless","I have the hardback version and it's great. I'd give it 5 stars. Unfortunately my son just bought the Kindle edition and it is completely unusable as a reference book or as a Bible translation. It looks like the publisher just OCR'ed the book (where the verse numbers are offset in the margin) and then laid out the text with the verse numbers embedded wherever they happened to fall. As a result the verse numbers are misleading, but in any case they are impossible to use for navigation because nothing in this book is hyperlinked.All in all the Kindle version is a waste of money. Which is a great pity, because the content is worth having."
1,Loved the authors words but book very poorly made,"W.W.Norton did a VERY POOR job in the manufacturing of this book. The binding on my book let go of it's pages with only a few weeks use. As much as I love Robert Alter's translations and love reading this book, I would not purchase it again. It just fell apart. I'm reading from a stack of over 200 loose pages that fell out of the middle of the book with the first 200 hanging by an inch of glue and ready to let go at any moment. I wanted to purchase the other Alter books, but am hesitant. I'll see who published them prior to deciding to purchase.Purchased 2008, I apologize for the lateness of this review but I've been fighting cancer and too ill to be at computer."
3,Less Than Navigable,"I should not have hesitated to give this book five stars, had W.W. Norton but taken the trouble to link the footnotes to the text. It is more than a little annoying to have to scroll backward an forward ten to twenty screens to keep the notes and the relevant text straight in my head. Amazon could solve that problem by making that a must for all annotated publications in Kindle format."
2,Gross Omissions,"This is not a comment on the substance of Dr Alter's translation. I opened it today for comparative study; I own three other versions of The Five Books. To my dismay, I find no Parashat-Named Headings,none; merely Chapter Headings,and Bk Chapt.#s at the top of each page. I sought refuge in the index. There is no index! I have read many reviews and comments of this work and none, not one, mentioned this glaring omission. For a layman as myself I find this book too tedius to bother with,other than when I go to another version for the missing information. It is beyond my comprehension how this highly praised book by a masterful author could be published without the norms I have mentioned."
3,misrepresentation,"Author promiseed an exact and authentic translation of the Hebrew. Although I am by no means an expert I find the translation very ""loose"" and in some cases worse than the usuall and traditional one's. The insights and commentaries are seldom better than what can be found in other Torah commentaries."
5,Very Helpful Commentary,"I've been using this text as part of a Bible Study I conduct. The commentary is primarily a translator's. What I mean by that is that it's not mainly a theological commentary, but one which seeks to understand the Hebrew text and explain how the translator sees the text. I like that insofar as what I'm looking for is an attempt at an accurate translation rather than as someone promoting his own theological agenda. If you're looking for theological interpretations, then this commentary would be of limited interest. The primary goal is to render an accurate literary translation of the Hebrew and to offer some archeological/ancient cultural commentary. I can see this text useful regardless of whether it's used by Jews or Christians."
1,Do Not Buy!,"I bought this PSP Privacy filter since I play games on the train and watch anime/movies and don't like it when people stares at it. So, I decided to buy this but to my surp this filter is really bad. Poor quality, it may somewhat give you a little privacy from people next to you but they can still see it. The main issue with this privacy filter is that it really messes up the screen brightness and quality. I do not know how to describe but its like very tiny nets all over the screen. if you don't believe me buy it and find out yourself.Edit: The filter is larger than PSP-Slim screen! That means you will have bubbles at one end!"
2,"too many problems, not very effective","This harness is extremely difficult to put on, especially when your four-legged buddy is anticipating a walk, loosens itself a lot while walking making you re-adjust it constantly, and simply wasn't effective after about the third walk. We found a far more effective harness:Premier Easy Walk Dog Harness, Red, Large"
2,Not for large strong dogs!,"I just tried this again today on my 55 lb. dog and it just doesn't work. The harness wiggles loose and I have to continually tighten it and readjust the snap. Fortunately she's a good dog and will stop and let me adjust it, but within two minutes, it's worked loose again and I have to again tighten it. She's a lab-boxer mix, so she has a strong chest and she just ignores the pulling under her front legs. When she saw a squirrel at the end of the walk, she maneuvered her head out of the harness, and it was only my voice command that kept her from running after it. For a strong dog, it's totally ineffective."
3,How do you put it on?,"Im not sure exactly how this thing is supposed to rest on the dog's back. The instructions on the box are lousy, including the figures. The image of the dog on the box is a frontal view so you can't see how it rests on the back. When I put it on my dog I tighten the buckle down so that it rests on the middle of the dog's back. But when I brought my dog for obedience training to Petco, the trainer told me I had it on wrong. She said that I need to slip the buckle under the loop on the back of the dog's neck and then pull back. But even she wasn't sure! It seems to keep the dog from pulling either way but I wish I could be sure of the correct way."
1,Does not work for our dogs.,I returned this item. It did not change the way my dogs walked and they were as out of control as ever.
5,Best anti pull device ever!,"This is a great product. A very passive way for your dog to learn not to pull on the leash. A small piece of flat plastic is against their breastbone, so if the dog pulls, it is uncomfortable and they quickly stop. One use and my dogs stopped straining against the leash."
4,Works as advertised,The P20 Zoom Flash works as advertised. I use my camera almost exclusively for real-estate interior shots and this flash's bounce and manual-adjustment capabilities do the job.
5,Incredible,"There is nothing more interesting or informative in the psychic world than studying the work of Edgar Cayce, and this book is a top notch study. Well written, and easy to understand."
5,Great Book,"One of the older books on this subject written by a geat Man, have read all his books very interesting, hope you enjoy it like I did,"
4,My Son Likes It,"i bought this only because my two year old son kept coming home from daycare saying ""poky pocus"". Finally figured out it was this movie because they watched it there. He really likes it and it keeps him quite!"
5,Review of the movie I ordered,I'm very pleased with the response time it took to send me the CD. It was in perfect condition. Thank you Amazon.
3,it would not play in my laptop,"I bought this DVD for my daughter. When we first opened it the cover on the dvd looked odd, like it was burned or something. Then it would not play in my laptop. This is the only dvd that would not play in my laptop and I have over 350 dvd's. But it played fine in the dvd player, so I guess all is fine."
4,Hocus Pocus DVD,"This DVD is a Halloween classic. A childhood favorite and over all family friendly movie, I recommend it to anyone who enjoy cute family type films."
4,Hocus Pocus lots of Halloween fun!!,This is a fun movie to watch around halloween. Filled with lots of bewitiching fun.
4,Still a classic,My wife and son love this movie and it has continued to grow on me as well. It is an entertaining holiday movie following the story of a kid who moves to a new town and accidentally brings back 3 witches. The witches will stop at nothing to get the essence of a child prior to sunrise or they will turn to stone forever. Funny scene is seeing the mom dressed up as old school Madonna.
3,Kids seem to love it,"My son and neice just love this movie, they watch it over and over. I give it a 3 because they love it but it just puts me to sleep with boredom trying to watch it."
1,Hocus Pocus,Very poorly done. Intelligence level was insulting. Too much hype for poor quality movie. Not at all what we expected.
2,Is it Really that magical?-Hocus pocus,I thought that this movie was a waste of time and i did not like it that much the only thing that makes it good is the hot & sexy Vinessa Shaw and Sarah Jessica parker they will make your heart race!
1,Awful.,"Awful movie, terrible acting, especially by SJP. Thoroughly ridiculous, uneven, poorly directed, poorly edited, and very very poorly written, the worst movie about witches ever. It's not even a little bit funny.No Stars."
1,Are we watching the same movie??????????,"Okay I have to admit this film has a interesting plot (witches return to Salam after 300 years), and some great special effects but the major cast 'sucked' the wind out of the film and that was why it failed at the theater. The ""Divine Miss M"" was attempting to switch from her Gay following to her Disney following which left both group's lost. SJP had not yet developed her S&TC; following so she she thumped about 'smelling children'. And the last member (KN) which I guess was the ""funny one"" of the troop always got left out: i.e. having to ride a vacuum instead of a broom - ha, ha the first time. I felt like I was watching a remake of the 3 stooges. If I wanted to watch the 3S I would buy 3S and not some disney remake.I felt sorry for the kids and some of the adults - both were really cute but were just overshadowed by the 'big stars'."
1,One of the Worst Films Ever Made!,"This movie is terrible. There's really no other way to say it. I tried to watch it with my children, and trust me, I'm a Halloween hound. I love all things Halloween, but this movie was a big, fat stinker. Absolutely terrible, awful special effects (if you want to call them that), bad plot, less than mediocre acting. Just bad, bad, bad!"
5,Loved it 2 Much,"To sum up how much I love this movie I taped it off tv, then I bought it on VHS and now I have ordered the DVD. I watch this movie several times a year, not just at Halloween. I only hope that they someday release the soundtrack for this one. I would definately buy that too."
4,The 2nd Best(real)Disney film yet!!!!,I absolutely luv this movie.It wuz the best disney film yet(n my mind) until FREAKY FRIDAY wuz released!I so recommend this movie 2 n-e-1 who has an imagination!Well thats my review.
5,Love it!,Great! Have always loved this movie! My friends and I dressed up as the Sanderson sisters for Halloween and have won a few contests :)
5,Great movie for kids,Witches hallowen and all kids of fun. GotHere on time well pack. Ment for kids but funFor everyone.
5,great movie!,"Great movie, good quality, arrived quickly and as expected. I love watching this fun movie each year. A must-have to watch every Halloween!"
5,Totally Hilarious!!,"Bette Midler is a total hoot in this movie. Young children might find this movie a bit scary, but pre-teens, teens and adults should all find it very funny."
5,Great Halloween time movie,This movie is an all-time Halloween favorite movie in our house. Finally realized I didn't have a copy of it in the house.Item was delivered on time and in good condition.Very satisfied.
4,Funny,"My mother is from Salem, MA and wanted to watch this movie with my kids - ages 8 & 10 and they loved it and talked about it for weeks after they saw it."
4,Hocus Pocus.,The movie was good and exactly as I remember it. The only problem that I ran into was that it stopped a couple of times and had to restart.
5,Holy...Pocus!,"I always get a big laugh out of this movie.My grand kids and I watch it a lot.That's why I replaced my well used VHS copy, with this DVD.It arrived as schedualed in perfect condition.Perfect Service - Perfect ProductThank You"
5,Great Halloween Movie!,I love this movie at Halloween. The only problem is the rest of the year it says on the self. I had this in DVD and was looking forward to it in bluray. Great family movie!
4,oldie but a goodie,this is an old halloween fav with bette midler and good triumps and and is put to right personally id say 8 y/o youngest and that depends on what exposure you want for this kind of movie
4,classic,"there really aren't any other words but classic, like really. Anyone who watches this movie will have a good time. :)"
2,Great Halloween Movie,"Great movie to share and watch during the season. However, this blu-ray version wasn't any better than the previously released DVD version. In fact, some scenes were so ""noisy"" that I found it distracting! Other than that, the movie Hocus Pocus is a good family flick which will last for generations."
2,"Wonderful movie, but missed opportunity by Disney","First let me say that the 2 star rating is for the Blu-ray combo pack, not the film. As Disney well knows now that this film has become a cult classic as well as one of the most watched Halloween flicks on tv every year. Yet once again we get a bare bones release. And a extra copy of the DVD released back in the early 2000's. The transfer of the movie to blu-ray looks nice, clean and a little more colorful. But barely. I was really hoping for deleted scenes(which there are plenty), behind the scenes and maybe some interviews. But Disney completely dropped the ball. Maybe someday they'll get a clue.Also a heads up to people purchasing ""The Muppet Christmas Carol""blu-ray as it will not feature the full cut of the film that a previous DVD had. What is going on Disney!?!"
2,"Great movie but not a true ""WIDESCREEN"" format as stated.","This is a great movie but it is not in 1:85 widescreen format. It is in a 4:3 aspect. I called Disney and they tried to explain that it is their only release of the movie. They admitted it wasn't in a true 1:85 widescreen and will not fill a 16x9 hi-def T.V. (looks great on a 4:3 T.V.) After playing mind checkers with the Disney operator for a few minutes, they could'nt give a reason why it is advertised as a widescree movie."
1,Dont waste your money,This movie was so bad having now seen it I wouldn't take it if they were giving it away for free. I guess it would make a child friendly Hallooween movie. It wont scare them but it will bore them.
1,Disney wrost movie.,"This movie shoud be on MST3000.""This are my three ugly sisters.""""She flying a what?""""You she her this moring."""
5,Great movie,"This is one of the classic movies from my childhood, and I just had to own a copy. This arrived quickly and I love to watch it every year. I love the actors, and it never gets old!"
5,This movie put a spell on me... and now it's mine!,"Over the years, there have been cheesey and stupid Halloween films. There have been stupid and cheesey Disney films. ""Hocus Pocus"" does not belong in either of those categories. It is a funny, slightly scary and above all, entertaining film for most of the family. Disney definetely pushed the envelope here (how many jokes were there about a virgin lighting the candle?). I remember being seven or eight and wanting to watch this move, but I wasn't allowed to because it was too scary. Now it is easily my faviorite Holloween flick and is definitely on my A list of movies. Bette Midler does a great job at being funny and truly frightening at the same time. The other two were funny but not scary. She is my favorite character, and her rendition of ""I put a spell on you"" is easily one of the film's highlights. What the heck were the critics thinking?"
4,Not good for Witches but it is good for laughs.,"If you want a true representation of Witches then don't watch this movie! However, if camp, fun and laughs is what you're after then give it a go. It's just scary enough for the entire family, so you won't have to put the children to bed first. In fact, children will identify with the heroes. Please do, however, explain the truth about Witches to them before you watch it so that they'll understand this is FICTION.Even though it's so bad for the Craft, I still love it. A guilty pleasure perhaps?"
3,Hocus Pocus,"It's an OK movie, nothing great, but good enough to entertain the grandkids. It wasn't priced too high, although for an older movie, it was a little more than should be."
5,Always Loved This Movie!,"This movie is fun for everyone of all ages. I watched it first in my early teens on the Disney channel; came back to watch it again this year as my partner had never seen it! I always crack up, everyone should watch."
5,Hocus Pocus,I seen it when it first came out at the theater and I thought it was great. So I was shopping for halloween movies and came across this and had to have it.
5,Excellent Comedy,"This movie is what got me hooked to Bette Midler as I got a chance to see it when I was a pre, preteen in the mid 90s. Bette Midler fascinated me with the redhaired and the comedic, weird performance. In fact this also hooked kind of to the other performers-Sarah Jessica Parker, Kathy Najimy and Thora Birch. Many people dub this movie as a bomb when it really isn't as it made $40 million at the box office when it came out and a respectable return from rentals. The actors do a great job as the children awaken withces three hundred years later who were hung and killed by the village people. The witches must suck the lives from one of the children before the sun rises so that they can live forever. THe withces steal the show with a song that they sing and this walk in which they say HUNHH, HUNHH as well as how well they play off one another as almost THREE STOOGES female counterparts. Great for the kids and the family in general!!"
5,adorable kids' movie,"My granddaughters (age 8 and 6) asked for the movie, and have watched it several times, as have I. The acting and production values are top-notch, the story is cute not scary."
5,got it today,this is my favorite movie so funny about sanderson sisters from 1692 hanged by witch hunters and awaken in future must see movie to get a few laughs and good popcorn and watch it on halloween night good for the whole family and kids too no violence are in these movies these are better than horror movies not recommended for many of us.
3,HA HA HA HA!,"Hmmm, after you have then this movie quite alot of times it starts to get ridiculous but still very funny and good. When Max lights the Sanderson Sisters virgin candle, he actually brings the 3 old hags back to life from 300 years ago. Think its a good thing? No way! Cos the Sanderson Sisters are tricking all the kids in town to thinking that they are all good, peaceful witches! Wrong, again! All they wanna do to these children is....see it to find out!"
3,Funny But,"The movie overall was enjoyable but not too good for kids. One must question in a day of STD's, teen pregnancy, and broken teen hearts why Disney thought it appropriate to villify virginity at least three times."
3,Like the movie but learn the real history,"This movie is cute, endearing, and funny. I just wish it didn' t overshadow or throw dirt on the innocent people, mostly women and an erderly man who were subjected to cruelty, torture , and one of the worst injustices in history on the say so and connivings of a few brats with the agenda of getting themselves out of trouble with their puritan elders. All I can ask is if you watch this, then also sober yourself by watching The Crucible with Daniel Ray Lewis."
3,Fun! But not for the whole family,"This movie was a great little halloween movie to sit down and watch with the kids, but contrary to alot of the reviews here it's NOT for smaller children. There is swearing in the movie (d word, h word, and several unnecessary references to virginity and 'Yabos' referring to breasts) and there are several creepy spots with a zombie that smaller kids won't care for at all.Personally I think if your child is 14 and up they'll get a kick out of it. If they're 17 they'll just laugh at you.If they're younger, save your money."
4,Witches are the good thang.,"I do love a good witchy woming. And would you know that there are one more than two of them in this flick that makes licking a tail of a paticula rat fun..F-U-N it is to the max I say. The problem with this kind of a sexy film is that while it is a good kind of effort, you speck me to believe it? No, I don't believe for one diggity dang second. Ain't no such thang as a witch or two otha witches. But boy, if they was, I would be flyin so so very high."
3,Hocus Pocus Review,I enjoyed this movie because it had a nice variety of humor to the Halloween movie. Disney did a GREAT job with this one. I just wish it would come out on DVD.
5,Good family movie,"The Sanderson sisters are witches that vowed to come back in the future to steal the the souls of children in order to make them young again. That may sound too scary for children, but this movie blends lots of laughs with that theme. The witches are played by Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy. These women have wonderful comedic timing and make the perfect trio for blundering evil afoot. Both parents and kids will enjoy this one."
4,it's for Halloween!,"It's pretty good, the kids liked it. it seems like a good family movie for everybody in the household on Halloween."
4,Great movie,This is a Halloween favorite every year and worth the move to bluray. Fantastic kids movie. It will put a spell on you.
5,fun halloween movie,Hocus Pocus is a fun Halloween movie for all ages. A star studded film with an entertaining story line and song performances
5,Halloween Treat For All,"Hocus Pocus was one of my favorite movies that brought One of my favorite special days into my mind more than any movie other than Believe, another great Halloween pict. It took years to finally get the DVD after having the VHS. It's just as great as ever for fun, laughs and thrills. And who can ever forget CCR's ""I Put A SPEll ON You"" after seeing this movie. Just GreaTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!"
5,Always a goody,I have seen this movie a number of times and always enjoy it. I suppose that says it all really. If you can watch a movie more than once it has to be good. So much so I ordered it through Amazon when I could not locate it here at home.
3,"A Broom, A Mop, and A Vaccuum?","This is not one of Bette's more famous movies, and though it has a slow start, it turns out to be quite a fun show. Imagine 3 sisters from the era of the Salem witch trials in today's world.. They wouldn't stand out too much. But Bette seems to carry this show with her own style of comedy. One of the funniest moments has to be when the 3 have to find brooms to ride; and of course the nuttiest sister has to ad-lib when she can't find one. Though it starts slow, and at times the plot seems to get a bit too complicated, it still has moments of hilarity that only come from a Bette Midler style comedy. Fun for all ages, though some explanations might be needed as the plot lays out."
4,Hocus Pocus night'!,"You're in for a devil of a time when three outlandishly wild witches --Bette Midler,Sarah Jesica Parker and Kathy Najimy --return from 17th century Salem after they are accidentally conjured up by some unsuspecting pranksters! It's a night full of zany fun and comic chaos once the tricky 300-year-old trio sets out to cast a spell on the town and reclaim their youth--but first they must get their act together and outwit three kids and a talking cat! Loaded with bewitching laughs, HOCUS POCUS is an outrageously wild comedy that's sure to entertain everyone!"
5,Wonderful!!!,My family all loves this movie. We were sad when our VCR died and we couldn't watch it as planned. Amazon to the rescue-we watched it via our Roku through Amazon.com's instant video. Thanks AMAZON!!!
4,Let's be honest...,"Hocus Pocus is not the best film ever made, by far. The teen actors (except for Vinessa Shaw as Allison) give overblown performances. The contemporary part is nearly embarrassing. BUT, when the Sanderson Sisters are reawakened, this film turns into a guilty pleasure. Bette Midler, especially, but Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker as well, play the sisters to the hilt, and it's fun to ride along and see how they cope with modern life. Don't miss the cameos by Gary Marshall and Penny Marchall. Not perfect, but fun for Halloween!"
5,AMAZING,"My favorite Halloween movie of ALL time! Such a great film for anyone of any age. This corny, yet seriously comedic film will have you biting your nails and dying of laughter the entire time.A must see for every family."
5,A thoughtful pedagogy,"Ancient Greek Alive, through its early focus on oral skills, offers students an entrance into the language that is natural and enduring. The act of speaking Greek cements many grammatical concepts in the minds of the students before they learn them formally. The presentation is charming, engaging the students in a way that allows them to work through the grammar thoroughly without the sense of mind-numbing drudgery that seems to attend so many introductory language courses. Concepts are introduced at the right time, and in the right way. The book is a powerful learning tool; any student who works through it will be prepared to aquire the deep understanding of Greek that comes only from reading its authors."
2,Not for self-study!,"I made a terrible mistake- I read all the reviews of Amazon.com readers here pertaining to this book and bought it for self-study of ancient Greek as a result. As soon as I opened it, I discovered it was useless -- it is written for the Greek teacher and the student in class who is having the essentials explained by the teacher. There are so many assumptions made in the first chapters alone that an independent learner who does not have a Greek teacher has to give up immediately, and seek another method of learning Greek instead. Advice - don't buy this book if learning on your own. However, as a text used in class in which the teacher provides the context, it may be fine."
3,"Good to be used in class, but...","A good book to be used in class, but if you want to learn ancient Greek and do not have a teacher, try another, like Athenaze, JACT, or Mastronarde."
4,"Brisk, efficient biography","A ""must"" if you are at all interested in the band. My only criticism would be that it doesn't really dig that deep - but, as mentioned in other reviews, and by Bussy himself, this is due to the lack of information coming from the band themselves rather than a lack of effort and research. This aside, a fascinating look into the Kraftwerk world. I thoroughly enjoyed it - highly recommended."
3,not for all grills,"Nice concept if you have small grillplates..however if you have the cast iron this will not work (they are to wide) even for the larger side of this grillfloss. Will make a nice christmas gift for someone!!!!!!!! LOL "" just not us"""
3,NOT SO GOOD GRILL CLEANER,CHEAPLY MADE. I BENT IT THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. THE END PIECE IS MADE OF VERY THIN METAL AND IS EASILY BENT WHILE SCRAPPING.
2,"Laborious, Tedious & Inefficient","I ordered the Grillfloss with high hopes of quality, efficiency and ease of use. I will state the positive aspects: the Grill Floss is of high quality and of good length. That being said, the $5.45 brush I bought along with this item does a better job. This Grillfloss did not a)do a better job than the bristle brush b)was tedious and far more time consuming c)you can get around ""most"" of each grill rail but not the entire 360 with the way it is assembled. I have a built in Charm Glow stainless steel BBQ, for this type of BBQ this product is a no go. Both sides of the bristle brush have 180 rail cleaner that worked as good. Use a good brush with a rail (edge scraper)cleaner and /or hand wash if your grills are removable. Far more efficient and less costly. Don't waste your time on Grillfloss, it's a dud. Product returned to Amazon."
2,Grill floss tool doesn't fit most grates,I have tried to use the grill floss on two different BBQ's already and both times the grates were either to big or shaped funny for the tool to be useful. The Grill Floss should be adjustable to fit bigger or smaller grates (even grates that are not shaped cylinder) then I would give the tool 4.5 out of 5 stars.
5,A Good Work on Christian Leadership,"This is a very good book on Christian leadership.His Reflections on Deacons,Priesthood and Episcopacy are very illuminating."
4,Was rolling on the floor LMAO!!!,This was such a hilarious and light hearted movie. I don't think my husband and i spent more than a few minutes not laughing at this delightfully funny comedy. The actors were perfect and believable and the setting made it even funnier. Loved the geocaching parts as well it tied everything together nicely and taught me a little about something i didn't even know existed. This will have you laughing til the end. You may even be like my husband and use some of the funny lines and try to do some of the funny stunts that they did as well. Although this isn't recommended. :)
5,If you like SNL....,"I really liked this movie. It is not going to smash any box office records, but this movie is really well written and entertaining. I thought Lutz was great as the Guiness Man. He is one of my favorite characters on 30 Rock, so I was suprised to see him in this movie.Enjoy"
2,Nice plot - disappointed with language,"This could have been a good movie, but profanity simply for the sake of profanity took a lot away from it. Also, most people outgrow the penis jokes at age 14. The writer for this movie evidently hasn't. At least now I know the difference between a ""carny"" and a ""splinterhead!"""
1,"Interesting from a Geocachers point of view, NOT suitable for children, though","The language got a little old for me on this one and I had been hoping to show it to my son to get him jazzed about Geocaching. Fortunately, husband and I watched it ahead of time to see if it was appropriate and we found out within the first five minutes that we'd not be viewing this one as a family.I wouldn't let anyone under sixteen watch this one and I doubt many over sixteen will want to. God love 'em. It has it's moments but ~yawn~"
1,Not very happy.,When I got this cartridge I thought it was a Great deal but soon came to find that the ink didnt last as long as a new one. I had to replace it with a store bought one for twice the amount of money but its still going strong.
5,"So dear to my heart, I had to own it","Unlike the correspondent from San Merino below, I love the non-literary historical and political entries and details. I have found this to be the ultimate source for brushing up on cross-references in books. I've found it most useful when something I'm reading refers to history or another literary work--but I'm momentarily stumped on the details of the reference. Much more efficient to look it up in Benet's than to wander through the library hoping a quickly-glimpsed spine will trigger a memory."
4,A Very Handy book,"Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia is an extremely handy reference to have for classic literature. If you are a crossword puzzle fan, use this book before you go to your puzzle dictionary. It gives clear, concise overviews of artists and their most famous works. I check this book when I am thinking of taking up a book or author that is new to me. I get an idea of what I'm in for."
5,Benet's Tome of Trivia Power,"This is the academic trivia ""Bible."" This is perhaps the best reference for trivia at the college level (for classic trivia rather than popular culture, current events, or science). Nearly all the really good players at the college level have a copy."
3,limited use,I love everything ME does! This book.... I used many of the paper selection on a recent project and was very disappointed. The paper when used with glue sticks had problems! The paper did not adhere well and was difficult to work with. Not sure why buy when I used other paper selections...I did not have any problems. I will use the delightful stickers in the book but will not use the paper for projects.
3,Good but not great compilation,"With any collection like this a mixed bag is expected.The majority of the songs are fairly good but not really memorable i.e. the songs by Liebert,Cusco,Massive Attack,Santana,Ennio Morricone. The highlights are David Lanz's Cristofori's Dream,a tender, romantic tune;Jesse Cook's The Tempest absolutely smokes with flamenco fire, and Eric Johnson's Cliffs of Dover is one of the all time great guitar instrumentals.Most guitarists weep when they hear this piece because they know that if they tried 50 years to come up with a work this good they couldn't.This work alone makes the album worth having."
3,Instrumental Moods,"Virgin's first, Pure Moods, was the greatest in selections, from Enigma to D J Dado. Every selection blended into the next. However, Instrumental Moods blends nicely for the first 8 tracks, then it just goes bland. Still good listening music, but I expected more from this one. Pure Moods is still number one with me."

3,Better off with each artist.,"I just bought the album, and I would suggest buying each artist's complete work rather than this album alone. The tracks aren't arranged in a way that would go about creating a ""mood"" of any sort. Unlike Pure Moods and Pure Moods II, along with Celtic Moods, that have a nice flow to them, ""Instrumental Moods"" jumps around too much for this listener to really enjoy it. Jumping on the ""ban-wagon"" of a ""Moods-esque"" CD, this one lacks the smooth arrangement of the other albums. Specific artists that I liked on the Album were Eric Serra, and Cusco."
3,Bowie Covers Sigue Sigue Sputnik...,"This is a Japanese single (they sell tons of those there), and it features a radio edit of ""Never Get Old"" as well as a cover by Bowie of ""Love Missle F1-11"" originally by Sigue Sigue Sputnik. You have to be a real Bowie fan to really get in to this item. I like the cover, but it's very guitar oriented - a real departure from the original. ""Never Get Old"" is a radio friendly edit, and is just a touch shorter than the album version. Two tracks, some Japanese writing, and a pretty nice photo on the cover."
3,Flesh and Spirit,The book is too generalized. It should dig deeper into the private lives. This book does demonstrate the parental upbringing and the demanding education that young men must endure in Germany.
5,A long deserved expose of the top sleazebag in Congress,"This DVD was produced before Tom DeLay got his just rewards before the courts, but you can see it coming anyway. The ""Republican revolution"" of the 1990s turned into the Republican contest to see who could be the biggest sleazebag, and Tom DeLay was certainly in the running. This documentary pretty much gives him his comeuppance, and if ever there was anyone who deserved some upside-the-head comeuppance, this pest exterminator and pest to end all pests surely did. Highly, highly recommended."
4,Realistic View of Maui,"Good information about things to see and do on Maui. This DVD is clearly not a ""paid advertisement"" plug for businesses on Maui like a lot of DVDs that I have watched. This video gives a realistic look at some of the more interesting things to see and do there without the sales pitch. It gave me some excellent ideas of things that I might want to do when I went there over the holiday. While I am sure you could find more high budget productions, this video gives a potential visitor a good overview of the things to see and do there with just factual information and not all the hype and glitz."
3,Ok collection of artwork (3 and 1/2 stars),"Adult full-color pin-up book (collection of pictures).There are around 32 women in the book. One picture is on a giant page folded into the book. The artwork is quite good; some are sketchy and are very detailed. The woman are in various stages of undress, with some clothed but in transparent or wet garments. A nice collection, though a little to ""just there"" not doing anything.Even though Irvin Bomb's book (Art of Irvin Bomb) is quite similar, there is just something about Bomb's artwork that raises it to the above 4 star level while Mobius' work, while good, falls below that rating. Mobius' artwork just doesn't ""click."""
3,Bad System Great Setting,"The Fifth Age Dragonlance game system uses a card based randomizer rather than the die based system most gamers are used to. In an effort to focus more on role-playing than adventure, the game becomes incredably easy and takes most of the risk out of running your favorite character. I do not like this system at all! However, the world in which the stories of this world take place is a fantastic setting in which to place a traditional AD&D game. With the absence of thier gods (including those of magic), some variants of the magic rules should be used. Imaginative DM's and players should have no trouble coming up with these variants on thier own to create a much more balanced and enjoyable game."
4,"Fifth Age setting alright, but Saga Rules System is great!!!","I bought the Dragonlance: Fifth Age not for the setting, but for the Saga Rules. Imagine TSR producing a diceless RPG, it's crazy! But it is true. The Saga Rules are very, very, very, good and very adaptable. My friend and I always liked the idea of the Shadowrun RPG, but never liked the rules (It required about 1000 d6's to play). But we converted Shadowrun to Saga Rules and it works great. If you are a fan of Dragonlance, get it, and if you are a fan of new, intelligent, and unique rules systems get the Saga Rules System."
2,Yuck.,"Three words: they ruined Krynn. Dragonlance used to be the best campaign setting for D&D, but TSR discontinued the campaign setting boxed set and replaced it with a new game, separate from D&D. The game rules are okay, some interesting concepts, but unfortunately incomplete. The rules are just not completely enough explained to run a game here, so you'll have to buy a bunch of (expensive) game suppliments. Even worse, though, is that they ruined the setting. Fifth Age distorts Krynn in a number of ways, the game world is much less appealing than the old ""Fourth Age"". Unless you have money to burn, I say give this one a pass. If you like the idea of a card-based RPG, I suggest you check out ""Castle Falkenstein""."
3,What happened to Krynn?,"I am quite possibly one of the biggest DragonLance fans ever. However, this game seems like it needs a little change to be a decent game. The first MAJOR flaw is in the spell system that the rules provide. It makes it almost impossible to cast say a fireball spell and inflict any amount of damage on an enemy at all. Then after the spell is cast, it takes forever to regain the magic points lost in its casting. Also the travel system is a little less than desirable. It makes it so that on good terrain (such as a road) you can only go like 5 or 6 miles in a day (I can't remember the actual number but 5 or 6 is in the ballpark. The thing I like the game for is the cool maps and cards that come with it. It could also be a decent game if the players are willing to deviate from the spell and travel systems provided in the rules. A must for any major DragonLance fan, but look to pass it over if you aren't familiar with the series."
5,Wow!!!!,This game is one of the best I have have ever played! I got it for my birthday 2yrs ago and me and my freinds still play it. We don't do that with to many of our toys. I have never read the DragonLance series but I have heard it is good. I just got it and you don't need to have read the series to understand it.
2,"Installation a nightmare, but product works great!","The quality of this receiver seems quite good, but the manual translated from Japanese is the worst I have ever seen. If you buy this, it is probably best to ignore the manual - even the Denon technical person said the manual contained many errors due to translation - the wiring diagrams are useless. I have a DirecTV HD DVR, DVD recorder, CD player, 5.1 Surround Sound with ""Zone2"" speakers throughout house, and HD TV with 5 inputs (one HDMI). The HDMI setup to the TV was simple, the DVD Recorder video had to go directly to TV, with audio through VCR-1; the manual is wrong. If you use Zone2, make sure you set P.Amp Assign of Surround Back to Zone2.Bottom line: prepare to spend considerable time getting this to work!Update - Now that I am more familiar with the product I would increase my rating, but due to the installation issues (and poor manual) the pruct must take a hit."
1,Wrong edition,"Not the Illustrated Junior Edition depicted on Amazon. Illustrations in edition I received are pedestrian, childish. I am disppointed and feel short-changed. Definetly nmore thrift store than collectable edition."
3,"Great Music, OK story, occasionally stupid dialogue",OK if you don't like Strait's music you're unlikely to stick with this movie. BUT the music really does make this flick. The story is actually not all that outrageous though there are some really lame lines in several places. This is not a critics movie; it's a movie for people who like the leading man to get the girl and for the bad guy to get what's coming to him but if you can tolerate some predictability and like George Strait's music this is really not a bad way to spend just shy of two hours. The part that many will like is that this boy-meets-girl story relies not at all on their sleeping together but rather getting to know each other and spending time together.
4,"""Good Drama!""","George Strait, Lesley Ann Warren and Isabel Glasserstar in this 1992 drama. A country singer goes backto his roots and finds romance. I've always likedthis film and George is great in it. This dvd hasdecent picture and sound, but only trailers.I recommend this good drama."
5,Beautiful love story,"A movie the whole family can enjoy. Kids love horses and the music is great, too. Lifts the spirits of everyone."
1,Cheep re production,This is a very cheep copy of the movie the sound quality is very bad.with captions at the bottom of the screne
2,Some decent music but otherwise pretty corny,"George Strait makes a decent screen debut in this otherwise boring, by-the-numbers story about a country music star who decides to take a break from the bright lights of fame and go back to his rural roots. The other actors such as Leslie Ann Warren pretty much just go through the motions in this mostly predictable and not very believable film. It may be worth seeing if you're a fan of old-fashioned love stories or country music (and some of the music here is pretty good, even for this non-country fan:) ), but if you want an original and exciting film, look elsewhere."
3,Pure Country really is pure country,"what better way to have a movie called Pure Country than to have GeorgeStrait star in it. Okay, the movie is a little corny, but George'ssinging makes up for it. A true guilty pleasure especially with LeslieAnn Warren chewing up the scenery with her tough girl part."
4,strait to the movies,"first of all let's be honest. george strait is not an actor. it's one thing to make great country songs and videos, but another to carry A film. But like everything he does, george's less is best policy works for pure country. He doesn't try to over extend his acting abilitys and instead uses his music and natural abilities to look good and be relaxed at movie making. Diehard George Strait fans will love this movie that makes the best of George and his abilitys. Credit goes to director Chis Cain for making the most of George's talent and putting together A good movie for him to be proud of."
4,George Strait gives great musical perfomance,"If you like country music this is your fairy tale. Dusty (George) is tired of the glitz and glamour of his growing success. He takes a pilgrimage to his roots to find his true inspiration. Armed with his original guitar, George returns to his band to perform the way he likes, one man, one guitar, no lights, no smoke. This is a great story with awesome George Strait music."
2,Pure waste of time,"I remembered viewing this film in theatres back in '92 (I was probably the only one to see it!) when I bumped into the cassette in the drama section at Blockbuster. Since only the title was familiar to me, not the plot, I rented the tape. No it's not memorable by all means. In fact, it's generally disappointing. This is a hackneyed tale of a country music star who goes back to his roots where nobody remembers who he is and falls in love.The love between the woman and the singer is unconvincing, the characters aren't in the least interesting, the plot is totally predictable, and the film is overlong. Like many musicians turned actors, George Strait tries his best but is often not very good."
1,The worst I ever seen,"I wasted almost 30 argentine pesos in a movie that is one of the worst I've ever seen. To see Lesley Ann Warren wasted in a movie like this makes me want to cry my heart out.Only the soundtrack is good, and please tell George Strait to stop acting, he sings very well, but his acting is not good at all."
5,Amazon is 5 Stars All the Way!,This is not really a review on this particular item...but with Amazon itself. I have been shopping for years with Amazon and never once have been disappointed. I get up to date emails about my orders...they are shipped out right away and received in less than a week and I have never had to return anything :) This particular item was a gift for my 15 year old daughter. I was not able to find it in stores so I went to Amazon...where you can always find what you need...and the price was perfect ( cheaper than in the stores)I ordered it with ease and got it in like 5 days. Amazon makes shopping easy!
5,Small Town Life USA!!,"I love this movie, I love movies about small town life.I'm a country boy at heart, even if I live in the DFW Metroplex.I'm also a fan of George Strait, I've listen to him since I was ateenager.Country & rock music is in the bloodline.I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!"
4,Totally happy,Excellent film and a lot cheaper on Amazon than most Australian sites. Made hubby very happy indeed. Thanks Amazon
2,LOVE THIS MOVIE but hate the closed captioning,This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Finally broke down and bought it. Except the Closed Captioning is on during the entire movie and you can't turn it off. It really sucks. :( Probabaly gonna go to Walmart or Target and get another copy of this and maybe sell this one in a yard sale or something. Gonna have to watch what I buy from this webcite.
2,Really Pure Countryside Film,"This film version is purely taken place in a countryside of America, beautiful love story, but purposely I bought this DVD because I am one of George Strait fans, I got his CD songs but I was curiously interested to watch the movie. The story is short as I think, but quite entertaining to attend!"
5,wonderful,"this movie made my wife and I fall deeper in love and we shared a wonderful happy cry together, and a long wonderful kiss at the end when the song cross my heart played"
5,Love it!,Wow! This was a fast shipment and I can't wait to sit down and watch it. Thanks for good service!
3,Kens Review,Given as a Christmas Gift.. input received indicated they are George Strait fans and thought it was good but not up to their expectations.
4,Cute,"I have never been a George Strait or country music fan. It was my boyfriend who ""encouraged"" me to watch this movie. I was reluctant at first, not really thinking it was going to be my type of movie, but I thoroughly enjoyed this story! :) It was a country fairy tale!"
5,Good Country Romance,"In addition to being a very good singer/songwriter,George Strait proves he can act. I fell in love with his song he sang to his lady. That song is still in my mind."
4,This is a great movie,This movie brings a softer side of George Strait instead of his ability to sing he can also act. Loved it
4,Pure Country,This is a good movie if you like George Strait as I do. It's a good family movie. I had seen it years ago and was unable to find a copy locally. I received it very quickly from Amazon and am very pleased with the service rendered.
2,"Has a Few Problems - Hate this Copy, Love the Movie","I had a few problems with this DVD. I grew up on this movie and love it, so my 2 stars is for the product itself.First off, I put the DVD in my player on the widescreen side. Unfortunately, no matter which side I put the disc on, it was full-screen format. Second, the sound isn't that great. The movie hasn't been enhanced in any way, shape, or form. The sound is that of a VHS and those gross little white specks from older, non-enhanced films make quite a few appearances. I was hoping it would have been upgraded to be compatible with surround systems. Lastly, and thank God it's fixable, subtitles are always turned on when you start the movie. At first, I thought I accidentally hit the button, but when I turned the movie off halfway through and resumed later, I found that it was something to be dealt with every time.While I did enjoy the movie, I'm not happy with the DVD release."
3,Proves there are more important things than good acting,"I think at least one reviewer actually thought George Strait had a ""wonderfully understated"" acting style, which is partially true -- it's so understated you spend half the movie looking for it. Luckily by the second half you've realized the music is so good it doesn't matter if he can act. They should have had Kyle Chandler/Buddy Jackson stand in for George/Dusty off the stage rather than on it. Leslie Ann Warren waves her hands and grits her teeth a lot, but her clothes speak louder than words, and the two best characters -- Grandma Ivy and Earnest -- make the whole thing worth it. Well, Ivy, Earnest, and George Strait's butt in Wranglers. As long as you're not expecting an Oscar-winning performance by George, enjoy the movie. He's the best ""strait"" man ever, because he doesn't know how to be any other way."
3,home spun,"it was OK good actors fair acting weak story line. george should stick to singing, if your a country fan see it by all means if not dont bother"
3,Entertaining,"Another ""wonder if my life were different"" type movie from the perspective of someone who already has a better life than most. Its not a bad movie."
3,Exhausting!!!,"Certainly THE bible in the construction industry. The problem is the depth to which this book delves in discussing rather dry, mundane topics. I guess if someone needs to know just about anything in construction, it's here, but be forewarned that there is an IMMENSE amount of information that must be waded through in order to find a specific piece of information. Often used as a textbook in Constructing 101 since it is so exhaustive in its scope (we spent an entire semester on only 1 chapter!). Also makes good reading for insomniacs."
2,Didn't work,"This product might work for some folks, but didn't work for my fiancée. Again, maybe it works for some, but it's a very very simple pill, and didn't provide any relief."
5,Relief!,"I've had UT/bladder/frequent urination issues for years....years! I started considering the prescription drugs being advertised on TV. I did some research online and eventually found out about Prelief. It took some doing finding this product at the stores. After trying it, in a matter of days, my issues were no longer issues. My only fear is this product will no longer be available."
5,"""Riveting Case Studies . . . ""","The back cover of PILOTING AT NIGHT says, ""Full of riveting case studies, this clear and concise guide illustrates . . ."" and then goes on to celebrate the technical aspects of the book. Without devaluing the technical astuteness of Bjork's book, I would have to say that the real selling point for this book and for Bjork's other book (PILOTING FOR MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE) are the riveting case studies, the descriptions of real-life flying experiences. For anyone who has experienced the disheartening boredom of wading through a technical textbook, Bjork's book will be a refreshing change. Bjork's entertaining case studies provide a concrete way to understand and begin to apply the abstract concepts that are part of any handbook. An excellent book."
2,"Good for technique, not so good for inspiration","I was looking for some inspiration, but the furniture was prettyuninteresting. Only the cover piece was at all bold -- everything else pretty predictable."
2,Not really what I thought it would be,"I thought this book would be a simple ""how to"" book. It offers several projects; many look pretty darn complicated for the person looking for ""simple techniques"" as the title suggests. I was pretty disappointed."
1,Sucky gun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this for my son and the first time he used it, it fell APART!! I am not at all impressed with it. If u want something for your children, go someplace else!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,I should have read the reviews closer,"I got this for the amazing belt. Look at one of the reviewers pictures. Its a garbage ugly nylon plastic thing of a belt. Not even a copy of the one in the picture. Also the gun has a bright orange cap. Which is fine, but just realize the picture is not what youre getting."
3,Great toy with some brittle parts,"I had the same issue as others, the latch that holds the cylinder and barrel to the body, just above the hammer, is made of plastic and wears down/breaks after awhile. I just ended up using JB weld and gluing the pieces together, so that the cylinder still rotated. You just can't put caps in it any more, but my son has been playing with it like that for over three years now and the trigger, cylinder rotation and hammer action all still work. So over all, with a little glue, it's a great toy."
2,Paris Big Tex Holster Set,It is a well put together toy but has some defects in the firing mechanism. The clip that holds the barrel and cylinder for the caps in place is made of plastic and can come loose quiet easily. Also the lever to advance to the next cap sometimes jams.
2,Big Tex Not So Big On Wear,gave to 3yr. old grand son. did not take long for the chamber to start popping open when the trigger was pulled.
2,Broken already...,"As other reviews state this gun seemed great at first. After about 2 weeks the latch that opens the gun to swich out the caps broke. It would still stay in place except my son likes to pretend to ""fast-draw"" and it would fly open every time he pulled it out of the holster. Today something in the trigger mechanism broke so the gun no longer fires the caps and is officially broken. Both parts that broke are plastic. Disappointed!! Should have bought the 50 year old cap gun I saw at the auction...appears to have held up better than any other ones I keep buying."
2,Disapointed,"When this toy came in the mail I was very excited, but after a week and a half of play it broke on me. It was made in Italy and almost full metal but became unusable after a short period of time. I will hope for a refund. This product was disappointing. :("
3,Big Tex Holster Set,"Purchased the Big Tex Holster Set for Western Themed Halloween Costume. I agree with previous reviews in that the plastic retainer holding the gun shut will eventually wear out and break which is too bad because the rest of the gun is sturdy. When originally ordered, I was sent the Doc Holiday Version instead and although it has a metal retainer holding the gun shut, most of the gun is plastic and painted metal colors! Go Figure! Anyhow, durability of the Big Tex was not that important as mentioned, I only needed the pistol for Halloween Costume. One additional note is the cheap holster set. The Belt included was not the leather look as in the picture but a cheap canvas one with a plastic buckle so I substituted my regular leather brown belt."
5,For all boys who love to play cowboy...,"Well, my 9-yr-old son wanted a toy cowboy gun. He had fallen in love with a small cheap crome version, and it broke. When I surprised him with the 'Big Tex' he was sooo happy. It was exactly what he wanted.... it is sturdy well made and authentic looking. One word of caution: the Big Tex is mad of metal, so it's not for very young boys, but rather for well-behaved older boys who will not attempt to 'pistol-whip'... so for the tikes stick to lightweight plastic. Enjoy!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This cap gun is an absolute joke. The ONLY thing it has going for it, is the fact that it is not plastic. But that is where it begins and where it ends. The caps are next to impossible to remove once fired. If you do buy this, then you will also have to give your child a pair of needle nose pliers, or a flathead screwdriver for cap removal. The caps that this uses are all but silent. My five year old can snap his fingers louder than these things are...that is the ones that actually do fire. This cap gun has many ""misfires"" All in all, I would recommend going to Wal-Mart and buying the cheap orange plastic one they have for $8.00. It is a much better cap gun. I promise your child will be very disappointed with this cap gun. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!! BE YE WARNED!!"
3,Gun & holster,"Fairy heavy metal gun, but trigger and handle got loose after very little use. Very real looking though."
1,Broken out of the package,"The breech lock would not stay in place. Basically have to hold the gun closed with one hand and fire with the other. This proved impossible as the child we gave it to as a gift has use of just one hand due to a brain tumer. I would try to return the gun, however the boy is only expected to live a few more days and he likes to just hold it anyway. VERY disappointing."
4,"Great gun, decent holster, cheap belt.","We couldn't find a gun with a holster locally so we bought this online. The gun itself is great. It looks great, is heavy and seems like a quality gun that will last a while. We did not buy caps yet so I can't say whether or not it fires well, but my son enjoys ""shooting"" it just the same. He's 6. The holster is just plastic, I think, but is adequate. The belt is just plain cheap and the buckle does not secure well. It did not look like the one pictured online. We swapped it out with my son's regular leather belt and that works much better."
2,Poor quality,The pistol lasted less than 10 days before breaking. Part of the cast iron receiver cracked then fell off. My son was really enjoying the gun before it broke.
1,Holster,"Very cheap product and do not buy for an adult costume, which is why we got this. More for a kid and the belt is small. Very very cheap so you get what you pay for."
3,Champagne Belt,"This is a great replica of a cowboy belt with holsters, but it comes in a pinkish color! I had to use some vinyl color spray paint to get it right!"
1,Tape required to keep the barrel from falling forward.,"We bought these for three boys last Christmas. They were not rough on the guns, they only played with them normally. Two broke in one week; the plastic piece broke causing the barrel to fall open every time the trigger was pulled. The third one broke a couple of weeks later. The guns are still being played with only because they are being held together with black electrical tape."
2,Meh.,"The Gun is pretty much as it appears in the photo/description on the page. I don't plan on firing it, so I can't speak to it's functionality as a cap gun. I purchased the gun/holster/belt to be part of a Halloween costume, and authenticity was important to me. However, the holster and belt are absolutely trash - the cheapest, most unrealistic looking things I've seen - not AT ALL like what is pictured! A cloth belt and terrible, gold plastic buckle is what come with the gun. How can they not show what you truly get?!"
1,Bait and switch!,"What a ripoff! That picture you see is NOT the product. I bought it as a Halloween prop but it's just a small cheap plastic kid's toy. That leather looking belt in the picture is actually a 32 inch long piece of brown canvas with a tiny plastic buckle. Useless, it went straight into the trash. The holster is cheap plastic and looks like cheap plastic. The gun, at least, is metal, but it's tiny too. I'd send it back but it's not worth the trouble.Don't fall for it, if you need a Halloween costume prop, keep looking."
4,Great Toys for Our Triplets - BE CAREFUL OF AMAZON,"We gave 3 of the Big Tex Holster Sets to our Triplet Grandsons for Christmas. They loved them & play with them almost daily.They are good quality and should stand up for a long time. I'd recommend them for any parent or grandparent to give their kids.*UNFORTUNATELY, AMAZON CHARGED US FOR SHIPPING. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE FREE SUPER SAVER ON ORDERS OVER $25.00. WELL, 3 SETS OF THESE CERTAINLY EXCEEDED $25.00. WATCH OUT FOR AMAZON'S FALSE CHARGES. IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME I'VE HAD THIS HAPPEN!!!ED"
4,Makes my son happy,"I bought this for my son so he can have 2 realistic toy cowboy guns. He is the cowboy faze of his life right now so he watched Young Guns and Bonanza to see how a cowboy should be. He runs around the house drawing the guns and pointing at us or his friends saying ""I'll make you famous"". He has gotten all his little buddies into the cowboy stuff so I guess he now has a real posse.As for the gun, belt and holster goes, the gun should hold up to last his cowboy faze which I thinking about a year. The belt and holster are made cheaply and will not hold up in the long run. However the prize piece is the gun so I guess that is what is most important."
4,Great Gun cheap holder,"The Gun is really great, metal with plastic handle (expected for the price), with orange tip on it. Did not come with any caps, but it is great item for the price."
5,Awesome cap gun,"This is the best cap gun I've ever had. They're usually cheap plastic. This one is durable metal, and fires like a champ. Very cool."
4,12 ring caps no good vs 8 ring caps,There is a video [...] on u tube that tells you that the 12 ring caps do not work well and you should buy 8 ring caps and cut the ring and put it in the 12 ring gun. If you bought 12 ring caps from them they will will send you free of charge 8 ring caps.
3,"looks good, doesnt hold up.","bought 2 for boys, after just a few days, the plastic clip holding barrel opens and barrel falls open, other one trigger problems. kids still like them, but they don't hold up."
5,WOW.............,This gun is a little heavy and would think it would be hard for a smaller child to hold. Bought it for my 6 year old for Christmas and it turned out to be a huge hit. I remember this gun when I was little but mine was more cheaply built and only a 6 shot. This gun is a 12 shot. Do not buy the cap refills that is recommended when pulling this gun up. The refills are for 6 shot and will not fit. I also could not find them on Amazon and had to look elsewhere. With that being said I would still buy this gun again. Plan on buying one for my nephew for his birthday.
3,"Looks more ""authenitc"" than it really is","The gun was actually pretty cool, very heavy and realistic but the actual belt and holster were terrible. It appears to be heavy good quality plastic or even a good attempt at fake leather but when I put it on my son it was way too big and wouldnt stay in place.....great gun terrible belt"
4,Old West Fun,Great authentic looking pistol. Works smoothly and provides your little cowpoke hours of cowboy imagination. Sometimes tough to find 12 shot ring caps available and the holster belt was not as nice as I had hoped it would be.
2,Looks great but plastic part inside broke quickly,"We bought this becuase it looked like it was all metal, however there is a small plastic part inside that broke rather quickly causing the gun not to stay shut."
5,big texan,This is a great gun just to get that of I actually have 4 of them and as every body says the little plastic part can break only one of minie did this toy is a very realistic toy gun so be carful keep the orange tip on!!! I use my guns in moviesso have fun 5 stars really nice
1,"Awful cap gun, do NOT buy. Complete waste of money.","This gun is so poorly made that you can NOT take out the caps without using a knife or something sharp after each use. Often times it doesn't rotate to the next cap either. Do not buy, poorly made junk."
4,Sheriff Daddy needed a gun,"I bought this gun and holster for my husband so he could be ""Sheriff Daddy"" at our son's 5th birthday party. The gun is surprisingly heavy which makes it feel solid. The only negative comment is the belt part seems a bit thin. He'll probably use his own belt. Otherwise, this should be perfect for his costume."
2,Did not live long,"I am sad to report that this plant did not live more than a month or two. It looked nice upon arrival; nicely packed and fresh. I noticed that the top of the pot was jammed with green fertilizer balls so I decided to remove all the access fertilizer and check the roots. The roots were so knotted and filled with fertilizer it looked like it was suffocating. I carefully removed the fertilizer and what soil there was and washed the roots and repotted in a new similar sized pot in bonsai soil. I followed the included directions and within tow weeks, the leaves shriveled and started falling off. I am not a beginner when it comes to plants so I was shocked when this plant ""died"". I did not contact the seller. Seeing how the plant/roots were treated did not leave a good feeling with me. Not sure if I would purchase from the same seller again."
1,Dead Plant upon arrival,"I have ordered the Dwarf Pre-Bonsai Plant for my cousin's birthday. The plant was supposed to be a surprise. Unfortunatly, I have received a phone call from him saying what is this dry tree supposed to be for. He send me pictures and video and I was shocked to see a plant that looks nothing like the picture that is being advertised on amazon.com. Never buy plants on line. That is the lesson of my life."
5,Excellent water filter,We have well water...This filter is an excellent whole house filter for sediment and rust issues. We have standardized upon these in our home.
2,This is an old collection of games.,This is an old collection of games. The first games are from the MacDonnell - La Bourdanaisse match of 1834. The last games are from 1951. The book is in old descriptive notion. Coles is the author and Reinfeld simply checked the annotations. Coles was looking for hard fought games and not necessarily the most briliantly played games which makes this an interesting collection. There is almost a minimal amount of annotations and diagrams. Chernov's Most Instructive Games of Chess is from about the same period and certainly a better buy than this.
4,A reference book for the grammar of Scottish Gaelic,"This explanation of the grammar of Scottish Gaelic grammar to English speaking learners is clearly laid out, particularly in the contents page. The vocabulary is limited but sufficient. The exercises are translations between Gaelic and English - a rather old-fashioned approach. This book can be viewed as a useful adjunct to a more modern, orally-based course, for an inquisitive or assiduous learner. The orthographic conventions are not modern but not intrusive."
3,Be careful using the product,"I researched this product, and many people worldwide use it with good results for itch and other skin and scalp problems, but do recommend to mix with olive oil. Some sites say people can be allergic or have skin too sensitive for this product use. I have not used it yet, am debating whether to try the bottle I bought or not."
2,"Good Reference, Bad Textbook","While certainly an expert on the Greek of the New Testament, Swetnam has little grasp on how to convey this knowledge to a wider audience. He presents the material in a mismatched fashion, introducing vocabulary which he never uses in the exercises, and never buidling on previous lessons. He also carries many assumptions, such as assuming that the reader has some grasp of Latin grammer.That having been said, this text is ideal as a reference for competent Koine Greek students; his vocabulary is expansive, and his treatment of accents is especially thourough (if somewhat dry)."
2,"Good Reference, Bad Textbook","This text is good for lists or paradigms and offers lessons with answers. Learning the Greek language will require other texts. I have read several other Greek Grammar texts which provide an understanding of the language and the connection between Greek and the other Indo European languages. The person attempting the study of this beautiful and rich language would do better with A Greek Grammar of the New Testament Vaughan/Gideon, An Exegetical Grammar of the Greek New Testament Chamberlain, A New Short Grammar of the Greek Testament by Robertson and Davis and leaving this text on the shelf."
2,Movie Review,"This movie went from discovering skeletons in an underground ""dungeon"" to searching for a missing person."
4,A Great Documentary!...,"In The Big Dream, is a great documentary that shows intimate moments of the band at the studio with bassist Tony Levin's company. This video documentary contains footage and short interviews of every member of the ABWH band, inserted between some videos of the first ABWH album aside the live concert track ""Heart Of The Sunrise"" (taken from the DVD live concert ""AN EVENING OF YES MUSIC PLUS""), where the participation of bassist Jeff berlin is a little bit unapreciated because his tone bass doesn't sound with the power of the lines that Chris Squire used to play with the Yes group, and the almost inexistent camera takes to him on the production. Finally, another point is that the best song of the first ABWH album, BIRTHRIGHT, unfortunately is not in this video. Why?...but whatever it is, this is still a great documentary for the neophyte or the Yes fan... Good Luck!"
4,"good book, objective for the most part","Going in to this book I thought it would be more biased towards the libertarian side but it is surprisingly objective. I like how it goes into great detail about the various aspects of the Patriot Act such as the various monitoring methods used by the FBI, how they work and legal challenges of each. The book is very fact based, giving Supreme Court decisions and referencing the Constitution to support his points (such as the enemy combatant piece of the Patriot Act being totally unconstitutional). I'm a young person and I've learned if you want to be truly educated on our government and the legislation they propose, you need to seek out knowledge before forming an opinion, otherwise your vote as a citizen will do no good in progressing America forward. Watching tv news and listening to talk radio will get you nowhere in understanding how decisions are made in Washington, and when to tell when a politician is off base when it comes to the Constitution."
5,"Fast delivery, wrong cable","While the description is fine, I was under the impression that this cable was for the Blackberry Storm. But it turns out, it's not. Too big. If you are looking for a Blackberry Storm cable, it is called ""Micro USB Cable"". Hope it helps other people. Transaction was fast and as a product and a seller - no complaints... Should have done my research!"
1,BAD DESCRIPTION: This is a mini-USB cable for OLD blackberries only,"This is a mini USB cable for OLD blackberries only. Blackberries all use micro USB now due to the EU law about standardization. The pictures are not clear and it doesn't say, which seems to have led to more wrong purchases than right purchases.Modern blackberries use ""micro usb"""
5,Great Service,The turnaround on this was super fast. The product was just what I needed.Many Thanks!
3,"Not Johnny's best, but still not bad","While Winter is definately not the same as he was even just 10 years ago, let alone 20, this ain't that bad of an effort. The vocals are weak, but his playing still has some fire to it and the song selection is pretty good. I wish he wasn't sick because he is such a great talent."
4,This is a fine Johnny Winter CD,"Yeah, he was having issues that made him vocally seem half dead, but the guitar cranks on beautifully. I have many different performances of Hideaway and find this one the best of all. This is a great album, especially to introduce a young person to Johnny Winter. There is nothing offensive on this album (no songs about killing his woman or that sort of stuff, which has it's place--the songs not killing of course). The guitar on this album is beautiful. I would have given it 5 stars but for the wasted voice."
2,johnny dissappoints with live album,"the rumors of johnny winters failing health and diminished guitar playing skills hit you right in the face in a lackluster live album from the once fiery albino. his vocals a very lethargic and his guitar solos are quite a struggle for a man who use to breeze across the guitar neck. for a non musician this is a listenable album with some good arrangements of classic blues songs, but for anyone who grew up knowing the skills of this guitar legend, this album is a sobering slap in the face."
4,"Great job,of this powerful bluesman!","Really this isn't the best job of Johnny,but what we can hear is a man linked with his best roots. The musics choosed are allright;the vocal is still perfectly;the way to play guitar,...ohhh! Really a great album of a great bluesman! Terrific!"
4,j winter blues at his best,as a winter fan for as long as he has played i think this tape is a must for the consumant blues listener. hideaway and sen-sa-shun/mojo and johnny guitar just dont get any better......
2,nothing exciting,"The recording itself, sonically, is ok but nothing special. If it was, I think I would have enjoyed it more. The performance is lackluster."
4,This CD grows on you the more you listen to it!!,Just another example of Johnny's virtuosity as a musician and a guitarist!
1,Boring & Mono dimensional,"As a big fan of Johnny's for many years I eagerly awaited the release of this album. Much to my disapointment it is not up to snuff. First, Johnny sings without his customary ""growl."" In fact, he sounds more like Buck Owens than a blues singer. Second, he plays through a phase shifter or flanger effect box on every song! Now, I can see using it here or there for effect--but every song! The volume of Johnny's guitar is a steady warbled drone, as though under water, and the band reminds one of an uninspired, beer gorged, garage band. The guitars solos, which are usually what one buys a Johnny Winter record for, are trite, repetitive, predictable, pap. No fire here folks. If you liked, Johnny's first album on Columbia, or Still Alive & Well, or Third Degree, -- you will think he has completely lost it after hearing this album -- it is, absolutely, the weakest album Johnny has ever made. All the same we're looking forward to his next effort. Hint: ditch the effects box!"
5,Outstanding set of instructional DVDs,"Professional format, techniques presented in a clear, easy to understand manner. Watching Mike Swain's execution of these techniques is awesome."
2,Changed Soap formula makes a great soap with a slightly repulsive oder,"Dove apparently didn't think their soap was mild enough, so removed all the scented oils that made the soap have a lightly pleasant scent. Dove told me that the oils were meant to cover the original smell of the soap, and I can understand why they were needed. The soap now smells mildly repulsive, if you are sensitive to smell. They no longer make or carry the original formula, nor do they ever intend to. Shopping for a new soap . . ."
2,title of review,"Reminds me a bit of Autechre and Fennesz, except more minimalist and rilly sucky. This guy is pretty talentless at music. He has a decent grasp of sound texturing and rhythm, but when it comes to melody and harmony he's completely inept. Wasp Wisp is decent because it capitalises on texture in a way that makes melody and harmony almost redundant, creating a buzzing drone that sounds like a sparking severed electrical wire. It reminds me of Pan Sonic. Most of the other songs are just total poop."
1,The Barn doghouse,"I ordered this doghouse and rec it a couple of days ago. It's a cute doghouse, but much over priced for the quality. 2 of the pieces were broken...wood is much too ligh-weight for the price. Instructions are poor, had to rely on the picture of it on the boxes. I don't believe this product is a good value for the money."
2,The Barn DogHouse,"It is a very pretty doghouse, but not hard enough. Our dog ate most of the wood in the house the following day. I think that for big dogs the wood does not work."
2,Below aberage,This book simply did not serve the purpose for whihc I purchased it. It was very shallow and not very well written. It did not serve the purpose...
1,Beware -- there are only 30 pads in this package,"The photo being shown for this product is of the carton that holds 100 count. Besides the photo, there is no mention in the product details of the number of pads in the package. I therefore only assumed it was what was shown in the photo. It seemed to be a great deal and was also shippable under Amazon Prime. However, upon receipt of my order today, what was shipped was the package with only 30 count. I will be returning it back to Amazon tomorrow. Needless to say, this is a gross misrepresentation by the seller and tarnishes the Amazon Prime brand."
1,"not a comment on the performance or recording, just the format","This is *not* a hybrid CD, just a plain SACD, which you can get 80% cheaper elsewhere."
2,"Too many notes, too little music","If these fine musicians were paid by notes they played on this concert, they'd be richer than Rockefeller. Self-indulgent and shallow musical race of the three virtuoso guitarists. Check the rest of discography of McLaughlin, De Lucia, (and even) DiMeola and you'll find many musical gems. This record, however, is better left forgotten."
1,Great Webbing + Inadequate fastener,"The plastic is about 1/8th thick on both sides of the buckle and will break on the first strain, or even when first used to wrap any luggage.Got 2, both broke before even ""taking off""!Item: UPC 21276 91085 id: AR1085BK12ATS made by E&B; Giftware, Mt. Vernon (hint, hint<g>) for Samsonite. No warrantee, brought back to the store within 48 hours. No refund! Nuff said. Product should have stayed in China.This product damages Samsonite's reputation."
2,Poor design,I was leery of the buckle when I bought this strap. It broke on the very first trip after being handled by the airlines. Don't waste your money on this item. Get a strap with a good metal buckle instead.
4,Strong characters AND science,"This is a great read and a VERY solid debut. Not only is the female lead capable yet appealingly vulnerable, the science is also novel and interesting, particularly the star drive (the implications of relativity are fully considered), Asaro's rendition of telepathic cyberspace (though she loses a point for calling it ""psiberspace,"" groan -- along with all the other ""psi"" words like ""psicon""), and the relationship between the aristos and their providers. I did enjoy coinage like ""heartbender"" (for psychiatrist). I've read the beginning of the next one off the shelf in the bookstore and had to force myself to put it back (can't afford to buy every book I want in hardcover so will reluctantly wait for the PB of ""Catch the Lightning""). OK, so I figured out how it was going to end pretty easily, but it was one HELL of a fun ride getting there"
4,One of the best book. Just behind Sword of Truth collection.,I love you're book. Thought it's not the best. Keep up the good work
4,A brilliant first novel of political intrigue & romance,The novel is a fast paced story of political intrigue on a galactic scale. It is the first novel in a long time which uses psi senses in such a believable manner. I found her design of the three civilizations quite well structured. Ms. Asaro uses the romantic elements in fine style. I simply did not wish to put down the book.
2,"WOW, I didn't like this book!","In reading the other reviews of this book, I discovered the writer is female physist. That makes a lot of sense, the main character is a middle-aged very powerful woman. It reads something like the fantasy of a powerful middle aged woman. I mean, the story itself is OK. If written differently, I could have enjoyed it. It had points where it read like a trashy romance novel, this woman and her younger boy-toys in sex scenes that were a little too vivid. It's science tech was very elaborate and well thought out, and sometimes described in such detail that it detracted from the story. Maybe re-written as ""made for Sci-Fi Channel movie' the story would be enjoyable, it certainly has some interesting ideas, but as presented in this book, my suggestion would be to pass it up."
5,very profound and wise book!,"David Kyle's book is very deep and provides a path to personal wisdom. I am drawn to it and wish that I had the courage to learn and practice all that he has written. I find that it is not a quick read but like a fine wine, should be savored slowly and enjoyed. If you want to become a great leader through achieving personal wisdom, then this is the book for you. If you want to develop your depth as an effective and mature person, then this is a great book for learning how to achieve wisdom and maturity.I recommend it to anyone and everyone."
1,Where is this story going???,"This book starts off really well, the story seems legit and the characters begin to have life and then, after the first chapter or so, they all lose interest in their own story line. Like the last few novels from this author, major disappointment. I couldn't even finish it and I'm getting my money back!!"
2,Sleazy Sex,"Does a man fall into deep, passionate, soul-scorching love with a woman after one night of sex? Lust, maybe, but never love, yet this is one of the premises of this inane book. Out of desperation for something to read, I attempted another Stella Cameron book--same scenario. This kind of sleazy sex is so boring. The author's fantasy that sleazy sex results in love and marriage is not only not realistic, its laughable. I hope no teenage girls get a hold of these books. They might then conclude that having sex after knowing a man only a few hours is the way to find a husband. And what about AIDS? This book is just really disgusting and really stupid."
1,This is one of the worst books I have ever read!,"Bryon is a complete jerk, whose actions are irrational and inconsistent. The dialogue belongs in the first book ever attempted by an aspiring author. The plot is also illogical. Did the author start the book and forget where she wanted to go plot wise? I urge everyone to buy some other book--any book!"
5,Trash bins for bruder garbage truck,I am sure my grandson loves them. I bought them as part of the garbage truck I bought him for Christmas.
2,Bin,"Very over priced. There cute and add to the fun for the child, but come on.....isn't that over priced for plastic?"
5,Dumpster is a big hit!,My grandson was delighted with the extra set of garbage cans to add to his garbage toy collection - especially the dumpster - that was really a big hit! Good quality product although the little handles on the garbage cans could be stronger as they take a lot of use/abuse.
4,Fun addition bit pricey,"If you have a garbage truck from Bruder they hook right up and they are a fun addition. They allow ""more stops"" and more trash to be loaded. The bigger silver dumpster doesn't work with the side loader ( model 2763) which my son has. It may work with a Bruder rear loader which we do not own. The Silver dumpster is fun though for him to load up. If you look at dumpsters in Germany, they Silver model is something you may see on the streets but not in the US, however it holds trash and if your Son or Daughter likes playing with the trucks, it doesn't mater at all. The tall cans are the same as you may have already received from buying another Bruder truck. Overall they seem a bit pricey for what you get but thats what they cost and there are no others. Not disappointed at all, quality plastic and fun for the kid but you just know they could cost less."
3,Trash Bins,"My son is six and really enjoys using these trash bins for various things, but mostly he enjoys using them with his Bruder trash truck. Unfortunately he cannot use the biggest bin with his particular Bruder garbage truck."
4,Waste Management toys,"My 6 year old has been fascinated for several years with anything related to Waste Management. These trash bins will be a great addition to his collection of refuse trucks. The items arrived intact in its packaging, and prior to estimated delivery, despite ordering just days before Christmas."
4,Great if your child LOVES the trash man / trash cans... Trash.,"My son loved a trash can that went along with his huge trash truck. A ""friend"" came over and broke it. We'd been looking for a replacement that didn't involve spending another $30 on the trash truck/can combo just for the trash can. These did the trick. They don't attach to the truck as the previous one, but they're small enough to hold in his (2 year old) hand and bring around with him from place to place."
3,Good for camping and emergency supply,"Got this mostly for camp water. Dosent come with hardware for the nozzle to tighten on the bottom side of the bucket. Just go to your hardware store and pick up a nylon bolt. Be careful it is seems fragile but, most ceramic filters are."
3,Ehhhh..........not that great,The hair can be styled easily enough but the makeup is barely visible. Not much fun.
3,Won't hold curl,"In the box this looked great. A perfect Ariel head with great accessories. We got it out of the box and right away the actual hair was not the best. It already looked a tangled mess after 5 minutes. The curlers it comes with won't hold in the thin hair. I purchased other curlers to use, but the hair still won't hold a curl. My 5 year old still like sto play hair and put pony tails in it, but for a styling head I would have though it would hold the curl."
3,Rocky Transition From Stage to Screen,"""Orphans"" is an ambitious film and certainly an interesting one but I can only give it a marginal recommendation. It's theme of loneliness and desperation is apparent but the power of the message is somewhat dilluted. What redeems the film is the terrific performances by Matthew Modine, Kevin Anderson, and the great Albert Finney. One scene does stand out, though. It involves the hot-headed Modine relating an encounter on the bus with a black man. Finney's reaction to Modine's retelling is pure poetry. I recommend this film to adventurous viewers because there is enough here that warrants a divergence of opinion."
3,funny,I really liked this movie the first time I saw it almost 20 years ago and I wanted to watch it again. I didn't like it as much. I guess my tastes have changed. I could only get it used on vhs but that wasn't the problem.
4,"What a thought provoking, heartfelt, funny story...","I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will recommend it! If you're a daughter, have a daughter, have a mother or a grandmother...I believe you'll relate to these characters. I saw myself and my mother many times throughtout the book and laughed out loud at the similarities.As with The Saving Graces, each chapter is one of the characters voice and point of view; this can get a bit confusing but overall I enjoyed it. I liked getting three different point of views, opinions, and set of feelings.I recommend this book, whether you've read The Saving Graces or not. I say, let Circle of Three have its own glory and quit comparing it to TSG. They are both very good on their own!"
3,lost interest,"This started as a very good book, yet when I got near the end it kind of lost it's appeal and I couldn't wait to be done with it. I will try others of her books, even though I wasn't totally pleased with this one."
2,Whiny teenager drives me nuts,"It is good to know that fifteen-year-old Ruth's mother and grandmother love her because I found her one of the most selfish, judgemental, and whiny kids I have ever met in literature. Carrie, the main character, gripes that her mother controls her, but her daughter is really in control. So what if her mom sleeps with her old heartthrob almost a year after her husband dies? How can this possibly affect Ruth except to remove her as the center of her mother's attention? And the reader, ""Goooodddd!"" I was a high school English teacher and I really don't think teenagers talk like this anymore. I will struggle through to the end of the audio version of this book only because I paid for it. I usually pass my audio books on to friends but I think this will go directly to the used book store. A really unpleasant listen."
4,Worth the Read,"I, like so many others, read The Saving Graces and was thrilled to see another book by Gaffney. It's not QUITE as good, but nevertheless a very enjoyable read -- better than a lot of books I've read! A quick read, enjoyable, heartwarming, funny and at times a little tense. I will definately recommend this to friends."
2,"Stick to Romance Novels---- This was no ""Saving Graces""","I enjoyed Saving Graces so much, that I couldn't wait to read Circle of Three. I was so disappointed. It was plain boring. I probably will not read another book by this author."
2,Disappointed :(,"I read The Saving Graces [TSG] and was hooked. I couldn't put it down. The characters were so real and well developed - I laughed and cried. I found out about Circle of Three and couldn't wait till it made it to paperback so I could suggest it for our book club. Unfortunately, after reading it I did not feel the same. It never really took off and the characters were flat. I kept thinking it would get better but sadly it did not. It was an OK book but if I had read it first I would not have read TSG thinking that it was average as well. I was very impressed with the writing in TSG and will give Gaffney another try in hopes that her next book will be better. If you haven't read TSG you should, it is 5 stars!!"
2,"Loved her first book, hated this one!","I really enjoyed her first book, ""The Saving Graces"" and I couldn't wait to read this one. What happened here?! This book was boring, and that's being kind. The chracters were flat and predictable, and I really did not care what happend to any of them. This was a big disappointment after reading such a fun, touching story in her first novel. Hope she tries again and gets it right."
1,Disappointing,"After having read and loved ""The Saving Graces,"" I thought I would enjoy this novel as well. Unfortunately, I found the plot to be thin and excruciatingly slow and none of the characters to be likeable. What a disappointment after the sparkling characters in ""The Saving Graces."" I won't give up on Patricia Gaffney yet, but I hope her next book is better."
1,Clever Marketing...empty promise,"JJ Moore was right on, connecting this book to ""The Da Vinci Code."" It sure seems like the Delos dude has a clever knack for timing, what with today being St. Patrick's day and all. But of course, I'm sure Delos wasn't trying to market this book at all. Probably wants to give it away free. I guarantee BookSurge publishing wants to make some money on it. Maybe by riding in during Holy Season and then sneaking out again later, or gaining profile right before ""Da Vinci"" hits the big screen, ""Delos"" is hoping for a best-seller. How crafty, pal, but clever marketing alone is not enough to lift a book to best seller title. You gotta have the right ingredients, and this book is just all ""sound and fury, signifiying nothing."""
1,Absolute Waist of Time,"Who ever Andrew C. Delos actually is, he/she has nothing to say. This is without a doubt the most poignant example of sloopy scholarship. Actually there isn't any scholarship to be seen."
1,"2 Corinthians 11:2-4, 12-15","2I feel a divine jealousy for you, for I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. 3But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ. 4For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough.""12And what I do I will continue to do, in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do. 13For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ. 14And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 15So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds."""
2,Very Thin,I was expecting a Fleece blanket like the ones you see in the stores Soft and cuddly. What I got was nothing like that it is very thin and stiff. Made off 100% polyester.
3,Not as Good as the UPDATED 2008 version,I seen the 2008 version on tv and purchased this one thinking this was it BUT it's from 2003. They basically remade this one (same director) and improved it imo so would definately recomend getting the newer one and it's also titled 'The Highwaymen' and has a black cover and is from 2008. I'd give 3 to 3.5 stars to this one and 4 to 5 stars to the newer improved version.
5,The Highwaymen,This was a fantastic story documenting black artist in Florida entertwining the civil rights movement with these artist struggle to survive by selling the Art out of the trunk of their cars.Now that european americans have exploited their craftmanship the value of the art they produced is demanding serious money. Too bad their heirs can't benefit from the skill that these artist produced.
3,Smaller than I thought,"My father really enjoyed this clock for his new pool-room, but the clock was smaller and more plastic looking than I had thought it would be. It sort of looked like something I could have made, as the balls were tiny and cheap looking. Dad really enjoyed it, but I thought it would look a little classier."
5,WONDERFUL LADY. A ANGEL FROM ABOVE,WHAT A WONDERFUL BOOK. EVERYONE SHOULD READ IT. MAYBE WE COULD CHANGE THE WORLD IF EVERYONE FOLLOWED HER IDEAS.
1,How are they not being sued for copyright infringement?,"This whole film appears to be footage from The Watchers and The Watchers 2! How are they not being sued? The audio is so bad, you can plainly tell they recorded the footage while watching it on TV from a video cam, and then just relabeled it as their own! I think I may have to get in touch with The Watchers series producers and have these guys taken off the market."
4,Exceptional Resource,"The Reality UFO Series offers a wealth of information through lectures and interviews, for those who want some real depth and nitty gritty on the subject of UFO's, abduction ect. The production is not polished or glossy, but the series is exceptionally informative, and made for the true enthusiast on the subject."

1,Sticky Situation,"I made duct tape wallets with my youth group. we got the idea from this book. The directions were hard to follow and by the time we finally figured it out, we had a very sticky situation. the tape stuck to everything. No one had fun. I heard some people say that this book is easy to understand, well, it's not. The directions say things like rip into three strips. Then place one strip sideways and sticky side up. Then put another strip upside down ontop of the stip with the other one. it may sound easy, but once you read all the direstions, it is hard. the pictures aren't much help either."
5,Great for those crafty kids!!,"Duct Tape is cheap..and it's available in a wide array of colors now too.My daughter got this book from us for Christmas, along with about 5 rolls of tape that I bought separately.She LOVES this book. It has about 25 different crafts...including clothing, glasses, and hats you can make from tape.Great fun! She spent several hours making things."
5,SOUFUL PEACE,"What in the world is going on??? American Idol 03 has come and gone. The winner has been determined and both he and Clay have a wonderful career ahead of them. The competition between Ruben & Clay is OVER!!! The reason why the two of them were the last two is because they were the two BEST. Votes determined that, not them!!! Stop hating on these two wonderful talents. They were both made to sing songs that showed their diversity (during the competition). However, Amazon is not holding the competion again. Now, both singers are able to share their own soul & style within their own genre. Who in the world said that Ruben did not enjoy or even like Rap??? Perhaps this CD displays Ruben's SOUL not American IDOL SOUL?? Thank the Lord that both Ruben and Clay get along....the fans should do the same. Blessings to both and much success"
3,I need to hear the next CD,"After listening to Ruben's debut CD, my thought was ""I can't wait to hear his sophomore CD."" I'm a big Ruben fan from the American Idol where he sang more classic songs and made them his own. I simply did not like the ""I'm still from the streets"" feel of the album. I felt as if the album was not meant for me. I wanted to hear a more mature Ruben who knew where he came from and did not feel the need to telegraph that information to me on practically every song. I was expecting the successor to Luther's throne, the velvet teddy bear. Instead, I felt alienated by the ""keeping it real"" lyrics. Yet and still, I still think he has a great voice so I'll give him a second chance. I hope he gets one."
1,Not impressed!!!,Lackluster performance by the American Idol winner. No showcase for his mellow voice at all. The song choices were in a different genre than I thought they would be. His voice was bland and uninspired.
1,This is Horrible,"Sorry I voted for Ruben. This is awful. The only halfway decent songs are covers, how can you mend a broken heart and superstar. What happened? Sorry you can't give a vote with no stars!!!"
1,Is this record a joke?,"From 80,000 contestants, they got this!? I'm amazed by this competition. Now it becomes a joke. This CD is just painful to listen to. His performace on TV is even worse. He can barely move while he's singing. I hope the stage would not collapse due to his weight. If this is what America wants, I'm not surprised why we still keep eating garbage from McDonald even though we know it's junk! Ruben might get bigger now because the money he gains from this record would get him more and more buffets."
1,TERRRIBLE RUBEN -- BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Awful cd, slow boring songs, then hip-hop crap! This sucks!"
2,Awful,I think Ruben needs to do something. I am not so sure it is be a singer. He won American Idol but what has happened to this man. If he was good enough to win this competition his music should be a lot better.
5,NOW CAN SOMEONE GIVE HIM HIS CROWN,I took long enough but it paid off.I think it is a perfect blend on hip hop and r&b.I just wish he would get his Crown that he deserve.
3,Not a bad start,"Let me start off by saying that I liked this album. I'm a huge R&B fan and this album is definitely part of that genre. I didn't really care for the done over songs like ""How can you Mend a Broken Heart"". It was hot when Al Green sung it, so let's just leave it at that. Its time for hip hop/r&b to get back to originality. Also for those of you who dogged this album but praised Clay, news flash: CLAY DID NOT WIN THE COMPETITION. Can Clay sing? Yes. But the last time I checked, the critics reviews for his album were very mediocre. Give credit where it's due and lets see past color for once America."
5,Ruben is for adults,"What can a say? When was the last time that you could put on an entire CD and romance your significant other? Now that all my Luther Vandross CD's are scratch, Ruben has moved in.Ruben has a voice meant for the older generation when singers could ""sang"" without the help of a studio. He has the vocal smoothness of Teddy Pentagrass, Luther Vandross, O'Jays, Gerald Levert, DeAngelo blended. Ruben has the old school voice--one that most haven't heard in years. Ruben can hold his own...a voice that can stand the test of old time. Not everyone call do a remake of the song and make it feel like you are listening to the orginal and remanisce of the your ""younger days"". I was captivated by How Can You Mend A Broken Heart, Superstar, Flying without wings."
3,Ruben,"Everyone knows who Ruben Studdard is so there shouldn't be an introduction. Ruben can sing a lil sumthin sumthin and on choice songs he RESEMBLES Johnny Gill. The lyrics and songwriting are just aight; not very powerful. That makes some of the songs seem like they drag on (For All We Know). But he gets down on songs like Sorry 2004, After The Candles Burn, Superstar, and Flying Without Wings that definitely show his vocal power. He gets down with Jazze Pha on Play Our Song and Swizz Beats comes through on Don't Quit On Me. The album falls flat on songs like Take The Shot, What Is Sexy, and Can I Get Your Attention but the good far outweigh the bad. Overall Ruben drops a formidable debut album; there's room for improvement. Fans of the show or Ruben should definitely checc out his first effort as a solo artist. 3.5 stars."
2,"listenable, but rather repetitive and displeasing","The songs sound very similar, they are all screaming. This CD is not good at all, 2 stars because i would only give a 1 star review if the CD was ear screeching bad. It's almost like I have every song on repeat, his voice is so boring. This nails the fact that he should've lost to Clay Aiken."
2,I AGREE WITH ALABAMA!!,ALABAMA GOT IT RIGHT! I DON'T LIKE THIS ALBUM AND FOR THE SAME REASONS.CALL ME A RUBEN HATER I DON'T CARE. I THINK RUBEN NEEDS TO RETHINK THE DIRECTION HE'S GOING WITH HIS MUSIC. AFTER READING SOME OF THE REVIEW HERE I'M SURE I'LL NEVER BUY ANOTHER ALBUM OF RUBEN STUDDARD. I THOUGHT THE AMERICAN IDOL CONTEST WAS OVER. RUBEN WON SO WHY ARE YOU PEOPLE SO MAD AT MR.AIKEN.IF YOUR SO SURE RUBEN IS DOING GREAT THAN WHY DO YOU KEEP ATTACKING EVERYBODY. SOUNDS TO ME THAT YOU'RE NOT SO SURE. WONDER WHY?
1,it's REALLY bad,I'm going to keep this review short so I don't waste your or my time. It's REALLY bad and that's all you need to know. It's very SLOW and BORING. Save your money and DON'T buy this CD.
2,I'm a little disappointed,I was waiting for this CD but I don't care for hip hop and even the ballads are too slow. Didn't enjoy it very much.
1,Repetitious and Bland Hip Hop,"I had high hopes for Ruben's CD. I thought that Ruben's CD would mirror more of what we loved from his American Idol run. This CD didn't provide the songs that he is capable of singing. Outkast provided a top notch hiphop cd that makes Ruben look like a wannabe. If Ruben would have stayed with the Luther type songs and created ORIGIONAL music, I would have been more impressed. I only hope that his next attempt isn't as bland and repetious as this attempt."
2,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I ORDERED 6 OF THEM FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS AND PICKED ONE UP FOR MYSELF THIS MORNING AT WALMART. I RUSHED HOME SO EXCITED TO LISTEN TO IT AND WAS HEART BROKEN. I EXPECTED TO HEAR THAT WONDERFUL VOICE I GREW TO LOVE ON AMERICAN IDOL AND IT WAS FAR FROM IT. ALL I HEARD ON THIS ALUM WAS 2 DECENT SOUNDING SONGS. THE REST IS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. WHY RUBEN THINKS HE HAS TO TURN INTO A RAPPER OR HIP HOT STAR IS BEYOND ME. I DID NOT VOTE FOR A RAPPER NOR A HIP HOP ARTIST. I FEEL IN LOVE WITH A MAN THAT COULD GIVE YOU CHILLS WITH THAT BALLARD SINGING VOICE. IF HE WANTS TO SING HIP HOP SONGS HE NEEDS TO REALIZE HE DOES NOT HAVE THE VOICE NOR THE TALENT TO KEEP UP WITH THE COMPETITION OUT THERE RIGHT NOW AND HE IS GOING TO TAKE A FAST RIDE DOWN HILL QUICK. RUBEN IF YOU READ THIS I WANT YOU TO KNOW I WISH YOU ALL THE LUCK IN THE WORLD HONEY, BUT I THINK YOU ARE LOSING A LOT OF FANS WITH THIS ALBUM. I AM SAD TO SAY THAT I WILL HAVE TO CALL AND CANCEL MY ORDER WITH THAT ONLINE MUSIC STORE."
2,The New Ruben,"I had wished Ruben had kept the style that won him the American Idol. That is why the people love him. Smooth, soft but powerful. I was not impressed by some of the songs. I have mixed feeling about the CD over all. I hope Ruben has more say in the next project. I look forward to his next CD."
2,Not a great start to a career,"Hmm, now that I've listened to all of Soulful 4 times over, I must say that I am not very impressed. The majority of the songs are lyrically banal and sometimes offensive (telling us how great you are Ruben seems just a little self serving to me!). The beats are monotonous and sometimes just so darned SLOW that it's hard to keep interest up. And worst of all, Ruben's voice often sounds high and thin, and on more than a few occasions, somewhat off key!If you're looking for a great truly SOULFUL CD, I would recommend either of Alicia Key's albums instead of Ruben's attempt. Better luck next time, Ruben!"
3,"Ruben is just ""ok""","I like Ruben's voice a lot but I do have to say that some songs just aren't that great, he also seems to sound just a little bit cocky and Im sure that the people behind his cd are responsible for that, you know how they do it, they say jump, you say how high right? well, there are a lot of songs I love, and there are lot of songs I dislike, so I personally have to give it an avg rating.. can't wait for Ruben to put out another cd or his Christmas cd. Looking forward to hearing something new..."
2,Don't Bother,"Typical gimicky jumble of songs. ""Guest"" artists used to boost appeal, but they can't rescue a boring, ""soul-less"" effort.Rueben is NOT another Luther."
3,Rating this as a debut album,"I listened to this album and it was not what I expected. First albums are defining albums for new performers, nor should they be. In this case we have an artist who is dropped on the music scene with sudden expectations and extreme fan groups cheering and jeering.I do not believe Mr. Studdard has found his voice yet. His gospel song is probably the best on the album in my opinion. Second is the ballads, although they could be song with a little less melisma. I don't think there is the right sound for the hip hop pieces so those pieces do not interest me.I think you should listen to the samples before buying, tastes differ and everyones opinion is their own. There are clips on Netscape and AOL, there are no clips on Amazon as this is written. Just realize there is an assortment of music on this CD and you should get a sample and not assume all songs are the same."
5,Soulful is WONDERFUL and DIVERSE!!!!,"Ruben's long awaited album is absolutely wonderful. I am so glad that Ruben decided to follow his own heart and style. The different styles mixed with his smooth voice puts him on the superstar level of Luther Vandross, Samm Cooke and the like.It is obvious to the practiced ear, Ruben placed his heart and soul into his debut CD. His professionalism shines through. I can't understand some of the ""hate"" on this web site when it comes to him branching out instead of the same cookie cutter songs as other artists. . . . .Oh. . . .maybe I can understand it - CERTAIN people are sore loosers. My advice is ""Let it go!"" You will live a lot longer with love for all. Give the winners of American Idol a pat on the back for the job performed. Remember, YOU didn't make it and I doubt if any of us writing to this colum could perform half as well as Mr. Studdard.Keep going Ruben. . . .you are supported by the majority because you are a STAR!!!!"
1,What the heck was he thinking?,"Many of the reviewers are rabidly defending Rueben's choice of songs and styles on this album, ranting that we, the American record buying public, don't have the right to expect pop music on this record. Helloooooo!!! The American Idol series started in Britain as ""Pop Idol"". If he had no interest in singing pop and smooth R&B, he should not have tried out for the show. What if Kelly would have put out an album of nothing but Broadway Show tunes, or Clay would have recorded his first album as Country? Fans would be disappointed and we have the right to be disappointed about Rueben. He should stick to pop and R&B and leave that rap cr@p at the curb where it belongs. I had high hopes for this album, but my copy has already gone to the Salvation Army. Don't expect his high sales to last very long once word gets out."
1,Very Weak and Terribly disappointing,"This cd was a huge disappointment. It would have been a decent cd if it came from someone else, but from Ruben, it's not good. It doesn't fit the ""Soulful"" title that it's given. At times, it seems like hip hop is forced into the songs. I guess I was expecting this cd to take me back to the days when R&B actually had content. But this cd lacked content and was quite immature. There is a verse in one of his songs that mentions something to the effect of ""It turns me on when you curse me out"". If that's how he really feels then perhaps the title of his album should be changed to IGNORANT. This album is lucky that it got 1 star. There wasn't an option for 0 or a half of a star."
2,Disappointing Debut CD,"OK, I love Ruben Studdard's voice... the guy is gifted, however, most of this album is just so-so. Best cuts are ""Sorry 2004"" and the cover tunes (""How Can you Mend a Broken Heart"" and ""Superstar""). My problem with this album is that I'm not a great fan of hip hop and many of the new tracks fall into that category. I know Ruben is trying to find his own way, which is wonderful, however, I think he might have been better served by doing more of a pop album as his debut. Don't want to be unfair and say that he should be recreating his American Idol performances... every artist deserves to grow... but would have been nice to have a CD filled with Ruben's beautiful vocals. This CD just doesn't 'represent' his talent."
2,Deniece Sanders review....,"You decide that people here need to ""grow up""? You say that blacks not whites are making this a race issue? I failed to notice any poster stating their race. And your comment about Clay, saying ""when did he start liking women""? You assume a lot regarding an issue about which you *know nothing. Don't listen to unfounded rumors and do some growing up yourself. Everyone has his or her opinion about Ruben and Clays singing. It's just that, an opinion."
1,Soulful by Ruben Studdard,This album was a disappointment. I really liked Ruben but hemisrepresented his musical style on American Idol. This modernR & B all sounds the same. I just spent 14.00 on a album Iwill never listen to again.
2,Sorry is right....,"Let me start out by saying i LOVED Ruben during American Idol and couldn't wait for his album to come out. Ruben's voice is amazing, but the lyrics of his songs are laughable. I'm Sorry for 2004 is an example of just a horrible song. I was really looking forward to hearing more songs like Flying Without Wings, which Ruben sings beautifully. I hope Ruben puts out another album that portrays the Ruben we all know and love from the show."
1,congressman dave,"I will not purchase this CD based SOULY on the samples provided on Amazon. This sounds just like any other R&B record put out, large bass lines and over produced. The background beats and sounds are much better than Ruben's voice. This album would be better served being re-released as an instrumental. Ruben clearly is not a hip-hop/urban/r&b singer, I agree with most of the other reviews....he would be better served to release some sort of gospel album. This may have been what Ruben wanted, who knows but I will say this....his 2nd album will not see the light of day. Ruben, you should have lost AI. I would vote anyday for Clay, just on shear vocal range and talent. You sound like every other R&B artist out and you also went the route of all other Urban artists....heavy in bling bling, sex, etc. This is a hurting debut album. I only gave it 1 star because ZERO is not an option!"
1,I don't know what the whole buzz is about,"soulful??? even britney spears(and she's so...fake and worthless and such a piece of crap) is more soulful than this....I don't know why people make such a big deal of this talentless singer, he has no talent! I still have no idea how he won AI, there where such great talents on the show and they give the record to the worse one! He has no voice, and now he's making a mix of R&B with Hip-Hop???? pls stop! I'll kill myself, you don't have to put this awful music, I prefer listenning to justin guarini(and he has zero talent also)pls go back home, and leave the field free for real singers, there's no time for wanna be's"
1,Terribly disappointed.,"I like Ruben. I really do. I was just terribly disappointed in the choice of songs. The only song on the whole CD I liked was his great single, ""Flying Without Wings"". I hope next time the writers give more than their ""B"" songs to him...a practice that is, unfortunately, common to do with new artists. These, it seems, weren't even ""B"" songs...more like ""C""s and ""D""s. Sorry big guy, you deserved better. A pitiful waste of time and talent."
3,Not Really AI Standard Material,"Sorry Ruben, you sing well, but this CD is pretty generic and forgettable. I haven't heard any songs from this album in the popular stations that play pop and/or r&b music. I bought this CD in hopes that it would live up to the name ""Soulful"". It's good to listen to once in a while, but not something I want to listen to over and over again. I'm a big fan of r&b and a fan of artists like Boyz II Men, New Edition, R. Kelly, Az Yet, and the Motown Sound, just to name a few. This album is inferior to those r&b greats. I thought he sounded really smooth in AI2, but he doesn't sound as good in this debut CD. I don't want to compare, but Clay's CD is much better and I've listened to Clay's CD numerous times, probably just under Michael Jackson's CDs and I'm a huge MJ fan. If there is a second time for Ruben, I hope that his true potential will shine. This album is just average, and Clay's album is excellent."
3,"Ruben, you had bad advice!","I agree wholeheartedly with another review ---- you were sold out by bad advice. Trying to appeal to everybody, you lost so much appeal and fan base. You have a gorgeous voice and talent to be more a crooner -- Superstar is gorgeous, stick to that style. Forget the rap -- it doesn't become you. Good music never hurt Luther or Nat King Cole ---- more good music, please.A fan"
1,Talent wasted...,"Please, Ruben! Don't waste your voice on trashy lyrics and join the throng of disgusting rappers. Oh, too late."
1,This guy should stop eating and take a singing lesson.,"I'm sorry for everyone out there who actually spent their money on this CD. I'm amazed that Roben even made it to the top ten on American Idol. I think that the only people that voted for him were fat people that thought Ruben was like one of their family members. Personally I think he is a disgrace to the pop music industry. In conclusion, the only reason I give this CD one star is because I can't give a zero star."
4,Great album for R&B soul lovers,"This album was worth the wait. It proves why so many of us voted for him. It's smooth, contemporary yet old school at times. Plenty of 'baby making' music for all those Luhter, Al Green, Barry White, etc lovers. I'm gonna recommend this CD to my family and friends.Good job Ruben on taking your time and making a quality cd."
3,Not that bad.,"I absolutely hate R&B or Hip Hop, one is too boring and the other too noisy and Yes, I am a Clay Aiken fan but Ruben's CD is not as bad as I was expecting.I would NEVER buy it for myself though 'cause I would only listen to it once and waste my money but his efforts are not bad.Of course, AI2 fans should've known that he wasn't gonna stick to ballads only where else is he gonna get the HONEYS and the MONEY but in rap or what he thinks is rap (lyrics need to be less stupid there BIG guy). People, HE WANTS MONEY AND FAME not your love and well wishes just plain cold MONEY.Yes, the lyrics ARE crap and it all sounds like if you have heard it all before (especially that TAKE THE SHOT song that awfully reminds me of that TEARS FOR FEARS song SHOUT)But HEY at least he's trying..i'm sure his fans adore his BIGGNESS!"
2,velvet voice - poor choice of material,Ruben Studdard's rich warm voice is wasted on the material included in this CD. Next CD needs better material for Mr. Studdard to be around for the long hall.
1,This cd proves that Ruben didn't deserve to win.,"We can't blame him for this crap. Blame those who voted for him! Everyone knows that under normal circumstances, this guy would never be a record artist because he's too ugly and also doesn't sing better than any other singers out there. The show has made him a star. To those who voted for him, put up with this record then!"
1,NASTY!!!! GARBAGE!!!,Album is garbage. Sounds like fat guy about to have a heart attack. About as soulful as the sound of toilet flush.
1,Walking Heart Attack,"Man, this guy really needs to lay off the wings! I bet his blood pressure is through the roof (not to mention his cholesterol, sugar, etc) He won the American Idol competition (which automatically makes him an industry joke) and follows in the footsteps of the Queen of Uncool, herself Kelly Whatsherface. This CD is a bomb and is already falling down the charts, too bad it is not the pounds. Don't expect Reuben to be around much longer. Either his contract will be cancelled or he'll suffer a stroke."
2,Just listen before buying,"This cd is okay, nothing outstanding, just like his voice, average nothing phenomenal here. Sorry but just like his single, Flying without wings, most of the songs seem to linger on making you want to switch tracks before the end of each song. Just my honest opinion but this cd is not one you will want to keep listening to. Two stars, its not bad, just nothing special."
5,I love the cd!,Ruben great job on your first album! My favorite song is After the candles burn! I can't stop listening to this song. This album proves why you are America's Idol!
2,Not a good album,Expected more from the winner of American Idol. He is not living up to what I think he is capable of.
4,"Not what I expected, but very versified","I was expecting a totally R&B album with all slow songs for Ruben's debut. I was pleasantly surprised at the outcome. I actually love the CD now. When I first heard it some of the up beat songs weren't my favorites, but as I listen more they grew on me. I know that a lot of his songs where there because of producers wishes, when Ruben has more room to grow he will definetely shine. I would recommend this album if you are a R&B fan. Not everyone is, I'm beginning to see that."
1,What happened?,"I loved Ruben in American Idol but I feel totally let down by this album. I wish I new he was going to change so drastically before I bought it. I didn't like any of the songs on the CD, and why all of the other singers? why not just Ruben. I can't recommend this album it's not very good."
2,Not what I expected,"This cd has a lot of hip-hop & rap tracks with a few of the songs like the ones Ruben sang on American Idol that made him the winner. If, like me, you are expecting more of the songs like Ruben sang on American Idol, you will be disappointed. Soulful, as a title is misleading. It should be more Hip-hop and rap from Ruben."
2,NO RUBEN!!!,WELL HERE GOES....I WISH THAT I COULD GIVE THIS ALBUM A GOOD REVIEW BUT I CAN'T. YOU SEE I THOUGHT RUBEN WOULD SING SONGS THAT BEST FIT HIS VOICE. I THINK THAT HE CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. I HAVE FRIENDS WHO THINK ITS OK AND WILL CONTINUE TO LISTEN TO HIS CD. AS FOR ME...ITS NOT WHAT I LIKE. I HOPE RUBEN WILL DO BETTER NEXT TIME. I HAVEN'T COUNTED HIM OUT YET. I LIKE RUBEN AND I LIKED HEARING HIS AWESOME VOICE. I JUST WISH HE WOULD SING SONGS ALONG THE LINE OF WHAT HE SANG ON IDOL. THAT TYPE OF MUSIC WAS WHY HE WON. BUT AS FOR NOW..... NO MORE RUBEN!!!
3,Well I just dont know ..... Mediocre....,"Well I was hearing this cd... I give him that he has talent his voice is not a joke when it comes down to that. What I do not like about this cd is the creativity and lack of substance. He basically doesn't really have anything to talk about(Sorry 2004) to other songs that just didn't make any sense to me. I heard better, he just need better things to talk about than taking the shot and other mess. If you a fan of the show, you would like the cd, but to me it wasn't what I expected."
2,THIS IS DAMAGED GOODS:,"How on earth did CLIVE DAVIS,let this happen.Ruben's voice is not made for hip-hop music.I am soooo disappointed in this cd until,I feel that it was done on purpose.There are only two good songs on this cd and that's track-1 Sorry 2004 and track-14 We have not forgot.Other than those two songs this CD is WORTHLESS!!Ruben deserves much better songs than the songs on this cd.Ruben has a beautiful voice,but on this cd it sounds like he has lost his touch and or his talent...He sounds average."
1,No Way,I got this CD and was offended..........this was the American Idol..........a big NO. This CD is awful! A waste of my money. I should have figured it out when he sang on AI3. I'm sorry 2004!
1,Soulless,"Dreadful, simply dreadful. Instead of this mish mash try Ludacris or Luther Vandross but this mixture of Ruben's supposed hip hop is silly. And he can't sing R&B that well either--so go for Luther--now he's got soul. And Ruben being nominated for a grammy in the same category as Luther---what a laugh, what has this world come to when they put such an amateur in the same category as an icon."
1,SLOOOOOOOOOW songs then HIP-HOP??????????????,What the heck? This is horrid! I mean Rubens album is a total DISAPPOINTMENT! Slow songs then hip-hop songs! I can't believe these songs are even on the same album! Makes no sense to me! I DO NOT recommend!
1,Listen to the CD before buying it,"I was able to listen to this CD before buying it and I was glad that I did because the CD overall was not memorable. I think the problem, at least for me, is that the songs are too slow and lifeless. His soothing voice that is admired by others often lulls me to sleep because he sings with almost no emotion and energy. I suggest for those who are interested in buying this CD to listen to it first before making a decision."
2,I was disappointed :-(,"I do like Ruben's voice, but there are sooo many hip-hop singers out there. The songs are nothing but average. I do like ""How do you mend a broken heart"". It's different than most of the others. I can not recommend this CD."
3,What's goin' man?,"What is going on? What happened? This is an awful collection of songs that does nothing for Ruben's talent.It is ""soul"" full of crappy songs that don't sit well with his style and strength. He is Barry White not Emennen, for goodness sake. The ballads found here are so slow in tempo that it gets depressing. The only saving grace are the songs from the AI2 performances. We need more of the same.Well, better luck next time Ruben. We know you are capable of much better."
4,HATERS!,All of these reviews above are a bunch of crap. Don't hate just because he won. I love the CD. He's got such a great voice.
1,dissappointing,This cd didn't measure up to Rubens talent. The look Ruben has with the hat and all does not lead one to think this is his kind of music. I have heard Ruben sing many songs and this cd is not Ruben. Looking at the cover on the cd makes me think of the old Mississippi River Boat days. I would love to hear Ruben sing something that makes our hearts melt.
4,This kid has soul- plain and simple,"i'm sorry but anyone who didn't like this album obviously can not appreciate real R&B. Forget the fact that Ruben is black and all that non sense. So what if his album wasn't as popular to the public as Clay's. He stuck to what he is good at, further Ruben stuck to what works, that is being from the heart. Throught the competetion he did not have to involve like Clay, Ruben was himself and that reflects in his music. Take the song What if, all be it it is a little short and could be prolonged a little more. But this song is just so Ginuwine, and that's what makes it sound good. Just in that song you can tell that Ruben is doing what he likes. To me, that song was the best on the album because he is really. He doesn't concentrate on showing off a voice that already stands out, on this album Ruben just sings plain and simple. So if u can't appreciate this album, u are probably not a true fan of Ruben and rather u were a fan of everything the media tried to make him."
5,THE BEST CD EVER!!!!,This CD is great! I have not bought any CD's in a long time and I ran out to buy this. I love every song on this CD and that's hard to find these days. This makes for a great Xmas present! I would defintley recommened this to anyone.
3,Unexpected and a bit disappointing,"I have to say that I love Ruben's rich voice. That man can sing!! I'm not crazy about the song selection on Soulful, though. Sorry 2004? I'm sorry, too! And, although he does a respectable job on Flying Without Wings, I really don't care for that song. I absolutely love his rendition of How Can You Mend a Broken Heart, though. He nailed that one, and he is superb on Superstar."
3,Where's the music we voted for?,"Although I agree that the album has some good music, it was not at all the album I was waiting for. I was waiting for the album you could put on and set the mood for a velvet teddy bear night. The hip hop just ruins it for me. I hope to see Ruben showcase his masterful voice in the manner he auditioned...hip hop is not the medium for his voice."
1,A few good songs but overall BORING,"I was a fan of Ruben on AI2, and bought and love the single Flying without wings. That is the best track on this album. The other good ones are For all we Know and Superstar. Thats IT. The rest are laughable, since when is Ruben from the hood? How many times can he sing about his crib & big boys? Stick to singing the ballads Ruben, you are no hip hop artist."
3,not as good as Clay's album,"to tell you the truth, this cd isn't that good at all. i expected more from ruben. right when i heard his first single from the album, ""sorry 2004"" i thought it was another one of those corny r&b singer, but after i found out that it was singing by ruben, i was shocked. what a waste of his talent. what happened to ""fly without wings"" like songs? instead he decided to go URBAN. what a load of crap.btw, my whole family (even my cousin) voted for ruben studdard, so no ruben haters crap."
1,I want a refund,"I like the Rubester, but it's just not the type of music that he sang on AI. Some of the songs don't even sound like his voice. Stick to YOUR music, RS. That way, your fans won't be disappointed.Warning: listen to it before you buy it so you know what you're getting beforehand."
1,Did Not Deliver,I am disappointed in American Idol Ruben Studdards new album. It did not capture the mellow voice from the show and drifted too far into hip hop. His voice seemed choppy and lackluster. I felt this was a very uninspired album -he certainly could have done better.
1,What happened to Ruben?,"I am so disappointed in Ruben's cd, it doesn't sound like him at all, and what is with the rap? I can't believe I bought this, in the trash it goes."
1,Just Not Getting This,I was given Ruben's CD as a Christmas gift by a friend who knew I was a fan. What happened to him? There is not one cut on this CD I can listen to all the way through.I'm very disappointed.
3,Does not capture his potential,"Sure Ruben has a soulful voice, and has over come a lot to make this album. But I'd have to agree that a lot of the album sounds too typical. Perhaps it has to do with pressures from the studio. Yes there are good new songs, ""For all we know"", ""Play our song"" and ""After the candles burn"" but the album does little to showcase his personality. The lyrics are reflective of songs we've heard before. And I want so much more for Ruben. Perhaps he will show more originality and creativity on his next record."
2,"horrible, just horrible","not only is this cd bad, but it totally ruins ruben's image. don't get me wrong, on the show, i loved ruben, voted for him everyweek. but if this cd was the first i would have heard of him, i would probably throw up. ruben's got a great voice but isn't shown on this cd. based on this cd, ruben appears to be a sex addict. ""what if i had to use the pay phone just to get my game on, would you still want to put it on me"" and ""what is sexy"" what kind of crap is this ""What is Sexy"" that sounds like something beyonce would sing, not an amazing singer like ruben. the highlights of this cd, ""Sorry 2004"" and ""Flying Without Wings"" two good songs on the cd, two stars for ""soulful""ruben- your next cd better be a good one, or i'm throwing your music in the trash"
3,Love Ruben Hate the album,"I thought we would be getting the same smooth sound that was heard on AI but that is not to be. I understand Ruben is locked into getting sales but I'm not sure this is the way to go. His fans want to hear more of what we heard on the show. Still, he has to find his way and the album, while not to my taste, may be enjoyed by someone else. Musical tastes differ so perhaps if you enjoy hip hop style you will enjoy this. On the slow numbers Ruben Rules!!!!"
1,Is this what I waited so long for?,"I waited anxiously for this CD and to say I was dissapointed is an understatement. Where are the soulful songs as suggested by the album title. I didn't realize we were voting for yet another hip-hop artist. I was looking forward to at least one or two new soulful songs, not covers or remakes, something he could call his own. The only new songs are the hip-hop ones and the only one of those that has a good beat is ""What is sexy"", though the words make no sense to me, the beat is catchy. The rest of them sound all the same and make no sense either.With all the backup on these songs, you dont even here Ruben singing most of the time. WOW, I can't believe he thinks this is good music. I wont buy another album unless I hear the songs first after this experience. For all of you who like hip-hop, you will like it I guess, but for those who don't, wait til his next album."
4,This is a true winner of American Idol,I have to agree when i read another person review and it said that Ruben was an AMERICAN idol and not a Pop Idol. He just didnt release an album that was written to apply and appeal to the masses. He took his time to be original and made an album that screams RUBEN. It was a well done first CD. I commend him on sticking to who he is!!!! The album was a true test to Ruben's abilities to sing not only ballads but all R&B music with a little Hip/Hop flava. Well done Ruben!!!
2,So-So,I expected more. Ruben's sound seems to have changed some since the early performances on AI. However I really like him and perhaps his next CD will he will have more experience and be more consistant.
1,Not what I expected,As a fan of AI I was disappointed. I thought Ruuuuben would cover Sweet Home Alabama! I thought he would do more songs like Flying.. I am not a fan of today's music and to me this CD is today's music. Ruuuben did great with Tamyra Gray on the Christmas CD. Do more with her! Sing in that register. This voice is the voice I can't like.
4,A good step,"A great start for the big guy, At first i was hesitant to buy the cd because of the reviews it got from the people here, but when i looked into Billboard and E reviews(in which it was rated pretty well)that prompted me to buy the album. IT wasn't a disappointment at all. Being in AI and a recording artist is really different, in AI you render a version of a song based on the genre of that week, as a recording artist you get the chance to sing your kind of songs. This album just disproves anybody who says he cant sing other music other than soul. Overall if ur into today's music your gonna like this one.."
1,PLEASE LISTEN FOR YOURSELF BEFORE YOU BUY THIS CD,I must say I bought this on a whim. I played snippets of each song and gave it to my nephew. He really doesn't care for it either. It was a waste of money.
5,Ruben Studdard #1,"This CD is the greatest. The whole album is crazy. Ruben Studdard is the best R&B singer so far for me. Every song is great. There's songs you can bump to, and songs you can make love to. It's just a great album."
1,AWFUL,"AWFUL, DREADFUL, TERRIBLE, APPALLING, DIRE, UNPLEASANT, BAD, POOR, HORRENDOUS, INEXCUSABLE, ATROCIOUS, ABYSMAL, HORRIFYING, SICKENING, UPSETTING, UNSPEAKABLE, DISGUSTING, ATROCIOUS, FRIGHTFUL, BRUTAL, VILE, HIDEOUS, GHASTLY, OUTRAGEOUS! DON'T BUY IT!!!!"
1,Expected more from Ruben,"If you like a mixture of hiphop & R&B, then this is for you. I expected more of an R&B flavor for Ruben's debut. Only three or four songs worth listening to. Hoping for better with the next CD."
4,this cd is nice tooo me but tooo each it own,i think everyone is putttin ruben cd down for no reson i think its nice it suprised me!! it hink they could have promoted him more!!! he is a very talanted brother! i love his soulfoul melody he is smoooth!!! i love you rubben! hold your head up sweetness!!
5,"Ruben, RUBEN, RUBEN!!!!!","I absolutely love this CD. I'm soooooo proud of him. I haven't taken it out of my CD player yet. My whole household love, and we have different taste in music. This is why is the American Idol winner. The man can SANG!!!!!! So. please give him the props he deserve. Every hit on this CD is all that. WHat is Sexy and What IF, We have not Forgotten,No Ruben,Take the shot, Sorry 2004, and of course Superstar, and Flying without wings are my favorite. And as you can see that's most of the CD.THe Velvet Teddy Bear Lover."
5,Truly Something to be Proud of:),"Ruben did not let his fans down at all with this beautiful album. He had something in there for everyone and that is what music is about, fans. Although I think it's crazy for people to think you have to pick one or the other, I think that all four of the American Idol soulo cd's were great in their own way. I loved Ruben, Clay, Kelly & Justin and think they have all made us proud. Way to go Ruben! Follow your heart and it will lead you right!"
1,"Overproduced, Adolescent Lyrics, Amateur Dreck...........","Admittedly, this is the guy's first CD, but give me a break! He sounds like some guy who bought studio time to make a CD for his mother. But wait! Nobody's mother would want to hear these lyrics that equate love with sex, brag about money, bling bling and winning contests. What a turn off. Not something my children will hear before the age of 18! The guy sings FLAT-that must be why they overproduced it-trying to drown out the flatness and gasping for breath. He's an amateur, an imitator, karaoke king! He might be OK at weddings-for free. This kind of ""music"" is the exact reason that CD sales are down. It sounds identical to all the other garbage out there today! Glad I didn't waste any money on this junk-I downloaded it. Don't worry-I'm not sharing it-I wouldn't want anyone to know that I had it on my hard drive!"
5,"Too much ""East Coast, West Coast"" stuff on the site","Must I remind this is reviews on ""Soulful"" you either liked it, or not. If you liked it tell us why and if you didn't tell us why. This is not a site to bash Ruben or Clay. I am a black 20 year old male from Raliegh, North Carolina. So I like both Ruben and Clay. So lets drop the rivary (because Clay and Ruben really do not care about that rivary and are best friends.)And plus to me ""Soulful"" and ""Measure of a Man"" is on the same level to me. My faviorite song on here is the song Ruben does with Fred Hammond because I am a huge gospel fan. Pick this CD up it is awesome."
2,Where is Ruben's voice??,"My only question is who is singing on this album? He sounds just like the other 800 guys on the radio. This is a tragedy as Ruben has a beautiful voice. He is singing out of his comfort range and it shows. I think both Ruben and Clay have been done a disservice by their ""handlers."" More of the same is not what we need from two truly talented young men. No racism, no clayism, this album just doesn't do Ruben justice. I am hopeful that he will find his voice next time. It is a debut album, given time and better material, Ruben could become a legend. The quality of this album, however, will not get him there.To steal a phrase from Simon, ""dreadful."""
1,"YAWN, YAWN, AND DOUBLE YAWN!","If you're suffering from insomnia, then this is the album for you! Just put it in your CD player, and within minutes you'll be in deep sleep. Ruben is an allright singer, nowhere near great. While he was competing on the show American Idol, Ruben Studdard chose ""safe"" songs to sing, and remained in a one-dimensional singing zone throughout the length of the competition. This album is no different than his one-dimensional performances on the show. On this album he shows his lack of range and sounds raspy in nearly all of the songs. It's clear that Ruben's ""win"" on American Idol was merely a ploy to make R&B music appeal to the masses. Sorry my dears, but this album sucks. I want my $14.00 back!"
2,Save your money,"I was soooooooo disappointed in this effort by Ruben. Where is the Ruben we all truly liked on AI? He is selling out his huge potential R&B audience by bringing in other artists on the CD, catering to ""urban"" radio and forgetting there are many of us that loved his smooth ""Luther"" appeal. I love music, and enjoy many artists. If hiphop is well done, as OutKast, then it is enjoyable. Sadly Ruben misses the mark here. Listen to song samples before buying. By song 2 I was bored, turned it off and gave it away. Sorry Ruben fans, he needs to do more here."
1,Slow and tedious,"Superstar is so slow and tedious that you can hardly wait for him to stop groaning his way through it. Elsewhere in the album, Ruben takes too many breaths in the wrong places. And the faster songs are just as tedious due to the monotonous melodies and uninspiring lyrics. No, Ruben, this album will not make you a star."
2,Soul--what?,"I really don't like the lyrics to some of these songs. Like, ""But the cribs and the cars and the jewels, I'm gonna keep so I can floss with my boys on the weekends."" in ""What Is Sexy"" and ""You know I love you like I used to love cake"" in ""What If"". One song even starts out with ""Ladies and gentlemen, this is a Jazzy Fizzle produshizzle"". I think some people voted for Ruben because they were sick of the ""Bling"" and the ""-izzles"" and wanted something different. There's enough hip hop around, how 'bout some NEW soulful R&B; songs?By the way, every popular artist has tons of hate-filled reviews no matter how good or not good they are. I don't know why some ""reviewers"" seem to think that Ruben's bad reviews are just because he beat someone else in a singing competition."
2,GIVE ME A BREAK!!!!,RUBEN HATERS.. RUBEN HATERS.. RUBEN HATERS..GIVE ME A BREAK! THE WRITINGS ON THE WALL FOLKS AND ITS NOT VERY GOOD..ITS NOT CLAY AIKEN ON THIS CD SO STOP BLAMING HIM. ITS NOT ABOUT RUBENS RACE OR WEIGHT EITHER. I THINK RUBEN HAS A BEAUTIFL VOICE BUT THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO GO. WHEN HE SANG ..I COULD SHOW YOU THE WORLD HE SOUNDED AWESOME. REMEMBER WHEN HE SANG THE BEE GEES SONGS? HOW COULD YOU NOT LOVE HIS BEAUTIFUL VOICE. I KNOW THAT RUBEN HAS IT IN HIM.. IF HE WANTS MY MONEY HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE ME HIS BEST. THIS CD IS FULL OF MUSIC THAT IS SUITED FOR SOMEONE ELSE. IN ONE OF THE REVIEWS SOMEONE SAID THEY FELT CHEATED...WELL SO DO I.
3,Average,"Ruben has a pleasant voice and a pleasant sound but this CD is best described, in my opinion, as average. There is nothing outstanding in any way and I would not be inclined to listen to this on a regular basis. Not bad, but not remarkable."
2,WHAT HAPPENED ???,WOW! I MEAN WOW!!! THIS ISN'T GOOD. WHAT HAPPENED? I LOVED HEARING RUBENS SING ON AMERICAN IDOL BUT THIS IS NOT GOOD AT ALL. I LIKE HIP HOP AND BLUES BUT THIS IS NOT YOUR FORTE' MAN. YOU NEED TO DO WHAT YOU DO BEST. WOULD LOVE TO HERE YOU DO A GOSPEL CD. MAN>>YOU ARE NOT DOING WHAT YOU DO BEST. LUTHER SINGS WHAT SHOWS HIS VOICE IN THE BEST LIGHT DUDE. YOU NEED TO RETHINK THIS. SORRY BUT I DON'T LIKE THIS AT ALL.
1,Can't get into it!,"I wanted so much to like thiscd, but I just can't get into it. He seems to have trouble breathing or something. I want the AM2 back!"
1,Worst album ever,It's shocking how awful this album is. I mean it's downright horrid. I wish I was Simon so I could come up with some witty way of describing how truly horrible this album is. I liked Ruben on American Idol. I thought he deserved to win. But if he had been singing songs like this I would have wanted him gone before he even made the final 12. I mean the songs are just terrible!!! And I wish he'd do something about his weight because he is extremely unhealthy.
5,A Soulful Variety of Ruben,"I think this CD was a great way to let the world know just how talented Ruben Studdard is. This CD can be enjoyed by both young and old. Beside, there is no CD in the World that you will like every cut on it.I am not caught up in the battle between the two vocalist. Both are extremely talented, but we have to recognize that each of these guys have their own audience and because it is not your favorite type of music or style doesn't make the CD bad. Let's be positive when we write a review. Ruben sounds great with whatever he sings. He and Clay proved that on the show. Again, because it is NOT YOUR FLAVA doesn't mean it has a BAD TASTE! Be positive, support both of them and kill the caos!"
1,PREVIOUS REVIEW,"NO, NORTHNORTH, RUBEN IS NOT THE ""BOMB"". HIS CD ACTUALLY ""BOMBED""! THE WORST CD OF THE YEAR IF NOT OF ALL TIMES."
3,COME ON PEOPLE KNOCK IT OFF,"I can't write a full review 'cause I only listened to Sorry 2004 and even though it's not the Ruben I saw on American Idol I thought it was very well done. I saw him perform it at the Macy's parade and he looked so happy singing it. It was a good song and from what I've heard from his fans they love it too. That being said, I'm a Claymate, a die hard Clay fan and I am desperatly begging every other Clay fan to stop posting negative reviews of Ruben's CD here. If you listened to the CD and didn't like it that's one thing but to come here and post bad reviews just to denegrate his Amazon rating that's not right. Yes, some did it to Clay but two wrongs don't make a right. Leave it alone and let Ruben fans enjoy this CD without having to read some of the awful things I've read."
1,what a disappointment!,"my gosh, this cd is a total waste of my hard earned dollars, and i want a REFUND! shame on ruben, and it was ruben who held up the record BECAUSE he wanted to do stupid 'hippity-hoppity' music w/ the names all mispelled, lol! (got that from the trailer for the new tom hanks movie, the old black lady says it) but it is very apropos for this tripe. it is a case of 'bait and switch' and false representation for mr. studdard to do that, after hooking everyone to vote for him by portraying himself as the NEW luther vandross or something, and then after winning the recording contract, boom. he should have at LEAST waited until after he released 1 or 2 discs w/ songs like the show, and THEN gradually moved into rap and hip hop! he just DOESN'T care about the R&B; fans who voted him the winner, AT ALL!show him you don't like this, by NOT buying into this scam! don't buy this 'sorry' recording, i wish i hadn't!"
1,"Ruben, Ruben.....I've Been Thinking","Wow!!...Couldn't wait to buy this!!!....got it home, listened to the whole thing with great expectations....and OMG....WTF???....So nice to hear Ruben's voice...but THE TUNES ARE UHHHHHH....REALLY REALLY BAD....If Ruben put out a CD of nothing but his American Idol performances, that would have been the best and most heartfelt product he could have given his fans!!!!...this AWFUL CD pales in comparison 100% to his AI performances!!"
2,A good singer who disappoints in this cd,"I've heard Ruben do much better. Although I didn't watch AI2, i heard clips from the show and I know Ruben can do a much better job than this. On this cd, his voice is a little too plain and doesn't show anything special at all. However, this may be because that I am not a fan of R&B...so you can call it a bias if you would like. Overall, the songs are boring and fail to portray his special flare. Songs that are ok are ""For all we know"" and ""Flying without Wings""...i think only these songs redeem the cd"
1,What a sucky CD!!!!,Ruben this sucks! What happened? Voted for you on AI2 and you put out this crap!!
5,"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT","This is a wonderful CD...This Velvet Teddy-Bear is extremely soothing, and warm. I am very glad that I bought this CD, and I am sure will enjoy it for years to come...his voice, style, and choice of lyrics is refreshing and timeless. I didn't doubt that he could hold his own. I LOVE YOU RUBEN.Anyone who doesn't enjoy this doesn't know what GOOD MUSIC is."
5,This Boy GOT IT!!!!,"I bought his album and I simply love it to death...Ruben can sing and thats all to it! I so hope one day he will do a duet with Whitney Houston. I think their voice would be awesome together...Also, If you havent bought Whitney Houston's first ever christmas album ""One Wish"" you should definately check it out its hot just like Ruben!"
5,Way to go Ruben,"While I choose not to get into the by now childish debate over who should have been the AI winner, I must say that Ruben has certainly blown the cover off his talent with this wonderful cd. This young man has such depth and power to his voice. While he may not be so popular with the pop culture, he most definitely is one of the most soulful singers of this millenium. I was tired of the over synthesized voices of today. Ruben is simply ""refreshing""."
2,Ehh,"Ruben is to Boyz 2 Men what Clay is to the Backstreet Boys. If your into the whole soul kind of thing then you might like this, but I've heard 2 of the singles from this and I think their pretty bad... He's still better than Clay Aiken though, he just didn't get the best material to sing..."
5,"Yes, you are a dummy","First of all, as a music writer who has written for major magazines I can tell you that most critics pull their opinions about out of the air. How many are trained musicians? Not one that I have ever met. In my opinion, and I have written many, many reviews, a Rolling Stone review is no more valid than the average joe on the street's 2 cents.Secondly, most albums decline in weekly sales after initial release, that isn't a credible indicator of an album's quality.Before you make blanket statements about issues you seem not to understand, I highly suggest educating yourself, dummy."
3,chaos princess,"Now comparing him to Luther Vandross and Barry White, are u crazy that is like comparing beer to champagne. I think is style of music appeals to acertain group of people that are particulary into soul, as where Clarkson was more of a pop sensation, I doubt that will be toppped. CLAY you were ripped off."
1,ABSOLUTE GGAARRBBAAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is trash!! A huge pile of trash with moldy bread and dirty diaria dipers!! Ruben can't sing!! He is absolutly pathetic ,this album is THE WORST I have ever heard since I came to America!! Ruben needs to work on his music instead of gorging himself with CAKE, GRITS, HAM SANDWICHES ,AND PORK & BEANS!!! Rubin is a no talent lardo, and this album needs to stop being sold because it is so BAD!!! IT IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!!!!!!!"
2,I'm sorry I bought this CD 2004,"I do not mean to offend anyone but this CD is awful! His 2nd CD was better, but not much!"
2,"Ruben Studdard, ""Soulful""","I agree with all of the other 3-star and below reviews. A star on the mic on ""AI"", but a disappointment on this album. How do you market this? It was too ""black"" for pop audiences and too corny for urban audiences. Cheesy songwriting and weak production made matters worse. Fantasia won this year's ""Idol"" so that probably means it's the end for Ruben unless there's a ""From Clay to Ruben"" movie in the works."
4,"Different......Not what I expected, but I liked it.","I admit I was hoping for more of a lounge singer type CD,easy listening stuff, and this surprized me a lot. More upbeat, mild hip hop, sort of groving and dancing stuff. Kind of grew on me though after listening for a while even though I am not a big hip hop fan.. Like the sexy song track and his take on the bee gees song how can you mend a broken heart. Bottomline, you cannot compare this to Clays CD because they are really targeted to different buyers and fan base and they each take different music paths. They are both talented. Wish people would not get into this trashing Ruben or Clay stuff...so stupid. They are good friends why can't their fans be friends too and support each others success."
2,I HAVE IT FROM VERY GOOD SOURCES THAT...,"I have it from very good sources that ALL the songs chosen for this CD were RUBENs decision...with the exception of superstar and flying without wings which were included for sales purposes.The J records didn't agree that easily but since Hip hop and Rap are so big right now and a big part of their income they decided to allowed Ruben's wishes.Also, from very good sources, Ruben has always wanted to be a rapper not a choir boy that is why SORRY 2004 is one of his favorites songs AND he gets ""GIFTS"" for wearing ""hip hop"" clothing wich was expected to sell more if he's cd went platinum.What do I think of the CD...not much...everything sounds the same and the lyrics are quite dumb... I really hope he likes he's choices because I sure don't.Please TRY AGAIN!"
2,Borrrrrrrrrring!!!!,"I'm sorry I bought this cd. Ruben is as boring on this CD as his performances were on AI. He has no range and always sounds like his straining just to try and get through the song. Sorry, Ruben."
3,Not what I expected but..,"The ballads on ""Soulful"" are well done, enjoyable.. Ruben's voice does not shine on the uptempo numbers. ""Sorry 2004"" was the perfect first single, it has a cool contemporary feel to it and Ruben's vocals are great. ""For All We Know"", ""Sorry 2004"", ""After The Candles Burn"" and ""Superstar"" are the best songs on the album. It's not what I was expecting from Ruben but it's not bad.. it will hopefuly grow on me with time."
2,Not recommendable!,This CD get's boring towards the end. The words gets repeated over and over. There is only a small part of this song that was good the rest are pretty much boring.It is not something I would recommend to everyone!
3,Flip side,"I long for the days of the old record album. Then I would wish that this album were split in two with all of Ruben's wonderful, smooth love songs on one side and all the rest of his stuff on the other side. Then I would only play the love song side and never flip it over. I don't like any of his rap-type music. Teddy bears don't sing like that."
1,He should have staye a Luther wannabe,"On the strength of his Luther Vandross/Carpenters cover, I bought this cd. I played it, and wondered, who this guy was? This is not the singer we voted for on AI. His style is tottally NOT him. He should have stuck to being a Urban AC singer, instead of vying to become another unknown. This cd does not distinguish him at all. I will most likely sell mine on ebay, for cheap."
1,"Suddard must have ""won"" AI like Bush was ""elected"" president","There's no other way to explain it. Based on sheer talent and effort, Kim Locke deserved to win, with Clay as the runner-up.At its best, Studdard's voice is appallingly mediocre, at its worse, painfully flat and strained. His best performance was his initial audition for the show - it's been all downhill from there, including this dismal album. The songs on Aiken's album may have been bad, but at least Clay can sing...a misguided but undeniably talented Christina to Ruben's inexplicable and atrocious Britney.If you loved Ruben during the show, you might like the album, and probably have it already. Good for you. Different strokes and all that. But otherwise...yuck."
1,TERRIBLE,"I am very disappointed with Rubens cd, and why so many covers, why duets? Slow and dragged out songs, then you get hip hop songs in there too!!!!!!!!!! AWFUL!"
1,Exactly why Ruben never excited me,"Just listening to a few seconds of each track (well, not Flying Without Wings - I couldn't tolerate even a few seconds of that again) bored me to no end. Yes, Ruben has a smooth voice, but after a few minutes, everything sounds alike. It's too smooth; there's no passion here. When slow songs and rap and R&B and gospel all sound the same, there's a serious problem.For me, this is a complete dud."
1,Pitiful.....,"I was looking forward to Ruben's release. I am disappointed with what I've heard. Ruben has a great singing voice, but it's wasted on this hip-hop, with a few ballads thrown in, mess of an album.This album isn't ""soulful"", it' pitiful.....I rate this NO STARS...."
1,please......NO RUBEN!!!,"YES, if the sales of this album are low the only one Ruben can blame is Ruben himself. Ruben wanted to sing RAP and HIP HOP. He didn't want to be a choir boy but a rapper! Yep, as funny as it sounds he says he can handle DA HOOD!Also, from very good sources, J records didn't want him to record rap/hip hop UNTIL his 2nd album and the only reason slow ballads were included in this one are purely for sale purposes the only 100% decision of the producers but even that took a great deal of arguing with Ruben.As for the album, IS NOT WORTH BUYING, not even ON SALE 'cause eventually is going to end up at a thrift store anyway. The lyrics are just plain DUMB. We know he's no player or a thug. RUBEN GIVE IT UP ... YOU ARE A MAMA'S BOY."
1,"Ruben, WHAT HAPPENED!!!????",This album is awful! Rolling Stone Magazine gave Rubens cd a 1 out of 5 stars! Seriously! It is true! TERRIBLE
1,"Not the ""Idol"" you're expecting","Overall, I am completely dissatisfied with this album. I think that Ruben had some solid performances on American Idol, but this CD in no way reflects the ""Idol"" that American voted. Ruben won the competition by singing Luther Vandross-type songs that suited his voice and personality. However, he completely changes genres on his album, i.e. rap duets with Fat Joe. Ruben has a good voice, but uses it in all the wrong ways. This album is not an accurate reflection of the ""American Idol"" America voted."
2,Very disappointed,"Oh my goodness, I'll be selling this one. It's nothing like I expected. Maybe 3 good tracks."
1,Not What I Expected,"Ruben has a great voice and should have stuck to the type of music he did on the show. He didn't sound like his heart was in it. There are a couple of good songs but for the most part this CD is not worth buying. Try it again Ruben and this time really put your ""Soul"" into it."
1,There's a reason why amazon won't let you sample the music,"This CD is boring, a true sleeper. Not only that, but Ruben's voice sounds strained in a lot of the songs. They should have put more effort into this one - unless he shows us something better soon, his career is sunk. Amazon wants you to buy it - that's why there are no song samples available to listen to before you buy."
2,"Love Ya Ruben, but 'Soulful' STINKS","I was a huge Idol fan, behind Ruben all the way. Couldn't understand why I was seeing Clay's CD everywhere, but no Ruben. Finally I found it! Boy, I wish I hadn't! This is the worst CD I've bought in years. It's a waste of his talent, with the exception of maybe 1-2 songs. Badly produced/mixed, Ruben sounds like he's off in the background somewhere, while the back-up singers come through loud and clear. The material is short on substance and long on cheap lyrics. Generally, a bunch of chatter. I sincerely hope Ruben will find some better material and go back to the song stylings he is so suited for, and which won American hearts on Idol. If you're expecting this CD to be filled with what you saw on the show, you'll be very disappointed. If you prefer choppy hip-hop to smooth R&B, you may like it."
1,AWFUL CD RUBEN,"What the heck happened! Why is there HIP HOP crap on this album? Slow dragged out songs, then Hip Hop stuff!!!???? I do not recomment at all! Sorry I voted for you!!!"
1,REVIEWING THE CDS??OR .......,I'M A RUBEN FAN!! I LOVE RUBENS VOICE AND I THINK HE IS VERY TALENTED. I BELIEVE THAT HE WAS GIVEN BAD ADVICE ON THIS CD.THAT IS ALSO WHAT I THINK HAPPENED TO JUSTIN.THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM DO NOT SHOWCASE HIS GREAT VOICE. I HAVE A BONE TO PICK WITH A FEW OF YOU WHO THINK THIS IS A VENUE TO VENT YOUR PERSONAL ATTACKS UPON THOSE WHO WE THINK ARE DIFFERENT OR JUST DONT AGREE WITH US. THAT IS NOT GOING TO HELP RUBEN AND'M SURE THAT IF HE WOULD READ SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THESE REVIEWS HE WOULD BE UPSET.RUBEN IS A GOOD MAN....AND WE ALL KNOW THAT....I'M A 66YEAR OLD GRANDMA AND I LIVE IN AL. I'M NOT TOO SWIFT ON THE COMPUTER BUT I'M TRYING..YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOW LONG IT TOOK ME TO WRITE THIS.I'D TELL YOU BUT IT'S PAST MY BEDTIME. GOD BLESS
2,What a disappointment,"Purchased the Reuben CD and must say I was SO disappointed. Only a few ballads on the CD.. The rest have a rap beat/sound to them. Although this guy can carry a tune, he didn't do it on his debut. Would not recommend."
1,Not the American Idol,"If you are expecting this album to sound like Ruben from American Idol,, it doesn't. He has completly reinvented himself.He doesn't look the same or sing the same. I thought this album was awful and unlike others who are using these reveiws to bash each other's choice for AI, I didn't vote for anyone. This album is awful, I bought all of the top four CD's from the Idol contestants and I have to honestly say Kelly and Clay's were the best. Ruben can't seem to even hold a note. Maybe the American population should acctually vote for someone who can sing rather than going for someone the judges call by pet names.Very diapointed in this and the voting."
2,The winner gives back to his fans (not),"Studdard has a marvelous voice, this cannot be denied. His voice captivates no matter what genre of music he chooses to sing. However, he runs the risk of alienating his American Idol fans with his hip hop/R&B flavoured Soulful. His fans voted for the Luther Vandross style Velvet Teddy Bear, and are given a cleaner version of a Fat Joe or Ja Rule album with Studdard's Soulful. That isn't to say the album doesn't have its standout tracks - Sorry 2004 is a fresh song concept and Flying Without Wings recalls the VTB's AI days. But two or three tracks catering to his original fanbase won't make Studdard a star. Here's hoping that Studdard's next album is more stirring soul and less dreary attempts at contemporary music."
2,Not what I expected.,"I purchased this CD this morning while Christmas shopping and really expected what I heard during the American Idol show but im so wrong, personally im not into hip-hop or rap so this really is not the CD for me. I do sort of like Sorry 2004, because its slow and smooth but Ruben tends to say ""Sorry"" tooooooo many times, im sick of ""Superstar"" and hate the lyrics to ""Don't Quit on Me""!!! Hey, if you like hip-hop this would be a decent CD to buy even though im not a good judge on hip-hop, but if you're looking for the man you heard on American Idol, I don't think you'll find him on this CD. This CD isn't ""Soulful"" to me."
1,Why did I vote for you?,"This cd is terrible! Sounds like you couldn't make up your mind on what to sing, so you sang some of this and some of that! Slow songs, hip-hop songs, even a gospel song, What the heck! SKIP button, TERRIBLE!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"DO NOT BUY this CD. Listen to the demos first, I'm sure glad I did and not waste my money. This is about as bad as Justin Guarini's."
3,"I liked the ballads, but wanted more R&B flavor","I loved the ballads on this album, but was really dissappointed that it had mostly Hip Hop. Ruben's voice is smooth and should'nt be wasted on that crap. Maybe next album will have more R&B flavored songs."
1,What Happened?,"I usually order my CD's online but was in a hurry to hear Rubens album after waiting so long so I was at the store first thing this morning to get my copy.I really liked Ruben on American Idol but was very disapointed In Soulful. I thought most of the songs were slow and boring. I kept wondering is this Ruben? It didn't really sound that much like him, I don't know what I expected but this wasn't it. I had planned on picking up a couple of more for Christmas but I think I will pass on this one.My advice if you can listen to it before you buy it do so."
2,Poor material for a great voice,"Ruben's debut album is very disappointing because of the poor musical quality of the original tracks. Most of the songs are poorly written and do not do Ruben justice. He has the potential to be the next Luther, but he needs writers to support his talent. This album just did not cut it."
3,I'm not really feelin' it. 3 stars.,"October 5th, 2010Ruben Studdard has a wondrous voice. I don't know where it is on this CD but it only comes out in pieces. And have you heard some of these tracks? They really try hard to be ghetto fabulous. Not feelin' it!There are some tolerable tracks though. 'Sorry 2004' is decent, although it was overplayed back in the day. 'Take A Shot' is OK, but nothing remarkable. As is 'Play Our Song'.The remakes here are nice, but none of them touch the originals.My favorite track is actually still 'Flying Without Wings'. I think that song almost made me cry before. It's so soaring. Besides 'FWW', 'After The Candles Burn' is probably my next favorite track.All in all,Soulfulis very hit and miss. Too many ghetto wannabe tracks here. More than I could tolerate. If you want to make it urban, actually make it worth listening to!3 stars or a 6/10.DOWNLOAD:'Flying Without Wings' &'After The Candles Burn'"
1,I'm Horrified at the Words,This CD should not be heard by children. I am horrified at some of the words. Ruben has such a great voice--he could have done so much better. Was the gospel song at the end to repent for the rest of the album?
1,LISTEN TO THE SAMPLES!!!! AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This will prove Rubens cd is AWFUL! Goes from slow dragged out songs to hip hop stuff! UGH! Terrible, I so do not recommend!! TERRIBLE!!!!"
2,"Ruben Soars, Then Bombs.....","Ruben Studdard, America's number one teddy bear icon. Ruben has a very good voice but the songs were badly picked. He attempts to sing older songs which make the album not appeal to the younger audiences. ""Don't Quit On Me"" is the absolute best song on his CD. I only listen to this CD for ""Sorry 2004"", ""Play Our Song"", and ""Don't Quit On Me"". The rest of the CD is crap. Save your money and do not buy this unless you are truely a fan of older R&B music."
2,"""Soulful"" Review","I loved both Ruben and Clay on American Idol for different reasons - and their voices and styles are so different that they really complimented each other. After hearing both cd's, I would recommend Clay's ""Measure of a Man"". I found so many of the songs on ""Soulful"" to be repetitive; that is to say, if I didn't know I was listening to a different song, I wouldn't know it was a different song! With the exception of a couple of songs on this cd, it's not that great. By comparison, with the exception of a couple of songs of Clay's cd, most are great. I realize everyone is different and prefers different styles of music even though I loved something about both 'idols'. But I'm sorry to say, at this time, I prefer Clay's cd. Looking forward to Ruben's next effort though!"
1,TERRIBLE CD!,"I bought this and do not like it at all. SLOW dragged out songs, then you get a hip hop rap type song! What is this a smorgasbord of awfulness! DO NOT BUY! What a total DISSAPOINTMENT!"
1,Not what I was expecting,"What can I say? This isn't quite what I expected. I was hoping for so much more. Many of the songs end up sounding the same, and none of them really stand out. If you know of anyone who has this cd, ask to borrow it first. That way you can listen for yourself before you spend your money."
2,A Cryin' Shame,"Ruben has such a terrific, no fantastic, voice so its such a shame they (his producers) came out with this as a debut album. This CD does not do him justice, what were they thinking?? I bought this CD very enthusiastically, I listened to it a few times hoping it would grow on me but sorry to say it didn't. I hope that the music industry learns what good ""real"" music is, not the produced stuff they try to cram down our throats. Sorry, Ruben, about your CD but you are still a winner in my book."
3,Hip Hop is not for Ruben,"Why did J records not steer Ruben towards Blues/Jazz direction. I hate Hip Hop and thought Ruben would not have been pidgeon holed that way. I do love the song ""For all we know"" w/Fred Hammond and ""How do you mend a broken heart"" is pretty good, but kinda slow. Most of everything else on the album is O.K., except for the Hip Hop crap. I do recommend Luther Vandross's album. It is fantastic."
5,Amazing,"I love the album...some of it is a bit over produced but his ballads are truly moving while his upbeat tunes have a cool rhythm. His incredible range, charm, and talent will afford him a long life in the industry. I can't wait for the next album!"
1,I voted for Ruben,"and this is NOT what I voted for. I wanted R&B and that smooth voice of his. What I got is more hip hop crap, and already hugely oversaturated market, and the producers electronically enhancing/changing Ruben's voice. What is with that? Ruben could do better but they didn't give him the chance and sadly it seems to have been his own choice to take his music in this direction. I'm enormously disappointed. I will not be buying any future CD's released by Ruben. I thought Ruben wanted to make a difference in the music world but he just wnats to be like everyone else and put out crap."
3,Expected More,"Ruben is a very talented young man. He tends to remain consistent on his performances on american idol, but this CD misrepresents him. He has so much more power in his voice. Don't get me wrong it is decent, but I just expected a more soulful and powerful voice. The lyrics to most of the songs doesn't even seem to fit Ruben's style of singing. I think I just expected more from him, I wanted to hear more of that voice that he has to give, and I don't think this CD shows his complete talents.But I am still a Velvet Teddy Bear fan, because I know he has what it takes."
2,HERE WE GO AGAIN!!!,I FEEL THAT WE WERE CHEATED.THE SONGS ON THIS CD ARE NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM RUBEN. RUBEN HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE....WHAT WAS HE THINKING WHEN HE PUT THIS CD TOGETHER? SUCH A BEAUTIFUL..WHAT A WASTE.IF THIS IS HIS BEST I WISH I HAD VOTED FOR SOMEONE ELSE. FOR ALL OF YOU WHO KEEP CALLING US RUBEN HATERS BECAUSE WE DONT LIKE THIS CD ...GROW UP! STOP MAKING EXCUSES..ITS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE FACT THAT THIS CD IS LACKING THE BEST OF RUBEN.. I KNOW RUBEN CAN DO BETTER ..DO YOU? IF YOU'RE WILLING TO EXCEPT THIS AS IS THEN YOU DON'T DESERVE BETTER. I WILL NOT BUY HIS NEXT CD UNLESS HE BRINGS US A CD THAT EQUALS WHAT I HEARD HIM DO ON AMER.IDOL. SO BE IT. A RUBEN HATER? NO. ASK YOURSELF THIS QUESTION? IF RUBEN SANG THESE SONGS ON AMER. IDOL WOULD HE WIN?
2,Not what I expected!,"I should have realized that the American Idol ballads were not going to be on this CD. I love the cover songs, but I am just not into hip/hop. I would love to see a little more of the old style R@B and less hip/hop. Sorry 2004 is okay, but does not live up to the Ruben of American Idol. No Ruben, I heard in concert and it was cute to watch him perform, but I don't care for Rap music. What Is Sexy, oh NO Ruben. I just can't imagine this being Ruben. I hope that in the future, Ruben's beautiful voice will be showcased and not covered up. He is an amazing performer, but this CD is a disappointment to me."
1,snore...makes me sleep,"So sorry, but I do not like this Cd. I listened to the whole cd once expecting to find at least a couple of good songs to listen to, but boy was I disappointed! Except for Flying without wings (which is just so-so), the rest of the songs are really wrong choices. I don't know but somehow the way they were sung made me want to sleep...so booooring. Maybe I was expecting too much from this American Idol, but honestly, I like Clay's album better. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this cd."
2,I Like Ruben But I Am Disappointed with His Debut Album,"I listened to Ruben's debut cd. I didn't like what I initially heard. I thought I should give it a chance and listen to the whole album, so I did. I am sorry but this cd doesn't sound like Ruben at all. The songs are a mixed of hip-hop, rap, and R&B and that is okay but the songs except for the ballads are more about noise than anything else.I like Ruben, I really do but I must say with all honestly, this album doesn't do justice to a talented performer."
3,review,PEOPLE keep the review about the cd - this is not a place for your personal opinion of who should have won a tv contest. That's over. The big money is now when these artists are up against everyone else. Leave the Clay/Ruben thing out of it. This cd is a good start to Ruben's career. It is not perfect; but it does have redeeming qualities. There are several songs worth repeated listening; how many cd's out there today have more that two? He is an artist that will improve with time. He definitely has a smooth voice and with the right lyrical choices next time I think he'll be a great addition to the r/b and music world.
4,Ruben Delivers,"I've been a fan of Ruben's ever since he made me cry on American Idol. It's a tough feat to make me cry just by singing. I saw the outpour of disapproval, and i have to rebut it.Of course this is CD has hip hop influences. His whole genre of music is now heavily influenced by hip hop. It doesn't necessarily make the cd bad. He still sings with the same soul as he did on the show, and certainly as well. The cd is personal, danceable, and I found it quite good. It'll stay in my CD player through winter, seeing as it's done a great job keeping me warm today."
4,"The best ""Soulful"" sound",I think that the album could have been better but he stills sounds wonderful. My favorite song on the album is After the candkes burn. For all the people that are putting him down because you don't like his album think about he's making more money than you.
1,eh?,"Ruben took 7 months to come up with THIS? Looks like he hooked up with the wrong folks and needs to get with some other dudes ASAP! He is lucky he got the politically correct votes and won the TV show title, but now he is going to be dethroned soon and will soon be forgotten for good, unless his little buddy Clay lets him keep riding his coattails!"
4,a good cd from a talented American Idol singer,"This CD has its ups and downs (more ups). Ruben has a great rich deep voice, and it matches nicely with the lyrics of his songs. Some of the songs are a bit lame, but I stress that only some of them are. Most of them are cool and have a good beat. I recommend this CD to anyone who liked listening to Ruben on American Idol."
4,Ruben is funky and definitely Soulful,"It's slammin'. Many of the tracks have that hip hop flair that was really missing from ""American Idol"". ""Sorry 2004"" starts things off right with vintage Ruben. ""No Ruben"" is a shout out to the fans and it works very well. It's catchy. I can see these first two tracks getting a lot of airplay. There's something for everyone in that ""Superstar"", ""For All We Know"" and ""How Can You Mend A Broken Heart"" are technically flawless ballads that cool you down between the thumping bass lines of tracks like ""What is Sexy"" feat. Fat Joe. That song is awesome. I think many will be surprised that Ruben kicks it so funky. Pleasantly surprised."
1,Rush job,"Like so many others I absolutely love Rubens' voice, but this release is so very dissapointing for an ""American Idol winner's debut cd. It's just too ""Ghetto"" and ""immature""."
1,AWFUL,Not the Ruben from American Idol. Very disappointed!!!! He was so out of breath that it sounded like the backup singers took over. NOT WORTH IT
1,Just plain boring,This CD is boring. Just waste of money.I was really disappointed with this album. The songs Ruben chooses to sing are nothing like the songs he sang when he was on American Idol.
1,Poor Ruben,"Poor Ruben,He tries so hard,but just can`t handle it.His singing is just to boring.He gives out before the song is over with."
3,Smooth velvety voice...excellent sound quality,"I thought his album was pretty good, but not what I expected. Two of the best songs on his album are ""For All We Know,"" and ""After The Candles Burn,"" which is a smooth, rich ballad.I'm not an R&B or hip-hop lover, so I was hoping for more ballads, like he sang on the show. I like both Clay and Ruben as musical artists. They are two completely different singers with different music genres, so hope the best for both!"
3,dissapointed,Couldn't wait to hear this artist that could be the next Luther Vandross but not with this material. Too many hip-hop selections that don't sound that polished. And is he trying to be like Kid Rock putting his name in so many songs? Let's hope his next album showcases his beautiful voice or he won't have that long of a career.
1,Too fat to be a pop singer!,You have to admit it. This dude is way too ugly to be an American idol. What's wrong with Simon Cowell and the other judges in the show? They have just destroyed music industry by picking this guy to be our idol. Ruben is a typical American trash who eats too much junk food and sings too lingeringly. I can't imagine who would be an American Idol next season. It's horrble!
5,something for everyone,"Ruben's CD ranks in the top 5 cds of the year, with his rich voice, and soulful sound. With people like Fred Hammod on the album this cd truly has something for everyone.This album is great"
1,Title of CD say's it all,I bought ruben's CD today. I bought clay's CD when it came out. I wish nothing but the best for ruben. but as simon would say.. It didn't blow me away. It's not any good. I wanted to be fair and buy both cd's so that I could be honest about this mess unlike the show was. Clay is so much better. Ruben will never sell as many cd's as clay has. It just will never happen.
3,Soulful but not quite satisfying,"Big Ruben.... You are on the right track, but not quite there. Most first albums are not and I do understand that you are being tugged in quite a few directions to do different things. Ruben has big shoes to fill after pulling off the unbelievable on American Idol. There is pressure to be the next Luther Vandross and Barry White, yet some want a ""safe"" and pop star. Maybe a few less cameos and more Soulful R&B would have made this the classic we were all expecting. I do hope the two tracks with R. Kelly and Missy that did not make the album will be released later as well as the Ja Rule joint. Overall its an okay album but I believe Ruben will bring the pain with his sophomore release. There are some joints that are off the chain, but then there are some that could have been left off. Don't let us down on the next album..."
1,Souless,"It is a bad day for music when your ears are horribly scarred by the absolutely TERRIBLE music eminating from the sample music box in the electronics section of a local store. However, this was the case with this CD, Soulful, by Ruben Studdard. The thing sounds like someone put the same mid-tempo sample behind Ruben as he sang each tune. How terrible is that! Not to mention, Ruben simply doesn't have the full capabilities of his voice at hand throughout this album. I think Ruben has some talent, but I think more energy was used in creating Clay Aiken's album....even though both of them are equally sad. Why are the American people so eager to act like a flock of headless sheep and listen to this tripe? Have we gotten to the place that we will accept anything (or anyone) the media thinks is ""good""? Granted, Mr. Studdard has some talent...but he needs to leave the American Idol thing behind...along with the rest of us."
2,Not Impressed,"Okay, so I admit that I bought both Clay's and Ruben's CDs, and it was NOT in order to compare them with each other. It was because I genuinely enjoyed listening to BOTH of them on American Idol and believed that their CDs would also be enjoyable. Well, I now can say that I still enjoy Clay's voice and his CD. It's lively and upbeat, but Ruben's is BLAH, and actually BORING! Yes, it's just my opinion, but for what it's worth, ""Soulful"" is just ""Soul-LESS""----and less, and less. Not worth the price of admission, folks, unless perhaps you buy it from the ""Used"" market for only half the original price---or ""LESS""!!!"
1,Boring and monotonous,"What in the world is this album? The songs all sound the same, and Ruben sounds tired. When I saw him on Letterman, he about put me to sleep with his boring song. Half of the songs you can't even understand what he's saying!! This is not the same Ruben that was on American Idol."
2,Depressing !!!!!!!!,"It's depressing to hear ""Sorry"" so many times in the song. I got bored in the middle and lost interest listening. Ruben may have a nice voice, but it gets boring towards the end as most of I just can't understand how Ruben got nominated for the grammy award! There are a lot more singers that deserve to be nominated."
2,Good but just not for me,"This album just doesn't do it for me. It sounds like one long song. If I wanted to listen to the same thing for that length of time , I would hit the repeat button. I like more variety on my albums. Ruben sounds great and did a good job. It's just a little too much ""mellow"" for me. I prefer some excitement mixed in. It's a great effort and I'm sure it will do well. It's just not for me. I hope on his next album, Ruben will step up the pace a little and add a few more upbeat songs. Good Luck to Ruben!!"
1,a long wait for a dissapointment,"I don't know if it was as long as it took for this album to be released, but I guess I expected more from the AI winner. Just more hip hop bla. This album has no guts"
2,2 stars for 2 songs i really like,"I am one of rubens biggest fans so needless to say I was not happy with just liking 2 of the songs on his CD. When a singer does a ""re-do"" of a song that has been very popular in the past, you have to at least do it better or what is the point.I am refering to ""How Can You Mend A Broken Heart"" for one. Unfortunately, ""Flying Without Wings"" is one of the 2 I still enjoy so much. I wish Ruben the best and hopefully his next CD will reach his potential."
1,TERRIBLE cd,"Slow dragged out songs, then you get hip hop rap stuff! What the heck! I DO NOT RECOMMEND! F"
1,Our American Idol (NOT),"If your not sure about buying this ""PLEASE THINK AGAIN"" In my opinion don't waste your money. If your a fan of Ruben's and you thought he did awesome in American Idol then you will like it. I'm a 100% Clay Aiken fan. Clay in my opinion is going to blow Ruben away. All I can say is Thank God they are friends. It's not worth fighting over. They both have talent. Good luck to you both."
1,IDOLS and child abusers should not mix !!,"So Ruben is the American IDOL? I don't think so ! An idol should be someone that folks (especially children) can look up to and admire. Instead we have Ruben selling out and collaborating with R. Kelly, the same R. Kelly who was video- taped sexually abusing a young girl. Is this who an IDOL should be associating with? I think not. I will not buy this CD, not because of Ruben, but because of his association with a child molester. I can not support anything that causes money to be placed into the hands of those who violate young girls."
2,a dime a dozen,"Voices like Mr Studdard's are a dime a dozen in the recording industry....there is truly nothing special about his debut CD. I might as well pick up Luther's album instead. In general, the songs all sound the same. I would expect more from this CD that was held back for so long so that it would be ""just right"". The wait is over my friends. Now, let's wait for a really good CD."
2,Disappointed,"I am a Ruben fan but this CD does not do justice to this man's talent. Too much hip-hop and not enough of the soulful ballads that compliment his voice.Not every cut is a disappointment. I did enjoy 'Sorry 2004' and 'How can you mend a Broken Heart'. These are the type of songs he needs to stick with. Ruben, I love you but you have to go for the mature listener rather than your peers."
3,A singer without words to sing,"This album is nothing like the amazing ballads he was given to sing on the show. Instead he was given mostly Hip Hop songs to sing, which made for an almost boring album. I really enjoyed the songs from the show like Ribbon in the sky, Smile, A whole new world, Kiss and say Goodbye, Flying without Wings and others. Only about two decent songs were on the album. I will be very glad when his American Idol contract expires so that we can hear more songs suitable for his rich voice rather than the targeted demographic his producers are trying to push him to."
5,Goooooood CD! Buy It!,This is a good CD! All the songs are good! Congratulations Ruben! Well Done! Stay Strong and true to yourself!
5,WHY RUBEN IS THE AMERICAN IDOL,"I HIGHLY recommend buying this cd. Ruben is showing America just why we chose him as our AMERICAN IDOL. His strong, yet soothing voice rings loudly on SOULFUL."
5,Reuben - a WINNER again !!,"I watched American Idol and thought that both Reuben and Clay were excellent. Reuben won the contest yet the media and thousands of Clay fans continue to push Clay as though he won. I was really hoping that Reuben would release an album that would be great - Well claynation and media HE DID. The albumspans the old and new. Pure classic R&B and Hip Hop. The Velvet Teddybear shows some claws in the hip hop tracks while his ballards reminds me of Luther. Clay's ""Invisible"" is so true in comparison with this American IDOL winner. His album (measure of a man) DOES NOT Measure UP."
1,What a shame,I liked Ruben more than Clay (although I thought both were very talented). Clay's CD blows Ruben's away. It sounded like Ruben needed to clear his throat all the time. He doesn't have the power or range that Clay has. This CD has made me a Clay fan.
4,Are we there yet?,"First, I am quite fed up with the constant ""hating"" on Ruben. He was a crowd favorite very early in the competition. While some of the material might be a little lacking, I have heard the same thing about some of Clay's material. What baffles me is that the only similarity btwn. Ruben and Clay was their debut on AI. Why are people so hung up on comparing the two artists? Yes, Ruben won. No, it was not by a small margin [Ryan mis-read the vote margin]. Yes, I agree that Clay can sing...but, this is as ridiculous as comparing Luther Vandross to Barry Manilow. Let each artist enjoy their success, and get over it.They're not even in the same genre of music.P.S. A lot of great artists have their roots in church, so get beyond the whole ""I'm tired of the gospel-y sound/attitudes"". There is nothing wrong with Gospel influence, or sharing said upbringing in one's performance. Ever heard of Elvis? Open your minds."
2,KING OF SOUL???,TONIGHT ON AMER.IDOL3 RUBEN SANG..HE STILL ISN'T AS GOOD AS HE WAS ON IDOL2. I THOUGHT MAYBE IF I SAW HIM PERFORM TONIGHT I MIGHT CHANGE MY MIND BUT..... NO.. I STILL DONT LIKE IT. AND BY THE WAY..WHY ARE YOU STILL BAD MOUTHING CLAY AIKEN?? HE DIDN'T MAKE THIS CD. RUBEN DID. IF YOU THINK THIS IS A GREAT CD THEN WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT CLAY AIKEN DOWN.. MAKES A PERSON WONDER. I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO RUBENS ALBUM AND RUSHED OUT TO GET IT. WHEN THE NEXT ONE COMES OUT...... I WILL PASS.
2,Don't Believe The Hype,"Whatever you do, don't go out and buy this cd for a good, original voice. He is an impersonator of the greats. He is probably a great wedding singer. The vocals are not that great. Studdard, surprisingly, is a mediocre singer. He would be great at weddings."
2,Totally Disappointed,I was disappointed when I heard some of the songs on this cd. Without Wings is the best song. I noticed on one of the reviews that if you like Luther Vandross you'll like this cd. I think not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If the producers of this cd would have really let his voice shine like on the song Without Wings then a definite yes. The material of songs does not fit his good voice. Maybe his next cd will be better. I will not be buying this cd.
2,Very Disappointed,I enjoyed hearing both Rubin & Clay on American Idol. After listening to Rubin's new CD I'm gonna stick w/Clay. Way too much Hip Hop. Real disappointment & not worth waisting your money on!
2,I hope you like hip-hop music,"Well, this CD is disappointing, to say the least. I really enjoyed Ruben's performances on American Idol, and was looking forward to this CD for months. Now that I have it, I find myself skipping half of the tracks.Sorry 2004 and How Can You Mend A Broken Heart are the best songs. No Ruben, What Is Sexy, and Can I Get Your Attention are simply awful. I feel cheated by this album."
1,Soulful........Not!,"I really enjoyed listening to Ruben on Idol, and was looking forward to his new release. What a disappointment. Sounds like R Kelly Studdard. RnB to the max. There was only one or two songs that were decent enough to keep the cd for, but it's not worth the money. It's albums like these that make illegal downloading continue to prosper."
2,BAD ADVICE TO A MAN WITH TALENT,SEEMS JUSTIN AND RUBIN KEEP SAYING I'M SORRY!!!!REMEMBER JUSTINS SONG??? I'M SORRY!! THE SONGS SOUND THE SAME.JUSTIN DIDN'T IMPRESS HIS FANS AND I'M SORRY BUT RUBEN IS GOING TO GO DOWN THE SAME...I LIKE RUBEN AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM DO WELL BUT HE SEEMS TO BE REPEATING JUSTINS MISTAKES. RUBEN AND JUSTIN HAVE GREAT VOICES BUT SEEM TO HAVE LOST THEIR WAY.RUBEN HAS PROVEN THAT THE TALENT IS THERE. HE WON THE CONTEST.I HOPE HE FINDS A WAY TO GET BACK ON COURSE.BY THE WAY PEOPLE THE AMERICAN IDOL CONTEST IS OVER.THESE YOUNG MENS CAREERS ARE BEFORE THEM.BASHING THEM IN THE MANNER OF INSULTS IS OF NO GOOD USE.SUPPORT THEM OR NOT.STOP THE NASTY INULTS OF THESE FINE YOUNG MEN.PERSONAL INSULTS ARE NOT WHAT IS EXPECTED WHEN GIVING REVIEWS.
2,Sad,"I never was a big Ruben fan, but let me say that I was unpleasently surprised with this album. I've only heard two songs on it, but that's enough for me.When I heard ""Sorry 2004"" me AND both my parents (My mom actually used to like Ruben) agreed that the song was boring, and I think it could've been written better.But the biggest turn-off for me was ""What Is Sexy"". I listened to a clip of that song and was in shock. If Ruben would produce a song like that now, think of what he might be singing later...I would not recommend this CD unless you're a die-hard Ruben Studdard fan who'd buy anything he came out with.P.S. Sorry if I offended any Ruben Studdard fans, but it's really a waste of time to type a review just to say that I'm wrong, so please don't do it."
2,The fat man has potential but...,"The music is pretty lame, his voice goes out of tune once in a while, and the lyrics. Just listen to ""Sorry 2004"" to see where i'm getting about the lyrics. Just download a few songs off this if you want and go buy a Killing Joke cd instead."
2,Not an American Idol!,First the voice on this CD sounds nothing like him. It's amazing what a recording studio can do to improve a not so perfect voice. There were only a couple of songs I thought were decent. The rest are hip hop crap. His voice is for ballads... he should stick with those for his next CD.
1,Not worth it,"The smoothness of Ruben's voice on American Idol is not even in the least, repeated on Soulful. His new style of singing is disappointing. For winning the AI title as being a Luther Vandross type sultry singer, he has a different style on Soulful such as singing duets with ""Fat Joe."" The duets with rappers were totally unexpected and very ill-received by me. He has lost almost all of his deep, loving voice we heard so much of on AI.I would not recommend this CD."
3,If You're In Search of True R&B Look Elsewhere,"Clearly taking advantage of the hype of American Idol, this album was rushed into production and the result is an uneven not quite satisfying CD. Not sure whether it's hip-hop, R&B, or Soul, it jarringly flitters from one sound to the next, with no sense of continuity. It tries to hard to be all things to all people and, in the process, does none of the genres any justice. For example, the re-make of Al Green's classic ""How do you Mend a Broken Heart"" is more pop than soul. Indeed, the Bee-Gees version is more evocative. ""Soulful"" is a listenable but, in the end, disappointing effort."
3,Good Start to Career,"Ruben...What!!! This album although entitled Soulful, is not laced with the soulful ballads and mid-tempo songs that I hoped it would be. Instead Ruben opted to go with the oversaturated hip hop/R & B music. I for one, think that Ruben could have done a lot better! Don't get me wrong, this is a decent debut. Ruben needs to stick with the Luther Vandross type of music!"
2,Disappointed- Lack of R&B,"I consider myself average in age (36) and pretty diverse when it comes to music. I loved Ruben's voice on American Idol, adored his R&B sound.I expected his Debut CD to showcase his voice as he did on American Idol. However, I was very disappointed as to the absence of the R&B on this CD and instead was replaced with Hip Hop. Had Ruben of done Hip Hop on American Idol, he wouldn't have gotten my votes.I wanted on his CD what I voted for on American Idol.I am sadly disappointed.Folks, if you think this CD will be songs similar to the ones Rue sung on American Idol....think again. There is Hip Hop/ Rap on it that may disappoint you- I hear no Velvet Teddy Bear. I do hear a Rapping Grizzly Bear, though!What a disappointment that he forgot us fans who voted for his Smooth R&B sound. He sold us out to the younger Hip Hop teens :-(Yes there are 2 R&B songs on the CD which are ""Flying Without Wings"" and ""Superstar"" but we've been hearing those for months...nothing new there!"
1,not impressed,"This album was a total waste of money- every song was identical and was totally boring- I do not think Ruben has any staying power whatsoever in the music industry- if he ever does release a second album it will do terrbily- just because he was the american idol does not guarntee good music, and just because you lose american idol doesn't mean there is no success- just look at Clay Aiken- he is totally what America needs right now and who really cares if Ruben shipped platinum because Clay is up to triple right now. Ruben may have won that battle but there is no way he will win the way in the music industry if he continues to put out garbage like this"
1,sorry,"I was hoping you would put this Clay stuff to rest, but not with this CD. Maybe next time, Ruben. It is (with the exception of the 2 sig. songs) slow. When you draw out notes you lose power. When you sing a song that has been a hit before you have to do it justice, you did not. I am taking it back and getting Outkast."
1,Not the Reuben we loved on Idol!,"When his CD was released, I went and bought it for a Christmas gift for my husband...both of us are fans. We are VERY disappointed. We had it on while playing cards thinking it would be nice ""background"" music to listen to...sort of mainstream, Luther V meets Barry White kind of stuff. But NOT. It's all over the place and very stylized. It's just not the velvet teddy bear we loved on idol. It's like he appealed to tons of fans on the show...then he went totally off the beaten path with his CD. I'm a Clay fan too, and I must say, Clay's CD is much more across-the-board appealing and fun to listen to. We haven't listened to Rueben again since."
2,Music Sampler,"I never watched American Idol, but it seems like I missed something. I borrowed this CD to listen to because I was curious about whether these guys were any good. I certainly couldn't buy it based on these reviews, which are obviously biased. If you like the winner, then you don't like this guy, and vice versa.The problem I have with this album is that it is all over the place--R&B, Hip-Hop, Gospel. Is this a sampler? Is he trying to find himself, or just trying to please everybody? In any case, the songs are just average, sometimes not even average. I don't understand the hype.I won't be buying this one. Don't feel bad fans. I won't be buying the other guy's either. Maybe their next albums will be more seasoned."
1,Not soulful...pitiful,This CD is the biggest waste of money ever. It just makes it more apparent that Ruben didn't win based on any musical merit.
1,Ruben Studdard fails to impress me.,"Ruben Studdard's debut album is the worst album from contestant in American Idol. His vocal ablity stands far below from Kelly's and Clay's. Sure he has a warm and souful voice, but a lot of the other finalist from AI did as well. I think the Idol winner should have a big voice that stands out and he does not. His album is one dimentional, all songs are R&B and nothing else. I doubt that he will have a long lasting career. Sure a lot of people bought his album but they did not know how it was going to be before they bought it. And I doubt they will buy his next album for it is only his personality and his calories and fat that carried him this far."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,THIS IS YET ANOTHER BORING R&B CD WHICH YOU FIND IN THE RECORD STORES. THERE IS NOTHING SPECIALON THIS CD SO I WONT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE. ONE STAR ONLY.
2,Clay should have one,"I'm sorry Ruben, you have a good voice, and a few good songs, but you're just not as good as Clay Aiken.I think they counted up the votes wrong or SOMETHING, because it seems like everyone is going against Ruben and more to Clay. Face it, he really is better. Especially if you compare this album to Measure of a Man from Clay Aiken.I could never imagine humming or singing one of the songs on this CD. Maybe this is just my opinion, but i'll know people are agreeing with me if i see 'yes this review helped me'."
1,Boring and non-musical,"I really wanted to like this CD but frankly I was shocked by how horrible it is. I have given it to my 9 year old who seems to be more the target audience. Drivel. Poorly sung. Lacking energy and frankly never to be listened to again. On the other hand, we have Clay who has certainly shown who the better singer is. And we have Ryan Malcolm who has put together a really terrific CD. Ruben, who I really wanted to see succeed will fade into obscurity before the end of 2004."
1,I am so Sorry!,"Another AI failure, please this whole cd was based on the concept of hip hop which it is but come on this man is no Luther Vandross. As much as he wants to be a Luther hes not. Typical singer you can find in any church. I do not recommend this cd."
1,Thanks for the headsup!,"After reading reviews I was weary of buying CD. NOW! you have listed samples to listen to in advance. I formed my opinion from sample list. I WILL NOT BUY CD! Did not like any of the songs. Love Ruben on AI2.... but, this is not the Ruben I remember. The voice that sounded like Luther is what sold america on Ruben...........What happened to that voice? Maybe next time."
1,Disappointed,"This is not what I expected from RUUUBEN!! I enjoyed his smooth R&B on American Idol but most of this album is a mish- mash of hip-hop and rap. With guys like Chingy, B2K and Outkast there, why would you buy this? I'll stick with the movers and shakers from now on. Sorry I bought it."
1,Disappointing,"very disappointed, to many deep breaths, sounds like ruben can't breath, also not the type of songs he sang on AI. He didn't stick with what he knows best."
1,Close your mouth!,"Why, oh why, does Ruben always have his mouth open in pictures. Is it because he is hungry, hoping a fly might land in there, or is he belting out music that sounds good but says nothing. My guess would be the latter. Maybe if he wrote his own songs, something that came from the heart, he would sound like he means it. On this album (ironically called Soulful) it is obvious that he hasn't had enough life experience to have a developed soul. Experience with the buffet at Sizzler doesn't count. To be a mucisian you first and formost must have something to say. Here, people try to put words in the big guys mouth but it comes off as if he's never experienced the things he sings about. My advice: live a little, write your own songs from the heart, then use your voice to show people where you're coming from. This album is just sad. If you're over 14, steer clear."
2,RUBEN 2 or 3 stars,"I believe Ruben has a great voice but some of the songs I found not my style in music and I would just breeze right by them. Ruben should do more songs that are slow and some upbeat, but I expected more from him since he is the American Idol. I am sure in whatever style music he goes into he will do fine. I do not compare him to Clay they are totally two different people that is why they get along soo well and sing well together. I think when Ruben comes out with his next Cd he will go more into Luther Vandross style ( I am hoping). That is they way I like him the best slow and soft. Good Luck I wish him the Best,"
2,Oh No Ruben,I liked only 3 songs on the CD. I enjoyed Ruben and voted on the show and this CD is not what we expected. Stick with R and B Ruben. I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed with this.
3,ENOUGH GOSSPAL,"He's good but the whole gosspal thing is really getting on my nerve his songs are also slow. The best song on this album is What is Sexy Feat. Fat Joe. That song at least has a beat with some kind of excitmen!. I don't have this album. I heard it before but if you like sou and R&B, this is the thing for you."
2,No Justice!!!,"Ruben has an excellent voice, however this CD does not do justice to his voice. Not only are most, if not all, of the songs boring and monotonous, they also have the most unintelligent and mundane lyrics I have heard in a long time. Most of the songs sounded as though they were cheap rip offs of popular R&B hits whose main purpose was to attempt to fit in with whats in at the moment instead of focusing on what could be in if Ruben developed his own style. I was strongly disapointed in the fact that this CD didn't showcase Ruben's versatile voice. Ruben has a lot of talent, but if you never watched American Idol you would never be able to figure that out by only listening to this CD. Although I am disapointed in the material on this album, I can look forward to an imrovment in Ruben's next CD. Lets just call this CD a learning experience for Ruben."
2,Reuben get a new manager - recording contract FAST,"Loved the american idol ""Reuben"" and awaited his CD and ordered it in advance...... So Sorry Reuben but it is very disappointing and I know he has so much more to give.... definitely wrong songs; wrong back up; wrong management..... Save yourself Reuben, get whoever Clay Aiken got ... and he is not as good as you Reuben but his CD is much superior... Sorry^pre"
3,Acceptable Debut,"The first time I listened to Ruben's cd the only thought that came to mind was ""mediocre"". Even though they have release Sorry 2004 as the first single, to me there really was no stand out song. The songs are okay, but after listening to the album a couple of times you begin to hear the same beat and rythm on several of the songs. Ruben does have a tremendous voice, and I do believe he has potential. One thing we all have to keep in mind is that when an artist like this first starts out, he is at the mercy of his record company. They pretty much run the show as far as what goes on the album, what they want to promote, the overall sounds, etc. So to say that Ruben has nowhere to go from here would be misleading. I would say that when he gets a little more free reign on his work it will be much, much better. I have to give him 3 stars, and hopefully more sometime in the future."
2,Blah.....Not Soulful,"I think the people who are coming to this board to slam Ruben and praise Clay are totally wrong and unfair. There is a reviewer by the name of Peter (from Canada) who wrote a review on December 27, 2003 entitled ""Nope"". He slammed someone for making the competition between Clay and Ruben a ""race"" issue, but he turns around and do the same thing in his review that day? Who is he to say how black people should feel about the cover art? The question I have for him is...did he even listen to this album because if he didn't, he shouldn't be writing reviews That's being mean and hateful. He knows it and I know it.As for this cd, I don't like it. To me, the only young soulful male artist is R.Kelly, Maxwell and D'Angelo. To me, this cd sounds like corporate soul. Just like Clay is corporate pop. I don't it. I will take Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Al Green and Earth Wind & Fire any day over these jokers (like Ruben). Sorry, but I do not like this cd."
2,Not what I was hoping for ...,"Ruben has a remarkable voice but I honestly don't think this album gave him the right material to showcase it. I loved ""Flying Without Wings"" and was really anticipating the full album -- unfortunately, in my opinon, ""Flying Without Wings"" is probably one of the best two tracks on it. Again, NOT what I waited months for. It's not Ruben that gets two stars, it's the songs. To the producers, writers, A&R, whoever: next time (and I'll buy that CD too) how about a little more ""Play Our Song"" (GREAT, smooth R&B!)and a whole lot less ghetto-love and bling-bling."
2,Gave me a headache - so disappointed,"I gave the CD 2 stars only because, in my opinion, it has a few redeeming tracks, namely, Sorry 2004, How Can you Mend a Broken Heart, Superstar and Flying Without Wings. Only there did I hear the Reuben I had admired on AI... The other tracks literally gave me a headache. Not only were these other tracks filled with annoyingly repetitious dragging beats and insipid lyrics, but Reuben's voice often sounded raspy and strained...like finger nails on a chalk board. If I have to listen to another ""Oh baaaaaby"" or ""Oh yeaaaaah"" I will go nuts. I had originally intended to purchase an additional CD for my niece who is a huge Reuben fan, but I don't want her to be disappointed.Please Ruben, will you choose better material for your next CD? You are capable of so much better."
1,Every Breath you Take,Every Breath Ruben Studdard takes hes gasping for air. This cd is the sorriest I have ever heard. I do not recommend this cd at all unless you need it to put you to sleep. I might recommend Kelly clarksons cd Thankful which is energetic and fun to listen to. That will keep you awake and happy.
2,I am SORRY 2,"Ruben says it all in track #1. SORRY. Yes I am sorry he made fans wait so long for his CD. SOrry that only 5 of the songs are worth listening to. Sorry that stores do not take back CDS that have been opened. Sorry that I did not take the hint from Amazon.com, . Ruben SHOULD be sorry, because he has lost a dedicated fan. Also I will watch the next American Idol- though it is doubtful that I will take the time to rush out to the stores, and stand in line, and pay TOP DOLLAR to buy the next winner's CD. SORRY"
1,Can I return this AWFUL CD!!!???,"Rubens cd is terrible, I got it for a gift! This music, my ears just do not like! Slow songs then hip hop songs! UGH, wish I could return it but the plastic is off, darnit, do not waste your money, and please, do not buy this and give as a gift, terrible!"
4,True to Himself!,"This CD is definitely R&B, and maybe not what the pop-loving AI fans wanted, but that makes me respect Ruben even more. He put out a CD based on HIS style. So what if they sing Disney favorites on American Idol? Ruben sails with smooth ballads, and upbeat hip hop songs on Soulful. I love Ruben's voice! I just hope he gets the respect and the press that Clay has gotten...because he deserves it!"
2,Justme,"AS we all know Clay really won the tile of American Idol, and this Album proves it. I think this is an OK album, but It wont be one that I play very often. Ruben is a very nice guy, and maybe with some more work, he will have a winning album."
4,GREAT START RUBEN,"FIRST LET'S START BY SAY CONGRAD'S TO RUBEN. I THINK HE DID A GREAT JOB ON HIS FIRST CD, BUT I HAVE READ REVIEW'S ON HIS CD, AND IT IS REALLY SAD THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD ARE STILL DIVIDED WITH THIS BLACK, AND WHITE THING REALLY SAD. I THINK RUBEN DID A GREAT JOB ON THE SHOW, BUT PEOPLE THE SHOW IS OVER, MOST CD'S ARE A LITTLE ROCKY ON AT THE START. RUBEN IS A GREAT SINGER, AS WELL AS CLAY, BOTH ARE GREAT, BUT REALLY LISTEN TO THE CD BEFORE JUDGING. THEY ARE 2 DIFFERENT ARTIST WITH DIFFERENT STYLES TRUELY. RUBEN IS R&B, AND CLAY IS BROADWAY LET'S STAY CLEAR ON THE SITUATION, TWO DIFFERENT CATAGORIES OF MUSIC. I KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE MAD, FROM THE VOTING OF THE SHOW, BUT LET IT GO PEOPLE, THE WINNER HAS BEEN ANNOUNCED LET'S MOVE ON PLEASE. THERE ARE MANY ARTIST WITH FIRST CD THAT HAVE NOT COME OUT WITH A BANG, SO WAIT UNTIL CD #2 TO JUDGE RUBEN, READ THE BOOK BEFORE YOU JUDGE THE COVER. OVERALL I THINK IT WAS A GREAT EFFORT TRUELY. A GREAT ADDITION TO A R&B COLLECTION."
1,good try!,"Ruben gave this a good try but, it just didn't work. I hope he didn't hurt his chance at doing what I feel he is capable of. He has the voice and spirit and just needs some good song writers. Doing songs that have already been special hits do not need to be done over unless you can truly make it your own. I do not feel Ruben did this with his CD. Good luck next time. You are a sweetheart!"
1,samplecd,"Why is it that Amazon does not have tracks that can be played prior to buying the ""Soulful"" CD? Is there a reason? This review is for Amazon??????I notice the other artist have samples of the CD--appears that Amazon is afraid to have anything heard on this CD before it is bought...I wonder why??????I will make my determination once I hear the samples..until then..no way..will not waste my money!!!!!"
4,Clay Who? - Ruben Shines Through,"Simply put, this is exactly what it is described as: Soulful. Ruben, I believe, set out to make a traditional, classic, R&B album. He succeeded with flying colors! Outstanding cuts such as ""After the Candles Burn"" and ""For All We know"" reminds us of a young Teddy Pendergrass. Cuts like ""Sorry 2004"" and ""Take the Shot"" scream the up-tempo stylings of Luther Vandross - (remember - ""Stop to Love""?) I am a fan of American Idol, thru and thru. I brought Kelly's album (loved it), Justin's album (it wasn't great), all of the combo albums (cool), BUT CLAY'S ALBUM WAS TRULY TRASH!! That album is the same song, over and over again! Clay is a good singer, but he is no Pop Star! If you love R&B, soul music, then you know that Ruben's album speaks directly to ""our"" music. Pick up this album and let everyone know who is the ""real"" American IDOL Winner - Ruben Studdard!!!!!"
4,Pleased,"Unlike all the other comments made by others. I think that the CD is in very good taste. It is good finally to hear someone sing a song or songs with meaning for a change. Some would think that because Ruben is a young person that he should sing or rap about gang life, being a playa, or being gangster. That is what sets him apart from the rest. Ruben will be around for the long haul because he has true talent. We are missing talent in today's music world. Ruben is a part of our rebuilding in the music world. Ruben is the American Idol not Clay and that happened for a reason! The current CD is nice. It identifies with who Ruben really is. I like it a lot and I'm looking forward to hearing from Ruben more in the near future."
4,Good Music For Adults,"So glad its not teeny bopper pop. Adult songs for adult listerns. It is smooth and well, soulful. This cd is only $10, pick it up and you won't be disappointed. You might not like EVERY track but there are some gems! Songs from the show are my faves, Superstar and How Do You Mend A Broken Heart, Excellent!!! There are other good ones too. Check it out."
4,Like the song,"I'm just collecting this cd. I like the song. I got it unopened so even better. There's nothing much to say, it only has one song, so don't go crying thinking that it's a cd with a lot of songs."
5,This is one nasty man!,"My mother gave me this book after she read it. I am a high school senior and reading it gave me the chills. I could have been one of his victims! If my mother hadnt had an eye to see him for the predator that he is, I might have fallen into his grasp. Yes, I know who he is, even though the names have been changed. And I know a couple of the victims too. They are from a wealthy family in our town and did everything to hide after the news came out. This man ruined their lives forever. I want to see him punished but it will never happen unless somebody takes him to court. He thinks he is getting away with it. Someday, he is going to answer to the highest court and then what will he do???"
5,"Uncanny, Superior Look at Clergy Abuse","This book is shocking. That is the best word I can use to describe it. You will have to put the book down at certain points to try to make connections in your mind about this terrible man. Hopefully, anyone who reads it can get the help they need... I wish someone would make a movie from this book so millions of people will be alerted about the terrible crimes committed ""in the name of God""."
4,Did you know...,"...that Shetland fishermen considered ""persons deformed at birth"" good luck because they were considered God's poor and that if they had good luck they gave the person some of their catch?...Rubys prevent all evil?...that if a burgular has coal in his pocket he'll be able to evade capture?I have the version of this book that was published in 1949--found it in the giveaway pile at my local library. This book is fantastic for dipping, fun or for ghost stories. We had an electrical outing, and I read snippets by candlelight to my family. My little brother (who was 15) was terrified and made me stop.At this price you can't say no to this book. It's fun and pretty scary at the same time.Highly recommended."
4,"Great read, doubles as a horror writer's resource","This is a fun, rather small book (in respect to superstitions in general, this could have been a mammoth of a book) that includes various bizarre and funny superstitions both old and current. Some are given instances when the superstition held true. For example, apparently it is unlucky for a three cigarettes to be lit off the same match. Three men, after doing this, one remarked ""One of us will die by the end of the year"" in jest, and then died three days later of a monkey bite (that last line made me howl...a monkey bite, of all things). Also, if you're a horror writer there's plenty of material here to help you base a story around. Four stars only because I wish it were longer, but it's a bargain and if you're into this kind of thing highly recommended. Very easy and fun to read."
4,Curtral Anthropology in a Detailed Sense,"I wouldn't have normally purchased this book if it wasn't for a course requirement. From chapter one all the way to the end, the authors take the reader or student through a detailed interface of what life is like experienced in other cultures. It touches upon the four different career interests in cultural anthropology as well. A time consuming read, but loaded with useful information for in and out of the class room."
4,Just a book for class.,"I did get a used book for a class. It is a great buy, I would've paid $148 for a new one at school, but I asked the teacher and he said this older edition would be fine, so I saved myself a ton of money. The book is in good condition, too."
1,Intolerable,"This is among the most frustratingly uninteresting textbooks I've ever read. Every chapter takes the same dull, sensationalistic view of its subject, citing a limitless number of redundant examples of life in lesser-known cultures while condemning every aspect of modern, industrial cultures. Each unit restates the same cliches ad nauseam, and reading this material does nothing to enhance one's appreciation for humanity or for science. It is a terrible and tiresome introduction to anthropology."
1,Disappointing for the Educated Reader,"The editors' review would lead you to believe this is an unbiased, thorough and scholarly examination of cultural anthropology. It is not. There is subtle age, gender, cultural and religious bias. Although it is a thorough look at various cultures, it is by no means comprehensive or accurate. It is inaccurate in highlighted descriptions of minor aspects of Native American culture, especially of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation. It seems to imply Western European cultures and various organized religions are the greatest evil on the planet. The portrayal of some cultures, such as the Malaysian, Pacific Island, and a few of the African Bushmen cultures, are very nice but that is the only redeeming quality of this text. Real scholars should avoid this text at all costs!"
1,Terrible Book!!!,"I tried to read and like this book; I really did. But after about 1/3 I refused to go on. Nothing truly worthy while is in this book, the writers do nothing but praise anthropology without telling you more about it, and all information is from a naturalistic, relativism, and liberal stand point. Anthropology hinges on the stance taken, and I think these writers would discover much by opening their minds."
3,Info wanted,"What is the CDfor in the 11th edition? I'm interested in the book, but most editions don't diff dramatically, but I do notice the 11th comes with a cd."
1,Misleading text,"This text explores human nature in a completely dry, systematic, and cliched manner. It conveys none of the realities of human experience. It describes the customs and practices followed by only a handful of societies in the world, and it does so in a distorted and often sensationalized manner. For example, it portrays Christianity as a simple religion of snake handlers, and it describes the Christian practice of eating the body of God in the COMMUNION WATER! The text communicates that there is no meaning or reason to human existence, and it picks apart each aspect of humanity until there is nothing left but the absurdity of all human thought and belief. If you wish to understand Man's history, get a firsthand look at what Man has written, built, believed, and striven for throughout the ages. Don't go to this book to have your questions answered. I don't know who wrote that ridiculous one sentence review about this book being wonderful, but they were a moron to do so."
1,Book Sucks,"This book is down to earth stupid! Through out the text, haviland insults Western countries by saying that they are all uncivilized and their way of life is far inferior when compared w/ other indegineous cultures. If he has a Ph.D., he should know better that insulting any culture is the trait of a narrow-minded person - not a guy who holds a ph.d. He also mocks religion constantly and the book repeats the same thing in several chapters...its like after a while you'll say ""dude, we get the point, move on!"". Don't buy it, unless u are a college student and your teacher requires it (I don't know y they would)."
4,Very interesting book,"The Execution of Private Slovik reads somewhat like a college term paper but because of the gripping subject it maintains the reader's interest. Thoroughly documented and cited, the author goes to great pains to challenge the reader to question why this event occurred. The author's question centers on whether Eddie was accurate in his belief that he was really being punished for the petty crimes of his youth. Great book for WWII buffs as well as people interested in Death Penalty issue."
5,A Supposed Example for an Army Deserter Gone Awry,"Thank you, William Bradford Huie, for this wonderful, fully documented historical book about the execution of Private Slovik near the end of WWII. Private Slovik said he would never shoot his rifle and the Army knew this. He deserted briefly but returned on his own initiative. Yes, he had a court-martial, for which he pleaded guilty. (Everyone else that deserted and caught either pleaded not guilty, was locked up, or just hid out for the remainder of the war, knowing that they would never be court-martialed after the war was over). Private Slovik was ""executed"" to set an example for potential deserters. But if this was for an ""example"" why was it kept a secret, even from his wife, for many years, and it was only through the author that his wife (and the rest of the world) found out about his execution years after the war was over. General Eisenhower was the approving authority, but funny how his memory of this event became vague. A must read."
5,"Straightforward, accessible resource","I'm giving this book 5 stars in spite of the Horrible editing (seriously--Horrible). I figure, I don't need this guy to teach me grammar, I need him to tell me how to general contract my home, and he does that. Very well.The book walks you through each subcontractor you will need to hire, and issues to be aware of with each. There are also sections on choosing a lot, and financing the home. I found useful information on nearly every page."

5,Finally the live CD we've been waiting for!,"Some three years after the breakup of perhaps one of the last post-Nirvana great punk hopes, this gem from the live Jawbreaker vaults is released - confirming with each blistering track something fans knew all along - that Blakes' vocals were always stronger live and toned down in comparison to their last studio release ""Dear You."" Some of Jawbreaker's best tracks are here, including ""Jinx Removing"" and ""Boxcar"" and they truly never sounded better, with the distortion of Blake's Gibson billowing and the vocals sounding like true ""Bivouac"" era-Jawbreaker - ruff, edgy and full of heart. Thank God this was released. It's beautiful. The few unreleased tracks included here resoundingly suggest Jawbreakers' finest moments weren't behind them - ""Gemini"" is just amazing. There's no point in wondering what if now. It's just so apparent they could have taken over whenever they wanted to."
5,More on Nelson as a man and lover than as a warrior,"Even so, the book is very good and will be a nice addition to your library. My thoughts are that this book is for someone who knows nothing or little about Horatio Lord Nelson. Whereas the Nelson fan will already have read all the contents elsewhere the novice will find this a very useful single-volume overview. I strongly recommend it for those readers."
