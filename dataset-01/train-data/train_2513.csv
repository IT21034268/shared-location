2,TOO Large,"I had an old bacon tray that broke. Bought this one thinking that since the old one was kinda small, I should get the large. But it is too large, and the turn table in the microwave gets bumped off it's track with this large tray that is too large to turn in the microwave.I reccomend you buy a Medium size if there is one. Or check your microwave turntable size and see if they have a size on this product before buying."
1,cooked the tray too,"I had purchased two of these bacon trays on Amazon from a third party vendor, and both of them are now burnt. I had a very difficult time getting the bacon to cook evenly. In addition to that the same spot on both trays burned after only use. One of them actually started to burn straight through the tray."
2,Bacon microwaveable tray????????,"Wow! I was so glad to finally find the bacon cooker, HOWEVER it doesnot hold up. WHAT A SURPRISE when I held one end to remove thegrease, the tab (handle broke off). This was to new to be so fragil.I am glad I got to use it a few times before reviewing it.It would be great if they said, you can only use it twice, and itbreaks when hot. I Will not purchase this again.[[ASIN:B0002MR0TKProgressive International Microwavable Large Bacon Cooker]]"
1,sucked,This bacon tray melted upon first use. tThen the lips were so shallow the bacon boiled in grease instead of roasting .DON'T BUY
4,cute,"I would define this album as ""cute"" and catchy. I really like it a lot! It's fun, and you just want to listen to each song over and over.This is how I rate it:1.Alchohol & Bandages (10/10): very catchy song kinda weak lyrics but this song was a good intro song because it made me want to listen to it more.2.Best Mistake (8/10): Good song. I didn't like it at first but it grew on me.3.Goodbyes (9/10) I like the sound of this song.4.Tearing Through Me (10/10) short but one of my favorite songs on this album.5.Paper, Rock, Scissors (7/10) It's Ok. That's really it.6.Emergency Room Romantic (9/10) Loveee this songgggggg!7.Dusk, The Day After (10/10) I love this song. It's beautiful.8.Slow Suicide (6/10) Not a big fan of this song. My least favorite.9.Here's Everything I've Always Wanted (7/10) Not my favorite but it's a nice song to listen to.10.The Here And Now (10/10) My favorite song on the album! Amazing! I love it!11.I should mean more (9/10) Great closing song."
1,stremlite,this was one of very few items I bought that was absolute junk! I retuned the flashlight three seperate times because there was so much corrosion in the threads I could not eve get the thing apart to put the batteries in. These flashlights looked like they had been sitting in a storage room or bin for years next to the ocean or some very corrosive area. Very displeased with this product. But had absolutely no problem with amazon in finally asking for a refund. Whoever the supplier is they have crap products.
2,Extremely disappointing,"I bought this book primarily because of the author's past writings. I'm very disappointing at how basic this little book is in light of the author's previously demonstrated knowledge.This book is even more basic than most introductory books, and the information it contains is quite thin. I'm further disheartended to find nothing new here. Essentially the book is just another rehash of what has been commonly published over, and over, and over again.What you'll find in this book is the typical sketchy rituals of the full moon and sabbats you've seen before, and the same lame initiation rituals that keep popping up in every book written since the 1960s. I'm afraid that if you have one or two of ANY basic book on Wicca then you already have everything you'll find in this book.Argh, just when I thought it was safe to buy another Wicca book... :("
1,"Book of Shadows - By ""Migene Gonzalez-Wippler","This is another order in which I was sent the wrong book. The book I received was ""ShadowQueen"" by Debbi Federici & Susan Vaught. Can these people read or what. I am not happy at all. I wait for my books and have been charged for them and it is the wrong book.Thank you,Mona Ghaffari"
5,Drink- tansic,Another great Season of Three Sheets! To bad MOJO went out:( Hopefully someone somewhere will pick upthe Show. There is even a little extra in this season.
1,Too big and heavy,I have returned both the cage and the stand. The stand came with no hardware or caps for the ends. The cage is very large and ornate. Very disappointed ! Would not recommend.
2,Hard to Clean,"This is a very pretty cage, but hard to clean--doo-doo gets stuck in the sides and for some reason it's hard to access. I have another cockatiel who is in a different (larger) cage, which is much easier to clean (it has a metal slide-out tray--instead of plastic, which I think makes a difference). This may be just too small for a cockatiel (and the roosts are plastic, instead of wood--not the preferred medium). I'll be buying another, easier to clean, cage..."
3,Beautiful Cage But Not Sturdy Enough To Move A Lot,"This beautiful cage worked well for a couple of years for our parakeets. I always put them with their cage outside in a tree during the daytime on warm spring, summer and fall days, but usually in their smaller cage. They love it; it makes them so happy; they feel natural and wild. However, when I took them out in this large cage, it didn't last long. The curved bars hooked onto a small tree limb, and when taking it down the cage broke apart and we lost our beloved birds. If you buy this cage you won't want to move it very much because it's heavy and awkward and will break apart. Left in one place it's attractive and spacious."
1,Bar spacing too large!,"Since most people would consider this cage for their smaller birds - finches, lovebirds, etc. - I think it's important to note that the bar spacing is NOT suitable for those birds. There are several great sites for info on what is appropriate for your bird. Please research first and buy the correct product so your pet does not injure himself. 5/8 spacing is fine for small parrots (conures, Quakers) but this cage is on small size for them."
3,"A decent movie, but if you like Bob & Doug....","but haven't seen SCTV, you should check out the SCTV box sets. There are ""Great White North"" (Bob & Doug) skits on those shows that are funnier than what's contained in this movie. Go for Volumes 2 & 3 if you're looking for Bob & Doug. I'm a huge SCTV fan (I have all 5 volumes) so I like this movie too, but it's pretty cheesy and not really THAT consistently funny like the improvised skits on SCTV. For really interesting reading material about Bob & Doug and SCTV, see Dave Thomas' (Doug's) book, SCTV."
5,This is the greatest movie of all time!,"OK, so if you're looking at this item, you probably already agree with me, eh? but here's something you may or may not have known. Strange Brew is actually an adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth! I kid you not. Think about it: uncle kills brother to take over kingdom (Elsinore Brewery, in this case), the rightful heir has to unravel the murder to gain her place, etc. etc.Anyhoo, I've seen this movie more times than any other, and it provides more qpm (quotes per minute) than any other film."
4,It is OK Eh,"I have seen it before and it is a classic, guy-humor fun movie that doesn't require too much thinking! It is fun since I have had the Canadian and Northern Minnesota experience many times."
5,"""Take off...""","My brother and I grew up on SCTV and enjoyed the good natured dopiness of Canadian brothers Bob and Doug McKenzie. To this day my brother and I greet each other by asking ""Fleshy headed mutant, are you friendly?"" To which one can only respond, ""No way eh? Radiation has made me an enemy of civilization."""
1,Bob & Doug in 3-B (Three beers),"This farce DARES to call itself a comedy.Bob & Doug must stop an evil genius (Max Von Sydow) from distributing a beer that's tainted with a mind controlling serum.Rick Moranis & Dave Thomas were MUCH funnier than this on SCTV. The only part I laughed at is the ""superdog"" sequence...and that's it. The rest is filled with endless bathroom jokes, sadistic humor, and just plain nonsense. Max Von Sydow's wooden acting stinks on ice. Not even Mel Blanc's guest voice can save this movie. Not recommended. Take off, eh...this DVD!"
1,I just cannot understand the attraction of this movie.,"A friend of mine thinks that this movie is great, but I just can't get it. As I watched it, I sat there wondering when this movie was going to be as funny as my friend says it is. Bob and Doug are downright annoying. I blame this movie for the creation of so-called ""Canadian"" humor. If you want real Canadian humor, go watch old Kids in the Hall episodes or The Newsroom. The Edison Twins was funnier than this movie."
3,the mcenzie brothers from s.c.t.v. drink a lot of beer.,I realy like these guys so this was a little disopointmant
3,Great movie should have great DVD,"No commentary from Moranis and Thomas? Why buy a DVD that has no commentary, especially 20 years after the fact, especially for such a rip-roaring film? I'll just keep watching my lame VHS until a worthwhile DVD is released."
3,A Tasty Brew,"For starters, I was not a big fan of the McKenzie Brothers when they were on""SCTV"". I thought their gags about Canada were unfunny and obvious. So, why do I recommend ""Strange Brew""? Generally, sketches that are extended to feature-lenghth do not work(do I have to go into the various SNL spin-offs to prove my point?). They attempted to do something ambitious here by fusing their goofy humor with ""Hamlet"". They have a decent supporting cast here with Max von Sydow standing out as the villainous Brewmeister Smith. This is akin but not quite on the level with what the Coen brothers did with ""The Odyssey"" in ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"""
3,probably the dumbest yet funny movies ever,these guys are so stupid that this movie is funny it does get boring in long stretches but these guys are funny in a stupid way but you'll like it eh unless your a hosier
3,These Guys Are Real Hosers Eh?,"Boy, this was a fun movie to watch once or twice, at least for me. Additional viewings just didn't have the comedic effect that first ones did. It's like good beer that has gone flat. Still, I have fond memories of this film.The movie starts off funny, somewhat of a forerunner of a ""Wayne's World"" flick with the boys pretending to be in a film or on TV. Here, the two ""stars"" are Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas, both of whom make light of a couple Canadian guys who love their beer, and little else. Everyone is a ""hoser"" and every sentence ends in ""eh?"" It's fnny at first, but gets a little too repetitive after the 500th time. It's like, ""Ok, we get the joke, you hosers!""Still, 25 years later - thanks to this film - I always laugh thinking of these two boobs saying ""hoser."""
4,The McKinzie brothers should be Canadian icons,This movie is one laugh to the next. From the very begining you are swept up into the world of Bob & Doug as they go about thier zany adventure.
3,Strange Brew = a mouse in a bottle!,"I liked this movie because it is quirky and fun... a perfect movie for a few friends to watch and you don't have to drink beer to watch this one, but it helps if you like jelly donuts. There is a plot, but most parents, if they are like mine, will think this is a ridiculous movie... it is a lot like Raising Arizona, just as good and just as corny."
4,Most Excellent,"This is a great addition to any classic collection which includes, Christmas Vacation, Blazin Saddles, Fletch, although my wife fell asleep right before the dark side of the force battled the light side to the death in an Ice Hockey Match. If you are a true comic lover, this one is for you."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"This is a pretty good movie. Somewhat juvenile, but entertaining. If you were a fan of Second City's ""McKenzie Brothers"", you'll like this movie. And understand why there was never a second one."
5,Goofy Funny,"This movie is just great for laughs. The film has a relation to Shakespeare's Hamlet that is enjoyable. It is not a rendition of the play but rather a new story that uses characters and elements from the play. There are some memorable lines that stick with you. ""All's I got's two fives."""
3,What took so long,"I had waited for this movie to come out on DVD for what seemed like forever. When I finally got it, it was roughly the same as the VHS in both content and quality. There is some bonus material, but as a Bob and Doug fan, there wasn't nearly enough.It did have one particularly good SCTV skit and an episode their animated cartoon, which is dreadful. However, I would have liked to have found a commentary with Moranis and Thomas included. Something to let me, the viewer, in on the behind the scenes stuff. So far I haven't found that anywhere in the menus.The movie itself is great. Exactly like the original. How can you not love it eh?"
3,Strange Brew,If you do not understand Canadian Comedy you will probably not like this. It is funny in a cheesy 80s way. The plot is garbage. The acting is over the top. The special effects scream 80s style. The dialogue might make you want start the dvd on fire also. Yet somehow if you have afew beers its turns into a watchable/ quotable movie. Not bad.
3,"Beer, more beer, and no hang over...","The two brothers Doug (Dave Thomas) and Bob (Rick Moranis) escape the very first public screening of their own film by going home to their parents and having a beer. However, they have lost the beer money that their dad gave them and now they have to find away to get free beer. After some twists and turns they end up at Elsinore's Brewery where they get jobs and in turn as much beer as they need. However, there is a conspiracy brewing within the walls of the brewery that is led by Brewmeister Smith (Max von Sydow). The parody that Strange Brew provides is at times hysterical, but the overall film experience is poor and jerky."
4,Good Flick eh,"This is a good flick to sit down with the Coleman, some back bacon and some beers to watch, eh. I laughed so hard I gots a bleedin' nose. Good Day eh."
3,"Zoom In On This, Eh?","I can not tell you how disappointed I was when this movie finally came out on DVD last year. I wanted nothing more than to hear Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis do audio commentary over the film IN CHARACTER as Bob & Doug McKenzie. The cast of ""This Is Spinal Tap"" did this for the DVD of their movie, and the result was hilarious. Another 90 minute off-the-cuff routine from Bob & Doug commenting on their own movie would've made this the ultimate. But alas, it just wasn't to be. And what's up with the Dolby 2.0 sound? Give us our free 5.1 Surround Sound, eh? Oh well, guess I got my hopes up too much, and I'm just glad to finally have this great 80's classic on DVD.Five stars for the movie, one for the DVD, average score of three."
4,The Brew!,I've seen this movie over a hundred times it seems. The bestpart to me was the fact that it was two guys who sat around drank beerand reviewed movies. Sounds typical to the ladies. but the only thing that really upset me was the fact that a family member messed up the only copy of The Brew and now I can't find it anywhere... END
4,A Must See!!!,"If you haven't seen ""Strange Brew"" yet, you must be a hoser. Pssst! Act! Act! Statue of Liberty?! This is one of the best comedies I've ever had the pleasure to watch. Side-splitting. I saw it for the first time probably fifteen years ago, and it still is funny as hell. Think Cheech and Chong with beer, only funnier. Watch for the improvised ending when the credits roll. Thomas and Moranis HAVE to be tanked for real! No pun intended. Fleshy-headed mutant commands you to buy it."
4,Forget the obvious it's Shakespeare!,Funny I should learn to appreciate such a seemingly ridiculous film. But this farce is actually Hamlet... with some minor revisions. Beyond the comedic value try to find as many references to the Bard as you can. There's more going on in Elsinore than meets the eye.
5,Strange Brew,"Strange Brew is a very interesting movie with lots of character. The movie was fun for my crazy, witty family. My grand-daughter has been watching non-stop and has been introducing it to her friends."
5,where's the DVD?,"As you may have guessed, I'm a big fan. I even named my film company ""Hoser Productions"" after them. A commentary by Bob and Doug (ala Spinal Tap) would be a tremendous treat."
5,Great for the newbie!!,"I am not a fan of exercise but this is the one tape I keep going back to. I love it! It's great for those of us who aren't exactly coordinated,too. The routine is easy to pick up, the pace is just right for the newbie and best of all, you see the results quickly!! I've worn my tape out and am here buying a new one!!"
5,Very encouraging results!,"I was really a die-hard anti-exerciser, and I got this as a joke, but it is really terrific. It is easy to follow and I saw results VERY fast! I'm here looking for more tapes by the instructor."
3,Just 1 problem here,"This unit works great. Connected it to my 2125 smartphone quickly. The only problem I really had was that it does not come with a power supply to charge it. It depends completely on your PDA adapter to charge it. Yes I said PDA and I want to use it with my smartphone. Luckily I also had a compatible PDA charger. The unit actually comes with a splitter that plugs into your PDA and the Bluetooth Dock, then you plug your existing transformer into the spliter. Good idea but to include a transformer as well would have been nice. Also as noted in other reviews the blue light is a little too bright when driving at night."
4,Works Great...,"(here comes the BUT)...but, it did not come with a travel charger. it has good rechargable battery life, but if you're going to be using it for extended trips, purchase the car charger as well."
3,Problem with connection,"I used cable version of Pharos GPS.It worked well.Due to change my pda phone, I purchased bluetooth dock.It has some connection problem.The connection keeps disconnected after around 1 minutes.I'm not sure where the problem is located at.It may be on my pda phone, my setting, or the product.I'm not experter about this technology.I just want to help new buyer's decision."
4,good blue tooth GPS receiver,I have use wire receiver before. I choose this blue tooth deck recently. It is realy good and easy to use.
2,Strains my tea,"I prefer loose tea in my Brown Betty teapot. The resulting product is more flavorful than using a tea ball. The problem was that the tea didn't always settle to the bottom and I'd end up with leaves in my tea. This little device was dandy. I set it on my cup, poured the tea and NO LEAVES!! It's simple and cheap and does the job. Fits all of my mugs (I don't own a teacup). The sieve is large enough to contain all the tea leaves in both my small (3 cup) and large (6 cup)teapots. Since nobody I know drinks tea but me, I don't need anything fancy. However, the shipping for this product was outrageous ($8.00). There was no place to select a lower and slower shipping option."
2,wouldn't buy again,"I'm not so worried about the craftmanship, I just needed an extra strainer. The problem I have is that it doesn't always reach into the tea. My current strainer actually fits into the cup and when I pour water onto it, it steeps. This strainer isn't deep enough to do that in most of my mugs. It sits above the water unless I fill the cup much more than I'd like to."
5,Best lancets of any I've used,"Can't believe there's that much difference, but these seem a bit sharper than some I I've used. I have a LOT of testers, and these have been the best."
2,Scatterbrained Stories,"As one reviewer stated that it is like an ""elderly relative"" recalling stories - only if that person is completely scatterbrained. The writer jumps from story to story with little or no connection and without a central theme or purpose. Yet there has got to be a hundred plus names of persons who often appear once and then are never heard from again. Its like listening to an old timer who is rambling on and on and you keep looking at the clock wondering if a enough time has passed before you can politely say ""Well...look at the time....gotta go"""
5,Funny!,this movie was decently funny the first time and better the 2nd time you watch it. one of those movies like happy gilmore where you will watch it over and over again over the years.Dr Dan
1,Hot Rod Review,"I was extremely disappointed to open hot rod, put it in my dvd player too find out the disc doesn't work. I tried it on 3 tv's and 3 dvd players... I would like my money back."
4,Hot Rod,This is a hysterical movie. One that you can watch over and over and it makes you laugh harder every time.
3,Just another ugly teen comedy?,"The name ""Hot Rod' seems to be used here as a minimization or abasementof the lead character. In this teen comedy mode the hero is madecontemptible and ridiculous, so that when he overcomes the odds,his triumph is complete. Rod drives an under-horsed mopedand tries to jump a swimming pool at about half the speed he needs.He is just plain pathetic and embarrassing!Can the underdog ever win? That seems to be the comedy feature here."
2,Unfunny comedy,"Andy Samberg does not have a natural comedian talent, and trying hard in this regard does not make things better, or does it? Perhaps to them who think Adam Sandler is a talented comedian, Andy may appear funny ha-ha, sort of Sandler-lite.""Hot Rod"" tries to be a nutty-witty sort of comedy with noticeable attempts at ""witty"" and sometimes ""nutty."" However, its plot and gags are way too predictable for ""nutty,"" while some ""funnies"" go on for too long, or repeat too many times for ""witty."" It will leave you with unpleasant aftertaste-like musing: ""and that's all??""Not recommended. I rate it an extra star for avoiding profane language and for the lack of anti-Christian sacrilege, which has become obligatory in almost every new Hollywood production."
1,The movie does not play.,I put the movie in our DVD player and it isn't read and spits the movie back out. Not happy.
3,Lost interest after about an hour,"'Hot Rod' had it's moments, but the lead character (and the general humor of the movie) got annoying & tired after a while. The movie was more of a prolonged skit, though; not a terrible sunday afternoon time waster.It's worth a rental, not a purchase."
4,"Very, Very Funny!!!","I laughed so hard I was crying!!!! I didn't know what to expect with this movie, but man is it funny!! It's like watching Wile E. Coyote.The Punch-Dance scene is absolutey hysterical!!!!"
4,Cheap laughs not for everyone!,"I enjoyed this movie, its filled with low brow humor and near ""retarded"" schemes! this movie probably isn't for everyone but if you are looking for a lite entertaining nonsensical flick take the plunge you may be surprised!the hd transfer is better than the sd version and worth the purchase if its in a comparable price point to the sd otherwise I keep most of my hd purchases limited to visually and aurally impressive movies!"
4,hot rod,Stupid but funny. A moive teenagers will laugh about. A movie that has some great one liners and a love story so it catches the attention of girls and boys.
4,Silly Fun.,"I originally viewed this movie with my daughter and we laughed through the entire thing. I purchased this so we can share a good laugh when the mood strikes. The humor is quite silly and somewhat goofy and juvenille, but sometimes, that's just what the Dr. ordered! ;-)"
3,It is what it is.,"This movie is so stupid, it's funny. It was exactly what I thought it was...a cheesy but fun movie from many cast members of SNL. Tons of lame 80's music though :( Still happy I bought it."
1,DON'T ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE!,"I got 3 HD DVDs & none of them worked in my HD DVD player. I emailed customer service & got a rude response & was told to ""Please read Amazon description before purchasing"" well I did, the DVDs don't work & they aren't offering to fix the problem. Spend your money elsewhere!! I'll never order from here again."
2,Scrathes!,"I bought this used dvd and it scratches so much, I am really disappointed. I just don't know why someone would sell a dvd in this condition. However, I got it super fast so that was a plus."
1,HDDVD?????,"Boo hoo! Boo hoo! Son was really wanting this movie for a long time. I wish Mrs. Claus better understood HD DVD. Now he has the movie, but nothing we own will play it. I read carefully before purchase and didn't see where you needed a special player to play it on. One that most people don't own. I should have googled before purchase not after. Lesson learned. Hopefully, this will help someone else before they buy."
2,A really false start for Andy Samberg,"We have watched so many SNL comics either rise or fall when they move to the giant screen.With a script that was written by Pam Brady of SOUTH PARK MOVIE fame, I had anticipated something hopefully funny,bigger and longer than what I had seen on the trailers. It didn't happen.My opinion here is that the script is so not funny especially since it is mostly involved with Andy Samburg as Rod, training for the stunt of clearing fifteen school buses that will raise money to help his sick stepfather.Sorry, but this is really boring as humorless sight gags and really bad plot elements destroy anything that Samburg could do to make this material funny.If you liked NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, which this film so reminds me of, then I doubt you will like HOT ROD.Sorry."
4,I thought it was hilarious,"Alright, seeing a lot of negativity around this movie, which is too bad. It's going to turn a lot of people off from watching it. I rented this not expecting much and I was surprised to find myself laughing my @$$ off shortly after it started. I'd place this movie up there with Talladega Nights and Blades of Glory. The only thing missing is Will Ferrell, but that's alright. I think people may be taking this movie too seriously. I think that this movie pokes a lot of fun at itself, and there are some awful scenes to back that up (the whole Flashdance thing). You'll either find these scenes hysterical or horrible. It all depends on your sense of humor and the mood you're in. If your dog died this morning, yeah, you'll probably hate it. If you enjoyed Blades of Glory (and yes, I know a lot of people didn't), you'll probably dig this."
4,"Screwball, irreverent; yes please!","This movie had me laughing from start to finish. Why? It throws away a lot of typical comedic conventions, plays with pacing and brings irreverence to a whole new level.Wait, plays with pacing? Yes. Segues? gone. Leave the viewer waiting for more when all other movies would have taken the cheap laugh? borderline brilliant (in terms of comedy. This is NOT a brainy film).There's a different feel to this movie that I'm sure will leave some viewers behind...which may also explain its poor box office sales. But if you're up for the laughs in a comedy that does more than kick someone in the crotch and wait for high school boys to laugh, then this is it.All-in-all. Two thumbs up. Watch it with some friends and I dare you not to laugh till your stomach hurts.Parents: Outside of a brief drug reference (acid, plays almost no part in the film) and some occasional language, this movie wouldn't be too much for a young teen to handle."

1,Hotrod dvd,DVD arrived rattling. Open to find dvd loose inside amd scratched. Thaaaaanks. I will send back in hopes of replacement.
4,"""Souls Of The Animal Kingdom!""","The small budget '07 film `Hot Rod' is a zany, unpretentious, Indie looking production that you will either find absolutely hilarious or leave you wondering ""what in the world was that all about?"" My initial reaction put me in the ""what was that all about"" camp however as I began to reflect back on some of the parodies and dialogue I found myself chuckling over what I had missed during my viewing of this film.Andy Samberg and Bill Hader are hilarious, Isla Fisher is adorable and the rest of the cast is rock solid. Lots of inane comedy value to be had by one and all, just please don't attempt any of the stunts you will view on your own. Leave them to the real stuntmen out there."
1,Wretched,"Hot Rod is easily the worst film I've ever seen. Like Napoleon Dynamite, it seems that we are supposed to be laughing at mentally retarded people. But Napoleon Dynamite, as much as I disliked that film, is miles better than Hot Rod. I can't imagine what Sissy Spacek and Ian Mcshane are doing in this puerile mess of a movie.If you want to watch a truly funny film about young people, see Superbad instead and let Hot Rod crash and burn and disappear into oblivion."
1,How many ways can you say stupid?,"This MIGHT not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is definitely in my top five for all-time worst! I wasn't expecting anything deep, but it would have been nice if it wasn't just so stupid! Sissy Spacek is MUCH too good for this. I was disappointed to see her talent wasted on this dreck. It's not even funny when it tries to be, and come on - when he falls down the side of a mountain, he's barely even hurt? give me a break. Don't waste your time on this. it's TERRIBLE."
5,Great Movie,This is THE funniest movie I have ever seen. It's free with Amazon Prime also. Andy Samberg is a great actor and the cast of this movie is a great one
4,Great movie but,"Hot Rod is a hilarious funny movie. If you like stupid, slapstick humor, than this is for you. My only complaint is why is this movie $49 for the blu ray disc? I'm not sure if i'm missing something here on why the product is so expensive for the blu ray version."
1,Watch out for FAKES!!!,"I love Realm perfume. I'm talking about the real stuff. Not the crap I paid for only to receive it and it's obviously a fake. The bottle has frosted glass on it. It smells vaguely like the real one, but doesn't go on or wear the same. DO NOT EVER buy an un-boxed perfume on Amazon. It won't be the real deal.."
2,"At one time, sailors relied on almanacs for navigation...","But detailed data of tides and star positions have been eliminated from popular almanacs long ago.But they still supposed to be more than books of historic or trivial facts, but should present important, and timely, data at one's finger tip in order to help navigate through the difficulties of life.And once such piece of data, for me, was the current postal rates (or at least current at the time of printing.)I was shocked that such an important collection of data was not available in this book!Yeah, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is an interesting and important document; but it was passed and promptly ignored by much of the ""universe"" over fifty years ago.If I have a package to send out, I want to know the cost NOW!On the other hand, purchasing this book IS a cheap way to truthfully claim that you have the Encyclopaedia Britannica..."
1,Broken after one use,"This is supposed to be a more rugged hose nozzle. It happens to have a flimsy plastic piece near the top for the trigger handle that allows the flow of water. While winding the hose, it dropped three times on the ground and snapped, rendering the whole thing useless. Yay for a waste of money."
2,Video noise problems,"I bought two of these units based on the first comment.They are easy to install and are easily hidden. But I ended uphaving to return both units, because the video on both cameraskept getting a lot of video noise after they were in use for a while.I could not set the sensitivity on my DVR low enough to counter actthe noise to prevent false triggering, which would result in continuous recording. I just couldn't use these cameras. It's too bad, becausethey look like nicely built units, and would be ideal for hiddensecurity purposes."
1,LOTS OF INTERFERENCE,"No matter what channel it was on there was alot of interference. Also Loud crackling noises, distorted picture and very annoying. Sent it back."
2,The First 100 Pages,"In the first 100 pages I learned a lot about Presidents and Arab Kings. Who knew they were into the RV-ing lifestyle? Next thing you know they'll be spotted at a KOA.A big disappointment, sorry to say."
2,An improbable kidnapping,"With a surgically military precision Peter Branson and his men plan the kidnapping of the President of the US and his two guests from the Middle East, a prince and a king. The kidnapping is to take place in the middle of the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco and Branson is expecting a large ransom if everything goes according to his plan.A rather unrealistic adventure story."
3,Correction to another earlier review,"Just a comment regarding 'Mary Agnes D Faderan's' review below: Her review is not for this book (GoldenGate) but rather for another of Alistair MacLean's books known as 'The Golden Rendezvous'. Of the two books, 'Golden Rendezvous' is easily superior, though I like both."
5,A terrific nonstop read,"One of the best, authentic to the core, great writing, characters, you're really ""there""...FABULOUS! Sidenote: Kudos to the smart Hawaiian publisher that brought this book out, I can't believe some ""major"" NY publisher missed this book...and what a terrific mass market paperback this was born to be. What idiots!"
2,description needs improvement. says it fits John Deere 54 inch mower decks.. It only fits some decks.,The description is not accurate enough. It leads you to believe these blades fit all John Deere 54 Inch mowers. It cost me $14 to return the blades. the seller refused to pay return shipping. despite his poor description of the product.
3,Urghhh,I thought this book was okay. It was not what I expected and I was mad at the end.***SPOILER***I was angry that Leo went and slept with a woman and then proposed marriage the next morning. I mean he insulted Allegra by telling her about it and he went straight into the library when he got home to sulk and it mentioned that he still smelt like the alcohol so that means he was kissing Allegra and proposing to her after sleeping with a whore and she accepted him. That is just...URGHHH!!! Pickins could have had him just go to gaming hells and then propose to her or have it done a few weeks later. It was classless and disgusting.
4,book,"Ok story line. I have no idea why Amazon requires so many words to submit a review, it's very irritating."
5,Excellent sourcebook for teaching college history,"This well edited text brings students the documents behind the stories they may have read in high school textbooks. How did the Spanish conquer the spectacular city of Tenochtitlan with so few soldiers and in alien territory? The documents tell how they exploited alliances that were already in place. With hundreds of Tlaxcalan warriors accompanying them, housing them, feeding men and horses alike, the group of Spaniards was able to approach Tenochtitlan, make themselves unwelcome, and barely escape from the city alive... A fascinating read."
3,AND YOU THINK YOUR BUZY ?,"THIS BOOK ABOUT SEVERAL WOMEN AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS IN EDUCATION IS VERY INTERESTING ! WOMEN FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE.BORN FROM 1787 TO 1875 THESE WOMEN DIDN'T SLOW DOWN ALL THEIR LIVES. HOW THESE LADIES ACCOMPLISHED ALL THE WORK AND COLLECTING MOST OF THE MONEY ,I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND. WONDERFUL ! THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK WITH MINI BIOGRAPHIES ABOUT 6 WOMEN ... THIS IS NOT AN E.R.A. BOOK , BUT DOES MENTION THAT A COUPLE OF THESE WOMEN WERE CONCERNED ABOUT SUFFERAGE. A MUST FOR THE HOMESCHOOL FAMILY WITH DAUGHTERS."
5,excellent,this book was sooooooo cool. and it taught me a lot too. oh and by the way not only 9-12 ages can read anyone can
5,"""Man""datory reading for students of all ages...",This book opens doors to discussion with it's flowing prose and evocative stance. Shake 'em up Mary! Pure Lust is skillfully wrought and well worth the time to track down out of print copies! (Yes! They are out there! You may want to order two copies as you will surely have one copy out on the rounds on permanent loan.) My lovely edition was the only item stolen from a women's locker room- best wishes to she who has it now- please pass it on... Enjoy!
3,Meh,"smaller than I expected, not very fluffy and feathers are equivalent to those in a craft store, I was expecting higher quality"
2,"american wilderness was vast and wild, this book's neither","Too many years, too many characters, stretched over too few pages. This book had a lot of potential, but fails everywhere. The story feels plotless and plodding to a dull beat. He provides nothing with which the reader can feel or identify with the time period. The characters are poorly written. The frenchman does not feel french. The scot does not feel scotish. None of the characters have any depth because the author doesn't give them any room in which to grow before the reader or the attention they need. And the author wanders too much over the pages. Literally runninig a historical tour through the period at light speed, without giving the reader any time to feel or see what is going on. Indeed, the reader is given very little to see. No descriptions of the area, people, cloths, dwellings or anything of any kind. A few brief parts make nice short stories, but that is the best that can be said of this book."
2,"Good idea, not-so-good execution","Coyle's work for me has been very inconsistent. From the laughable Team Yankee to the believeable Sword Point, Savage Wilderness was a book I started with high hopes and finished it somewhat disappointed. My biggest complaint is the grafting of 20th century values onto the main character, an exiled survivor of the '45. His hatred of the Crown is odd, considering most of the Scots that settled in the New World were Loyalists, being defeated at Moore's Creek Bridge in 1775. The combat scenes were well done, and the characterization of a British officer in an ""unfashionable"" regiment was not bad, but the other bits left me disappointed. I'd like to see more good fiction on the F&I RevWar period, but so far I've not been impressed by any of the more recent stuff, except Thomas Fleming's _Liberty Tavern_."
4,An entertaining epic . . .,"Continuing his successful transition from modern techno-thrillers to historical fiction, Harold Coyle has turned in a solid effort in ""Savage Wilderness,"" a novel of the French & Indian Wars. This novel is entertaining not just for flint & powder history buffs, but for anyone even with a remote interest in this romantic, bygone era.With a sweeping scope, well-sketched characters, and finely tuned action scenes, ""Savage Wilderness"" is a true epic. ""The Last of the Mohicans"" this is not, but that doesn't mean a great movie can't be adapted from it."
3,What happened to the ending?,"Having read (and enjoyed) several of the author's previous books - particularly the Civil War duology - I looked forward to this novel. After an interesting start & middle, which appeared to be building up to an excellent climax, the story just appeared to fizzle out. OK, we found out (sort of) what happened to the French & British officers and the Scottish refugee, but the Indian brothers seemed to disappear into thin air, and the latter elements of the campaigns and battles where only covered in a sketchy manner. It felt like we were being prepared for a sequel; is this the case?"
3,What to say..... (3.5 stars),"First, it is really just less then a four star book. Coyle must have done a tremendous amount of research for this one. Some of the settings and characters are truly well done. This time period in America (prior to the Revolutionary War) is not real familiar to a lot of folks. This book presents this time very well. It is part history lesson, part action/romance.At times Coyle was a little long winded when setting up the next scene. But, if you pay attention, you will learn something new about the history of the United States. George Washington make several appearence as a young man in the Colonial Militia. Times were hard back then. Especially on the frontier. The frontier extended all the way out to the Ohio River Valley. A lot of the middle of the book takes place in what they called the Wilderness.I can reccommend this book."
3,Not as cute as the photo,"I bought 3 of the grey Georgie Lanky cats and the workmanship on the faces is not consistent with the photo representation. The faces on all 3 that I received were wider and flatter looking and the ears on two of them were placed low on the head and would not stand up properly. If they had looked like the photo, I would be happier with them."
5,One side or another?,"The title definately underscores how masterful Mr. McMurray has been in detailing the main differences between the Army of Northern Virginia and The Army of Tennessee. From the basics of command on through key strategy and deployment, both armies are beautifully dissected by McMurray's research, mirrored with an easy to understand style of writing.This book not only discusses how important the upper command structures were to both armies but how the various infrastructures such as railroads, food supply, communication and weapons production differed from east to west.This book can be summed up as an impressive literary study of the two great armies. It sheds light on the many differences as well as similarities and gives the reader new insight into the complex study of military history.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in an intense study of both armies.Well done Mr. McMurray!"
4,Interesting contrast between two armies,"Mr. McMurry's purpose in writing this book was to try and explain why the Army of Northern Virginia was so successful, and why the Army of Tennessee so awful. Although I did not agree with some of his conclusions, he does provide some compelling evidence to support his arguments.I found this book to be very informative, and an easy read. I recommend it for anyone looking to better understand how the South fought the war, why the two great rebel armies had such different levels of success on the battlefield, and possibly why they did not have the ability to win the war."
4,first times a blast,would be a five out of sheer talent however after the third time we listened - it became a bit too much.
5,One of my FAVORITE Books!,"I absolutley loved this book! Five children named John, Susan, Barnaby, Abby and Frederika find a book at the library that combines their real lives with their favorite books. My favorite chapter is, of course, ""Losing It,"" in which the children meet the little girl and baby from ""Half Magic""! They have their way with the magic and thwart it, and the magic has its way and thwarts them, just like in any good Eager book. Needless to say, next to Half Magic, I think this is Edward Eager's BEST book. Shame he didn't live long enough to write a sequel to this one, too."
4,A fun book.,"""Seven Day Magic"" is the last of Eager's children's fantasies, and after the previous two ""good for you"" books (""Magic or Not?"" and ""The Well-Wishers"") it's a welcome return to his earlier light and funny style. It doesn't approach the sublime fun of his first four books, but it's quite enjoyable nonetheless, and the idea of entering into your favorite books is an alluring one. Overall, not Eager's best, but well worth reading."
4,Magicaly Awsome,This book is about five kids with a magical touch. I would recommend it to kids in the 4th to 7th grade. I totaly liked this book because it kept me on my toes.
3,"They are what they say and show they are,","Stylish? No. Functional? Yes. These relaxed double knee jeans are relaxed and double kneed. They are comfortable and suited for my purpose of having an ""emergency pair of jeans"" to keep in my car in case of need. The visible stitching of the double knee (as shown in the illustration) precludes their use, for me, as daily jeans. But for an emergency? Perfect."
5,Great umbrella!,Recently got one and absolutely love this umbrella! I was pleasantly surprised at the sturdy build quality. So far it has been producing great light. If you need an umbrella i would highly reccomend!!
3,Good not great,"The item is well made and ""feet"" in the design keeps the screen off the counter when you put it down and that is a very, very good feature. The item is easy to clean as it does not have too many nooks and crannies.The part that I wish was different is the mesh. It is not fine enough to catch all the splatter. Don't get me wrong it does a good job. I think it would be fantastic if it had a finer mesh of the same quality.Still, compared to others I've used, this is one of the best."
5,Splatter Screen,This screen is better than some I have had. You still get a little splatter when turning the bacon etc but it really saves the cooktop clean up time. It even has little legs so you dont have to lie it on the counter and get grease all over everything.
2,Broken after about 6 months,"One of the arms connecting the handle to the screen rim has broken. We only use it occasionally, and it's stored in an out-of-the-way place, so I don't even know how it happened. I guess it's still usable, but only until the other arm breaks off. Certainly not worth $18."
3,Great but big,"Priced right but this is a big screen-13-15"" i'm sure and I don't always need this much screen"
5,High quality!,This item is very high quality and well made. All materials are heavy gauge. Has good heft and doesn't flex or warp under heat. I highly recommend this item.
4,Very Good Splatter Screen,This splatter screen covers practicly all types of cooking pans and saucers. Almost all of the splattering grease does not reach your stovetop and this is a big plus to all cookers who do not want to clean up a big greasy mess. The screen is very easy to clean with a sponge and hot soapy water. Just put the screen in your dish drainer and let it air dry. Nothing cold be more simpler.
3,Cheaply made,The plastic handles get hot. The material is cheaply made and bends easily. These might serve some purpose but are nothing great.
4,Stainless steel splatter screen,"I really like it! It is certainly big enough for my largest frying pans. It is so great not to get ""spat upon"" by hot bacon fat etc. and my stovetop remains so much cleaner. Great! I do suggest that the handle be made of something that won't conduct heat...I didn't see anything like that on Amazon....maybe I missed it.Progressive International Stainless Steel Splatter Screen"
5,Awesome. No more messy stovetop!!,"For years I had a smaller (didn't really cover my larger skillets)splatter screen that was clearly on it's last legs. It was rusting around the rim and had a plastic handle but hadn't fully fallen apart yet. I was tired of it not covering my large skillets (it is only 11 inches) therefore the uncovered part allowed spatters to escape. I love the Progressive Stainless Steel screen. It has VERY TINY mesh screen that holds in the splatters while letting steam escape. I got it 2 days ago and just used it to brown some stew meat on medium high heat. Clean stove top is what I got! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. My former screen is now sitting in the trash can. Once you use the Progressive, nothing else is good enough!"
5,"Solid construction, does the job","Stops spatters, very sturdy, very large. Unfortunately, too large to fit in my dishwasher. But if it were smaller, it wouldn't fit my biggest frying pan. Such is life."
5,I like it,The product is high quality and seems durable. i have used it about 8 times now and the finer mesh screen captures most of the splatters well. I like the feet so it can be placed on a counter without getting the counter dirty. The welds on the ring looked well done and should not break easily.
5,Best Quality and Function,"Mine is now almost two years old and it is holding up like new. Very durable, great quality. The screen mesh is very fine so all the oil splatter is captured. I also like the areas on the support that act as stands so you can set it upside-down on the counter without making a mess."
5,Durable and standing the test of time...,"After reading the reviews for splatter screens on Amazon, I decided on this one. That was a year ago. I've come back to report that I'm still happy with the choice I made and to add my voice to the others that have been pleased with their purchase. It does what it was designed to do and it does it well. I would purchase it again in a heartbeat."
5,Sturdy construction,"Well built, strong handle and brace. Well worth the couple extra dollars to get one that should last a long time."
2,Not good,Metal arms are soldered to frame . Solder should not be used and mine melted on one side so I then welded it back. Which is what should have been done if it was made right.
2,Scorched at high heat,"I received this a gift, and tried it out on a 12 inch lodge skillet, using a 10k btu gas burner on high heat, the splatter screen scorched immediately at the overhang of the screen.The progressive screen replaced a silicone screen that finally wore out, but that silicone splatter screen took years of this same treatment before falling apart. I would assume any of the metal screens probably cannot handle this level of heat. I'm going to try the silicone Starfrit 93038 Silicone Splatter Screen and return this one."
4,entertaining big band stuff.,"it's kind of misleading to present this music under john coltrane's name. these are actually a couple of recording dates from 1957 that john coltrane plays on, but does not lead. one of the sessions is an art blakey big band session (fine by me), and the other main session has donald byrd, oscar pettiford, and philly joe jones as members. all good, very likable stuff; but not really a coltrane set. if you are a jazz fan, i still recommend this music. it is fun stuff. people just might want to know its true nature before picking up a copy."
4,Good playin' by Trane AND others,"What I like about this disk is that Trane's playing is so definitely Trane, complete with the clear beginnings of sheets of sound, AND it's in a very unusual big band setting. It's clearly Blakey's band, and he and Donald Byrd are excellent. But I listen 'cuz it's Trane.Not a five, but I'd give it an extra 1/2 star if I could."
1,Only fits some laptops,"We bought this lock to use with a new 13.3"" MacBook. Unfortunately, it doesn't fit properly in the MacBook's security slot. It did fit into the security slot of some older laptops, but we're going to have to buy one from another maker in order to secure the MacBook."
3,Keeps honest people honest.,"I was rather disappointed with how easy the piece that connects to the PC is able to be cut through when we lost the key, didn't take 5 seconds with a drummel."
3,Works after modification,"This lock seems to work fine now. As delivered, the part that fits into the laptop security slot did not close enough for the lock to fit. I filed the part down a little to enable it to close properly. I don't know if the part was manufactured too wide to fit or if my laptop slot was too narrow."
2,macbook issue,"As stated above, the widget does not fit well in a macbook pro (at least, the 2009 version).But after some wiggling and squeezing I was able to get it in. I've decided to keep using it since I won't have to do it every day. However, I really don't like the product. Unlike the twisty kind, the padlock design takes some effort to lock and unlock (even without the incompatibility problem), and it sticks out more into the mousing region of my desk. It is probably more secure this way but it's a pain to use."
1,Doesn't Fit on Asus Eee Net Book,"Bought this for my Toshiba Laptop and it fits fine but it will not fit without forcing keyboard up on my new Asus Eee Net Book. I am not convinced these security cables would deter even the most amateur ""five finger discount"" artist.ASUS Eee PC Seashell 1005HA-MU17-BK 10.1-Inch Black Netbook - 8.5 Hours of Battery Life (Windows 7 Starter)"
2,Didn't fit my laptop!,"I have a Toshiba satellite 13"" and was really disappointed that this lock didn't fit my laptop. The lock wouldn't close all the way, so I couldn't fully lock it. I had to return it and am still looking for a laptop lock."
2,Doesn't work with 15 inch macbook pro,This cable and lock seems like a good quality of cable but it doesn't work with macbooks as the other reviews say. Mac owners stay away! Should work well for everyone else though
3,Decent lock,"I have two notebooks, an HP and a Macbook. I bought this for the HP, which is quite a large/heavy notebook, and it's a fine lock. For the Macbook (13''), other reviews are correct, it is a bit too large, and will fit awkwardly when forced.I'm happy with it, though."
1,Belkin Return Policy not customer-friendly,"I ordered this product and got it quickly, as typical for Amazon. The cable and lock unit look very solid....only one problem....the keys provided in the package do NOT open the lock. In fact, they won't even fit the lock, so it's totally unusable. I called Belkin's tech support line, got a nice customer service rep from a foreign country that didn't speak english very well at all, and he referred me to the Belkin returns website. So here's the thing: Belkin requires you to pay for shipping of returned product, AND requires a deposit for shipping of replacement product. They also indicate that you have no more than 20 days to return the defective product, after which your credit card will be charged the full price for both product and shipping. Ridiculous."
1,No Longer Fits Apple MacBooks,"The ""pivot clamp"" does not close once inserted into my new 2010 Apple MacBook Pro laptop. So it is worthless at this time for newer Apple laptops. Works fine on my older 2006 MacBook Pro, needs update. Have emailed Belkin tech support, no response yet."
5,Awesome little toy for the price,I got this for my Niece for Christmas and she loved it. It is so soft and cute and it's little suede nose and foot pads are a really fun addition. A little smaller than I was expecting (Just slightly larger than a beanie baby.) but good quality and easy for her to carry around. Would definitely buy her another.
4,Cool kitty,"These cats are so cool and unusual compared to many items sold at any of the big chain stores. These kitties had rave reviews and big laughs Christmas morning. They are, soft, cute, made well, and Definately a unique addition to any kid's plushie collection! The black one reminds me of the dragon ""toothless"". They appear very cute in the photo but beware they do look kind of mean and have become the villains in our plushie collection! Overall just awesome!"
3,Quality Control,"The other reviews are fairly true, mine arrived with the eyes all scratched up. Totally deteriorates from the value of the gift. Really a quality control problem. The toy also had dirt and fuzz on it... my guess is that it was returned and resold to me. Thanks."
5,pretty kitty,"This is a very cute long little cat. It looks pretty much like the picture, except maybe a bit longer and more lanky in the center."
3,Cute Cat - but no tail?,This cat is cute - but it has no tail? The picture shows a tail on the cat... so maybe mine is a dud. Perhaps I should have realized this before I took off the tag. Oh well... Just check yours before you remove the tag!
4,"hard to find?,,,",Had to look for this guy for a while but worth the wait very cute I may get the whole set.
2,Not Worth The Price,The cars are great as are the racing scenes but the production of the film seemed like it was made as a high school project. I don't know how they can charge $34.00 for it. Someone should make real documentary.
3,GREAT VINTAGE FOOTAGE,"As mentioned, the great vintage race footage of these beasts is worth the purchase alone. Great coverage of the early years, but I must agree,the later years are sparsely looked at. Possibly this should have been a two part series. Narration is good but lacks depth or technical insight to any degree.All in all, a great quality piece, crisp vintage footage and great sound."
2,disappointing DVD,"This DVD covers the early years fairly well, but jumps through the later years far too rapidly, and with very inadequate coverage. The DVD should have been longer, especially with more and better coverage of the 1972 and 1973 years. Overall, rather disappointing. Too bad, since this was a very special era for auto racing. The topic deserves a better effort."
4,Great dvd - damaged/poor packaging,This is just my second purchase from Amazon.com. The outer cardboard packaging looked like it had been run over by a truck tire. The plastic case that held the dvd was broken into many little pieces. Luckily the disk was not damaged. For $32 I expected sturdy packaging to protect my purchase.
5,Can Am The Speed Odyssey,"I was at Riverside Raceway, in California, opening day in 1957. So, by the time the CanAm series arrived in '66, I was already addicted to racing. The only thing I would change about this DVD is - I wish it had been even longer. It brought back many wonderful memories of some great afternoons. I would definately recommend it."
3,cd review,OK not great could have been more in depth about design evolution and not just a review of each rece and season
3,OSO easy rose,this is a tough little rose. skimpy on the height so far and not enough flowers to comment yet. I am hoping that it lives up to its name.
2,Review of Ken Andrews,"I've been a fan of Ken Andrews work for a long time and was excited to hear his new album, but was disappointed with his new work. The songs didn't give me the sensation of hairs standing up on the back of my neck. Each song sounded exactly the same. I don't know what's going on but to me he seems to have lost his passion in his song writing. Honestly his new CD is good for a few listen and then you put it on the shelf for a year or two then you go back to it and listen again and relize why you put it on the shelf in the first place."
3,"Good book, but not worth the price","Great story, and great series, I highly recomend it. However, the text is now public domain, and is avalible (for free) from Project Gutenberg (www.promo.net/pg/). The current list price of $89.00 is just too much when you can legaly take the Gutenberg version to your local printer and have it for about $5.00"
5,Awsome,This book helped me on the history and learing the Morse code. This would help all ages in my oppinion!This book dwfiitaly gets five stars!
4,Hogan's Heros. Still my Heros!,A blast to the past. Enjoy the comic antics of these prisoners of war. A nice addition to our video library.
5,A surprising and intriguing book.,"For anyone who remembers Johnny Ray and Miss Kilgallen of What's My Line fame, this story is a must read. Not only will it create nostalgia for a different time, it opens a surprising window for the reader to peep through.The fact that Johnny Ray and Dorothy Kilgallen had an affair is only the beginning of the surprises in this book.The husband and wife team of Bonnie Hearn Hill and Larry Hill have created a fascinating work revealing an unknown side of two celebreties of a past era."
5,When failure was funny,"I'm not too proud to admit that I started reading this book purely for the schadenfreude. Dreamers whose bold visions go wrong are a reliable source of humor. What surprised me was that I actually felt uplifted by Banvard's Folly. Mr. Collins doesn't go for the cheap shot here. He treats his subjects with affection, as much for their foibles as their nobility. It reminded me of someone who once said of Jeff Koons that it was impossible to tell whether or not he was making fun of his subjects. I think that Collins truly appreciates these characters, even as he chronicles their catastrophes."
2,Check connections!!,"The product I received was different from the picture. Instead of the dial-switch, it has two buttons. That's fine with me.What's not fine: the plugs. This device needs 2 USB-A male plugs (for the PC's) and 1 USB-B male plug. If you want to hook up a printer to two PC's, you will need 2 USB-A male (that's what you plug in your USB port on you PC, but this cable needs that plug on BOTH sides) and one USB-B male (also on BOTH sides). These cables are very uncommon. I had to order conversion adapters (cheaper than 3 new cables). Check your cables before ordering!!I cannnot comment on the product itself yet, because I'm waiting for the converters."
2,Not as shown in advertisement.,"The advertisement shows a switchbox with a rotary switch. The one I received is push button. Not what I ordered or wanted.It is workable, but I don't like it."
3,Great idea ruined by usurious cost,"Kudos to the people who manufacture this wonderful product! Of the sushi flash drives, this is probably the most beautiful. But for anyone to charge $50 for 1G of storage - especially when it would cost so very little to provide 8G, or even 4G, of storage - is simply a deal-breaker. When the price goes down, or the storage goes up - that will be the time to buy this great form+function marriage."
2,Very weak,"I own several Photflex items and I am generally happy with them. This light panel is just too weak to use on location and the connection method is too flimsy even inside a studio. You have to insert it into half-diameter tubes that snap around it and hold it from moving by friction. Any small movement of the light stand can yank the panel out of the holder. Also the frame is always bending out of shape.You get what you pay for, if you seek quality this panel will disappoint you."
1,Nothing like the real thing,"The original is ""untouchable""; the beats, the mood, the whole banger was off the chain. This remix is generic and has nothing special... Gza doesn't seem to flow with the beats and the whole thing sounds like it was a spar of the moment thing. Why Muggs and Gza agreed to this is beyond me. Like U2 said,""nothing like the real thing..."",and the original IS the real banger!"
4,They cry too!,"I read the book ""They Cry Too!"" years ago and it has always stuck in my mind as an unique book. It explains what pastors and their wives go through. It shares about relationship problums they have with relating to getting close to people in the church. But it also tells us as a congregation how to help pastors and their wifes feel loved in the body of Christ."
4,Dreaming in color,"I didn't just read Dreaming in color, I moved in and walked the hall ways of school again."
3,The Friendship and The Gold Cadillac,I read the book The Friendship and the Gold Cadillac. It is a great book! It is about black and white (race.) Also how people should be treated. When I read this book it gave me some feelings. The book is sort of a short book. It also made me want to keep on reading it. I think you would enjoy it alot!Jordana
3,"customer service five, product, three","I ordered this umbrella because it matched another one that I already had. When I received the umbrella it was broken in two places. Because I needed to use it immediately I rigged it back together and it served the intended purpose. One non-essential piece of the umbrella (a plastic tip) is still missing but it doesn't affect usefullness.After posting a poor review of the product the company contacted me by phone within three hours. The concerned representative offered to send an additional umbrella at no charge or refund full price. Since I could use another one I chose to do that. A few days later the representative called again and said that the other umbrellas had the same problem so they would be refunding the entire cost and I should keep the defective (but still usable) product. He also explained that they would no longer be selling this item.Excellent customer service but poor product condition. Note: not quality, condition."
4,Good Buy Christmas,"If you are looking for headphones that relatively inexpensive, comfortable and has good quality sound, these are the one. I use them quite frequently and they are great."
2,Where's tha beef?,"I thought I would upgrade to HD headphones from a pair of SENNHEISER HD280's, BOY WAS THAT A MISTAKE! The extra hi frequency range and lower response was what attracted me to the flame, and it burned!Worst feature:-There's no kick in the bass, and if I tried to max it out, it just distorted the track.-It's got SCREAMING hi's and very weak lows. Not what I was hoping for AT ALL!Best feature:they're cheap (U get what u pay for!)Soooo, I just bought a pair of Sennheiser HD-555's a sec ago. Hope they sound better than the 280's(from what I've read they do)"
2,why was my review removed?,"I put a 2 star review for these phones up. It was published for a while, and now it's been removed. The better reviews have not been removed. Why?"
2,A true reason why they were on sale,"Bought these the day after Thanksgiving sale on Amazon for a great price of 30 dollars in comparison to the original price of over 130 dollars. Got headphones and was not impressed with the sound quality of these headphones. Very low bass and as it is noise cancelling, it also acts as a mini-speaker since it protects so loudly when off the ears. Also within 7 days, the right phone stopped working and I had to send off to Sony Service Center to get fixed. The good thing is that that was a very fast turnaround. Final thought, dont purchase if you are a true audiophile as you will be disappointed, even at the discounted price of 30 dollars. I have had 10 headphones I was happier with."
2,Not very sturdy...,"As some others in this space have said, they are great while they last. They produce great sound and the open/closed switch seems to make a noticeable difference.The problem, which is unavoidable, is the durability. If you plan to use your headphones on a daily basis do not buy these as they will not last. I've had mine for about 3 months and the 'Y' connectors on both earpieces have both snapped in two. Since at that point I jury rigged them with tape/wire/fasteners, the small plastic pins that connect the earpieces to the 'Y' connectors have all snapped off so they are now practically useless.The bottom line: heavy use of headphones requires metal as plastic WILL give out."
2,Adequate sound. Flimsy construction,The sound quality is ok. The bass is a bit weak. But the plastic broke inside of 6 months and then one side went dead. Not worth it.
2,"Decent sound, but uncomfortable and expensive","I bought these headphones yesterday from a store, and I am not very impressed. I actually paid $100, and I thought for the price they would be great headphones. I was surprised when I first put them on at how small the ear holes are. There is barely enough room for my whole ear to fit inside, but the edges of the padding are pressed against my ear, and it is uncomfortable. And I don't even have big ears.The ambient sound switch is retarded, it does nothing.Sound is good, but I want a more comfortable pair."
2,Buy some duct tape,"these headphones are a complete waste of money.the headband is connected to the earphones by plastic and within two weeks both sides completely snapped and wiring started to come out from the ear phones.on the plus side though, the sound is really goodit's not worth it though and now i need new headphones.don't buy these"
3,Good for $30 - discomfort,"Quick ReviewPros:Good clean qualityPortable, look coolOnly $30-$40 on amazoncons:Bright soundHard clamp on the head, can become uncomfortable and even cause headaches after 20-30 minutes.So-so build quality, may break easily.Definitely worth $30, probably not more than $60, due to the discomfort.The triports sound slightly better and are much more comfy."
3,Nice but not the best.,"Wife has some bose headphones. I thought I would save a few bucks and try these. Yes, they are a great deal, they sound fine but they are no comparison to her bose. So if you looking for something that is fine but not worry about them getting broken or stolen. They will do."
4,One of the best spaghetti westerns,"Profound, atmospheric, great soundtrack, thoughtfull. Did I mention the ending? There are so many reviews on this movie that the ending is hardly a surprise. But even though you may read about it you have to see it to believe it. Not just a political statement which may reflect on the continuing history of man's cruelty to man as dictated by the powers that be, and the laws of the land, but darn good storytelling and entertainment. -1 star because it does not offer any solutions to it's premise. 5 stars will be given to the American remake that inspires rather than disheartens the soul; that offers some solutions and stirs some positive emotions. You know what they say: If you are not part of the solution ... Maybe a movie with Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman as the good guy and the bad guy. Very original and a must see nevertheless. Hollywood take notes."
4,"5 Star Movie, 3 Star Transfer","A great and classic movie. One of the finest Spaghetti Westerns ever, if not THE finest, with an unforgettable and unexpected conclusion.The transfer, however, leaves much to be desired. I applaud Fantoma for taking the time to transfer it in the first place. That said, this film should really be restored. They have the original 35mm for goodness sake so why not use all our greatest moderm tools to do this film justice? Somebody needs to obtain the rights for this and do a complete restoration. I'm looking at you Blue Underground!"
3,Definite European Western,"As a big fan of the Clint Eastwood trilogy, and a fan of European films, I greatly looked forward to this movie. The other reviews do it justice, and I did enjoy it.I'll concisely wrap up the pros and cons here:Pro: WONDERFUL soundtrack; beautiful scenery and a good quality picture, and a love making scene that was quite daring for its time, when you consider mixed race relationships, and society's opinion of them in the 60s.Cons: Dubbed, which usually isn't a good thing. An ending that I would have wanted to be different, but then again, I'm not the director.Probably the one thing, referring back to the Pros, is the romantic interlude. It was very touching and although not very flawlessly done, possessed a wonderful tenderous, accompanied by a fantastic score.If you're a die hard Spaghetti western fan, I would recommend it.It's not my favorite western, but a good one, and a much different one."
2,ONE OF THE BEST WESTERNS EVER MADE - RUINED BY TOTALLY INEPT DVD TRANSFER,"(MOVIE RATING: 5 / 5)THE GREAT SILENCE is without a doubt one of the best westerns ever made, mostly because of its brilliant and (at that time) very controversial ending and gripping story in general.Unfortunately ANCHOR BAY didn't hold the rights THE GREAT SILENCE, some no-name label does. The result is a horrible DVD transfer: non-anamorphic 1.66:1 presentation, which means if you're watching it on a widescreen TV, you're gonna have horizontal AND vertical black bars. French and newer UK prints feature anomorphic presentation.This edition only has the English dubbed track, not the original Italian track as the UK print does. Sorry, but the original language track is a must on any DVD!Uncut and All Regions."
3,Odd Looking Presentation,"I've wanted this title for awhile now. It's viewable, but has some bizarre looks at times. There are several points in the film that the film almost look like it was shot through a mesh of some kind. This can be annoying. Could be the print. Sound is okay for the age. This is an acceptable purchase till some care is put into a remastered blu-ray, which is highly unlikely."
5,Best ST recording in the Alpha Quadrant,Great collection of Star Trek series and Movie themes; only a KlingonOpera is missing.
5,A new way to look at the Christmas story,This is a great book to own because it gives you new perspective on the Christmas story. If you are a writer you will enjoy how Janette breaks the story down into all of its' parts.
3,Mostly OK,"You need a SERIOUS stand to hold a 43"" reflector/disc with out tipping. Bring sand bags. Of course, this means the rig is much less portable/movable which is likely a reason you bought the thing in the first place."
5,This is THE holiday CD you need,"Tried and true, I've made quite a collection for myself of these newly fashioned holiday CD's and there is no doubt, this one is the best. I have Christmas Remixed, I have Reindeer Room (1 and 2), I have them all pretty much. I like parts of the others, but I LOVE this one from beginning to end."
4,A nice change from the usual holiday music,"Fresh, new spins on holiday favorites. Uplifting and fun without being noisy. I actually found it relaxing, put me in a good mood."
2,Murky waters,"I, too, missed the first edition of this book and combed used book stores for years in vain. When I heard Pools was being reissued, I was delighted and preordered. When it arrived, I sat outside in bright light for my first look, expecting to be dazzled, but was sorely underwhelmed. Over the years, I have noticed lousy printing in many of Rizzoli's books and this might just be the worst. Page after page, what should be vibrant images are overly dense or dingy and end up looking sinister instead. The shadow areas are often completely black. The whole book looks like it took a gloom pill. I feel for Kelly Klein. She's done a great job of assembling a fascinating collection of images which are mostly drowning in too much black ink."
3,A shame the pictures are all so dark.. doesn't compare to 1st edition.,"I was excited to see this has been reissued, as the first edition copies cost several hundred dollars. Well I can see now why the 1st edition continues to bring top dollar. If you get a chance to see the pictures in the 1st edition and compare to this one, you will be highly disappointed. Pictures which were bright and cheery, turned out gloomy and look like they were taken at night with poor lighting. I really wanted to love this book, but I just couldn't get over the poor printing. If you haven't seen a 1st edition, you might not care, but if you have, you may be quite disappointed like I was. Guess I will have to save up and splurge for a 1st edition. The good thing is this only costs about 5-10% of what a good 1st edition copy sells for."
5,An elegant and soothing read,"This book is like getting a massage for your eyes. Its photos range from anecdotal to iconic to escapist, and span several time periods and social classes. The foreword by (who else?) Esther Williams is an excellent treat. My coffee table would be bare without it."
1,"Fell Short, Very Short","Kelly Klein explains that she was inspired to create a comprehensive design reference for those wanting to complement their own backyard with a swimming pool. While the book does provide dozens of interesting and beautiful photographs of pools, water and people, it provides little, if any, inspiration for those hoping to design their own oasis. There are dozens of books that offer better photographs and design ideas for modern backyard swimming pools. In addition, there are thousands of photographs on the internet that would offer more help than most of those shown in Klein's book.If you are desperately looking for a coffee table book, you may find this one appealing. Personally I think there are dozens, if not hundreds, of better collections of photographs. Other than the quality of the paper, this pretentious volume wouldn't warrant a $12.00 price tag."
3,Hmmmm,"Good for the price. However I'm not sure it's genuine.Hardlex crystal?? 1'st week it got scratched on a wooden surface...Oh and the days of the week; Mon, Tue etc are in Arabic as well as english. On the whole is it worth it for the $170 odd you pay? Look around. There are plenty to choose from here. It was a gift and as far as I know the person I got it for, has had no problems with it, and is happy."
5,I love my watch,"I have owned my watch for about a month and so far it is everything I had hoped it would be - and as long as I wear it daily it keeps accurate time. It is comfortable and easy to read and a nice surprise was that the dial illuminates in the dark . It arrived very nicely packaged and with the finish covered with removable ""tape"" so it was without blemish."
4,comfort,Sandals are quite comfortable. I played 9 holes with no problems. The next time I wore them I played 18 holes and half way through I started getting raw spots on the inside of both feet where stiching on the straps wear. Hopefully my feet will toughen up or stiching will need to be covered. Good fit and soft springy bottems make for nice comfort.
1,Breathtakingly tendentious collection of lies and distortion,"Never have so many lies and so much distortion and misrepresentation been packed into such a small space. Anyone who actually read what Marx wrote and is thoroughly familiar with the facts will be astonished at the various fictions and spin assembled in this book. Nowhere does Weyl mention any of the innumerable statements or actions which resoundingly disprove his thesis. Of course, if you don't care for the truth and just want to seem to know what you're talking about, this is the book for you. This is probably the most expensive bathroom tissue available. Anyone interested in knowing the truth should read Nimtz book on Marx, Tocqueville and Race in America."
4,Work's Fisk Jubilee songs,"Good singing, good sound, and I am pleased that this is available. I am thinking about purchasing another one soon."
2,Fair to poor audio quality,"Good selection of spirituals, but ...The product description does say 'remastered collection sang [sic.] at Jubilee Hall in the early 1980's', so I was not expecting digital quality. But the audio quality of the songs runs from moderate to poor. Some songs are ok, others are choppy or with skips and drops, and one is un-listenable, with several loud squeals.Too bad, because it would otherwise be a useful and enjoyable recording.I would not recommend purchasing this item."
2,Too expensive and too little flavor.,"If you live close to a Chinese market, you can find the same two products for less money. You can also find higher quality Oolong for 15-20 cents/bag (e.g. Ten Ren or Yama Moto Yama brands)... which are just as economical, since Pier brand takes 3-4 bags to reach the same richness of flavor as the others.If you tend to stick to Lipton and Stash brands, you will probably find these Oolongs refreshing and flavorful.My tea drinking credentials: I drink 3-10 cups daily and have two shelves of loose tea and 3 drawers of teabags. I prefer Oolongs to Black, Blacks to Greens, and have yet to taste a White worth the price."
5,Wu Yi Tea,Pier Mall's Wu Yi tea has caused me to lose a bit over 28 pounds. Have had to buy new clothes as a result. Nothing else has worked at all.
3,WuLong Tea,Both boxes of Tea came packaged very well. The classic has a rather strong taste to me so I cut it with lemon and add more water. Over all I do enjoy drinking them. I did not buy them for weight loss so I do not drink the tea every day. So I have no idea if they are effective for weight loss.
2,Not the real deal,"I have worn Versace Noir for quite some time, and this one that I purchased was not quite the real deal. The fragrance definitely is not long lasting like the REAL parfum. This being my signature fragrance I can tell the difference between the original and this watered down replica. Also, the gold color of the words and letters on this bottle was not the same as the bright gold color on the REAL bottle."
2,Stephen Joseph Snack Sac,"While the lunchbox is cute, it was not the quality I expected. Also, it does a very poor job of keeping food cold."
3,Cute-Just okay,"This is pretty cute, but only okay. For the price, I wish it were a bit more substantial. Love our skip hop lunch bag. Or, save the $ and get the whole foods sack for $2."
4,my baby's bag,I don't have much to say about this bag apart from that my daughter loved them and at last she's coonvinced to carry her own bag
2,good not great,"We used this for my son when he was in a 3 year old preschool class. It's very cute and easy to carry, but if there was any kind of leakage (raspberry juice, milk etc.) it was very difficult to get out. When I washed it (by hand or washing machine) the bag molded easily and began to smell. It's probably great if you aren't going to carry any kind of liquid, but it's pretty hard to clean otherwise."
2,Cute but not practical,"I bought the ladybug for my daughter who is about to attend preschool. It's really cute but the insulation is a joke and the bag closes with just one velco snap thus making it impossible to send things with the intention of them staying cold or hot. It's also quite small, even for a 2.5 year old."
3,fun lunch box,"It is fun and cute but not very practical. If you are trying to put containers or something to stay cold. My granddaughter uses it more as a carrying bag for books, etc."
4,Soul Glow,"I'm admittedly biased, I know Mark Prescott personally. I find him to be one of those rare individuals who exhibits what I call ""soul glow"". He has a striking, poised physical appearance, but more imortantly, you can close your eyes and still feel his radiant presence & kindly warmth. This depth of spirit is also manifested on ""The Spirit of Midnight Love"". It's somewhat challenging to believe that someone so young could write with such clarity & insight. This music is not pop ""flavour du jour"" as is the case with much of America's market driven disposable goods. No this album is a young wine with a future, that will gently ripen into a fine vintage that will be appreciated for generations to come..."
2,Not as advertised,"Closer attention should be paid to ensure the product is an actual match to the advertised description, This is only half of what it states it is."
5,Treasured Fantasy,"I started out this book cause I just simply like a story about unlikely love, especially one spiced up with abduction :))What a fantastic read!! It exceeds my anticipation!!Just love the way it started, flowed in an unusual beauty-beast love and the ending. YOu can say you have read a complete cycle after you read it although there are more sequel to this (which I'm looking forward to buy, yes, buy).I don't have the heart to bring what's inside. Just read it yourself. Really, this is A truly treasured book for keep."
5,My first child will be Marak,I loved this trilogy. Taking a mythical creature such as a goblin and turning it into a lovable character is not an easy task in literature. The goblins in this trilogy are defined as grotesque and scary but due to their attitude and comportment I found myself wanting to name my son after the king of the goblins (if and when I have a son that is!).I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the Hollow Kingdom and will be revisiting it soon as well as often.
5,GREAT,This was the best book I've ever read!!!!!! It was great!!!!!! You've gota read it!!!! IT'S GREAT!
5,Just Couldn't put it Down!!,"If you expect all fantasy to have Tolkein-esk elves - all wise and beautiful - and goblins that are the worst nightmares to come out of Weta Workshops, then this book will be a new surprise for you! Set in early Victorian England, this novel sweeps you off into a new realm of unlikely loves and even more unlikely heros. I don't want to give the story away, but I can't praise it enough: engaging, funny, keep-you-up-till-2am-because-I-have-to-know-what-happens-next wonderful! You'll love Kate, the leading lady who DOESN'T faint at the first sign of spookiness or trouble as well as all the fantastical creatures that become a part of her life! Huzzahs for Ms. Dunkle and her amazing fantasy!"
4,"Out of Stock, but fast refund and great communication","This company has super communication and fast refunds. Unfortunatley the gift I ordered was out of stock, so it was not quickly removed from the marketplace when the stock was depleted. But I trust this company to be straight-up and honest. I wouldn't skip buying from them again."
5,the pretty things are going going gone,"Bowie in his purest form. For his first batch of singles from 'hours...', Bowie released a few new songs as bsides for the first time in ages, and they can only be obtained by either this single, or the Thursdays Child singles. While there is a pointless edit of the title track here, it is still worth picking up for one of Bowies greatest singles of the last decade."
1,This book is really bad.,"Don't waste your money on this one. It's really bad. There is little of value here and a lot of hard-core, right wing conspiracy theory. Much of the factual information is simply lifted from the NSA web site and various articles in newspapers. The rest of the book is a lot of conjecture and unsupported fiction pretending to be fact. I'm sorry I dropped my money on this one. If you really want to learn about the NSA, buy Puzzle Palace."
3,Access Las Vegas (5th Ed.),"'Access Las Vegas' was not exactly what I was looking for, but is a well rounded guide to the city and the attractions. I am a college student taking my first trip to Las Vegas, and I was looking for a guide to the sites on a very small budget. This would be a good book for someone with more of a budget to work with, and more time to spend in the city."
3,Coffe Club Orchestra,Had not heard this disc prior and expected more orchestral treatment. Was disappointed in the arrangements.
5,Rodgers and Hart's sparkling masterpiece,"BABES IN ARMS is given the 5-star treatment in this recording of the 1999 City Center's Encores! production. The renowned Coffee Club Orchestra under the baton of wunderkind Rob Fisher gives the sparkling score all the brilliance it deserves.David Campbell and Erin Dilly star as the teenage sweethearts Val LeMar and Billie Smith. They offer a particularly thrilling rendition of ""Where or When"", and Dilly makes magic with her haunting version of ""My Funny Valentine"".Melissa Rain Anderson, as the vivacious Baby Rose, performs ""Johnny One-Note"" to perfection, as well as stellar readings of ""Way Out West"" and ""Imagine"" with the quartet.The Coffee Club Orchestra will thrill you with the ""Johnny One-Note"" and ""Peter's Journey"" ballet segments. The cast also features Christopher Fitzgerald and Jessica Stone. DRG Theater."
3,Sweet anecdotes of June's life and times.........,"I found this book at the library in the biography section and immediately picked it up. While not exactly a biography, it is still a good book. It contains 46 sweet anecdotes of June Carter Cash's life and times. Some from her childhood, her experiences on tour, her children and being Mrs. Cash top the list of favorite topics. She reminisces about her times with Elvis Presley and with Hank and Audrey Williams. If you can find it, this book is not to be missed!!"
2,June's anecdotes,Anecdotes from June Carter's life - this book is not quite the read I expected and I sometimes found it hard to follow.
3,From the heart,"This book would have been good to Me, but I read it too long after it had come out.. and also after I read Her sons book, which was a lot more up to date.."
1,From the Heart,"I have yet to receive my order that was placed on December 2, 2007 from Woody's Books. We are still waiting a reply as to when it will be sent."
1,This book is free on Hotpans.com by the author.in PDF format.,"I am not against people makeing money but I am against people over pricing a book that is freely accessible by the author on his web site hotpans.com(in PDF form).Dear Amazon Customers please go ahead and buy this book if your interested in learning the history, and art-form of how steel drums/Pans are made.It is a fantastic resource with scientific data collected on Steel pan/drum of Trinidad.And to these sellers on Amazon. please explaine your reasoning to the author when he finds out."
4,Great fun for kids and adults!,"This DVD is full of catchy tunes from one of Billy Jonas' live concerts. What it lacks in polish is made up by catchy tunes and fun video. My [son]loves ""bangin and sangin"" with Billy Jonas. We can't wait to catch him live this summer"
5,An excellent update on immigration for the November into December Holidays,"Perhaps it is because I lived in Newton Ma during the Russian immigration wave of the 80s,and because my own family mix is both Puritan (think Bay Colony) and recently immigrated -Thai from the 70s, Irish from the 90s , that I love this film. I used it in classrooms in an old VCR version until breakageand was THRILLED to see it on DVD. I have used this to teach immigration religious tolerance, diversity,family and school traditions etc. with students ages 8 to 12 and all have responded positively to the tale.Barbara Cohen's popular book, which we also read, is based on her aunt's experiences in the 1920s but the movieis based on post USSR American suburbs in the 1990s and Barbara Cohen herself has a walk on part asthe traffic guard. I love that it also leads into the topic of religious persecutions - Puritans, Hanukkah, JMJ's flight into EgyptBeautifully done"
1,lubrigous,"This 6 sided box sounds like fingernails on a black board. This must be some of that new ""rock"" music. Ive had quite enough honestly, we need to hear more clasic old cowboy songs on the radio."
1,This might as well be clear,"This eye shadow is the worst product I have ever bought! I can't say enough bad about it. The eye shadow is dry and rough. The colors while appealing go on transparent and come off an hour later. I really truly mean they wore off ONE HOUR after I put this on. If you want to waste your money trust the other persons review, bewared you will be here a month later giving it a bad review too."
1,Beware!,"The workout is pretty good! But this is exactly the same workout ""Pilates Standing Blend"" with Katalin Zamiar."
4,"Without Bruce, this wouldn't be a movie.",Buy it for Bruce. The most of the rest of the cast will die off. Unfortunately not all of them.
4,Bruce Campbell,Campbell plays slightly off type here as a criminal who gets thrown into an Alien Invasion plot. Surprisingly good for a low budget Sci-Fi channel movie. I bought because of Bruce Campbell and was pleased. Reccomended for all Campbell fans looking to see something a little different.
2,THE WHOLE THEORY ? OR +,"I purchased Bobby's 'Whole Theory'. The CD is different from the usual sound lapsed R&B that i've heard, recently, yet it's possible that he's the next big thing in the making. I'm kinda digging 'Serious Thang'and 'Friday Night' (sampled from N.W.A's Message To The B.A.),the rest of the material was passive. Oh, the CD cover is really cool with the costumes and the inner sleve comic work. Didn't he useta work with Digital Underground? TWO stars for the nerve to be different BUT NOT UNIQUE."
3,Stick with the ballots!,Bobby's CD 'The Whole Theory' is a fun album. Some of the uptempo songs 'Friday Night' and 'Bounce To This' were passive but didn't have the same impact as Will Smith or Ice Cube. I liked him better slow. Keith Sweat is one of my all time favorite singers and I find a hint of Sweat in the cd's slow songs like 'Stay With Him' and he showed a lot of verstility almost sounding like Jeffrey Osborne on 'Guess Who's Back In Town'. Stick with the ballots!
2,Avoid this if you have a HTC Wizard,"I have a T-Mobile MDA which is a HTC Wizard sold under various names by all the major carriers. It is A2DP compliant since it is a new phone, but it has MANY issues. In order to use it, I have to keep refreshing and saving this device on my bluetooth set up screen. The music goes in and out sometimes for 2-3 seconds. Every once in a while I can listen to a whole song w/o any interruptions. I don't know if it is a part of the connection issue, but some of my songs play slower than normal like the battery is dying when it is fully charged. When I do switch to a call coming in or out, the other person can barely hear me. It's best to try this out a brick and mortar store so you can return it easily if yours works like mine. I almost forgot, the clip is so weak that it can not tightly grip onto your shirt or anything for that matter so it keeps falling off."
5,I liked it very much,"From what I hear, these guys are friends of Faith No More's Jim Martin and Danzig's John Christ. All metal fans must have this album. If you like these guys, also pick up ""Anand Bhatt and Jim Martin - Conflict."""
3,missing pieces - team 31 no good,"These are very nice puzzles. My problem is I have put together 4 of them now and two with slips inside saying team 31 have missing pieces. So no, it hasn't been the fun of other puzzles. I expect a piece or two missing from a thrift store puzzle, but not something like this. I have emailed the company and will see if they replace them or not."
5,Another brilliant album from Fangoria,"Naturaleza Muerta is definitely one of Fangoria's best works, and it's my (second) favorite album of theirs. Nearly every one of the songs on the album is absolutely brilliant. I try to tell everyone I encounter about Fangoria, because it is horrible how unknown they are outside of Spanish-speaking countries, and they deserve a lot more credit than what they are given. My favorite tracks on the album are ""Hombres,"" ""Amo El Peligro,"" ""Ese Hombre,"" and ""Un Austronauta Solo, Flotando."" If you're a fan of darkwave, industrial, or even all-around dance music I suggest you give Fangoria a try. Their sound basically covers all ends of the spectrum. You won't be disappointed."
3,In the Shadow of the Alamoby Sherry Garland,"I needed this book for my daughter's class. I have not read the book, however it should be noted that I count on Amazon to have what I need in a hurry when teachers drop a due date and parents scramble to get the books. Most of the time local stores are sold out of the book and that is why Amazon saves me the trouble of tracking down what I need.Thank you."
4,Good smooth and mellow Brazilian Jazz !!!!,"Ricardo is back after long 6 years since his previous CD; this time he seems more reflective and introspective,full of vituosity as always but more americanized and less brazilian; this time he is joined by long-time friends and awesome musicians like Armando Marcal,Carlos Balla and Gilson Peranzetta. The highlights of this great CD are: 1)Lua No Mar (Moon Over the Sea); this is one of the most romantic and best jazz ballads I've ever heard. 2) Tango Carioca (tango from Rio de Janeiro), 3) Bom Partido (Good Game), 4) Ingenua (Naive) and Pais Tropical. If you like Ricardo you'll like this CD eventhough is more mellow and acoustic; nothing close to his previous three albums that reached #1 in the Jazz charts."
2,Another rush to production which should no thave happened,"+Again Doug is not at his best ...this is a very poor representation of the music He is famous for , he is capable of much better"
4,Very good...,"... but if you intend to play in diferent days with the same fill, buy a on/off switch also.The tank has a very good finish. It's lightweighted and flat bottomed instead of rounded."
5,Best Plasma Mount on the Market,If you want the top of the line plasma mount system then this is the product to buy. The mount allows the TV to extend straight out from the wall as well as turn 180 degrees in either direction. You are not going to find a more functional mount on the market. It is clearly more expensive than other mounts but you get what you pay for.
5,Greta Buy!,I sought out and bought this mount after going to my local retailers and being told that they did not have anything in stock to fit my needs. This mount came within a few days and was easily installed. I have a very deep inlet above my fireplace and therefore needed the extension and flexibility thatthis mount offers. Two years later I am still patting myself on the back for finding/purchasing this mount.
2,Not interesting,"Well I purchased this book along with some other travel guides including ""lets go Europe"" and just looking at it made me board. I traveled Europe for 3 months from London to Istanbul and I found this book of little use or interest. I think it might have to do with the type of travel I found myself doing. I was jumping on trains by the seat of my pants: buying tickets only the day before and using a 3 month unlimited ticket."
2,elementary level,"this book is useful to the elementary level cos the book has not much 'new' things to the students and/or practitioners. For those who have studied finance would find this book too simple. for those who are interested in hk property market, I would suggest another book, ""real estate in hk"" ...complied by Mr. Thomas N T Poon., published by PACE"
1,"Picture and ""fits"" info are misleading","This is not Universal and in fact it reads that it fits Jenn Air but it doesn't. Any coil cartridge for Jenn Air requires the Slot not the Hole design. These are pans withRange Kleen P10124XN Porcelain Universal Drip Pans Set Of 4 Containing 2 Units P101, P102, BlackHoles so do me NO good. The pic doesn't show which one it is...very carefully poised, I'd say, and maybe with the intent to mislead?"
1,it is not universal,"We had to go out and buy 2 large at quite a price each because they did not fit....universal...NO...beware......this product cost us a lot of money in the long run, and had two left over pieces for a thrift store!"
4,Doesn't Fit a Kenmore,"These were exactly what I wanted and looked to be of good quality. But,sadly, they don't fit my Kenmore. They were a skosh too small. I'll be returning them."
2,Not cleanable.,Not ver sturdy. Cannot clean in oven like some. I tried to soak them and finally scrub them and they did not clean.
5,A classic epic in sci-fi. I'd love to see it as a movie!,"Many stories, be they sci-fi or others, rarely span a thousand years of time. And if they do, I rather doubt they would hold the reader as spell-bound to the saga as the Foundation & Empire series has. I've read this classic three times in my life (except for the fourth book) since I was ten years old. The Mule was my first introduction to the series and I have since been captivated by the style, flow and imagination (which is not too wild) of this panorama of time and space in the dim (10,000 years from now) future. The scope of the book alone would be a challenge to write, keeping the characters and theme focused, while still providing side voyages into military, social, economic and political life in an empire the size of the galaxy. It's grander than the fall of the Roman Empire or Third Reich, as would be a galactic empire's demise. A must for anyone's library, let alone sci-fi buffs"
1,"love the subject, bored by the execution",This is a mediocre and boring show.The characters have no nuance and the actors are not helping.This is a shame. The subject is timely and engaging.I had high hopes for this series but this is no Will and Grace.Alas.
4,Great to Watch,"This show has been very great to watch. I have really enjoyed watching it, and the quality is really good. It helps me out because I don't get broadcast television so I get to enjoy great shows through Prime."
3,Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five,"Great album, unfortunately, the recording has a very low sound, the best songs are World War III, The New Adventures of Grandmaster and the Truth. This group has been one the best in the genre of rap/hip hop, were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2007, becoming the first hip hop/rap artists to be so honored!!!"
2,Wrong book information,"""That Family Circus Feeling"" is being given the book review for ""This Scepter'd Isle"" Please look into this. I now own both books and will keep them, but I was only after the Mercedes Lackey series. This is an example of the buyer's confusion.That Family Circus Feeling (Paperback)~ Bil KeaneBil Keane (Author)> Visit Amazon's Bil Keane PageFind all the books, read about the author, and more.See search results for this authorAre you an author?

5,good time crunch yoga,"I am fairly new to yoga, but find this (so far) my favorite tape. I've tried about 6 different ones. While the workout seems fairly simple, I am already noticing toned muscles and greater flexibility. The instructors are great too. I definitely find the focus more on body than mind, so if this is what you are looking for, this is a great choice. Add Firm Parts 5-Day Abs for a fast way to firm up those parts not targeted during this session."
2,Not at all what I expected,"I expected a yoga workout that really felt invigorating since it was titled strength and tone. I am a beginner, and even this was too easy for me. And the commercial breaks on a DVD - weird."
5,A Great Workout for Busy Moms,"As a busy stay-at-home-mom with two small children, I don't have time for a long workout session. The 20-minute sessions on this DVD are the perfect length. I like the blend of stretching and strengthening. After a session I feel energized and ready for another busy day!"
4,Wonderful aged Gruyere,"We first enjoyed this variety at the Gruyere Castle in Switzerland. This is very similar to what I remember from those delicious samples. Much more personality than regular Gruyere, rich, with a delightful flavor ""edge"" that distinguishes it from many other varieties.The purveyor shipped promptly in a well protected package."
5,On target,"I gave this to our daughter to use with our grandchildren. She said, ""This is so on target"". ""I love it, I have had these exact conversations with my kids!"" Also quick and easy to read when you don't have time to sit down and tackle a documentary."
5,A Great Go-To Resource,"My mother (a school counselor) gave me this book after attending a series of conferences on the Love & Logic method of discipline. The name turned me off immediately and I stashed it my bookcase without another thought. That is until I started having regular battle of wills with my 8 year old daughter. My mother told me not to call her until I at least tried to read the book, so in I dove. I read several of the scenarios and decided following their example couldn't be worse than the current arguments. And guess what? It worked!! Removing the threats & hounding and letting her logically try to work out the consequences had a much greater & faster impact than anything I could have come up with."
4,Nice rocks,These are good working rocks. They hold up well and hold alot of water. They actually float when put in water so they hold alot of air. The only bad thing is they come so dirty. They have so much powder on them you have to wash them in water before applying.
3,A mystery for me as well,"I had the same problem as Don. Shipped in clear plastic garbage bag, of course ripped, dust everywhere. Guess this must be normal"
5,Eyewitness Travel Guide to Egypt,Spent Christmas day reading this terrific book. Taking a trip there in February 2003 and have three other books on what to see. This book seems to be the best.
2,Poor switch design ruins an otherwise great product,"Lightweight, surprisingly bright for their size and really handy, thse lights would be a great buy if they didn't suffer from one fatal flaw: their switches appear to be very poorly designed or constructed.I purchaced three of these for stocking stuffers in addition to one for myself. One has already died due to a stuck 'on' switch. Mine seems to turn on if it's breathed on (VERY sensitive switch). So we're batting .500 with less than one month's use.As such, I cannot recommend these minilights."
2,New model requires button be held,"I had an older Inova keychain light from a while back, so I bought this after my older one started showing a considerable amount of wear and tear on the rubber button. The new one forces you to keep the button depressed to use the light, which makes the product nearly useless as it's not an easy button to keep depressed. I ended up swapping out the innards of my old light into the new case, but this'll be the last Inova keychain flashlight I own."
2,Far from being perfect,"Amazon was very fast, efficient and reliable.The product is a cool product, it's light, small, easy to connect disconnect to your key ring, but, it's a big one, from my understanding it's suppose to have 3 different positions, one full and strong light, the other is a weaker light and the third, a blinking light. We bought 2 pieces for me and my girlfriend, both worked strange in the begining, had only one position of pressing then having the light, when leaving the finger off, the light gets off. Mine now work fine with the 3 positions, my girlfriend one stayed the same as was, which is broken I guess."
4,Almost a 5 star,"Indeed, no more ""accidentally"" turned on by the electrostatic in my pocket. That seems to be fixed. I gave it 4 stars for light being blueish, not white enough. I have cheap LED flash light which has white light, not sure why this one is still blueish, considering it being fairly expensive at $8 for 1-LED flashlight."
3,keychain lights,These lights work quite well but are a bit too small. It's great that you don't have to hold down the button to keep the light on.
3,Just ok. Nice look but too shallow for solid pinning,The bulletin bar is descent. I bought it to hold my to do lists and reading handouts.It has got a nice look but the cork bar is too shallow for solid pinning. I would not pin more than 10 pages on the bulletin bar.
5,great starting resource,"We just received a dog from the humane society a week ago. A few days prior to getting the dog I bought this book and read about the first half. I found it incredibly helpful and informative. Most resources you read mostly have information regarding bringing home puppies from breeders, with very little about shelters. Not only did this book help calm my nerves about getting the dog, but I refer to it constantly to answer my questions that come up."
5,Hilarious,"I'm from Hawaii but my bf is not so I got him, pupus to da max, and the two pidgin to da max books for him to kind of understand pidgin when we visit my parents in Hawaii, he loves the books, they're fun to read and the pictures are hilarious."
5,"Funny, funny, funny",Great for guest. Laugh your okele off as the toons and their captions are hilarious. Good solid words and definations of island grinds [food for you haoles]. A must have for mainland locals. Warning: will make you hungry for local grinds
1,BEWARE READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY,This adapter will not work with certain drivers goto pharos website for details. I bought this product fought it for 8 hours before I figured this out and had to return it.
5,"This band is so good, its scary...","I thought they couldn't do any better than ""First Blood"". I was wrong.Without a doubt, the most jumpin' CD of any genre I've heard for too long a time. Great combination of big old Silvertone slide geetar sounds (Mike tunes down to C!) mixed with standup bass, acoustic piano and a rockin' drummer. Oh yeah, and the wicked Little Walter inspired harp is played by Mike as well...These guys are the best - when I first heard the remake of ""Wouldn't lay my guitar down"" (which appeared on Mike's CD ""Edge of Night"") I had to pull the truck over to crank the volume and avoid the speeding ticket.Hey, I'm gushing. Enough. Buy it.(And Mike, get your band out to Sydney Australia ASAP!)"
1,Not well made,Item was not very sturdy and certainly not put together well enough to keep out bugs. There is a noticable gap between the two screens and we watched a spider walk right through it on the first time we had it in. The ones we bought at lowes were much better-wish they had the bigger size!
2,It's hard to open and close,"It is a little on the flimsey side, which makes it hard to open and close. I bought it to use across the stairs to keep cats from coming down stairs. It is just okay. Not wonderful."
2,Salad bowl and tongs,"The salad bowl is okay but not what I expected as far as quality. Kind of ""cheap."". The salad tongs are terrible! They are not comfortable to use and the metal is AWFUL. Totally a ""made in China"" product."
3,Not able to ship to California?,"I never recieved this product. I was told that it was banned in my state. I was surprised that I was able to pay for something on Amazon and then told I couldn't have it? It turns out, I can get the same knife at my local sporting goods store, it just cost twice as much. They refunded my payment and the knife that I bought elsewhere is good. So 3 stars. Whatever."
5,WOW,"I just got these today and while I haven't used them yet, I was super impressed by the presentation. These impact sockets literally look and feel amazing! They TRULY TRULY feel and look so good I almost don't want to use them like someone else said but obviously I can't wait to use them to rotate my tires etc! If it doesn't perform as good as it looks (and I seriously doubt that) I will revise this post!"
4,great starter set,These are great. The only thing I dislike about them is that they do not have the sizes of the socket engraved into the metal. After a couple of uses the labeling on a couple sockets has started to come off.
2,Momiji,"This piece of mangarotica is run of the mill submissive garbage. The plot is never really explained as it opens with Momiji being forced into sex and not really resisting. she never does. The story is weak the art is average at best so unless watching the domintion of one who just accepts it is your cup of tea, dont waste your money."
5,Found this really useful,"There are complaints I read about Lidia that she doesn't give specific measurements and I thought that'd be a problem for me, but it wasn't. I followed what she did, and went with my gut on certain things. This is probably not helpful for beginning cooks, but if you have a good hand in the kitchen anyway it's actually really empowering. I've made some of the best dishes ever from using this technique. Her alfredo is truly simple and brilliant, and oh my lord, heavenly. (By the by, I used a cup of butter and 1.5 cups of cream, 2 cups of romano and parmesan)."
3,Mentoring Heroes,"Mentoring Heroes : 52 Fabulous Women's Paths to Success and the Mentors Who Empowered ThemGood Condition, good packaging, received timelyTYR"
4,"Okay, but not exactly what I was expecting",There are a host of books on the Trinity. This is easy to read and understand and a good resource. I am still looking for something better.
4,Great Dance Moves,"I love dance-based aerobics, and this video is it! Victoria has a great personality and high energy. Her cuing is good, and she breaks down the more complicated steps. She encourages you to modify the moves if you need to, and to add your own style. This tape may be a bit tricky for beginning steppers; it took me awhile to master. I do not like the toning section at the end; I would rather have had a longer cool-down and stretch. But the step portion of the workout is lots of fun; be prepared to sweat!"
5,Brilliant,Andre Previn's CD of the movie The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse is elegant brilliance. It's everything a soundtrackshould be and more!
2,Sacrilegious edition,"This masterpiece in physics is a classic that needs not introduction. Just be warned: if you are not a student without means, this book is not for you. I can't conceive how, in this age where LaTeX is widespread, such an edition could come to being. The formulae are pathetically written, the fonts are often blurry, the edition is plain cheap. I'm handing one of the volumes in my hand now: printed and bound in China... the bad way. It's better to photocopy the good editions and bind it yourself, really.I guess I would had loved these volumes when I was a pennyless student, long ago. Now all I see is a mutilation of a classic. Believe me, it can be done both cheap and well. This masterpiece _deserves_ it; anything else is sacrilege."
3,Terrible print quality.,"I have received a 2005 printing of this, and the print quality is terrible, often unreadable in complex mathematical expressions. I purchased some other books in this series about 10 years ago, and their print quality was fine. So my advice is not to buy without being able to check the print quality first."
2,"had potential, but...","When I first heard about this book, I was all agog- a murder mystery set in the art world! A murderer who stages death as art! But this book proved to be a disappointment. Santlofer shows flashes of brilliance- I thought the elaborate clues provided by the murderer were good, but after a point it was just tediously gory. Definitely a lack of character development and a lot of inconsistencies. Also an arbitrary ending- it seemed like the author found a character in the book and made him the murderer without sufficient background building. The end of a good murder mystery should make you nod in agreement and want to kick yourself for not figuring it out. This one just leaves you bewildered- it could as well have been Person B as Person A. If art is your thing, do read it, but keep your expectations low. And keep an art tome handy to look up the featured art!"
3,"Great plot ruined by materialistic, pretentious writing","The storyline of this book was wonderful--I had a hard time putting it down, but found myself skimming over some of the gag-inducing descriptions of the characters, their clothes and their fancy surroundings. With his next book, I hope the author doesn't try to fluff up the plot with designer labels and characters with ""perfectly bobbed hair""."
2,Keep Shopping,"The Death Artist certainly works as a page turner but fails to satisfy as a mystery, and the exploration of the New York art world is particularly weak (it's as if Sister Wendy decided to take up crime writing during a trip to the Big Apple). If you're looking for an art-related mystery, you should consider Iain Pears instead. Perhaps most unsettling about The Death Artist is the narrator's voice; however vague, there's something decidedly mean-spirited about it. Rarely if ever, does the reader identify or care about anyone in the book in any real way."
5,Self Growth Transformation,"If you're looking for a how to book on self growthand transformation, then this is the book for you.This book: You Hold The Key To Riches And Happiness,So What Are Your Waiting For?; is a book that hasall of these elements from beginning to finish.This is a complete book on this subject. I learnedmore from this book than any other like it."
5,Excellent Book Worth Reading,"""You Hold The Key To Riches And Happiness, So What AreYou Waiting For?"" is a wonderful book on creating yourown lasting happiness that leads you to a rich life.Very enjoyable book that is well worth reading. Irecommend another book by this author title being""Inspirational Wisdom For Love, Beauty, and Richness"".I got so involved in reading ""Inspirational Wisdom ForLove, Beauty, and Richness that I read it all the firstday I got it. There is some tremenduously amazing andprofound wisdom within this book. This is by far anexcellent book. Both books recommended for sure."
5,Self-Empowerment For Success Book,You Hold The Key To Riches And Happiness offersself empowerment solutions to gain success inlife. A good book to read and apply. The knowledgewritten in this book is tremendously helpful.
5,Excellent Book,This book is greatly helpful and useful.One of the best self-help books everwritten. Enjoyable reading at the sametime as gaining valuable knowledge. Areally good learning experience forme. I recommend this book highly.
3,"OK book.. has some good info, but not written well","This book is written too superficially, it must have more practical stuff in it for you to get used to. This would help you get an idea of what the SAP WAS is, but you would probably need something else to really start using the SAP WAS.."
4,A Good Read for the Non-Professional,"I found this book very interesting to read and to work with. I am not a professional in the area but only a student of psychology over the eyars. I have not memorized the various personality types etc. as some have who have reviewed this book.I did find it very useful to help me realize that people are different and we need to account for those differences when we are dealing with them. I have no doubt but that this book, and this knowledge helped me as a Human Resource Manager for many years, and as an adjunct college instructor for several years.For the non-professional who is interested in the differences of human personality, this is an excellent read.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,I love this book.,"The book is wonderful! It is quite beat up, but for the price, I do not regret buying this book at all!"
4,Type Talk Review,"I purchased Type Talk because I was about to take CPP's MBTI certification training, and I wanted another book to add to the materials.I think if one is going to be an MBTI consultant, it is good to have many related pertinent materials. This is one of them.Otto Kroeger, ENFJ, works exclusively with the MBTI Indicator, and Janet Thuesen, INFP, is president of Otto Kroeger Associates, a management consulting firm in Fairfax, Virginia.I purchased the book Used, and the edition is an older one that does not contain the newer Preface, but the price was right."
5,Excellent Product!,"I have made several purchases through TrueFlow.com, and they truly offer a great product. I have never had any issues, and they offer great customer service. Worth the money!"
1,SNOOZER,"I am sorry, I know that everyone else has great ratings for this book, but I could not read it! Everytime I tried my head would start to bob cause I would start falling asleep...no matter what time of day or night I tried to read it. I kept waiting for the book to WOW me like everyone talked about but it just did not happen for me. We will be discussing this book at our book club meeting next week, I am VERY interested to see if anyone made it through this book."
5,Not what I expected--better!,"I bought this thinking I would be getting a good shoot-'em-up Western, the kind I watched on TV growing up. This book has so much more depth and nuance, though. Yes, it's a product of its time, with one passage about lynching of Southern blacks that made me wince, but the book doesn't just refer to Jane Austen, it could be compared to that genre of books. It's mostly about a strong man and a strong woman, with the Wyoming plains forming a third character. Highly recommended!"
2,Only for people with very little exposure to gambling,"I found this book to be a fun, easy read but with little substance. There are too many words in between interesting facts and observations. This book is for you if you're interested in the psyche of people who gamble - maybe a better title would be ""The Culture of Casinos.""I was hoping for more insider's observations, tips, etc."
3,Great general advice,"Casino Gambling the Smart Way is a must read for both veteran and new gamblers. If you are the sort that beleives in systems, or believes that 'red is due' after a long run of black, or if you are the sort that chases your loses, this book may cure you of that. If you know better, you might still enjoy the anecdotes, which are pretty fun to read. However, don't expect much concrete advice on how to play any casino games, or much in the way of analysis of any particular games.I give it three stars: although the book reads like a disconnected set of articles for a gambling magazine, and perhaps that is where it came from, it is still worth checking out so you can avoid major losses at the casino."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this DVD looking for a slow, relaxing type of workout to supplement more strenuous astanga yoga. I was immediately put off by how loud the music was over the instructor's voice. The first pose was very uncomfortable for me (sitting on my lower legs) and I could not do these poses until I had stretched out my lower legs muscles. This ruined the continuity of the poses from the beginning. But, what most bothered me was the omission of one side of the body for the forward lunge. I could not believe that anyone would put out a DVD with such a major flaw. I have only worked with the first workout, but I doubt if I will ever put the DVD back in. I am going to buy a restorative yoga DVD that has long, slow poses with deep relaxation and I notice there are a couple of these products available here and I already have other DVDs for regular workouts."
2,pay as u go,"now im from london in england, aint no import there, ha just cant believe the price in america. it was a hottie of a song for some time but aint all that ne more. they produce some good tunes. if u dont mind parting wid cash then go ahead, worth the uk pounds.big up mental B!"
4,A car book for the dedicated fan,"The good: Setright will teach most people more about cars and technology in this book, than one could learn from reading 100 others. He uses his unique skill to focus on what is truly important technology and to ignore the waste.Setright's many opinions are worth as much as his technical details are. His impressions of things like all wheel steering and automatic transmissions are a true breath of fresh air.The bad: Those who have read Setright will know his writing is top notch. This book though is sometimes repetitive and disorganized. It feels like he may have tried to be too broad for once."
4,Sorry I waited,"We always use straws and have had a difficult time with a convienient spot. Our previous ""big baggie in a drawer"" method left a lot to be desired. When I got the idea for a straw dispenser I saw there were several on Amazon and I had a hard time picking one out. This one is light and looks great. Functionally it works well."
4,Good,"This was a good purchase. We use a lot of straws and this makes it a bit fun. I like the plastic since it is harder to break, but it does have a light, cheap feel to me."
4,Cute and handy,"I use straws everyday and came across a dispenser like this in a dept store & fell in love. It was too cute & a great way to store the straws but the price turned me off. I came across this one on Amazon & the price was definitely more appealing. Now that I have it, I am very happy. The quality isn't as nice as the more expensive one I saw. This one is more on the plain side & the dispenser itself is plastic, not glass. However, it's still very cute & a great way to store straws if you use them often. When you pull the top, the straws slide up & fan out, making it easy to grab one & slide them all back in. This also helps keep the straws clean since they are contained inside. Overall, a great deal and a nice little accessory for the kitchen you wouldn't normally think of."
1,Disappointing,"I was disappointed as this was plastic, and I thought for the price of $14.50 it was glass. Not very well made. I was able to find a nice glass one locally for $9.99."
4,Farber paring knife - a handsome tool,"I bought this as a replacement to restore the original set. Excellent balance, and a reasonable cutting edge that retains its edge well and can be sharpened easily. Good value!"
4,Hard To Find,Local chains have discontinued carrying Rack Sack Refills.I am happy to be able to get them from Amazon.
4,Pretty good for a cheapo blender,"Like most under-$100 blenders these days, the $40 Michael Graves blender from Target is made in China. It feels lightweight, and the plastic buttons have a flimsy feel to them. Also, they are hard to clean between. (Why, oh why, do 90% of all blenders use this stupid multiple-button speed control system instead of a nice, simple rotary dial?) As Stuart Gathman noted below, this is not the blender to buy if you want a rugged, heavy-duty model, but it's fine for light work and it IS stylish. (If you want something more rugged, for well under $100 you can get a good Oster, KitchenAid or Hamilton Beach model that will outlast this Graves/Target model by years.)"
5,un buen producto...,excelente producto...me llego en el tiempo estipulado muchas gracias.sigan atendiendo bien a sus clientes se les felicita por la venta.
3,Old School,My 6yr old thinks he's cool in these. They are converse and of quality. The Co. that shipped was attentive to let me know where my order was.
1,little dissapointed,The body of the music in these songs is actually good and enjoyable. I found that the songs tend to end abruptly. it is very noticeable and a bit annoying.
2,An overwritten brochure,"How can I put it nicely? I guess I can't so I'll be blunt. This book is great if you enjoy reading four paragraphs for information that can be readily conveyed in less than a sentence. I'm guessing if the authors wanted to omit all the worthless babble, this would be no thicker than a brochure and they couldn't get away with charging the insane list price it currently retails for.In addition to poor stylistic taste, this book often fails to instruct the student on fundamentals of database principles by skipping vital steps in closure algorithms or normalization rules. If this is a ""first book,"" then the authors should assume nothing about their reader's knowledge of database principles and not skip steps when explaining an algorithm for the first time."
3,"Bland, but O.K.","While this book is nothing special, it certainly isn't poor either. A First Course in Database Systems is highly lacking in colour, which would have greatly improved the readability. Nevertheless, the text itself is written such that it is easy-to-understand and the concepts are described neatly and concisely.Due to the lack of colour in this book, I recommend that you use post-it notes in conjunction with this text."
2,Too complex...,"I had to use this book for an upper level course and found that everything was explained harder than it actually needed to be. As with the first reviewer, I found that the later chapters that involved SQL were the only chapters that I got anything out of."
1,could have been better,"my class is using this book as the primary book. I have found that the explainations are often very wordy when they can be put very simply. So far the book has been using essentially one running example, i think this is one of the weaknesses in the book. also i have found that the excercises do not necessarily reflect the examples in the text. could be better."
1,A student who had to suffer while reading,For anybody who does not have to read this book - don't waste your time and money to read it. Simple things are explained in a far too complex way. The only good part about the book are the later chapters where SQL is introduced.
4,"Easy to understand, relevant - but so boring to read",This book is ok in many ways. The topics seems relevant for a deeper understanding of relational database design (academic). It's easy to understand. On the downside: The book doesn't use UML but E/R (which is a downside in my opinion). And finally - the book is quite boring to read.
3,It is what it says it is,"Due to cost considerations, I purchased an older edition. The book is, for the most part, clearly written. Occasionally, the writing is somewhat stiff and academic, but not unusually so. The book may be overkill for someone who needs only a surface treatment of the subject matter, but if you truly intend to work in this area, you are likely to find this text valuable."
3,Could be a little bit better....,I read the whole entire book and found it to be helpful in understanding the subject of Databases. It uses running examples to explain different concepts. However I did find many grammatical errors and I think some subjects could have been explained better like Weak entities and Normal forms.
4,"Dry, but Informative","I have read several database textbooks and have yet to find one that breaks from the ""dry but informative"" mold. This book was no exception. However, there are plenty of diagrams to help hammer in the abstract concepts of database design."
4,A worthwhile purchase,"I have really enjoyed studying with this book! Unlike most others, with techniques for logic games that are easier to understand, and this is very well written! I would recommend it to anyone struggling with logic games, especially if they are struggling through other books without much luck."
5,Best Book Out There,"I was absolutely ""stuck"" on the logic games section -- it was what handicapped me the first time I took the LSAT, when I missed roughly half the logic games questions. I got every prepbook out there, and they only made my problem worse -- infinite game types and setups to memorize, etc. By a few weeks before my second LSAT, I was at a point of extreme desperate. This book was akin to define revelation -- it's concise and conversational, and the answer to all logic games hang-ups: Brian Talbot tells you that all logic games are basically THE SAME, and that they can all be solved using one straightforward method. I went from missing half the questions on logic games to missing only three -- I improved my LSAT score by five percentage points to a 166, and I honestly owe almost all of that improvement to this book. If you can only buy one, get this one -- no BS, it's the best book out there."
2,Not my first choice for LSAT prep,"I purchased this book in preparation for the October 2005 LSAT. I had about 3 weeks to prepare (not the smartest idea), and purchased this book along with Powerscore's Logic Games book. I used the BFGG for about 1.5 weeks and worked through more than 1/2 of the book and had no improvement at all. While the author's technique is logical and straightforward, I feel it is not fast enough to finish all the games. I'm one of those people who thinks deductions are the way to go (which is explained perfectly in Powerscore's book). If you have a ridiculous amount of time to prepare for the LSAT (6 months or more) and find that Powerscore doesn't have you feeling confident, then go ahead and pick this one up, but I don't think that will be a case. Unlike me, you might be fortunate enough to learn something of value."
1,Only for Morons,"This book discourages thinking and teaches a robotic approach to logic games that takes substantially longer than finding simple deductions that lead to quick points. In the end the book suggests it's okay to make deductions, but it gives few, if any, recommendations on how to do so. Moreover, the method propose by this book, suggest writing out every possible solution to a game until you find what could be true. If it is the case that choice E could be true, you may have had to just write out 5 full solutions. This is clearly a waste of time when a simple deduction could have answered the question in a matter of seconds. If you have tried other methods, but still can't seem to be able to form inferences, then use this book and you will be able to correctly answer questions on 2 or a max 3 games out of 4."
2,Not Good... at all...,"We rented this one from the library awhile ago and turned it off after about 20 minutes. The production value is bad and the ""acting"" is worse. It was painful for my husband and I to watch and just confusing for our 2.5 year old daughter and did not hold her attention (or even interest her slightly)."
4,"Good, basic information","Karen Bawoll's book is a great guide for new guinea pig owners, but lacks the detail of other books. It's a great place to start to learn about cavies. Note that a guinea pig's cage should be at least 7.5 square feet, however. Visit www.guineapigcages.com for more info. Good luck!"
5,Nurture you own beauty,"Creativity is the wellspring of our own innate beauty and connection to Creator. Williams gives us simple but powerful tools to nurture, support, and express the Creative Force within each one of us. The nondominant hand work draws out amazing insights into how we can birth our own most powerful Self. Most of all, she gently guides us to create lovely expressions of our Spirit which can utterly transform self-image. Simply the best guide for spiritual self expression available today!"
5,Inspiring and important work,"I absolutely recommend this book for anyone interested in self awareness and the visual language. It really was a breakthrough for me in recapturing the joy and satisfaction I experienced as a child who loved to draw, a major step in recovery from art education."
4,It cannot hurt to try this,"It certainly cannot hurt to try this book. I find that if actually gave me peace of mine doing exercises,I managed to put a curb on my worries and look at things differently."
3,Good book but,The book is really good but the first one I ordered was missing section 3 so I got a replacement and it was missing the same pages. I might order the kindle version but am wondering if it has all it's pages.
5,Fan-stinking-tastic!!!,"Is it the comprehensive information on running day camps? Is it the great way the book is laid out for day camp administrators of all skill levels? Or is it the CD Rom of documents to help you through the paperwork process of day camps? Answer: YES TO ALL!I have been a day camp program manager for 11 years and learned through school, job training and mostly experience. This book is not only a great ""how to"" for beginners; it acts an amazing refresher course.The content in Day Camp from Day One can ""plug-and-play"" into any day camp vehicle, be it a YMCA (where I started), or a civic day camping structure for cities (where I am currently).I recommend this book to any camp director, program director, exec, board member or church parishioner starting a day camp or starting over.Connie Coutellier is my new hero!"
2,very basic Day Camp information,This is real basic information on how to run a Day Camp. You should be able to get this book directly from American Camping Association on-line for cheap.
2,Poor text for HR,"This was the text for my HR class in 2003. I am pursing my Masters. I found the text to have good examples of HR practices however, to be unorganized in fashion. It was not an easy text to follow as it jumps around a lot. It also introduces many ideas and then tells the reader that it will address the idea in a later chapter. This was very distracting. The practice test from the website are very helpful."
3,Not for beginners,"While this book has some very beautiful gliders, rockers, and chairs, it was not designed for a beginner in woodworking. I had trouble with the terminology used and wouldn't even attempt these projects. In addition the book has an over abundance of bird houses and feeders (9 patterns). So if you are looking to build easy, strait forward lawn furniture this is not the book for you."
2,Bird Houses or ?,"Yes, this book is definitely about bird houses. It does have a few other plans. It is your classic low quality plan book. It may give you an idea, but I would not be inclined to build anything out of it."
2,Aftermath,This remastered album has lost much of the edge of the original. A classic that has been rendered ordinary
3,A tad overrated...,"This album runs quite long for it's time (approx. 53 minutes), and that's part of the problem. ""Going Home"" clocks in at a very indulgent 11 minutes. I don't even think it's a good enough track to merit 3 or 4 minutes, honestly. Yet it rambles on and on.But there are several classics on this album, the best known being ""Mother's Little Helper"" and ""Under My Thumb"". ""Stupid Girl"", ""Lady Jane"", ""Out of Time"", and ""I am Waiting"" are also great tracks.A number of the tracks sound fairly undistiguished to me (Flight 505, What to Do, the above-mentioned Going Home). This album is still a way's away from the peak Stones of '68-72.""I am Waiting"" was used effectively in the motion picture ""Rushmore""."
4,This album is a true gem!!!!!,"AFTERMATH is one of the best albums the ROLLING STONES have ever made. I am reviewing here the UK version, which has alot of great songs. This album starts off with 4 classic songs that have ever been made: MOTHER'S LITTLE HELPER, STUPID GIRL, LADY JANE, UNDER MY THUMB. These 4 songs alone are worth the price of buying this album. After these songs, there are still some good songs, DONCHA BOTHER ME, GOING HOME, FLIGHT 505, are songs that deserve a listen to. HIGH AND DRY, TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT are songs that also get a good rating by me. The sound on this remastered disc is awesome, I think you can really hear the difference over previous releases. So I think that you will appreciate this album and not be disappointed in adding it to your collection."
2,Perfect record but wrong cd,"The quality of Aftermath is out of the question, after all those lame cd versions of the 80's and 90's these gems finally got remastered properly. Amazon sent me the wrong cd though. I had ordered for the late 00's remaster that came in a nice digipak and a certificate but got a much earlier yankee version in jewel case with poor artwork, very disappointing. And you cannot return the cd once you opened it, so be advised on this. My first disappointing purchase over Amazon."
3,No Paint It Black? Forget it.,"Paint It Black is the song which started me as a life-long Stones fan. And I still consider it as one of their top 5. I bought Aftermath as my first album. Without this song, the album is just not the same."
5,"Buy this one, not the US one!","This is the best Stones album from the early days, and my favorite along with Sticky Fingers. Get this one, not the US release since the US release is like possum urine compared to this, which is like caviar!! Mother's Little Helper was the best song from the early years, and the idiots left it off of the US release. I really like Brian Jones, and I feel like you can really get a sense of his genius here, the best from this era. I burned this to CD immediately, and it is in my car player and staying for awhile!! So fun!!"
5,Stones at their best,"I think Aftermath was one of the under-rated Stones albums in the 60's.The UK version is clean, clear, and a bit more bluesy than the US release.Highly recommend it."
5,great case; greatly facilitates taking the camera everywhere,"I once heard it said that no matter how great a camera you have, if you don't have it with you, you don't get the picture. the beauty of this case is that it makes carrying the camera (I used it with the Pentax Optio S-the 3 meg pixel camera) and a spare memory card and spare battery (highly recommended) soooooooooooooo easy/natural. get this and you may find yourself using the camera much more.only wish is that there was a mini-tripod that fit in."
3,Functional....but ugly,"I just purchased this case for my new S5z. As a previous review said, it does indeed fit very well, which is important. But I am surprised that Pentax, which puts so much emphasis on style with their Optio line of cameras, would sell such an ugly accessory to go with them. If I had to do it over (and I might since these little cases sell for $9-15) I would have gone with a LowePro."
2,Not that great,"I like the idea, but the slippers just aren't comfortable to stand on. It's great while you are sitting, though."
1,Poor Quality,"If you are looking for this movie, buy the VHS release from VCI Entertainment. It has better picture and sound quality."
3,Not too much underneath,"Indie electro-pop walks between original and derivative but ultimately, despite a general consistency, remains disposable. Despite some labored production and experimental proddings, there just isn't much to hang yourself around in these tracks, indicating a band more inclined towards intricately arranged bells and whistles over substantive arranging."
4,Very happy with this card reader,"I bought this reader to download pics from the SD card in my Nikon D80, and save camera battery power. It's small, light, and does the job great. It also reads the microSD card from my cellphone. Just what I wanted!"
4,"Does Everything It's Supposed to do, but a little clumsy","Let me start by saying if you get this, you won't be dissapointed. The quality of the reader is pretty good, the only real problem I've had is getting confused on how to put the cards in, since it was possible to cram my SD card in there the wrong way and even putting it in the right way doesn't seem natural.Another problem I've had is that the reader is kind of clumsy to use. Since your card will be sticking out of the side of the thing, it's impossible to use any USB or Firewire slots next to it while reading cards which can be a problem if your choices are limited."
5,Compact and Convenient,"This thing is awesome.. I bought this with a Micro SD 1Gb card and this thing works like a charm... It's easy to cary around in my pocket or backpack while walking around campus... I would DEFINATELY recommend this to anyone who has a cellphone with an SD card, or someone who enjoys taking pictures and making videos on the go!"
4,Very functional,This device has two slots that support many kinds of cards. It even comes with a little USB cable so that the device doesn't have to go directly into your USB port. The shipping was a bit expensive considering the product's size and weight; I paid 8 dollars for shipping on a 4 dollar device.
1,Do Not Buy!!,"This product broke within hours of me recieving it. It worked fine the first couple of trys, but then the computer stopped recongnizing the reader. Since then I have read up on this product and found that this is a common problem."
3,"It is not mobile, but it is a card reader","it is a good card reader, it was very fast and very compatible with all my operating systemsit seems to be pretty cheaply constructed, first of all it has light plastic that cracked, also the keychain lid is pretty much wortheless, DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO PUT IT ON A KEYCHAIN, and also the little rubber door that protects the card slots got ripped to shreds by my keys when i put it on my keychain"
1,"Unreliable, doesn't work at all now","I bought this device about two or three weeks ago and have used it maybe 10 times. Now it hardly works if at all anymore. I've erased the registry entry like the support site suggests although it worked briefly after, now it's gone back to not working at all.Took it to a friend's PC and it didn't work on his either, although his Windows 2000 seemed to fix it after messing around with it.I'm going to return this as soon as possible. Very disappointed as I use a lot of other Sandisk products and have had no problems with them."
1,Take your chances - very unreliable for me,"I was hoping to do away with my USB drive and have a single media for my camera, PDA, and laptops. I have tried several laptops and none recognized the adapter (actually they do, they just don't see the media). I even tried it on my Linux laptop and no luck either.I have read other reviewers praising this product. Believe me, I was rooting for it. However, this was a terrible dissapointment."
4,it works,"it does its function, everything in order and without problems, the only thing i didn't like was that it doesn't read SDHC but it's my fault 'cause maybe i didn't read the descrptionCumple con su función, todo en orden y sin problemas, no necesita drivers.Lo único que no me gusto es que no lee SDHC pero es mi culpa por no haber leído bien"
1,SanDisk SDDR-103 MobileMate SD+ 5-in-1 Mobile Reader (SD/ MiniSD/ MMC...,"It's Does not work with 4GB Micro SD, It's working with maximum 2GB Micro SD....that's Bullshitt....!If you are looking for Micro SD card reader then please don't buy this one."
1,Did not work!,"It did not read any of my SD cards. As other reviewer pointed out, this will not read you larger-than-4GB card. I could not test if it works for smaller cards simply because I don't own one. You will be better off with a cheapo card reader (less than $2, search amazon for""SD SDHC MMC Memory Card Reader USB 2.0 for 256MB, 512MB, 1GB, 2GB, 4GB, 8GB, 16GB Memory Cards!"") than with this ""good quality"" sandisk product. Returned it will be."
4,good item,i love the mobilemate sd. I haven't had any problems yet. It's small compact and gets the job done.
2,About This Thing,"This product is not for the heavy handedafter 2 weeks of use one of the slots was non functional because spring leaf to hold the card against the contacts some how managed to get bent into the path of the card, and seeing that the slot is for a flash card it is almost impossible to get any tool to fit to do any 'repairs'.on the bright side it did work with the stated flash types."
1,wtf - doesnt support sdhc - please down review,I got lazy and bought the device based on the overall good ratings without digging in. I see everyone who bought this device recently trying to use an sdhc card got screwed. It does NOT work with my macbook pro/lion sdhc card. Light comes on but nothing happens...
3,Does NOT work with SDHC,I bought this SDDR-103 without carefully reading the product description and did not notice that though this reader reads SD cards it DOES NOT read SDHC! Very disappointing. Now I know why it was so cheap. SDHC format is the more common/newer memory card format used in high megapixel cameras.The SDDR-104 does read SDHC as does the Sandisk Micromate
4,Good product,"This chip reader works well. It even comes with a usb extender so don't have to fit the reader into a tight place. I wish the cap was a little sturdier, but that is my only complaint. This item got to me quickly."
2,Far too bulky,THis item does what it says but when you put the SD/micro SD card into it's slots it takes on a strange shape and difficult to manouver to those hard to reach spots on the back of a desktop.Much better SD to USB converters out there
5,The Best..,"It's really handy and usefull..i used to have one reader but it was too big now i have all in one, i was waiting for this...."
4,Almost perfict,"I ordered this one with a micro SD. The combo works perfectly, however I already owned one I bought a long time ago and my SD card does not work in it for some reason. Perhaps they work perfectly for a year or two, but age... I dunno."
1,SanDisk SDDR-103 MobileMate - good luck,The reader didn't read my 2G MiniSD. I have another reader that does so I dumped the MobileMate and took the lost.
5,A very handy adapter,"I must say, I can't live without this adapter. Since both of my phones take MicroSD/Transflash cards now, I am constantly needing to transfer files between my laptop, my phones, and my PC. This does the trick with flying colors. It is about 5 times faster than transferring the files from my phone using a USB data cable. It doesn't need any drivers installed and is plug and play on both my Windows XP and Windows 2000 computers with absolutely no problems. This is a must have accessory!"
1,BEWARE: The Product Description is Misleading,"The Product Description for the SanDisk SDDR-103 MobileMate SD+ 5-in-1 Reader is misleading! It implies that this reader can use SD, miniSD, MultiMediaCard, RS-MMC, TransFlash, Memory Stick, Memory Stick Duo, Memory Stick PRO, and Memory Stick PRO Duo cards. This is incorrect.The MobileMate SD+ SDDR-103 can read SD, SDHC, miniSD, miniSDHC, microSD, microSDHC/TransFlash, MultiMediaCard, MMCplus, MMCmobile, RS-MMC, and RS-MMC Dual Voltage. However it does NOT read Memory Stick.The MobileMate MS+ SDDR-107 can read Memory Stick, Memory Stick PRO, Memory Stick Duo, and Memory Stick PRO Duo.I need to read a Memory Stick PRO Duo card and mistakenly bought the SDDR-103 based on this product description. I don't know how the SDDR-103 performs because I can't use it. But I gave it one star to get your attention. If you are reading this review then maybe you won't make the same mistake that I did."
1,misleading,"This is an old product that does not support SDHC (any >=4GB SD cards). It should not be sold in the first place (who are using <4GB card these days?). I am sure I am not the first one who are trapped in its high ranking and misleading statement...The cheapest card reader that support SDHC is only ten cents (the most common medium sized transparent one with two caps on both ends or the smallest transparent one, they both come into various colors). I know those flimsy things hardly survives more than half a month. But hey, at least we can buy sixty seven of them for the same price of this much more sturdy but not useful card reader."
3,"Does the job, but very awkard design","It definitely gets the job done, and SanDisk has been a good company in my experience.The way you insert cards is irritating--the SD slot is a *tight* squeeze and even if you put it in right-side-up it feels wrong; for a moment I was confused and almost took the card out and put it in the wrong way. In addition, the microSD slot faces OPPOSITE of the SD card slot*, which is a great way to add more confusion for the user.I guess I don't have any REAL complaints. I've bought/used more elegant card adapters before, and I'll forever worry that one day I'll be careless and insert the SD card backwards.* Don't put two cards in at the same time (as per the directions)"
4,"Works as promised, very compact.","I find the SanDisk SDDR-103 cad reader to work well with my SD cards, I have not tried any other media. The fact that the card sticks out of the side of the reader allows it to be very compact, but this could concern some people who have multiple USB ports side by side that all need to be in use while downloading files off the card reader. I have not found this to be an issue in my normal use. Great product for the price."
4,Good product,"I haven't had even the hint of a problem with this product. Insert your SD card, plug it into your computer, and instant access to your picture.Only problem I had was that it is a little larger than I had hoped."
2,Tight SD Slot and Shaky USB Connection,"I bought the SanDisk MobileMate SD+ to use with a MicroSD card I purchased at the same time. I chose the MobileMate SD+ because it had a lot of comments (100+)... most of which were positive. I haven't used it to read the MicroSD card yet. However, I did try it with some SD cards. I found two issues with the MobileMate SD+. (1) The SD slot is very tight. The contacts on the SD cards were scratched after being inserted and removed from the reader. I am concerned that frequent use will ruin the SD contacts. (2) The USB connection (I'm not sure if it is the reader's socket or the short USB cable it came with) seemms flaky. I have to wiggle it a bit to get it to work (have the second light come on indicating card detection)."
2,Limited compatibility,I purchased this disk reader so that I could transfer images from my LG cell phone. Didn't realize until I investigated why the MicroSD disk couldn't be read that the reader is only compatible with a handful of devices. Cards used by my phone cannot be read by this reader. I'd purchased two readers... one for myself and one for my sister. Waste of money and time. Recommendation: Research SanDisk's website to find out if your device is compatible with the reader before you buy it.
4,"Awkward, but works.","The SanDisk MobileMate SD+ 5-in-1 Mobile Reader is perfect for what I needed it for - reading the Micro SD card in my LG VX8300 phone. It also comes in handy for reading the SD cards my Nikon digital camera uses.As pointed out in other reviews, the rubber slot protector is useless and will probably tear off in no time. It's also kind of awkward to plug into the USB port on the computer with the cards sticking out of the bottom of the MobileMate Reader, but at this price, who cares."
4,good card reader,"It does what it says, and it's small. It's worth noting that this is a READER, it's not some sort of enclosure to make a keychain drive out of a flash card. When in use, the inserted card sticks out of the side of the reader. This helps keep the reader's size down, but it does mean that you can't keep a card in the reader and throw it into a laptop bag because the card could get damaged. If you keep that in mind, it works great!"
5,Perfectly compact tool,This is our second one (because we needed two between us) and I am still impressed. Why buy the bulky built in stuff when all you really need is this? Its easy and simple. Totally worth the purchase. I have had one for 6 years now and still have had no issues with it
1,"Doesn't read anything, wast time","I just go mine from Amazon. But it doesn't read anything, SD, MicroSD... Have to return. Not happy!It looks like a low quality product but that's not a big deal for such a price. It suppose to work."
1,Does not work properly with 4G SDHC,"After receiving this sd card reader, I was able to use it once with my 4GB SDHC card. After that first time, it stopped working... and now it is too late to order another/return it because I am leaving for my trip abroad."
2,Cheep Price- EXPENSIVE SHIPPING,"The item I bought cost $2.15, but my shipping cost over $9.00. When the package arrived, the postage was less than a dollar. I am disappointed with the excessive shipping costs, I felt like it was a bait and switch."
1,does not work for mmc cards,"i bought this item hoping to transfer the pictures off on my nokia 3650, but alas the thing does not work. do not buy this reader if you have mmc it soes not resd it. windows kept saying that i did not have a 2.0 usb port for it to run off of, which is crap i have four."
5,works well,"this is a great little tool for use of downloading info into your cell phone if you have a micro SD, received in a timely manner :) thanks !!"
4,Great buy,"Definitely a good buy if you are a laptop user. I chose this reader in particular because I was looking for something I could slip into my pocket or laptop case that didn't require any kind of cable. It's not the easiest thing in the world to insert or remove a card while the device is plugged directly into the back or even the side of a laptop, but the 2"" USB cable helps. The protective rubber flap is a little pathetic, but sort-of does its job."
3,Only for 2GB or less.,"Unless I missed it on the page, I didn't see any information about what size of SD card this reader supports. I just purchased an 8GB card, and this reader doesn't support it. The largest amount of memory it can read is 2GB. When I asked the seller about this, I was referred to this reader: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0024CP5I4"
1,Does not work on Snow Leopard,"I purchased this card reader because of the micro SD reader and the portability factor. The unit has both of those capabilities, it just does not work on my mac. I went to the Sandisk website and followed the troubleshooting instructions and it said it was a software issue. So I selected my operating system (Snow Leopard) and it had me down load a driver. The drive was an exe format (windows). So no support apparently from Sandisk for mac. Sad day."
4,"Does the job, most of the time","I got this reader solely to read SD cards, and it does that without any problems. My Macbook recognized it right away and file transfers were fast and easy. I also tried to use my MiniSD card and that's where this reader failed. It could not recognize the MiniSD from my LG8100. I never needed that in the first place but keep that in mind if you are planning on reading MiniSD. Had no problems with the regular SD cards though, it read 1GB card, I havent' tried anything bigger."
3,"Mediocre product, but gets the job done.","I bought this a few weeks ago to transfer things between my SD cards, Treo 650, and MacBook Pro. I found out recently that it also fits in the front USB ports on my Xbox 360, so that's kind of cool too.It works pretty well, though the rubber slot protector is pretty worthless. I'm sure it will fall off in the near future, from keeping this reader in my pocket.Sure, it has some design flaws (as others have already pointed out), but it does what it's supposed to do. For what it costs, though, it isn't any better or worse than other items in the same price range."
2,Falls short,"Elegant design, poor execution. I like the form factor of this multi-flash reader, and the fact that they included two caps, one with a connection for a strap. However, it falls short because of trouble writing to SD cards. Since day 1, it has intermittently given me some trouble. It normally refuses to write to a non-write-protected SD card if the card is seated all the way in. I have to wiggle it out a half millimeter or so to make it work. Have had no problem with my 16MB and 32MB MMC cards, but I only use them when I need to transfer data and this reader is refusing to work properly. Have had no problems with a new Mini-SD card. I have not tried it with RS-MMC or TransFlash."
4,RE: Good little card reader,"My friend and I have camera phones that came with a really small micro SD card (64MB :-( This little card reader is a quick way to transfer pictures and video off the phone and upload to e-mail. We tried using the internet connection on the phone and using the phone as a USB modem - if you're used to cable ot T1 speeds, its not appealing at all to use the phone connection. The SanDisk Mobilemate offers an affordable and compact solution to the file transfer problem."
4,Strips are handy for posting flyers/posters,I work in a university setting in a music dept. We were trying to minimize the amount of concert posters taped to the walls so we ordered about 35 of these aluminum framed cork strips put them throughout the halls and stairwells. Each one comes with 3 double sided sticky packages and 3 one side sticky/one side magnet strips. I used the double sticky patches and put a bead of clear silicone on the rest of the back of the strip. I then attached them to concrete block walls. Seems to be holding well and they are already full of concert posters and announcements. ...saves tape on the walls. The only thing that may be an issue for some of you (hence 4 stars) is that push pins do not embed all the way up to the plastic (cork is not really that deep) but we have no issues with the push pins staying in so far.
5,Heater hose,"This heater hose connects at the water pump on one end and the quick connector by the fire wall. The hose was pushed onto the quick connector and held with a clamp from the factory. Removing this clamp, I was able to pull and slide the hose off without removing the quick connector and install this new hose easily."
1,Don't buy this book!!,"Aside from being poorly written, this book had very little information that really would be helpful. The authors seemed to think by stating the obvious, they were somehow instructing the reader in the art of writing love letters. Most people already know what they want to say; the problem lies in how to form their thoughts and ideas into a coherent and romantic letter. This book is offers no real help in this area.Aside from the above problems, the final reason which made me return this book, is that the authors tried to instruct the reader on how to write a letter to someone you'd like to have an affair with. I found this not only evidence of poor judgement on their part, but quite repugnant."
4,Family Matters...,"Amanda (Antoinette Bower) is a depressed, suicidal woman. Who could blame her? After all, her father hated her, loving her self-worshipping sister, Nell, instead. He dropped dead one day, leaving Amanda at the mercy of her greedy, sociopathic brother, Edward (Jack Ging). Nell seems to have vanished on the same day old daddy died. Now, Edward has hired a ""nurse"" (Rita Conde) to make sure Amanda winds up dead, so he can inherit his father's entire estate. DIE SISTER, DIE! is a good, solid thriller with no need of gore or cheap effects. It looks into the minds of twisted people who will do just about anything for money. The terror lies in knowing that creeps like these actually exist! DSD has some cool characters and a nice little ending (though not too unexpected). Enjoy..."
3,Back in the day movie,"It had the mystery suspense like the hitchcock and other movies of its time had. I did watch it all the way through. When movies are boring I cut them off. This I did like watching, it will be only be one time but it was what it was worth."
1,Does not work with Canon Digital Rebel,"It is NOT as claimed Compatible Battery Charger Set for EOS Digital Rebel.They even contacted me that will refund me, but I never received refund!I'm really disappointing, that now I have useless charger."
5,Perfect!!!,"My crabs love this, especially because i mixed it with some FMR hermit crab food!! They are both Happy & Healthy- thnx HBH for making such a great mixture of a variety of foods."
5,Great little manual!,"Great book on these mechanics! I've learned similar mechanics in Wing Chun, similar but not the same. To a martial artist, the mind and breath exercises described herein are things that could be taken into other areas of training, rather than just this technique.If such a technique can be learned from a book, it can be learned from this book, but one must build the skill patiently and a step at a time, as it is explained.I don't know if this is a good buy for a regular person, but it's a treasure to an impassioned martial artist."
3,Just Ok,"The one inch punch (or floating punch) is technique that is used in many different styles of Kung-Fu and this is an OK book to explain the punch, but you really need to learn this from an instructor, there are just too many aspects to this to learn from the book."
2,Nice but dispensable!,"This book gives some good exercises on how to improve your external strength. But actually some of the body mechanics described are unnecessary and may even be impedimental in an actual martial encounter. A pracitioner of one of the internal martial arts (tai chi, bagua, hsing i) should not need this book. But then it's always nice to keep a Bruce-Lee-Brochure in your bookshelf ;-)"
1,"Not a good book, but a decent pamphlet.","It is 40 (small) pages long, and half of the space is taken up by photographs. The information is OK, but you could probably find all this and more online and for free."
2,not the real thing,"the type of punch that bruce lee used in his demonstrations was more of a push than a punch.the type of power generated in the internal arts is different from the type shown in this book.this power is lethal and stays in the attackers body causing internal injury.often called by the name fa jing or fali{in yiquan}it is developed by hours of standing meditation and mental projection exersises that turn the tendons to elastic.only then is it possible to get the right interplay between relaxation and tension that will unleash the explosive power.this power is in everbody,it just needs the right training to bring it out.this book has some basic training techniques that are of some use to a beginner.if you want the real thing try studying the works of wang xiangzhai.yiquan really does work but it does require dedicated training of 2-3 hours per day.nothing in this life comes easy.there is plenty of free info on yiquan on the net ."
1,"Nothing special, didn't work","I originally bought this book a couple years ago hoping I could learn this parlor trick of a technique to show off to people at parties. I read the book several times, but couldn't figure it out. Later I took up Wing Tsun (which contains the punch) and realized after being taught the punch, it is nothing like described in the book. .... Nothing great in my opinion."
1,Gals love this song...Guys hate it... go figure!,"The only reason I listen to this song is because my girlfriend likes it! I'm a romatic, but I prefer Shania Twain's songs...""You're still the one"" and ""from this moment on"".. I hope she feels the same...""from this moment on"" should be our wedding music, but its up to her."
1,tHIS SONG TRULY REEKS,"I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT THIS SONG IS REALLY THE WORST. WORSE THAN BSB (I HATE THEM TOO) ALL THEY DO IS HIT THEMSELVES IN THE NUTS REALLY HARD AND SCREAM AND THEY CALL THAT MUSIC! ! :("
4,made me feel alive,"i love this song so much, what a fantastic song ever i found. It reveal my impression and life. l really love it."
5,"I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT!",I heard this on the radion a few weeks ago and I fell in love with it. It took me a week to figure out the artist and I was astonished because I never really liked Savage Garden before! It's totally awesome!
1,Alas.,"Author's anonymous friends aside, this is not a five-star book, not by a long shot. I've rarely read a book where I couldn't get through more than a paragraph without howling -- and I've read a LOT of unpublished work.For commentary on chapter first sentences: http://deirdre.org/blog/index.php?p=49"
5,Nice Surprise,"This is a nice gem from the Moody Blues. They play every song with feeling and emotion, you don't get a lot of that from today's artists. This cd should be in everyone's Christmas CD collection!"
5,Absolutely Lovely tunes,"This is a very beautiful album. It is hard for me to understand any negative reviews.I can only guess that those reviewers have a particularly odd ""taste"" in whatever drivel they call music.Muse is the key root-word here.The Moodies are splendid MUSicians...crafting beautiful sound melody and lyric...and adapting other's lyric (poems) or conversly their melodies is so well done on this album.They are true to themselves, and the Muses. Not something commonly found these days.This music can be enjoyed through the Christmas season and beyond.It makes a great gift too!"
4,Roland's review,This is a very good cd and that is quite a recomendation from someone who hates Christmas music in general. You find yourself playing this before and after Christmas. The Moody Blues keep on making exceptional music. Enjoy
3,Not So Much,"Um... I have every Moody Blues album. I bought DAYS OF FUTURE PAST on vinyl the first week it came out back in the sixties and played it to death. I love the Moodies. But much to my surprise, I don't love their long-awaited Christmas album that much. Go figure. Nothing wrong with it... Justin Hayward is in good voice... but.. it just does not sound very 'Christmas-y' to me. I expected something else, I guess."
5,Best Christmas music ever,"It is truly great to hear some new Christmas seasonal music, and some of the songs are really amazing. We first heard the song ""December"" in concert this March 2008, and I like the live version more, but it is a beautiful song nonetheless. I would love to hear more of these songs during the holiday season, instead of the same old stuff we are bombarded with for the 2 months before Christmas everywhere we go, now atleast I can at home."
1,Dreck Boring Bland Dissapointing,"Save your money! Worst Moody Blues ever. Even worse than ""Keys to the Kingdom"". I almost threw it out! Definitely bottom of the stack material. Even my listen to anything (but rap or country) wife though it was crap."
3,Blue Jays lite?,"Without the retired Ray Thomas (and Mike Pinder) and various sidekicks, drummers and keyboard men, this is merely a 2003 version of 1975's 'Blue Jays'. Moodies would never have had more than one of these sentimental songs on an album. Great sound, catchy lyrics ,calm (with minimal pretense) and very soothing..hopefully it will sound better as the snow really falls in December.... but how long can these 2 guys (ok., three, .but did Graeme participate?) legally be called the Moody Blues? Pales when compared to Justin's View From the Hill."
1,quite possibly the worst holiday CD ever recorded,"I've got well over 100 Christmas CDs. The first things that came to mind when I heard this disc were... Awful. Terrible. Boring. Abysmal. Dreadful. Appalling. Sleep and/or vomit inducing. I think you get the idea.Unfortunately, I couldn't save the review without giving it at least one star. The bad thing is that it doesn't even deserve that. Shame on what's left of this band for subjecting listeners to this dreck. Be afraid. Be very afraid."
2,Dreary,"Being a Moody Blues fan most of my life, I immediately bought this cd when it hit the shelves. I try to give this one a chance every Christmas season to get my money's worth but I'm giving up on that this year. The music is uninspired and boring. The lyrics are downright depressing; which spoil a few songs that would be good, otherwise. This is the band's most negative and cynical work and it's supposed to be a ""Christmas"" album. Thanks, but I'll keep things on the cheery side this year..."
3,very subdued,"While this is not a bad album it didn't live up to my expectations of the Moody Blues. Very disappointing was their inclusion of John & Yoko's Happy xmas (war is over) in which they left out the main message of the song...""war is over if you want it"" (=peace). They printed the lyrics correctly but chose not to sing them which I feel, especially at this time in history, is the whole point John & yoko were putting forth.... war is over if we want it."
2,Big Moodies fan feels disappointed,"I've been a Moodies fan for many years now, and I've experienced their many high points. I don't believe this is one of them. Unlike other fans of The Moody Blues, I don't dislike their new stuff. As a matter of fact, I really liked ""Strange Times"". But, on this CD, only the 3 Justin Hayward originals are worthy. I don't mind the boys covering a few tunes now and then, but it seems like they knocked these off in an afternoon. As for the John Lodge tunes, his songwriting was what originally lured me to this band many moons ago. What happened? His songs now don't have that same, uh, what do you call it? As for Justin Hayward, what can I say? Great songwriter, great singer, great musician. Keep up the great work."
4,Missing selection.,"Fine collection of new and standard Christmas tunes.You can expect anything the Moodies do to be finely crafted.However, why wasn't the previously recorded and hard to find ""What Child is This"" also included? I thought it would be, and it would have made December even more satisfying."
4,A Very True Blue Moody Christmas,"Good quality Christmas music...some standards and a little extra from soft-spoken Justin Hayward and John Lodge. To a Moodies fan, these are nice tunes that satify. To others it may seem to slow, and a bit melancholy, but the tracks will surely hit home for most listeners. This is not a typical re-hash cd of everyday Christmas Classics...there is no attempt by the artists to be anything more than what they are....it's without question, unique, original, and very distinctly Moody Blues !"
5,Worth it all!,"This album is the best to come in years. Such great harmonics and vocals, Justin Hayward really gives you a ""Winter"" feeling. One disappointment that some may have is that it is strictly seasonal. However, I absolutely LOVE this album. I must admit I'm not too much of a fan of John Lodge, but Hayward does an awesome job, and for the price, this album is great. ""December Snow"" is the best song, in my opinion, and is so well-played that you can listen to it year-round. ""Don't Need A Reindeer"" is a catchy tune with a great melody. ""Yes I Believe"" is also a great song because it captures the great range of Hayward's voice, as well as his great guitar playing. All in all, this is a great buy, and I encourage everyone to sample it."
4,"December by the Moody Blues, CD","Not a ""new"" unopened items as expected but it was in excellent condition and arrived quickly. No problem but was expecting it to be an unopened CD."
4,Nice to find some beauty for this season....,"With all the news around the world being so gloomy andthe threats of so much violence just a click on your localTV its nice to hear this collection of holiday/christmas/winterharmonies to lighten things up. I must admit I hadn't boughtanything from these guys in years but I listened to severalof these tracks and ordered this and I'm glad I did! I can'trecall such beautiful songs and harmonies, I don't care whattheir former reputations are/were, this is an excellent collectionof songs especially right for this time of the year. Mostpeople don't stop long enough to listen to music during theholidays but give this one a listen, its quiet and mellow with a message, yet has a traditional homage to what made classic Christmas musicso special and so rare these days. A nicemix of what I love about the Moody Blues. Nice piece of workfrom a Band that just keeps going."
3,Not one of their best efforts,"I have been a rabid Moody fan since 1970. I love the vocals by Justin Hayward, the lyrics, the cool instrumentals and the messages.This was a bit of a let down. Not up to their usual excellent work! The songs were OK, not great, even the 2 classic carols at the end. One bright spot, ""Happy Christmas"" was done better by Hayward that it was done by John and Yoko. I just don't happen to like that song."
5,Excellent album,J'écoute December depuis quelques jours et j'adore.La magie des Moody Blues est d'avoir fait un album de Nol qu'on aura le got d'écouter à tous les jours de l'année.Bravo.
1,Disappointed,I was quite disappointed in this knife. The edge was not as sharp as another knife I have been using for over a year without sharpening. The blade is quite thick which I don't like and it rusts in the dishwasher. I would not buy again and am sorry I bought the a matching paring knife as well.
3,"Spongebob Scooter a joy for kids, but hard to assemble","We gave this scooter to our 4-1/2 year old son this Christmas who has never been on a scooter. He really enjoys it. Unfortunetly, it was difficult to put together with poor directions from the manufacturer. We called them and they emailed us some updated instructions from a Dora scooter that allowed us to ""barely"" assemble. Once, when the scooter fell over a small part cracked but it is still safe to ride. With better assembly instructions, I would rate this product higher."
2,Did not like it at all,I bought this for my 3 year old and he had a hard time scooting on it. He kept hitting the wheel in the back with his foot. After only about 2 months the Spongebob thing on the front had broken off and the metal parts were rusty.I ended up buying a 2 wheel Razor scooter to replace this piece of crap and my son has been riding that one for over a year and a half now.
2,Sponge Bob disappointment,"I bought this scooter for my son, who is five. He's on the short side. However, this scooter is too short. There should have been a more detailed item description which indicates how tall the scooter actually is, or a ""recommended age"", which would have told a buyer whether it was actually appropriate in height. Also, the instructions were completely useless and my husband had to wing it when putting it together. The Fuzion scooter I bought for my older boy is so much cooler!"
1,very bad purchase,this was the worst purchase i have ever had in my 5 years of purchasing anything from amazon . The frame was all twister and my son was very upset with it .i will never buy anything again from here again.
3,"works well, but won't last a lifetime","I bought this to replace a Photoflex litedisc that I hadn't used for three or four years. When I popped open the old disc, the room was filled with a shower of tiny paint flakes. I guess that means these things have a limited lifetime..."
5,Best book ever written on numbers,"This may be the best book ever written on numbers (covering whatever ""numbers"" recall to you). An alternative, cross-cultural study that easly substitudes for any book on number theory and history of mathematics. Full of descriptive examples from up to thousands of centuries past and any place you can imagine on earth. The publication company I work for prepared a Turkish edition of this book which is already one of the bestsellers in Turkey only a few weeks after its publication date.Ozgur Kurtulus (ozgur@tubitak.gov.tr)"
5,Tender Michael Burkard,"What? No one has yet reviewed this tender and beautiful book? Burkard is open and egoless as water, and his sensitivity is luminous. Read ""Hat Angel"" and cry, cry, cry."
5,Jumpstart the Mystery,"When I fall into the drone of monotony, I turn to Michael Burkard's poetry again and again to jumpstart the mystery of living. Be inspired."
4,Smoke Alarm,I installed the smoke alarm with minimal problems. They seem to work - but I haven't had a recent fire to really check it out!
1,"Hard to open, hard to separate from mounting ring",The engineers who designed this should be forced to do nothing but separate the detector from the mounting ring over and over and over for 30 days. Then they should be fired.
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If I could give this product negative stars, I would. I cannot begin to explain my anger and frustration with these products and this company. The issue is false alarms - consistent false alarms. Usually in the middle of the night, waking up my entire family - including my one year old daughter. I have called the company, had them send replacements - which do the same thing, taken all of them down and cleaned thoroughly, replaced all batteries etc. I have even opened up my window and thrown one out like a frisbee in the middle of the night.... stay away from anything made by this company, THEY ARE PURE JUNK !!!!!"
1,Does not last as long as it says,Bought these because of the new laws but they didn't last more than 1 year not a good purchase for us
3,smoke alarm,I like that this is a small unit so I can mount it almost anywhere It has a good loud alarm
1,JUNK,"LET THE PRICE TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY. I BOUGHT TWO, ONE WORKS THE OTHER ONE WONT STOP GOING OFF.COMPLETE CRAP"
1,Stupid Listing,"This is a completely stupid listing on Amazon. I could not find in the title, the product description, or the specifications whether this is an ionization or photoelectric detector. No wonder people are complaining. Maybe its the wrong type for the location. Kitchens should not have ionization detectors.Do not use in a Kitchen or humid area."
3,Uneventful,"It's very difficult to review this item since I have't had a fire in my home since purchasing them. So they just sit there like a lump ofcoal and blink every so often. Very uneventful.It's about as exciting as watching grass grow. For the first few days it was fun to watch for the LED to blink, but that grew tiresome quickly. I will let you know if anything exciting happens, like an alarm."
2,Occasional false alarms,Purchased four of these. Two occasionally go off for a few seconds for no reason.
1,Poor quality... poor choice,"I purchased 4 of these at Walmart as replacements for the older style for difficult placement areas like my garage and barn rafters and basement ceiling. The first one came with an ""ultra-life"" dead battery, thanks very much. The second one for the barn starting chirping after 5 months and despite repeated battery replacement never stopped until it was permanently removed. The one in the garage and in the basement never make a sound, so I don't know if they work... and after my experience with the other 2 I'd better test them again.... which means I might as well not have bothered with ""long life."""
1,10yr = pure bull - only lasted about 1 year,"I bought about 6 of these - within a year they all started chirping from a low battery. Replaced with normal Duracell and now they work, but that defeats the purpose. It's not what is advertised"
4,Good choice for a smoke detector,"This is an easy to install, compact smoke detector with a battery that should last (they claim) 10 years. The price on Amazon was very good."
4,Arrived as described,"How can I rate this product immediately after receiving it? I bought it for the battery long-life, so I won't be able to complain about it unless the batteries wear out within the next 12-18 months. Other than that, it looks just fine, delivery was fine, product was intact. [I only buy things that qualify for Amazon Free Super saver shipping - maybe that's why the products always arrive perfectly packed]"
5,Excellent Buy,"Thrilled with thispurchase of a smake alarm that has a lithium battery that will last a year. Placed one in each bedroom, in kitchen,and in main living room. Very satisfied and would rcommend product to everyone."
5,So far fine,"I bought these for my daughter, two to them, they came with everything needed and were easy to install. Ask me in a year or two and I'll tell you how they are doing."
1,Bad Deal,"I ordered six of these based on generally positive reviews and First Alert's reputation. Perhaps I just got a bad lot, but the first one failed the test phase after several minutes of squeezing the provided battery and then an alternate into the battery compartment. When I tried to activate and test a second detector, the battery would not fit, period. So I am returning these in favor of a Kidde model with lithium battery that is sealed and activated when attached to the mounting bracket."
4,Great stuff,"I heard ""Reverse"" on an Internet radio station and went out and bought the album. With all the crap on regular radio, you forget that good music is actually still being made! This has some really strong songs (although a couple of more ""ordinary"" efforts keep my rating from being 5 star) and there is a sensibility here that is totally fresh."
4,Great WWI read,"This was the second book I have read by Ernest Gann and while I don't think any book could be better than Fate is the Hunter, this had to come in as a close second. The book tells the story of two fighter pilots in World War I and while fictional work, Gann uses factual evidence of the aviation battles in the Great War to back up his story. The author can make even those who have never flown feel the power of being in the cockpit and makes the skies sound as majestic and dangerous as they can be in real life. Gann's ability to draw the reader in makes for another great book that is hard to put down and is a thoroughly enjoyable read."
4,a superb read for new and experienced traders,"successful trading system development requires a firm grasp of financial markets, statistics, and clever computer programming and Mr. Kaufman offers a little taste of each to his readers. The chapters on ""market reality"", ""risk and return"", ""trend following"" and ""robustness testing"" are well written and very helpful, while sections on ""neural networks"", ""fuzzy logic"", and ""expert systems"" are basically filler material and of not much practical use. All said, it is one of the better books on the subject."
4,Computerized System Development,"This was a good read on trading methodology and system development. The best concept is that of the ""unable"" trade, which is where your system gives a buy signal but you can not get your order filled. This is a double edged sword in that you would get filled on trades where a buy was signaled, but the trade results in a loss and not on trades that would have been highly profitable. The end result is hypothetical returns that are higher than they should be. Probably why so many successful paper systems fail when applied.Now, aside from the trading methodology which is well written, there is a lot and I mean a lot of Programming Language in the text. I don't want to take away from the concepts which were great, but if you are not planning on writing a computerized trading program you may want to search elsewhere. On the other hand, if you are working on a ""Black Box"" trading system, I would highly recommend this text."
4,SUNPAK MAGMOUNT,"THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT WITH MY KODAK DIGITAL CAMERA, IT ATTACHES AND DETACHES INSTANTLY AND HAS ADDITIONAL SAFETY CLIP THAT LOCKS CAMERA IN PLACE. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT IT SEEMS TO BE DESIGNED FOR SMALL TRIPODS WHERE THE TRIPOD MOUNT IS THE SAME SIZE AS THE MOUNT BASE. I HAD FOUND THAT THE WINGS OF THE THUMB SCREW WOULD STOP AT TURNING OF THE SCREW WHEN TURNED, BECAUSE THEY WOULD COME IN CONTACT WITH TRIPOD BASE WHEN TURNED,WHICH PREVENTS ADJUSTMENT OF BALL HEAD."
2,Not that great for gorilla pod and SLR,"I do a lot of outdoor nature photography (ForestWander Nature Photography) and I really needed something that is light small and strong.I though I had found it with this ball mount. It was purchased with an SLR gorilla pod (because Amazon had the widget that said people who bought the gorilla pod also bought this) right before I went on a week long nature expedition.Unfortunately, when I connected this to the gorilla pod the tightening screw hits the mounting platform of the gorilla pod. Glad that I tried this at home before going into the field.It really is not meant for an SLR (I use a canon 5d mark ii) but it may work ok with a point and shoot.If you are planning to use this with the gorilla pod, I would think again, it really does not work with that. I ended up just screwing the gorilla pod to the base of my camera when I needed to, which work just fine. But it would have been nice to use this with my main tripod and with the gorilla pod interchangeably."
2,Good Idea Bad Design,"Getting right to the point I think this head is more of a novelty than a tool. Though the magnet mount is a clever idea the ballhead FAILS miserably. First, as others have mentioned, the tension or ball release lever is too close to the base and hits the tripod plate thus making it impossible to turn more than 1/4 of a rotation before it hits the tripod base. Second the ball is simply too small, even with a Canon G11 the camera can slip with just a little effort. This is not bad if I need to simply get it on the tripod to do a self portrait or group shot but anything that requires panning or tilting is extremely frustrating.I think product is a great idea that was never field tested because if it were 1/4 inch taller and the ball 3mm wider both problems would be eliminated for most travel tripods and 99% of P&S; cameras."
1,Slow Release,"It seems wise to introduce magnetic quick release, promoting as instant mount. But the reality is that it is much slower then a conventional quick release, not to mention the potential danger it has.I now understand why this is the only magnetic one in the market."
3,Too small,"I was suprised to see how small this mount was when I received it, I am using it on a Canon SX1 IS, and am not real happy with its iability to keep my camera sagging some times on the tripod."
2,not the same as description,the description said air but is a co2 tank. I didn't have the chance to test it because i don't use co2...
4,Great first album,"The album is great considering it's their first big realease. The music is emo, but not the normal depressing emo - it definitely has pep. The only thing I didn't like was how over produced some of their songs sounded on the cd as opposed to when they had independently released them. Check out mp3.com to hear more."
5,i heart jamisonparker,"this ep is amazing. their lyrics are so well written, and both jamison and parker are very talented along with ted and jarrod. Their ep is definitly worth the 6 dollars it costs, as i already have 2 of the tour special edition, and plan on buying the real ep. Jamison and Parker are also extremely nice and jamisonparker is also a very good band live."
1,Terrible edition of an important work.,"This is the 1895 edition by Charles Whibley of Underdowne's 1587 translation of the Aethiopica. Whibley is a smug editor and you probably ought to skip his introduction. However, you should not buy this book--not only is this exact edition available for free via Google Books, this copy is virtually unreadable, as the pages are dark and slightly blurry. The free PDF is infinitely more readable and won't set you back twenty bucks."
3,Not an academic review,Corporate Warriors was in general a very boring book. Yes it was acurate and informative but was very dry. Singer seemed too biased against PMCs. I was also dissapointed to find out Singer has never been to Iraq himself to see PMCs at work there. When one writes a book with bias and with such depth I would like for them to have immersed themselves in the topic rather than write an academic report on PMCs. Sorry for the negative attitude but was dissapointed by the book.
4,Contractors and war,This Book puts together how the contractor works in war and for other government purposes. This will help you understand who is doing a lot of the dirty work in the world today. Well written and quick paced so you don't fall asleep reading endless stats that some books present.
1,Terrible..... seriously,"What the author does is unfairly malign and impugn the defense industry. His analysis is banal and trite. His writing style is pathetic, and his use of anecdotal evidence misconstrues and conflates irrelevant data points and begs of ignorance."
5,the final box set is a little different,"Join in on more highway-hijinx as the Traffic Department of Bokuto station takes on everything from perverts to crooked cops to even ghosts! And a new cop is jumping in to help, although - his personality seems like a perfect match for Natsumi....I wonder how well they'll get along."
4,Old Canned Heat,"I have about 20 Canned Heat cd's all before the Bear and Larry the Mole passed away, it's really good Blues Grunge Rock.If you're a Canned Heat fan this cd is one that you may need in your collection, I have 4 double cd's one triple and the rest are single(album) cd's. Two of the double cd's was produced in Belgium....hard to get"
4,"Good content, bad binding.",I bought this book as a keeper and it is a very good anatomical reference. There is a problem with the binding of my copy which I purchased new. The pages are beginning to drop out. It's a handsome book but quality is measured behond the point of purchase. External appearances can be deceiving. What I thought were stitched signatures turn out to be perfect binding (pages glued in). I love this book but I'm very disappointed in this failure of craftsmanship.
3,Animals good! People???,"I was dissapointed again as far as finding a good book for human anatomy. The drawings of people are out of proportion, shortened as if drawing on a flat table surface will give you. They are also very limited. It was nice however to see female anatomy illustrated. The book however is a great reference for the artist interested in anatomical information for various animals especiallly the horse. It is a keeper for that reason and the great price."
2,Dry,"Yet another dry, pedantic anatomy book that the artist will find confusing and uninspiring. For the artist, few books can compare with Peck's Anatomy For The Artist."
2,Sinks like a stone..,"Marvin Albert's ""Gargoyle Conspiracy"" was written a few years after the Munich Olympics where Arab terrorists murdered 12 Israelis. Now, a State Department investigator must find a Moroccian exile named Ahmed Ben Jahra, and stop him before he can execute his brutal and cold-hearted plan. Albert obviously knew a lot about the climate of Europe then, and we are told that Ben Jahra would probably only face about a year in jail if caught. Anyway, ben Jahra works with the Libyans, and after botching an airline bombing, he is determined not to fail again. Both men are headed for a collison where only one will survive. I found the ending rather anticlimatic, and that's the main reason why this gets only 2 stars."
3,More fun stuff.,"John Stark Bellamy II, Death Ride at Euclid Beach and More True Tales of Cleveland Woe (Gray and Company, 2004)Bellamy puts forth his fifth (and, if his preface is to be believed, final) book of the darker side of Cleveland history, Death Ride at Euclid Beach. If you've read any of the others, you know how this works-- stories ranging from two to roughly twenty pages about some sort of nasty, mysterious, sordid, or otherwise interesting bit of Northeast Ohio's past.While I'm pretty much the target audience for this sort of thing, I have to say I'm glad Bellamy's hanging it up; I'm not sure whether it's his writing style or the innately boring nature of North Coast life, but Bellamy's reflections in the preface ring quite true; any more and he'd simply be treading water. Face it, Clevelanders; we're just not all that interesting. But what Bellamy's managed to dredge up over the years has been illuminating. ***"
4,"Concerning Melia's ""Black Hole..""","The best thing about this book is the series of photos at the beginning which focus in on Sagittarius A*. It is a little thin on theory (purposely); and at the end, he is a little too gung-ho about the ability of science to answer all questions. But in general it is an exciting subject and the author presents it very well."
5,Fascinating indeed,"The subject of this book has been one of my abiding interests since high school. My daughter strongly recommended it to me, with the assurance that it contained one of the best descriptions of general relativity for the layman, woven into the captivating story of the black hole at the center of our galaxy. Finally, someone who is directly involved with frontline research on this topic has taken the time to write about it in language that nonexperts can understand. Why is it that others don't do the same?"
5,Science Writing At its Best,"Take an exciting and exotic topic like ""black holes""and a gifted writer like Fulvio Melia, and what doyou get? A surprisingly and satisfyingly accessiblebook like ""The Black Hole at the Center of Our Galaxy.""At times it reads like a science fiction novel, untilyou realize that all of the contents are factual. It'samazing how far astronomers have come in unravellingthe mystery behind arguably the most bizarre objectsin the universe, and especially the supermassive blackhole at the center of our own Galaxy. And Melia doesa great job setting the stage and then explaining wherethings stand. I particularly liked chapter 3, in whichhe sets out in everyday terms what mass is, and how itis related to gravity. I read it twice before goingon to the next. Several questions that have botheredme for years were finally answered. Read this andcatch up on where science has gone in the past decade!"
2,Not a winner,"I'm now trying this toy in my budgie's cage for the 3rd time over a year and a half, and he has yet to play with it (that I can tell). He doesn't even go near it, really. Not a winner for us."
4,A word about...,"I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was insightful, well written, entertaining and satisfying. I'll have to buy more of the Rachel Alexander & Dash books. I'd never heard of them before I picked up this book, but I'll look for more in the future. The mystery was just right and Rachel's handling of the suspect, Madison, felt very realistic."
5,This is a fabulous workout.....,"If you love advanced workouts, this one is for you. This is a fabulous workout and well worth the money. It is a hard workout, there is a killer jump rope section, but your body will love you for it! If you like to sweat, try it!"
4,Old school but good!!!,"This workout might be old school but it is def. a great workout, that will get you sweating.I am not currently able to workout to this DVD anymore but used to workout 5-7 times a week and this one was still one of the harder workouts I did!!!"
5,Awesome workout,"I like that you can pick the workouts to fit your time schedule. The warm ups and stretches are very effective. Ive gotten alot of compliments how toned, healthy and in shape i am."
5,Excellent Kickbox DVD!,"This is one of my favorite workout DVDs. It gives a good all-round cardio workout, along with good kickboxing instruction with emphasis on using proper form. I especially like the punch/kick sequences, and the cooldown with the practice stretches/kicks."
2,Can't recommend this DVD,First let me say I gave this 2 stars because it did offer some cardio. Was I sweating after running through this DVD? Yes. Was I irritated while doing so? Yes. Do I regret spending money on it? Yes.My main issues would be that: this DVD is insanely slow in some parts; it can get so ridiculously repetative that even making it through one workout is a task; the shots of the hosts go inexplicably in and out of black and white or sepia; Kathy Smith herself can hardly keep up in a fluid motion and flops around so much like a spastic ragdoll that even if the picture stayed on in color you would be hard-pressed to follow her lead; and finally all of the above really combine to one irritating waste of money.
2,A bit disappointed,"I was not happy with this DVD. I purchased this DVD because on the back it said the 2nd kickboxing workout was approximatly 120 minutes..in reality, it is only 40 minutes. I was looking for a longer workout and was not happy spending my money...felt a bit cheated."
1,Terrible..don't waste your $$,This shouldn't be called a Kathy Smith Dvd because she just does the workout while other trainers do the training. It's not fun at all and is actually quite boring.
2,Flashy but disappointing,"I didn't like the jazzy camera angles or color changes at the beginning of each section. Too much time is spent putting flashy images on the screen and you have to wait around for the workouts to start. I expected more from the Tai Chi workout, like actually feeling ""focused, energized and refreshed!"" as claimed on the cover. This workout was WAY too minimal. Not being familiar with aeroboxing or kickboxing, I'm not surprised that I couldn't keep up at first, but, I think Kathy's pace makes adjusting for your fitness level difficult. You really need to already be familiar with these moves, or at least really coordinated.Basically, this purchase was a disappointment. I don't recommend it."
1,CD player doesn't work along with other problems.,"The first unit I got wouldn't charge the ipod nor would the cd player read any cd's. Called iLuv tech support on the weekend and got a message that mailbox was full try again later. I returned it and got a second unit. Once again, the cd player wouldn't read any cd's. Tech support did answer this time when I called during office hours 8-5pm EST. But could offer no solution. Return it a second time and I won't purchase it again."
3,Not enough power!,This unit works fine. I have had it about a month and have had no problems. All the controls work well. The only major problem is the sound. It doesn't have a lot of volume and the sound is a little tinny!
1,amazon BAD Expeience,"I perchased used iLuc I7500 Mini MP3 Stereo two weeks ago. It was shocking to see boroken box poorly boxed.Missing remote, scrach and dings everywhere and MP3 not working.I tryed to contact this seller, off couse no responce at all. I wasn't too much expected to this happen to me but, I will never buy any thing from amazon."
5,Is a great sound system,"I am very happy with the sound system.It is not the very best sound, but is very good and easy to use.My husband helped me to installed and it was very easy.You can really enjoy the music.Is cool that you can play CDs and Ipods, Mp3 and more.I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use,and this is it. This is an excellent product."
1,Stains!,Well ths wld have been great if the actual scrapbook wasnt covered in stains! Even though the scrapbook was wrappd the stains looked like they had been there befote wrapping

5,LOVE IT!!!!,"I can't stop listening to it! Such a thoughtful mix of music. Great for yoga practice as well as just listening to at home, in the car, wherever. I absolutely love it.Emily (Venice, CA)"
5,My Yoga Students' and My Fav Yoga CD,"Bought this CD on Amazon (hello, can't beat the price! - well, when I bought it a couple of years ago anyway) and from day one and still today, this is my very favorite CD. Every time I play this CD in my class, my students always ask about it. Listen to the sample snippets and you'll get a good grasp of this CD's flow. I've taught, using this CD, a vigorous class to a gentle class and it just always seems to fit the mood."
4,great for yoga class,This cd has good flowing sounds with varying music from all over the world. Well worth the investment.
5,Cheap little stone,"Bought these to try and use in a red sea berlin airlift skimmer, while the designs are very similar the inside tube on the red sea is smaller and these do not fit. Cant fault Lee's for that as they designed it for their skimmer not the red sea one."
3,Decent but not perfect,"These boots are pretty decent for the price. I can't complain too much, I only got them for a Halloween costume so I wasn't looking to spend too much. For the price I'll say they're actually pretty good and actually really comfortable (I haven't worn them for any extended amount of time though.) All in all worth it, but I only gave it three because the tops of the boots fit really loosely and seem huge. I don't know if this is me (do I have an abnormally small calf compared to my feet?) or the boots."
1,Pooped out less than 1 year,"Bought this system less than 1year ago and the only maintenance needed was to add distilled water to the battery. Went away for a weekend and my 8 year old sump pump quit while I was gone. Arrived home to find the sump pit full and the battery alarm on. Talked to basement watchdog and they advised taking it to an auto supply shop for an overnight charge. The store tried to get it to take a charge for 24 hours without success. Agree with other reviewer, go to the auto store and you get a less expensive battery that will last longer than this piece of crap."
1,Missing a sensor knob,The product comes without the knob through which the low battery sensor inserts. This has to ordered from the vendor too.
1,MADE IN KOREA JUNK.,"Do not buy this battery. The made in USA is now made in Korea. Plus- they did not drop the price.You need to add the acid before using it. Make sure you are wearing work pants/shirt/shoes and have plenty of rags. You will spill the acid.Also- they do not supply the yellow cap that you insert the water sensor. I will need to call them and have them mail it.Lastly- the first battery only lasted 4 years. I will not buy this battery again or any of Watchdog products. They made the unit so you need to buy their junk battery. A good AC Delco marine deep cell battery will not work with their unit and the AC Delco battery should last over 7 years without adding water every two months!!!!However, you could have them upgrade the unit so it can use a marine deep cell bettery."
1,Junk,"Two and a half year old battery was supposed to last 5-7 years. Not enough juice to pump water. Recharged over night. Now it pumps if tested but I can't trust it. Basement watchdog should recall this junk and give people their money back. If the warranty is one year then it's a one year battery, not 5-7."
1,Watchdog Back Up Battery is disapointing,They don't include a yellow cap for the fluid sensor so you have to remember to re-use this 25 cent cap from the old battery! Really? You can't just include it with your replacement batteries? Now I must call the 800 number and wait 5 days to get a stupid 25 cent cap. Way to go Glentronics.
1,pice of crap,"I only have this battery for 16 months , I only used ones an is broke all ready.!!I'll not recommend to en one to buy this."
4,Very good..,This was x-tra special. The organization could have been a little better. All in all this is GREAT! I'll read it again soon.
2,Has some good points but overall don't agree with his tactics,"I read this book because a friend recommended I read it. While I found the author made some good points (like we need to be sharing the Truth and we need to be focusing on being obedient not actually making a convert), I found that many of his tactics and his overall system of witnessing seemed to be like a sales pitch. Some of his ideas seemed to be ways of trapping people into listening to you witness. As with all books, read with discernment and always let the Bible be your authority. He also seems to not be a Calvinist (doesn't seem to believe in God's sovereignty in election or irresistable grace)."
3,"Helpful, But Deficient","I own a copy of this book and have listened to brother Bill Fay speak. I admire his boldness and courage to share the Gospel. But I am not inclined to use cookie cutter approaches anymore, with a little salvation prayer formula at the end to close the deal. Evangelism involves discipleship. Getting involved in peoples messy lives. This type of evangelism that Fay is promoting I call hit'n'run evangelism. It's a good book to get some pointers and tips and maybe a dose of courage, but be with people. Call them and lead them into the Kingdom. That would be a better way.Here's a better resource for evangelism;One Thing You Can't Do in Heaven"
4,Nona Delichas,Nona Delichas es un excelente grupo Bajacaliforniano radicado en Tijuana el cual tiene un estilo muy peculiar que lo hace facilmente identificable de otras bandas.Recomiendo a toda la gente que este en busca de buena musica escuchar ND ya que es una agrupacion de primera con musicos de primera.Lo unico lamentable aparte de su desintegracion es la dificultad para conseguir sus albunes.
4,"Stylish, cute and easy to maneuver","When I received my Quinny, I was a bit surprised by how large and heavy it is. I though most expensive strollers were light. But once I assembled it and took it out for a ride, I really began to love it. It is easy to maneuver, so I can walk my 100 lb lab with 1 had and use the other to steer the stroller. It's great for running so I can shed those pregnancy pounds. I love the color! I got juice and I get so many compliments. It really is rare for me to be out and not get a comment. The only other down side is the storage area is shallow and does not hold much. I love my Quinny but it is not for those looking for a light, compact stroller."
3,"Comfy, easy to stroll... but so heavy!","I love the design of this stroller... but comfortable for the baby, and very easy to stroll. However, it's soooooooooo heavy, and I can't carry it by myself. It doesn't have a cup holder, the canopy is too mall, and the basket is very small. I want to love this stroller, but it's really way too heavy for me. I wish I did more research, and I would buy quinny senzz instead to adopt my maxi cosi car seat when my daughter was under 3 months."
4,I love it so far...,"Very nice stroller. It was shipped to me quickly and it is very modern and well done. The assembly took hardly no time, all pieces are easy to snap together. The unfolding of the stroller is great and allows you to do it while you are carrying your baby on the other hand. I love the color options and I will also buy the Quinny bassinet and the Maxi-Cosi car seat, which adapt to this stroller. My only complaint is that the travel case for this stroller (sold separate) is very expensive. I am not giving a 5 star because I have not used it quite enough yet to fully evaluate it. So far I love it."
1,"overpriced, under-comfortable","I am on amazon shopping for another stroller because my Quinny Buzz stinks.Pros:(1) Pretty color(2) 3-level hand bar for different height caregivers(3) Compatible with maxi-cosi car seat so you can use the base with tiny babies (which the [...] folks tested -- so I got rid of the car seat quickly)Cons:(1) It it HEAVY!(2) Front wheel is made of VERY SOFT material and worn out after only 6 months of light use(3) Basket on the bottom picks up 'junk' that you accidentally step on quite easily(4) Despite the huge back wheels, the design is such that you get very, very stuck on rough terrain very easily(5) The recline doesn't really work(6) It is HUGE! It takes up about 60% of available trunk space in an 'average' sized sedan(7) It is lop-sided. One side of the stroller has always been a bit higher than the otherWhy did I spend so much $$$ on this stinky product?"
1,I rub my roast!,"Seemed to me that this book is another example of a celeb-author needing an editor. It is a pity that such a talented man has not given us the insight on his many achievements that we admire for posterity's sake.Ah well, at least we will always have remixed Vincent Price as the indirect result of this man's (or Joey Bishop's?) actions."
1,An inapropriate book.,"WINCH, by Paul WInchell,is a very inapropriate book filled with fowl launguage and nasty chapters. I was sadened to read about this man's rotton life. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS EXPENSIVE TRASH!!!"
3,Not enough information about his family life,"I've been a fan of Mr. Winchill for many yers [...]. This has caused me to wonder about his famaily life through the many years of turbulance in the business. Sadly, though, this book doesn't tell us much about that. There's obviously a huge amount of creativity in his family and we'll never know much about it. Sad!"
1,Rust Bucket,Internal parts rusted out completely in two years. Can only find replacement burners. Comapny does not sell parts. Stay away from Aussie junk.
2,Missing pages do NOT help,"Key pages in some of the articles were cut out, so there was no point in reading the articles. Very frustrating."
4,They don't write 'em like this any more!,"Today's readers know Dan Simmons as the writer of some of the most exquisitely crafted and chilling horror novels. But this book contains his shorter works, many of which are free from the touch-marks of commercial success. They are fiercely blue-glow in their sheer ability to stun the reader with characterisation, plot, formal and yet utterly brutal prose, and unrelenting narratives. After trying to read the stories at one sitting, I had almost started gasping for breath. Slowly, I managed to spread my reading over a long period, and got to absorb the superlative, and yet haunting stories. If you love stories, then go no further. Recommended."
2,"No quality, just speed","While this scanner is quite fast at running documents through, I found that it could not come close to getting any of them properly aligned. I spent more time de-skewing scans than it would have taken to do it on a flatbed scanner. It is plenty good for having 'good enough' images for record keeping, but useless if you are trying to keep higher quality digital records of paper documents."
1,Double feeds pages - I returned it,"Double feeds documents so there is no point in loading up 50 pages to scan. You have to sit and watch it to see if it makes any errors.Ripped one of the pages it was scanning. The software is slow, it takes forever to open up a page. When it does the page is too small to read. You have to zoom to see the page clearly. This slows down your ability to work with the documents quickly. No software manual. Documents do not scan straight, they need to be deskewed but deskew does not work well.Naming each document is a slow procedure. I returned it after one week."
3,Great for small stacks,Although this scanner is fast you can not always place a stack of paper in the feeder and press scan. It starts pulling through 2-4 of the pages at a time. This makes it very diff with the large stacks I am always scanning. I have to feed them one by one. And forget it if someone or something comes in and distracts me because now I have to start all over. I have also found that with large stacks I have to break them up into two files. If I scan to many pages (one by one) into one PDF file the scanner always jams around the same area of the stack. If you are only scanning a few pages for each file I would fully recommend this scanner it is quick. But if you are scanning large stacks of papers or what a scanner that you can count on to only take one page of a stack at a time and not need to be constantly watched while scanning I suggest you continue shopping
1,LOVES TO EAT PAPER,"I've had this scanner for 6 months now. It worked OK the first month, but since then it loves to ""eat"" paper. It scans multiple pages at once. For example, a 20 page document, becomes 15 pages one scanned. I have to scan the same document multiple times (sometimes up to 12 times) until the scanner finaly scans each page. It gets to be very frustrating, actually, it's the worse piece of office equipment I ever purchased. Otherwise it works fine."
1,Worst Scanner in the World,"I bought this HP Scanjet N6010 Scanner few weeks ago and today returned it. I just ordered an Epson S50 from Amazon.HP Scajet N6010 was my nightmere and wastes my money. It almost never works, bad softwares, slow, jamm almostall the time, fail to scan, not efficient at all, takes several pages instead of one by one.Victim like me should report to appropriate entity about this bad product. I wonder what the HPsenior management are doing?If you would like to purchase this product good luck!"
3,Cute but that's about it,"My daughter got this for her 3rd birthday, she is a big Madeline fan. The doll doesn't even look like Madeline but is cute. The accessories are way too small for a 3 yr old to handle. Other than the elevator going up and down, there isn't much else to do w/ this set. The makers should have included another figure/character. I wouldn't pay for than $15 for this, not worth the money. The box that it came in is gigantic, the actual toy is small. Big plus is that the toy is carryable, everything stores inside. Overall, cute to look at but that's about it."
2,Be careful,"Hamilton spent less than three years researching the 39 lighthouses in this book. If you have ever researched any historical site, you'll know that he could not have been very thorough. His research skills are suspect (as he continues to display in articles for Long Island Boating World), and he does not delineate between fact and folklore at times. He even lists the Latimer Reef Lighthouse as being in Connecticut (it is a New York light). There are plenty more errors, but I won't bore you with them.I wouldn't recommend this book to serious lighthouse fans. It's not up-to-date (1987 publication date - much has changed since then) and the information inside cannot be taken as absolute."
2,A re-tread of an earlier DVD - not fair!,"I had purchased several of Keli Roberts' DVD's and thought they were excellent. When I was notified that a new DVD from Ms. Roberts was about to be released, I was delighted and ordered it. Much to my chagrin, this DVD is simply a re-cut version of ""Keli Roberts Lower Body and Core."" There is nothing new here - except that the editors have put more chapter selections on the menu and created pauses between each exercise set (which is actually rather annoying). Nowhere on the advertising for this DVD, supposedly released in December of 2008, is the buyer notified that this is simply a re-titled version of an earlier DVD. It leaves a very sour taste in my mouth."
4,The quirkiness of his genius,"DeQuincey is a writer who thinks in a somewhat difficult and digressive way, and whom I have I must confess, not entirely enjoyed. The pleasures and torments of his opium- experiences are one important reason for the great interest in his work. But DeQuincey is an original and leads us to new places in his thought.I perhaps underrate his power and insight."
3,Smart,"I've been a big fan of Sam Witt's every since I read his book ""The Quintessential Dwarf."" His sorcery and fantasy writings are the best, but this is also really good. I like the part where the narrator thinks he's talking to the refrigerator. And the one where the hobbits have sex. Rock on, dude!!!!"
3,Is this what we was wishing for...?,"dudes, i love the Blasters and i like X and the original Knitters was 1 of a kind, but what's with all the 5 stars here? If the 1st was 5* this is 2-1/2. sorry. mighta coulda benefited from an outside producer and after 20 years perhaps a little better song selection. Wrecking Ball redux is weak and mixed with the vocals down and nearly undecipherable. Some of the songs are good and i wouldn't want to discourage further efforts by what, in tandem, is a hide-skinning band. Little more soul coal woulda fired my boiler."
1,Tournament of Junk,"The United States Attorney General should use this game to punish Felons.This game is worst than a ""Death Sentence""."
1,Very slow...slooooowww. Choppy graphics.,"I have played this game in the PSP, which in my opinio is great. Its smooth, and the graphics are nice. Now, for the PC version, I don't know how it made it through quality control, if there even was any. The worst part, is that walmart doesn't accept returns for refunds. I was stuck with this useless game. It runs in slow motion, and the graphics are bad and choppy.I recommend the psp version though."
1,Basic Book,"Este libro es muy básico, ademas de antiguo es de 1978 y no vale la pena comprarlo, existen otros mas modernos que presentan metodos en analisis mejorados."
2,Bzzzzzzz,"This is a very attractive bat and unique enough in construction material that I had to pick it up. Like another reviewer, the vibration when hitting a ball is almost too much to handle. I left the cages with my hands, wrists and arms aching. Ultimately I had to switch over to my aluminum bat, which was much better. In the realm of natural bats, bamboo unfortunately is at the bottom my my list. Give me maple or ash any day."
1,Beware not all things are NEW!,I ordered three copies of this book and all were supposed to be new. One of the books that I received had a very faded jacket on it and had inserted part of the way through the book a hand written 3 x 5 card in it. I was needless to say disappointed because they were supposed to be gifts for my adult children for Easter.FaithTraining (Faith and Family Library)
5,"SABOR!! (Spanish for ""FLAVOR"")","Very versatile musician, he successfully combines jazzy-like phrases with a very rich influence of afro Cuban style. It would be like tasting Mexican food for the first time. If you like Latin jazz, you won't be disappointed with this compilation of melodies. Hector certainly knows his way around the ""good old 88's"". This record was in fact considered one of the best JAZZ recordings in Mexico.BRAVO HECTOR!!"
4,Non Colombian cooking Colombian Food,"When I initially purchased this book I was pretty displeased with the instruction and with the lack of photos because I really had no idea what any of it was supposed to look or taste like. My fiance is Colombian and I wanted to learn to cook his food for him and I felt pretty lost. Now 3 years later I can say I have cooked a large number of the recipes in the book and all but one have been exactly what he remembered from home. Like the US, cuisine ranges from state to state and city to city and she breaks down the recipes in this manner. Sometimes offer several versions of each recipe, soncocho is one example. I can say this book is my bible now and I learned so much from it. I would say if you already know Colombian food you will love it. If you are a complete novice I think you will find it a bit overwhelming."
4,Finally,"My best friend is Colombian and turned me on to regional food (a lot like Mexican without all the lard, cheese and hot chilis) To have a tamale that doesn't taste & feel like lead was a pure joy, Colombian tamales are light & fluffy....delicious. His mom (like all Colombian women) kept all the recipes in her head, handed down from generation to generation by ""doing"" never by writing them out so she could only say ""oh a handful of this, a pinch of that"" therefore trying to duplicate her recipes after her visits was impossible. Now we have a cookbook and although I haven't tried the recipes yet, all of my favorites are in there and seem to be very consistent with his mom's, I can't wait to try them, let alone give a copy of this book to my friend."
5,Just what I was looking for,I am Colombian and have several well know Colombian cooking books in Spanish but always had issues with the ingredients and some of the complicated recepies. But this book is incredible as it gives you the ingredients as you find them here in the US and the recepies are explained so clearly. Several of my Colombian friends just order the book once they saw mine.
1,Find the real flavors abroad,"I just couldn't believe I had found those flavors that I missed so much, and I made it myself thanks to this wonderful book. It is perfect if you live abroad and have limited access to some ingredients,she perfectly used those that you find in the market. I have many Colombian cooking books but always ended up being frustrated until I found this book. I just wished it had more pictures."
5,English language home style Colombian recipes,A wonderful book collecting together some Colombian recipes my Colombian wife has made for several years plus many many more. All in good clear style and excellent instructions. Simply a must have book for the person looking recipes from this part of the world. Fantastico!Chris
3,Peel is of a good size But is not flat.,the Pizza Peel and Paddle is of pine wood and curved in the with . It dose not lay flat on the surface.i think the wood could have been sealed with something to control this from warping.
1,Split in two after a few uses,Very flimsy design - I would go for a solid piece of wood rather than this which appears to be compressed balsa wood or something.
1,Dosen't last,"I purchased this peel and had it for only two months before it developed a big crack right down the middle of the peel, rendering it useless. I do not recomend this item."
4,Nopro Pizza Peel,"Large size. I've only used it once, but my homemade dough seemed to stick to the peel more so than my other, older peel, not a nopro, but not sure what brand. I'm not sure if the nopro needs to be used a bit more or what, but will be something i hope doesn't happen again."
2,Pizza Peel Review,This item seems to be made of white porous pine. I have used it a few times but it has already started to crack at the lamination joints. Also it seems to warp unless it is sitting flat with some weight on it while it is drying
5,"Cheap, large surface, good quality","I was concerned about this paddle cracking, but am satisfied that I haven't had that problem after several months of use. The tapered edge of the paddle scoops food right up off a hot, hot stone. I would recommend treating it appropriately with mineral oil or other wood-treatment to ensure the paddle stays nice."
4,A Great Peel For Under $30,"I was a little hesitant to order this Norpro Pizza Peel because I'd recieved a Norpo Bamboo Pizza Peel as a gift and it came badly splintered and bonded. This was not an issue with the Norpro 5681 Pizza Peel And Paddle. The wood was in great shape and it looks like good quality wood. As a previous reviewer mentioned: The wood is unfinished. But I seasoned mine with mineral oil before the first use - it just helps seal the wood and it extends the life of the peel. The beveled edge worked well (so long as you prep it with corn meal/flour).FYI: I chose this 14"" pizza peel out a few options:Sassafras Pizza Peel,Kitchen Supply 14 Inch Basswood Pizza Peel with Curved End, andIronwood Gourmet Acacia Wood Pizza Peel. If you want a basic wooden pizza peel I would buy this one."
4,Pizza Peel,"I like my pizza peel quite a bit. I use it to put pizza into the oven onto a stone and out of the oven from the stone. The long handle keeps me from getting burned. It is really handy to have. I also use the peel when I bake bread on the stone. I would have given this review 5 stars except that after 2 weeks, the end of the peel cracked about 1/6 of an inch. The crack didn't go any further so I didn't bother to return it and the peel still works great."
4,"Works great, but too small",This pizza peel works great for small to medium pizzas but is too small for a large pizza. We tried it on a large pizza and part of it fell off and stuck to the back of our oven. Maybe we just made our pizza too big.
4,Alright,"A little thick to slide under your finished pizza, but great for getting the pizza into the oven and onto the stone.Be careful not to cut your pizza while it is on this peel...the wood marks and scratches *very* easily."
3,Took Forever to arrive,Nice Paddle. Serivce is horrible. I ordered it. Then a week later it didn't come. Then they decide to tell me it's on back order. While it said it was in stock. Then I told them to cancel it and they refused to cancel it. Then it arrives 2 weeks later. This will be the last time i buy from amazon agian. This is the second time in a month i got jerked around.
1,Warped and Cracked After Simple Rinse,"Really annoyed with this product. I hand-washed and wiped dry, but it still retained enough moisture to warp considerably and crack right up the middle. Avoid this cheap product."
1,Cracked after first use.,"As 2 others said before me, I used this once, made 2 pizzas, picked up the peel an hour later and it cracked in half in my hands. Everything seemed fine before it cracked so I can only assume that it is not made to last."
4,Pizza Paddle,This has worked great and is just big enough and just think enough to work for putting the pizza in and taking it out.When putting the pizza in the paddle needs to be heavily floured or use corn meal so the pizza doesnt stick.
1,Warped and cracked on first use,"Although nice-looking upon opening, I thought the wood seemed (1) too thin and (2) not sufficiently cured to have any structural stability. After one use, including quick rise and towel dry by hand, the peel warped and cracked. I immediately returned it for a refund and ordered a different brand of peel. Thank goodness the Amazon return process was painless."
5,AC Delco Ignition Coil D555,"According to amazon this part does not fit my 2007 Buick Lucerne, But it was a perfect fit and works very very well. Can't beat this price. Needed 3 for my car and got a great bargin at $75.00 total."
4,Good for beginner information,"The book was helpful as a starter book because it answered basic questions. It was slightly bias and there were parts where I could tell the auther didn't know much on certain topics and was just repeating hear-say because she wouldn't elaborate on her claims. She would just state information and not say why on some topics and then on others she would ramble on to a point almost unneccesary. Overall, I would 100% recommend this book for the starter bird owner but PLEASE also do more research and do not ONLY read this book."
3,"5 Star Photos, Basic Info","I read this book after having already read ""Guide to a Well-Behaved Parrot"" plus some other parrot books in preparation for bringing home an eclectus. While I found the photos gorgeous, I found the information pretty basic and repetitive of what I'd already read. I think Sally Blanchard's ""Companion Parrot Handbook"" is much more informative about parrot behavior and care in general."
3,Eclectus Parrots,"Nice book. Just not as informative as I would have liked. Beautiful pics. After reading, there still were many questions that I would have liked answered. I but say, the seller Seattle Goodwill was perfect in all ways. Check them out for other items!!!"
2,very basic information,"I hope this would be a good book to get before my female vosmaeri eclectus comes home but it doesn't cover much about potential health issues that you might experience when a female eclectus becomes sexually mature and starts to lay eggs. Egg binding is a major issue that I have heard females go through and I'm worried about that. Also, since this is a species specific book there really isn't enough information about the different sub-species of eclectus. It mostly has information about the most common eclectus (Solomon Island and red-sided) and nothing more. It service more as a picture book since it mostly has picture than information.Is this the only book about eclectus out in the market? because it's really disappointing."
2,Great Pictures ....But off the mark,"I purchased this book, and although I thouroughly enjoyed the pictures and the general overall description of the Ecletus, the book is way off the mark in personality, and habits. Most eclectus LOVE being center of the home. THey love to be cuddled, loved and talked to. They DO NOT like being alone and will let you know it. If I read this book BEFORE i got my ekkied I would not have gotten him. It is very informative to grooming and feeding."
4,Good book for the beginners.,"It is a good book for beginners who want to learn the fundamentals of radar signal processing. Derivations are clear and easy to understand. However, if you need an in-depth analysis o the subject you should try other resources."
2,Decent but not the best,"This book covers some very interesting topics however it is not well written.The book is hard reading, both due to the way chapters are structured and the way in which individual paragraphs are written. I did learn from this book, but it takes a lot of effort, you really need to have some idea of what the author is talking about to understand fully what he is saying."
2,not what i expected,"it is mother of pearl and silver. that much is true. it is smaller and cheaper looking than it appears in the picture. my piece also had a very obvious imperfection in the center of the stone. granted, they won't all have that. they are all unique stones. i just hoped the company would be more choosey about what they are willing to sell to their customers."
1,Stick to the 2004 Version,"I was very disappointed after purchasing Quicken 2005 that it no longer supports qif imports. BIG MISTAKE for Quicken. Although I can get a full rebate on the cost, I'm returning it on principal. My entire money management revolves around my checking account. If I can not download my transactions, then Quicken 2005 is useless to me. I will stick with the 2004 version and look for other financial software that will meet my needs."
1,One big cross-sell for other Inuit products,"I am very disatisifed with Quicken. At every turn, the software attempts to sell me into a different product like Quicken BillPay or an IMG account. Additionally, it really only works with other Quicken products which means if you manage your financial life elsewhere (say at a bank or your investment firm). It is not providing any of the benefits like making budgetiug simple that it promised."
1,More wasted money,"Every year they hit you for upgrades. My last upgrade was 2003 and I eventually uninstalled it and went back to 2002 which I was using until last week. This upgrade is no different than 2003 and the user interface ""Bites"". The only reason I upgraded was because they threatened to stop honoring my electronic transactions unless I upgraded. What kind of BS is that. If MS Money wasn't so difficult to use I switch in a heart beat. This is my last upgrade, after this I'm using my banks web site for all my banking needs. The quicken product has really gone down hill and all they want is to get is many dollars out of you as they can."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"If I am not sure, I play it smart and buy the program used. In short I was not satisfied with what I recieved. If the anecdote, ""You get what you pay for."" was applicable in this case, this program would be worth it's price, but it's worth less than I paid. Amazon low price of 13 some odd dollars."
1,I Found Something MUCH Better,"Quicken is far too advanced and complicated for my needs. a friend told me about moneypants.com, a web-based financial software that tracks money and keeps records of every transaction. It's clever and easy, best of all I can access it from any computer. It's got great features like a ""was it worth it button."" It's fun to use and the software has helped me save money and get out of debt.I do not advice for the advanced investor or business owner rather for the average person who wants to manage their cash."
1,Beware -- Quicken 2005 won't let you import .qif Files,"I just laid out $30 for Quicken 2005, thinking it would be a great replacement for ACE-Money which I was using for my checking account. What a mistake. This year they changed their program so you can no longer import data from your old programs or your banks using .qif (Quicken Interchange Format)This makes the program useless, since you can't bring your old data into it from another program or from banks which permit exports of your bank account data using .qif files.Navigating the Quicken tech support page is worse than navigating a mine field. There are no phone number listings and no real help in how to adapt their new 2005 version to older programs by letting you import .qif files into your checking account.If you are enamoured of Quicken, stick with version 2004 or older. The upgrade to 2005 is a catastrophe.Alan Taplow844 John Fowler RoadPlainfield VT 05667802-454-4675 ataplow@jhu.edu"
1,Quicken Doesn't Consider The Needs Of Their Customers,"I've used Quicken for probably 10 years. When I upgraded to Quicken 2005, I rudely discovered I could not longer import transactions for my 401K plan. I feel betrayed and forgotten, not to mention angry. My 401K plan is with one of the largest providers in the country. I'm switching to MS Money."
1,7 Years of Data...Gone,"Perhaps I'm just naive, but as a Quicken user for many years, I assumed that I'd be able to port my data into a new version, even when changing platforms. Common sense (""Intuit""-ion?) would suggest that this be an easy task, but Quicken's reputation suggested it'd be more complicated -- but I assumed still do-able.Well folks, it ain't. Seven years of diligent tracking on my part is gone, and I'm still trying to reconcile accounts, re-set loans and automatic transactions (all gone), etc. What a catastrophic mess. Quicken/Intuit should be ashamed of themselves.If you're a previous user, beware. If you were a user and you're porting off the Mac platform, forget it. I don't know if Money is any better, but at least it wouldn't come with such an insulting slap in the face."
1,Not Compatible With Major Banks!,"I had a choice between Quicken 2005 and Microsoft Money Standard 2005. I very much regret my decision to try Quicken 2005, due to all the time wasted, uninstalling and sending the software back to the manufacturer (even though I bought it from Best Buy--I opened it and thus cannot return it!). Call your bank and ask specifically about the 2005 version of Quicken before you purchase it. They will tell you that you cannot download any of your bank's information into Quicken 2005. Even though it specifically states on the back of Quicken 2005 that it can. The 2004 and 2003 versions of Quicken are compatible with most banks. Go figure. So try Microsoft Money Standard 2005 instead. It costs the same price (about $30) as Quicken Basic 2005."
1,"I only rate as ""1 star"" because there is no ""0 stars""!!","I have used Quicken for a number of years after finding it on a previous computer that I bought new. After hearing that they would be discontinuing support for my 2001 version I decided to upgrade. WHAT A MISTAKE!!! I use only the basic features of Quicken and enter all my tranactions manually. I couldn't even get the information to save to my CD-RW. Their support site alludes to programs that will make this possible with XP but doesn't give any information on them. The best part is that their error message tells me that my ""writer drive"" is a ""read only"" drive after it has written some information on my CD-RW!!! Past formats of the program were very simple and easy to use---this one is nothing but hassle after hassle. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT EVEN IF THEY ARE GIVING IT AWAY!!!!!"
3,CASIO NP-40,"I LIKE MY PURCHASE;IT WAS PRICED RIGHT.RECEIVED THE ITEM ON TIME.BUT,I AM NOT SURE IF THESE BATTERIES HAVE ANY WARRANTY.IF SO WHAT DOES THE WARRANTY COVER FOR AND VALID TILL WHEN?"
3,Track 1: Remember Me,"I bought this soundtrack for Joey McIntyre's song Remember Me. I haven't heard the remainder of the soundtrack so my rating is just based on the song itself.It was released in 1999 but this track sounds nothing like his Stay The Same album released that same year. It has more Meet Joe Mac sound which I personally favoured out of those two albums.If you are a Joey or even an NKOTB fan, this track is worth getting for your collection."
5,Yoga for movement disorders review,"I really enjoy this DVD. It is calming, informative and helps me stretch my muscles and at same time maintaining balance which is a problem for me with regular yoga. I have Cervical Dystonia and feel this DVD is a great tool for anyone with limited mobility from their disease or those who need a slower paced exercise routine due to fatigue."
5,Thank you to Renee,"Thank you Renee for sending a replacement DVD. I have played the entire DVD and this one is OK, although it also was not secured in the DVD case. Thanks again."
3,Black Cobra / Black Cobra Woman / Eva Nera,"OK - there is serious confusion on Amazon regarding the cover art for certain films regarding the titles Black Cobra / Black Cobra Woman. Let's make this clear:Black Cobra / Black Cobra Woman / Eva Nera (1976) - starring Jack Palance has a sexy female vixen on the poster with a cobra. This is a lesbian erotic thriller directed by Joe D'Amato which dates from 1976.Black Cobra / Cobra Nero (1987) stars Fred Williamson and is the first of a trilogy of Blaxpoitation films from the 1980s that, unfortunately, have often been posted on Amazon using the 1976 Black Cobra D'Amato cover art.For a great article on the distinction of the two films - here's a website that discusses the differences:[...]"
4,Another fine effort by the folks at GW,"I am a longtime gamer and have been involved with Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay since the 1st Edition way back in 1990 and remains one of my favourites.Death on the Reik is one of the older adventures, originally published by Games Workshop before they abandoned the WFRP line to Hogshead. The quality of GW's early work is evident in this product: an inspired storyline, terrific artwork and interesting locales.The book details an epic journey the length of the River Reik challenging the players with a good balance of invetigation and action as they attempt to thwart the forces of Chaos.While many people rate the Enemy Within and Shadows of Bogenhafen higher, this adventure is my personal favourite. Be warned that the ending seems a bit of an anti-climax. A more epic finale would have seen this book get a 5-star rating."
3,A Cthulhu Adventure for Warhammer FRP,"This adventure is the 2nd part of the famed 'Enemy Within' campaign for Warhammer FRP originally published by Games Workshop. The adventure, set in the small town of Bogenhafen has been described by its authors as a 'Call of Cthulhu' scenario. This means investigation, conspiracies, secret cults, and fateful summonings. Above all, it encourages roleplay since there is a bare minumum of violent action.While many Warhammer FRP veterans enjoy this adventure and rate it highly, I prefer a more balanced style of adventure design. As it is written, the game features a lot of investigation and interaction, and almost no action. However if your group is fortunate enough to consist of players who prefer roleplay over combat, add one star - this adventure is made for you. Players with way too many weapon specialization skills would probably be unconscious with boredom before the end."
5,Fantastic material,"Not only will WFRP players and game masters get a great adventure (one of a 5-part series), but great detail has been given to the Empire locations the adventure travels to. This book also contains a supplement dealing with river life and trade in general, the lifeblood of the Empire. All in all, a must have for any WFRP player."
4,Awesome Grill,"I have had this grill for about 5 years now and haven't had any major issues with it. The lantern and side burner are great accessories and looks impressive when all set up. I had to get a replacement igniter but now it works fine.you jut have to leave the lid closed while you light it. The torch is brighter than any gas lantern I have but doesn't supply light to the coking surface due to the lid. After 5 years my lid is finally coming apart but it will only take replacing the bolts on the hinge. Also, the side burner knob has broken off and I'm trying to fine a replacement. The only real con is the shape of the grill. It's very awkward to try to fit it in the car with all of my camping/tailgating gear. All-in-all I would absolutely buy this product again. you can't beat the whole package with all the accessories you get."
3,An Improvement,"Even though this book is quite an improvement from Fist of God, I can't believe I paid $32 for it. The Reflection of Evil is a $15 book.I don't know where to start. Maybe it was my copy,but there are so many typos. I could not believe the amount of typos contained in this novel such as misplaced quotation marks, spelling errors, inappropriate punctuation marks. Not professional what so ever. It actually kind of pissed me off because for $32, I expected more.This is an improvement for Nicholas. However, I hope he pays more attention when approving final drafts. I hope he sharpens character and plot development. I hope he finds the courage to eliminate dialogue and character thoughts which are so unnecessary."
4,Excellent product,It took a while to pair the keyboard with my IPAQ as the on-screen instructions were ambiguous.But keyboard itself is great with many built-in and user-defined functions.Highly recommended.
2,Tried and truly not for 700p,The keyboard worked well for about five minutes. Next thing you know it StartEd typIng likE thIS. SO I sent It Back.
4,"very cool, use with laptop and phone","connects quickly and reliably, but when i use it with my pocket pc it conflicts with my stowaway mouse causing it to intermittently disconnect. Not a problem with a BT computer tho."
5,incredible bit of kit,"I bought the Sierra keyboard years ago, to use with my pda. Technology moved on and it ended up at the back of the cupboard. Now I have an ipad2, I was looking for a compact portable keyboard which was touch-type friendly - the roll-up one I tried was useless, but then I remembered the Sierra and thought it was worth a go. Eureka! No problem with pairing and it was up and running in no time. Haven't tried using anything other than simple typing so far, but then, that's all I need it for. Thank you 'Think Outside' you are brilliant."
3,"Nice device, but questionable tech support?","It looks like ThinkOutside was bought by iGo, and after trying for tech support each day for a week, it looks like their web site is finally back up...but a bit weak in terms of tech support-- can't find drivers for Windows Mobile 5.The keyboard is a rather ingenious folding design and has a OK feel when typing, but it's a bit annoying to have the center section not lock in place so that the keyboard does not sit flat. In fact, the bumps on the back of the device keep the center section raised, so when you type it sort of bangs back up and down a bit. The PDA holder is pretty worthless -- mine slid off repeatedly. That's a HP iPaq 5915 which did find the keyboard pretty easily."
1,Stating the obvious,"I bought this book sight unseen, and ended up very disappointed. The fact I actually agree with Galbraith only makes this more maddening.Most of the points he makes challenge conventional wisdom, but are not particularly original in themselves, and his pompous yet abstruse writing style makes reading a painful slog. I have never seen such abuse of the passive tense and periphrases, Strunk and White must be spinning wildly in their graves.This is a very slender volume, essentially the content of an op-ed column padded to fit an essay. The price the publisher is asking for this slim folio (it hardly qualifies as a book) is perhaps the real fraud here."
2,unsatisfying,"This is supposed to be 62 pages, but 5 of those are blank and several more are partially or almost totally blank. This is essentially a pamphlet, but with a hard cover. I don't think it's worth more than $4.The ideas probably needed expressing, but they are not fleshed out at all, and in at least one case, he wandered away from his point and left me up in the air.I've enjoyed several of his other books, but this was not one of them -- an unsatisfying read in my opinion."
2,"Not too bad, but not great either",Berlin by night sets up a lot of good potential story ideas. The political conflicts and the struggle between the princes is presented in an interesting fashion. The kindred are all fascinating. A few of them are even historical figures. The description of the city could have used more work as well as the general culture. Based on the descriptions it could have been any generic city. It really didn't provide a feel for the area. The sample story was a bit silly but entertaining. It did introduce a fascinating Setite character and her awesome plans. Storytellers should do some research on their own to supplement this book if they plan to use Berlin for their games.
3,Be preparted to wait,"I admit I have not yet had a chance to actually try these pads out. The reason for this is it was delivered to me several days after my cycle had stopped. When I bought them, the site told me it should arrive right on time. It ended up being too late for me to use them by the time they actually arrived. I'm sure this is a great product, but you better make sure that you order more around the time your period stops in order to get them on time for the next one."
3,Get exactly what you want and buy the items separately,"There are two things I don't like about this package. It was mentioned by reviewers that the cups are an ugly color of gray and don't match at all. This is true and I didn't care when I ordered but the cups are really ugly. After getting the items, I see that the bowls are way too small. I like the feel and weight of the Corelle and I wanted to match some dishes that I had already, but I wish that I had bought items separately."
1,Never received,After waiting 3 weeks I called UPS and found that the dishes were damaged in mailing and sent back to Amazon. Why didn't Amazon notify me??Why wasn't I sent a replacement set?
2,Dinnerware,Nice corelle dinnerware but the mugs are not corelle; are some sort of pottery from China. Color and content nothing like the dishes. Do not recommend because of the mugs.
5,AWESOME....,"I just got them ...I love it...The entire set was intact,not broken ...One of my best buys from Amazon."
3,Correlle set,"I had ordered this set with high expectations, so much so, that I ordered one for a friend at the same time. My friend received hers without a problem. I, however, received a broken set. I requested an exchange, which occurred within one week. I excitedly opened the second arrival, only to find yet another broken set. The mugs are NOT of the same Correlle material, and are NOT made in the USA, rather I think they were made in Thailand and it was one of these mugs that were broken. These mugs seem to be made of stoneware, i think. I arranged another exchange, only to be informed that the breakage seems to be a widespread problem, and that they would not be able to replace the set afterall.I suppose, at least, I should be grateful that the set I ordered for my friend arrived unbroken and that she did not have to deal with the hassle of packing it back up and arranging it to be picked up. I thought Correlle boasted its nearly unbreakable quality?"
5,Quality daily dinnerware at a reasonable price,I've used Corelle before and tried several other brands of dinnerware for daily use after passing my sets on to my kids as they moved out. I always come back to Corelle. You can't beat the durability and value.
5,Just as advertised,"The entire set arrived undamaged and pretty quickly so I was impressed with the process. I would confirm what others say here - the set is very lightweight, I can already tell it is very durable and it is bright white with a nice glossy sheen. The mugs are heavier and have a solid, diner feel to them. Are they are pretty as porcelain plates from William Sonoma? No. But I've broken or chipped half of those in the sink already. This a great utilitarian set of plates for everyday. Save the good ones for special occasions and you won't have to deal with expensive replacements."
2,Cheated on Cups,The bundle as a whole had good value. But Amazon shipped cheap porcleain(breakable)cups instead of the original cups that were supposed to come with the set.The porcelain cups are slightly duller than Corelle's white. So they dont match well too.Buyers beware.
3,"Decent, but not great, cleaner","Well, read all the raves about this product and decided to try it. It is a decent cleaner for large screens but not what I would use onsmaller LCD's such as computer screens. The cloth it comes with is OK for non-glossy screens -- but I've used better dish rags.The people that rave about this obviously have either never used a screen cleaner before or have been burned by truly horrible products.It is fit for its intended use on large screen LCD's and plasma sets but nothing special and there are better ones out there in the same price range."
2,NOT MY FIRST CHOICE FOR LCD,I had a projection tv NOT an lcd or plasma it worked well on that every time but for some reason on my lcd it left these ugly white smear marks that I could not get rid of.
2,Horrible sickly-sweet odor,"I tried this for the first time, and was horrified to realize that my TV and laptop computer screens now give off a very unpleasant sickly-sweet odor left by this product, yuck. I'm returning it fast!"
1,this stuff sux,This stuff is not work buying. I got a 43inch samsung tv and now it got a bunch of streaks across the scree. the spay sux ace and the cloth is even worse. DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE
5,Best Cleaner That I have Tried,"Finding a good LCD cleaner is not as easy as it should be. The other products that I have tried have been difficult to use, they generally leave smudges and streak marks. This product is easy to use - No Streaks, No Smudges!"
4,Like the End RESULTS!!,"Ideally this was purchase for using on my flatscreen monitor, though after testing out found it was great on our LCD television's. Using it sparingly is advisable due to a little goes a long way. I'm happy with the purchase"
4,Good deal,You can't find this stuff cheaper at retail stores. It does the job without scratching the screen. It will last you a long time too.
5,What a View!,"I thought that the cleaning solution I had before this was good but the CleanDr is something no person that claims to love their electronics should be without. I used this on my LCD monitor and I could not believe it. The darn thing looked brand new! My family thought I was nuts because I was going around the house cleaning any LCD screen I could find and I even cleaned an old CRT TV with it! I will never use something that isn't a polymer blend cleaner on computer monitors or LCD TV's again. It brings them back to what they should be so that when you see whatever it is your viewing, be it a movie or a document your working on, there is not a single thing getting in your way. No scratches, no smudges, no fingerprints. Nothing but a clear screen!"
3,Still needs work,"We tried this ScreenDr on our computer and television (55"") screens and we found, when examining the surface with a flashlight it was covered in smears. But we managed to get rid of these by wiping over with a plain, water damped screen cloth, (our cloth came from Apple), and wiping over again with a similar Apple dry cloth. After doing this the smears were removed and our TV in particular has never looked so good, it was like stepping up to the next quality of a video recording. So due to these results we would buy this product again but did find it necessary to finish off the process as described above."
4,Absolutely great!,"That base plate adheres strongly to any metal surface. I use it on the side of a tall file cabinet in work. It definitely can take the weight of any winter coat, including my parka.What I didn't like was the hanger itself, which is too light-weight plastic in my opinion. I replaced that with a standard metal-framed wooden hanger. So that's why 4 stars rather than 5 from me."
1,hanger failed the 2nd time I hung a LIGHT coat on it,"I am sure that the manufacturer of this product is a wonderful company, and I do not mean to disparage them. However, my magnetic hanger had to be returned because it is of no use at all. For the almost $30 I spent, I expected a durable product. This was a magnet strip glued to a metal base. I'm sure the manufacturers of the glue are fine folks also, and I do not mean to disparage them, but the particular batch of glue used on this product is not strong enough to keep a postage stamp in place. I said the product is of no use, but I just thought of one: This is a great product if you want to place bets with your coworkers about when your jacket will fall to the floor. I would say seven minutes."
4,Great Promise- that delivers,"Fantastic Musicianship- great vocals. Only downside is that the subject matter becomes a little repetetive... but musically it is fantastic.After listening through this a few more times over the weekend, it is really growing on me. Vocal style harkens to Squeeze, but I definitely here shades of Bono with a softer edge at times... a number of the tracks can definitely get stuck in your head, in a very positive way. Give this a listen!"
1,Faulty Products not worth the price!,I ordered two Q6511A cartridges. Arrived within the allotted timeframe but one was cracked and spilled toner all over the place the other had a broken arm. Neither worked. Poor quality and poor craftsmanship. When I asked to return them they asked me a list of questions about the product that I wanted to return. They already had the item number and order number. Stupid for me to have to do that.
1,Bait and switch,I was shipped a different toner cartridge than I purchased. Although the ad had a picture of the Hewlett Packard box and product I was shipped a refurbished cartridge of a different brand. I have yet to receive a label to ship the products back as I was promised by the vendor. The refurbished cartridge did not function properly and leaked a repeating ink blotch on the pages we did try to print. I havenot received a bill from Amazon on my visa and do not know if my account has ever been credited or not. I will NOT be buying a product of this type on Amazon again.
5,How educational it is,"This book is very educational for those who are majoring or minoring in Criminal Justice. The book itself explains how the Criminal Justice works. In addition to this, the book helps you understand the laws. It also allows you to understand each and every law that the government of the United States has set. The author of this book seems to be very detailed and specific about every law and details of these. Another thing that makes this such a great book to any college student who has great interest in learning Criminal Justice is that it has great illustrations to explain the rights and wrongs of the law."
4,Wonderful,came in quick and was new. Very happy with the product and will order again. The product is going to a lot of use
4,"Thick Book, Easy to Use.","Easy to use, and written without the bull most books have. Good resource, or for using for class. Delivery was quick, and book looked as though it was brand new."
5,A masterpiece!!,"Finally, a film that deals with the sensitive subject of lesbian vampires and the drug dealers who love them."
3,A Basic course in Moroccon arabic,It is really boring but it is the only one I found in the market that has the correct dialect.It needs to improve on helpfull pharases and grammar.It is better than nothing and unfortunately it does not have all you need.
2,Lacking In So Many Ways...,"Moira wasn't the kind of heroine I like...she lied constantly, denied her feelings for Jack - constantly - and resorted to stealing even while claiming to be no thief. Too ridiculous.Jack wasn't bad. I don't think the author did a good job of describing him, though; i.e. his looks, and his personality. He would go from being happy to downright angry and vice versa. There was no in-between with this guy.Spence had a lot of potential, but Jack shut him out too much. Spence was his very good friend, probably his best friend, yet Jack didn't like to confide in him and only did so when he had no other choice. That made no sense. Spence was loyal, Jack wasn't.And lastly, the story dragged and was too repetitious. I will say that the author is good at making bad guys bad."
4,Fascinating pix of the Orcas.,"A must see for whale lovers and students of marine biology or zoology. This is a well organized video of the Orca pods in San Juan Harbor, WA describing their habits and behaviors. It includes interviews with scientists and boat captains narrating fascinating stories about their close encounters with the Orcas. The video footage of the orcas as the breach, spy hop and dive are well done to the level of awesome and must have taken hours of patience. Includes interviews about the challenges to the future of this large population of Orcas. Well done."
2,Not enough descriptive detail,"You don't provide enough descriptive detail for me to order: Is it a magnet or is it a decal for back of car? What are the dimensions of the item? Looking for a holographic decal,not a magnet (that someone else could lift off) of waving flag .for rear of car."
3,Great device if it fits your ears,"Easy to pair, worked from day 1 with ease (Nokia 6085). Price of $4.99 after MIR at OfficeDepot didn't hurt one bit. Battery life seems fine, have yet to replace it after a few weeks. Plenty loud enough, and I have documented hearing loss. One *GREAT* feature is that it automatically turns itself off after it loses connection with the handset, after a period of time, so you can just drop it in the cupholder and go and it'll take care of itself. Just hurts my ear after an hour or so, and it either has to be 'clamped' that way or it feels like it's dangling. Perhaps some moleskin or some-such on the back could help. I'm planning to replace it with a Jabra BT500 (~$20 on eBay)."
2,Motorrola H300 Bluetoth Headset,"This item could be alot better than what it is made out to be. I've had this headset for now over a week, and I've had people whom I was talking to, tell me that they had a hard time hearing and understanding me. I'm not happy with this item at all, and plan on looking for something else."
4,Very durable,"This is an extraordinary little device. I forgot that it was in my pants pocket when I did the laundry 2-3 months ago, and even after going through a full wash/dry cycle, the H300 still works."
2,"Might be my ears, but","I need to keep my volume down at 1 or 2 out of 7 to prevent other caller from hearing themselves in an echo. I suggest buuying a bluetooth with an earbud, not a speaker."
3,It's a very good product for the price!,Just go for it if you don't have any Blue tooth devise!Work's well with my MOTO Q. I like the fitting on the ear as well.
4,like it,"I like this headset. Fits well if you adjust it according to instructions. Clear sound. Slightly on the quiet side, not bad. The best point is it takes AAA batteries so they are easy to replace. I had mine for 2 years before I lost it. Good price. Synchs well with my razor."
4,Good Except for Battery Life,"I will qualify this with the fact that this is my first Bluetooth headset, so I have no others to compare. I used the included battery for about two weeks before it just stopped working. It still made tones and turned on, but my phone could not find it. So there is basically no warning when it decides to quit. As for the actual life of a battery, I have no real data.My wife has a cheaper generic model that has crappy sound and too much background noise. She said mine was much better in quality. For me, the ability to use AAA batteries was a big selling point. No ""special"" expensive battery to buy, and if you recharge, even better. It is pretty basic, and that is what I need. Nothing very special for my phone, but if you have voice calling, it is supposed to be compatible."
4,Sleeper!!,"Wow,When I got this for Christmas I thought that I would just return it to get the Plantronix that I wanted, but I decided to at least give it a test run and boy was I suprised. I was set up in about 2 minutes and was voice dailing in another 10 seconds. I since have decided to keep it. Decent volume level, not great but no echo and I dont have to repeat myslef to anyone. After a few minutes you won't even know it's on your ear. My minor complaints are the volume level, occasional static (maybe 3 times in 3 weeks for about 5 seconds) and the standby feature doesn't conserve that much battery life. For 50 bucks you CANNOT go wrong. Better than the more expensive ones, stop reading and go buy it!!"
2,So so,"I've got this headset when they just came out and were still expensive, but hardly ever use it. The sound quality is really bad, and controlling the volume seems impossible. I always have to test it first to make sure the volume is high enough. If I needed to use a headset more, I would definitely get a better one."
4,GOOD FOR THE PRICE,The Motorola H300 is my 1st Bluetooth and it is quite good for the price and is worth 26.73 with tax. I haven't hasd any trouble it is simple to use with my Samsung U420. The sound quality is good though the head piece is abit big it is still well worth the purchase.
5,Not one hitch,"Bought this for my bluetooth capable Gateway NX560XL laptop computer and NOT my cell phone. So I can now watch videos in private. Works great. Vista recognized it right away and didn't have any conflicts what so ever. This is still the best price around, even the sunday circulars with all the electronic stores having sales can't beat the price."
3,Returrned it,"Pros:Low priceI like the AAA battery format - no chargerFast and easy setupGood audio - for meCons:Static. Everyone I spoke to also complained of echo. Having been subjected to this myself, I can see that little issue being very distracting in a conversation - and especially bad for business calls.In this case, you get what you pay for."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I've had this for two months, and while it is decent basic headset, there are major flaws. For reference's sake, I have this paired with a new Motorola L6 I got in May. The main power button is at best unreliable, and after reading reviews elsewhere I have come to the conclusion that this wasn't a faulty unit, it is endemic to the line--the power button is just faulty, twitchy, unreliable, whatever you want to call it.Additionally, I thought the AAA battery thing would be a great idea. Instead I've noticed that not only does the battery not last as long as advertised (assuming it's the battery and not the power button, which is not fun to determine), within six months of even theoretical normal usage the value over a charger solution vanishes. Batteries are expensive over time!In the end, you really do get what you pay for. The H300 is certainly cheap. But it also works like a cheap headset. I just ordered a new one to replace this, as I became so frustrated."
1,I'd rather pay a little more,"I used this headset for about 3 months before it broke. It never really felt secure of my ear, especially when I wore glasses. Spend the extra $20 and get one that is rechargable...you will get your money back in the first year."
3,Not fancy,"It works, it was inexpensive, it takes a triple A battery so I don't have to charge it. I find it sorta hangs off my ear a bit but I have small ears, really."
2,poorly made,I had this item for about 1 week and the ear hook came off and unfortunately it was loss. So now I have an ear piece that I can't use.
1,It's next to worthless,This is a cheap version and constantly drops the signal. I should have paid a bit more and then I'd have something I can use. This is not a good buy.
3,Just ok,"I had this headset for a few weeks but my dog chewed it up. I replaced it with the H700 and like it much better, but if you don't want to spend $80, this one's not bad.What's good: pretty good sound quality, at least on my end. A few times, the person I was talking to complained of an echo. I liked not having to charge it.What's bad: it didn't fit me very well. I wear glasses, and it always flopped around and felt like it was going to fall off. I'm not sure that would be the case for everyone, but I'd recommend trying on any headset before you buy it, because some will fit better than others."
1,Motorola makes horrible products!,"I've had this earpiece for less than a year and it no longer works.First, the battery cap started popping open frequently causing me to loose the connection with the phone. And now, the unit won't even power on.When it did work the sound quality was decent. However, people on the other end told me there was an echo and/or a signifigant amount of background noise heard.After having a Motorola Razr-which is possibly the worst cell phone ever produced-and this earpiece, I'll have to say that I will never buy another Motorola product.(These aren't the only Motorola items I've owned.)"
2,Not compatible with Dell laptops,This unit will not pair with Dell laptops that use Dell's built-in Bluetooth module. At first I thought it was a defective unit but a web search shows it's a known problem. The headset does pair well with my LG VX8300 phone and sound quality is reasonable. The AAA battery is a definite plus -- one less charger to deal with.
1,Don't loose the ear hook,"This headset was fine until a week later when the ""easily removable"" plastic ear hook vanished one day. God forbid they include an extra one or supply their stores with spares so that customers don't need to spend another $30 because they lost a 2 cent piece of plastic.Screw them all."
2,its okay,"This does not have the best clarity, but it works okay for the price I paid. If you have the money to invest in something a little bit more expensive and reliable, do so."
2,Jury still out--disappointed that it hasn't held up as I expected,"I bought this when I got my Razr last year and at first it worked okay. It still falls off my ear on a regular basis and I have to find wherever it gets tangled in my hair. The main button also doesn't work half the time to disconnect, reconnect or answer a call and I have to replace it already. I've never figured out how to use the ""three"" buttons to mute or try call waiting, maybe a different model will work better. Still, the only thing I expected was to not have to use a wired headset and that part did work here. I still haven't figured out the other mystery beeps other than low battery. Gets static-y at times but I think that is the Razr instead of the headset."
4,This is a GREAT STORY - not a concert,"I agree with the last review- I too don't understand the scathing reviews, it's almost like they are being planted by someone who doesn't want to see this sold to the fans. This isn't a concert, it's a great story told in an entertaining way by many people who were there. If you are at all interested in how the Van Halen brothers hooked up first with Mark Stone (he is interviewed in this DVD), then with the awesome David Lee Roth, then with Michael Anthony, then you will like this DVD"
1,Van Halen: Early Years,COMPLETE WASTE! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD. Grade A piece of junk with ABSOLUTELY no early V.H. Footage. What a joke!
3,Decent,"I enjoyed the commentary from the roadies, promoters and friends of the band. The video focuses on the beginning and has some very interesting commentary. Unfortunately, it does not have enough footage of or interviews with the band. There are no Van Halen audio tracks that accompany the video footage, which I found odd. For 5 or 6 bucks it's worth the investment."
1,Not what it's cranked up to be.,"I would have prefered a DVD that has the backing of the band, this most definatley hasn't because the footage is minimal and the music is non-existant. When Ozzy did his documentary from the beginning with his involvement it was great to learn off. But this DVD has left me thinking as to why it was released in the first place. I am disappointed that the advertisers have not been totally honest about this documentary. I really hope in future that there is a proper VH early day documentary which is made by VH and features more interviews with one of the greatest guitarists in the world. To talk about groupies and mad parties like on this DVD is nothing new I'm afraid as for copyright reasons, it's obvious that the makers couldn't go any further. Hopefully in the future an insight into the VH beginnings will be done properly."
1,It's true they are out dated and dead !,"I have to agree with a previous review, how many times do you listen to Eruption and all the other outdated stuff the VH duo were performing live for years before saying enough? As for other musicians there are tonnes out there now that have been way better then the VH duo for decades. The VH clan were top for around 2-3 years and then bang they were gone in a puff of smoke! All this documentary is trying to do is immortalise musicians from the dead. Dave Lee Roth and Vai/Becker have done much better stuff since anyway. No it's true, the VH early years is 25 years to late and is well and truely dead. So what was the point? Thats whats missing from this DVD, the people it's about are outdated and suck."
1,Trash,"This is nothing but trash. An insult to the mighty Van Halen, like all the bands that have copied them over the years they are now being exploited by documentary makers now. In any case, if the early years are so important why haven't Warner Brothers done this already? Van Halen haven't released a record since the nineties and their crappy VH3 was the worst selling record ever. A word for the makers; Who is interested in watching a DVD made up of photos, (repeated over and over again), alien background music, interviews that are edited to f*** and live coverage which lasts only seconds? They claim to be real fans, but the people being interviewed are literally unheard of, the Gene Simmons interview is barely audible and the museum is just plain sad. So my rating is trash - Keep your hard earned cash in your pocket."
1,dont waste our time release the us festival 1983 show.,"dont waste your time with this one .an insult to all vanhalen fans.please hurry up and release u.s festival 1983 on dvd.then w,ell all be happy .,,,, triumph did fantastic."
1,VAN HALEN WHO???? THE WHERE ARE THEY NOW FILE,Give me a Freakin brake. They should just retire. Eddie & Alex have proven without a doubt they can not work with (nor live with) any one. Not only have they gone thru how many singers now??Even Michael Anthony is leaving. That Sam & Dave actually went on tour with each other should tell Eddie and Alex they are not relevant musicians any more nor are they needed any where. There are plenty of better drummers and guitarists than these two stooges. Maybe they can do a eddie & alex casino reviwe show in Vegas some where to amuse them selves(how many times can one sit thru eruption??) but leave the touring to better bands and artists. Sam & Dave sounded better without the VH brothers. Eddie & Alex just go away- you are becoming as annoying as Waco Jacko. Oh yeah by the was stay far away from this gimmik of a doccumentry try Spinal Tap instead.
1,Worst Documentary Ever!!!,This was a joke of a DVD documentary. The participants were morons and the quality was pathetic. There is no interesting information to be found on this DVD. I wish I could reclaim the 70 minutes I spent watching it. Don't waste your time or money!!!!
3,Van Halen Documentary,"This was a good DVD, even though the band had nothing to do with it. It was very informative about how the band got started,touring and getting their first recording contract. A must have for the Van Halen fan. I can't wait for some new material from the boys or even an archieve live DVD."
1,This is so sad.....,"This could have been a great dvd. But, some how they screwed it up. Where is the music? Where are the interviews with Eddie, Alex, Dave and Mike? Everytime Ed is about to jam on his guitar, the scene is cut. Whats wrong with that picture? This could have been a great dvd. Im a huge VH fan, and have been ever since VH 1 came out. They should have a dvd with old concert footage, and mayby even old live videos, like Unchained, Dance The Night Away, and other live videos that us VH fans have been waiting for all these years. A major dissapointment for sure...."
5,"Great DVD, must see for true Van Halen Fans!!!!!","I have been waiting for this DVD for 20 years. I can remember when I just could not wait for the next Van Halen ""album"" (I almost said CD) to come out. This takes me back to that time. I have always been interested in how Van Halen started and this DVD takes you back to the very beginning and tells all the stories I have always wanted to hear.I was very entertained by the DVD and couldn't turn it off. I just wish there was more of it. I would love to hear more about the band. Maybe they will make another DVD to pick up where this one leaves off."
4,Early Years of Van Halen,"I think that this DVD is very good. Because it give you a look into the history of Van Halen. It's just what the title suggests , it's the early years. It told me things that I didn't know about this wonderful great band! If people are disapointed, they shouldn't be. It dosen't promise anythig that it don't deliver. It could've been longer. They should make another one bit a little more informative. But it's still very good. And I'm a diehard lifelong fan. I liked it and give it 4 stars. To each his own."
1,Should be minus stars.,Utter rubbish. Are these reviewers on medication? Should be minus stars cause this DVD anthology of Van Halen sucks!
2,"WB, what are you waiting for?????","OK, I get it now after all these years. WB (Warner Bro's) decided to hold all the early Van Halen footage in a vault hidden somewhere until the next life killing asteroid blasts the earth. Then evolution will recreate man and the new explorers will dig up the vault and find the vintage footage, watch it, and say, wow, what a cool band, lets sell this stuff on the black market. Thats about the time your gonna have to wait until you actually see a good DLR erra DVD, so, back to my 5th generation copied VHS to DVD US Festival from ""83""........"
1,van horrible,"do not waste your hard earned money on this! no van halen music, mostly still shots and every now and then youll hear edward or alex giving an interview through a tape recorder HORRIBLE"
1,Very suspicious,If you are considering buying this DVD you are probably very confused by all of these reviews. Half of them have one star and half of them have five stars - what is going on? It is worth noting that the very first review was a VERY detailed breakdown of the DVD contents and gave it a five star rating - however it was submitted BEFORE THE DVD WAS RELEASED! What does that tell you? Also every bad review is followed a day or two later by a contradictory rave review. I've never come across such blatant abuse of the Amazon review feature - it's clear that the DVD makers are just trying to sucker you into buying it using fake reviews while the true VH fans are disgusted by this lousy rip-off and stating it in the clearest terms. DO NOT BE FOOLED! DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!
2,What is up with the horrendous music on this DVD?,What in God's name is that revolting music that is played on this DVD? It's not Van Halen and it barely qualifies as music by any definition I've heard.
1,I have to be honest and say that I expected a lot more.,Well at least I haven't waited for 20 years to see this...! What are these guys on? The idea is good but the finished article falls well short of expectations. It's a shame the Van Halen camp didn't get involved in the making of this DVD because it could have been put together very nicely. Perhaps if the makers of this DVD negotiated some deal with the Band then another DVD could be released that really does kick *** and then everybody will be happy ! From looking back at all these reviews I really don't think this is the current case. In fact perhaps this DVD should be withdrawn.
4,Nice Job,"Overall, the DVD was pretty good. It had a quite thorough history of the Van Halen Brothers, their bands, and the members in each of their bands. A few things that could have been added or different, is that there is other band's music playing in the background-kinda weird and the other things is, they could have added some sound clips of how Van Halen progressed over the years. Even if you are a Van Halen fanatic, there is some information to be learned from this film. I would definately recommend it to anyone."
1,Somebody get me a doctor!,"Like previous reviews this is no way whats it's being cracked up to be. I expected much much more and felt ripped off when the final article was played on my system. This DVD has very little material of interest to fans. Van Halen are Legends and hopefully they will produce a proper history of the band through 'THEIR' words and not a load of nobodys tellings us stories just to cash in on them. Funny how so many people have agreed with the first review giving this DVD 5 stars, despite the fact that it hasn't been released to date. Really makes you think."
1,Everybody wants some.........,"But this don't deliver hunny! Avoid, keep ya hard earned dollars in ya pocket. 26 used up for sale says it all."
1,This really is a load of ****.,"It's funny how some reviewers say it's great????? Yet some reviewers say it's a disappointment! I have to go for the disappointment view! This DVD has definitely been over advertised and exaggerated and is therefore a waste of money. A true fan of Van Halen would prefer a lot more than this, especially as VH haven't even released a record for bleeding years. The early years Van Halen franchise must be mega now, and all the makers of this DVD are doing are giving you a layman's view of it all (whilst the copyright people can't get to them) but using their minor knowledge to cash in on VH. The trouble is you can't fool the fans and that's why this DVD is accumulating so many cr** reviews! AVOID!"
5,You need to see this ...,"Never mind the whining and complaining in other reviews here; this DVD is an indispensable part of the record for true VH fans, reported by the people who were there and made it happen when it all went down ... if you want the music, buy it; if you want the story too, this is an important part of it"
1,Total rip off.,"This DVD has been released earlier in the U.K, and as a massive fan of the DLR/Van Halen era, I found this DVD very disappointing. Firstly there is not a single Van Halen audio track throughout the whole 70-minute DVD, (copyright problems?) The backing music in it's place is an insult to Van Halen. The audio recordings alleged to be Alex and Mark, sound like they have been recorded secretly, and there is no way of knowing whether they are the real people. The video clips of VH live total about 25 seconds through the whole 70 minutes. The commentators seemed to go on more about the antics of DLR and the backstage madness of the band on tour, which had no real interest to me personally. I was expecting an insight into the music and one of most gifted guitar players in the world but it never happened. Hopefully a better documentary will be released with the band's backing in the future. But as for this, don't waste your money. It&#65533;s a hyped up load of rubbish."
1,Not what I expected,"The Van Halen early years are some of the most important as far as rock evolution goes and the change in the face of heavy metal and guitar playing as we knew it. Eddie Van Halen re-invented the guitar (quote by Frank Zappa). Therefore most of this DVD is useless as it doesn't cover the main drive behind the band, the guitar. I also found it disappointing that each time the DVD looked as if it was going to show some guitar ripping it just cut off. Therefore this can only be described as a gimmick and a rip off to the fans. The backing music is also an insult to the band cause it ain't as good as the music of the band. 'Ain't Talking about Love', 'Atomic Punk', 'Somebody get me a Doctor', 'Your no Good', and on and on and on. Therefore the makers of this DVD only did it to make money for themselves and have ripped off the band. Unfortunatly the only way at least at the moment the fans can get a real taste of the early Van Halen years is to listen/watch bootleg recordings."
5,GREATEST CD FOR A SOAP OPERA!!!,"You HAVE to buy this CD, is GREAT, it really captures the ""escencia"" of this great Soap Opera, it really portraits how great this soap opera is, and with that killing music, that just keeps you wondering for the love of your life, I really recommend it!"
4,Yee Haw Fun,"If you are sensitive about political correctness, live in the Mountains, have a Jeff Foxworthy for President bumper sticker or are missing your front teeth you may not like this video."
5,squidbilllies rocks,"this show is amazing. I never would've thought that the exploits of a North Georgia Mud Squid and his dysfunctional family of cephalopods coukld be so entertaining, but sure enough, just add pine cone liquor for chuggin and a truck boat truck for luggin(and maybe a giant foam dickhat) and you got yourself one hell of a meth fueled ride with Awesome Bill from Dawsonville in the pilot seat."
5,squid billies VOL 1 gibbery style oinkery at its best,For some good ole fashioned bent humor this is THE BEST of the squid billie's series.
5,Squidbillies,Squidbillies Season 1 will keep you laughing (and also confused at the same time) chronicling the ridiculous redneck antics of a group of hillbilly squids as the struggle to survive in the backwoods of middle Appalachia.
4,Yee-haw!!!,"From one of the creative minds behind Adult Swim's smash Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Squidbillies pushes the limits for offensiveness compared to some of the other shows on the Adult Swim lineup, and in some cases, even goes over it. It's all good however, considering that Squidbillies is mostly pure comic glee. The show revolves around an ex-con, hillbilly, talking squid named Early, who is re-united with his illegitamite son in backwoods redneck country. In between the series of mis-adventures that the two embark on, they deal with crack-pot family members, and a sheriff that has his share of problems. There's plenty of gross out gags and cliche' hillbilly behavior, and for the most part it's all frequently hilarious throughout. The animation style may not be everyone's cup of tea to be sure, but it suits the environment and the setting. As said before, Squidbillies is definitely not for everyone, but it keeps on supplying the laughs, and in that department alone, is worth checking out."
1,Ack,"I have read all the books in this series (except for Pride, which oddly has not been released yet). It it difficult to imagine that such a small book on such an interesting subject could be so completely tedious. It rarely deals with the actual subject of greed, but is more a reference to the 7 Deadly Sins as a whole. The author has chosen to use really, really big words, poor punctuation, and a myriad of endnotes to address this subject. Between the poor writing, the sloppiness of the intellectual examination on this topic and those pesky endnotes which require the endurance of a marathon runner to flip back and forth to, this book is like getting a hamburger without the meat, served by a sneering waiter."
3,Oxford Press Review - Greed,"This essay is very intelligent and well written. It takes a little persistence to read because of the heavy religious emphasis on greed and the rather abstract way of presenting its premises. I was expecting a more down-to-earth approach such as was taken by the author of ""ENVY"", but the essay is nevertheless interesting and thought provoking. I would not particularly recommend it to the novice reader in philosophical thought."
5,Happy Contractor husband,"These pants last longer than any other double knee pants my Contractor husband has tried, and I love the way he can brush sawdust off so easily and not bring it in the house stuck to his pants. They last longer because they don't need washing as often as other non-jean ""work pants"" he's tried. He has an uneven waist size, and it is very hard to find pants that are available in those sizes. When he wore suspenders to hold up pants that were a bit too large in the waist because he could not get his exact size, the suspenders would tear up the waist band. So, having these in all sizes also makes them last longer for him. He thought they would be too hot where we live, but they are not any hotter than his previous work pants. He says he will wear these as long as he can get them."
4,Tiny Tim - 'Live! At The Royal Albert Hall' (Rhino Handmade),"I'm giving this CD a four star rating because Tiny Tim has always managed to hold my full attention through out any(including this archive release)of his CD's I've ever had,listened to and/or borrowed.'Live!At...' is pulled from a never-before-heard performance that took place in October,1968.Sound quality may not be the absolute best,but it's acceptable.Tunes that I got a kick out of were ""On The Front Porch"",""Buddy,Can You Spare A Dime?"",Sonny And Cher's ""I Got You Babe"",""Frisco Flo"" and Mr.Tim's signature gem,none other than ""Tiptoe Through The Tulips With Me"".Good novelty fun-time music here for the taking."
2,"Good idea, but a piece of junk.","I thought this would be a cool little gadget to have in my pack on longer hikes or backpacking. On mine, the mirror and magnifying glass are almost impossible to open, you can either break a thumbnail, or use the screw drive on you Swiss Army Knife to try to open them. The thermometer is totally useless. The first time camping, I pulled the tool out of my jacket pocket to check the temp and it literally took nearly a half hour to adjust to the actual air temp. Then today I notice the thermometer battery is dead, and see here from other reviewers that the battery can't be replaced. Another item for the landfill? What a joke.Luckily I bought mine from REI so I can get my money back. For now I'll stick with my LED headlamp and compass, and find a better thermometer. Then again, we all know when it is hot or cold, right?"
2,Good design but not practical.,"I purchased one of these about a year ago the flashlight is still running good but temperature display is no more I actually emailed Highgear and they responded by saying the temperature battery could not be replaced so basically you're SOL so now it's basically a flashlight,compass and whistle. I would of been very satisfied with this product if you could replace the battery for the temperature gauge as well."
3,Can't replace battery for thermometer.,"Length:: 2:59 MinsHighgear Adventureplus. A small device with a compass, digital thermometer, mirror, magnifying lens, safety whistle, storage drawer, and LED flashlight in one small and stylish device. I have owned it for about a year and recommend it except for the NON replaceable thermometer battery."
4,Fun gift,"I purchased this as a gift for my parents. The only disappointing feature is the flashlight. You have to hold the button for it to stay on. Other than that, it's great. I would recommend it. Very light weight!"
1,Small and ineffective,"Ok...........the whistle,compass and flashlight works. Mirror and magnifiers are so small that they are virtually worthless & the Thermometer never has worked at all. Sorry, I expected something a little better and maybe bigger too.RF"
3,Not our favorite,"This is a cute book with pretty illustrations, but the story line seems a little strange to me. Angelina and Henry get left out alone all night while camping after they wander away from their campsite. There is a big storm and they get soaked. Pretty traumatic. But they just head back to their site the next day and things seem back to normal! I was waiting for a little more discussion after they returned...and maybe some warnings about not wandering away when you go camping!"
5,Arcadia Of My Youth Is DA BOMB!!!,Dude as cool as Legiverse goes goes This is the best!!! It's one of the best Space-Operas i've ever seen!!!!! So if your an anime lover/Ex-Space Pirate (like me!) you have gotta buy this!!!!!!!!! BUY BUY BUY!!!!!!! you should also watch and read the manga Galaxy Express 999 too bad it doesen't have Captin Harlock in it until their last stop but Maetel also joins up with Harlock and the crew!!! so BUY BUY BUY!!!!!!! *goes off to watch it for the 56th time*
2,See Xerox 470CX,Also See reviews on Xerox 470CX which apparently shares some of the mechanical guts of this printer as well.
1,well.... it prints... but...,it doesn't scan well at all. I can RARELY even vaguely make out a document after scanning it. It just doesn't work. I can receive faxes but sending them doesn't work all the time. My ancient HP prints as well as this thing. =( I won't buy a Lexmark again.
3,Not so bad,"Although this device has a lot of serious issues that ultimately make it a poor choice, it can do some things well. It's a good fax machine and does a good job scanning papers. Photo scanning is very poor. The WinXP drivers stink too. And the ink does run out too quickly (see refill kit!!). It does a good job printing photos though, especially in B/W. Does better than my HP 722C. The 722C does better text though.I'll never buy another Lexmark again. Boo."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER,"All I have had is problems with this printer, one month after buying it, it broke. I was sent a new printer... I still have problems with cable communication. It JUST WILL NOT print sometimes. I have had to uninstall and reinstall it twice now!!!BUYER BEWAREThis printer should be recalled, and yes i have XP, I think Lexmark should not have said it was compatible when it clearly is NOT."
4,Works with XP after downloading updated devices & drivers,"We run XP Pro and after doing an OS reinstall the Lexmark X63 started error out with ""Device Busy"". After a few attempts to troubleshoot the problem, we went to www.lexmark.com and on their site is two downloads available for XP. After installing downloads, the error message is gone and the X63 is back to itself.Summary of features: Printer and Fax will occasionally feed more than one page at time if paper is not loaded carefully (as with any Lexmark printer you have to 'gently' place the paper in the feeder). The scanner quality can take a few adjustments before getting the desired product. However, overall this has been a good product for us."
1,VERY disappointed!!!,"After MONTHS of e-mail and phone calls to support, and repeating the same basic steps, with them every time, IT STILL DOES NOT WORK!!! It gets better... we are on our third replacement, and STILL do not have a functioning unit. We get communication errors, lack of cartridge recognition, paper-feed problems, you-name-it. We have connected this machine to multiple computers, running win98, ME, xp pro... no matter! I believe it is just a poor design. Customer Support (in India?) tries, and they are polite, but have limited resources. AVOID THE X63!!! (This is a nice feature of Amazon, but they need to have the option of NO STARS or NEGATIVE STARS)"
1,Lexmark = junk in my bin,"Guys listen to this...out of 10 pages of text I rpint out 7 will get jammed up in the machine. I bought many lexmark products in the past because of its cheap price...but believe me, what you pay is what you'll get. The printer design is very wreckless. the feeder is very unbalanced; always tipping to the right. Since I am a computer technician I know how to fix some of the problemms. Its a hassle even for me to fix this piece of junk every week, I can't imagine for the regular folks at home. The fax dial design its idiotic. Does not promote a easy way for you use a callings card to dial out. If you purchase this product and want to send this through a phone card, you'll be sitting there for an hour just to send 2 pages. When I call for tech support, they deny that this is their problem. This is my last lexmark product. I would suggest everyone the same."
1,Major Headache - Braindead Tech Support,"The unit requires it's own drivers from Lexmark, Microsoft's won't work. Machine doesn't feed faxes properly, resulting in a CLR DOCUMENT JAM error every time, only clearable by unplugging the machine, but it will occur any time you use the scanning element - basically, if you want to scan, copy, or fax - you're [messed up]. As a printer, it's majorly slow, and the quality is very bad. Would rate it a 0 if it was allowed."
1,What a lemon of a printer,"My good ole' Lexmark X63 has been replaced twice(!) by Lexmark. I had multiple problems with it--was always ""busy"". Wouldn't scan, wouldn't print, wouldn't fax; the printer cartridge indicator is totally wrong--I paid for it at Comp USA and I WASTED my money. It usually prints from the internet and from MS Word or Publisher--it just would not do anything else. The Lexmark service reps were easy to get and they were extremely nice and helpful--the problem is in the X63. I have a friend in Bristol, Tennesee who has one and his works perfectly, but I could definately not advise anyone to purchase this printer."
1,How can you rate this product!,"I thought I had a workaround to get something from this product that involved cleaning my system of all traces of the X63 software and then reinstalling, but that too is failing me now. Buy this product, and it will sit silently in the corner, until you try to communicate with it or use it: Then it's still quite silent, except for the provoking and infamous X63 punchline: ""Device is busy: Try again later.""Fans of Basil Fawlty will empathize with the warnings that I have already given to this monstrosity; it won't be long before I go at it with a large club.For Lexmark X63 Multifunction Device read Lexmark X63 ""Malfunction"" Device...Buy it if you like breaking things with a big stick!"
1,'Device Busy'... no kidding...,"I have installed, uninstalled, and reinstalled this printer about 12 times in the past 5 months. No kidding, no exaggerating. It prints adequately, the fax always works fine (as it doesn't rely on a connection to the computer) and scanning and copying never worked for me.Anyone else who owns this printer and uses WinXP knows all about the 'Device Busy' screen. You see it, you swear, you run the clean utilty from Lexmark's website, and then you reinstall the software.Sadly, I cannot reinstall the software anymore. My computer no longer recognizes the printer. Very strange. Anyway, keep your eyes peeled for this dud on ebay Canada..."
2,Buy an HP instead,"When I wanted to upgrade my simple but trusty Compaq IJ900 I decided on the X63 which I purchased from the Lexmark website. I thought I would save some money this way but I discovered later that I could have bought it cheaper at Circuit City.At first I didn't have any problems with the unit. All functions worked well for about 6 months even though I had to tape photos to a piece of paper to scan them. After 6 months the scanner stopped working altogether and soon after that the PC scan and control program stopped working. Even after uninstalling and reinstalling this function never worked again. On a positive note the print functions have always worked and the unit will copy but only from the keypad. I have also used the fax but, once again, only from the keypad. After 18 frustrating months with this thing I am finally going to ditch it and get the HP I should have bought in the first place."
1,Horrible device! Never works!,"Do NOT waste your money with this printer. While the customer service is excellent, you'll be spending your life on the phone trying to sort out this constantly malfunctioning machine."
3,Lexmark x63,"I have had my x63 for about 2 years. It ran great with Windows ME but when I upgraded to XP Professional, it had some issues. Completely uninstall the printer, restart after EVERY step and clean your registry of all Lexmark items. There is an updated driver at lexmark.com. After a few hours of persuation, I got it to work just as wonderfully as ever. I love being able to scan stacks of documents to pdf files, and I use it to fax and copy every day. It is a great workhorse if you DON'T DISCONNECT THE USB CABLE, EVER!!! Otherwise, it's back to square one. If you have any quality problems, check your resolution settings. I also bought one for work, that one has never had a problem, even with XP Pro."
1,What a hunk of junk,"I know this thing has been discontinued, but I'm hoping nobody will waste their money on a used one. Since day one, this thing has been a nightmare. When it works, which isn't often, it does nothing well.Everything it can do, it does poorly and slowly. Also, it uses ink like an SUV uses gas. Stay far away from this thing. I'll never buy another Lexmark product again."
2,"Good Idea, bad results","The simplistic rating system ruins all the book: (example: a song that reached #1 one week and stayed on chart only 12 or 13 weeks is ranked well above a song that couldn't get #1 but stayed 9 weeks in #2 and total 42 (almost a year) in chart.) It doesn't show the real impact of a song seen through time. A lot of big hits are left out and then, the other compilations that depend of it lack of credibility. The picture selection could have been more large, but the idea of a ranking of this 45 years is great."
3,Adorable but...,"...it's quite heavy. My nine month old loves to pick it up by its hat. However, when she waves it around she comes very close to smacking herself in the head with it. I think it's only a mater of time before it happens, so I supervise her play. I'm not sure I would buy this again."
1,Not Impressed,"I got this light yesterday with some other stuff. I was very let down to see that the output was barely detectable. I have other Fenix lights and have been pleased with them. Maybe this one is defective. The foam ring at the bottom is also not very impressive. I suppose it's there to keep the battery from rattling but it's inevitable that it will deteriorate and come apart eventually, so that is not of the quality that I expected.I'm returning it for a refund. And this will be the first thing I've ever returned to Amazon."
2,faulty designed circuitry,"The Fenix P1 may seem to be a marvel, due to its compact size, turns out to be a dud. The circuit board controls power regulation however if the power of the battery is below 70%, the LED brightness immediately drops from a cool 100-90% to a very weak/dim glow (I would say about 10-20% of full brightness).Initially the contact seems very glitchy when using less-than-full but still usable CR123A battery, however this was due to the power regulator circuit.Some users have had to remove the foam ring at the bottom of body of the light, so that the contact would be improve.. Doing this will not improve the contact.. It only makes the battery rattle around inside..Anyway, this was a waste of money.. My dad's flashlighter combo was actually brighter, running on a CR3023... sad."
3,"Five Stars, if not for graphic Footage","This is really a well-made and important piece on one of my favorite composers. I was going to have my eight-year old son watch it with me. I'm glad I didn't. The film maker included very graphic and disturbing film images of dead and dying children to emphasize the horrors of war. I really believe this hurt the film. The horrors of war could have been depicted in a way that did not draw us too far away from the subject matter, which is a great composer and his music. At the end, it was the gruesome images of tragedy and destruction that stayed with me, not the man and his transcendent music. I'm not against powerful images and shaking things up when necessary, but the film maker, for all of his good work, crossed the line to the point where his creation left me angry and disturbed, not enlightened and inspired. A few substituted scenes could have made the point and still kept the focus on the composer and his work. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise."
3,Mostly Interesting,"Mostly interesting documentary nearly ruined by the sporadic and utterly unnecessary use of exceedingly disturbing current-day images of dead, battered babies and emaciated children with flies crawling inside their sores. The filmmaker is making the point that RVW's music often reflects the harrowing human condition. Fine. But we don't need a sledgehammer to the head--swung several times--to comprehend this!"
4,Laughable Reviews for what is Common sense,"Some of the reviews here are just laughable. The goal for using this program isn't just about ""looking good."" For some, its actually about developing strength and power that can be translated into specific sports. Common sense dicates that there is a direct correlation between this squat program and the caloric intake recommended. If you are actually dedicated to this program, and grind out those reps with increasing poundages, you have no choice but to eat because they will make you brutally hungry. If you aren't hungry from doing them, well then you aren't putting in the work necessary. Its that simple."
5,No One Is Too Old To Learn how to Train,"Hey man I just got to tell you that reading Super Squats is the best thing I've done in my training. I am 54 yrsd old and weight lifting/powerlifting is my hobby since the late 70's! About 20 yrs ago I heard about multi rep squats and I did them once in a while. However, Super Squats has reminded memof something I had been neglecting to do; TAKE BREATHS IN BETWEEN EACH REP not just grunt/grind them out till ya get to the end of the set.How to do them and how to find out how much weight to use, I'm going to STRONGLY suggest the book be read and digested! You will NEVER regret it if you are serious about getting results in every aspect of training.(UPDATE)Yes you will get results but I must say that unless you are a 98lb newbie it doesn't seem posible to gain 30lbs in just 6 weeks, IMHO! this book seems to be written for an guy, or girl who REALLY needs to put on some serious weight."
1,What a joke this book is.,"Here is the outline. Do one set of 20 reps with a weight that you would have a hard time doing ten reps with. Do a set of pullovers, drink a gallon of milk a day AND supposedely gain 30 lbs in 6 weeks. Of FAT since you can not gain this much in muscle in that short a time.This book is outdated in terms of diet, programing and offers NO guidance on the proper technique to squatting.Glad I did not spend $5 on this book. You can read the entire book in 30 minutes if you skip the 75% of the history of strongmen."
5,The only book needed for size and strength,Just buy the book and apply the methods. You will be shocked..bize
3,it works,"The system given in this book works. A gallon a day and squat. You are guaranteed to add muscle. Sure you are going to get fat but you are sure to get substantially stronger. My complain about this book is that the squat technique is not given correctly. I would have been willing to pay more for a detailed description on the squat technique and programming. The book is short on substance, but the truth is that the idea that is given in the book works fine. You are left to figure out the details yourself, unfortunately."
5,Super Squats Solid Advice,I have been training for years and for the past year I have been training with my 15 year old son. I was looking for a program that we could follow that would increase out strength. Since I am in my mid forties and my son is 15 I wanted something that would be a challenge for him without causing me to burnout.This book offered solid advice. After years of trying all kinds of programs it was good to read a book that goes back to the basics and presents them in a clear cut entertaining way.
3,Not for advanced trainees,"I bought this book hoping for some unique insights into weightlifting. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with Super Squats to say the least. One good point the book does make is the need for maximal effort to achieve maximal muscular gains. Super Squats applies this technique to the 20 rep squat. It should be noted, however, that more advanced trainees already put an incredible amount of intensity into EVERY exercise of every workout. Thus, this book does not provide an advanced trainee nor even an intermediate trainee with much insight from a training perspective. I think that if you can already parallel squat more than 400 pounds, you should strongly consider not buying this book. If you are still a beginner, this book might be a good starting point in your quest to learn to apply maximal intensity to every exercise. It will also teach novice trainees that squating is important.That's how I see it anyway..."
2,20 rep squats - lifted from Joseph Hise 1932 Strength Magazine,"Joseph Hise came up with this in 1932, its not the ""20 reps"" that builds the mass its the squats.... he packed on the pounds and made a name for himself by DEADLIFTING and SQUATTING thats it... Squat is the king/key exercise for releasing testosterone naturally."
2,"squats are great, but this book advocates you do it to often","I tried this program in earnest. While it is true that squats are the best exercise for overall strength, it is impossible to grow on a program that call for extreme squatting three times a week. I did not grow at all."
5,SUPER SQUATS IS THE ULTIMATE FOR SERIOUS HUGE MUSCLE!,"This book has a great training program. Those breathing squats turns a skinny stick man into a massive incredible monster! Drinking milk will do wonders for everyone. It is called the perfect protein. Push it and maybe you will gain more than 30 lbs. of muscle! A man called J.C. Hise gained 29 lbs. of weight in a month! It works for women too. After this workout you might as well throw away your shirts! Not only because you will outgrow them, but you won't want to ever cover your chest ever again! Men and women would want to go topfree always! This is a 10 in every sense! Randall brings the goods!"
4,Squant N' Milk,"Google: 'Squats and Milk program' and you get the same routine that's in this book but FREE. I own the book and liked it BUT the only problem i have is the high frequency recommended. It says to start with a minimum of 150% of your bodyweight for the squats, do them Mon-Wed-Fri and add 5lbs at EVERY squat workout. This is simply TOO MUCH. I have done this routine and somehow managed to finish it and it DOES work, but in the years since then i've learned and had better gains from taking the routine and modifying it by starting with around 50-60% of your 1 rep max in the Squat and starting from there.DON'T 'start with your ten rep max and get 20 reps no matter what!' like the book suggests or you WILL burn yourself out and quit the routine after a few weeks.AGain, this book is a great read and a classic for anyone who is 'into' lifting weights, BUT you can just Google 'Squats and Milk program' and get the same thing for free ;-)"
5,Best ever,After reading Super Squats I feel that it is a must reasd for young athletes. It is for every coach at any level. More coaches should get thier hands on this book. It will get the hard gainers going and the superior athletes an extra advantage. The high rep squat is the only program for the one that wants to gain weight or someone who wants to get to the next level.

3,prepare for the intensity.,The Super Squat technique will not only help build muscle but teach intensity that may otherwise be hard to learn. Go for it!
3,"Good history, not so good training advice","A very entertaining, well-written book. However there is no mention of lactose intolerance in the book. I tried drinking a lot of milk and ended up doubled up in agony for 5 hours in the bathroom screaming in pain. 20 rep squats will be too intense for many of you all they caused me was sleepless nights because they upset my body so much."
1,SuperSquats = Super Injury,"Me and a couple of buddies tried this program. Only one of us escaped without injury. The one that did make it through came out only 5lbs heavier and squattin with 20 extra pounds. That much gain just isnt worth the risk. My buddy that got injured hurt his back not usin a belt like the program said and then i got so fatigued towards the end of my set ( the sets used in this book are twenty rep sets using the weight you use to do 10 reps on, crazy huh? ) that i dropped the bar on my back. That hurt and it took me out. Such a dangerous way to do squats isnt good."
1,no way,the smell was waaaaaaaaaaay to strong and all the flowers fell apart when i opened the package so i didnt even get to hang it....i just kinda sprinkled them around the car
2,Very soft lens.,"I was first in line to buy this lens when it first came out. It is a very convenient lens for everyday shooting. However, I was extremely disappointed with how soft the lens is. The center of the frame can be sharp, but there is a rapid falloff to softness in the corners. I wish Nikon would update this useful zoom with better optics. Their 18-200 VR is a great lens for DX sensors, but this one for full-frame cameras isn't worth bothering with."
5,Review Nikon 24-120mm lens with AutoFocus and VR,I purchased this lens for the vibration reduction. My D80 came with the same lens without VR and I take a lot of pictures where flash is not allowed. This lens fills the bill perfectly.
3,Fair Performance,I rented this lens over the weekend for a locatio shoot. Overall it did alright except for the vignetting when I used the wide angle 24mm. It's not as sharp as I expected it to be but I like that it does not distort the image so much when used in wide angle.
2,Loose lens barrel,"I purchased two of the above lenses and both had inner barrels, (the coaxial mounted inner barrel which moves when zooming) that had too much slop in the clearances. On both lenses, I could grab the end of the lens and move it back and forth from side to side and up and down. Both lenses were made in Thailand. I will attempt to find a store selling the Japanese made units. Hopefully they will have better fit and finish."
4,Least expensive VR lens?,"I got this lens used from a friend, and am overall satisfied with it. For its role as a low light lens, it is adequate. It doesn't focus as close as I would like in some applications, but then, it wasn't designed as a macro lens. The current photo on Amazon of this lens is wrong, I believe. I use this lens a lot for photographing people at conventions/banquets, with flash. If you can't afford the 18-200mm VR, then by all means, get this one."
2,Beware of the error!,"UMM, Amazon?? Are you there?? You made a HUGE TYPO on this one! The max aperture is f/3.5, not f/2.5!! BIG DIFFERENCE!I am not a lens expert - not by a long-shot. But, I can say that I wish I had researched this lens better before I bought it. Since purchasing it in January, I can say that I have read some rather poor reviews of it online. The numbers make it look like this is the perfect do-everything lens, especially with the VR. Such is not that case because I am left longing for more sharpness, a larger aperture, better zoom, etc.Here is a link to read a review: [...]"
2,"Worth reading as a general survey, but not sufficient by itself","I found this book to be of barely acceptable editorial quality, and the writing can sometimes be infuriatingly disjointed. A disappointment, considering the book was authored by a Jesuit. Nevertheless, I cannot bring myself to completely reject it, owing to this book's brevity and lack of competition. I was glad to have read a brief survey of Philippine history just to get the larger structural elements in place, but because the writing is so uneven, the book's value is severely limited, even as an introductory text. For that reason, I would not recommend it for instructional use. Yet, if you devote an afternoon to this book, you'll at least have a beginning as a reader in Philippine history, but it cannot be overemphasized that further reading is a necessity."
4,A fine resource for all Sibe owners or those considering.,"Heavy emphasis on background & breeders of SibesEach dog breed needs a similar book that fills the dog owner withpride and convinces him(her) that they have selected thequintessential dog to own. It also is valuable in pointing out some ofthe unique problems of the animal i.e. wanderlust, digging,behavioral quirks difficulty training as well as the endearing featuresof the breed. Perhaps too much time is placed on the ""begots"". Itintroduces you to the major ""players"" breeders of Sibes and has anexcellent chapter on the breed standards. The numerous photos aresomewhat repititious since all good Sibes are beautiful and it is hardto see the subtlties in black and white when talking about copperand other hues. Spins a great narrative about the ""serum run"" andthe legendary ""Togo"" which I have made into a children's storywhich is loved by my grandchildren."
4,Love it! :),"I love the thing! its very easy to hit but if you hit on the wrong spot of your hand it burns a little, but it rarely happens. totally worth the money."
1,Too hard!!!,"This is ball is far too hard!! I read other reviews saying the same, but since I was buying it for adults to play with I thought it would be okay. Guess again ..."
2,Just so so,The ball is perfect but the rope that comes with it after just a couple hours of it being up for the kids the rope completely unraveled making a mess but even worse a safety hazard for children.
2,Katharine Hepburn: Film Collection,"Not quite what I thought it would be...altho, that was my fault. I would have liked more than the 'movie trailers'. But, for the price, I got what I paid for. The picture didn't explain exactly what I was getting."
2,"Just ""OK""","I would not purchase this CD again. It contains a collection of Trailers of Hepburn's movies. If all one needs is a list of Hepburn's movies, one can look at numerous web sites for free.Just my opinion."
1,Dissappointed Hepburn fan,I like many others I found that instead of this collection containing movies all there are on the DVD are trailers for a bunch of Miss Hepburns movies. What a disappointment. :(
4,Good solid stand but not worth the price,"I recently joined a band with many trombones so I see many types of stands. Overall the Hercules is a very sturdy stand, hands down. It does have a few downsides though. It does not collapse down into a manageable length, the leg lock knob does not tighten the legs although the rubber feet on the legs hold the legs in place. It holds the trombone at an angle by the slide brace rather than sliding the bell over the stand - a feature which they advertise as better for the horn, but I don't see as an advantage. Having the horn sit at an angle takes up more space in what is usually a tight spot. The mechanism for holding the slide brace is not vertically adjustable so it holds the horn at an even sharper angle. Overall it is not a bad stand but I definitely would not have paid the full $55.00 price for it - I got it for about $28.00 plus shipping on Amazon. Without the lower price option, one of the other type stands would have been my choice."
4,"Great for older, press-fit trombones","Many reviews comment on the difficulty of picking your trombone up from this stand. Personally, I have not found it difficult.There are 2 large advantages to this stand:1.) Outstanding stability and balance. Unlike the hamilton-style stands, this stand simply will not tip over, even when it's given a pretty good shove.2.) If you have an older trombone where the bell does not actually screw into the slide (such as those manufactured by Conn or Olds), the Hamilton stands are not safe due to the insecure attachment between the bell and slide sections. This problem is completely resolved with this stand.All in all, a good stand. Great if you have an older trombone. Probably not worth replacing a hamilton if you already have one for a more modern trombone."
4,Science Fiction Roots,"In this collection of science fiction short stories and stories about science fiction short stories, Isaac Asimov once again writes with that distinctive style of his. Mr. Asimov has always had a clarity of thought and expression that few have been able to match. Wether it be the 500 word essay or 200,000 word novel, Mr. Asimov is able to grab your interest in the opening sentences of each story. This book is a combination of science fiction shorts and essays, some memorable, others. . .""interesting"". Although Gold is billed as Isaac Asimov's ""final"" science fiction collection, I wouldn't be surprised if more undiscovered and unpublished works of Isaac Asimov were to come out in the years ahead. Though not his best material, you'll like this book if you like Asimov."
3,Not his best at all,I am a highly devoted Asimov fan and probably always will be I am a little disapointed in this volume. I'm sure every hardcore Asimov fan will agree when I say that this volume didn't seem likeAsimov took the time to make as great an impact as he normally does. Usually his writings draw you into a state of succlusion from the outside world and you become completely unaware of what is really happening. With this book it was simply not the case. I reccomend reading Magic if you don't know whatI'm talking about.
1,Waste Of Money,"What a waste of money!!! I was expecting movies such as ""day at the races"" and ""Duck Soup"" but 5 DVD's consitsed of complied ""bits and pieces"". They even put ""audio only radio excerpts"". I am returning this crap!"
1,Wish there had been reviews for this before I purchased,"As it has been mentioned by the others who have now reviewed this -This 'collection' is not what it was described to be originally.Fortunately, for those who are looking now - the description hasbeen changed to reflect the true nature of this collection.Unless you need absolutely everthing every printed and or recordedabout the Marx brothers -- even the relatively uninteresting, this is not for you."
1,Misleading,"When one sees a box set saying it is a Marx Brothers Collection, you would expect it to BE A MARX BROTHERS COLLECTION. This is not a movie collection, but a collection of clips and uninteresting, unless you want personal information and other facts, DVD.When I go to a site which states it has a certain collection, I think, an explanation should be included, if this is not a collection of movies."
1,Don't be deceived by the DVD title,"This isn't a collection of movies. I also bought this as a Christmas present for my husband, because Amazon implied it wasa collection of movies. It isn't. I'm also out the cost of return postage. I think Amazon was very deceptive in the way they presented this DVD collection."
1,Another unhappy viewer,"As with others who purchased this DVD set, it turned out to be exceedingly disappointing. Not only was the description completely misleading, several of the DVDs are unplayable.I will be requesting a refund. As an act of good faith, Amazon should pull this product (or describe it accurately) and allow other misled customers to return it for refund."
1,Junk!,"I knew what this set was supposed to be. I think it was clear in the description. Why anyone would think that this is a collection of movies, I have no idea. I wanted this set for what is in it. But....The damn things won't play! I tried to run them on two domestic players, a car player, and a region-free player. Nothing! They are NOT Region Two discs. They appear to be Region Zero (playable on all players worldwide), but they were produced very poorly and will not get past the menu screen.So, how can I give a fair review to something I can't see? Easy! It's junk, pure and simple. Just plain unusable junk.And what's up with Amazon charging a restocking fee?!? They're going to sell this junk to somebody else? Why? IT'S JUNK!In case you don't know this Passport company, maybe the fact that they are part of Madacy will give you a clue. Remember the old days of VHS? Ever buy a Madacy product? 'Nuff said.JUNK!"
1,A total pointless buy,I bought the set for my boyfreind for xmas. The dvd did not work on his MAC dvd computer let alone my dvd player. How could these dvd's not work??!?Enough said-I wasted my money on this
1,Not the movies.,"This collection does not include any of the Marx Brothers movies. Fortunately there are several collections now available. ""The Marx Brothers Silver Screen Collection"" (44.99 at Amazon) has about half of their feature pictures, specifically these:(The Cocoanuts / Animal Crackers / Monkey Business / Horse Feathers / Duck Soup)The other half are available in a collection called ""The Marx Brothers Collection"" ($39.99)(A Night at The Opera/A Day at The Races/A Night in Casablanca/Room Service/At the Circus/Go West/The Big Store)The only other picture that they did was ""Love Happy"",($13.48) and that is not included in these collections.Those are all very good prices, and any real fan will certainly enjoy the quality of the video/DVD."
1,MARX BROTHERS COLLECTION,TALK ABOUT DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING. I WAS EXPECTING FIVE OF THEIR BEST MOVIES AND RECEIVED SOME GARBAGE THAT WAS BETTTER KEPT ON THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR! HOW ABOUT PROVIDING US WITH THE REAL DEAL?
1,UK DVDs and Videos Not Viewable in the U.S.,"Although Amazon UK appears to have both Marx Brothers DVDs and Video tapes in stock, note that the DVDs are encoded for area 2 (Europe/Africa) and are not viewable on US DVD players. Similarly, the video tapes are PAL format (European TV) and will not work for US TVs, which are NTSC format.This is really a shame. In these troubled times, the US *needs* some Marx Brothers movies."
1,Not what is implied,"Just got the set (for a Christmas gift), and was upset to see that it's NOT a collection of Marx Brothers films, as I had thought.The description on this item is vague, and SHOULD have been more specific as to content. It's already being sent back, and I'm none too thrilled to be stuck with the shipping costs..."
1,worst marx collection,"I can't tell you how disappointed I feel after waiting a month and finally receiving the Marx Brothers Collection. Like everyone, I tried my best to research the complete box set prior to purchase. But when it arrived I knew I'd been had. NONE of the great Marx Brothers Films are in this weak collection. It's more like outtakes and radio bits, plus a silly pilot for you bet your life. I hoped that at least disc one would have something worth seeing but it wouldn't even play on either of our DVD players. This is a great marketing hoax. Buyer beware!!If you want to buy the collection of movies...look elsewhere. Amazon should put out a warning with this sale as I believe they've been hoodwinked as well."
2,"Not terrible, but not especially great either","The trailers, old clips and radio show are all interesting and good for the collection of the diehard fan. I bought mine for $20 so you may want to search around if you're interested. For those who really want the movies, skipping this set will not be any big loss."
1,Uggh!,"I too am a monster fan of the Marx Brothers, had been looking for a Brothers collection, and was taken in by this set. Uggh. As stated by others, it's lousy. Do not waste your time or dough!"
1,No movies in this collection,"We tryed to watch this at christmas. It was unwatchable. Instead of getting my 13 yr. old son interested in classic Marx Brothers, it turned him off. All clips, except most of the time you are looking at a still sceensaver between clips. We couldn't get through even one dvd."
1,Groucho Garbage,All the Marx brothers are rolling over in their grave over this collection of trash. I was hoping that this would be anything more than it is ... GARBAGE.I bought these for my husband and he was so dissapointed ... a pure and utter waste of money ... they don't even make good coasters.
4,A tiring but invaluable resource,"""Juran's Quality Handbook"" is a massive tome of great value to quality professionals. It is not smooth reading, nor is it the type of book that can be read quickly. Indeed, to maximize the usefulness of this ""Bible,"" I suggest reading one or two sections per month and try to apply the concepts as much as possible. It will improve one's effectiveness as a quality professional. The book covers every facet of quality I could imagine, so there certainly is no lack of material. I give it 4 stars due to an abundance of long, run-on sentences. This complicates the book unnecessarily, making the reader review sentences twice in many cases!"
4,Encyclopedia of Quality Management is readable too,"Joseph M. Juran is among the founders of modern quality management, so his handbook, after several editions, should be a great reference. And it is. It covers everything from statistics to people, countries to industries to methods. How to think about it and how to do it. And readable too. Now, at over 1800 pages (48 chapters, 5 appendices), this is not a book to read from beginning to end. But it's much more than an encyclopedia to sit on your shelf. Think of each chapter as a readable textbook. Choose your topic and read a chapter. Novices will get a complete introduction; professionals can use the organized and complete explanations to refresh their own understanding or to explain quality management and improvement concepts to others."
2,Author's Ego,"Barbara Held is to be applauded for writing a thin little book with just a few pages of insight, much repetition and a lot of filler. This ain't your momma's chicken soup!"
5,Indy before Indy,This book is a hoot! Great for O'Brian fans and those who've never read him.Not as dense as the Aubrey/Maturin. A rollicking adventure of a young boy seeing the far east and getting into all kinds of adventures. Reminding me of an Indiana Jones movie.
3,The Road to Samarcand- An Adventure,"Early Patrick O'Brian-- a good adventure story with signs of his later mastery, but too easy solutions to apparently unsolvable problems. Enjoyable however."
3,"A nice diversion, but not in the same league as O'Brian's best","I will admit it, I am an ultimate Patrick O'Brian Aubrey/Maturin series fan boy. I have read that series of novels repeatedly and enjoyed each one every single time. When I learned of this book I immediately bought it.It was disappointing in comparison to the Aubrey/Maturin books. I agree with the reviewers who have characterized this as a 'boy's book'. The adventure is wildly implausible, the characters are much more heroic cardboard cutout than his later protagonists and the dialog (something he was clearly gifted with later in his career) seems false.I am not sorry that I read it, as I said, it was more of a quest than a choice for me, but don't expect the same experience as you have had (or hopefully will have) with his later works. Buy a copy for your favorite 12 - 14 year old nephew, it will be a great introduction to Patrick O'Brian for him, then read it carefully before you put it in the gift wrap."
3,Foreign Devils on the Silk Road,"But alas, it is really a boys' story. Though a precursor to Aubrey, including taifoons, ships, excentric scientists, adventurous overland travel in pursuit of something mysterious, it does not reach the appeal of the masterful series.The research into the China reality of the time is not up to the standard of his later work. The characters are typical boy story cliches, the plot is rather simplistic, the diaologues are not what they would have been 20 years later. Not on the level of the short stories and novels of the same time either.If you are an O'Brian aficionado, read it for completeness. If not yet, better start elsewhere."
2,Not typical O'Brian's,"The main interest in this book is to see where O'Brian started -- hard to believe how much better a writer he became with the Aubrey-Maturin series. Perhaps it is because he was writing for teenagers in ""The Road to Samarkand"", and that isn't his genre. If you want to read a really entertaining kid's adventure set in the same part of the world, see if you can get hold of ""Big Tiger and Christian"" by Fritz Mühlenweg. It would be great if this tale, (originally published in 1954, reprinted in 1966, 1971) were to become available again, in paperback. However, your library may have it -- check it out!"
2,don't gamble on this book.....,"knowing what a great author Miranda Jarrett is, I had high hopes for this Harlequin Regency. Sadly, the book does not live up to expectations.First-while I'm no stickler for historical accuracy-gigantic inaccuracies cannot be avoided here. The whole gist of the story-three vicar's daughters inheriting a gaming hell is implausible enough. But when added into the fact that they decide to actively run the hall themselves? The author completely asks you to suspend disbelief with the storyline but doesn't supply enough likable characters to have you do so.Finally and most importantly-like another reviewer stated-the hero and heroine are just plain unlikeable. Both are used to getting their own way, stubborn to the point that they risk others good names with their brash decisions-and just too transparent on where the relationship is headed.Save your money on this one.1.5 stars."
4,good camera,My school has 2 of these camera's and I use them quite often for school dance pictures and field trips. This is an easy to use camera. I am going on a trip this week and i am going to be purchising this camera... It's worth it!
2,Get the model that doesn't store on floppies.,"I bought this camera because of the great features and used it for around 6 months. It would still be everything I need except that floppy discs are now becoming obsolete. My husband got a new computer that doesn't even have a floppy drive (as most new computers don't), so we can't even use the camera now.Luckily, I receieved as a gift the similar but newer model that takes mini CDs. I know those will be around for a while!The camera has good features and Sony is a very reputable brand, but honestly, you'll need to get a new one soon. Get the model that accpets CDs or connects to your computer in a way that won't be outdated soon."
2,Spoiled Realization of a Good Idea,"I everyone, I'm a seller at one of the famous auction sites. While the overall features were improved, the most important one was REMOVED! I mean manual focus ring... I have to work with small items and need to focus on paricular part of the object i'm shooting. THIS CAMERA FOCUSES ON WHAT IT WANTS TO! The pictures are totally out of focus where you want, but perfectly fine where the camera ""sees"" them. I hope it is not too confusing. My advice? Get yourself either FD-83 or Sony 707 Digital Camera."
3,Dark Pictures,I don't know if three is an accurate rating but almost all of my indoor pictures are dark. I have to be three feet or less to get a good picture. Are all cameras like this?Otherwise I am completely satisfied with the camera LJM
4,:),"The cover copy is misleading, I'm afraid. What happens in this story is that after Syndi buys an old dollhouse at a yard sale and Marshall buys a doll to go in it, the doll disappears and a new girl, Maggie, appears who looks almost exactly like it! What is the connection between Maggie, the dollhouse, Maggie's house which looks just like the dollhouse, and Maggie's parents, who look way too old to really be her father and mother? This is a fast-paced, exciting, and slightly creepy story."
5,cd is fabulous....live show is out of this world!,"im a huge funk fan and i was turned on to this cd...great songs, and great production...not your usual stale funk cd..very creative..i can't stop singing these songs..then i saw the band in concert last week in toledo with everlast, and they blew my mind...best live band i've seen.... can't wait to hear more...."
2,"Buy alternative product, excell coil for Dodge V-8's","Buy alternative product, excell coil for Dodge V-8's 1991 t0 2003Older Dodge V-8's need more spark voltage than this product can provide. Buy the Excell super coil instead which increases available voltage from 32K to 42K and your engine will perform much better."
5,An excellent read!!!,"I have read Peretti's work before (Piercing the Darkness and This Present Darkness), however I really enjoyed this book. This book has so much going on in it, that it really captivates you and keeps you hooked. The relationships and the themes are current and they make you look and think about subjects like a abortion with a whole new view. I think this book would make an excellent study book, I was hoping there were discussion questions, but alas I could find no It has some thought provoking passages in it, such as when the title character John is in the shopping mall. I thought the way the author blends the subject of mindless shoppers and their need to fill something that is missing in their lives was so right to the heart of today's society. I think this book would be an excellent choice for a book club, to study as a group. I highly recommend picking this book up and read it slowly and absorb the food for thought contained in its riveting pages."
4,Very well writen book,"The book is brilliant. Perhaps there are a few beliefs I don't agree with, but all in all I loved it!"
4,"Good book, but be patient","Prophet is an excellent book, in the second half. It begins very slowly, with just a lot of backround info, but picks up a lot and makes up for it's sad beginning in the second part."
5,Another great book by Frank Peretti!!,"This is the third book I have read by Frank Peretti, and all have been great. The only thing that disappionted me in this book was that Peretti didn't make note that abortion is murder, no matter how you put it. But it still was a suspesful action thriller."
3,Caution,I have loved everyone of Peretti's books that I have read but I had to put this one down half way through. I was reading it when I was in my mid teens and it was too much for me. I am sure I will read it and love it when I get a little older. Just one word of caution: this book is not for children or the faint at heart.
3,"Great topic, good story.","Frank Peretti has established himself as an excellent writer of fiction (see This Present Darkness), as well as non-fiction (with the Wounded Spirit). In this book he tackles some hot social issues through the story of a man's journey of awakening to who he is and what he stands for. The social comments regarding the media, and the way news is spun to meet the agenda's of the (usually liberal) owners of the media outlet, is right on the money and reflective of what we have seen recently in the 2000 Presidential race. In this story, the topic is abortion rights, and the plot involves a news reporter's choice between doing what he believes is right, and keeping his job and status as an anchor. The story is well written, and once you get a chapter or two into the book, it is hard to put down. I gave this book three stars in comparison to his other works, but it is an excellent read and well worth the time and effort to do so."
5,I just couldn't put it down!,"At first it may seem dragging because of all the news terms, but you grow to love it. There are times when I didn't want to turn the page in fear of knowing what would happen to John and Leslie's investigation and if it gets foiled and whatnot. But I just had to finish the story.The book taught me a lot of things: about abortion, about newscasting, about the law and most especially, about how God speaks to His people. And the very description of the lamb is so breathtaking, I also want to see it!It's an amazingly good read, one that will keep you on the edge of your seats and learn a lot from too. (This should be made into a movie!)"
3,"Interesting, but too long and predictable","This book was quite good, though I don't think it is in the same league as ""This Present Darkness"". It did not deliver the sometimes spine-tingling vivid descriptions that I enjoy in a thriller. The first few chapters had me hooked, and the end was o.k., but rather predictable, and the middle was just too long and drawn out."
3,Very well written,"Although I enjoyed reading this book,I feel that the auther made it too charismatic by implying that John inherited his father's gift of prophecy kind of like Elisha (in the Bible)inheriting a double portion of Elijah's spirit.I dislike the fact that this was the main focus of the book.It should have just revealed the evils of the time and not gone into modern-day prophet stuff of which alot of is not truly biblical and the supposed 'prophets' do alot of unscriptual things. Otherwise,this book is a great revealer of what our political situation is like these days."
3,Yey! for Frank Peretti!,"Although the book is a good read, I feel that more importance was given to the abortion malpractice cover-up and not the fact that babies are getting murdered. Also it was too ""wordy"" for my taste. But Mr Peretti, I commend you for writing your books so well and all for the glory of God. May you churn out more Christian novels! You have the gift. I am so glad you are using it for God's glory."
1,I couldn't even finish it.,"Normally I enjoy Peretti's work. I read ""This Present Darkness"" and ""The Oath"" and enjoyed each of them for the most part. ""Prophet"" was given to me as a Christmas gift and I began reading it on a flight to San Diego. I got about two thirds of the way through and didn't finish it. I really tried to get into the book and into the characters. Unfortunately, I really didn't care for any of them. I put the book down and don't really care how it ends. Mr. Peretti, it's nothing personal. You are one of my favorite authors, and I will certainly continue to support your work. This book, however, leaves much to be desired."
3,"Not ""very good condition""","The listing for this book said it was in very good condition and I bought from this seller based on that listing. When it arrived, it is very yellowed and the edges are dirty. I would never have bought this book if I had looked at it beforehand. I am only keeping it because it would cost more to send it back than I paid for it. The seller should be honest in the assessment of the condition of the book."
1,It's an agenda!,"I had such high hopes for this novel. I loved ""This Present Darkness"" and ""Piercing the Darkness"". They had thrilling plots and great messages about the power of prayer and God's grace. But what a disappointment this was. I only made it about half way through before putting it down.I was turned off immediately from the subtle but definitely present right-wing conservative agenda. I tried to put that aside and just concentrate on the story, but the slow pace and dull characters made that difficult. At one point Peretti actually writes that an abortion clinic would falsely tell a woman she was pregnant just to get her money for an abortion. The real miracle is that Peretti can still write with his head that far up his butt.If you believe in the right-wing views of the media, homosexuality and abortion then you will like this book, because that's what this book is really all about."
3,Cannot remember,How can I remove this item from things to be reviewed? I purchased this years ago. I have to keep recharging it as it no longer holds its charge very long even when I haven't used the 16-year old camera for which it was purchased.
5,"Spin it, my friend!","What can I say? Tale Spin is simply the greatest, most entertaining television cartoon Disney ever made. It actually has some brains to it along with great characters (especially Kit Cloudkicker), non-stop action and adventure, and includes some heart and laughter. I highly recommend this great show to anyone who loves high flying adventure"
1,Not worth the time and effort,"As a follow up to The Forever King, this book is pointless. I felt as though the authors only wrote it because of their ealier success, not because they had a story to tell. The emphasis was not on Arthur or Artherian legend, this book details the life and rituals of Saladin, Arthur's evil rival for world domination."
3,"Not as good as the First, but worth a read","I came across this book by accident, and remembering the wonderful story and characters of ""The Forever King"", I anticipated a wonderful read.Well, I couldn't put it down, and enjoyed it, but there was something lacking. The character and background of Taliesin (Merlin) was emphasized, as were the Druidic/Ancient Gods, and the story of Arthur, but the modern storyline was, er, not neglected but given less emphasis than deserved, and the characters of the modern storyline were also left rather undeveloped.The first book left the story of Arthur and his protector's future to the imagination of the reader. I must confess that I didn't imagine all this... It's a good read, but like many sequels, it lacked the soul of the original.So, I suggest that fans of the original story read it, but diminish your expectations just a bit."
4,AN OKAY BOOK,"Although I liked The Forever King better, I thought this was a good book. I liked the end a lot, but I think the authors should do a third book. The end practically leaves you hanging."
1,Very dissappointing sequel.,"This book should not have been written to begin with. The Forever King (the prequel) ended appropriately, and did not need a follow-up. Somehow, the originality of the previous book has lost its luster the second time around. Many of the prolonged passages between Merlin and ""the Innocent"" are drawn out too long. There is too much emphasis placed on the evilness of the villan. This is mostly done through the graphic depiction of gory, sexual satanic rituals which were not necessary to the story. When I first read the summary of the book, I thought ""Reading about the Knights in modern N.Y. City will be cool,"" however, there was very little of this. I must strongly urge anyone who read and enjoyed The Forever King to avoid The Broken Sword at all cost."
5,I hope there are plans for another book,"I hope there are plans for another book. I know it would be hard to find another storyline for the characters to follow up on. But I think that the characters themselves are so 'alive' that any sequel to this book would sell itself on the sheer basis that it's a sequel to ""The Broken Sword""."
5,every bit as exciting as a sequel should be.,"aurthur is now thirteen years old.hal has been with him searching for emily all this time,when finnaly they meet.there reunion is short lived.salidin has passed the torch to someone else a man nammed aubry who will stop at nothing to have posession of the grail.also all the knights of the round table have been brought back to life but are having a rough time adapting to life in the twentieth century,driving hal crazy in the process. this sequel has 5 stars written all over it.a must read if you enjoyed the forever king... there also is a new character named zack,i must say HE`S THE MAN!!!!"
4,For the LP fans and non-LP fans...,"LP fans! Of course, if you want to hear a live track of Lying from You and you want to increase your collection of LP goodies, then grab this single.For everyone else, grab this single if you want to hear a taster of Linkin Park's ""Meteora"" album, and a live performance of ""Lying from You"" (which is also on the ""Meteora"" album).If you like it, go grab yourself the ""Hybrid Theory"", ""Live in Texas [CD/DVD]"" and the ""Meteora"" albums."
5,The Mother of ALL MTB Tires!!!!,"Mud, rain, sand, rock, shattered rock, loose gravel...concrete...it doesn't matter!!!! These kickass tires are the pitbull of tires...uphill, downhill, flat...extreme downhill...nothing can stop them...great product that I will buy again!"
5,Awesome Tires. You have my recomendation,"Great all around tire. Good for MX, cross country, and the more intense stuff. Not to mention they look great too! A+ in my book!"
3,The Truth Hurts,"Here is a book that deals with the psychological aspect of chess playing. I did not like some of the inferrences, but then, neither would I like some of the analyses given up by a psychoanalyst. If you would like to know the driving force behind yourself, perhaps your husband's or girlfriend's game of chess, then you will like this book."
5,love this book,"I love this book! Bought it used with a bunch of other psychology books, didn't think much of it, but it turned out to be not only very useful, but very enjoyable to read. Minuchin is one of my very favorite therapists to watch and to read about, this book is like having him sit with you and explain his theories in detail. It is filled with case examples and transcripts of actual sessions. Not sure the book is going to turn me into a ""master"" like him, but it makes me feel like I have a few more very helpful tools in my family therapy toolbox! Highly recommended!"
4,Hair raising,"This is the most hair raising of the Case Closed movies i have seen yet. Mystery stories that keep you on the edge of your seat and make your hair prickle from expectation are the best. Very well done climax. And a great all around mystery. Great art work too. So it gets 4 stars.The only bummer is that i do not know Japanese well enough to figure out some of the clues, but i will still keep collecting these movies.Case Closed, Countdown to Heaven is recommended to all who love mysteries."
5,Case closed movie 5,This movie was great if you are a case closed fan you have to add this movie to your collection it's a must see
5,absolutely gorgeous,"Bob Marley is not only one of the most influential singer/songwriters ever, but he is incredibly photogenic. His songs are as beautiful as he is. Morris' book gives great insight into the man he was, not only through the main component of the book, the photographs, but also the commentary. The pictures are incredibly expressive, showing all of Bob's emotions. Morris' comments are perfectly placed and very well written. Action shots, stills, live shots of concerts...Morris has it all. Though my musical tastes have changed over time, and I expect they will even more as I grow older, Bob Marley will always be, by far, my favorite."
5,camo for everyone,My Godson wanted a camo shirt - his school colors are orange and black. Amazon had all kinds of colors to choose from. He was ecstatic with his gift!!
2,Pic is deceiving,This pic is very deceiving. The whole package is incredibly small as are its contents. I would not recommend at all.
3,A nice items for sauna elves,Small items but it works as a stocking stuffer for my Finnish sauna pals. I'm sure it will be talk of next summers saunas.
1,"Great Idea, Terrible Follow-Through","This sounds like a great idea, but the design is very poor.The handle on the one I got came away from the base in less than ten minutes use. To see just how bad this design is, look at the place where the handle attaches to the base. This is a place that has to move and takes a lot of the strain. On this one, it is only as wide as the handle. On other wind up flashlights, they are two or three times the width of the handle! Why so wide? Well, all your cranking won't be perfect, sometimes you'll move to one side or another - you just can't help it - so it is needs to be strong. The handle pulled out the base because there were only three very tiny prongs - about the thickness of a writing pen tip or smaller - and only two were metal."
4,Glad I bought it,"After reading the reviewer whose crank came off, I almost didn't buy this, but I went ahead because I trusted the manufacturer Highgear. It will meet my need to have a hand cranked radio and cell phone charger. The handle seems strong enough for most users, expecially if they crank at a moderate rate. Ten minutes of cranking is a long time. I cranked it as I was watching the news. During a period of power outage there probably will be plenty of time to crank. I wouldn't let a five year old crank it, but most people shouldn't have a problem with breaking the handle.After cranking, the light and the radio worked fine. I like the compact size and light weight."
2,Cell phone accessories may not fit your phone!,"I purchased this for all of it's features, but especially for the cell phone charger. Although my wife and I own very popular models of an LG brand phone, and there is an LG adapter included in the kit, they are not close to being compatible. I assumed that you could just plug a car charger into this or something, and that isn't the case either.I haven't tried out the other features yet, and they may or may not work well, but as for the phone adapters, I'm a little disappointed."
2,Find Another Emergency Radio!!!,"Everything on this unit worked well with the exception of the AM radio. The emergency alarm could be heard on every frequency of the AM radio - changing frequency just changed the volume of the alarm. One of the great features of AM is that it can be heard over long distances compared to FM. If you are in a remote area where FM is hit or miss, AM would be available. The flaw in this item negates that. The case isn't quite as sturdy as I would like but it should hold up,"
4,a good product,Did not use much..but tested all the features and all worked well as descibed in the product description... I also charged my nokia phine with its adapters
3,ugh,Makes a horrible squeak when I wind it. I should send it back. The cell phone attachments are small and are easily lost. I couldn't imagine trying to find them in the dark or during an emergency. The light is not very bright but I guess it'll do. I'm really considering sending this back b/c of the squeaking. The fm radio and alarm along with the light seem like this would be a useful all in one in case of emergency.
3,Will work okay but...,"Don't expect everything to work at once. I got this for emergency preparedness, and you cannot use the radio and the flashlight at the same time because of the static. One might imagine that both could be needed while walking around. The alarm is pretty good - all my pets scurried out of the room when I activated it, but my neighbors didn't come running, so I don't think it is quite loud enough. You are supposed to be able to crank it to recharge it, which is why I bought it, but I don't know if I am supposed to use rechargeable batteries or not. I will replace it with a higher caliber one than this item. In the meantime, this will be useful enough."
4,Great to have,"I got this in case of emergencies. I charged it when I first got it, and it works well. Comes with several cell phone adapters. The directions for first use are on the packaging."
5,best live beefheart,"great band. great show. this is an excellent recording of the magic band. fowler's trombone steals many moments during this show, but the entire band is playing really well. i got this one down at my local record shop for about forty bucks, but it's a limited edition, non-bootleg live Beefheart (though i have seen a bootleg of the same show. if you can find it cheaper, i would get it because it's some of the best playing of anybody circa 1978."
1,shoddy workmanship,"When the chairs arrived they were fine. Within a week the black paint started to peel away. In about 6 weeks, each chair is damaged. I would NOT recommend this product."
3,Good Popcorn!,"Okay, so I know what you are thinking. If it is good popcorn, why the 3 stars? Because, this is not the Chicago Style popcorn I've come to know and love. Chicago style is a blend of cheese and caramel flavors. The popcorn that I've had before married these flavors into one blend so that each kernal had a coating of both flavors mixed together. This popcorn was a bag of cheese popcorn mixed with caramel popcorn. Two different popcorns mixed together in one bag instead of one kind of popcorn with a blended flavor base.Having said that, this popcorn was good for what it was and fresh too!! Just the freshness was a treat as so many canned/bagged popcorn one could buy is stale. So, on that front I was satisfied. I just wish I could find the same popcorn I love again. The guy who sold it here moved shop and I can't find him! So, thanks Cornzapoppin for giving this a whirl, but I gotta keep looking!"
1,Not All-Compatible,This item which was a recommended accessory for the Sharp Viewcam I also purchased from Amazon.Com apparently was not compatible.
1,Never Received This product.,"I ordered Red Buffalo Cherry Chocolate Coffee in the hopes that it would taste like the Cherry Chocolate Coffee that Einstein's used to sell in January and February. Alas, within a few days of ordering this coffee I was notified that it was no longer available."
5,Cherry chocolate coffee,"Rating this coffee because I want people to know this is some good tasting coffee, I looked for chocolate and I found this one. Decided to try and I 'm glad I did. Excellent with dessert."
1,Smoke and Mirrors,"Don't waste your money on this book- states the obvious inan over-inflated language that serves to make the authors appear deeper than they really are. If they actually took the time to look around at the world and stop looking at design magazines they would realize that this topic is a more complex one globally rooted in the vernacular of farms, military architecture and the way people have lived and worked. Again shows the insecurity of landscape architects who feel they have to fabricate theory (and demonstrate their ignorance of the subject) in order to be taken seriously rather than address the realities of their own field."
1,Garmin Maps Outdated,"Bought this product (Garmin Setup / Map Dvd Mobile Xt & Nroute North America - Parts - Mfr Part #010-10841-00) from Amazon merchant Gizmosforlife.com, and discovered that the North American Map data was way out of date - actually two versions behind Garmin's current map. The merchant graciously agreed to accept a return and give a refund; I returned the product and it was delivered on June 16, but I have yet to see the refund.This purchase was not worth the trouble it caused, even assuming I get the refund. Better to pay full price at Garmin on-line."
4,"ONE TWO...PHAT BEATS, TIGHT LYRICS, MUSICAL STEW","High Expectations: MetSecular quality: AffirmativePick this album up!The Ambassador drops lyrics that explode into your cranium, he's nuclear...blowin up spiritual factions like mark mcgwuire sends the ball out tha stadium(pretty good, huh?) :)Songs such as ""One Two"", ""Hold Your Ground"", ""Hands In the Air"", ""Girl Named World"", ""It Was Love"", ""WhirlWind"" could all be put out as singles. This guy is a lyrical genius and musical specialist. Although some rhymes sound a bit redundant throughout the album, they're very easy to overlook. I can honestly say not a dull beat or ill rhyme resides on this disk. Well, except for his attempt at a slow song in ""I Love You Jesus"". (still love ya man) But in my opinion, that's the only negative exception. Even the interludes are enjoyable.Don't Hesitate! Buy NOW!"
5,wow.,"I didn't think Will's solo release would be all that without his CM buddies featured in every track, but I have to admit, he pulled this CD off with flying colours. I was head bobbin' + foot bangin' from track 1 to 21."
5,Simply Wonderful,"This is a wonderful cd. Ambassador is the best rapper out, christian rap or wordly rap. He has hard beats and lyrics with strickly the word of God. God has really given this young man a gift. He has truely inspired me with this cd and all of his other ones.may God continue to bless the crossmovement1 luvTerrance Green"
5,somethin' to bump,"This is one tight CD everybody's gotta have. I've been looking for a long time for a great christian rap album, and finally I found one. Every song has a sick beat and great lyrics that have a deep message. This CD is a great inspiration for all christian rap lovers."
5,BLAZING HOT CLASSIC!!!! Cd's like this are rare.,"This cd is head and shoulders above the rest. The deep lryical content and talent presented by The Ambassador are surpassed by none.He is a true lyrical genius.This cd has so much substance that I listened to it about 4 times no-stop and I did not skip one song.Each time I listened to the cd I picked up on something new. The Ambassador thoroughly delivers the gospel on each track through tight metaphors, similes, beats and hooks.The message is easier to digest and it lingers within, when it's presented in this format. Young believers, like myself, really need cd's like this, Christology is a must have for any music collection.I give it 10 stars.Keep an eye on The Cross Movement."
4,Definitely Advanced!,"Although I describe myself as an advanced workout kind of person, I had a lot of trouble with this one. And I even got sore the next days, which hasn't happened in a long time! The only bad thing about this dvd is that it concentrates mostly on the arms which wasn't in the description of this workout. I would have liked a bit more of thighs and abs, so that is the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.I never watched an Kathy Ireland workout before, but I will definitely buy another one."
1,Really Disappointing,"As a fan of kathy's first video -- total fitness workout -- i was really looking forward to this one. I hate to say this but it really stinks -- working out has to be fun, concise, get the job done etc. etc... this isn't fun and it's way too long and just plain boring. I turned it off after the first 15 minutes -- don't bother buying this one, it's terrible!! It's not an exercise routine that you would enjoy doing over and over -- what happened????"
1,Awful!!,"This is a tough advanced level workout. That is the ONLY good thing I can say about it.First, I think it is too hard for Kathy. At certain points, she can barely speak, she's so tired. Other times, her form is terrible because she's tired.Second, it is terribly boring. The weight circuits alternate with cardio circuits, but you are doing the SAME cardio circuit each time. yaaaawwwwnnnnn!Third, the weight training circuits have you doing two sets of 20 reps per exercise. I'd rather have three sets of fewer reps or maybe to some different types of exercises for that particular muscle (i.e. 20 bicep curls and 20 hammer curls).Fourth, no ab work to speak of.Fifth, Kathy's ""banter"" with the other exercisers is annoying.Lastly, you will want to reach into the TV and smack Andre (one fo the back-up exercisers) after about 10 minutes. He's just that irritating and distracting."
3,"Good work out, DVD faulty",The DVD seems great but it stalls in the warm up section each time... the exercises seem to be very good!
1,as a sex therapist I would not recommend,"As a sex and marriage therapist with a graduate degree and about to complete my doctorate, this book may strike a chord with some people but I believe is overall dangerous to many. I would definitely not recommend this book to any of my clients. It is contradictory, overgeneralizing, obvious, full of cliche, and she adds nothing to the books that are already out there from more notable, educated, and experienced clinicians even though she tried to coin her own terms that are not well thought through. She quotes Gray, and Dobson repeatedly. You might as well just read their books. A member of the church would get more out of those books that also overgeneralize and mislead.The worst thing about this book is that she could have said everything in less than 50 pages but is not skilled in being parsimonious. The repetition of the same stuff over and over again got tiring"
4,Frustrated,"Amazon is only the preferred place to purchase books because of lower priced used books. The purchase experience has been very frustrating for me on more than one occasion. THe most recent time, in trying to change my address, the billing credit card address was changed but not the delivery address. I waited a few extra days for the delivery. Fortunate the Post Office forwarded the order.A previous time I ordered two book but several books came up when it came time to purchase. I had stopped and closed Amazon down previously to be able to ""change"" the order. Frustrated when back into Amazon, I paid for the additional books, gave the extra away.You have my money but I am avoiding buying new booksUnhappy and Frustrated with cheap booksCarlos Watkins"
5,Great book especially for newlyweds!,"I found this really helpful when I was first married. I even took it on the honeymoon. I am glad I did because it helped me to better understand what we could do to make sex more enjoyable, especially for me as a woman."
2,Disappointed in Amazon's description...,"I just began this book and I'm sure I'm premature in writing a review but I feel I must get the truth about this book out immediately. This books is written strongly from a Church of the Latter-day Saints (LDS) slant. Many of the quotations come from LDS ""prophets"" which is more than troubling to me as a Christian woman. I'm trying to overlook this and gleen some help from book but it's difficult. How can Amazon write a description and not mention this book has a strong religious slant? Ugh! I wasn't interested in getting indoctinated by another faith -- just improving my relationship with my husband. BE CAREFUL."
4,And They Were Not Ashamed,"Great gift for my daughter and her fiance before they got married. Nice review of the importance of sexual intimacy in marriage and even somewhat enlightening for me after 26 years of marriage. A little repetitive, but the author makes her point well: women are supposed to enjoy sex!"
5,"An excellent, well-founded book","Failed marriages are epidemic, and difficulties with the sexual dimension of marriage is the common denominator in all failed marriages. This book dispels myths, identifies pitfalls, and gives hope in a very positive way. I will give it as a wedding gift to my daughters in the hope that they will have successful marriages."
4,"Helpful info for a ""good"" girl","A tasteful, gospel-centered approach to dealing with sexual intimacy and over-coming pre-conceived ideas from growing up as a good girl."
5,A GREAT !!! LDS Book on Marital Intimacy,"Finally!!!! an LDS book on marital intimacy that is actually very clear on such a sacred and crucially important part of marriage and family. The author has done a tremendous service for all who will have the privilage to learn and benefit from her work. I look forward to applying the information in my own marriage, and teaching our children. I have read several LDS Books on the same topic, and this by far is the best."
5,best hand cream ever,"Hands down this is the best hand cream ever. I have been using it for 2 years now after a recommendation from my doctor. It's so smoothing, but not at all greasy. .and i love the clean smell. ."
5,never regret,A friend of mine recommended this product a couple of months ago.Always I'm using HERBACIN after I wash my hands and before i go to bed.It's really effective and helpful for extremely dry hands. also it's grate item ever I had.I'm going to plan using it continuingly.Don't hesitate to buy it if you're considering!
5,Excellent,This wonderful German hand cream seems to be healing my dry skin cracks on my hands! I truly love it!
4,"funny smell, but it works","I've been searching for a specific lotion from Germany and found this one. The smell is somewhat pungent, but it works for longer period of time than most lotions."
2,Not good,It is not worth the price. The quality is not good. I don't like it.....I have no idea why it cost so much
1,James Coburn Collection,"If the vendor would have included in the write up of this DVD that it is only trailers of James Coburn movies instead of a collection of James Coburn movies, I would never have bought it. Please post this so others will know that this is a rip off, no movies at all just short movie trailers, I am surprised that Amazon let this slide by. Sincerely... A very disappointed customer...R.L. Stephenson"
5,nice plates,The plates are really nice for everyday use. My family has always trusted Corelle because of its quality and durability. They also delivered them pretty quickly.
5,Better than expected!!!,A very nice set of dinnerware. The price was unbelievable (about 1/2 the price of the outlet mall store) and is perfect for every day use. I would recommend this item.
5,dropped......,"My husband dropped a plate the other day and was AMAZED that it didn't shatter, or crack or even chip....I love corelle! My mom was right this stuff is great, also this patter is really nice, my husband begged me not to get anything girlie, but he was okay with this pattern"
3,Pattern missing on one item,"Overall the set is great, however, one of the bread 'n butter plates had the pattern on just one half of the dish. I'm sure it's just one of those things that slipped past quality control."
3,Everything except the glasses were perfect,"I purchased 5 sets of these dishes and we use them at church and they get the crap beat out of them and they've performed beautifully. One of the main things I like is how light they are and how compact they stack. We can get the entire set (40 place settings) on one shelf in one cabinet. The only reason I took away 2 stars is the glasses are WAY too easy to break. I broke the first one in the initial wash(hand wash)and immediately donated them to another charity. I purchased some nice service glasses at Sam's Club and with these dishes, it makes a perfect way to go Green at church. Also, with their nice stacking, you can fit about 25 sets into the dishwasher at once."
5,exactly what i was looking for,"The dishes were very pretty and the glasses are nice. We ordered 2 sets, originally. Later, we bought another 4 plates."
5,Very pleased with purchase,"I purchased 3 sets of the dishes for everyday use and I am very pleased with them. All three sets arrived intact, nothing broken or cracked including the drinking glasses. The smaller plates are smaller than I expected, more like a saucer size. We've taken them from fridge to microwave to dishwasher with no problems! They are much lighter than our older stoneware everyday dishes too."
3,Love it but disappointed,"My wife loves the pattern and loved the fact that she could chose glasses instead of coffee cups but when they came, we were disppointed that all the plates are warped. These are not cheap plates and when you stack them you can see how warped they are."
1,GLASSES ARE NOT UNBREAKABLE,"I am really disappointed with this purchase. The glasses are made of cheap glass and BREAK easily. I bought two sets in Jan 07 and since then 6 glasses have broken. I called Corelle to inquire about the warranty, but they said the glasses are not covered under the warranty, ONLY the bowls and plates. I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED...."
4,"Don't be fooled by the ""Vol. 2""","Don't be fooled by the title of this record, this IS NOT a second volume of the great Tepid Peppermint Wonderland compilation, rather it is the vinyl release of that same album.Just thought I'd throw that little PSA out there in case someone makes the mistake of ordering the same music twice while thinking they're getting more."
3,"Works OK but 3 speeds are fast, faster, fastest","This motor works as advertised, but it's slowest speed is about the same speed as the fastest speed on the motor it is replacing. The difference in the 3 speeds is perceptible but miniscule."
1,for a collection,If you like sudoku and rubix cubes and collect things related to one or both go ahead and buy this. It is a poorly made cube regardless of the stickers.
3,Good not Great,"I bought this for my dad who love sudoku puzzles. It was way challenging. Not the best quality, and kind of a onetime thing. I would probably go with a sudoku book instead."
3,worthy only if..,"hello, i have bought this sudoku like 6 months back. up to now i have used it only for two times. ofcourse its durable, but i don have a time to spend with it. so i got that, only people who have no work, who dont have small kids to take care and people who travels alone for a long distance can enjoy it. and its really very tough puzzle that small kids cannot solve."
2,Not a very good gift,"I got this for my little brother's birthday and he seemed to enjoy it at first, however, he later became obsessed with solving the cube. He grew increasingly more distant and eventually stopped talking to friends and family. It got to the point where he was down to 75 pounds because he refused to eat; While he was furiously twisting the diabloical block, it broke apart, sending numbered shrapnel across the room killing both our parents. Oblivious to our parents life-less bodies, he locked himself in his room, determined to repair the cube and complete it's unholy puzzle. I could only hear animal-like howls and shrieks through the door. I haven't seen my brother in twelve years. I'm selling our house; I'll probably just brick up the doorway and plaster over it.This item is dangerous and should be banned from sale in the US."
1,Poorly Made Rubik's Cube,"I bought this Sudoku style Rubik's Cube for $9.99 which included shipping. I figure this thing shouldn't have cost more than $2.99 as it is so POORLY MADE. Two of the number decals that are glued to the otherwise black cube were peeling off before I even opened the package! The Sudoku Cube has a light and chintzy feeling to it. There is a lot of friction when rotating the pieces, such that the other cheap number stickers get caught on the opposing pieces and start to tear off as you play. This product really gives ""made in China"" a bad name. I'd pay $20 for a Rubik's cube that rotated without effort and was built to last. This purchase was a waste of $10. I'd donate it to the Goodwill, but it's a choking hazard; so it's to the dumpster instead!"
1,Lower grade quality,pieces are very fragile and pop-out while turning. Very hard to rotate. So difficult to rotate that you loose the interest in the play.
4,Fun Cube,"This is one of the cheaper cubes. You have to be careful when you turn or you can break it. I have a few of these cheaper style cubes, and I've broken one already. I've made sure to be careful with this one. Lubricate this cube and you'll be OK. It's definitely a new twist on the Rubik's cube. Pay attention to the orientation before you scramble. It's tricky to re-assemble. I found this to be harder than a regular Rubik's cube."
3,un poco duro,un poco duro para maniobrar.es buen adorno para colocarlo junto a otros cubos.tengo varios cubos que son muy buenos este es uno de los que mas deficil de ver al armar es lo cual lo convierte en buen reto para pasar el tiempo.
1,Crappy Cube,I wanted the the numbers in order on each face 1 through 9. Instead I got this jumbled mess. The cube turns like a rusted bolt and breaks at the thought of dismantling and lubricating. It stinks.
2,broke quickly,"This is a great idea, but it fell apart after only 2-3 days of play! Immediately apparent was a single center number was elevated slightly above the rest. I suppose this must have caused whe whole thing to be unstable. Poor engineering or just cheap construction?"
1,"Another Dollar Store Item, worth less than a dollar...","The industry needs to realize that making a toy as inexpensive as possible is not the way to make money. Sure, this thing is only selling for five bucks, but I would gladly pay fifteen for something that actually WORKED! I was so excited when this item came in because it looked like so much fun. You cant even turn this thing once without the individual cubes wanting to snap out. After every turn, you have to put the pieces back into place."
1,Labels fell off when I first touched it.,"Not sure if it was stored in a bad location, or more likely, they used really bad glue, but either way, the very first time I tried to rotate it after opening the package, 3 of the stickers immediately fell off.Threw it in the trash after never trying it unfortunately."
1,soduku,"I bought this soduku puzzle cube for my husband as a gift because he loves soduku and he loves rubiks cube and it was a cute idea to find one that was both, at first he loved it but later it broke too easily when trying to play it. I was not happy with this item. It was a waste of money and time."
1,SOB broke when I touched it!,"I hate to bring bad news (I usually only write good stuff), but this product is SO BAD that I have to give you a warning.I bought this at the same time I bought my Rubik's Cube (about a month ago). I've used the Rubik's Cube so many times myforearms hurt, but I've only used this 'toy' once. Not even once actually. In fact, the first time I moved the top layerit broke a corner piece and it went flying.The FIRST twist!!! Are you kidding me!?!?I honestly cannot rate this toy for its educational or fun value cuz I haven't used it (it's broke). What I can say is:""This toy sucks and I would not buy it!""If they make it durable...maybe I'd try it again. After all, I love puzzles. But it isn't durable and was a waste of money.Weston Lyon"
1,Poor quality cube,"Sorry to say this, but this cube is very stiff and hardly to move. Feels light and cheap. Not to be recommended. Might be a better solution to buy a standard cube and apply SUDOKU stickers which are available in several internet shops."
3,Hick Country with a TWIST!,"This CD shows what promise this young band has. The songs are lively, fun, and very relevant to our time period! I have seen this band play numerous times in Key WEst, and am impressed by the crowd they draw. Listeners enjoyed the live version so much they HAD to buy the CD! I can remember within a week the guys were sold out of the CDS and had to have an emergancy shipment delievered! A definite must buy! Watch out for these guys, they are incredible! (FYI also are the voices of the latest Coca cola radio) commercial)"
5,Great Country Rock,"Heard them at the Hogsbreath in Destin Florida. Couldn't believe what I was hearing. This is Great stuff. I was raised on Country Rock, and this ranks high with me. I recommend this one and can't wait to here the new CD."
5,Moody Blues Collected CD review,My husband and I enjoy listening to the Moody Blues. This CD is great. The compilation of the Moody Blues' music in this 3-CD is wonderful. We are enjoying it very much.
4,Mambo & House.,"This is the first CD of a series belonging to the company Nopalbeat Records. I liked it a lot. It mixes elements from the great mambo master, Mr Pérez Prado, with fine house music. It's very good electronica from Mexico. They also experiment with other rythms, such as cumbia, but I liked the mambo/house mix better. Congratulations to all those involved in the project. I'm collecting the whole series. So far, it's 8 CD's."
1,Didn't work upon arrival,"This watch is a sharp-looking timepiece but it didn't work right out of the box. I took it to a jeweler but as its Swiss-made, it would have to be shipped out to have it examined AND even if it was *just* the battery, it would have to be shipped out each time for a battery replacement because typical jewelry stores have a problem with the pressurized backing on these types of watches. Shouldn't the watch work upon arrival? Go figure.The watch was a bit larger than I thought it would be but it still looked really nice.I called the vender and they took it back. They SHOULD have checked it before they sent it me; I spent $11 just to have a watch sent to me that didn't work. They wouldn't refund me the initial shipping cost -.-MOST unhappy about this."
4,Another Wick winner.,"Kent Maynard, Sunk Like God Behind the House (Kent State, 2001)Another entry in the Wick Chapbook series, which is rapidly proving itself to have achieved what may be the highest average quality over a series in the past half-decade. Maynard's book chronicles moments from a stay in rural Cameroon, and the poems have the feel of having been written in that short span of time between being a tourist, when everything's worth noting, and being inured, when nothing's worth noting. The end result is a selection of fine observations that both delineate the differences between the lives of the subjects and the life of the reader and stresses the commonality of the human condition, as all good ""outsider"" poetry should do. Maynard does get a tad heavy-handed with the symbolism on occasion, but this isn't a book whose politics are going to stand up and slap you in the face.As with all the Wick Chapbooks I've read and reviewed so far, this one comes with an unhesitating recommendation. ***"
2,Not worth the money.,"""Quick-release ratchet is a better design than other tie-down brands I've used, but strap is thin & breaks easily, plus all ratchet covers (made of rubber) have slipped off after just a few uses. So product is overpriced & of only fair quality. Would not recommend purchasing it."""
5,Great Tie Downs,"We have a lot of ATV and motorcycles. We have used and went through many, many different Tie Downs. These are great! They was a great price and very durable! Would totally recommend them!"
2,Description is deceptive,"I received these today. The product label on each of the straps clearly states that the working load limit is 666 lbs, not the 1500 lb working load limit listed in the product description. They are probably still suitable as tie-downs for a relatively light motorcycle, but are not as advertised.Follow up: I've now been using these ratchets for a little over a year. They are starting to fray and rip. The material is relatively strong, but very very thin, and seems to be more prone to tearing compared to other ratchet brands."
2,low end stuff,"These tie down ratchets are OK for very occasional use, but not more than that. Light weight straps wear or tear quickly, and mechanism is cheap."
4,"Nice ratchets, Quality could be better.",So far they have gotten the job done. However i feel the quality could be better especially with the rubber molding on the part you press on to break the ratchet.
3,"Straps seem okay, too much packaging.",4 green 6' ratchet straps. Can't complain.The packaging was really excessive. 4 lbs of plastic that I'm just gonna throw away (not recyclable.) Ugh...
1,Junk,Already falling apart. The strap is so long that you can only take in half the strap so you need to find ways to use the strap so it can be tightened. The rachets feel cheap. I say go with something else.
5,Gets the Job Done,"I bought this just over a year ago to fit onto my Toto bidet. It was the least expensive fixture option I could find that had the vacuum breaker. The short end of it is this: so far, so good. I've had no trouble with the fixtures and they do everything I would expect of them. Not to mention, they have a nice chrome finish, so they look pretty nice as well.Recommended buy."
5,The Gracefulness of Animal Relations,"Mary Lou Randour, Ph.D, and her book advocating the healing relationship of animals, in the engaged Buddhist vein, is a hopeful book for the betterment of people and for animals. Mary Lou, director of programs, for PsyETA (The Psychologists for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) is as connected to the animal kingdom as Brother Wayne Teasdale is to the spiritual. For animal lovers, this is a book that has long been dreamed, and will be an excellent read for cross referencing with the literature on animals, ecology, nature writing, and political advocacy groups. This is a must read for those who want to contribute with passion and compassion. I highly recommend Animal Grace."
4,Good book,"I enjoyed this book. I like the exploration of practical spirituality and this book discusses the role of animals in this exploration and learning. I love the chapter ""What animals can teach us about spirituality"" - very good. One of my favorite thoughts in this whole book is ""When we get down to the essence of spirituality, however, it is simply about love."" What a wonderful concept. And if you like this idea, buy this book. You can also find concepts like this on a web site I just found, spirituality.com.Enjoy !"
5,Very readable!,"Mary Lou Randour, a professional psychologist, ties together spiritual insights from various faith traditions and animal advocacy in this very readable book."
1,Vegetarianism,"I was disappointed in this book, having read the reviews.It is a treatise in support of vegetarianism, anti vivisection, and animal liberation. It should be advertised as such. I was looking for more than a lecture on the spritual values of non meat eating, and animal liberation, as valuable as they are. Some occasional beautiful tiny glimpses into animal behaviour were moving, indeed, but hardly enough to warrant purchase of the volume. I think it was highly overrated by all."
1,Defective,"The product was missing parts and the parts that were there a couple were broken/defective. And when I opened the box, it looked like it had been returned once before...probably for same reason. At least Amazon is taking care of the issue and I am sending it back for a full refund."
4,Log Holder,I gave this as a Christmas gift to our daughter. She liked it very much. I chose it as she could fold it up and store it during the months she doesn't use her fireplace.
5,Peaceful & worshipful evening of Christmas,"Excellent - one if not the best of Christmas CD's. Steve is very talented and an excellent performer. The ""FEAST"" CD shows great interpretation of Christmas hymns and traditional songs. Turn the lights down low, relax for 50 min, and you will not regret listening to Steve play. A must own Christmas CD."
2,How?,"How can I review this when it is a service that I haven't had to use yet? I think it would be good to be able to start this when the original warranty is up. Also, why do I have to keep a receipt on this? I feel that should be included in the warranty paperwork. If I use the service I will rerate."
2,"Beautiful Music, But a Disappointing Restoration","Rhino, in the liner notes for this CD, refers to the Gay Purr-ee soundtrack as having been restored from the original Warner master tapes.What exactly has been restored is open to debate, as the entire album is marred with audible tape hiss and occasional dropouts. If any restoration of these elements took place, it isn't audible in the finished product.It's still a ""must have"" for anyone who loves Judy Garland...but with the tiniest bit of effort, this long overdue CD could have been worlds better. As things stand, it's mediocre at best."
5,Only Garland Voice-Over Cartoon Soundtrack,"A wonderful soundtrack to have with Judy Garland and Robert Goulet amongst others providing the voices for the characters in this Parisian fantasy...Judy is in fine voice in one of her later efforts (1962); actually right before her ill-fated TV series, which is also available in two volumes on DVD....the best ones being put out by Pioneer..Robert Goulet and Judy shine in the song ""Bubbles"" also fine Judy solos in Paris is Lonely Town, Little drops of Rain, etc..I actually picked up the LP of this somewhere, years ago, and have transferred the recording to CD and then imported the CD to my I-Tune collection, and will probably transfer it to my I-Pod at some future date. The music is penned by Yarburg, the composer of the music of the Wizard of Oz, so it was kind of a reunion for Judy with this famous writer of songs for the Wizard. Would highly recommend this CD to anyone interested in the various recordings of Judy over the years.."
2,Not what it seems,"This DVD has no movies on it, it is basically a listing of his top movies. The DVD plays the original movie reel intro's from the adverts in the cinema pre release of the film."
3,Titles required,"Can not review or order as the Titles of the films are not mentioned. This is a recurring faux pas/omission on your website Even in case of the Great Western series- where the titles of the films are not mentioned in each volume. To avoid duplication in personal collection, the titles have to be mentioned.Please address the problem & rectify the deficiency in info.required by collectors/reviewers.RgdsAshoke P. Mahtani"
1,Disappointment,Had no idea it was just going to be trailers from the movies.Very unhappy with my purchase.
1,Not as represented,"I searched for the film title ""Mirage"" and this Gregory Peck DVD came up. I was delighted to apparently find a copy of this execllent thriller and didn't bother to read the reviews since I already knew I liked the movie. This DVD does not have ""Mirage"" or any other movie; it is a compliation of theatrical trailers!!!"
1,A RIP OFF,Not at all what I thought I was getting. I thought I was getting the movies - instead got trailers. At least I paid a lot less than the price now advertised. Lets see how the refund goes.
3,Trailer collection,"Not what I had hoped it was - a feature film I was looking for - but a nice collection of Trailers from films starring Gregory Peck. Let this be a lesson to you. Always read the description thoroughly before checking out your shopping cart. But Peck was a great film star, and this is a good addition to the collection of any fan."
3,"Pleasantly eccentric, but not great","This CD has a few great moments, such as Monte Warden's version of ""Take Me With U"" and the swingy feel of Christina Marrs' ""Darling Nikki."" However, even the most ardent fan of Austin's musical talent (such as myself) can only take so much of this collection of oddities. This has proven to be more of a conversation piece than an oft-played addition to my collection."
1,The worst piece of trash I have ever heard.,This has to be a joke. Nobody actually bought this right
1,"Wildfire, The Arabian Heart","I bought this movie for my daughters, ages 9 and 14. I'm so sorry to say that what they enjoyed the most about it was making fun of how terrible the acting was, the script, and the lack of a real plot. Yes, this movie is family friendly, and is a good opportunity to discuss what does or doesn't make a good actor, what it takes to create an emotional connection to a character, (there was absolutely nothing to make you fall in love with the horse, Wildfire, or even to really love or hate any other character), and how to write a story that has a solid plot and to see it through. The girls think it's the worst movie they've ever seen. We will probably watch parts of it again to go more in depth with our critique and analysis - great educational value in that, at least. I truly hope the creators of this movie continue in their endeavors, but raise their standards in all areas. Low budget does not have to equal low standard."
1,Wildfire the Arabian Heart,I bought this movie thinking it would be nice to watch. The horse was about the only thing good about it. My high schools drama department has better actors than this movie. The audio to it was also not that good. Some scenes didn't have any sound to them. Not the movie I hoped it would be.
1,Horse actor,"The horse can act. The people can not. Stiff, rigid non emotional acting. Willa is not a sweet country girl but acts like a spoiled rich narcisstic brat."
2,Maybeline is never played!,"The song is never played in it's entirety! A bunch of talking heads explain the significance of this song. Yet, the song is never shown! (kind of like bleeping all the f**** on South Park & MTV.)!!!"
2,Not what I thought,"Not what I thought I was getting. The add picture is incorrect and misleading. I wanted the frame as I threw out the old one. I would have ordered a different wick from a different company, there were some just like this that were cheaper."
1,wrong product number,"I ordered what my humidifier stated I needed to replace the filter,but what I recieved was not the right filter."
2,False Advertising,"Product was not like the picture. Expecting the frame around the filter as picture shows. Filters don't hold up without the frame, filters fall over inside the unit once absorbed with water and humidifier doesn't work efficiently as it should. This is why I hate ordering on line!"
3,Humidifier filter/wicks,"Seem to be OEM replacements so that's good.Fragile, especially when wet. When they degrade, they dissolve into kind of a mess."
3,cute shoes,Cute shoes but my feet bulge at the sides (8M seems more like narrow). I'm not comfortable with the way they look on me so I hardly ever wear them.
1,The writing is laughable,I just about croaked when I saw this title had 5 star reviews.I'll admit the story started out okay but the writing got worse and worse.I gave it up at - As Tap hugged her he thought he heard songbirds nearby but then realized it was just the ringing in his ears.God how awful. Sorry but my time is more valuable than to spend it reading such shlock.
2,Kindle version has typos and formatting issues,"I prefer e-books for convenience. Unfortunately, this one has typos and formatting issues that make some sections (like the tables) nearly impossible to understand unless you've seen a print version. If you're interested in this title, skip the ebook and buy a discounted used copy instead."
2,Not a Christian guide,"Just to be clear about the values promoted in this book, lest anyone get fooled into thinking this is a Christian book. First, the author conforms to popular secular norms in terms of sexual morality. Not only is premarital sex okay in this book, but moving in is also alright if the guy is ""committed"" to you. I would like to remind everyone that fornication and cohabitation without marriage are intrinsically immoral. The author is confused, and if you choose to follow the advice in this book, you will be following a confused woman. I say, live a moral life, don't sweat the small stuff the guy does to annoy you, but expect a strong character from a man (but not perfection), and treat the dude with kindness. Husband is #2 and God is #1, and keep this in mind when you're looking for the person to share your life with. If the guy's wrong, don't despair. Pray to become the woman the Lord wants you to be for the man he wants for you. That's just my opinion."
5,Definitely worth a try,"I have read and browsed quite a few self-help books for single women trying to find mr. right. After hearing about this book from a friend, I browsed it a bit at a bookstore and decided to buy it. I read it over a few days and found that while I didn't agree with everything, I think it's a refreshing way to look at dating and relationships. The biggest lesson I've learned is that I essentially teach men how to treat me. I have been following some of her tips and have found many of the things she says to be true. This books doesn't just stop once you have found that person but it also has plenty of information on how to stay happy in your relationship and deciding whether or not you need to leave it. Most of her suggestions seem like common sense but may take a little bit of practice to follow. I would recommend this book to all single women who have problems finding a relationship or keeping one."
3,Not what you think!,"I know that I, personally, being a Christian, thought that because of the title 'Surrendered Single', that this book was religiously based. However, it is not, just for those of you who are wondering! 'Surrendered Single' was an interesting read, and it brings up some valid points. I don't agree with all of them but overall it was a decent book."
1,Sexist and Useless,"Not only does this book talk down to the reader, but it's advice is both sexist and demeaning. I'm not a feminist by any means, but this book made me feel like one because it was so abhorrent about women's roles in dating. Read this book if you are a passive and depressed -- it will probably make you feel worse."
5,THIS IS THE BOOK THAT WE ALL HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!,"I won't say too much. I have read many books about dating, how to attract mates, etc.; however, most of them were either boring or not practical enough. This book is different!!! She writes so clearly and truthfully without being sarcastic. Everything is laid out in simplistic manner; fortunately for most of us, there is no psychology or sociology gibberish. Just simple, yet effective advices that ALL OF US LADIES CAN USE!! BUY IT!!!"
5,Good Read,"I am very hard to please when it comes to reading dating books, I have done so much research and there is so much riff raft out there. This book is is very well written.Reviewed by Dr. Tikki Collins Author of ""Lord Put A Ring On It"""
3,Not sure how to rate this.,"This book is about letting the guy lead... and what's funny is that if I apply these techniques, they do work. So yeah, if I follow these rules, I can get a boyfriend.What's sad though is that when I use gimmicks to attract a guy, I'm not being myself. What happens when my true personality starts shining through? Also, I'm not sure I want a guy who needs to lead all the time... I'm looking for a partnership where both contribute to the relationship and feel comfortable being themselves, even if that involves the girl calling the guy first, just because she feels like hearing the sound of his voice. If a guy doesn't want me to call him and doesn't want a conversation with me, do I want him?Hmmmm"
1,Slowest card on the Planet!,"If your looking for a card which can keep up to continious shooting, go somewhere else! These cards are really cheap, but along with being cheap they're just too slow....try something which has a little more speed...ks"
1,received something other than what I ordered,"I ordered (2) Dane Elec compact flash camera cards on July 9th. Received order promptly but with (2) totally different cards ~ this brand ""Verbatim."" I decided to try one card anyway instead of hassling with returning but my camera won't shoot with it (I keep getting an error code). Invoice said (2) Dane Elec cards were in the package. Not sure what went wrong but not happy that I have to return & reorder during one of my prime shooting seasons."
2,A practice ball at best...,I am very disappointed in this ball.1. The ball was lopsided for the first three days of having air in it. I can write that off since it has been package for awhile.2. The ball either feels too flat or it is too pumped...there is no in-between.3. The ball bounces far too much and high4. Some of the panels stick out further than the other causing the ball to roll unevenly on the floor5. In the rain the ball is far too slick with the glossy surface / In the sun or heat the ball gets stuck under the foot very easilyI should have invested more money and gone with a nicer ball but I assumed since this was the same ball I played with in college (I dont remember them being this poor) and the ball they used/use for NCAA it would be sufficient to play with... I was wrong and its being tucked away in the garage as its too frustrating to play with.
1,"Brine size 5 = size 4, and low quality","I'm never buying another Brine soccer ball. I have tried to find the right Brine ball for me, but they don't make the correct size anymore and their quality has diminished. I received one of these ""size 5"" that appear to be size 4 as a gift and only after using it outside two days it got cuts and scratches on it just from hitting the goalpost a few times."
1,Bad ball and bad service,"The ball we received was out of round. We have been trying to contact the vendor to replace the ball,Brine NCAA Championship Match Soccer Ball (White/Black) and have been unsuccessful in them answering emails or phone calls.I would never order from this vendor again."
3,May not be worth the upgrade!,"I upgraded the 2004 version to this version (2005) and found it to be faster but most of the other improvements were bug fixes that should have been made to the 2004 version without an upgrade price. They seem to take the Microsoft approach of making customers pay for bug fixes. If the few, new features and faster speed are enough for you then get it!"
2,Not worth upgrade; little to nothing has been improved,I found little to no improvements in this new version of Quicken versus the 2004 version. It is simply not worth upgrading if you own the 2004 version. Previous version owners may find an upgrade more compelling depending on how old their version is.
1,Ho-hum . . . Mac users get short-shrift - - again.,"My only regret about having switched from Windows to Mac 2 years ago is that Microsoft does not make MS Money for Mac, thus forcing me to go back to Quicken. MS Money for Windows has it all-over Quicken for Windows. Sadly, Quicken is the only game in town for mac users. Even more sad, Intuit knows this, and offers a stripped-down version of Quicken for Mac that appears to reflect its seeming conceit. If you already have Quicken for Mac 2004, I would recommend NOT wasting your time or cash on this ""upgrade"". It is not worth it."
2,It's not so bad... just more of the same,"After ""upgrading"" from the 2002 edition, I was suprised that after 3 years Intuit hadn't managed to make any real improvements besides making the icons a little prettier. The new features I describe as ""fluff"" at best.The software itself is OK, but there is no reason for anybody to spend any money to update from an earlier version. This software is in any case no reason to make the switch from Windows. Quicken for Mac is still greatly inferior to even Quicken1999 for Windows!"
1,Crash Prone,"I purchased Quicken 2005 because I like it's user interface. However, it has crashed 4 times in 2 months... It seems to crash when downloading electronic transactions. Web-based technical support is good, but they can't fix software bugs.Also, I couldn't set up more than one electronic bank account with the same bank. I had to create a completely new file for it. This is a real pain if you and your spouse have seperate checking accounts. I actually have to open a completely new file to access my account!"
2,Finally better than Windows?,"At least they haven't dropped support for QIF imports from the Mac version. The 2005 version for Windows drops this ability, so if that is all your bank supports, you are SOL! All you can do is switch to a bank that pays Intuit to be able to provide QFX files, beg your bank to switch, or enter transactions manually."
4,reviews are to harsh,"The negative reviews of this product on Amazon.com are very harsh and inaccurate. I purchased Quicken a few weeks ago and have been very satisfied with it. It it has it quirks and is possibly not as complete or refined as the PC version, but it IS reliable, and it DOES get the job done. I have used previous versions of Quicken on the PC (98) and I find this very comparable with many significant improvements. The mac version is unable to connect to far fewer financial institutions than the Windows version, but this is primarily due to those institutions not providing mac support. Overall it is the best financial software on the market for the mac. If you are looking for something else try Budget (www.versiontracker.com), it is only $30 and you can try it for free. It is unique but doesn't have near the features of quicken. I eventually switched to Quicken."
1,I recommend...,"I recommend to anyone reading this review to invest in Virtual PC for Mac and purchase Quicken for Windows, or better yet purchase MS Money. I too have recently switched to Mac and Virtual PC gives me the best of both worlds. But even as a work around it is still a good idea to write/email/call Intuit and give them feedback regarding the huge disparity between their Windows and Mac products. The more Mac users speak-out, the more Intuit will be open to invest in their Mac products."
1,Quicken drops web connect for older versions??,"I've benn using Quicken 2002 for Mac to download web connect statements from Bank of America California for years, when suddenly today I get an error message saying ""Quicken is currently unable to verify the financial institution informantion for this download.""Why on earth would Quicken disable part of the program that I spent $60 bucks on? Is this Intuit's way of forcing me to spend another $60 to upgrade to the latest version of Quicken that so many people (here and at Intuit's Quicken Mac forum) are complaining about?If this is the case I'm dumping Quicken and switching over to Moneydance. It's a great Mac personal finance program that I've been experimenting with for a few months now. It's only $30 and their tech support personally replies to my emails within 24 hours.Is Quicken abandoning their Mac customers? If so, why would we upgrade? And why does Apple include Quicken with iMac?"
1,I should have heeded the advise of the other reviewers,I have used Quicken since 1999. During a recent change to MAC from PC I purchased the Quicken 2005. I am very disappointed with the program. It is cumbersome and does not do many of the things that 2004 did and if it does I can't figure out how. I plan on going back to 2004. This was a total waste of money.
2,For those looking for something OTHER than Quicken,"I've been reading the Quicken reviews on Amazon and on other locations, and have been sufficiently scared away from purchasing an upgrade to work with Mac OS 10.4. After much searching, I found that there IS another money management system that works with the Mac, called Moneydance. I don't know how well it works, although the reviews I've read have averaged 4 stars. They offer a free trial version to download from their Web site (which is, it seems, the only place where it can be purchased); hopefully, I can determine whether it's going to work for me.So there is more than Quicken for the Mac. Move over, Intuit!"
1,Lacking many important features,"I switched to a Mac computer a few months ago after using Windows (and Quicken for windows) for 15+ years. I was told by both Intuit and Mac reps that Quicken for Mac Basic is the same as the Windows version. It is NOT. For example, the Mac version is not able to sort a register by Payee, can't find all transactions with a certain payee, date, etc. and recategorize ...and many other basic features that the Windows version. No 401K tracking, no ability to set up many kinds of investments....agh. The list goes on and on. Only when I called Intuit after I purchased and asked very specific questions about specific features did I get the real answers....Net, a poor financial software program. (Re-hooked up an old Windows machine just to handle my finances...what a disappointment.)"
2,Quicken for MAC disappoints,"Quicken 2005 works ok, but it has a couple of big problems that make it virtually useless for me. I've used Quicken on Windows for 6 years and have been able to download asset classes for each stock, bond, or mutual fund I own. I manage my investments using assset allocation - ie, by trakcing the % of my holdings large cap, small cap, international, bonds, and cash. Quicken 2005 for Mac doesn't have this function. Also, the whole program works in 9-point font only. Rows and rows of little tiny numbers and you can't change it. Not so great for the aging population of consumers."
4,"Regarding ""bad math""","Another customer had a problem with 10% on 10,000 for one year being more than 11,000. Quicken is not doing it wrong, they are compounding the interest, the way it should be done. There is nothing wrong with the financial calculators, you just not doing math the way financial institutions do."
1,WARNING! Will Not Work With E*Trade,"I suppose I should have checked with Intuit's list of supported financial institutions, but neither E*Trade Financial or E*Trade Bank are supported for this version of Quicken. I find it hard to believe that one of the world's largest all-Web financial institutions would leave Mac users out in the cold. What is more frustrating is that it worked fine for Windows -- it seems like a simple file format problem that could be easilty addressed by Intuit & E*Trade.So take this review with a grain of salt -- I cannot really review a product that I have been unable to use at all!"
3,THE inside scoop on Miss Josephine,"This is a biography of LaBaker written by one of her many adopted children. He gives the inside dish on his mom, including that both she and his adopter father were gay. He points out too that she did have some self-loathing issues regarding her race as well. This book has a great photo section. It helped me to see the ugly side of Josephine that wasn't fully presented in the great movie by HBO. I am not sure it is the best work out there, but it is a must-read for any Josephine fans and scholars. In addition, people that study Black Americans abroad or French naturalized citizens should read this."
5,Well written unusual story,"For me, this is the most Roman feeling novel, just as Satyricon is the most Roman feeling film."
2,Love Book - Hate binding,This is a wonderful story - fun to read aloud - even over and over again and lovely graphics. I bought a second copy to give as a gift and was most disappointed in the binding. I knew it would be paperback - but this is just folded over and stapled with two staples. Can't imagine it will last through more than a couple of readings. Not nice enough to give.
2,Not for the average joe...,"I have to admit that I was disappointed with the ammount of psychobabble in this book. Granted, some sections were less painful to read than others. It has accurate, good quality information and they made great use of example, however, the book tends to restate itself to the point of redundancy. I was more enthralled reading the textbook from Developmental Psychology. I would not recommend it to a rugby fan or enthusiast, but would recommend it for coaches or a dedicated player looking to put a name to something that they are probably already doing."
2,wouldn't buy it again,"delivery:right on timecondition: second hand, good condition so I can recommend the seller. not a single page is damaged. the only note is that the book was filthy on the outside (just cleaned it with a wet cloth and it was ok)content: it's all about psyco mambo jumbo. how you have to visualize the moment, repeat to yourself ""i'm the best"" and all that shrink stuff.will most likely give it to my 2 year old to play with"
4,How Rugby Touch can assist new players to the sport.,"This book gives a very good overview of all aspects of the sport from playing, coaching, and refereeing. It is an excellent communication tool for players new to the game as well as informative to veterans who have not played or kept in touch with new rules, strategies, and drills. I particularly enjoyed the coaching section as that currently interests me. For 15 years, I primarily played tight-head prop (and some hooker, some flanker, some #8, - who hasn't filled in where needed??) and appreciate the ""Front Row"" discussions - lots of unique memories were resurrected. - I am 61 and have not played a match in 16 years, but I have helped coach a college side at Eastern Kentucky Univ where I currently am a professor."
4,Lovely stuff...,"Spokane's 'Measurement' is a beautiful and subdued album. Their sound is built around restrained and somber boy/girl vocals, subtle string parts and gentle shades of piano and guitar. Labradford's Robert Donne also contributes bass guitar on this their third album giving it a warm and steady foundation. Definitely worth investigating if you are a fan of Low, Kepler, Codeine, Windy and Carl or even shoegazer bands like Slowdive."
5,Greatest Book Ever,"I am 39 years old. I have read literally thousands and thousands of books in my life. This is the BEST book I have ever read. After you read this you will wan to go out and ACCOMPLISH something. Just the quotes in the book alone are worth the price. If you have a teenager who plays basketball, buy him or her this book. But you dont have to be an athlete to love it. THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ."
5,be the very best you can be!,"Lots of insightful quotes from various NBA athletes and coaches on how MJ became one of the world's best basketball players. But you don't have to be a professional athlete to benefit from the advice. Good quotes from people like Winston Churchhill, Beethoven, etc. scattered throughout the book in easy to read captions. This is a good companion to classics like ""Think and Grow Rich."" A bit disorganized in places though."
3,Only if you want to round out your collection.........,"Ok, TOP Fan from 1973 on, in fact, just caught their act here in Seattle in Feb 07 - great live band. That being said, only get this album if you are trying to complete your collection, sounds electronic, disco-ish, and not the ol-funk we all love....even the liner notes are kind of a downer- does not feel like the TOP I know. If you don't have any TOP, run right out and buy ""Tower of Power"" or the Urban Renewal disk, then Bump City, Back to Oakland and the live disks, much better place to park your cash..."
4,What this is -,"Before going on tour Ozz filmed some parodies to be shown on the over viewing screens. Before he went on stage they would play this. Doing / filmed like Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump. Oz talks to Gump, dances in Saturday Night Fever, vogues with Madonna, sings with the Three Tenors, Rides with Pulp Fiction Travolta & Jackson. Plus some other funny stuff. Black Sabbath & Family Footage Archives"
3,Not much to it,Well I thought it would be really cool to customize my Razer and I was excited about doing it. Not very satisfied with the results. Making it heavier makes it harder to slide on the surface. I was looking to make it feel more solid and it sort of did but not worth the cost of harder sliding.Also the top is hard to reattach and has to be fiddled with to get it to seat.Another item is that the new Razer Logo disc on the top sticks up and is not comfortable to me.I wound up taking the weight out and putting the original logo disc on the top onto the new silver top. I even had to super glue it on as the disc is not made to be easily removed and the tabs snapped off.I basically paid the price to just have a silver top shell and nothing else. I LOVE my mouse but this kit doesn't do it for me. It does have new teflon feet for the bottom that I also found useful.
2,"Good base, poor remote","I got this along with the Belkin car FM tuner. Both base units work as advertised and come with snap-in plates for every pluggable ipod. However, the remote has a lot of difficulty remaining sync'd with the base unit. Every time a playlist ends the remote looses connectivity (or even sooner). I tend to jump around and pick individual songs or albums (rather that create a long playlist for random listening). The lack of a menu button (to search for the next song) and problems with re-syncing after every album ends greatly diminishes my enthusiasm for this unit. Also, the volume increase and decrease buttons STICK (i.e. you hit 'up' once and the volume will continue to increase to maximum). This is unacceptable and a safety hazard. Perhaps I have a dud unit... however, I shouldn't have to debug a simple device like this."
2,Belkin Hell,"I've tried two Belkin products now, this one and the Belkin SportsCommand. Both products are utterly disappointing, especially the TuneCommand since it's so much more expensive. The SportsCommand's buttons don't work. They go in but it's touch and go whether they come out. I'm amazed Belkin released this cause it doesn't take long to see it's complete trash.On the other hand the TuneCommand takes a while longer to realize the quality problems; The receiver stops listening to the remote and then you have to switch the power on and off to reset it, only to have it happen again 5 minutes later. This happens over and over.I'm amazed this product has any 5 star ratings. Either the raters haven't used this product extensively, or my product was a lemon; but if it was a lemon, why have none of my Belkin purchases been good ones?Be warned, you WILL regret your decision to buy Belkin products. I now search Google with -Belkin in the search query."
3,not quite what I had in mind,"First of all, I bought this to use with music, not really to connect to the tv.The cord is a bit too short in my opinion, so connecting it to the dock where I wanted it to be in my apartment was a bit tricky. Then my remote doesn't always work, then I'll have to reconnect the cord to the dock to re-establish the connection, which is a bit annoying. And I don't know whether it was my misunderstanding, but I somehow thought I could control the volume with the remote, but I can't. Maybe it's down to the fact I'm connecting this to Harman Kardon Soundsticks, not a proper stereo system with the whole works (cd player, radio, dvd and stuff)..But then again, the dock looks good and the remote works from quite a distance!"
5,Gr8 product,These little babies are much better that the rest! I use them on all our kitchen chairs. The kitchen is ceramic tile and these babies make sliding the chairs easy. I have tried less expensive products and been disappointed. They last about a year with heavy use.
3,Not bad,"I like that these are portable, have no added sugar, and count as a fruit serving. They don't quite taste like grape to me but they're not bad. Good for a snack any time."
3,"right product, wrong size...","I would be completely satisfied with this product, except that it doesn't fit my kenmore...and it turns out that range-kleen is the only drip pan that Sears sells too...The porcelain is very very easy to clean, and very convenient...I love it , but can't use it..."
2,Didn't fit my Kenmore,"Ordered item for my Kenmore range, didn't fit. The smaller 6 inch pans fit well but the larger 8 inch were too large. Returning item. Will have to look elsewhere, maybe OEM."
3,"Good quality, confusing application","the (2) small pans were great the (2) large pans did not fit at all, the listing was a little confusing as to what other ranges they would fit, so was hard to tell if I had ordered the right set , but Amazon did give me an adyustment on the price."
2,reason for my returning this product,"I am returning this product because , although good quality, they do not fit my frigidare stove. They do not stay in place. This product should state what stoves they will fit. Also I am not pleased that I have to pay return shipping. I have bought a few other items from amazon and was very satisfied."
1,Parts arrived damaged,"When this product arrived, the two larger pans were bent and dinged, in far worse shape than the drip pans I was trying to replace. (Note, this product was shipped by a 3rd party vendor, and not by Amazon.) Even if the larger drip pans were not bent, I could not have used them. It turns out the large drip pans do not fit my Kenmore stove (in contrast with the product advertisement). The fit for the large drip pans is off by about 1/8"" in diameter. The smaller pans were in good shape and fit my Kenmore stove fine."
2,The large ones did not fit my old Frididaire,"Although 3 of the 4. 2 small and 1 large, did fit, the one large one did not. a year later I tried one I found at Lowe's, and it fit perfect. I recommend buying for Fridigaire at Lowes."
3,Compatability,"Description says it fits most stoves including Kenmore. The small pans fit my newer Kenmore but the large ones are not even close. They came in a set of four, not sure what I will do with them."
3,Size discrepancy,"They are well made. The smaller ones fit fine but the larger ones did not fit my Kenmore. Upon measuring, The outer edges are 9.75"" and mine were 9.25"". The edge of the inner base measures 8"" but mine were 7.75"".......Make sure you measure before ordering..."
4,Looks good and Easy to clean,"Though expensive, it looks good and much easier to clean than the cheaper ones I found in walmart. It fits better too."
5,Great buy,These were a perfect fit and the quality are as good as the originals. If I would have known how nice they were I would have ordered more than one set.
3,Does not fit,Two smaller ones fit fine but the larger ones do not fit in the holes right. Had to send back but Amazon was very prompt at having them picked up and credited my account immediately upon receiving. Wish they would have fit because they are very nice.
2,"They seem good quality, but the size is incorrectly described so I can't use them.","The sizes of the holes in our stovetop are 8 and 6 inches. The sizes given in the detailed description for these pans are 8 and inches, but they are really 8.5 and 6.25 inches so are too big to fit our stove. The shipping cost to return them is more than the refund would be, so I'll find somebody locally who can use them. So -3 stars for the misleading description that led me to believe these otherwise nice pans would fit my stove."
5,Great product,"This is a great set of pans. 100% fit to my GE electric range and looks durable. Shipping is very fast, price is good."
2,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK IF:,"If you expect any pictures to give you a feel for the place, then don't buy this book. The picture on the cover is the only thing you'll get.Where I'm coming from: I don't travel to shop, eat, meet the locals or absorb new culture: I go to see beautiful man-made and natural wonders. An hour spent at a sidewalk cafe absorbing the ""atmosphere"" is an hour that could be spent seeing more of a castle, cathedral, museum, mountain, lake etc.Perhaps if you already know what you want to see, what's worth seeing in Norway, then the information in the book might be useful. But if you've never been to the place before, BUY THE EYEWITNESS SERIES books, they have pictures and 3D perspective drawings of specific neighborhoods give a nice feel for what one might want to see."
4,"Got ""I Got a Right"" on CD?","If you don't, and like me had to put on the single, buy this.But there is more here.There is some great live stuff here. From ""No Fun"" (a medly with the superior ""Waitin' For My Man"") to ""You Really Got Me"" to ""Batman"" (of all things), Iggy is in fine form. And the production is generally very good."
2,A trick for Iggy's fan,"Iggy is a great artist.But the sound quality on these two cds is awful.You shouldn't buy Nugggets, unless you want to waste your money, as I did."
2,Poor switch design ruins an otherwise good product.,"Lightweight, surprisingly bright for their size and really handy, thse lights would be a great buy if they didn't suffer from one fatal flaw: their switches appear to be very poorly designed or constructed.I purchaced three of these for stocking stuffers in addition to one for myself. One has already died due to a stuck 'on' switch. Mine seems to turn on if it's breathed on (VERY sensitive switch). So we're batting .500 with less than one month's use.As such, I cannot recommend these minilights."
2,Turns on too easily to carry in a pocket,I'm pretty much reaffirming the review of M. Bergeron. I found that the light switches on way too easily. The clever cycle of switch settings becomes a disadvantage when it is getting switched on by accident. It's a nice little flashlight when the being on is happening while you want it to be. It might have great battery life if the time being on were only when I wanted it to be. Instead it is mostly squandered illuminating the inside of my pocket.
2,Translucent case was a bad idea.,"Great light, major flaw:The ""side lobe"" spillover from the translucent case is overwhelming on a dark night. Go with the regular version."
3,Light will turn off automatically after 10 or 15 minutes,"This light is bright and long lasting BUT it will automatically turn off after 10 or 15 minutes if you leave it on. Perhaps this is a safety feature to save battery and most people won't care, but I used this as part of a Halloween costume and it was annoying to have to keep turning it back on every 15 minutes. Other than that, good light.Also, you can get these at almost any FRY's for 7 bucks if you want to avoid shipping costs. I found that out after I bought one on Amazon and then went to Fry's for some other stuff."
4,Innova light,It works as expected. The last one I bought didn't have a very sturdy switch; it warped over time. I'll see how this one goes.
3,Not a multi-mode lite!,"Seems well built, but it has only a slide switch for constant on (no hi-lo-strobe) and a momentary on touch switch. I was banking on the hi-lo finctions. Oh Well!"
5,Favorite Pet Shampoo,I originally found this shampoo at Target along with the wipes. They have stopped carrying this brand which put me in a panic. I love this stuff for my dogs. Lathers well and makes the puppies smell nice. Glad it's still around.Really like all Mrs. Meyers products.
4,Mystery,I found this book difficult to put down. It was a mystery from beginning to end and kept me in suspense.This isn't the type of book I normally read and can't remember why I purchased it to begin with but once I picked it up and started reading I was hooked in the story.
2,Too simplistic and uses periodic inventory method.,"I ordered this practice set to test and exercise ERP software. I wanted to enter and manipulate master inventory items, bills of material, work orders, mrp, purchase orders, sales orders, vouchers, invoices, general journals, ending up in financial statements with schedules especially for perpetual inventory. Instead, this book gives one month's worth of periodic inventory and non-inventory transactions with expected trial balance and retained earnings figures given. I'm not finding what I need out there, so I think I will just supplement this book with inventory transaction detail."
4,Great for young and old.,This little book has many interesting photos with just the right amount of text for a grade school child to follow or for anyone who wants a simple introductory book on Roadrunners.
4,Short and sweet,"This book is not long enough to be a very in-depth study of the subject, but for the amount of space allotted, it covers a lot of ground and provides quite a bit of information. And, of course, the photos are spectacular. It didn't answer EVERY question I had on the subject, but it was a very good start."
3,"Great item, but expensive",What is there to say about this item. It does exactly what it says. I don't see why it has to cost so much though.
4,Great!! but....,"This product is great, but it doesn't includes the cable that you need to connect the ipod, i would suggest that all the vendors include it and don't sell it separately, because if you don't have it, you can't use it and the usb cable that cames with the ipod cannot be plugged into the charger."
2,Not very descriptive...,"They should of listed in the products title what kind of connection it takes.Obviously it says firewire in the products description, but it should of been in the title. Just saying."
2,30 minutes of Gator toy animals and balls,"Instaed of buying this video, I suggest you videotape some Gator stuff (shirt, football, stuffed gator) and put these clips on your video over and over and over. Repetition for tots is a good thing usually, but this video is not exciting. And for an older tot, there is very little on Gator trditions or campus. There is a section called Traditions but it only included Mr. 2 Bits and then afterward would say ""Football,"" ""Volleyball,"" ""Baseball...""There has got to be a better video out there for getting kids interested in Gator Nation!"
1,sand,"The product came with a smashed corner on the box but there didn't appear to be any damage so I accepted the product. Inside the box, along with the tape dispenser was --sand! I thought the pkg was compromised but once I set the dispenser up I realized the sand was from inside the dispenser itself. I have been unable to seal it sufficiently to stop the constant seepage of sand all over my black glass computer desk. It's not worth the hassel to return it but I can tell you ""I ain't happy""."
5,A DIVER'S COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE,"THE AUTHOR OBVIOUSLY IS A DIVING ENTHUSIAST AND HISTORY BUFF. CLEARLY, EXHAUSTIVELY RESEARCHED IN IT'S DETAIL AND INTEREST. FACTS HAVE BEEN CHECKED AND DOUBLE-CHECKED FOR ACCURACY. THE AUTHOR TRULY WAS A PERFECTIONIST. THANKS MARK."
4,Great stuff,"Dear music fan, this is another one of those bands whose name you can never pronounce just right. This is one of those reviews that doesn't really seem like a review but just some quick notes written on a napkin in a bar in Hollywood. Maybe the thoughts also came to me in Brooklyn too. I don't want to bring my parents into this review. They would kill me if they knew I was writing about them. This is a New York band that has been around for a few years. They released one record, which was mostly created by James Baluyut. As the years passed other members joined and they played more shows. They create moody urban music for people in between relationships. It is a combination of electronic music and rock. It has a cool attitude. One could imagine people listening to this music wearing berets and smoking French cigarettes."
4,Incomplete!,"I won't repeat how good the gals of Fanny were and how this tribute set has been long way overdue, but where the hell is Butter Boy? For those of you not in the know, it was Fanny's best shot at true stardom and just maybe their best song. It's a great tune! It's omission from this set is glaring! Anyone out there know why it was left off? Not on the Reprise label? The four star rating is not because of Butter Boy missing in action, it's because there's too much repeat material to warrant this many CDs. There's got to be more unheard recorded or live material out there. I guess you can't always get want you want, but if you try sometimes...Still, a whole lot better than what was available before! Fanny still rocks!"
5,Fanny,"I loved this group when I was 18. They came to the University of Houston to play and , even though I was not a student, went to see them in person. The best live show I have ever seen. Music was clean and clear and my little brother , who was 15, danced to their music in the UC.I have had all their albums and played them till they were so worn, I had to throw them away.If you like Girl Bands and you like good music, Fanny is it! This release brings back the good ole days when life was good and simple. Rock on!"
4,cd1 meh cd 2 sick,"cd1 has a couple decent tracks but cd2 is solid all up until the last track, id say cd2 counts as one of his top 3 best mixes."
3,"listen to what you're reviewing,dont just see the name","people r too quick to claim that anything coming from tiesto is brilliant.ive been disappointed with tiestos more recent stuff but i love the isos series so def had to get this soon as i saw it.well on my first listen i must say i was quite disappointed.while i know a vocal trance track can b a good break up there is far too much monotonous vocal tracks on disc one.nothing separates them,all the voices sound the same and ther is no build up,no climax,no nothing.track 7 is my favourite trackDisc 2 redeems itself somewhat as per usual its darker,the vocals r cut back and we get into sum proper trance.i think isos4 was a much better album but this is def a must have for tiesto fans"
3,Confused...,"Compared to previous compilations, I'll give it a little over 3. I still miss the Tiesto from Nyana..."
